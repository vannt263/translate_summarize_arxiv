    "with increasing intensity , the spectral line profiles that are calculated for astrophysical masers first become narrower and then rebroaden when the masers become saturated . at high saturation",
    ", the profile in doppler velocity becomes the same as the maxwellian ( gaussian ) velocity distribution of the masing molecules .",
    "this behavior has been established to be independent of whether the masers are treated as linear ( @xcite ) , or as having finite cross sections such as disks and spheres ( @xcite ; wyld & watson 2002 , in preparation ) .",
    "it seems to be less widely recognized that the profiles also can be negligibly different from gaussians at low intensities where the maser is unsaturated .",
    "we demonstrate how the deviations of the profile from gaussian can ( along with the breadth of the profile ) then be used to obtain information about the masers .",
    "in particular , lack of knowledge about the solid angle into which the maser radiation is beamed  which is necessary to obtain the luminosity and the energy density from the observed radiative flux  has been an outstanding weakness in the interpretation of astrophysical masers .    at low angular resolution ,",
    "the observed spectral line profiles are not expected to be indicative of the profiles of individual masers because multiple masing components may be present within a telescope beam . however , the profiles presented here have been observed at very high angular resolution with the very long baseline array ( vlba ) and are quite close to gaussian .",
    "most likely , the deviations from gaussian in these profiles are upper bounds to the actual deviations in the profiles of individual masers .",
    "the 22 ghz h@xmath1o  maser profiles toward w3 irs 5 shown in figure[fmp ]  were obtained with the vlba in order to measure the circular polarization of the maser radiation , and hence to infer the strengths of the magnetic fields .",
    "also shown in this figure are the gaussian fits and the differences between the fits and the data . the observational procedures to obtain these profiles",
    "have been described in a previous letter ( @xcite ) . here",
    "we examine the near - gaussian nature of the profiles .",
    "w3 irs 5 is an infrared double source located between the  regions a and b in the w3 giant molecular cloud ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite  found seven hypercompact continuum sources ( diameter @xmath2 700 au : @xcite ) in the w3 irs 5 region with the very large array ( vla ) .",
    "they interpreted these sources as stellar winds from embedded b stars ( cf .",
    "these authors also found that some of the brightest h@xmath1o  masers coincide with the locations of 15 ghz continuum images of the hypercompact sources . from the flux in the observed profiles and the maser sizes ( assumed unresolved ; hence sizes are the half - power beamwidth , which is @xmath30.7 mas ) , we find that the minimum brightness temperatures @xmath4 for the masers in figure [ fmp ]  are 1 to 4 @xmath5 @xmath6  k.",
    "the equation of transfer for the dimensionless intensity @xmath7 of a ray of maser radiation at doppler velocity @xmath8 can be expressed as a function of the optical depth parameter @xmath9 in the linear maser idealization as    @xmath10   \\exp\\left (   -v^{2}/0.36v_{t}^{2}\\right ) \\label{e1}\\ ] ]    here , the @xmath11 =  @xmath7 is in units of the saturation intensity @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the frequency of the transition , @xmath14 is the `` phenomenological '' decay rate of the molecular state , @xmath15 are the degeneracies of the upper and lower states , @xmath16 is the einstein a - value , and @xmath17 is the beaming angle for the maser radiation . also , the source function due to spontaneous emission @xmath18 $ ] where @xmath19 is the phenomenological pumping rate into the upper state and @xmath20 is the difference between the pumping rates into the upper and lower states .",
    "the dispersion ( fwhm ) in the thermal velocities of the masing molecules is @xmath21 .",
    "if spontaneous emission is ignored , equation  [ e1 ]  can be integrated to yield @xmath22=i_{c}\\exp[s\\exp(-v^{2}/0.36v_{t}^{2})]$ ] for @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the intensity of the continuum radiation that is incident at the far end of the maser which serves as the `` seed '' radiation for the maser .",
    "the @xmath7 that is found by integrating equation [ e1 ]  is fit to a gaussian using the least squares procedure .",
    "the result @xmath25 of dividing the integral of the squares of the normalized deviations by the linewidth @xmath26 ( fwhm ) of the computed profile @xmath27^{2}dv\\}/i_{p}^{2}\\delta v_{1/2 } \\label{e2}\\ ] ] is then adopted as a quantitative measure of the deviation of the spectral line profile from a gaussian . here ,",
    "@xmath28 and @xmath29 are the parameters of the gaussian that are obtained in the least squares fitting and @xmath30 @xmath31 is the peak intensity within the spectral line .",
    "note that @xmath25 is independent of @xmath21 ( that is , of the kinetic temperature of the gas ) and that @xmath26 @xmath32 @xmath21 @xmath5 @xmath33(@xmath34 when @xmath35 is ignored .",
    "the function @xmath33(@xmath34 @xmath36 as @xmath30 ( which also is a measure of the degree of saturation ) becomes much greater than one",
    ". in figure  [ fkl ] examples of the variations of the calculated @xmath25 and @xmath26 are shown as a function of the peak intensity @xmath30 ( or the degree of saturation ) for @xmath24 = @xmath37 , which we will reason subsequently is representative for the data in   [ sobs ] . clearly , the main deviations in @xmath7 from a gaussian occur in the region of partial saturation .",
    "the two curves for the linewidth have different values for @xmath21 , and are thus shifted vertically from one another by a constant factor . the horizontal line in figure  [ fkl ]",
    "intersects these two curves at different points , and is used to indicate that a specific linewidth ordinarily is compatible with a range of gas temperatures and a range of degrees of saturation .",
    "the intersections determine the corresponding @xmath30 and @xmath25 when a linewidth of 0.5 results from gas at the two temperatures . in figure",
    "[ fivst ] , the relationship is shown between the intensity @xmath30 and the gas temperature ( scaled ) which yield a specific linewidth @xmath26 , for several values of @xmath24 .",
    "note that the information in figure  [ fivst ]  can be scaled as described in the caption for any linewidth and molecular species .",
    "the `` kurtosis ''  a quantitative measure of whether the profile is more [ positive ] or less [ negative ] peaked than the gaussian at line center ( e.g. , @xcite )  also is shown in figure  [ fkl ] . that the kurtosis changes sign at essentially the value of @xmath30 where the linewidth is a minimum and where the saturation begins to be significant is a further indication of the change in the character of the spectral line at this point .",
    "we find that , at least for the ranges that are considered here for the parameters , spontaneous emission yields results that differ negligibly from those obtained for incident continuum radiation with @xmath38 .",
    "we thus present results labelled only according to the @xmath24 , but with the understanding that they are applicable for @xmath39 as well .",
    "the relevant characteristics for the profiles in figure  [ fmp ]  are ( @xmath26 km @xmath40 , @xmath25 ) = c  ( 0.7 , 2.4 @xmath5 @xmath41 ) , nw ( 0.7 , 2.4 @xmath5 @xmath0 ) , se ( 0.5 , 1.8 @xmath5 @xmath0 ) , and for a fourth profile observed by @xcite  but not shown in the figure , ( 0.5 , 8.5 @xmath5 @xmath0 ) . at least within the relevant range of values for @xmath24 that is considered in figure  [ fivst ] , the values of @xmath30 at which specific @xmath25 occur are essentially independent of @xmath24 when @xmath42 @xmath41 . hence , to be compatible with the observed profiles in   [ sobs ]  for which three have @xmath25 @xmath43 @xmath41 , the intensity must either be quite large ( @xmath44 100 ) or it must be somewhat less than 1 according to figure  [ fkl ] .",
    "we reject the high saturation solutions because ( i ) the required saturation seems excessive , but more objectively because ( ii ) the gas temperatures @xmath45 that would be indicated ( @xmath46 100 k for @xmath26 = 0.5 km @xmath40 ) in figure  [ fivst ]  are below what seems to be required for the chemistry and pumping of these masers , and ( iii ) the 22 ghz h@xmath1o   maser feature probably consists of a blend of three hyperfine components .",
    "hyperfine structure is omitted here , but would cause irregular profiles at temperatures of a few hundred k. at these temperatures , @xmath47 is too small in comparison with the hyperfine splittings for the components to merge completely .",
    "in addition , ( iv ) the `` kurtosis '' of the four line profiles that are observed is positive as is expected from figure  [ fkl ]  for maser profiles at @xmath48 0.3 , but not for larger @xmath30 .",
    "also , the residuals at the intensity peak for two of the three profiles in figure  [ fmp](and for a fourth profile that is not shown ) are positive , directly indicating that the observed profiles are more sharply peaked ( positive kurtosis ) than the gaussian fit . for the third profile shown in figure[fmp ]  ( maser se ) , the peak in the residual is shifted by one velocity channel from the peak in the observed profile .",
    "now consider the likely ranges for @xmath49 @xmath37@xmath50 and @xmath51 @xmath37@xmath52 , where the background continuum intensity has been expressed as a brightness temperature @xmath53 and the usual estimate for the 22 ghz masers @xmath14 = 2 @xmath40  has been adopted . in calculations for the pumping of these masers , the fractional inversion",
    "@xmath54 typically is a few percent ( e.g. , @xcite ) to give @xmath55 @xmath56@xmath17 .",
    "plausible values for @xmath53 range from little more than the 3k cosmic background to the @xmath57  k that is characteristic of  regions .",
    "then , since it is unimportant for the calculated spectra whether the seed radiation is provided by spontaneous or by background radiation , for convenience we can express the likely range for the seed radiation in terms of @xmath24 alone with @xmath57  @xmath44 @xmath53 ( k ) @xmath44 @xmath58 . because @xmath59 can be related to @xmath25 , it is useful to eliminate @xmath17 and express @xmath60 as @xmath61 = @xmath62 k)/(@xmath63 k ) ] , or @xmath64 here , since @xmath65 = @xmath6  k is a lower limit for the data in   [ sobs ] . the locations on the curves in figure  [ fivst ]  where @xmath66 are indicated by the dotted line .",
    "the upper end of this line is at @xmath30 = 0.3 ( and @xmath24 = 3 @xmath5 @xmath37 )  the value at which @xmath25 = 3 @xmath5 @xmath0  in figure  [ fmp ] .",
    "hence , the allowed region in figure  [ fivst ]  is that indicated by the arrows , and this dotted line indicates the lowest gas temperatures that are compatible with the two profiles in   [ sobs ]  that are closest to gaussian profiles  and probably with the other two profiles as well in view of the sense of the uncertainties in @xmath53 , @xmath4 and @xmath25 . in turn",
    ", @xmath17 can be related to the intensities and brightness temperatures of the masers through @xmath17 = ( 4@xmath67 k ) ster .",
    "it is evident that the foregoing analysis indicates that the maser profiles described in   [ sobs ]  originate in gas that is quite hot  if taken at face value , in gas with temperatures greater than about 1200 k and 2500 k based on the spectral lines with widths of 0.5 ( @xmath25 = 1.8 @xmath5 @xmath0 , and 8.5 @xmath5 @xmath0 ) and 0.7 km @xmath40  ( @xmath25 = 2.4 @xmath5 @xmath0 ) , respectively .    for simplicity",
    ", the foregoing analysis has been based on a two - level maser transition and the linear maser idealization .",
    "the 22 ghz transition probably is a blend of three hyperfine components .",
    "though this can influence the analysis in detail , our initial calculations indicate that the basic conclusion that the observations imply @xmath68 0.3 and high gas temperatures greater than about 1000 k will be unaltered .",
    "perhaps surprisingly , the line profiles that result from the three merged hyperfine components still tend to be good gaussians except at the lowest temperatures .",
    "again for simplicity , we have not dealt explicitly with the possibility that the rate @xmath69 for the relaxation of molecular velocities by the trapping of infrared radiation can be greater than the decay rate @xmath14 of the state ( @xcite ) .",
    "if so , @xmath69 will replace @xmath14 in our calculations ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , @xmath14 will be reduced by the trapping , and @xmath69 will have approximately the rate ( 2 @xmath40 ) that we have used in the foregoing discussion ( @xcite ) .",
    "any changes in our conclusions are expected to be minimal .",
    "the linear maser idealization is considered to be applicable because astrophysical masers ( especially the 22 ghz masers ) are thought to be highly elongated with very small beaming angles so that the rays are nearly parallel .",
    "the @xmath70 @xmath0  ster inferred above supports this premise for the masers of ",
    "we can not , of course , exclude the possibility that velocity and/or excitation gradients are present within the maser and have just the right variation to enhance the linewidth while maintaining a near - gaussian shape for the overall profile .",
    "it seems unlikely that a velocity gradient which is simply constant along the line of sight will do this .",
    "a velocity gradient will tend to flatten the peak and broaden the overall profile .",
    "when @xmath71 in figure  [ fkl ] , the peak of the profile already is more flat than a gaussian .",
    "a constant velocity gradient in this regime would only increase the deviation from a gaussian .",
    "when @xmath72 and the maser is unsaturated , a velocity gradient that is large enough to increase the linewidth significantly would be expected to cause excessive distortion in the line profle .",
    "the remaining possibility in a constant velocity gradient is that velocity relaxation is significant and that @xmath69 is greater than the rate for stimulated emission , which in turn is greater than @xmath14 .",
    "this would also correspond to the regime @xmath73 in figure  [ fkl ] .",
    "although the peak of the profile does not seem to be flattened in this case , the available calculations ( @xcite ) also suggest that the velocity gradient causes little increase in the linewidth  at least near the minimum for the linewidth in figure  [ fkl ] .",
    "our interpretation of the data in figure  [ fmp]would then be largely unchanged . further ,",
    "detailed calculations as a function of the relevant parameters are desirable , however .",
    "an analysis of the line strengths of the masing transitions of water at higher frequencies by @xcite  has indicated that these masers originate in a gas that is quite hot ( @xmath44 900 k ) .",
    "although 22 ghz h@xmath1o  masers do occur along the same lines of sight , the possibility that they are at different locations along those lines and might originate in gas at the lower temperatures could not be excluded .",
    "our interpretation of the gaussian nature of the 22 ghz profiles indicates that strong 22 ghz h@xmath1o  masers do originate in gas at similarly high temperatures .",
    "shock waves have long been recognized as likely environments for interstellar water masers ( @xcite ) .",
    "recent attention has been focussed on the specific properties of j - type shocks and c - type shocks . in the former",
    ", the 22 ghz masing has been found to originate in a relatively narrow range of temperatures near 400 k at which hydrogen molecules recombine .",
    "in contrast , 22 ghz masing at gas temperatures up to 3000 k and higher can occur in c - type shocks ( @xcite ) .",
    "evidently , our analysis is compatible with an origin for the masers in c - type shocks , but not j - type shocks .",
    "another implication of the relatively low degree of saturation of these masers is that the standard zeeman interpretation of their observed circular polarization ( @xcite ) is more likely to be valid ( @xcite )",
    ". clearly , more extensive observational efforts will be necessary to determine whether 22 ghz masers , and other masing species , commonly have near - gaussian spectral profiles which can be used as diagnostic tools ."
