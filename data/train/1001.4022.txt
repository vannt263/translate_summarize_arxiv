    "everywhere we look in nature and the modern world we find granular matter . from sands to soils , grains to powders , our understanding of granular systems has applications in diverse areas of both fundamental and applied science @xcite . in recent times , two key technologies that have been employed in attempting to gain a deep understanding of the properties of granular materials , namely , computational modelling using the discrete element method ( dem ) @xcite and direct 3d imaging of experimental systems using x - ray tomography ( xct ) @xcite . from xct",
    "we can obtain impressive experimental measurements of real physical systems , allowing us to measure the internal structural properties of a granular packing .",
    "however , some information such as frictional forces can not be retrieved from a pure geometrical characterization of the system structure . in this respect",
    ", dem offers the ability to fully characterise the system under consideration , allowing access to all its properties down to the forces on individual grains and at inter - grain contacts . here ,",
    "we combine these two technologies to obtain the best advantages of both worlds , considering real experimental granular systems from which we can also obtain all the additional information available to us from dem .    in our approach",
    ", we use a tomographic reconstruction of a real sphere packing as our starting point , and input this experimental data ( in the form of the coordinates of the sphere centers ) into our dem simulation @xcite . by this technique",
    "we can better characterize our experimental packing by removing the uncertainty in the exact locations of the sphere centers ( @xmath0 @xmath1 ) and also by removing the uncertainty in the exact diameters of the spheres caused by the polydispersity ( @xmath2  2% ) .",
    "we thus produce a simulated ideal mono - disperse sphere packing that almost exactly matches the grain positions of the original experimental packing . from such a ` virtual packing ' we can now compute with precision several static and dynamical properties which are otherwise not directly accessible from experiments .",
    "we use the aas database on disordered packings @xcite which contains structural data from experimental sphere packings obtained by x - ray computed tomography .",
    "we analyze 6 samples ( a - f ) composed of acrylic beads prepared in air within a cylindrical container with an inner diameter of @xmath3 and filled to a height of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "samples a and c contain @xmath5 beads with diameters @xmath6 and polydispersity within @xmath7 . whereas , samples b , d - f contain @xmath8 beads with diameters @xmath9 and polydispersity within @xmath7 .",
    "the two samples at lower packing fraction ( a , b ) were obtained by placing a stick in the middle of the container before pouring the beads and then slowly removing the stick @xcite .",
    "sample c was prepared by gently and slowly pouring the spheres into the container . whereas , sample d was obtained by a faster pouring . in sample",
    "e , a higher packing fraction was achieved by gently tapping the container walls . the densest sample ( f ) was obtained by a combined action of gentle tapping and compression from above ( with the upper surface left unconfined at the end of the preparation ) . to reduce boundary effects , the inside of the cylinder was roughened by randomly gluing spheres to the internal surface .",
    "the geometrical investigation of the packing structure was performed over a central region at 4 sphere - diameters away from the sample boundaries .",
    "the packing fraction of each of the samples is : a , @xmath10 ; b , @xmath11 ; c , @xmath12 ; d , @xmath13 ; e , @xmath14 ; and f , @xmath15 .",
    "we also analyze 12 samples ( fb12 - 24 and fb27 ) containing about 150,000 glass beads with diameters @xmath16 placed in a vertical polycarbonate tube with an inner diameter of 12.8 @xmath17 and a length of 230 @xmath17 .",
    "the packings were prepared in water by means of fluidized bed technique @xcite .",
    "packing fractions between 0.56 and 0.60 were obtained by using different flow rates . after each flow pulse , the particles sedimented forming a mechanically stable packing .",
    "packings created in this way are in a stationary state with packing fractions which are independent of the preparation history and have average values which depend on the flow rate , with smaller packing fractions for higher flow rates ( larger bed expansions ) .",
    "we use x - ray computed tomography ( xct ) to calculate the beads centers coordinates .",
    "this is done by applying over the three - dimensional xct density map a convolution method which is made algorithmically very efficient by using ( parallel ) fast fourier transform . furthermore a watershed method is also used to identify distinct grains .",
    "the resulting beads positions are estimated with a precision better than 0.1% of the beads diameters .",
    "this precision is well below the beads polydispersity which is between 1% and 3% considering both changes in the bead sizes and deviations from perfect sphericity .",
    "in order to eliminate the unavoidable experimental incertitudes on the bead positions , sizes and shapes we reconstruct a numerical sample by using the experimental coordinate and gently relaxing the system to perfect spherical beads .",
    "the resulting ` virtual packing ' has a geometrical structure that is almost identical to the experimental one . to this purpose",
    "we use dem simulations that integrate newton equation of motion for viscoelastic grains with rotational and translational degrees of freedom . in a typical process , grains interact during collision with non - linear forces and energy is continuously dissipated by inelastic collisions , by friction and by viscous damping .",
    "our simulations consider mono - disperse packings of elastofrictional spheres that interact with a normal repulsive force @xmath18 proportional to their overlap @xmath19 accordingly with the hertz s formula @xmath20 with @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the sphere - diameter and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the positions of the grain centers @xcite .",
    "this force only acts when grains overlap , with @xmath25 for @xmath26 . the spring constant @xmath27 is related to the physical properties of the grains , with : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is young s modulus and @xmath30 is poisson s ratio .",
    "we also consider tangential force @xmath31 under oblique loading using @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the displacement in the tangential direction that has taken place since the time @xmath34 when the two spheres first got in contact @xmath35 with @xmath36 is the relative shear velocity and @xmath37 is the kinematic friction coefficient between the spheres @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we include a normal viscoelastic dissipation @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the normal velocity , and a viscous friction force @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "the dem simulation is performed on a set of unfixed spheres in the central region of the sample , with the boundaries provided by the outer spheres which are kept fixed .",
    "the simulation uses realistic physical parameters with acrylic beads having : young modulus @xmath41 ; poisson ratio 0.3 ; density of @xmath42 ; inter grain static friction coefficient 0.28 .",
    "samples a , c have radius 0.5 mm whereas samples b , d , e , f have radius 0.795 mm .",
    "the glass beads have : young modulus @xmath43 , a poisson ratio 0.2 ; density of @xmath44 ; inter grain static friction coefficient 0.9 and radius 0.125 mm .",
    "figure [ f : height ] shows the variation in the average height of the grains as the simulation proceeds . typically during the dem relaxation",
    "there is initially a small expansion of the system , with the height increasing by a fraction of percent of the initial eight . the viscoelastic dissipation and viscous friction forces remove energy from the system until the spheres have all settled down to a stationary state .",
    "the final average height of the grains is within 0.1% - 0.2% of the initial average height and the average displacement of the centers of the spheres during the relaxation process is less than 5% of the sphere diameters .",
    "the relaxation is performed using large values of the the normal and tangential dissipation parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "this ensures a purely quasi - static relaxation , with the grains having during all the relaxation process an average number of contacts larger than 4 . essentially , the relaxation dynamics consists in a re - equilibration of the elastic stress trapped in the grain overlaps in the initial configurations which are unphysical and unbalanced due to the experimental uncertainties on the grain positions , polydispersity and a - sphericity .",
    ".[t.1 ] details for the fluidized bed in the internal region of the dem relaxed samples : number of internal mobile spheres ( n ) , packing fraction ( @xmath47 ) , average number of neighbors ( @xmath48 ) , fraction of contacts that can not hold extra tangential force ( @xmath49 ) , prediction for the isostatic condition from eq.[iso ] ( @xmath50 ) , critical size ( @xmath51 ) in units of @xmath22 .",

    "in this work we presented results obtained from a newly developed ` virtual laboratory ' platform which combines direct experimental imagining data from xct with dem simulation tools .",
    "we have shown that such a combination is very powerful providing virtual samples which are geometrically identical to the experimental ones but allow us to access to physical information that would not be obtainable from experiments alone .",
    "for instance , we have been able to greatly improve our estimate of the number of grains in contact and to study accurately the region of near contacts . in particular",
    ", we pointed out that the exponential law for the growth in the number of near neighbors with the radial distance is well followed across all samples but the exponent is not universal varying from @xmath52 at low packing fractions to @xmath53 for the densest sample at @xmath54 .",
    "we have discussed how close our packings are to isostaticity and how a critical size of around ten grain diameters emerges as minimal mechanically - stable cluster .",
    "the relation between average number of contacts and packing fraction has been investigated both globally and locally and it has been compared with analytical predictions . the distribution of the number of contact per grain has been investigated and we introduced a simple meaningful model based on free ` particles ' sharing the solid angle around a sphere which turns out to reproduce remarkably well the observed distributions . we have been able to access the complete set of forces on each individual grain and we have shown that the normal forces well follow an exponential distribution .",
    "we measured the local pressure on each voronoi cell and we uncover a liner relation between the sum of the normal forces and the number of contacts on each bead . in future work",
    ", we will further examine the dynamic properties of packings , considering the system under external loadings and under shear , combining high speed tomography and other bulk imaging techniques with dem during dense granular flow and at the jamming transition .",
    "the role of grain shape in granular systems is also of great interest @xcite and an extension of this technique to consider three - dimensional non - spherical grains will also be pursued .",
