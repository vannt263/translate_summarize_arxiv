    "while there is a generally accepted framework for how single stars form , the manner in which binary and high - order multiple stars form remains contentious . yet , the formation of such systems , rather than of single stars , constitutes the primary mode by which the majority of stars having masses comparable to and higher than that of the sun form . at the present time , the debate on how binary ( hereafter , used generically to also include higher - order multiple ) stars form are focussed on two primary issues : ( i ) what mechanism(s ) create the seeds for a binary system , and when are these seeds produced during the collapse of a gravitationally - bound condensation ( core ) ; and ( ii ) what factors determine the growth of the individual protostellar components to reach their final , often different , masses .",
    "knowledge of the ingredients involved in defining the individual masses of binary components is critical for addressing another outstanding question in star formation , the origin of the stellar initial mass function .",
    "historically , a number of pathways have been proposed for the formation of binary stars : fission , capture , and fragmentation ( e.g. , review by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "numerical simulations show that rotational instabilities in self - gravitating spheroids do not lead to fission ",
    "splitting into two ( equal ) pieces .",
    "instead , the spheroid develops a central bar and spiral arms , the latter of which transport both angular momentum and mass outwards to stabilize the structure against fission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "capture as a result of a close encounter between single protostars is energetically unfavourable , even when large and massive circumstellar disks are invoked to help absorb the impact energy @xcite .",
    "encounters typically result in flybys , with each flyby partially disrupting the disk and reducing its ability to absorb the impact energy of the next encounter . recently",
    ", gravitational instabilities in circumstellar disks have been invoked to form relatively low - mass binary companions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "given the large range in mass ratios exhibited by binary systems , however , this process can constitute , at best , a minor pathway for the formation of binary stars .    in part therefore by a process of elimination , fragmentation  the internal break - up of a core into two or more pieces  has emerged as the leading contender for how the majority of binary stars form ( e.g. , review by * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "two different mechanisms have been proposed to drive fragmentation : ( i ) bulk ( large - scale ordered ) rotation ; and ( ii ) local ( small - scale ) turbulence .",
    "as described in more detail in @xmath1 , depending on the actual circumstances involved , these two mechanisms can predict very different geometries and dynamics for the resulting binary system : i.e. , alignment between circumstellar disks and/or spin axes of the binary components , as well as alignment between circumstellar disks and orbital plane or between the spin and orbital axes .",
    "comparisons between binary properties and model predictions for their formation , however , are complicated by possible internal or external interactions during or after the protostellar phase .",
    "depending on the nature of the interaction , the binary system can be driven either towards or away from alignment , altering its original geometry and dynamics thus masking its formation process . as we shall demonstrate in this manuscript , a more promising approach to distinguish between different fragmentation models",
    "is to study binary systems in the process of formation . still embedded in their parental cores ,",
    "the different proposed drivers of fragmentation make very different predictions for the geometrical and dynamical relationship between the resulting protostellar binaries and their surrounding envelopes ( see @xmath1 ) . in this manuscript , incorporating new data having a significantly improved angular resolution and sensitivity , we accurately deduce the alignment between the circumstellar disks , as well as between the circumstellar disks and surrounding envelope , of a binary protostellar system , the classi object l1551irs5 .",
    "furthermore , we thoroughly explore best - fit orbits to measurements of relative proper motion for the binary protostars , thus deducing the alignment between the orbital plane and the circumstellar disks . from the geometrical and dynamical relationship between the binary system and its parental core , we reason that the physical properties of l1551irs5 reflect the manner in which it formed rather than being imposed by subsequent interactions . as a consequence",
    ", its physical properties can be directly used to differentiate between different mechanisms that drove the fragmentation of its parental core .",
    "the work reported in this manuscript lays the foundation for theoretical simulations on how the binary components in l1551irs5 are interacting with and accreting from their envelope , motivating planned observations of this system with the atacama large millimeter and submillimeter array ( alma ) .",
    "we recently conducted such a theoretical simulation for the classi object l1551ne , assuming a circular coplanar orbit for the binary protostars as well as a coplanar circumbinary disk .",
    "we found the model predictions to be in good agreement with the observed structure and kinematics of its circumbinary disk as measured with alma @xcite .",
    "this manuscript is arranged as follows . in @xmath2 , we describe our most recent observation of the circumstellar disks of the binary protostars in l1551irs5 , surpassing in both sensitivity and angular resolution previous observations .",
    "the results are presented in @xmath3 , along with an explanation of how we separated the ionized jets from the circumstellar dust disks . in @xmath4 , we describe how we determine the inclinations , relative alignments , and sizes of the binary circumstellar disks . in @xmath5 , we describe how we determine the geometry of their surrounding envelope , how this geometry relates to that of the circumstellar disks , and place constraints on a central cavity in the envelope . in @xmath6 , we present all currently available measurements for the relative proper motion of the binary protostars , acceptable best - fit orbits to these measurements , and constraints placed on the orbits by the sizes of the circumstellar disks and tentative upper limits on the size of any central cavity . in @xmath7 , we bring together all the aforementioned properties of l1551irs5 to assemble a coherent picture for how this system formed .",
    "we also extrapolate into the future the likely evolution of l1551irs5 , and how its projected properties on the main sequence will compare with those of other binary systems having similar masses and orbital separations . in @xmath8 , we provide a thorough summary of our results , analyses , and interpretation . throughout this manuscript",
    ", we assume a distance to l1551irs5 of 140pc .",
    "we observed l1551irs5 using the jansky very large array ( vla ) on 2012 november 16 , 28 , and 29 , spanning a duration of @xmath02.5hr on each day .",
    "the correlator was configured to provide a bandwidth of 8ghz over the frequency range 3947ghz ( central wavelength of @xmath07 mm ) . to mitigate against rapid changes in absorption and refraction by the earth s atmosphere ,",
    "causing rapid fluctuations in the measured visibility amplitude and phase of the target source , we switched between observations of l1551irs5 and a nearby secondary calibrator , the quasar j0431@xmath91731 , every 20s . as a check of the quality of the amplitude and phase corrections",
    ", we performed similar observations of a quasar lying close to l1551irs5 , j0431@xmath92037 , every @xmath030mins .",
    "this quasar also was used to check the pointing accuracy of the antennas , a task performed every @xmath01hr .",
    "the bright quasar j0510 + 1800 served as the bandpass calibrator , and the quasar 3c48 as the flux calibrator .",
    "we edited , calibrated , and made maps from the data using the common astronomy software applications ( casa ) package .",
    "considerable effort went into weeding out radio - frequency interference ( rfi ) , which can be very weak and difficult to find , to ensure that the actual data used for making the maps is as free of contamination as is possible .",
    "the calibration was performed in the standard manner ( e.g. , examples in https://casaguides.nrao.edu/index.php/karl_g._jansky_vla_tutorials ) as recommended by the observatory .",
    "maps were made using two different weighting schemes , natural ( i.e. , equal weights on all visibilities ) and @xmath10 ( unequal weights designed to provide a more uniform sampling in @xmath11-space ) , to accentuate different features of interest .",
    "the synthesized beams and root - mean - square ( rms ) noise fluctuations ( @xmath12 ) of the maps thus made are summarised in table[map parameters ] .",
    "notice that the synthesized beams obtained using the two weighting schemes are close to circular , making it easier to visually interpret as well as analyze the maps .",
    "all subsequent analyses of the images obtained were made using the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) and galfit software packages .",
    "figure[l1551irs5 image natural](@xmath13 ) ( color map , along with contours plotted at varying intervals of @xmath12 ) and figure[l1551irs5 image natural](@xmath14 ) ( same color map , along with contours now plotted at uniformly spaced percentage levels of the peak intensity ) show the map obtained for l1551irs5 using natural weighting , yielding an angular resolution of @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "two sources are apparent , separated by @xmath17 and aligned almost exactly along the north - south direction .",
    "we shall henceforth refer to the more northerly source as the n source , and the more southerly source as the s source .",
    "both sources are clearly elongated along the north - west to south - east directions .",
    "in addition , relatively weak protrusions can been seen extending away from each source towards the north - east and south - west , oriented in approximately the same directions as a pair of ionized jets imaged at 3.5 cm with the vla by @xcite .",
    "@xcite infer a position angle of @xmath18 for the northern and @xmath19 for the southern jet , as indicated by the arrows in figure[l1551irs5 image natural]@xmath13 .",
    "notice that the protrusion on the south - western side of the s source lies northwards of the inferred jet axis for this component .",
    "the same offset also is apparent for this part of the jet in its image at 3.5 cm as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "finally , even weaker protrusions can be seen on the northern and south - eastern sides of the s source , and perhaps ( at close to marginal significance ) also on the northern and southern sides of the n source .",
    "figure[l1551irs5 image robust](@xmath13 ) ( color map , along with contours plotted at varying intervals of @xmath12 ) and figure[l1551irs5 image robust](@xmath14 ) ( same color map , along with contours now plotted at uniformly spaced percentage levels of the peak intensity ) show the map obtained using robust weighting , providing nearly a factor of two higher angular resolution of @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) but a factor of about three poorer sensitivity . apart from the strongest protrusion on the north - eastern side of the s source ( related to its jet ) ,",
    "all the other protrusions seen in the naturally - weighted map are not detectable in the robust - weighted map .",
    "as before , both sources are clearly elongated along the north - west to south - east directions . at or close to their centers , both sources appear to be elongated also along the north - east to south - west directions , quite closely aligned with the inferred orientations of their ionized jets .    in our previous observation of l1551irs5 at 7 mm with the vla ( before its upgrade )",
    ", we attained a far inferior sensitivity , along with a somewhat poorer angular resolution despite utilizing the pie town antenna as part of the array @xcite . in that observation",
    ", we detected a relatively compact feature at a 5@xmath12 significance level southeast of the n source . in the observation reported here ,",
    "apart from the n and s sources , we detect no other source in our field of view ( extending far beyond the binary system to a full - width half - maximum of 1 ) .",
    "although we can not rule out a transient source , it seems more likely that the weak and relatively compact feature detected in our previous observation is an artefact produced by the poorer quality of the calibration possible at the time ( compared with the case here where , because of the much higher instantaneous sensitivity , corrections for variations in atmospheric phase can be made on much shorter timescales and at a much higher precision ) .",
    "[ decomposing ] as pointed out by @xcite , at 7 mm the emission from the binary components in l1551irs5 is dominated by dust from their circumstellar disks . when observed at a sufficiently high sensitivity ,",
    "however , free - free emission from their ionized jets also is detectable at 7 mm , as found by @xcite and as is clearly apparent in figure[l1551irs5 image natural](@xmath13 ) and to a lesser extent also figure[l1551irs5 image robust](@xmath13 ) . to determine the geometry of the circumstellar disks , one of the main goals of this work",
    ", we therefore have to remove the contributions from the ionized jets .    as can be seen in , especially , the naturally - weighted map of figure[l1551irs5 image natural](@xmath13 ) ,",
    "the ionized jets from both protostars have a complicated structure .",
    "fortunately , to separate the ionized jets from the circumstellar disks , we only have to subtract the portion of the jet projected against each circumstellar disk rather than the entire jet structure .",
    "as we shall show , a two - component 2-dimensional gaussian function fitted simultaneously to each source provides an adequate decomposition of the projected portions of the jets from the respective circumstellar disks .",
    "the parameters of the dual gaussian components that provide the best fit to each source in the natural- and robust - weighted maps separately are listed in table[fitting parameters ] .",
    "these components , convolved with the corresponding synthesized beams ( also two - dimensional gaussian functions with parameters as listed in table[map parameters ] ) , are plotted in contours in figures[l1551irs5 image natural](@xmath22 ) and [ l1551irs5 image robust](@xmath22 ) , overlaid on the color maps of figures[l1551irs5 image natural](@xmath13 ) and [ l1551irs5 image robust](@xmath13 ) respectively . to provide a simple visual comparison of the relative sizes of the gaussian components fitted to each source , the contour levels for each gaussian component are plotted at the same percentage levels of the peak intensity of that component . as can be seen , for each source , one of the fitted gaussian components has its major axis closely aligned with the inferred orientation of the jet from that source ( indicated by the arrows in figures[l1551irs5 image natural](@xmath13 ) and [ l1551irs5 image robust](@xmath13 ) ) , and must therefore correspond to the inner portion of the jet .",
    "the other component has its major axis closely orthogonal to the inferred jet orientation , and must therefore correspond to the circumstellar disk .",
    "the residuals after subtracting the two - component , two - dimensional gaussian components fitted to each source are shown in contours in figure[l1551irs5 image natural](@xmath23 ) for the natural- and figure[l1551irs5 image robust](@xmath23 ) for the robust - weighted map , again overlaid on the color maps of figures[l1551irs5 image natural](@xmath13 ) and [ l1551irs5 image robust](@xmath13 ) respectively .",
    "although significant residuals ( @xmath24@xmath25 and/or @xmath26@xmath27 ) are apparent in figure[l1551irs5 image natural](@xmath23 ) , these residuals coincide primarily with protrusions outside the main bodies  and therefore also circumstellar disks  of the n and s sources . within the main bodies of the two sources ,",
    "all the residuals are @xmath28 .",
    "thus , in the naturally - weighted maps , the fitted gaussian components provide a reasonably good decomposition of the projected portions of the jets from the circumstellar disks . in figure[l1551irs5 image robust](@xmath23 ) , the only significant residual ( @xmath29 ) is that at the centroid of the s source .",
    "thus , in the uniformly - weighted maps , the fitted gaussian components provide an excellent decomposition of the projected portions of the jets from the circumstellar disks . subtracting",
    "the gaussian components fitted to the jets leave the jet - subtracted images of the n and s sources shown in figure[nuker ] ( first column ) , used in @xmath4 for determining the physical parameters of the circumstellar disks . as a simple demonstration of the need to subtract the jets so as to obtain a good fit for the circumstellar disks , in figures[l1551irs5 image natural](@xmath30 ) and [ l1551irs5 image robust](@xmath30 ) we plot in contours just a single 2-dimensional gaussian function fitted to each of the two sources . once again",
    ", these gaussian components are plotted at the same percentage levels of their individual peak intensities . to provide a simple visual comparison of how well these components actually match the main bodies of the n and s sources , in figures[l1551irs5 image natural](@xmath14 ) and [ l1551irs5 image robust](@xmath14 ) we plot contour levels for the two sources at the same percentage levels of their individual peak intensities . as can be seen ,",
    "there are clear differences between the fitted and observed structures in the central region of the n source as well as the north - eastern side of the s source .",
    "these differences correspond to the projected portions of the jets captured in the two - component fit to each source as described above .",
    "the same differences appear as relatively strong residuals in figures[l1551irs5 image natural](@xmath31 ) and [ l1551irs5 image robust](@xmath31 ) after subtracting the single gaussian component fitted to each source . as listed in table[fitting parameters ] , both the peak and integrated intensities of the gaussian components fitted to the circumstellar disks are higher ( by up to an order of magnitude ) than those fitted to their corresponding ionized jets .",
    "thus , at 7 mm , emission from the circumstellar disks dominate over that from the jets projected closely against these disks , consistent with that found previously .",
    "furthermore , the centroids of the gaussian components fitted to the circumstellar disks coincide with their respective source centroids . by contrast",
    ", the centroids of the gaussian components fitted to the jets are clearly displaced from their respective source centroids in the natural- and , for the s source , also the robust - weighted maps .",
    "finally , the circumstellar disks are resolved along their minor as well as major axes in both the natural- and robust - weighted maps . by contrast ,",
    "only the southern jet is resolved along both its major and minor axes , and then only in the natural - weighted map .",
    "at the spatial resolutions so far attained in observations of protostars , it is not possible to uniquely constrain the radial intensity profiles of their circumstellar disks .",
    "for example , as shown in @xmath32 , a two - dimensional gaussian function provides a good fit to the image of each of the two circumstellar disks in l1551irs5 .",
    "circumstellar disks , however , are unlikely to have gaussian radial intensity profiles . instead",
    ", images of the circumstellar dust disks of protostars are usually fitted with physically motivated models for their radial intensity profiles .    for single protostars ,",
    "a power - law radial surface brightness distribution is commonly assumed for their circumstellar dust disks .",
    "this brightness profile is designed to mimic disks that have power - law surface density and temperature profiles ( e.g. , see brief review by * ? ? ?",
    "in such models , the disk is usually truncated at an inner radius that reflects either its innermost physical extent or that within which dust sublimates ( but gas is present ) , as well as at an outer radius that reflects its outermost physical extent .",
    "the outer disk radius derived in such models depends on the value inferred or chosen for its inner radius . in pre - main - sequence stars ,",
    "the inner radius of the dust disk can be inferred by modelling its spectral energy distribution at near- to mid - infrared wavelengths .",
    "this approach , however , is not possible for protostars , which are obscured by their optically - thick envelopes at near- to mid - infrared wavelengths . to further complicate matters , models that invoke a sharply truncated outer edge have been found to yield an outer radius for the dust component significantly smaller than that seen in scattered light or the outer radius for the gaseous ( as traced in co ) component ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "instead , @xcite find that models in which the disk tapers off gradually at its edge can better reproduce , simultaneously , the emission observed from both the dust and gas components .",
    "by contrast with single protostars , the circumstellar disks of closely - separated binary protostars are predicted to be truncated by tidal interactions with their companions and therefore have sharp edges .",
    "as shown by @xcite , tidal forces exerted by one protostar induce elliptical orbits in the circumstellar disk of the other protostar . because the orbital eccentricity generally increases with distance from the protostar , outer orbits eventually intersect with inner orbits .",
    "in this situation , the largest non - intersecting orbit defines the outermost stable orbit and hence maximal possible extent of a circumstellar disk .",
    "motivated by this prediction , we have fitted a two - component power - law radial brightness profile to the circumstellar disks of the n and s sources , where the much steeper outer power - law represents the rapid tapering of the disks at their edges . to permit a smooth transition between the two power laws ( which we deem to be more physical ) , we fitted a profile known as the nuker function @xcite , examples of which are shown in figure[nuker ] ( last column ) .",
    "this function is parameterised as : @xmath33^{\\gamma-\\beta \\over \\alpha } \\ \\ \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the intensity , @xmath35 , as a function of radius , @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the inner power - law slope , @xmath38 the outer power - law slope , @xmath39 controls the sharpness of the transition between the two power laws ( larger @xmath39 indicating a sharper transition ) , @xmath40 the break radius at which the slope is the average of @xmath38 and @xmath37 or , equivalently , the radius of maximum curvature in logarithmic units , and @xmath41 the intensity at @xmath40 .",
    "we fitted two - dimensional nuker functions to the jet - subtracted images of the n and s sources shown in figure[nuker ] ( first column ) using the software package galfit .",
    "this package was originally developed by @xcite , and its latest incarnation is described by @xcite . for the natural - weighted map of the n source shown in figure[nuker ] ( upper row ) , we had to tightly restrict the region fitted to an area that just encompasses the main body of this source .",
    "no such restriction was necessary for the naturally - weighted map of the s source shown in figure[nuker ] ( middle row ) or the robust - weighted map of the n source shown in figure[nuker ] ( bottom row ) , where the jet - related emission outside the main body of each source is relatively weak and do not significant affect the fits .",
    "sensibly , the galfit program does not try to fit for the ( spatially unresolved ) central region of the circumstellar disk within an area spanned by the fwhm of the synthesized beam .",
    "the results of the fits ( the program returns parameters for the lowest @xmath42 ) therefore do not depend on the presence of any central clearing in the circumstellar disk , and makes no statement about the radial brightness profile within this central area .",
    "for completeness , we note that a single power - law ( i.e. , setting @xmath43 ) does not provide satisfactory fits to either circumstellar disks .",
    "leaving all parameters in the nuker function to be freely fitted , the galfit program was not able to find satisfactory fits for either circumstellar disks .",
    "on the other hand , by fixing @xmath39 ( which determines the sharpness of the transition between the inner and outer power - law ) at different values , we found that the position angle of the major axis and inclination ( as determined from the ratio of the minor to major axes ) of both circumstellar disks to be essentially constant independent of @xmath39 in both the natural- and robust - weighted maps .",
    "furthermore , these parameters are similar to those derived by fitting a two - dimensional gaussian function to each circumstellar disk ( to within the uncertainties of the gaussian fits , as listed in table[fitting parameters ] ) . evidently , although the radial intensity profiles of the circumstellar disks can not be uniquely constrained , their position angles and inclinations are well determined .",
    "we therefore fixed these parameters at their formal values derived from the gaussian fits .",
    "when deriving their inclinations , we assumed implicitly that both circumstellar disks have circularly symmetric radial intensity profiles and are geometrically thin ( i.e. , vertical thickness much smaller than the disk diameter ) .",
    "@xcite show that the radius at which orbits in the circumstellar disks significantly depart from near circular only occurs beyond about 80% of their tidally - truncated radius .",
    "the gaussian functions fitted to the circumstellar disks have radii at fwhm ( the dimemsions used to infer the disk inclinations ) that are only about 60%70% of their break radii found by fitting nuker functions ( @xmath44 ) . as a consequence",
    ", tidal distortions should not significantly affect the inclinations we infer for the circumstellar disks .",
    "more problematically , if the circumstellar disks are strongly flared , then their inclinations may be underestimated .",
    "vertical settling of dust to the midplane , if it occurs , can mitigate this problem for disks traced in dust emission , as is the case here .",
    "as we will show in @xmath45 , the inferred inclinations of both circumstellar disks are systematically lower than the inclination of the orbital plane for many of the best - fit acceptable orbits , which span a wide range of eccentricities .",
    "the possibility that the circumstellar disks are strongly flared and hence their inclinations underestimated may explain their apparent misalignment with the orbital plane",
    ". on the other hand , as we show in @xmath46 , both circumstellar disks are closely parallel with their surrounding flattened envelope , arguing against a large systematic error in their inferred inclinations .",
    "as listed in table[fitting parameters ] , whether derived from the natural- or robust - weighted maps , the position angles of both circumstellar disks are identical to within the measurement uncertainties . from the natural - weighted map ,",
    "the position angle is @xmath47 for the circumstellar disk of the n source and @xmath48 for the circumstellar disk of the s source , similar to within @xmath49 .",
    "the uncertainties in the position angles are larger in the robust - weighted maps , where the position angles of the two circumstellar disks are similar to within @xmath50 .",
    "the inclination of each circumstellar disk as derived from the natural- and robust - weighted maps also is similar to within the measurement uncertainties , although there is a small difference between the inclinations of the two disks in both these maps . in the naturally - weighted map",
    ", the circumstellar disk of the n source has an inclination of @xmath51 and that for the s source an inclination of @xmath52 , a difference of just @xmath53 .",
    "the uncertainties in the inclinations are larger in the robust - weighted maps , where the inclinations of the two circumstellar disks differ by @xmath54 .",
    "henceforth , we shall adopt the position angles and inclinations obtained from the natural - weighted map , where the uncertainties in both these parameters are significantly smaller than those obtained from the robust - weighted maps ; this map has a higher sensitivity than the robust - weighted map , and hence samples a larger extent of the circumstellar disks .",
    "_ the circumstellar disks of the binary protostars in l1551irs5 are therefore very closely parallel _ , providing the first of several constraints that we will impose on models for the formation of this binary system .    in binary systems such as l1551irs5",
    "where ionized jets can be traced far beyond the circumstellar disks , the alignment between the jets as projected onto the sky plane can potentially serve as a sensitive probe of the alignment between the circumstellar disks . as mentioned earlier , from a high angular - resolution map at 3.6 cm where there is no apparent emission from the circumstellar disks , @xcite infer a position angle of @xmath18 for the northern and @xmath19 for the southern jet . if the jets emerge perpendicular to their respective circumstellar disks , then the major axes of the two circumstellar disks should have positions angles that differ by @xmath55 . instead , we find that the major axes of the two circumstellar disks are aligned to within @xmath49 .",
    "as we will now show , the orientations that @xcite infer for the two jets may differ from the true orientations at their bases . at 3.6 cm , both jets in l1551 irs5 are detected as a series of knots .",
    "the knots are not aligned along a single axis for either the northern or southern jets . as a consequence , to infer the position angles of the individual jets , @xcite fitted a two - dimensional gaussian function to the knot closest to the individual protostellar components ( the latter defined by the centroids of their circumstellar disks as measured by * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the knots that @xcite selected are the same as those fitted by the gaussian components corresponding to the jet of the n source in figure[l1551irs5 image natural]@xmath22 and the jet of the s source in figure[l1551irs5 image natural]@xmath22 and [ l1551irs5 image robust]@xmath22 . as can be seen even in the map at 3.6 cm presented by @xcite , the centroid of the knot closest to the s source",
    "is visibly displaced to the north - east of this source .",
    "we see the same displacement at 7 mm in both figures[l1551irs5 image natural]@xmath22 and [ l1551irs5 image robust]@xmath22 , confirming that this knot does not trace the base of the southern jet . in the map at 3.6 cm presented by @xcite , the centroid of the knot closest to the n source appears to coincide with this source . at the higher angular resolution of our natural - weighted map at 7 mm ( figure[l1551irs5 image natural]@xmath22 ) ,",
    "however , the centroid of this knot can be seen to be displaced to the south - west of the n source .",
    "thus , this knot does not actually trace the base of the northern jet . from our naturally - weighted map at 7 mm ( figure[l1551irs5 image natural]@xmath22 )",
    ", we infer a position angle of @xmath56 for the northern and @xmath57 for the southern jet ( table[fitting parameters ] ) based on the same knots as those used by @xcite .",
    "these values are significantly different ( by @xmath58 for the northern and @xmath59 for the southern jet ) from those determined by @xcite at a lower angular resolution at 3.6 cm .",
    "figure[ionized jets ] shows the structure of the knots closest to the n and s sources after the gaussian components fitted to their circumstellar disks have been subtracted from the natural - weighted map of figure[l1551irs5 image natural ] . evidently , the knot closest to the s source has a complicated structure .",
    "indeed , this knot is resolved not only along its major but also its minor axes ; thus , the two - dimensional intensity distribution of this knot affects the position angle inferred for its major axis .",
    "the same also is true for this knot at 3.6 cm , where it is resolved along both its major and minor axes ( see table1 of * ? ? ?",
    "thus , in l1551irs5 , where the knots defining either of the two jets do not lie along a single axis and the knot closest to each protostar does not actually trace the base of the jet , we caution against using the apparent misalignment between the jets to infer a corresponding misalignment between their associated circumstellar disks .",
    "fixing the position angles and inclinations of the circumstellar disks to the values listed in table[nuker ] ( their formal values as derived from gaussian fits to the n and s sources and listed in table[fitting parameters ] ) , we then varied the value of @xmath39 to investigate how the remaining free parameters changed with @xmath39 .",
    "for the jet - subtracted image of the n source , we found that the solutions converge to a common set of values for @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 as @xmath39 increases ( i.e. , sharper transition between the inner and outer power - laws ) .",

    "one or both effects can extend the circumbinary disk inwards as far as its centrifugal radius ( if any ) , where gravitational and centrifugal forces are balanced . even if there is a central clearing in the circumbinary disk , material is predicted to penetrate into this clearing through the outer lagrangian points of the binary system to accrete onto the circumstellar disks . as a consequence ,",
    "any central clearing in the circumbinary disk is , at least sporadically , not entirely devoid of matter .",
    "as mentioned in @xmath5 , the envelope is inferred to transition to a rotationally - supported circumbinary disk ( i.e. , exhibiting keplerian motion ) at a radius of @xmath0046 ( projected radius of @xmath064au ) . from a keplerian fit to the spatial - kinematic structure of the circumbinary disk , @xcite infer a binary mass of @xmath0@xmath124 .",
    "such a binary mass rules out orbits having eccentricities @xmath125 in family b , and constrains the orbital period to the range @xmath0200 - 2000yrs or narrower in family a.",
    "we begin by summarizing the constraints imposed on models for the formation of l1551irs5 as derived in @xmath4@xmath6 . from the measured geometry of its circumstellar disks and its surrounding envelope :    * the circumstellar disks of the binary protostars are very closely parallel * the circumstellar disks also are very closely parallel to their surrounding flattened envelope    based on the measured relative proper motion of the binary protostars and published measurements of the kinematics of its surrounding envelope :    * the orbital motion is in the same direction as the rotational motion of the surrounding envelope    the close geometrical and dynamical relationship between the circumstellar disks and surrounding flattened envelope suggests that the angular momentum of material that gave rise to the protostellar system and that comprising its parental core are aligned .    finally , although orbits spanning a wide range of eccentricities provide acceptable fits to the available measurements of the relative proper motion for the binary protostars in l1551irs5 , theoretical predictions for limits in the sizes of the circumstellar disks as imposed by tidal truncation rule out the vast majority of best - fit orbits having moderate eccentricites ( @xmath126 ) and all best fit orbits having high eccentricities ( @xmath127 ) . for the remaining best - fit orbits :    * in the majority of cases ,",
    "there is a systematic tilt ( by up to typically @xmath025 ) between the circumstellar disks and the binary orbital plane ; nevertheless , there is a clear preference for a relatively close alignment if not coplanarity      as explained in @xmath128 , current models invoke either local ( small - scale ) turbulence in or the bulk rotation of cores to drive fragmentation . in cores that have little or no bulk rotation ,",
    "turbulence introduces velocity and density inhomogeneities that can seed and drive the growth of multiple density perturbations to become self gravitating ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thereafter , dynamical interactions between the fragments can play an important role in determining the final properties of the binary system ( e.g. , number and masses of component stars , together with their orbital separation and eccentricity ) .",
    "multiple fragments produced in different turbulent cells are predicted to exhibit random orientations between the circumstellar disks or spin axes of the binary components , and no particular relationship between the circumstellar disks and orbital plane or the spin and orbital axes . if multiple fragments are produced in a common region where turbulence conspires to create local angular momentum , however , the binary system thus assembled can exhibit quite well aligned circumstellar disks and orbital plane or spin and orbital axes . rather than through turbulence , the large - scale ordered rotation of the core also can drive dynamical instabilities to induce fragmentation during collapse .",
    "in such models , conservation of angular momentum forces cores to become increasingly flattened as they collapse . as a result , a disequilibrium disk - like ( i.e. , flattened and rotating ) structure forms at the center of the core .",
    "the central region of the core can become especially flattened if magnetic fields are invoked to direct infalling matter onto the mid - plane of the disk - like structure ; the resulting structures closely resemble , at least morphologically , rotationally - supported disks , and are therefore referred to as pseudodisks @xcite . by introducing an initial density or velocity perturbation , the large - scale ordered rotation of the core can drive dynamical instabilities in the form of a spiral , bar , or ring in its central flattened region @xcite .",
    "the pattern of the dynamical instability does not depend on the nature of the initial velocity or density perturbations .",
    "furthermore , because the perturbations introduced can either promote or hinder fragmentation , in the latter case through the effective removal of angular momentum by gravitational torques from the resulting dynamical instability , increasing the amplitude of the initial perturbation does not necessarily increase the likelihood of fragmentation .",
    "fragments form in localised regions of the resulting dynamical instabilities that are gravitationally unstable ( according to the toomre criterion ) and have masses exceeding the local jeans mass .",
    "theoretical considerations suggest that , when driven by the large - scale ordered rotation of the core , fragmentation most likely occurs during the adiabatic phase ( when a first hydrostatic core forms and grows ) or the protostellar phase ( see arguments in * ? ? ?",
    "binaries that form through the rotation fragmentation of disk - like structures should naturally exhibit a close alignment between the spin axes of the component stars .",
    "because fragments can be produced at different heights from and perhaps even on opposite sides of the mid - plane , however , the circumstellar disks and orbital planes of the resulting binary system need not be closely aligned but can span a range of angles .",
    "the mass ratio and orbital parameters ( i.e. , orbital separation and eccentricity ) of such binary systems depend not only on the initial mass ratios and orbits of their parental fragments , but also how these fragments interact with each other ( especially in systems initially comprising three or more fragments ) as well as with the surrounding material from which they accrete .",
    "as explained above , both turbulent- and rotationally - driven fragmentation can produce binary systems in which the circumstellar disks are parallel with each other , as well as quite closely parallel if not coplanar with the binary orbit , satisfying some of the observed physical properties of l1551irs5 .",
    "the crucial distinction between the two fragmentation models , however , is the physical relationship between the binary system and its surrounding bulk envelope , constituting the remnant parental core . in models that invoke turbulent fragmentation , even in the situation where multiple fragments are produced in a common region where turbulence conspires to create local angular momentum ( and",
    "thus produce an aligned binary system ) , the binary system need not orbit in the same direction as the rotation of the bulk envelope , let alone have circumstellar disks aligned with any flattening of the bulk envelope . on the other hand , in models that invoke rotational fragmentation , the binary system will of course orbit in the same direction as the rotation of its surrounding envelope , and its circumstellar disks aligned with the surrounding flattened envelope . the observed physical properties of l1551irs5 therefore directly point to its formation through rotational fragmentation . in support of this argument",
    ", both the measured rotational velocity and the high degree of flattening exhibited by the envelope around l1551irs5 suggest that its parental core possessed considerable angular momentum .",
    "as mentioned above , even when formed by rotational fragmentation , the circumstellar disks of the resulting binary protostars , although parallel with each other , need not be accurately aligned with the orbital plane .",
    "@xcite argue that tidal interactions can quite rapidly align the circumstellar disks of binary protostars with their orbital planes , such that low - mass binary protostellar systems with orbital separations @xmath129au should have coplanar disks and orbital planes .",
    "if this process had indeed driven the circumstellar disks of l1551irs5 towards close alignment with the binary orbital plane , the same process would have led to a misalignment between the circumstellar disks / orbital plane and the surrounding flattened envelope .",
    "consider the situation where the two protostars formed at different heights from , and perhaps even on opposite sides of , the midplane of a flattened core , as shown in the schematic diagram of figure[fragmentation](@xmath13 ) . at birth , the circumstellar disks of the two protostars are therefore closely parallel with their surrounding flattened envelope , but not coplanar with each other or the orbital plane .",
    "if the circumstellar disks are then brought into alignment with the orbital plane by tidal interactions , the mutual plane of the binary system now becomes misaligned with the surrounding flattened envelope , as shown in figure[fragmentation](@xmath22 ) .",
    "by contrast , we find that the circumstellar disks of l1551irs5 are very closely parallel to their surrounding flattened envelope , but probably misaligned by up to typically @xmath025  from the orbital plane , a geometry more akin to that shown in figure[fragmentation](@xmath13 ) .",
    "the probable misalignment between the circumstellar disks / flattened envelope and the binary orbital plane may therefore reflect the formation of the binary fragments in different planes sharing the same rotational axis . by imposing the condition that the inferred break radii of the circumstellar disks can not be larger than their theoretically predicted tidally - truncated radii , only a very narrow range of orbital periods , if any , are permitted for the best - fit orbits having eccentricities @xmath130 , as explained in @xmath93 .",
    "thus , most probably , l1551irs5 has a circular or low - eccentricity orbit .",
    "early in the protostellar and perhaps even first core phase when fragmentation occurs , the fragments have a very low mass compared with their surrounding envelope ( parental core ) . in the situation",
    "where , at apastron , the orbital velocity of the fragments is smaller than the rotational velocity of their surrounding envelope ( in the immediate vicinity ) , tidal interactions between the envelope and the fragments transfer both angular momentum and energy from the envelope to the binary .",
    "this action results in an increase in the orbital velocity and hence separation during the subsequent passage through periastron , and consequently a reduction in the orbital eccentricity .",
    "similarly , at periastron , if the orbital velocity of the fragments is larger than the rotational velocity of their surrounding envelope ( in the immediate vicinity ) , tidal interactions between the fragments and the envelope transfer both angular momentum and energy from the binary to the envelope .",
    "this action results in a decrease in the orbital velocity and hence separation during the subsequent passage through apastron , and once again a reduction in the orbital eccentricity .",
    "thus , the probable low orbital eccentricity of l1551irs5 may have been imprinted at birth .",
    "the total mass of l1551irs5 is at least @xmath0@xmath131 ( based on the best - fit orbits ) , compared with a mass for its envelope of about @xmath132 @xcite .",
    "thus , during its remaining protostellar phase , l1551irs5 is not likely to accrete more than @xmath020% of its present total mass and perhaps much less .",
    "thus , both the total mass and the mass ratio of the binary system should be largely preserved as it evolves onto the pre - main - sequence and then the main - sequence .",
    "whether or not the orbital parameters of l1551irs5 will evolve significantly during its remaining protostellar phase is not so clear . in the situation where the binary system dominates in mass over its circumbinary disk ( so that ,",
    "even at apastron , the binary orbits faster than the circumbinary disk rotates ) , as must be the case here , theoretical simulations show that tidal interactions between the binary system and its ( coplanar ) circumbinary disk result in a transfer of both angular momentum and energy from the binary to its circumbinary disk @xcite .",
    "the effect is to drive up the orbital eccentricity , opposite to the situation described above where the envelope dominates in mass over the binary fragments . by preserving the apastron distance , @xmath133",
    ", the effect also is to decrease the orbital semimajor axis .",
    "thus , l1551irs5 will likely evolve into a solar - mass binary system that has roughly equal companion masses , quite closely coplanar circumstellar disks and orbital planes ( especially if tidal interactions between one protostar and the circumstellar disk of the other protostar bring their circumstellar disks further into alignment with the orbital plane ) , and hence presumably also closely aligned stellar spin and orbital axes . unless its orbital parameters are dramatically altered during its subsequent evolution , l1551irs5 will retain a likely circular or low eccentricity orbit with a semimajor axis of many tens to perhaps a few hundred au , and a corresponding orbital period of many hundreds to perhaps a few thousand years . the physical properties that we project l1551irs5 will have in its final state",
    "closely resemble those observed for binary systems on the pre - main - sequence and main - sequence having similar masses and orbital separations ( e.g. , see review by * ? ? ?",
    "such systems do not show a preferred mass ratio or orbital eccentricity , but do exhibit preferentially aligned circumstellar disks on the pre - main - sequence and preferentially aligned stellar spin and orbital axes on the main - sequence .",
    "for example , the circumstellar disks of ttauri star binaries having projected orbital separations spanning the range @xmath01001000au are preferentially aligned to within a few tens of degrees ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "main - sequence solar - type binaries having orbital separations smaller than about 3040au ( close to the median orbital separation ) have approximately aligned spin and orbital axes , whereas those with larger orbital separations commonly show misaligned spin and orbital axes @xcite .",
    "many of the systems that are closely aligned may have formed in a manner similar to l1551irs5 , rather than having being brought into alignment by internal or external interactions .",
    "we have mapped the circumstellar dust disks of the binary protostars l1551irs5 at an unprecedented sensitivity and at a high angular resolution at 7 mm with the vla .",
    "this map also provides a precise second measurement of the relative proper motion of the two protostars separated by a decade ; combined with earlier observations , measurements of their relative proper motion now span an interval of @xmath030yr . by fitting a two - component , two - dimensional gaussian function to each source , with one component corresponding to dust emission from the circumstellar disk and the other to free - free emission from an ionized jet projected against the disk",
    ", we found that :    * the circumstellar disk of the northern ( n ) source has an inclination of @xmath51 and that of the southern ( s ) source an inclination of @xmath52 , so that both disks have nearly the same inclinations * the circumstellar disk of the n source has a position angle for its major axis of @xmath47 and that of the southern ( s ) source a position angle for its major axis of @xmath134 , and so both disks have essentially identical position angles for their major axes      to estimate the sizes of the two circumstellar disks , we fitted a double power - law profile , known as the nuker function , to the jet - subtracted image ( i.e. , circumstellar disk ) of each source . in this way",
    ", we mimic what would be expected if the disks have power - law surface density and temperature profiles ( represented by the inner power - law ) , and a relatively sharp cutoff at their outer edges imposed by tidal interactions with their companion protostars ( represented by the outer power - law ) .",
    "we found that , within the uncertainties , fitting nuker functions yielded the same inclinations and positions angles for the major axes of the two disks as were found by fitting gaussian functions . fixing these parameters at their formal values as mentioned above , from the nuker",
    "fits we found that :    * the circumstellar disk of the n source tapers off sharply at a radius of @xmath012.1au and that of the s source at a radius of @xmath010.3au , values we take as measures of the tidally - truncated radii of the two circumstellar disks    we found that both circular and elliptical orbits , the latter having eccentricities as high as @xmath76 ( the highest that we tried ) , provide acceptable fits to available measurements for the relative proper motion of the binary protostars .",
    "nevertheless , for all the best - fit acceptable orbits :    * there is a clear preference towards a relatively close alignment between the orbital plane and the circumstellar disks .",
    "although some best - fit orbits are coplanar with the circumstellar disks within measurement uncertainties , as a whole there is a systematic tilt of up to typically @xmath025  between the orbital plane of the vast majority of best - fit orbits and the two circumstellar disks    by requiring that the radii of the two circumstellar disks should not exceed their predicted tidally - truncated radii , the best - fit orbits are restricted to primarily those having low eccentricities ( @xmath116 ) . the systematic tilt between these best - fit orbits and the circumstellar disks",
    "are now confined entirely to within @xmath025 .",
    "thus , _ the orbital plane is either coplanar or , more probably , tilted by up to a few tens of degrees from the two circumstellar disks . _",
    "* the inner region of the flattened envelope has an inclination of @xmath63 and a position angle for its major axis @xmath66 , closely comparable with the corresponding parameters for the two circumstellar disks        thus , _ the two protostars have circumstellar disks that are closely parallel with their surrounding envelope , and are orbiting each other in the same direction as the envelope rotation .",
    "_ this close alignment suggests that the angular momentum of material that gave rise to the protostellar system and that comprising its parental core are aligned .    fragmentation driven by local ( small - scale ) turbulence that conspires to generate local angular momentum can produce a binary system having relatively well aligned circumstellar disks and orbital planes . in such cases , however , the binary system would not be expected to share a close geometrical or kinematic relationship with its surrounding envelope ( remnant parental core ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the close geometrical and kinematic relationships seen in l1551irs5 are expected for binary systems that form through rotationally - driven fragmentation of their flattened parental core . in support of this argument , both the measured rotational velocity and the high degree of flattening exhibited by the envelope around l1551irs5 suggest that its parental core possessed considerable angular momentum .",

    "<S> either bulk rotation or local turbulence is widely invoked to drive fragmentation in collapsing cores so as to produce multiple star systems . </S>",
    "<S> even when the two mechanisms predict different manners in which the stellar spins and orbits are aligned , subsequent internal or external interactions can drive multiple systems towards or away from alignment thus masking their formation process . here , we demonstrate that the geometrical and dynamical relationship between the binary system and its surrounding bulk envelope provide the crucial distinction between fragmentation models . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the circumstellar disks of the binary protostellar system l1551irs5 are closely parallel not just with each other but also with their surrounding flattened envelope . </S>",
    "<S> measurements of the relative proper motion of the binary components spanning nearly 30yr indicate an orbital motion in the same sense as the envelope rotation . eliminating orbital solutions </S>",
    "<S> whereby the circumstellar disks would be tidally truncated to sizes smaller than are observed , the remaining solutions favor a circular or low - eccentricity orbit tilted by up to @xmath025  from the circumstellar disks . </S>",
    "<S> turbulence - driven fragmentation can generate local angular momentum to produce a coplanar binary system , but which bears no particular relationship with its surrounding envelope . </S>",
    "<S> instead , the observed properties conform with predictions for rotationally - driven fragmentation . </S>",
    "<S> if the fragments were produced at different heights or on opposite sides of the midplane in the flattened central region of a rotating core , the resulting protostars would then exhibit circumstellar disks parallel with the surrounding envelope but tilted from the orbital plane as is observed . </S>"
