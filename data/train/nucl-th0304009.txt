    "originally the concept of pseudospin was introduced on an observational basis @xcite to explain the quasi - degeneracy of spherical shell orbitals with non relativistic quantum numbers ( @xmath2 ) and ( @xmath3 ) , where @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the single - nucleon radial , orbital angular momentum , and total angular momentum quantum numbers , respectively .",
    "this symmetry approximately persists also for deformed nuclei @xcite and even for the case of triaxiality @xcite .",
    "the origin of pseudospin - symmetry was not well understood for a long time . only in the nineties",
    "its relation to the invariance of the dirac hamiltonian with @xmath7 under specific @xmath8 transformations @xcite has been pointed out @xcite . here , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the scalar and vector potentials , respectively . in the non relativistic limit",

    "a dirac hamiltonian with @xmath7 does not sustain any dirac valence bound state @xcite .",
    "therefore , realistic mean fields used in nuclear structure physics must exhibit at least a weak pseudospin - symmetry violation .",
    "actually the violation is smaller than anticipated from realistic relativistic mean field calculations @xcite .",
    "the question then arises whether this symmetry , associated with @xmath7 , manifests itself also in proton - nucleus scattering . from studies within dirac phenomenology",
    ", the proton - nucleus scattering is described quite well by complex dirac potentials with @xmath14 @xcite . in 1988",

    "they found a significant deviation of the experimental polarization and spin - rotation data from the predicted ones .",
    "based on an algebraic estimate , they concluded that the symmetry is destroyed for low - energy proton scattering and that at high energies only some remnants might survive .",
    "recently , ginocchio @xcite revisited this question and evaluated , in a first order approximation , the ratio @xmath18 between the pseudospin symmetry breaking and the non - breaking part of the scattering amplitude . by considering experimental p-@xmath1pb elastic scattering data at @xmath19mev @xcite , he obtained a relatively small pseudospin dependent part of the scattering amplitude at all scattering angles @xmath17 at which data were available ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "this result , confirmed also by exact calculations @xcite , has been interpreted as an indication for the relevance of pseudospin - symmetry for proton - nucleus scattering  at least at medium energies .",
    "however , to make more conclusive statements about this point systematic studies of proton - nucleus scattering data covering a range of nuclei and energies are required . at present , such studies are hampered by the limited availability of complete data sets .",
    "this is due to the fact that measurements of the spin rotation function are difficult to obtain and therefore data are and will be very scarce .    in the present work we investigate whether conclusive statements on the size of the pseudospin - symmetry breaking part of the proton - nucleus scattering amplitude can be made from polarization and cross section data alone .",

    "therefore , for a more general consideration , an estimate of the absolute value of the pseudospin dependent scattering amplitude @xmath32 should accompany the analysis because it directly refers to the size of the contribution of the pseudospin dependent part .",

    "we shall report some considerations on the coulomb interaction in proton - nucleus scattering and its consequences with regard to pseudospin - symmetry .",
    "first we consider the pure coulomb scattering problem within the dirac equation for which closed - form expressions for the phase shifts @xmath73 are known @xcite , @xmath74 with @xmath75 and @xmath76 here , @xmath77 is the charge of the nucleus , @xmath5 the orbital angular momentum quantum number , @xmath78 the energy , and @xmath24 the wave number of the proton , respectively .",
    "the upper index @xmath79 refers to the angular momentum quantum number @xmath80 . with these phase shifts",
    "the coulomb scattering amplitudes @xmath81 and @xmath82 can be evaluated .",

    "( [ trafo ] ) and yield the ratio @xmath85 which is a measure for the breaking of pseudospin - symmetry by the coulomb interaction . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we show , as an example , this ratio for proton - pb scattering at different energies .",
    "it is seen that pseudospin breaking due to the coulomb potential is largest at 90 degrees and that it decreases with energy .    a satisfactory description of proton - nucleus scattering is usually obtained within the dirac phenomenology using a scalar potential @xmath86 and a fourth component of a vector potential @xmath87 which is composed of a nuclear part @xmath88 and the coulomb potential @xmath89 .",
    "both , @xmath86 and @xmath88 are complex potentials and are frequently taken to be of woods - saxon shape ( see e.g. @xcite ) . the associated scattering amplitudes consist of three contributions , @xmath90 here , the indices n , c , and i denote the nuclear , the coulomb , and the interference contributions , respectively .",
    "the latter takes into account non - linear modifications of the scattering amplitudes due to the superposition of the interactions @xmath91 . via eq .",
    "( [ trafo ] ) one obtains also the corresponding pseudospin representations of the amplitudes @xmath92 and @xmath93 . due to the short range nature of the nuclear interaction , the nuclear parts of the scattering amplitudes decrease more rapidly than the coulomb parts with increasing momentum transfer",
    "therefore , the ratio @xmath94 at increasing scattering angle will be dominated by the coulomb contribution .    in order to demonstrate this characteristic behavior of the scattering amplitudes we study a schematic example of proton-@xmath1pb scattering assuming @xmath86 and @xmath95 to be real and of woods - saxon shape @xmath96^{-1}\\ , ,",

    "the coulomb potential @xmath89 is that of a homogeneously charged sphere with radius @xmath100a@xmath98 . in the first example we consider the nuclear strengths @xmath101mev which implies exact pseudospin - symmetry in the nuclear part .",
    "the corresponding scattering amplitudes have been evaluated for several energies between @xmath102mev and @xmath103mev .    in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] the angular dependence of the absolute values of the ratio @xmath94 is compared with that of the pure coulomb interaction .",
    "this comparison clearly indicates that the ratio @xmath18 approaches at backward angles the values of the pure coulomb interaction . hence , at all energies considered , there exists an angular range with @xmath60-values not compatible with pseudospin - symmetry .",
    "the non - vanishing @xmath60-values are solely caused by the presence of the coulomb potential since the nuclear part alone satisfies , because of @xmath104 , an exact pseudospin - symmetry .",
    "relativistic mean field calculations reveal a small but necessary pseudospin - symmetry breaking nuclear part . in order to simulate this effect",
    "we consider the same scattering system as before but with strengths @xmath105 mev and thus the pseudospin - symmetry is broken by the extra strength @xmath106 . in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] the moduli of the corresponding ratio @xmath94 are shown for different @xmath106-values at @xmath102mev .",
    "qualitatively we observe the same behavior as in the case of @xmath107 .",
    "there are again significant values of @xmath60 at backward angles which are not in agreement with pseudospin - symmetry .",
    "it should be emphasized that in all cases and at all angles considered the @xmath60-values associated with the nuclear part alone do not exceed @xmath108 thus indicating a small pseudospin - symmetry violating contribution .",
    "unfortunately it is not possible to extract the nuclear contribution from the experimental proton - nucleus scattering data , the main reason being the non - linear relationship between potential and scattering amplitudes in the energy region considered .",
    "the importance of higher order born terms is best reflected in the importance of the amplitude @xmath109 . in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] the modulus of @xmath110 is compared with that of @xmath111 and @xmath81 which are of the same size .",
    "it is clear that it is not possible at present to separate the nuclear term without further model assumptions .",
    "we have derived boundaries for the ratio of the pseudospin - dependent to the pseudospin - independent scattering amplitude requiring only the knowledge of polarization data . in addition , we also derived boundaries for the absolute size of the pseudospin dependent scattering amplitude .",
    "these boundaries are based on the differential cross section and polarization data alone and , thus , one can avoid measurements of the spin - rotation function as required by the methods of refs . @xcite .",
    "because of the difficulties in measuring @xmath16 , these constraints could be very useful and represent an improvement with regard to the previous situation .",
    "their use together with the exact relationships derived in @xcite allow us to assess the relevance of pseudospin symmetry in proton - nucleus scattering at various energies .",
    "furthermore , by considering p-@xmath0ni and p-@xmath1pb scattering data the mass number dependence is also shown up .",
    "the results for the ratio @xmath53 exhibit a systematic decrease with increasing energy . at lower proton - nucleus",
    "scattering energies , up to about @xmath112mev , the results obtained indicate that there is a significant symmetry breaking term present which confirms the conjecture of bowlin _ _",
    "@xcite based on analytical estimates . at these energies and at certain scattering angles the extracted @xmath53-values approach 1 , implying that the pseudospin dependent and independent scattering amplitudes are of comparable size .",
    "it should be emphasized here that estimates of @xmath69 exhibit an angular dependence which is quite similar in form and size to that of the differential cross section .",
    "in contrast , at 800mev there is only a weak violation of pseudospin symmetry which confirms the finding of @xcite .    to investigate the origin of this behavior",
    ", we have studied the role played by the coulomb interaction .",
    "considering the coulomb scattering problem within the dirac equation , leads to scattering amplitudes @xmath92 and @xmath93 whose ratio @xmath60 shows a clear peak , with values greater than @xmath113 at @xmath114 degrees , which decreases with energy . assuming typical nuclear interactions of the dirac phenomenology , we have evaluated the ratio @xmath18 in the presence of the coulomb interaction .",
    "the results clearly indicate that the modulus of the ratio @xmath60 , at all energies , exceeds @xmath113 and approach at backward angles that of the coulomb problem .",
    "smaller @xmath60-values are found at small scattering angles which can be attributed to highly non - linear superposition of nuclear and coulomb effects .",
    "one might conjecture that this phenomenon is of the same nature to the cancellation effects observed in the bound state regime @xcite .",
    "anyway it is limited to a small and energy dependent angular region reflecting the finite range of the nuclear interaction . because of the importance of nonlinearities between potential and scattering amplitude ( higher order born terms ) it is impossible to separate from experimental data the nuclear components unambiguously without further model assumptions .",
    "in addition , we did nt find any characteristic behavior of @xmath94 which would give a clear indication of a weakly pseudospin - symmetry violating nuclear term .    in short , proton - nucleus scattering does not exhibit the features of pseudospin - symmetry .",
    "the violation of the symmetry stems from the long range coulomb interaction and shows up in the values of the ratio @xmath18 at large scattering angles .",
    "the previous finding of small values of the moduli of @xmath18 at @xmath103mev proton-@xmath1pb scattering , can be attributed to the limited angular range of the experimental data and can not be considered as a clear sign for the relevance of pseudospin - symmetry in proton - nucleus scattering .",

    "<S> the manifestation of pseudospin - symmetry in proton - nucleus scattering is discussed . </S>",

    "<S> application of these constraints to p-@xmath0ni and p-@xmath1pb scattering data in the laboratory energy range of 200mev to 800mev , reveals a significant violation of the symmetry at lower energies and a weak one at higher energies . using a schematic model within the dirac phenomenology , the role of the coulomb potential in proton - nucleus scattering with regard to pseudospin symmetry is studied . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that the existence of pseudospin - symmetry in proton - nucleus scattering is questionable in the whole energy region considered and that the violation of this symmetry stems from the long range nature of the coulomb interaction . </S>"
