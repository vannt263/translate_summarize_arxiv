    "[ sect : intro ]    periodic structures are very common in physical problems , with the crystalline lattice being the most familiar classical example .",
    "one of the important features of such systems is the existence of _ multiple frequency gaps _ in the wave transmission spectra .",
    "such spectral gaps are responsible for a strong modification of the wave dispersion and diffraction that occurs when waves experience resonant bragg scattering from a periodic structure  @xcite .",
    "when nonlinear self - action becomes important , the systems with periodically modulated parameters demonstrate a number of new effects ; in particular they can support a novel type of solitons , the so - called _ gap solitons _ , which exist in the gaps of the linear wave spectrum due to a strong bragg scattering and coupling between the forward and backward propagating modes  @xcite . during the last years",
    ", it was shown that gap solitons may exist in different types of nonlinear periodic structures including low - dimensional photonic crystals and photonic layered structures  @xcite , waveguide arrays  @xcite , optically - induced photonic lattices  @xcite , and bose - einstein condensates loaded onto an optical lattice  @xcite .",
    "there are known _ two standard approaches _ to study nonlinear localized modes and gap solitons in periodic structures  @xcite .",
    "the first approach is based on the derivation of an effective _ discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation _ and the analysis of its stationary localized solutions in the form of _ discrete localized modes _ or _ discrete solitons _  @xcite . in the solid - state physics",
    ", the similar approach is known as _ the tight - binding approximation _ that , in application to periodic photonic structures , corresponds to the case of weakly coupled defect modes excited in each individual waveguide of the structure .",
    "the analogous concepts appear in the study of other systems such as the bose - einstein condensates in optical lattices  @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "weak nonlinear effects in optical fibers with a periodic modulation of the refractive index are well studied in the framework of the other familiar and well - accepted approach , _ the coupled - mode theory _",
    "the coupled - mode theory for nonlinear periodic structures is based on a decomposition of the wave field into the forward and backward propagating modes , under the condition of the bragg resonance , and the derivation a system of coupled nonlinear equations for those two modes .",
    "such an approach is usually applied to analyze nonlinear localized waves in the systems with a _ weakly modulated _ optical refractive index known as gap ( or bragg ) solitons .    a number of recent experiments in the nonlinear guided wave optics  @xcite and bose - einstein condensates  @xcite were conducted in periodic structures under the conditions when none of those approximations is valid . indeed , one of the main features of the wave propagation in periodic structures is the existence of a set of multiple forbidden gaps in the transmission spectrum . as a result ,",
    "the nonlinearly - induced localization of waves can become possible in each of these gaps  @xcite .",
    "however , the effective discrete equation derived in the tight - binding approximation describes only _ one transmission band _ surrounded by _ two semi - infinite band gaps _ and , therefore , a fine structure of the band - gap spectrum associated with the wave transmission in periodic media is lost in this approach . on the other hand , the coupled - mode theory of gap solitons describes only _ an isolated narrow gap _ in between _ two semi - infinite transmission bands _ , and it does not allow to consider simultaneously the localized modes due to the total internal reflection as well as to study the band coupling and inter - band resonances .",
    "recently , it was realized that the study of the simultaneous existence of localized modes of different types is a very important issue in the analysis of stability of nonlinear localized modes and gap solitons  @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to develop , for the first time to our knowledge , a general analytical description of the existence , bifurcations , and stability of spatially localized nonlinear modes ( i.e. , lattice and gap solitons ) in the framework of an effective continuous model described by the nonlinear schrdinger equation with a periodic external potential .",
    "the use of this well - accepted nonlinear model for our analysis allows us to remove all restrictions of both approaches mentioned above , and to study consistently the effects of the bandgap spectrum on the properties and linear stability of gap solitons .",
    "first , by applying the multi - scale asymptotic analytical methods , we show that such gap solitons may appear in _ all band gaps _ of the periodic potential for any sign of nonlinearity , but they bifurcate from different band edges for different signs of nonlinearity .",
    "second , we demonstrate that , in general , only _ two branches of gap solitons _ bifurcate from each band edge , and one of those two is always linearly unstable .",
    "third , we study stability of gap solitons in a selected band gap and find the soliton internal modes@xcite bifurcating from all other band edges of the same polarity . however , only one internal mode can bifurcate from the band edge where the gap soliton originates itself . at",
    "last , we analyze the conditions when the bifurcation of the internal modes can give rise to complex eigenvalues , which are shown to be responsible for _ oscillatory instabilities _ of gap solitons due to single - gap  @xcite or inter - gap  @xcite resonances .    the paper is organized as follows .",
