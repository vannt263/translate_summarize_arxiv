    "universality in this context means that the shape of the scaling function @xmath29 depends on the geometry and on the boundary conditions but does not depend on any nonuniversal parameter , in particular not on the lattice constant @xmath30 of lattice models or on the cutoff @xmath31 of field theories . as a consequence",
    "it was generally accepted that finite - size scaling functions such as @xmath29 can be calculated on the basis of field theories in the limit @xmath32 [ 3,4,7 - 50 ] .",

    "we have studied the consequences of renormalizability ( in terms of bulk renormalizations ) of the @xmath0 theory in a confined geometry with periodic boundary conditions below four dimensions .",
    "we have found that the consequences for the confined system are in contrast to those for the bulk system . while for the bulk system renormalizability implies that the leading critical _ temperature _ dependence is not significantly affected by a finite lattice constant @xmath30 or by a finite cutoff @xmath31 this is not generally the case for the leading _ size _ dependence of the confined system .",
    "lattice and cutoff effects are asymptotically negligible as criticality is approached at fixed finite ratio @xmath50 but not in the limit @xmath40 above @xmath27 . in the latter case the _ leading _ finite - size effect on the susceptibility @xmath16 turns out to be nonuniversal , i.e. , to depend explicitly on @xmath30 and @xmath31 [ see equations ( 106 ) and ( 122 ) ] , and to violate finite - size scaling in the region @xmath5 of the @xmath57 plane ( fig .",
    "although lattice and continuum models yield the same asymptotic critical behavior of bulk systems we have shown that this is not the case for confined systems .",
    "while lattice systems ( with periodic boundary conditions ) have an exponential size dependence of @xmath60 above @xmath27 for large @xmath50 , a power - law behavior @xmath37 is obtained from the @xmath0 field theory @xcite .",
    "it is expected that part of our conclusions apply also to @xmath71 for the case @xmath359 . for @xmath472 ( and for periodic boundary conditions ) the power - law behavior of the goldstone modes is expected to govern the finite - size deviations from bulk critical behavior such that nonuniversal exponential terms become subleading .",
    "our results for the leading finite - size deviations from bulk critical behavior have been derived for @xmath61 dimensions but our conclusions may be applicable to @xmath358 dimensions . a detailed reexamination of the exponential terms in the existing exact results for",
    "the two - dimensional ising model @xcite would be interesting .",
    "part of our results remain valid also at and above four dimensions .",
    "one of the consequences is that the universal two - variable finite - size scaling form for the @xmath0 lattice model for @xmath62 [ 59,60,63,66 - 68 ] is violated for @xmath40 above @xmath27 for general @xmath34 and below @xmath27 for @xmath359 .",
    "a further consequence is that the predictions of the lowest - mode approach @xcite and of the phenomenological scaling theory implying a single - variable scaling form @xcite fail qualitatively in the region @xmath473 where these theories predict a universal power - law behavior @xmath64 instead of a non - universal exponential size dependence @xmath474 .",
    "the latter can easily be incorporated in our theory above four dimensions @xcite by extending our present perturbation approach of section 4 to @xmath62 @xcite .    from a quantitative point of view , our prediction of a violation of finite - size scaling is difficult to be tested by means of monte carlo simulations ( e.g. , for ising models ) because the non - scaling effect on @xmath16 occurs predominantly in the region @xmath5 where the total finite - size effects on @xmath16 are exponentially small ( for periodic boundary conditions ) .",
    "our general arguments regarding the consequences of renormalizability ( as presented in section 3 ) are presumably not restricted to periodic boundary conditions but may be generalized to _ non - periodic _ boundary conditions .",
    "we consider this to be potentially important for applications to real systems where finite - size deviations from bulk critical behavior are not exponentially small .",
    "we do no longer see a stringent reason to believe that renormalizability implies the validity of finite - size scaling in the more complicated cases of non - periodic boundary conditions where additional renormalizations and nonuniversal length scales come into play . in particular for the important case of confined @xmath73he near the superfluid transition where the entire region @xmath273 and @xmath475 is perfectly well accessible to high - resolution experiments [ 69,70,72 - 77,79,80,90 ] we can not exclude the existence of nonuniversal non - scaling effects in the @xmath0 ( lattice and field ) theory with dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "this could eventually lead to a natural explanation of longstanding and recent discrepancies between experimental data [ 69 - 80 ] and theoretical predictions [ 5,11,24,29,31,32,36,37,42,49 ] that were based on ( seemingly plausible ) assumptions which imply the validity of finite - size scaling . also for the exploration of finite - size effects on transport properties in @xmath73he on earth [ 72,74,79,90 ] and under microgravity conditions",
