    "most of the brightest celestial x - ray sources recorded in a given year are transient outbursts from black hole binaries in the galaxy .",
    "the eruptions are understood as a consequence of a low rate of mass accretion from the companion star @xcite .",
    "the material gradually fills the outer regions of an accretion disk surrounding the black hole .",
    "when the disk surface density reaches a critical value , matter spirals into the inner disk where it reaches x - ray emitting temperatures before falling into the black hole event horizon @xcite .",
    "such x - ray novae are the parent population for identifying black holes that are remnants of massive stars .",
    "the mass of the compact object ( typically 515 ) is deduced from radial velocity studies of the companion star . in most cases",
    "such measurements are only possible when the system has returned to relative quiescence , and the companion can be seen against the glare of the hot gases in the disk . in establishing the nature of the compact object ,",
    "the critical argument is whether the mass exceeds the upper limit ( @xmath3 ) for the mass of a neutron star .",
    "there are now 17 `` dynamical black hole '' binaries in the milky way or lmc : 14 were first noticed as bright x - ray novae @xcite , while the other 3 cases are persistent x - ray sources with o / b type companions .",
    "observations with the _ rossi _ x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) have pioneered efforts to further study black holes and their occasional relativistic jets via broadband x - ray observations during active states of accretion .",
    "the x - ray timing and spectral properties convey information about physical processes that occur near the black hole event horizon , and one of the primary research goals is to obtain constraints on the black hole mass and spin using predictions of general relativity ( gr ) in the strong - field regime .",
    "there is also the need to understand accretion physics for each of the four distinct emission states that are displayed by so many accreting black holes systems . in this paper",
    "we describe recent advances in these topics , with particular attention to the diverse forms of quasiperiodic oscillations ( qpos ) @xcite that have been detected during the extensive monitoring programs for x - ray transients conducted with rxte .",
    "the topic of high - frequency qpos ( hfqpos ) in black hole binaries ( 40 - 450 hz ) has evolved substantially in the last year .",
    "transient hfqpos are detected with rxte  in 5 sources ( 4 dynamical black holes and 1 candidate ) .",
    "these subtle oscillations have rms amplitudes that are typically only @xmath4 % of the mean count rate .",
    "the associated power spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hfqpo ] , and their properties are summarized in table 1 .",
    "three of these sources exhibit pairs of hfqpos : gro  j165540 ( 300 , 450 hz ; @xcite ) , xte  j1550564 ( 184 , 276 hz ; @xcite ) , and grs  1915 + 105 ( 40 , 67 ; @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , in section 3 below we report the detection of additional hfqpos in grs  1915 + 105 at 164 and 328 hz .",
    "the commensurate frequencies ( 3:2 ratio ) in pairs of hfqpos from + gro  j165540 and xte  j1550564 @xcite may suggest a cause in some type of resonance phenomenon involving oscillations proscribed by general relativity , as originally proposed by abramowicz & kluzniak @xcite .",
    "the observations can not be interpreted as non - sinusoidal structures in the wave pattern , in the sense of harmonics in a fourier series , because the individual detections ( in a given energy band ) appear as a single peak in the power spectrum , and their frequencies are recognized as @xmath5 or @xmath6 only when the ensemble of results is examined .        for the strongest qpos in grs  1915 + 105",
    ", efforts were made to track the individual oscillations to determine the origin of the frequency drifts and to measure the average `` qpo - folded '' oscillation profile @xcite .",
    "the results show a random walk in qpo phase , with only minor departures from a sinusoidal waveform .",
    "the ramifications of this study for qpo models remain uncertain .",
    "there are now a large number of proposed lfqpo mechanisms in the literature , and a full review is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the models include global disk oscillations @xcite as well as oscillations in the radial position of complex accretion structures , such as shock fronts @xcite or a transition layer between the disk and a hotter comptonizing region @xcite .",
    "the construction of complex accretion models is driven not only by the need to account for the power - law spectrum , but also by the relatively slow frequencies of lfqpos . given the capacity of lfqpos for high amplitudes and long - term stability ( see table 2 ) , it would be attractive to associate them with keplerian frequencies in the disk ; however , the relevant disk radii are well beyond the expected limits of the x - ray emitting region . an alternative model known as",
    "the `` accretion - ejection instability '' invokes spiral waves in a magnetized disk @xcite , with a transfer of energy out to the radius of corotation with the spiral wave . this model uses magnetic field effects to account for qpos , the power - law spectrum , and perhaps relativistic outflows as well .",
    "further details are given in other papers of this workshop .",
    "recent efforts to understand lfqpos have given attention to the phase lags associated with these oscillations and their harmonics .",
    "the analysis technique uses fourier cross spectra to measure both the phase lags and the coherence parameter ( versus frequency ) between different x - ray energy bands , e.g. 2 - 6 vs. 13 - 30 kev .",
    "unexpectedly , both positive and negative phase lags were found @xcite , and suggestions were made to classify lfqpos by phase lag properties @xcite . while the expansion of lfqpo subtypes may not be a welcome complication , it has been shown that recognition of the phase lag properties allows us to better understand the relationship between certain types of qpos and the conditions in the disk @xcite .",
    "this is illustrated in fig  [ fig:1550lfqpos ] .",
    "furthermore , data selections by lfqpo subtypes provided guidance that helped to establish the harmonic nature of hfqpos in xte  j1550 - 564 and the relationship between lfqpos and hfpqos in that source @xcite .    in closing",
    ", it must be noted that the relevance of x - ray timing studies requires discussions of broad power peaks in the pds @xcite , which are features wider than the limit ( @xmath7 ) used to define qpos .",
    "broad power peaks are involved in important studies such as the means to distinguish accreting black holes from neutron stars @xcite .",
    "the evolution of broad power peaks has also been linked to major behavioral changes in a black hole binary , as shown in disappearance of a broad power feature just at the time when cyg x-1 recently lost its ability to remain in the low - hard state and maintain a steady jet @xcite .",
