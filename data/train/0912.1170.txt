    "besides the intrinsic interest in open clusters ( ocs ) in their own right , it is generally accepted that these objects are fundamental landmarks to probe the galactic disk properties ( see , e.g. , friel 1995 ) .",
    "they are among the very few galactic objects for which meaningful distances can be derived over a large range , which makes them an essential tool to constrain galactic evolution theories .",
    "they also make it possible to derive more accurate ages than are possible with other disk objects .",
    "therefore , the study of the galactic oc system proves very useful to clarify the many queries concerning the assessment of chemical abundance gradients in the disk ( see , e.g. , twarog , ashman & anthony - twarog 1997 ; chen , hou & wang 2003 ) , galactic structure and evolution ( e.g. , janes & adler 1982 ; janes & phelps 1994 ) , interactions between thin and thick disks ( e.g. , sandage 1988 ) , as well as theories of stellar formation and evolution ( e.g. , meynet , mermilliod & maeder 1993 ; phelps & janes 1993 ) .",
    "the oc catalogue by lyng   includes 1700 entries .",
    "however , very little is known about many of them , except for their positions and approximate values of their angular sizes . at present ,",
    "fewer than half of the known ocs have been studied in detail to derive their fundamental parameters .",
    "the current paper is part of a larger project aimed at looking into the formation and evolution of the galactic disk by making use of a growing data base of photometric observations of as many ocs as possible .",
    "thus , this study represents a further , intermediate step in a long - term programme devoted to obtain the fundamental parameters or to refine the quality of observationally determined properties for some unstudied or poorly studied ocs .",
    "@xmath0 photometry has proved to be a valuable tool to obtain the fundamental parameters of star clusters since information on cluster membership , distance , reddening , metallicity and age is obtained through the analysis of ( @xmath4,@xmath5 ) and ( @xmath4,@xmath6 ) colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) . in the year 2000",
    ", we carried out at cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio , chile ) an observational program focused on still unstudied ocs at that time .",
    "we favoured the observation of ocs which were interesting not only because of the derivation of their basic parameters but also because of the possibility they offered of studying the morphology of their red giant evolutionary phases in relation to previous results ( see , e.g. , mermilliod et al .",
    "2001 ) .    in this study ,",
    "we report the results obtained from high - quality ccd @xmath0 photometry down to v @xmath7 21.0 in the fields of the selected ocs berkeley26 , czernik27 , melotte72 , ngc2479 and bh37 .",
    "these objects promised to be very interesting for their relatively old appearance due either to the observed stellar population in the cmds or to their shapes and clustered nature .",
    "the basic parameters of the observed ocs are given in table1 , where the trumpler class was taken from archinal & hynes .",
    "the last two columns list the total number of measured stars in this study and the inferred total number of cluster stars .",
    "the latter , together with the availability of a larger sample of data treated in the same way , will make it easier to establish a future calibration of the trumpler richness class .",
    "all the selected clusters are located in the third galactic quadrant near the galactic plane ( @xmath8@xmath9@xmath8 @xmath10 6@xmath11 ) .",
    "a brief description of these ocs , along with earlier photometric observations , is given below .    _",
    "berkeley26 _ : also known as biurakan 12 @xcite or c0647 + 058 , this cluster seems to be a faint and probably old object in monoceros .",
    "as indicated by its trumpler class ( iii1 m ) , it shows no strong central concentration but can be identified by its relatively dense population compared to that of the field stars ( fig .",
    "1 ) . using 2-micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) data , tadross derived a heliocentric distance of 2.7 @xmath12 0.1 kpc , @xmath2 = 0.54 and an age of 600 myr .",
    "these values , however , do not agree at all with those recently obtained by hasegawa , sakamoto & malasan from ccd @xmath13 photometry carried out with a 65 cm telescope .",
    "in fact , according to these authors , berkeley26 is a very old ( 4.5 gyr ) , highly reddened ( @xmath3 = 0.80 ) and very distant ( d = 7.8 kpc ) oc .    _",
    "czernik27 _ : this is a relatively faint cluster first recognized in monoceros by czernik .",
    "as indicated by its trumpler class ( iii1p ) , czernik27 ( iau designation c0700 + 064 ) is one of the most poorly defined objects of the present sample .",
    "it has a relatively small angular size of about 3@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "kim et al . and",
    "hsm08 reported @xmath15 and @xmath13 ccd photometry in the cluster field , respectively .",
    "the cluster parameters determined in both cases , however , do not show a close correlation .",
    "kim et al . found that czernik 27 is a moderately reddened ( @xmath2 = 0.15 ) hyades like age cluster located at 5.8 kpc from the sun , while hsm08 concluded that this is a slightly reddened ( @xmath2 @xmath7 0.08 ) and older ( 1.1 gyr ) oc located at 4.3 kpc from the sun .    _",
    "melotte72 _ : according to archinal & hynes , this object is the same as collinder467 @xcite .",

    "they found this object to be an intermediate - age cluster ( 1.6 gyr ) located at a distance of 3.2 kpc , with reddening @xmath3 = 0.10 .    _",
    "ngc2479 _ :",
    "this object , also referred to as collinder167 @xcite , c0752 - 175 or trumpler8 @xcite , is a relatively bright cluster in puppis . as shown in fig .",
    "1 , there are several bright stars in the cluster field , many of which seem to be foreground stars .",
    "lyng   reported an angular diameter of 11@xmath14 for ngc2479 .",
    "kharchenko et al .",
    "presented a catalogue of astrophysical data for 520 galactic ocs -among them ngc2479- which could be identified in their all - sky compiled catalogue ( ascc-2.5 ) . by applying homogeneous methods and algorithms , they determined basic parameters for their cluster sample . for ngc2479",
    ", they found the following results : @xmath2 = 0.10 , d = 1.2 kpc and @xmath1 1 gyr .",
    "we should be cautious , however , when considering these findings since the limiting magnitude of the ascc-2.5 is @xmath4 @xmath7 12.5 .    _",
    "bh37 _ : this is a detached , moderately rich and relatively faint oc ( fig .",
    "1 ) . as far as we know , no previous data exist for this compact object ( iau designation c0834 - 434 ) first recognized as an open cluster in vela by van den bergh & hagen .    the present photometric data are used to determine reddening , distance , age and metallicity of the selected ocs .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows : section 2 presents the observational material and the data reduction , whereas in section 3 we determine the cluster centres and the stellar density radial profiles . in section 4",
    "we explain how to minimize the field star contamination in the cmds .",
    "section 5 deals with the determination of cluster fundamental parameters through the fitting of theoretical isochrones and with the comparison with previous results .",
    "finally , section 6 summarizes our findings and conclusions .",
    "we obtained images for the cluster sample in december 2000 with the @xmath0 filters and a 2048@xmath172048 pixel tektronix ccd attached to the ctio 0.9 m telescope .",
    "the detector used has a pixel size of 24 @xmath18 m , producing a scale on the chip of 0.4pixel@xmath19 ( focal ratio f/13.5 ) and a 13.6@xmath14x13.6@xmath14 field of view . in order to standardize our photometry , we carried out observations of standard stars of the selected areas pg0231 + 051 , 92 and 98 of landolt . by the end of each night",
    ", we had collected an average of 45 different measures of magnitude per filter for the selected standard star sample .",
    "table 2 shows the logbook of the observations with filters , exposure times , airmasses and seeing estimates .",
    "observational setups , data reduction procedures , stellar point spread function photometry and transformation to the standard system , follow the same prescriptions described in detail in piatti , clari & ahumada . the standard star photometry shows the mean square root deviation of the observations from the fits to be less than 0.015 mag , indicating that the nights were photometric . once the standard magnitudes and colours were obtained , we produced a master table containing the average of @xmath4 , @xmath20 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , their errors @xmath21(@xmath4 ) , @xmath21(@xmath20 ) , @xmath21(@xmath5 ) and @xmath21(@xmath6 ) and the number of observations for each star , respectively .",
    "tables 3 to 7 provide this information for berkeley26 , czernik27 , melotte72 , ngc2479 and bh37 , respectively .",
    "only a portion of these tables is shown here for guidance regarding their form and content .",
    "tables 3 to 7 are shown in entirety in the online version of the journal .",
    "the deepest ccd images obtained for the cluster sample are shown in fig .",
    "1 . in most cases",
    "the cluster region is only a small part of the observed frame , as indicated by the solid circles .",
    "a simple inspection of tables 3 to 7 shows that stars with three measures of @xmath5 and @xmath6 colours extend from the brightest limit down to @xmath4 = 19 mag and 20 mag , respectively .",
    "the stars with two measures of @xmath5 and @xmath6 colours cover @xmath4 ranges from 13.0 to 20.0 mag and from 13.0 to 21 mag , respectively .",
    "finally , the stars with only one measure of @xmath5 and @xmath6 are fainter than @xmath4 = 18.0 and 19.0 mag , respectively , and they reach the photometric magnitude limits . according to these crude statistics , stars lying within the brightest @xmath1",
    "6 mags of our @xmath1 9 mag range were measured two and three times .",
    "therefore , they are the most appropriate ones to use to derive astrophysical information .",
    "the behaviour of the photometric errors for the @xmath4 magnitude and @xmath20 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 colours as a function of @xmath4 is shown in table 8 . since those observed only once have practically no statistical weight , we decided to use all the stars .",
    "in addition , the knowledge of the behaviour of the photometric errors with the magnitude for these stars , allows us to rely on the accuracy of the morphology and position of the main cluster features in the cmds .",
    "the resulting cmds are drawn in figs . 3 , 4 and 5 which show , in general , broad sequences .",
    "it should be noticed that since we have measured just a handful of stars in the @xmath22 passband for berkeley26 , we only show the ( @xmath4,@xmath5 ) and ( @xmath4,@xmath6 ) cmds for this cluster .",
    "kim et al . obtained @xmath15 ccd photometry for stars in the field of czernik27 . for 992 stars measured in common by kim et al . and",
    "in this study , we derived @xmath23 - @xmath24 = 0.35 @xmath12 0.07 mag , @xmath25 - @xmath26 = -0.05 @xmath12 0.11 mag and @xmath27 - @xmath28 = 0.07 @xmath12 0.08 mag , with a marginal dependence with the magnitude ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . since kim et al . also found @xmath29 and @xmath4 magnitude offsets when comparing their photometry for berkeley29 with that of kaluzny , they decided to apply such offset to the czernik27 s photometry .",
    "this prevented us from using their data as a photometric reference .",
    "kim et al . also obtained @xmath15 data for only 18 stars in the field of ngc2479 reaching a limiting magnitude of @xmath4 @xmath7 12.5 - 13.0 mag , so that only a small portion of the cluster main sequence ( ms ) could be traced .",
    "when comparing their magnitudes and colours with those observed by us , we find @xmath30 - @xmath24 = -0.03 @xmath12 0.39 mag and @xmath31 - @xmath26 = -0.02 @xmath12 0.34 mag .",
    "recently , hsm08 published ccd @xmath13 photometry for berkeley26 , czernik27 and melotte72 . unfortunately",
    ", since the data are neither available in the webda database @xcite nor upon request to the authors , we could not compare our photometry with theirs .",
    "we first determined the location of the clusters centres in order to construct stellar density profiles .",
    "the coordinates of the clusters centres and their estimated uncertainties were determined , for each cluster , by fitting gaussian distributions to the star counts in the @xmath32 and @xmath33 directions .",
    "the fits of the gaussians were performed using the ngaussfit routine in the stsdas / iraf package .",
    "we adopted a single gaussian and fixed the constant to the corresponding background level and the linear terms to zero .",
    "the stars projected along the @xmath32 and @xmath33 directions were counted within intervals of 50 pixels .",
    "in addition , we checked that using spatial bins from 20 to 50 pixels or from 50 to 100 pixels does not lead to significant changes in the derived centres .",
    "we iterated the fitting procedure once on average , after eliminating a couple of discrepant points .",
    "then , we determined the clusters centres with a typical ngaussfit standard deviation of @xmath12 10 pixels .",
    "the centres of the gaussians for berkeley26 , czernik27 , melotte72 , ngc2479 and bh37 were finally fixed at ( @xmath34 ) = ( 1170 , 1300 ) , ( 1320 , 1270 ) , ( 1370 , 1210 ) , ( 1215 , 1250 ) and ( 1230 , 1030 ) pixels , respectively .",
    "we constructed the clusters radial profiles from star counts made in boxes of 50 pixels by 50 pixels , distributed throughout the whole field of each cluster .",
    "the chosen size of the box allowed us to sample , statistically , the stellar spatial distributions avoiding spurious effects caused mainly by the presence of localized groups of stars , rows or columns of stars .",
    "thus , the number of stars per unit area , at a given radius @xmath35 , can be directly calculated through the expression :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 and @xmath38 represent the number of stars and boxes included in a circle of radius @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "note that this method does not necessarily require a complete circle of radius @xmath35 within the observed field to estimate the mean stellar density at such distance .",
    "this is important to consider since having a stellar density profile , which extends far away from the cluster centre , allows us to estimate the background level with higher precision .",
    "this is also helpful to measure the fwhm of the stellar density profile for it plays a significant role - from a stellar content point of view - in the construction of the cluster cmds .",
    "the resulting density profiles are shown in fig .",
    "the uncertainties estimated at various distances from the cluster centres follow poisson statistics .",
    "table 9 lists the estimated background levels , the radii at the fwhm ( @xmath40 ) and the field star contamination estimated in percentages .",
    "note that the percentage of field stars is relatively high , which indicates a relatively small ratio between the number of each cluster s stars and the number of field stars .",
    "no cluster stands out clearly in its surrounding field within @xmath40 .",
    "without a careful analysis of the observed sequences in the cmds , one could come to the conclusion that they are in fact the clusters mss .",
    "however , all the cmds present both cluster and field star mss more or less superimposed .",
    "this means that we have observed both star clusters and their respective foreground fields affected by nearly similar reddenings , which makes it difficult to separate the fiducial cluster features and renders the analysis of the cmds challenging .    to statistically clean the cluster cmds from stars that can potentially belong to the foreground / background fields , we built star field cmds using the stars located in the easternmost strip of the observed fields , i.e. , @xmath32 @xmath41 500 pixels and 0 @xmath41 @xmath33 ( pixels ) @xmath41 2050 ( see , fig .",
    "1 ) . we separately treated the cmds for @xmath5 and @xmath6 . using these field cmds",
    ", we counted how many stars lie in different magnitude - colour bins with sizes [ @xmath42@xmath4 , @xmath42@xmath43=@xmath42@xmath44 = ( 0.5,0.1 ) mag .",
    "we then subtracted from each cluster cmd the number of stars counted for each range of the field ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 or @xmath6 ) cmd , by removing those stars closer in magnitude and colour to the ones in the star field .",
    "7 , 8 and 9 show the cmds of the cluster surrounding field regions , while figs .",
    "10 , 11 and 12 show , with filled circles , the circular extracted cmds which were obtained after cleaning them for field star contamination .",
    "we show overplotted the cmds directly obtained with all the measured stars ( dots ) .",
    "when comparing observed and cleaned cluster cmds , the differences in stellar composition became evident .",
    "although the fiducial features of some clusters looked clearer , they appeared somewhat dispersed and scattered .",
    "this is mainly due to some unavoidable field interference .",
    "other sources of dispersion such as photometric errors , differential internal cluster reddening , evolutionary effects and binarity can also account for such effect .",
    "in the subsequent analysis , we used the cleaned cmds to estimate the cluster fundamental parameters . note that we will only use the extracted ( @xmath4,@xmath6 ) cmd of berkeley26 since no star remains in its extracted ( @xmath4,@xmath5 ) cmd .",
    "in order to estimate the ages of the observed clusters , we used the morphological age index ( mai ) defined by janes & phelps on the basis of the @xmath45@xmath4 , @xmath45@xmath46 and @xmath45@xmath47 indices of phelps , janes & montgomery as well as the @xmath42@xmath4 age index calibrated by carraro & chiosi .",
    "we also illustrate possible solutions for the fundamental cluster parameters by matching theoretical isochrones computed by lejeune & schaerer to the observed cmds .",
    "the previously known values of some cluster physical properties were used as reference to select the isochrones which best matched the cmds .    _ berkeley26 : _ the region delimited by @xmath4 @xmath41 18 and @xmath6 @xmath48 1.4 would seem to contain cluster giants .",
    "we derived an age between 2 and 6 gyr from the @xmath42@xmath4 index , which agrees with the age resulting from the mai ( 2.0 - 5.5 gyr ) .",
    "if we use a 4 gyr isochrone , which corresponds to the average age obtained from the mai and the @xmath42@xmath4 index , and we match it to the observed ( @xmath4,@xmath6 ) cmd , we then get a fit consistent with the data .",
    "indeed , the theoretical turnoff and subgiant branch magnitudes , the loci of the ms and of the red giant branch ( rgb ) , and the slope of the rgb , all appear to be reasonably located with respect to the observed features . using isochrones of 2 or 6 gyr",
    ", we did not find successful fits that reproduced the observed @xmath6 distance between the ms turnoff and the bluest rgb point .",
    "_ czernik27 : _ since it is not possible to obtain only one solution from the zams fitting for the reddening - distance modulus pair , we assumed solar metallicity to evaluate which of both sets of published fundamental parameters ( see sect .",
    "1 ) best resembles the fiducial features observed in the cmds .",
    "we find the curvature and shape of the upper ms , the brightest magnitude of the ms and the bluest point of the turnoff , reasonably well fitted by the isochrones of 660 myr and 1.1 gyr .",
    "_ melotte72 : _ a red giant clump ( rgc ) is visible at @xmath4 @xmath1 13 mag and @xmath5 @xmath1 @xmath6 @xmath1 1.0 mag .",
    "we derived an age between 0.4 and 1.0 gyr from both the @xmath42@xmath4 age index and the mai . by using a solar metallicity 0.6 gyr isochrone , it is possible to obtain a reasonable match to the cluster cmds .",
    "the theoretical locus of the rgc , the brightest magnitude of the ms and the bluest point of the turnoff are the features which appear to be consistent with the data .    _",
    "ngc2479 : _ the cluster shows a very long star sequence and a compact rgc at @xmath4 @xmath1 12 and @xmath20 = @xmath6 @xmath1 1.0 mag .",
    "firstly , we derived the colour excesses from both colour - colour diagrams , by shifting the zams along the directions of the corresponding reddening vectors @xcite .",
    "secondly , once the reddening effect was accounted for , we used the observed zams ( @xmath4 @xmath48 14 mag ) to obtain the apparent distance modulus .",
    "the cluster age turned out to be in the 0.6 - 1.2 gyr range from both the mai and the @xmath42@xmath4 index .",
    "moreover , by using a solar metallicity 1 gyr isochrone , we achieved a good match to the fiducial features observed in the cmds .",

    "the cluster has not been studied in detail yet , we attempted a subjective isochrone match to the cluster cmds .",
    "schlegel , finkbeiner & davis s ( 1998 , hereafter sfd ) obtained full - sky maps from 100-m dust emission .",
    "they found that in high galactic latitude regions , the dust map correlates well with maps of hi emission .",
    "however , deviations are coherent in the sky and are especially conspicuous in regions of hi emission saturation towards denser clouds and in regions of formation of h@xmath49 in molecular clouds @xcite",
    ". even if the sfd s reddenings would not be exactly correct , they may still be valuable to compare with the reddenings derived here .",
    "we obtained @xmath50 values of 0.61 , 0.19 , 0.22 , 0.16 and 2.19 mags for berkeley26 , czernik27 , melotte72 , ngc2479 and",
    "bh37 , respectively . since the @xmath50 value for bh37 turned out to be more than double the one we estimated , we assumed that the @xmath50 value must be saturated .",
    "it is worth considering that the ve clusters lie further than 70 pc from the galactic plane , with heights out of the galactic plane of 0.17 kpc , 0.49 kpc , 0.28 kpc , 0.14,kpc and -0.07 , respectively .",
    "table 10 shows the values of the resulting fundamental parameters , while figs .",
    "13 , 14 and 15 indicate how the isochrones match the cluster features in the cmds .",
    "note that these values illustrate only possible solutions for the cluster fundamental parameters .",
    "such solutions prove to be consistent with the data obtained .",
    "13 shows that the ms of berkeley26 is very broad , probably due to differential reddening and field star contamination .",
    "although the three brighter and bluer stars than the turnoff are considered to be foreground stars , some of them could be blue stragglers .",
    "similarly , some of the brighter and bluer stars than the ms turnoff of czernik27 ( fig .",
    "14 ) should also be considered blue straggler candidates . in order to improve the trace of the cluster features",

    "note that the theoretically computed bluest stage , during the core he - burning phase , is redder than the observed rgc in the cmds of melotte72 , a behaviour which has also been detected in other studies of galactic and magellanic cloud clusters ( * ? ? ?",

    "\\(ii ) cluster cmds cleaned from field star contamination were built by statistically subtracting the number of stars counted in the field cmds .",
    "those stars closer in magnitude and colour to the ones in the respective star fields were thus removed .",
    "\\(iii ) estimates of the cluster ages were obtained for berkeley26 , melotte72 and ngc2479 from both the @xmath42@xmath4 age index and the mai . on the other hand , we outlined possible solutions for cluster fundamental parameters by matching theoretical isochrones , which reasonably reproduce the main cluster features in their cmds . in the case of ngc2479 ,",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath3 colour excesses and apparent distance modulus were estimated from the fit of the zams to the colour - colour and magnitude - colour diagrams , respectively .",
    "we are gratefully indebted to the ctio staff for their hospitality and support during the observations .",
    "we also thank referees bruce twarog and kenneth janes whose comments and suggestions have helped us to improve the manuscript .",
    "this work was partially supported by the argentinian institutions conicet , secyt ( universidad nacional de crdoba ) and agencia nacional de promocin cientfica y tecnolgica ( anpcyt ) .",
    "this work is based on observations made at cerro tololo inter - american observatory , which is operated by aura , inc .",
