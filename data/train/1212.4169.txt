    "stellar masses of galaxies are typically estimated from a model mass - to - light ( m / l ) ratio ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and a measurement of the integrated luminosity at optical or near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "until recently , galaxy m / l ratios were thought to be relatively well behaved , especially at near - infrared wavelengths where the effects of dust and massive main sequence stars are minimized .",
    "however , in the past decade this assumption has been shown to be flawed because of the influence of short - lived but extremely luminous thermally - pulsing asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) stars ( * ? ? ?",

    "just as the near - ir fluxes of galaxies are often used to estimate their stellar masses , mid - ir fluxes can be used to estimate their star formation rates .",
    "for instance , at rest - frame 8 , the flux from starbursts is typically dominated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission which scales with the star formation rate ( sfr ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "likewise the rest - frame 24  flux has been shown to scale with the ir luminosity of a galaxy and is therefore used as a sfr indicator @xcite .",
    "however , calibrations of these sfr indicators typically ignore the possibility of stellar contamination in the flux at these wavelengths .",
    "several works have shown that , under certain assumptions , agb stars could contribute significantly to the mid - ir fluxes of galaxies and therefore affect the sfrs estimated from their mid - infrared fluxes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "however , as will be discussed in this paper , some of their assumptions may be flawed .",
    "the agb is a short - lived phase ( @xmath4 myr , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) near the end of stellar evolution when a star undergoes helium shell burning and swells to a large size , producing a relatively cool photosphere and , potentially , a very infrared- ( ir- ) luminous star .",

    "an isolated star will start its agb phase with an oxygen - rich atmosphere ( e.g.,o - agb ) .",
    "however , during the later stages of agb evolution , a star undergoes a series of thermal - pulses and carbon , dredged up from the interior , pollutes the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "when the c / o ratio exceeds unity the star is classified as a carbon star ( e.g. , c - agb ) , and complex molecules and dust grains form in the escaping winds .",
    "these dust grains tend to obscure the star at optical and near - ir wavelengths , but the same dust emits in the mid - ir .",
    "only 20% of the agb stars in the lmc / smc are estimated to be thermally - pulsing ( bruzual , private communication ) .",
    "however , these tp - agb stars can be very luminous in the infrared , typically exceeding the luminosity of the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) , sometimes by several magnitudes .",

    "these stars can not be easily selected in cmd space because they overlap the rgb stars . however , as these agb stars are also relatively rare by number compared with the equally luminous rgb , they will not contribute significantly to the total flux of the galaxy .",

    "the contamination is largest for the rsg population of the smc ( @xmath17% ) . in the lmc",
    "the rsg contamination is negligible because the higher metallicity of the lmc causes all of the rsg and agb stars to be redder than they are in the smc , resulting in less overlap with the foreground sources in the near - ir cmd ( see figure [ fig : cmd ] ) . likewise ,",

    "measuring the total luminosity of the magellanic clouds is challenging because of their very large areas on the sky .",
    "ground - based , near - ir images are dominated by thermal background flux , and thus accurately discerning sky from unresolved galaxy becomes nearly impossible . fortunately these issues are largely eliminated by going to space , where the ir thermal background is minimal and cobe / dirbe @xcite provides a large beam on the sky ( nearly a degree ) .",

    "while the stellar flux is declining with wavelength , the warm dust and pah components are increasing .",
    "we compare these integrated galaxy fluxes gathered from the literature to the fluxes from the tp - agb and rsg stars as measured from 2mass and _ spitzer _ photometry .",
    "the 2mass @xmath11 and @xmath12-bands are similar to the cobe / dirbe 1.25 and 2.2  filters , however the dirbe filters are 0.05  ( 15% ) wider at the long wavelength end . similarly , the cobe / dirbe 3.5  filter is slightly bluer and about 25% wider than the  3.6  filter .",
    "these slight filter miss - matches may increase the uncertainties on the measured agb and rsg flux fractions by modest amounts .",
    "there are no filter mis - matches for the @xmath19  flux ratios , as all measurements are made from the same  images .      in the following section we report the fractional flux contribution of tp - agb and rheb stars to the magellanic clouds as given by :    @xmath20",
    "the uncertainties for these measurements are constructed from the following components .",
    "first , we assume the published uncertainties for the integrated fluxes of the magellanic clouds at each wavelength .",
    "second , we compile the photometric uncertainty in the integrated stellar flux from the photometric uncertainty of each star added in quadrature .",

    "we propagate these uncertainties through equation 1 .",
    "fourth , we include an estimate of the uncertainty introduced by agb stars that are fainter than the trgb as described in section 2.1 .",
    "finally , we have quantified how much of the tp - agb and rsg population we have missed due to limited spatial coverage within the apertures we used to measure each galaxy s integrated flux . in both galaxies , the tp - agb and rsg stars follow a spherical distribution centered on the bars ( e.g. , blum et al .",
    "2006 ; boyer et al .",
    "2011 ) . for the smc ,",
    "the sage footprint includes an additional strip of coverage that extends @xmath216 degrees along the smc tail , and for the lmc , the sage coverage stretches along the disk , @xmath214.5 degrees from the bar s center .",
    "we can use this extended coverage to measure the radial profile of agb stars in the bars by counting the number of agb stars in concentric ellipses centered on the bars .",
    "we find that the agb population is rather tightly concentrated , dropping to very small numbers by about 2 degrees ( along the minor axes ) from the population centers . by extrapolating these radial profiles in all directions",
    ", we estimate that we have missed about 500 smc agb stars and 900 lmc agb stars ( 10 smc rsgs and 20 lmc rsgs ) by restricting our apertures to 2.25 and 3.75 degrees for the smc and lmc , respectively . assuming that the missed stars have a similar flux distribution as the measured tp - agb / rsg population , this amounts to an extra @xmath221% uncertainty on the integrated agb ( and rsg ) flux , which we have included in the upper uncertainties in table 1 and figure 2 .",
    "figure [ fig : agb ] shows the fraction of the integrated galaxy light produced by tp - agb ( open symbols ) and rsg ( plus symbols ) stars in the smc and lmc as a function of wavelength from 124  .",
    "these results are also presented in table 1 . at 3.6  ,",
    "these rare stars contribute over 30% of the smc flux even though they represent a negligible fraction of the stellar mass of the galaxy ( numbers of stars of each type are also shown in table 1 ) . in the lmc , they contribute more than a quarter of the 3.6  light . at 24  ,",
    "the stellar contribution to the total luminosity is @xmath223% for both galaxies .",
    "the flux contribution from rsg stars , which are bluer than agb stars , peaks near @xmath23 . in the smc , they are responsible for over 10% of the @xmath6-band light . in the lmc ,",
    "the fraction is lower , 7% .",
    "part of this difference is no doubt due to the detailed star formation histories of these two galaxies over the last 0.1 gyr , with the smc having a higher specific star formation rate over that period ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the flux contribution from tp - agb stars peaks in the _ spitzer _ irac bands between 3 and 4  , reaching @xmath24% for both the lmc and smc .",
    "the similarity of the results for the two galaxies suggests that over the longer time scale of @xmath25 gyr , these galaxies have had similar star formation histories , as has been inferred by studies of their cmds @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : agb ] also shows the tp - agb populations sub - divided into the 3 categories previously discussed : o - agb , c - agb , and x - agb . despite the fact that the o - agb population outnumbers the c - agb population by a factor of 1.8 in the smc and 2.4 in the lmc , the contribution to the global flux of the o - agb and c - agb populations are similar at @xmath26  , with each contributing roughly equal parts to the total tp - agb flux",
    ". however , the contribution from o - agb stars peaks at shorter wavelengths ( near 2.2  ) than the c - agb star contribution ( near 3.6  ) .",
    "in contrast , the x - agb stars account for less than 1% of the global flux at @xmath27  , but exceed the flux contribution of the other two tp - agb types at @xmath28  .",
    "this is true even though the x - agb population is tiny by numbers , comprising @xmath224% of the total number of tp - agb stars in both galaxies .",
    "we present , for the first time , the near- through mid - ir flux contributions of complete samples of tp - agb and rsg stars to the integrated luminosities of the magellanic clouds .",
    "we find that these stars can contribute non - negligible flux fractions from 1 to 8  ( e.g. , @xmath29% ) , and smaller fractions at 24  ( e.g. , @xmath30% ) .",
    "below we compare these results to previous work and discuss the implications for estimating stellar masses and star formation rates of galaxies .",
    "rest - frame near - ir fluxes typically anchor the stellar mass estimates of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "at these wavelengths , dust obscuration is significantly reduced compared with optical light , and a galaxy s near - ir luminosity is much less affected by the short - lived o- and b - type stars produced by current star formation . instead",
    ", the near - ir is typically thought to be dominated by older , easily modeled rgb stars .",
    "however , we have shown that tp - agb and massive rsg stars can also account for large fractions of the near - ir light ( e.g. @xmath31% at 3.6  for the smc ) , even though they contribute essentially nothing to the total stellar masses of galaxies .",
    "a galaxy with the same 3.6  luminosity as the smc but comprised of entirely old stellar populations ( e.g. , @xmath32 gyr ) must be nearly twice as massive as the smc to make up for the missing stellar luminosity provided by the tp - agb and rsg at that wavelength .",
    "thus , a galaxy s flux at 34  ( and hence its m / l ratio ) is highly sensitive to the sfh .",
    "the large tp - agb and rsg near - ir flux contributions we measure for the magellanic clouds fit well with the contributions reported in @xcite for a sample of 23 nearby dwarfs and small spirals , which ranged from @xmath33% at 1.6  .",
    "similarly , our results are well matched to the predictions of @xcite , which discussed the contribution of agb stars to the @xmath6-band flux of their stellar population synthesis models .",
    "their results for a galaxy with @xmath34 and a declining sfr with an e - folding time of 1  gyr are consistent with what we see in the magellanic clouds .",
    "these large flux contributions suggest that galaxies with even modest populations of tp - agb and rsg stars will have very different near - ir m / l ratios than galaxies lacking these populations , making near - ir based stellar mass estimates difficult .",
    "however , some authors find significantly smaller near - ir flux contributions from tp - agb stars .",
    "for instance , @xcite calculate a smaller 3.6  flux contribution from the tp - agb in the magellanic clouds , only 5% of the integrated light .",
    "they selected agb stars using the @xmath35-[4.5]$ ] color , however , they selected a cmd region that is comprised predominantly of x - agb stars .",
    "thus they miss the bulk of the tp - agb altogether .",
    "the top panel of figure [ fig : hist ] shows the distribution of @xmath35-[4.5]$ ] colors of tp - agb stars in the lmc .",
    "the @xcite sample has a mean color similar to the x - agb alone ( green dot - dashed line ) , which are significantly redder than the overall sample ( dotted line ) .",
    "if we compare only the x - agb stars in our sample to their result , we find a similarly small contribution of @xmath36% . including the full tp - agb sample results in a much higher flux contribution at 3.6  , as discussed above .",
    "@xcite shows a similar result to @xcite , only they used unresolved  3.6 and 4.5  observations of galaxies in the  survey of stellar structure in galaxies ( s@xmath37 g * ? ? ?",
    "their work spatially separates ( on a pixel - by - pixel basis ) older stellar populations from warm dust , pah emission , and evolved stars , based on the colors of regions in the  data .",
    "thus they are able to nicely constrain the warm dust and pah emission to roughly @xmath38% of the 3.6  flux in a sample of 6 nearby galaxies .",
    "likewise they find that pixels dominated by evolved agb and rsg stars account for only another roughly 5% of the 3.6  light .",
    "however , as with the @xcite result , their assumed agb color of @xmath35-[4.5]=0.24 - 0.76 $ ] ( grey shaded region of figure [ fig : hist ] ) is significantly redder than the bulk of the tp - agb stars in the lmc which have a mean color of @xmath35-[4.5]=0.0 $ ] ( red dot - dot - dot - dashed line ) .",

    "unfortunately , that means that @xcite has only selected the reddest tp - agb stars and , as a result , they are likely under - estimating the contribution of tp - agb stars at 3.6  .",
    "the results we have presented here suggest that the near - ir may not be optimized for stellar mass estimates of galaxies .",
    "the 3.6  band , in particular , is the most problematic for the effects of short - lived tp - agb and rsg stars , which can impose a stochastic variability on the near - ir m / l ratio of stellar populations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , it should be possible to minimize the effects of the tp - agb and rsg stars on estimates of the near - ir m / l ratios of galaxies by using bluer wavebands .",
    "the tp - agb and rsgs flux contribution at 1  is roughly half that of the 3.6-  flux contribution . of course",
    ", bluer wavelengths will be more impacted by extinction from dust and emission from hot o and b stars , but the @xmath39- or @xmath11-band may prove to be the ideal compromise . to test this hypothesis",
    "we compare the point - source flux above the trgb to the total point - source flux ( which is measurable to 2.5 mags below the trgb ) as a function of wavelength from @xmath40  .",
    "figure [ fig : bestlam ] displays the results , and shows that indeed there is a minimum flux contribution from luminous short - lived stars as a function of wavelength . the minimum occurs between 0.8 and 1 . at shorter wavelengths , massive main sequence o and b stars contribute large fractions of light . at longer wavelengths ,",
    "the tp - agb and rsg stars contribute large fractions .",
    "this plot suggests that rest - frame @xmath41 through @xmath42band will indeed provide m / l ratios that are the most stable against stellar population history and the influence of these short - lived luminous stars .      because mid - ir light is produced by warm dust and pah emission in star forming regions , mid - ir luminosities of galaxies are often used as proxies for their current star formation rates .",
    "however , we have shown that the tp - agb and rsg stars can also contribute to the mid - ir fluxes of galaxies , with the bulk of the mid - ir contribution coming from the rare but extremely dusty x - agb stars . in the smc ,",
    "the contribution of tp - agb and rsg stars at 8  is @xmath4319% !",
    "if these x - agb stars are neglected in the accounting of the mid - ir light , an smc sfr based on 8  light alone will be biased high .",
    "this result has impacts on the interpretation of thousands of mid - ir based star formation rates , for example at @xmath2 ,  24  imaging traces rest - frame 8  , where the tp - agb is potentially an important flux contributor .",
    "however , the size of the effect may be small in practice . for instance , in the lmc , the tp - agb + rsg 8  contribution is @xmath44% .",
    "compared with the smc , the lmc has a significantly larger contribution from warm dust and 8  pah emission ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and figure [ fig : agb ] here ) .",
    "samples of the extremely dusty @xmath2 galaxies detected by  have been shown to have large pah flux contributions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so the correction for tp - agb stars may be small in the high-@xmath45 luminous infrared galaxies .",
    "however , it is possible that tp - agb stars artificially elevate the the rest - frame 8  estimated sfrs of galaxies , especially for lower - metallicity systems like the smc where ( 1 ) pah emission is limited , ( 2 ) c - agb stars are more common , and ( 3 ) star formation rates are likely smaller .",
    "we are not the first to point out that the tp - agb may be important at mid - ir wavelengths .",
    "for instance , @xcite , and @xcite recently proposed tp - agb stars as the primary source of mid - ir flux in galaxies , and may account for the rise of luminous infrared galaxies with redshift .",
    "similarly , @xcite suggested dusty shells surrounding agb stars could account for the bulk of diffuse 24  emission in the outskirts of m33 . while our results show the importance of tp - agb stars at mid - ir wavelengths , these earlier works likely overemphasize the tp - agb contribution , especially at 24 , where we show that tp - agb stars contribute less than 3% of the magellanic cloud flux .",
    "the large mid - ir tp - agb contributions predicted by these previous works ( e.g. @xmath46% of the 8 and 24  flux ) likely arose from their adopted mid - ir colors and fluxes of c - agb stars . @xcite and",
    "@xcite assume that c - rich agb stars have an average @xmath47 $ ] color of @xmath48  mag , derived from galactic carbon stars observed in the mid - ir by @xcite .",
    "@xcite assume an average 24  flux derived from carbon stars observed with _",
    "spitzer _ in the magellanic clouds by @xcite .",
    "however , both the @xcite and @xcite samples are heavily biased towards the reddest x - agb stars and completely exclude the bulk of the c - agb population , which is much bluer .",
    "this issue is demonstrated in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : hist ] which plots histograms of the @xmath49 $ ] color of the tp - agb stars in the lmc . the color adopted by @xcite models",
    "is shown as a dashed line and is significantly redder than the bulk of the lmc c - agb stars . when including the complete samples of c - rich agb stars ( c - agb plus x - agb , red and green distributions respectively ) from the sage survey , we find @xmath50 \\rangle_{\\rm x + c } = 1.38 $ ]  mag in the smc and @xmath51  mag in the lmc ( dot - dot - dot - dashed line in figure [ fig : hist ] )",
    "this is over 4 magnitudes bluer than the kelson & holden models ( also used in * ? ? ?",
    "a similarly sized discrepancy is obtained when comparing the sage agb sample to the adopted 24  flux for agb stars in verley et al .",
    "these revised colors would result in a much smaller contribution of tp - agb stars at mid - ir wavelengths , as is seen figure  [ fig : agb ] for the magellanic clouds .    while some x - agb stars in the sage magellanic cloud sample do show colors as red as those used in the kelson & holden models , together they have an average color that is still 2 magnitudes bluer than the models , @xmath50 \\rangle_{\\rm x,\\ smc } = 3.25 $ ]  mag and @xmath50 \\rangle_{\\rm x,\\ lmc } = 3.41 $ ]  mag ( dot - dashed line in top panel of figure [ fig : hist ] ) .",
    "in addition , these x - agb stars contribute almost nothing to the k - band light of the magellanic clouds ( 1% or less ) .",
    "the bluer o - agb and c - agb stars produce roughly 20 times the @xmath6-band light of the x - agb stars .",
    "the kelson & holden models rely on the @xmath6-band flux to estimate the agb contribution at longer wavelengths , and they assume that the x - abg stars are contributing nearly 50% of the @xmath6-band light . because of these assumptions , they are likely significantly over - estimating the agb flux contribution at longer wavelengths .",
    "the contribution of tp - agb and rsg stars to the integrated fluxes of the magellanic clouds , varies with wavelength .",
    "we find that their combined contribution peaks between @xmath52  , where they contribute 32% of the smc flux and @xmath17% of the lmc flux . at 1.2  ,",
    "the contributions are smaller , @xmath53% and @xmath54% for the smc and lmc . at longer wavelengths",
    "the contributions also decline , but still constitute 19% of the 8  light of the smc ( only 4% for the lmc where warm dust and pah emission are stronger ) .",
    "the bulk of this 8  stellar flux is from the most dust - enshrouded agb stars , the so - called x - agb stars , which are predominantly carbon stars near the end of the agb phase . at 24",
    "the agb star contribution to the total flux is less than 3% for each galaxy .",
    "the flux contributions of the tp - agb and rsg are significant at 3.6  .",
    "thus , these stars have an impact on the m / l ratios of the magellanic clouds at near - ir wavelengths .",
    "because these stars are short - lived we can expect that the near - ir m / l ratios will also vary significantly over time . to minimize the impact of short lived tp - agb and rsg stars on stellar mass estimates of galaxies , shorter wavelength observations are preferred .",
    "however , at optical wavelengths , short - lived , super - luminous o and b stars play a similar role as the agb and rsg stars in the near - ir .",
    "we find that the optimal wavelengths for minimizing the impact of luminous short - lived stars on the m / l ratio of galaxies is between 0.8 and 1  .",
    "the non - negligible flux from the tp - agb at 8  suggests that star formation rates based on rest - frame 8  flux ( e.g.  24  imaging at @xmath2 ) may be biassed slightly high .",
    "however , this effect is most important for systems with little pah emission ( like the smc ) . for systems with significant warm dust and pah emission , the tp - agb contribution at 8  appears to be small , thus for the lmc the contribution is @xmath224% .",
    "special thanks to karl gordon for providing integrated fluxes of the lmc in the  bands , to caroline bot for sharing the sed and model fits of the magellanic clouds .",
    "thanks to gustavo bruzual for sharing updated ssp models of the magellanic clouds .",
    "we also want to thank barry madore , mark seibert , and wendy freedman for inspiring efforts to study the impact of agb stars on mid - infrared galaxy fluxes .",
