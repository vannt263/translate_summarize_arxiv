    "realistic quantum systems are affected by decoherence and entanglement losses because of the unavoidable interaction with their environments @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "for example , in markovian environments , in spite of an exponential decay of the single - qubit coherence , the entanglement between two qubits may completely disappear at a finite time @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "this phenomenon , known as entanglement sudden death and experimentally proven to occur @xmath2 $ ] , limits the time when entanglement can be exploited for practical purposes .",
    "so the issue of how to avoid or control entanglement sudden death - type decorrelation in a realistic physical system is especially important . up to now",
    ", several ways were proposed for keeping the atomic entanglement for a long time by suppressing spontaneous emission .",
    "one way widely applied is to place the qubits in a structured environment , say , microcavity @xmath3 $ ] or in the photonic band gap of photonic crystals @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "other methods considered use dynamic manipulation such as mode modulation @xmath5 $ ] or the quantum zeno effect @xmath6 $ ] , which can be regarded as extensions of the so - called bang - bang method @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "+ in this paper we focus on the entanglement dynamics of two qubits , each coupled to a non - markovian structured environment .",
    "we continue the investigation of physical effects that may control the occurrence time of entanglement sudden death , and find that the speed of disentanglement is closely related to qubit - pseudomode detuning and the spectrum of the reservoirs .",
    "in particular , we mainly consider two qubits respectively coupled to a bath of oscillators with a density of states described by a frequency dependent function @xmath8 . in some previous works",
    "@xmath9 $ ] , the spectrum of the structured reservoir is a lorentzian , which only give a single pseudomode to replace the effect of the structured reservoir",
    ". then the short - time behavior of the qubit system leads to exponential decay @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "however , if there are two or more poles close to the real @xmath11 axis , it is not clear that a simple picture of exponential decay will apply because the poles can interfere with each other .",
    "so we focus on the structured reservoir model of a band gap in which both lorentzians are centered at the same frequency , and the second is given a negative weighting in our paper , and make comparison with the model of the function @xmath8 has one lorentzian . +",
    "consider a model consisting of two qubits @xmath12 and @xmath13 , each interacting with a common zero - temperature bosonic reservoir , denoted @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "we assume that each qubit - reservoir system is isolated and the reservoirs are initially in the vacuum state while two qubits are initially in an entangled state .",
    "since each qubit evolves independently , we can learn how to characterize the evolution of the overall system from the qubit - reservoir dynamics .",
    "the interaction between a qubit and an @xmath16-mode reservoir is described through the hamiltonian ( under the rotating - wave approximation and setting @xmath17 ) @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 are the creation and annihilation operators of quanta of the reservoir ( @xmath14 or @xmath15 ) , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the inversion operators and transition frequency of the @xmath24-th qubit ( j=@xmath12 , @xmath13 and here @xmath25 ) ; @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the frequency of the mode @xmath28 of the reservoir and its coupling strength with the @xmath24-th qubit .",
    "+ let us consider the case when the j - th qubit is initially in the excited state and its corresponding reservoir is in the vacuum state .",
    "using the pseudomode method , we focus on an idealized model of a band gap ( or photon density of states gap ) in which both lorentzians are centered at the same frequency , and the second is given a negative weighting , so that @xmath29 $ ] @xmath30 where now the weights of the two lorentzians are such that @xmath31 and @xmath32 ensure positivity of @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath34 is the center of the spectrum , and @xmath35 , @xmath36 are the full width at half maximum of two lorentzians , respectively .",
    "the effect of the lorentzian with negative weight is to introduce a dip into the density of states function @xmath8 where the coupling of the qubit will be inhibited @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "the two poles in @xmath33 are located at @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and there is a change in sign of the residues of @xmath33 between these poles . the exact pseudomode master equation associated with the density of states gap in eq.@xmath40 is given by @xmath41-\\frac{\\gamma'_{1}}{2}[a^{\\dag}_{1}a_{1}\\rho-2a_{1}{\\rho}a^{\\dag}_{1}+{\\rho}a^{\\dag}_{1}a_{1}]\\nonumber\\\\ & -&\\frac{\\gamma'_{2}}{2}[a^{\\dag}_{2}a_{2}\\rho-2a_{2}{\\rho}a^{\\dag}_{2}+{\\rho}a^{\\dag}_{2}a_{2}],\\label{03}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42\\nonumber\\\\ & + & v(a^{\\dag}_{1}a_{2}+a_{1}a^{\\dag}_{2 } ) , \\label{04}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the density operator for the j - th qubit and the pseudomodes of its corresponding reservoir ; and @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the annihilation operators of the two pseudomodes decaying with deacy rates @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively .",
    "the two pseudomodes are coupled and @xmath48 is the strength of the coupling .",
    "the qubit interacts coherently with the second pseudomode ( the strength of the coupling @xmath49 ) , which is in turn coupled to the first one .",
    "both pseudomodes are leaking into independent markovian reservoirs .",
    "the set of ordinary differential equations associated to the master equation @xmath50 is @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 are the complex amplitudes for the states with one excitation in the qubit , one excitation in the first pseudomode , and one excitation in the second pseudomode , respectively",
    ". the positions of the true poles are @xmath55 and @xmath56 . due to the initial state of the j - th qubit and its corresponding",
    "reservoir is @xmath57 ( with the state @xmath58 ) , then @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , so we can acquire the exact solutions ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) of the differential equations ( [ 05 ] ) easily through a computer program . +",
    "according to the differential equations ( [ 05 ] ) , for an initial state of the form @xmath61 where @xmath62 , @xmath63 are real , then the time evolution of the total system is ( using the above pseudomode method ) @xmath64 with @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 mean the structured reservoir @xmath14 or @xmath15 states with no excitation in two pseudomodes , only one excitation in the first pseudomode , and one excitation in the second pseudomode , respectively .",
    "then we can determine the two qubits dynamics .",
    "in particular , in the standard two qubits basis @xmath68 result as @xmath69 we use the concurrence @xmath70 @xmath71 $ ] , which attains its maximum value @xmath72 for maximally entangled states and vanishes for separable states , to analyze the two - qubit entanglement dynamics . for @xmath73 ,",

    ", we mainly investigate that the speed of the occurrence of entanglement sudden death is related to the spectrum of the reservoirs ( @xmath36 ) and the qubit - pseudomode detuning ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "+ first we study the relation between the entanglement sudden death and the spectrum of the reservoirs .",
    "fig.@xmath72 shows the entanglement dynamics of two qubits in the non - markovian weak - coupling regime with @xmath78 .",
    "we compare the entanglement dynamics of the two qubits for three different values of the width of the second lorentzian spectral function , namely , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 . as in fig.@xmath82 ,",
    "the qubits are on resonance with the center of the spectrum , @xmath83 .",
    "the concurrence decreases monotonically down to zero in a finite time .",
    "it is interesting to find that the speed of occurrence of entanglement sudden death can increase with @xmath36 increasing .",
    "similar behavior happens when two qubits are near resonance with the center of the spectrum .",
    "however , when the qubits are far off - resonant with the center of the spectrum , @xmath84 , as shown in fig.@xmath85 , where we choose @xmath86 , the speed of occurrence of entanglement sudden death decreases as @xmath36 increases .",
    "we can give an intuitive explanation for these results .",
    "as we can see in fig.@xmath87 , the density of the spectrum @xmath8 increases monotonically as @xmath36 increases for @xmath83 , while the density of the spectrum @xmath8 decreases monotonically as @xmath36 increases when @xmath86 .",
    "it is proved that the entanglement sudden death is determined by the modes of the spectrum which are on resonance with the qubits : the speed of the occurrence of entanglement sudden death decreases ( increases ) as the density of these modes decreases ( increases ) .",
    "+    time evolution of the concurrence of two qubits as a function of the dimensionless quantity @xmath88 in non - markovian weak - coupling regime , with ( a ) @xmath83 and ( b ) @xmath86 . for the cases of ( i )",

    "if the structured reservoir only contains a lorentzian ( @xmath98 ) , from the ref.@xmath99 $ ] , we note that the speed of disentanglement decreases as the width of the lorentzian spectral ( @xmath35 is replaced by @xmath100 in ref.@xmath99 $ ] ) increases on / near the resonant couplings , and the speed of disentanglement increases as @xmath100 increases for large deduning coupling .",
    "however , in our paper the density of the spectrum @xmath8 is composed by two lorentzians , and the second is given a negative weighting .",
    "then the counter results can be acquired when we consider the width of the second lorentzian spectral @xmath36 influence the speed of the occurrence of entanglement sudden death . that is to say , @xmath35 and @xmath36 have the opposite effects on the speed of the occurrence of entanglement sudden death .",
    "so we can keep two - qubit entanglement for a long time trough choosing suitable spectrum of the reservoirs .",
    "+ as we know , the effect of the lorentzian with negative weight is to introduce a dip into the density of states function @xmath8 . for a perfect gap , where @xmath101 , we would also have @xmath102 , then the single - qubit excited - state population trapping can occurs @xmath10 $ ] . according to ref.@xmath103 $ ]",
    ", we can find that there is a direct link between the time - dependent entanglement and single - qubit excited - state population for independent qubits , each coupled to a zero - temperature bosonic environment .",
    "so there also will appear two - qubit entanglement trapping if the qubits are resonant with the gap in our paper .",
    "but it is surprising to see that the entanglement trapping only can occur in the weak - coupling regime , and entanglement sudden death still appears quickly in the intermediate - coupling regime and strong - coupling regime . for the intermediate - coupling regime ,",
    "the two - qubit entanglement can vanish forever .",
    "due to the strong non - markovian effects , the entanglement of the two qubits can arise the phenomenon of entanglement sudden death and revival in the strong - coupling regime ( as shown in fig.@xmath104 ) .",

    "a comparison between fig.@xmath108 and fig.@xmath109 reveals that , both for the weak - coupling regime , the speed of the occurrence of entanglement sudden death only can decrease as @xmath105 increases in the one lorentzian model .",

    "we have brought to light new relations between the speed of the occurrence of entanglement sudden death and the spectrum of the reservoirs / the qubit - pseudomode detuning for qubits prepared in entangled state .",
    "we firstly find that the speed of occurrence of entanglement sudden death is a increasing ( decreasing ) function of the width of the second lorentzian spectral @xmath36 when the qubits are on / near resonance ( large detuning ) with the pseudomodes of the reservoirs . due to the density of the spectrum @xmath8",
