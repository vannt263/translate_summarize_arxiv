    "with the discovery of the higgs - like scalar at the cern lhc , the standard model higgs mechanism for spontaneous breaking of the @xmath2 gauge symmetry appears to be a correct description of the nature .",
    "in addition to explaining the spontaneous breaking of the electroweak symmetry , the higgs boson is also responsible for the origin of fermion masses , via the yukawa interactions . on the other hand ,",
    "the minimal higgs mechanism is not able to address the the fermion mass hierarchy problem , where the quark - lepton masses range from the top quark with mass of order electroweak scale , @xmath3 , down to electron of mass , @xmath4 mev , and the first order phase transition , relevant for baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "more precise measurement of higgs boson properties will help determine whether there are new degrees of freedom that participate in electroweak symmetry breaking or otherwise involve in new higgs boson interactions .",
    "furthermore , the discovery of the neutrino oscillation has confirmed the theoretical expectation that neutrinos are massive and lepton flavors are mixed  @xcite , which provided the first piece of evidence for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . in order to accommodate the tiny neutrino masses , one can extend the sm by introducing several right - handed neutrinos , which are taken to be singlets under the @xmath5 gauge group . in this case , the gauge invariance allows right - handed neutrinos to have majorana mass @xmath6 , which is not subject to the electroweak symmetry breaking scale .",
    "thus the effective mass matrix of three light majorana neutrinos can be highly suppressed if @xmath6 is much larger than the electroweak scale , which is the so - called canonical seesaw mechanism  @xcite .",
    "two other types of tree - level seesaw mechanisms have also been proposed  @xcite . despite its simplicity and elegance , the canonical seesaw mechanism is impossible to be tested in current collider experiments , especially at the large hadron collider , due to its inaccessibly high right - handed majorana mass scale .",
    "heavy majorana neutrinos can also give large radiative corrections to the sm higgs mass , which causes the seesaw hierarchy problem  @xcite .",
    "an alternative way to generate tiny majorana neutrino masses at the tev scale is the inverse seesaw mechanism  @xcite , in which the neutrino mass @xmath7 is proportional to a small effecitive majorana mass term @xmath8 .",
    "but there is no dynamical explanation of the smallness of @xmath8 .",
    "the argument is that neutrinos become massless in the limit of vanishing @xmath8 and the global lepton number , @xmath9 , is then restored , leading to a larger symmetry @xcite . this argument , however , only works when we give the left - handed singlets ( @xmath10 ) the same quantum(lepton ) number as that of the right - handed heavy neutrinos ( @xmath11 ) . if the lepton number of @xmath12 is zero , the argument above does not hold up any more .",
    "besides , the lepton number is only an accidental symmetry of the sm and is explicitly broken by anomalies .",
    "since neutrino is the only neutral matter field in the sm , it is reasonable to conjecture that neutrinos are correlated with the dark matter , which provides another evidence of the new physics beyond the sm from the precise cosmological observations , through certain dark symmetry .",
    "the nature of the dark matter and the way it interacts with ordinary matter are still mysteries .",
    "the discovery of the higgs boson opens up new ways of probing the world of the dark matter .",
    "the neutrino flux from the annihilation of the dark matter at the center of the dark matter halo also provides a way of indirect detecting the dark matter .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a possible explanation of the smallness of neutrino masses and a possible candidate of the dark matter .",
    "the discovery of the higgs - like boson makes the higgs mechanism more promising as a possible way to understand the origin of the fermion masses .",
    "we study the possibility of generating a small majorana mass term with the help of the seesaw mechanism in the higgs sector .",
    "we extend the sm with a local @xmath0 gauge symmetry , which is spontaneously broken by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath13 of an extra scalar singlet .",
    "furthermore there is a seesaw mechanism in the scalar singlet sector : a second scalar singlet gets a tiny vev @xmath14 in a way similar to that of the higgs triplet in the type - ii seesaw model  @xcite .",
    "@xmath15 is responsible for the origin of the dark matter mass and the dirac neutrino mass term , while @xmath16 is responsible for the origin of a small majorana neutrino mass term .",
    "the active neutrino mass matrix arises from the modified inverse seesaw mechanism .",
    "a crucial feature of our model is that all the mass terms originate from the spontaneous breaking of local gauge symmetries , and dark matter is correlated with the neutrino physics via the @xmath0 gauge symmetry .",
    "we study constraints on the parameter space of this model from astrophysical observation and dark matter direct detections .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we describe our model , including the full lagrangian , higgs vevs and mass spectrum . in section iii",
    "we study the neutrino masses and the effective lepton mixing matrix of the model .",
    "section iv is devoted to the study of the dark matter phenomenology .",
    "we summarize in section v.",
    "we extend the sm with three generations of right - handed neutrinos @xmath17 and singlets @xmath18 as in the inverse seesaw mechanism , together with two extra scalar singlets , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , as well as a spontaneously broken @xmath0 gauge symmetry and a global @xmath21 flavor symmetry .",
    "the quantum numbers of the fields are given in table  [ tab : qn ] , where @xmath22 is left - handed lepton doublet , @xmath23 is the right - handed charged lepton , @xmath24 is the sm higgs doublet , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the fermion singlet pair carrying the same @xmath21 quantum number .",
    "three generations of gauge singlets @xmath27 are needed to cancel anomalies  @xcite of the @xmath0 gauge symmetry .",
    "the lightest generation of @xmath27 is stable due to the global @xmath21 flavor symmetry and thus plays the role of dark matter  @xcite .    .",
    "quantum numbers of the relevant fields under the local @xmath0 and the global @xmath21 flavor symmetry . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we show in the left panel of fig.[fig : l3contour ] the contour plot of @xmath28 as a function of @xmath29 with @xmath30 gev .",

    "the dark matter relic abundance for @xmath38 will be too big to be consistent with the observation . for @xmath39 ,",
    "the dominant channels are @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "when @xmath42 gets even bigger , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are no longer kinematically forbidden and becomes the dominant annihilation channel . while for @xmath45 , @xmath46 becomes the dominate annihilation channel of the dark matter .",
    "for the two examples shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmrelic ] , the model on the left panel has too big an annihilation cross section which is excluded and the one on the right will produce the right amount of dark matter given @xmath47 .",
    "dark matter is also constrained by direct detection experiments such as lux  @xcite and xenon 100@xcite . the dark matter -quark interactions in the effective models naturally induce the dark matter - nucleus interactions .",
    "the effective hamiltonian in our model can be written as @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 . parameterizing the nucleonic matrix element as @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the proton or neutron mass and @xmath53 are the nucleon form factors .",

    "the cross section for the dm scattering elastically from a nucleus is given by @xmath55 ^ 2 [ z m_p f^p + ( a - z ) m_n f^n ] ^2 \\label{dmnucl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the reduced mass of the wimp - nucleon system , with @xmath52 the target nucleus mass .",

    "[ fig : sigma ] shows the spin - independent nucleon direct detection cross section as a function of the dark matter mass , where the blue and black points are models with @xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively .",
    "the red solid line is the lux limit .",
    "one can see from ( [ dmnucl ] ) that the scattering cross section is sensitive to @xmath28 , which determines the mixing angle , @xmath61 , between the sm - like higgs and the heavier scalar singlet .",

    "constraints on the model parameter space from dark matter relic density as well as dark matter direct searches are studied .",
