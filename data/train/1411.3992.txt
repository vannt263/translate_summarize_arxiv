    ", something even more remarkable happens .",
    "first of all , @xmath77 is the imaginary part of a holomorphic vector field , and so the flow of @xmath78 preserves @xmath32 . at the same time",
    ", @xmath78 is the symplectic gradient of a function , so its flow also preserves the khler form @xmath16 .",

    ", @xmath80 is a killing field whenever @xmath74 is a real holomorphy potential , and this assumption on a real - valued function @xmath74 is equivalent to requiring that @xmath76 be a @xmath32-invariant symmetric tensor .",

    "let @xmath81 , and let @xmath51 be the ( possibly empty ) open set where @xmath82 .",
    "then @xmath83 is a khler metric on @xmath51 , and @xmath74 is a real holomorphy potential on @xmath84 , possessing the additional property that @xmath37 has constant scalar curvature .    on a hermitian surface ,",
    "the @xmath32-invariant @xmath4-forms are given by @xmath85 so the self - dual part @xmath29 of any @xmath32-invariant @xmath4-form @xmath5 is a function times the associated @xmath4-form @xmath86 of our metric .",
    "if , near any point where @xmath29 is non - zero , we rescale our hermitian metric so as to give it pointwise norm @xmath55 , then , the self - dual @xmath4-form @xmath87 is the associated @xmath4-form of a new metric @xmath9 which is conformal to @xmath3 ; and if @xmath29 is closed , the resulting metric @xmath9 is then khler .",
    "this is exactly realized by setting @xmath83 .",

    "this ansatz thus solves ( [ self][matter ] ) iff is satisfied , and therefore solves ( [ closed][energy ] ) iff @xmath3 has constant scalar curvature .",
    "the main worry aroused by the results in the previous section is that the construction breaks down at the zero locus of the @xmath4-form @xmath29 .",
    "fortunately , however , this worry turns out to be largely misplaced . to get around this problem",
    ", we will develop a sequence of lemmata inspired by an argument of derdziski @xcite , now carefully implemented by using a fundamental result on zero sets of generalized harmonic spinors due to br @xcite . to do the job properly , we begin with a regularity result :    [ regular ] let @xmath21 be a solution of the einstein - maxwell equations ( [ closed][energy ] ) on a smooth @xmath0-manifold @xmath2 .",
    "suppose that , in some coordinate atlas , @xmath3 is of class @xmath105 for some @xmath106 , and that @xmath5 is of class @xmath107 . then @xmath3 and @xmath5 are @xmath108 in harmonic coordinates .    by the results of deturck and kazdan @xcite , we can pass to harmonic coordinates without losing any regularity , and if , in harmonic coordinates , @xmath3 is of class @xmath109 , with ricci tensor @xmath8 of class @xmath109 , then @xmath3 is actually of class @xmath110 . on the other hand ,",
    "since @xmath5 is in the kernel of @xmath111 , elliptic regularity @xcite implies that if @xmath3 is of class @xmath109 , then @xmath5 is of class @xmath109 , too .",

    "thus , if @xmath3 is of class @xmath109 , @xmath8 is also of class @xmath109 , so @xmath3 is actually @xmath110 .",
    "it therefore follows by induction ( `` bootstrapping '' ) that @xmath3 and @xmath5 are both smooth in harmonic coordinates .",
    "in particular , the implicit assumption of smoothness used throughout  [ overture ] can now be seen to have been perfectly justified .",
    "next , we will establish a technical lemma of key importance .",
    "[ extend ] let @xmath114 be a @xmath115 riemannian @xmath116-manifold , and let @xmath117 be a closed subset of hausdorff dimension @xmath118 .",
    "let @xmath119 be the complement of @xmath120 , and suppose that @xmath78 is a killing field on @xmath121 .",
    "then @xmath78 extends to @xmath114 as a killing vector field @xmath122 .",
    "let @xmath123 be any point , and let @xmath124 be a geodesically convex neighborhood of @xmath125 . since @xmath120 has @xmath116-dimensional measure zero , it has empty interior , and it follows that @xmath126 is non - empty .",
    "thus , there exists some @xmath127 which belongs to the complement @xmath51 of @xmath120 ; and since @xmath120 is closed , some small metric ball @xmath128 is also contained in @xmath126",
    ". let @xmath129 be the unit sphere in @xmath130 , and let @xmath131 be the @xmath132 map which sends @xmath133 to the initial unit tangent vector of the geodesic segment @xmath134 .",
    "since @xmath135 is lipschitz , the hausdorff dimension of @xmath136 is also @xmath118 , so almost every geodesic through @xmath137 misses @xmath120 .",
    "now recall that the restriction of a killing field @xmath78 to any geodesic @xmath138 solves jacobi s equation , since the flow of @xmath78 sends @xmath138 to a family of geodesics .",
    "let us therefore define a @xmath107 vector field @xmath122 on @xmath139 , as the unique family of solutions of jacobi s equation along geodesics radiating from @xmath137 , with the same initial values and initial ( radial ) derivatives as @xmath78 along the sphere @xmath140 .",
    "then @xmath78 and @xmath122 are both @xmath107 on @xmath141 , and agree on @xmath142 , where @xmath143 is the union of all the geodesics radiating from @xmath137 which miss @xmath144 .",
    "however , @xmath142 is dense in @xmath141 , since its complement @xmath145 $ ] is of @xmath116-dimensional measure zero . because two continuous vector fields on @xmath141 which agree on a dense set must be equal",
    ", it follows that @xmath146 on @xmath147 .",
    "we can therefore extend @xmath78 across @xmath120 as @xmath122 , and extend @xmath122 across @xmath137 as @xmath78 .",
    "moreover , since the @xmath107 vector field @xmath122 solves killing s equation on the open dense set @xmath147 where it coincides with @xmath78 , it actually solves killing s equation everywhere .",
    "finally , since the intersection of two geodesically convex sets is geodesically convex , any two such local extension of @xmath78 across @xmath120 agree on the overlap , and we can therefore consistently extend @xmath78 to @xmath2 as a killing field @xmath122 .",
    "the above argument also establishes a minor noteworthy point :    [ path ] let @xmath144 be a smooth connected @xmath116-manifold , and let @xmath117 be a closed subset of hausdorff dimension @xmath118 .",
    "then @xmath148 is path connected .",
    "moreover , for any metric @xmath3 on @xmath144 , the riemannian distance in @xmath149 is just the restriction of the riemannian distance from @xmath114 .",
    "it suffices to prove to prove the statement when @xmath3 is smooth , as the general case then follows by quasi - isometric pinching . in any small geodesically convex ball @xmath150 ,",
    "a dense set of points of @xmath126 can be reached from any @xmath151 by following distance - minimizing geodesics that avoid @xmath120 .",
    "we can therefore reach any @xmath152 from @xmath151 by following broken geodesic paths @xmath153 in @xmath126 , where @xmath154 , and , as @xmath155 , the lengths of such paths approach the riemannian distance from @xmath137 to @xmath125 in @xmath144 .",
    "any piecewise geodesic path in @xmath144 joining two points in @xmath148 can therefore be approximated by piecewise geodesic paths in @xmath148 of essentially the same length .",
    "[ tip ] let @xmath156 , @xmath157 , be a hermitian manifold with @xmath32-invariant ricci tensor , and suppose that @xmath74 is a continuous non - negative function such that @xmath83 is a khler metric on the open subset @xmath51 where @xmath74 is non - zero .",
    "relative to the complex coordinate atlas , assume that @xmath74 is at least @xmath132 on @xmath51 , and that @xmath3 is at least @xmath115 in some @xmath132-compatible coordinate atlas for @xmath2 .",
    "suppose , moreover , that @xmath158 has hausdorff dimension @xmath118 .",
    "then @xmath159 , @xmath74 is everywhere positive , and @xmath160 is globally conformally khler .",
    "the trace - free ricci tensors of the conformally related metrics @xmath3 and @xmath9 are related @xcite by @xmath161 where the trace - free hessian of @xmath74 is computed with respect to @xmath9 .",
    "since the ricci tensors of both metrics are @xmath32-invariant , it follows that the component of @xmath76 in @xmath72 vanishes , so that @xmath74 is a real holomorphy potential on @xmath84 , and its symplectic gradient @xmath162 is therefore a killing field .",
    "however , @xmath163 , so the flow of @xmath78 preserves not only @xmath9 , but also @xmath37 ; that is , @xmath78 is a killing field for @xmath3 , defined on the complement of a closed set @xmath120 of hausdorff dimension @xmath118 .",
    "thus @xmath78 extends across @xmath120 as a killing field by lemma [ extend ] , and the vector field @xmath164 therefore extends across @xmath120 , too .",
    "however , @xmath165 , so , by lowering an index , it follows that the @xmath166-form @xmath167 extends across @xmath120 as a @xmath166-form @xmath168 which is at least @xmath107 . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath166-form @xmath169 satisfies @xmath170 on open the dense set @xmath49 , so @xmath171 . if @xmath150 is a geodesically convex neighborhood of some @xmath172 , the poincar lemma therefore tells us that @xmath173 for some @xmath132 function @xmath174 on @xmath150 , since @xmath150 is contractible . on the other hand , lemma [ path ]",
    "guarantees that @xmath126 is path connected .",
    "however , @xmath175 on @xmath176 , and since @xmath126 is connected , it follows that @xmath177 is constant .",
    "thus @xmath178 extends across @xmath123 as @xmath179 .",
    "however , since @xmath180 , this is a contradiction . we are therefore forced to conclude that @xmath181 , and that @xmath41 on all of @xmath2 . in particular , @xmath37 is globally conformally khler .",
    "we are now ready to prove our first main results .",
    "let @xmath21 be a strongly hermitian solution of the einstein - maxwell equations on a complex surface @xmath31 , and assume that @xmath3 is _ not _ einstein .",
    "also , for some @xmath106 , suppose that @xmath3 is of differentiability class @xmath105 and that @xmath5 is at least @xmath107 , relative to the complex atlas of @xmath33 .",
    "then there is a @xmath108 khler metric @xmath9 on @xmath33 and a @xmath108 positive holomorphy potential @xmath74 on @xmath36 such that @xmath37 , and such that @xmath29 is a constant times the khler form @xmath16 of @xmath9 .",
    "first notice that @xmath3 is smooth in harmonic coordinates by proposition [ regular ] , and we can therefore invoke the work of br @xcite .",
    "the self - dual @xmath4-form @xmath29 is in the kernel of the dirac - type operator @xmath111 on @xmath48 , and can not be identically zero , because otherwise would force @xmath3 to be einstein , contrary to our assumptions .",
    "thus br s theorem @xcite asserts that the zero locus @xmath120 of @xmath29 has hausdorff codimension @xmath182 .",
    "it follows that @xmath81 and @xmath83 fulfill the hypotheses of lemma [ tip ] , since elliptic regularity guarantees that @xmath5 is at least @xmath105 in complex coordinates .",
    "hence @xmath183 is empty , and @xmath48 is globally conformally khler , with @xmath37 for a khler metric @xmath9 and a positive holomorphy potential @xmath74 .",
    "it only remains to show that @xmath9 and @xmath74 are actually smooth with respect to the complex coordinate atlas of @xmath33 . to this end , first notice that @xmath3 and @xmath184 are smooth in the harmonic coordinate atlas for @xmath3 by proposition [ regular ] .",
    "it follows that @xmath83 is smooth in these coordinates , too .",
    "elliptic regularity thus implies that any function that is harmonic with respect to @xmath9 is also smooth with respect to harmonic coordinates for @xmath3 .",
    "however , the real and imaginary parts of any local holomorphic function are harmonic with respect to any khler metric .",
    "since @xmath9 is khler , to follows that the complex coordinate atlas of @xmath33 defines the same @xmath108 structure as the harmonic atlas of @xmath3 .    to prove theorems [ clef ] and [ alto ]",
    ", it thus suffices to address the case in which @xmath3 is einstein .",
    "however , this case follows @xcite from the work of derdziski @xcite , together with the riemannian goldberg - sachs theorem @xcite and results of boyer @xcite on compact anti - self - dual hermitian manifolds . here",
    "one of derdziski s important discoveries is that @xmath185 is either nowhere zero or must vanish identically .",
    "we note in passing that lemma [ tip ] , with @xmath186 , also provides a clear and watertight way of establishing this point .",
    "indeed , the equation @xmath187 is also of generalized dirac type , so br s theorem once again implies that the zero locus of @xmath185 has hausdorff codimension @xmath182 on any non - anti - self - dual einstein @xmath0-manifold .",
    "let us now construct some compact , non - khler examples of strongly hermitian solutions of the einstein - maxwell equations . to do this",
    ", we will look for khler metrics @xmath9 on a product @xmath188 , together with positive holomorphy potentials @xmath74 such that @xmath37 has constant scalar curvature . for simplicity",
    ", we will take @xmath9 to be the riemannian product of an axisymmetric metric on @xmath189 with a metric of constant scalar curvature @xmath190 on @xmath191 , and we will take our holomorphy potential @xmath74 to be the hamiltonian for rotation of @xmath192 about the given axis , with period @xmath193 .",
    "thus , @xmath194 where @xmath195 has constant scalar curvature @xmath196 , and where the metric @xmath197 on @xmath192 can be written in cylindrical coordinates @xmath198 $ ] as @xmath199 for some smooth positive function @xmath200 . here we have put the khler form @xmath201 in darboux coordinates , so that we may assume that our holomorphy potential is given by @xmath202 as long as we remember to insist that @xmath203 .",
    "the scalar curvature of @xmath9 is then given by @xmath204 thus the scalar curvature of @xmath9 is given by @xmath205 we now want to arrange that @xmath37 has constant scalar curvature , which is to say that @xmath206 for a constant @xmath207 .",
    "we may now rewrite this as @xmath208 or in other words , as @xmath209 since the hessian of @xmath202 is trivial in the @xmath191-directions of our riemannian product . since @xmath210 the yamabe equation therefore reduces to the ode @xmath211 or equivalently",
    "@xmath212 since the linear operator @xmath213 acts on monomials by @xmath214 the general solution of equation is therefore a quartic polynomial @xmath215 with @xmath216 .",
    "now , in order to get a metric on @xmath192 , we need to impose the boundary conditions that @xmath217 while remembering that we also must have @xmath218 and @xmath219 on @xmath220 ; for example , if we set @xmath221 , these conditions guarantee that the metric takes the form @xmath222 for small positive @xmath223 . for @xmath224 ,",
    "the unique such quartic polynomial is given by        @xmath225 ~.\\ ] ]    one can then read off that @xmath226 and that @xmath227 in particular , the constant scalar curvature @xmath190 of @xmath191 must be positive , so @xmath191 must be a @xmath4-sphere @xmath43 .",
    "gauss - bonnet moreover guarantees that the total area of @xmath191 must be @xmath228 by contrast , the total area of @xmath229 is @xmath230 .",
    "thus , we have constructed a khler metric @xmath231 on @xmath232 which is not locally symmetric , but engenders a solution @xmath233 of positive scalar curvature @xmath234 , and belongs to the khler class @xmath235 = 4\\pi ( b - a ) \\left ( \\mathfrak{s}_2 + \\frac{b / a}{(1+b / a)^2}\\mathfrak{s}_1 \\right)\\in h^2(\\cp_1\\times \\cp_1),\\ ] ] where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the poincar duals of the first and second factors of @xmath232 . as we allow @xmath203 to vary , these sweep out all the khler classes for which the second factor has less than one - quarter the area of the first factor . in particular , the constant - scalar - curvature khler metric in such a class @xmath236 $ ] , obtained by taking the riemannian product of round @xmath4-spheres of appropriate radii , is not the only khler metric in @xmath236 $ ] that engenders a solution of the einstein - maxwell equations .",
    "the solutions @xmath21 so engendered are moreover geometrically distinct ; one family of solutions consists of symmetric spaces , whereas the metrics in the other family are not even locally symmetric .",
    "theorem [ behold ] now follows .",
    "we have just seen that not every strongly hermitian einstein - maxwell solution on a compact complex surface is given by a csck metric .",
    "this presents us with the intriguing problem of determining when such non - khler solutions exist .",
    "one hint is provided by the following easy result :    [ rule ] let @xmath21 be a strongly hermitian solution of the einstein - maxwell equations ( [ closed][energy ] ) on a compact complex surface @xmath31 . then either @xmath3 is a constant - scalar - curvature khler metric , or else @xmath33 is a rational or ruled surface .",
    "if the holomorphy potential @xmath74 is non - constant , @xmath237 is a non - trivial killing field for @xmath9 .",
    "the flow of @xmath78 is then a connected abelian group of isometries of @xmath238 , the closure of which is a torus subgroup of the isometry group which acts on @xmath2 with non - empty fixed - point set .",
    "however , the generators are also the real parts of holomorphic vector fields .",
    "if this torus has dimension @xmath239 , one gets a non - trivial holomorphic section of @xmath240 with non - empty zero locus by taking the wedge product of two independent holomorphic vector fields associated with the action .",
    "otherwise , @xmath78 is a periodic vector field , and we obtain an embedded rational curve of non - negative self - intersection by taking the closure of generic orbit of the group generated by @xmath78 and @xmath241 . either way , it follows that the plurigenra @xmath242 , @xmath243 , must all vanish , and , since @xmath33 also admits a khler metric @xmath9 , surface classification @xcite tells us @xmath33 is rational or ruled .    of course ,",
    "the einstein hermitian metrics @xcite on @xmath244 and @xmath245 provide two more examples , so it seems certain that the full story will turn out to be rich and interesting .",
    "but there is obviously an enormous gulf between the minuscule menagerie of currently known examples and the world of possibilities allowed by proposition [ rule ] .",
    "i can only hope that some interested reader will feel motivated to construct some further examples !",
    "the examples constructed in  [ construct ] have an intriguing feature that is also worth mentioning here .",
    "the constructed metrics @xmath3 of course all have constant scalar curvature .",
    "the question is , which of them , if any , are _",
    "yamabe metrics_. recall that yamabe s program for proving the existence of constant - scalar - curvature metrics on compact manifolds involves _ minimizing _ the functional ( or the appropriate @xmath116-dimensional generalization ) in any given conformal class ; such metrics always exist @xcite , and are called yamabe metrics .",
    "but while every yamabe metric has constant scalar curvature , not every constant - scalar - curvature metric is yamabe .",
    "this complication only occurs when the scalar curvature is positive , as is the case for the examples in question . for precisely this reason",
    ", the _ yamabe invariant _ of @xmath0-manifolds like @xmath246 remains unknown . here",
    ", the yamabe invariant @xmath247 of a @xmath0-manifold is obtained by by taking the infimum of in each conformal class , and then taking the supremum of these infima over all conformal classes ; equivalently , it is the supremum of the scalar curvatures of all unit - volume yamabe metrics on @xmath2 .",
    "what is currently known @xcite strongly suggests that one should have @xmath248 but here , for the moment , the lower bound is merely conjectural . on the other hand , the value of the functional is easy to compute for the constructed metrics @xmath249 on @xmath232 ; namely , since the scalar curvature @xmath250 is exactly the constant @xmath251",
    ", one can easily show that @xmath252 intriguingly , as @xmath253 ranges over the interval @xmath254 , this exactly sweeps out the interval @xmath255 in question .",
    "thus , if any of these metrics is yamabe , the conjectural lower bound would be established ; and if they are _ all _ yamabe , the upper bound would be saturated !",

    "<S> while relativists understand these equations as the euler - lagrange equations of a suitable lagrangian , it was pointed out in @xcite that they also arise from a non - traditional variational problem that , while apparently unfamiliar to physicists , is of immediate interest in riemannian geometry . indeed , suppose that @xmath13 is compact , let @xmath14\\in h^2(m,\\rr)$ ] be a fixed cohomology class with @xmath14 ^ 2 > 0 $ ] , and let @xmath15}$ ] be the frchet manifold of smooth riemannian metrics @xmath9 on @xmath2 for which the harmonic representative @xmath16 of @xmath14 $ ] is self - dual with respect to the relevant metric @xmath9 . letting @xmath17 denote the scalar curvature of a riemannian metric , we can then consider the _ einstein - hilbert functional </S>",

    "<S> similarly , the critical points of the calabi - type functional @xmath22 on @xmath15}$ ] are either einstein - maxwell or scalar - flat .    </S>",
    "<S> it is now worth emphasizing that equations ( [ closed][energy ] ) imply that the scalar curvature of @xmath3 is constant . indeed , </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath2 is compact , this can be deduced from the fact that if @xmath3 belongs to @xmath15}$ ] , so does its entire conformal class ; and the restriction of to a conformal class is exactly the functional used in the yamabe problem to identify metrics of constant scalar curvature . however , this fact about ( [ closed][energy ] ) can also be inferred directly , via a local calculation . indeed , a contraction of the second bianchi identity tells us that @xmath23 in dimension @xmath0 , where @xmath24 is the trace - free ricci tensor , and where @xmath17 is the scalar curvature . on the other hand , can be rewritten as @xmath25 where @xmath26 $ ] denotes the self - dual or anti - self - dual part of @xmath5 , depending on the sign . </S>",
    "<S> but , as we shall see in  [ overture ] below , @xmath27 and it therefore follows that @xmath28 if @xmath29 and @xmath30 are both co - closed </S>",
    "<S> . the latter stipulation is of course exactly equivalent to equations ( [ closed][coclosed ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the author s main point in @xcite was that constant - scalar - curvature khler ( csck ) metrics on complex surfaces @xmath31 can be considered as solutions of the einstein - maxwell equations ; moreover , when @xmath2 is compact and the scalar curvature is non - positive , such solutions are actually _ minima _ of on @xmath15}$ ] , rather than just critical points .    </S>",
    "<S> this article , however , will focus on another class of solutions , suggested by a recent paper of apostolov , calderbank and gauduchon @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we begin with a definition that is ostensibly much weaker than theirs :    let @xmath32 be an integrable almost - complex structure on @xmath2 , thus making @xmath31 into a complex surface . </S>",
    "<S> we will say that a solution @xmath21 of the einstein - maxwell equations ( [ closed][energy ] ) on @xmath33 is _ strongly hermitian _ if @xmath3 and @xmath5 are both invariant under the action of @xmath32 : @xmath34    our first main result , proved in  </S>",
    "<S> [ scenario ] below , asserts that , aside from a well - understood exceptional case , solutions of this type are in fact _ globally _ of the type studied locally by apostolov - calderbank - gauduchon @xcite :    [ clef ] let @xmath21 be a strongly hermitian solution of the einstein - maxwell equations on a ( connected ) complex surface @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> then either @xmath3 is einstein and anti - self - dual , or else there is a @xmath32-compatible khler metric @xmath9 on @xmath2 and a real holomorphy potential @xmath35 on @xmath36 such that @xmath37 has constant scalar curvature , and such that @xmath29 is a constant times the khler form @xmath16 of @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , if @xmath38 is a khler manifold and if @xmath39 is a real holomorphy potential such that @xmath37 has constant scalar curvature , then there is a unique harmonic @xmath4-form @xmath5 on @xmath2 with @xmath40 such that @xmath21 solves the einstein - maxwell equations .    </S>",
    "<S> the above result does not require that @xmath2 be compact , or that @xmath3 be complete . </S>",
    "<S> however , the statement can be simplified in the compact case :    [ alto ] let @xmath21 be a strongly hermitian solution of the einstein - maxwell equations on a compact complex surface @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> then there is a khler metric @xmath9 on @xmath33 , together with a holomorphy potential @xmath41 such that @xmath37 , and such that @xmath29 is a constant times the khler form @xmath16 of @xmath9 .    </S>",
    "<S> one consequence is that any compact complex surface that admits a non - khler , strongly hermitian solution of the einstein - maxwell equations must be rational or ruled ; cf .    [ conclusion ] below for details . </S>",
    "<S> while it is beyond the scope of the present paper to try to classify the rational or ruled surfaces which do actually admit such solutions , we will construct non - trivial examples in  [ construct ] that demonstrate that such solutions really do exist on at least one rational ruled surface :    [ behold ] let @xmath14 $ ] be a khler class on @xmath42 for which the area of one factor @xmath43 is more than quadruple the area of the other . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath14 $ ] contains pairs of khler metrics which engender two geometrically distinct solutions of the einstein - maxwell equations ( [ closed][energy ] ) via theorem [ clef ] .    </S>",
    "<S> in other words , if @xmath14(\\mathfrak{s}_1 ) > 4 [ \\omega ] ( \\mathfrak{s}_2)$ ] , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the homology classes of the two factor @xmath43 s , there are at least two different orbits of the action of @xmath46 on metrics in the given khler class which engender strongly hermitian solutions of the einstein - maxwell equations ; moreover , the hermitian metrics @xmath3 arising from these two different orbits can be distinguished from each other by their curvature properties . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the uniqueness theorems for csck metrics on compact complex manifolds @xcite unfortunately do not generalize to einstein - maxwell metrics in any obvious manner .    </S>",
    "<S> these new examples have some curious incidental properties that almost seem like an invitation to revisit difficult open questions regarding the yamabe problem on @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> a discussion of these issues and other open problems can be found in the concluding section of this article . </S>"
