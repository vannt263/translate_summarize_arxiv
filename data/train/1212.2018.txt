    "an understanding of the properties of molecular gas is important in the investigation of star formation in our galaxy .",
    "a complete theory of star formation should be able to explain certain basic properties and characteristics of dense cores and protostars .",
    "the kinematics of the dense cores and their surrounding natal environment , as well as the relation of the core mass function ( cmf ) to the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , are all linked to the initial conditions of star formation .",
    "most stars form in clusters , although @xcite find that the percentage of stars found in clusters appears to be dependent on the definitions used .",
    "many studies of the less dense gas ( e.g. co low - j transitions ) in these clusters exist ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , there are fewer surveys of the very dense gas tracers ( e.g. hcn or  @xmath7 4  3 transitions ) , which reveal the density peaks in the gas most closely associated with the protostars . with the advent of receivers like harp on the jcmt @xcite ,",
    ", large - scale dense gas surveys are now feasible .    in recent years",
    ", a general consensus has been reached that star formation is a dynamical process , occurring within a few freefall times ; the method by which molecular gas clouds collapse to form protostellar cores is also generally accepted to be a combination of gravity and turbulence .",
    "this _ gravoturbulent fragmentation _ is essentially a two - phase process @xcite : the turbulence produces density enhancements in the molecular gas cloud through a network of interacting shocks ; these density enhancements decrease the jeans mass locally @xcite allowing the densest regions ( formed at the shock intersection points ) to collapse , accrete mass and form stars .",
    "although turbulence plays such an important part in star formation , its origins , length- and timescales are still not understood .",
    "it is unclear whether turbulence in star formation regions decays freely in a crossing time @xcite , or is driven @xcite and therefore persists for a longer timescale .",
    "most competitive accretion simulations @xcite feature molecular clouds initially supported by turbulence that decays on a timescale comparable to the crossing time of the molecular cloud .",
    "this allows competitive accretion to start on small scales and grow progressively larger , fed by loss of kinetic energy from the ambient cloud .",
    "@xcite however have shown evidence for competitive accretion in an environment with driven turbulence ; as long as the turbulence is driven on large enough scales , clusters can form where gas and stars are virialised .",
    "they have also produced representative core mass functions from their numerical simulations ; however they find that with these alone they are unable to distinguish between the driven and decaying modes of turbulence . indeed ,",
    "the general properties of the cores produced in differing turbulent environments at low resolution are insufficently different @xcite to dismiss a particular environment .",
    "we have therefore decided to use an alternative method  examining the _ kinematics _ of the dense gas cores , rather than their spatial and structural properties . @xcite",
    "have performed comparisons of the kinematic properties of protostellar and starless cores produced in simulations that utilise both driven and decaying turbulence modes . comparing the intercore velocity dispersions ( i.e. the dispersions of the core centroid velocities ) , they found that protostellar cores in decaying turbulence simulations have a higher intercore velocity dispersion than the ambient gas dispersion ; protostellar cores and starless cores in driven turbulence simulations have subvirial intercore velocity dispersions and intercore velocity dispersions close to that of the gas respectively .",
    "they therefore suggest that comparing the starless and protostellar intercore velocity dispersions to the net gas dispersion could potentially distinguish between the two environments observationally .",
    "we have chosen to observe the  @xmath8 4  3 transition as it is optically thin , traces the densest regions ( n@xmath9 @xmath10 ) and will be most likely to trace the dense inner regions of prestellar cores .",
    "we can calculate linewidths and virial ratios of  cores to determine how well bound they are ; we can also potentially use the core - to - core velocity dispersions to distinguish between the two turbulence scenarios .",
    "we have also observed the  @xmath0 3  2 transition which is optically thin over most of the region and will also trace more of the less dense core envelopes for comparison with the . in addition , we observed the  @xmath0 3  2 transition to investigate the large - scale kinematics , , as well as providing evidence for outflows which would pinpoint protostellar cores .",
    "the orion b molecular cloud complex is the closest region of high - mass star formation , and lies at a distance of around 415 pc .",
    "it includes 5 major star formation regions , one of which , ngc  2068 , is the subject of this paper .",
    "ngc  2068 is a bright reflection nebula containing an infrared cluster ; submillimetre emission associated with the nebula has been observed to the south , as shown in figure [ ir_overlay ] .",
    "the first unbiased molecular gas survey of ngc  2068 was carried out by @xcite , hereafter lbs90 , using cs @xmath0 2  1 emission .",
    "they identified 2 clumps  lbs 10 and lbs 17  at 1.7  resolution .",
    "the region has since been mapped by many others , both in molecular line emission ( e.g. @xcite , in  @xmath11 1  0 ) as well as in scuba 850 @xmath12 m dust emission ( e.g. @xcite , hereafter nwt ) , breaking the two lbs regions into smaller clumps and cores .",
    "@xcite identified 18 smaller clumps with diameters of @xmath13 25  using both 850 @xmath12 m dust emission and co isotopologue mapping .",
    "the clumps they identified are labelled oribsmm ( for orion b submmillimetre emission ) and then numbered by decreasing declination .",
    ", hereafter m01 , identified 31 cores with fwhm diameters of @xmath1313  from 850 @xmath12 m dust emission ; their cores are labelled lbsx - mmy , where x is the corresponding lbs clump that the core belongs to ( either 10 or 17 ) and y begins at 1 and increases with ra .    the ngc  2068 region has been extensively studied and well - documented at different densities and resolutions , and",
    "is a fairly small , self - contained region with obvious dust and gas structure .",
    "we have therefore chosen this region for investigations of the kinematics of pre- and protostellar cores and their surrounding gas , in order to examine the initial conditions for star formation and determine the possible mechanisms for star formation in this region .",
    "we present an analysis of spectral line data from ngc  2068 , examining the gaseous structure of the region , as well as its kinematics .",
    "we break the region down into gaussian clumps using two molecules that trace different densities , to examine the kinematics and mechanisms leading to the fragmentation and formation of prestellar cores .",
    "section [ sec : obs ] gives an overview of the observations and data reduction procedure .",
    "section [ sec : res ] describes the reduced data sets , highlighting the multiple - velocity - component structure of the gas , and several high - velocity outflows .",
    "section [ sec : clfind ] presents the clumpfinding analysis of the region , using  and , while section [ sec : clprop ] examines the characteristic properties of the clumps , including shape and size , masses and velocity dispersions .",
    "we also present a comparison of observational data with numerical simulations of star formation .",
    "we summarise the results and conclude in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "the observations were made over a total of 12 nights between 6 september and 2 october 2010 , using harp at the jcmt @xcite . in total ,",
    "11.5 hours of data were taken , with an area of 400  @xmath14 600  ( centred on postion @xmath15 , + 00@xmath160000 ) being mapped .",
    "all the standard telescope observing procedures were followed for each night of observations , with regular pointings and focusing of the jcmt s secondary mirror .",
    "standard spectra were also taken towards various well - known calibration sources , to verify that the intensity in the tracking receptor matched recorded standards to within calibration tolerance before subsequent observations were allowed to continue .",
