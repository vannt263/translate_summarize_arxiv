    "of particular importance is how and when in the lifetime of the disk its constituent material is cleared , which provides clues to how and when planets may be assembled . while observations suggest that the inner and outer dust disk disperse nearly simultaneously ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is not clear which physical mechanism(s ) drives this process , or the details of how it progresses .",
    "possible dispersal mechanisms , of which several may come into play over the lifetime of a disk , include a drop in dust opacity due to grain growth , photoevaporation of material by energetic stellar radiation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "spatially resolved observations are crucial for confirming the structures inferred from disk seds .",
    "high resolution imaging at millimeter wavelengths is especially important because dust opacities are low , and the disk mass distribution can be determined in a straightforward way for an assumed opacity .",

    "the double - peaked emission structure is a geometric effect due to the truncation of disk material at a much larger radius , viewed at an intermediate inclination of 50 - 56@xmath26 @xcite : the region of highest density is near the inner disk edge , with a large column density of optically thin material in this ring effectively generating limb brightening at the inner edge of the outer disk , at two points along the disk major axis .",
    "the size of the inner hole can be roughly estimated by the separation of the emission peaks , although the peak separation will also depend on the brightness of the directly - illuminated inner edge of the outer disk relative to the extended disk component @xcite .",
    "the separation of the peaks in the 860 @xmath0 m image is @xmath27 , corresponding to a physical diameter of @xmath28 au ( radius @xmath29 au ) at a distance of 140pc .",
    "a position angle of 66@xmath26 is estimated by the orientation of a line that bisects the two peaks , although a more robust value of @xmath30 is derived in  [ sec : modelcont ] below . since the peaks are not distinctly separated in the 1.3 mm image ,",

    "the real part of the complex visibilities have been averaged in concentric annuli of deprojected @xmath31 distance from the disk center . for details of the deprojection process , see @xcite . as discussed in the appendix of @xcite ,",
    "the presence of a null in the visibility function indicates a sharp decrease in flux at a radius corresponding roughly to the angular scale of the null position .",
    "the precise position of the null depends primarily on the angular size of the inner hole , but also on the radial gradients of the surface density and temperature distribution and the relative brightness of the directly illuminated wall at the inner edge of the outer disk . in a standard power - law parameterization , the disk temperature @xmath32 and surface density @xmath33 vary inversely with radius as @xmath34 and @xmath35 . neglecting the emission from the wall and assuming standard values of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , expected for a typical viscous disk with constant @xmath5 @xcite and consistent with previous studies of the gm aur disk @xcite",

    "however , these estimates are uncertain to within @xmath130% , as the data are consistent with a broad range of null positions .",

    "the short - baseline spatial frequencies in the @xmath31 plane provided by the subcompact configuration of the sma during our observations of the @xmath2=2@xmath31 transition are sensitive to emission on the largest spatial scales .",
    "these short antenna spacings reveal the severity of the cloud contamination to an extent not possible with previous data .",
    "the contamination is evident as an extended halo around the disk emission in the central channels of the @xmath2=2@xmath31 channel maps near lsr velocities of 5 - 6kms@xmath12 ( fig .",

    "it is also evident in the moment map ( fig .",

    ". the @xmath2=3@xmath32 line appears less contaminated than @xmath2=2@xmath31 ( figs .",
    "[ fig : co32 ] and [ fig : momfig ] ) , although similarly short antenna spacings ( 8 - 43 m ) are not present in this data set .",
    "nevertheless , we expect less cloud contamination in the @xmath2=3@xmath32 transition , since the temperature of the cloud will be lower than that of the disk and will therefore populate the upper rotational levels of the co molecule less efficiently .",

    "@xcite report self - absorption along the southeast edge , but our observations suggest that this brightness asymmetry may be due to cloud contamination .",
    "it is also possible that the contamination is due to a residual envelope , although we are unable to determine the large - scale structure of the extended line emission with our interferometric data .    in all figures , the disk orientation based on the position angle of 64derived from the continuum emission ( fig .",
    "[ fig : continuum ] and  [ sec : modelcont ] ) is plotted over the co emission as a set of crossed dashed lines , with the relative extent of the major and minor axes ( based on the inclination angle of 55 ) indicated by the length of the perpendicular lines .",

    "note that the position angle of the co emission differs slightly from the position angle of the continuum emission , by @xmath4 ( see  [ sec : modelcont ] ) .",
    "the trend is clear for both transitions , but more obvious in the less - contaminated @xmath2=3@xmath32 transition .",
    "note that the position angle for the co emission is derived entirely from the rotation pattern ( evident in the isovelocity contours ) and not from the geometry of the integrated co emission : the integrated emission appears to match the position angle from the continuum emission reasonably well .",
    "we do not observe the isophote twisting in integrated co emission seen by @xcite .",
    "the cloud contamination and differences in antenna spacings may play a role .",
    "here we revisit the broadband sed modeling of gm aur presented by @xcite .",
    "taking into consideration new observational constraints at sub - millimeter and millimeter wavelengths , we use the irradiated accretion disk models of @xcite to re - derive the properties of the outer disk of gm aur and its inner , truncated edge or `` wall . ''",
    "our grain - size distribution follows a power - law of @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the grain radius .",

    "input parameters for the outer disk include the stellar properties , the mass accretion rate , the viscosity parameter ( @xmath5 ) , and the settling parameter ( @xmath46 ) which measures the dust - to - gas mass ratio in the upper layers of the disk relative to the standard dust - to - gas mass ratio .",

    "the outer disk model uses an opacity of @xmath10.1@xmath50 g@xmath12 at 1 mm @xcite which is about four times lower than that derived from the @xcite opacities , accounting for the discrepancy in mass . within the inner disk hole ,",
    "there are 1.1@xmath1410@xmath51@xmath48 of optically thin small dust grains , which account for the 10 emission and the near - ir excess .",
    "the mass in solids could be much larger than this mass if pebbles , rocks , or even planetesimals have grown in the inner disk , since they would have a negligible opacity in the near - ir .",
    "we note that @xcite reports the mass of the dust as 7@xmath1410@xmath52@xmath48 ; this is actually the mass of the gas within the hole , assuming the standard dust to gas mass ratio .",
    "the gas mass could be significantly larger , depending on the total amount of solids and the actual ratio , but these are poorly constrained by existing data .",
    "we vary the temperature of the wall to best reproduce the data .",
    "the radius of the wall is set by the temperature and dust composition , and the wall s height is set by the disk scale height .",
    "we assume that the wall is axisymmetric and composed of relatively small grains , as well as vertically flat in order to reproduce the rapid rise of the mid - ir excess at wavelengths beyond 10@xmath0 m .",
    "we adopt the dust composition used in @xcite and @xcite . the maximum grain size is adjusted from ism sizes to reproduce the shape of the irs spectrum as necessary . at short wavelengths ,",
    "larger grains have smaller opacities than ism - sized grains .",
    "therefore , at a given temperature large grains will be at smaller radii than ism - sized grains as per eqn .",

    "the derived size of the inner hole varies somewhat depending on whether the sed or the resolved millimeter visibilities are included .",
    "fitting only the broadband sed and neglecting the resolved millimeter - wavelength data , the wall is located at 26au and has a temperature of 130k and a height of @xmath12au with maximum grain size @xmath45=0.25 ( fig .",

    "the radius of the wall differs by @xmath12 au from @xcite , since here we take @xmath53 assuming magnetospheric accretion while @xcite uses @xmath54 as per the boundary layer model .",

    "it is necessary to fix the disk geometry .",
    "as listed in table [ tab : prop ] , we adopt an inclination of 55@xmath26 , in order to maintain consistency with @xcite .",

    ", we fit a position angle of @xmath57 , which differs by @xmath4 from the position angle of the co disk derived by @xcite .",

    "[ fig : catherine ] , right panel , and fig .",
    "[ fig : continuum ] , center panels ) . using the same @xmath56 comparison of visibilities",
    "as described in the previous paragraph , the 20au model represents a 3@xmath13 improvement over the 26au model , which significantly underpredicts the amount of flux produced close to the star .",
    "this 20au hole has a wall with a temperature of 120k , a height of 1.4au , and maximum grain size @xmath45=5 . for neither the 20au nor the 26au model does the wall contribute significant continuum emission at the wavelengths and spatial scales probed by our data .",
    "the main discrepancy between the fits to the sed and the millimeter visibilities occurs between wavelengths of @xmath12040 where the 20au hole model overpredicts the flux .",
    "however , the sed morphology in this region is likely sensitive to the properties of the wall at the inner disk edge , which are not well known and are not constrained by our data .",
    "it is also possible that the composition of the grains , particularly whether the silicate and graphite form composite grains or are separated , can affect the temperature and therefore the mid - ir morphology of the wall component of the sed @xcite . since our focus is on the interferometric millimeter - wavelength data , we adopt the model with a 20au inner hole for the remainder of the analysis .",
    "figure  [ fig : continuum ] compares this model with the data in the image plane ( center panel ) and in the visibility domain ( red line in the right panel ) .",

    "the flux density of the eastern peak of the 860@xmath0 m image is 50mjybeam@xmath12 , while that of the western peak is 59mjybeam@xmath12 .",
    "the corresponding peaks in the model images are 49 and 50mjybeam@xmath12 , respectively . given the rms noise of 3.5mjybeam@xmath12 , these values are consistent with no flux difference and hence axially symmetric emission from the inner disk edge .",
    "the positional accuracy of the data and knowledge of the stellar proper motion are insufficient to determine whether or not the emission peaks are equally offset from the star .",

    "this difference may be attributed to a @xmath110k difference in temperature between the gas and dust in the upper layers of the gm aur disk that are probed by these optically thick co lines .",
    "while the vertical temperature gradient of the dust in the model is fixed by the sed , a relative increase in gas temperature would populate the upper rotational transition of the molecule more efficiently and produce more @xmath2=3@xmath32 emission relative to @xmath2=2@xmath31 .",

    "the inference of an inner hole of this size from the sed and resolved millimeter visibilities is consistent with recent millimeter - wave observations of rotational transitions of co isotopologues from the gm aur disk that provide spectroscopic evidence for a diminished density of cold co within 20 au @xcite .",

    "a wide variety of mechanisms has been invoked to explain the low optical depth of the central regions of transition disks ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , each with different implications for planet formation and the process of evolution between the primordial and debris disk stages .",

    "_ grain growth  _",
    "the agglomeration of dust into larger particles should proceed faster in central regions where relative velocities of particles are faster and surface densities are higher .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , this process is inconsistent with the clearing of co from the central region observed by @xcite , as grain growth should proceed without diminishing the gas density .",
    "grain growth is also somewhat inconsistent with the steep submillimeter slope observed by @xcite for the gm aur system .",
    "the value inferred for the millimeter wavelength slope @xmath5 of 3.2 is the steepest in their sample of ten t tauri stars , and is typical of a grain population that has undergone little growth , with grain size @xmath84 mm .",
    "furthermore , the original sed model and the submillimeter visibilities both independently indicate a _",
    "sharp _ decrease in surface density or opacity near 24au , while grain growth and dust settling are predicted to be a continuous process and so should display a more gradual transition between the inner and outer disk @xcite .",
    "_ photoevaporation  _ another proposed process to generate inside - out clearing of protoplanetary disks is photoevaporation via the `` uv switch '' mechanism @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "high - energy photons from the star heat the upper disk layers , allowing material to escape the system at a rate that gradually diminishes the disk mass , while most of the disk mass drains onto the star via viscous accretion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "once the photoevaporation rate matches the accretion rate near 1  au and prevents resupply of material from the outer disk , the inner disk will decouple and drain onto the star within a viscous timescale , leaving an evacuated central region surrounded by a low - mass outer disk that will then rapidly disperse . as noted by @xcite ,",
    "the properties of the gm aur system are inconsistent with a photoevaporative scenario because the large mass of the outer disk should still be sufficient to provide a substantial accretion rate to counteract the photoevaporative wind .",
    "furthermore , the measured accretion rate is high enough that within the framework of the photoevaporation scenario , it would only be observed during the brief period of time when the inner disk was draining onto the star .",
    "photoevaporation may yet play a role in clearing the outer disk of its remaining gas and dust , but it can not explain the current lack of inner disk material .",
    "_ inside - out mri clearing ",
    "_ the magnetorotational instability operating on the inner disk edge may also drive accretion and central clearing , although it should be noted that this is purely an evacuation mechanism : it can only take hold after the generation of a gap by some other means .",
    "nevertheless , given the creation of a gap , mri clearing is predicted to operate in systems like gm aur whose outer disks are still too massive for photoevaporation to dominate @xcite .",
    "the observed depletion of co interior to 20 au radius @xcite is consistent with this theory , which predicts a total gas mass depletion of order 1000@xmath14 interior to the rim radius relative to the extrapolated value from the outer disk power law fit , normalizing to the total disk mass of 0.16@xmath85 .",
    "this theory is consistent with the substantial accretion rate of the gm aur system , yielding a value of @xmath5 of 0.005 , only slightly greater than the derived value of 0.002 from the model .",
    "@xcite estimate a gas - to - dust ratio of @xmath86 in the inner disk , roughly 10 times greater than that of the outer disk , which is consistent with the prediction of the inside - out mri evaporation scenario that flux from the star should promote blowout of small dust grains by radiation pressure , substantially clearing the inner disk of dust even as the gas continues to accrete onto the star .",
    "however , it is difficult to reconcile this with the substantial population of @xmath0m - size grains that must be present in the inner disk to account for the 10@xmath0 m silicate feature in the irs spectrum .",
    "it is also important to consider the source of the requisite initial gap in the disk .",
    "_ binarity  _ the dynamical influence of an unseen stellar or substellar companion would also cause clearing of the inner disk .",
    "a notable example is the recent result by @xcite demonstrating that the inner hole in the transition disk around coku tau/4 is caused by a previously unobserved companion .",
    "there are relatively few constraints on the multiplicity of gm aur at the @xmath87au separations relevant for the inner hole .",
    "radial velocity studies with kms@xmath12 precision do not note variability @xcite , ruling out a close massive companion . as @xcite discuss , the stellar temperature and dynamical mass from the disk rotation combined with the h - band flux place an upper limit of @xmath10.3 m@xmath7 on the mass of a companion .",
    "interferometric aperture - masking observations with nirc2 that take advantage of adaptive optics on the keck ii telescope place an upper limit of @xmath140 times the mass of jupiter on companions with separations between 1.5 and 35au from the primary ( a. kraus and m. ireland , private communication ) .",
    "the presence of hot co in the central 1au of the system @xcite and the high accretion rate , undiminished relative to the taurus median , also argue against the presence of a massive close companion .",
    "a stellar companion is therefore an unlikely origin for the central clearing in the gm aur system .",
    "_ planet - disk interaction ",
    "_ perhaps the most compelling mechanism for producing a transition disk is the dynamic clearing of material by a giant planet a few times the mass of jupiter .",
    "the opening of gaps and holes in circumstellar disks has long been predicted as a consequence of giant planet formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "some simulations have shown that inner holes may in fact be a more common outcome than gaps as angular momentum transfer mediated by spiral density waves can clear the inner disk faster than the viscous timescale @xcite .",
    "the planet - induced clearing scenario was considered in detail for gm aur by @xcite and found to be globally consistent with the observed properties of the system ( although their estimate of the inner hole radius is based on pre-_spitzer _ sed information ) .",
    "this mechanism naturally explains the diminished but persistent accretion rates and presence of small dust grains through two predictions of models of planet - disk interaction : ( 1 ) filtration of dust grains according to size is expected at the inner disk edge , leading to a dominant population of small grains in the inner disk @xcite ; and ( 2 ) a sustained reduction in accretion rate to @xmath88 of that through the outer disk is predicted as the giant planet begins to intercept most of the accreting material @xcite .",
    "these effects combined may also explain the enhanced gas - to - dust ratio in the inner disk .",
    "a planet - induced gap could also serve as a catalyst for inside - out mri clearing @xcite .",
    "given the observed 20au inner disk radius and the scenario of clearing via dynamical interaction with a giant planet , it is possible to make a simple estimate of the distance of the planet from the star .",
    "the width of a gap opened by a planet is approximately @xmath89 roche radii @xcite , and simulations show that the minimum mass necessary to open a gap is of order 1 jupiter mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if the outer edge of the planet - induced gap coincides with the 20au inner disk radius ( with the portion of the disk interior to the planet cleared via spiral density waves or the mri ) , then a companion between 1 and 40 times the mass of jupiter would be located between 11 and 16au from the star .",
    "the influence of a planet carving out an inner cavity in the dust distribution is therefore a plausible scenario , bolstered by recent results demonstrating that a planet is responsible for dynamical sculpting of dust in the much older fomalhaut system @xcite .",
    "while the model comparison in  [ sec : model ] above shows that co emission from the disk is globally consistent with keplerian rotation , the 11   difference in position angle between the continuum data and the two co data sets is significant at the @xmath90 level , and may indicate some kinematic deviation from pure keplerian rotation in a single plane .",
    "changes in position angle with physical scale are commonly interpreted as warps in the context of studies of galaxy dynamics ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; it may be that the change in position angle in the gm aur disk indicates a kinematic warp .",
    "the possibility of a warp or other deviation from keplerian rotation was discussed by @xcite , although their discussion was based on possible isophote twisting observed in integrated co @xmath2=2@xmath31 contours .",
    "we observe no such isophote twisting in the integrated co @xmath2=21 or @xmath2=32 emission presented here ( fig . [ fig : momfig ] ) , although this determination may be influenced by the differing baseline lengths and beam shapes in the respective interferometric data sets .",
    "instead , we observe deviations from the expected position angle only in the rotation pattern of the resolved co emission , which is reflected in the isovelocity contours of fig . [",
    "fig : momfig ] .",
    "this position angle change does not appear to be related to the cloud contamination , as it is more clear in the less - contaminated co @xmath2=3@xmath32 data set . in order to test whether the position angle of the true brightness distribution might have been altered by incomplete sampling of the data in the fourier domain , we generated a model of the disk at a position angle of 64 , consistent with that measured independently for the two continuum data sets .",
    "we then fit the position angle by @xmath56 minimization as in  [ sec : modelcont ] above . with this method , after sampling with the response at the spatial frequencies in the co @xmath2=32 data set , we recover the position angle to within less than a degree of the input model .",
    "this is to be expected , since the @xmath56 fitting procedure takes into account the interferometer response when fitting for the position angle .",
    "the position angle change is therefore robust independent of beam convolution effects .    in order to cause a change in position angle on physical scales between those probed by the continuum ( @xmath91au ) and the co ( @xmath92au )",
    ", a warp would have to occur at a size scale of order 100au .",
    "the most natural explanations for the presence of a warp in a gas - rich circumstellar disk include flybys and perturbations by a planet or substellar companion .",
    "a simple estimate of the timescale of flyby interactions is @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the number density of stars , @xmath95 is the approach distance , and @xmath13 is the velocity dispersion . assuming typical values for taurus , including a stellar density of @xmath110pc@xmath96 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and velocity dispersion of 0.2kms@xmath12 @xcite , the timescale for interactions at distances of @xmath11000 au , sufficient to cause significant perturbations at oort cloud radii @xcite , is of order 1gyr . since the results of a one - time perturbation would likely damp in a few orbital periods ( 10@xmath97yr at a distance of 100au ) , such an interaction is statistically unlikely .",
    "however , it should be noted that a recent interaction might have been capable of producing an extended feature like the `` blue ribbon '' observed in scattered light by @xcite .    the influence of a massive planet or substellar companion has been investigated as the origin of warps observed in gas - depleted debris disks , including @xmath98 pic @xcite and hd  100546 @xcite",
    ". however , there is a dearth of theoretical investigation into the plausibility of warps caused by planetary systems in gas - rich disks more closely analogous to the gm aur system . since the warp in the gm aur disk must occur between the hill sphere of the putative planet and the @xmath1200au resolution of the co line observations , it is plausible that the warp could be due to the gravitational influence of the same body responsible for evacuating the inner disk .",
    "a theoretical inquiry into this possibility would be useful , but is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "spatially resolved observations in millimeter continuum emission , obtained using the sma at 860@xmath0 m and pdbi at 1.3 mm , reveal a sharp decrease in optical depth near the center of the gm aur disk .",
    "simple estimates of the extent of this region , based on the separation of peaks in the continuum images and the position of the null in the visibility functions in fig .",
    "[ fig : continuum ] , are consistent with the inner hole radius of 24au derived by @xcite using disk structure models to fit the sed .",
    "no significant azimuthal asymmetry is detected in the continuum emission .",
    "refined versions of the sed - based model of @xcite show that the data are very well reproduced by a disk model with an inner hole of radius 20au .",
    "this model overpredicts the broadband sed flux in the 2040@xmath0 m wavelength regime , but this region of the spectrum likely depends on the properties of the wall at the inner disk edge , which are poorly constrained by available data .",
    "co emission in the @xmath2=3@xmath32 and @xmath2=2@xmath31 transitions confirms the presence of a disk with kinematics consistent with keplerian rotation about the central star , but at a position angle offset from the continuum by @xmath111 .",
    "the morphology of the co emission is broadly consistent with the sed model , but with a larger co @xmath2=32/@xmath2=21 line ratio than predicted for the sed model .",
    "this is a likely indication of additional gas heating relative to dust in the upper disk atmosphere .",
    "given the observed properties of the gm aur system , photoevaporation , grain growth , and binarity are unlikely physical mechanisms for inducing a sharp decrease in opacity or surface density at the disk center .",
    "the inner hole plausibly results from the dynamical influence of a planet on the disk material , with the inner disk possibly cleared by spiral density waves or the mri .",
