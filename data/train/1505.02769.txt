    "radio sources with a total projected size of @xmath15 mpc are categorized into giant radio galaxies .",
    "they constitute one of the largest classes of astrophysical objects in the universe . with a typical spectral age",
    "@xmath16 being higher than a few @xmath17 myr @xcite , they are recognized as relatively old systems .",
    "therefore , the giant radio galaxies are utilized to investigate the activity of jets and associated lobes in evolved radio sources , which has been yet to be explored .",
    "lobes of radio galaxies accumulate an enormous amount of relativistic plasma , comprised of electrons and magnetic field ( and possibly heavy particles including protons , although the present paper does not deal with them ) .",
    "the plasma energy in the lobes is sourced from the bulk kinetic energy of the jets through their terminal hot spots .",
    "this makes the lobes one of the most valuable probes for the past jet activity .",
    "it is able to estimate roughly the plasma energy in the lobes by their synchrotron radio radiation .",
    "however , the radio information alone is not useful to disentangle the electron and magnetic - field energies , and thus , the minimum energy condition @xcite was widely assumed , without any concrete physical justification .",
    "another valuable information to study the energetics should be provided by inverse compton ( ic ) x - ray emission from the synchrotron - emitting electrons in the lobes , where the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons are boosted up @xcite .",
    "the ic x - ray spectrum , in comparison with the synchrotron radio one , enables an independent estimate of the electron and magnetic energies . in the last two decades since its discovery from the lobes of fornax a @xcite ,",
    "the ic x - ray radiation has been a standard tool to diagnose the lobe energetics ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the technique was strengthen by the ic @xmath18-ray detection with the fermi observatory from the outer lobes of centaurus a @xcite .",
    "as a result , the electron energy is found to surpass the magnetic one in the lobes , typically by a factor of @xmath19  @xmath20 .    until recently ,",
    "ic x - ray examination on lobes of giant radio galaxies has been hampered by mainly their faintness .",
    "for diffuse x - ray sources with a low surface brightness , the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ; @xcite ) onboard the suzaku observatory @xcite exhibits a great advantage , owing to its moderate field of view ( a @xmath21 square ) and to its rather low and stable instrumental background @xcite .",
    "actually , a systematic study with the xis has been just conducted for the lobes of several giant radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "this research arrived at a significant detection of ic x - ray photons from these lobes , and pioneeringly hinted that the current jet activities are significantly declined in the giant radio galaxies , compared with those with a moderate size ( e.g. , @xmath22 kpc ) .",
    "this motivates us to enlarge urgently the sample of ic - detected giant radio galaxies .    the giant radio galaxy , 3c 236 , is located at the redshift of @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "assuming the cosmology with @xmath24 km s@xmath25 mpc@xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , the redshift gives an angle - to - size conversion ratio of @xmath28 .",
    "it is optically classified as a low excitation radio galaxy , with weak emission lines @xcite . with a classical fanaroff - riley ii radio morphology @xcite",
    ", the radio source has an angular extent of @xmath21 @xcite , which corresponds to a projected linear size of @xmath29 mpc .",
    "therefore , this had been known as the largest radio source all over the sky , until the giant radio galaxy j1420 - 0545 with a size of @xmath30 mpc was discovered @xcite .",
    "the age of the source is estimated as @xmath31 myr by the synchrotron aging technique @xcite , indicating that it is really an elderly radio galaxy .",
    "these make 3c 236 as an ideal target for the ic x - ray study with suzaku .",
    "actually , a faint x - ray emission associated with its west lobe has been concretely detected in the suzaku observation , as is reported in the present paper .",
    "the log of the suzaku observations for the giant radio galaxy , 3c 236 , is given in table [ tab : log ] .",
    "we focused on the west lobe , since radio images of 3c 236 ( e.g. , @xcite ) indicate that diffuse radio emission is more pronounced in the west lobe while a significant dominance of double bright hot spots is recognized in the east one .",
    "the central region of the west lobe was placed at the nominal position of the x - ray telescope ( xrt ; @xcite ) for the xis .",
    "we fixed the satellite roll angle at @xmath32 deg , in order to avoid contamination onto the west lobe from calibration sources at the specific corners of the xis field of view , and distortion by the anomalous columns of the xis 0 .",
    "unfortunately , in this configuration , the 3c 236 nucleus is located slightly outside the xis field of view .",
    "we observed another sky field on the southwest of the west lobe field , which is known to be relatively free from contaminating bright x - ray point sources ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and evaluated the x - ray background ( xrb ) spectrum .",
    "this xrb field has not yet been observed with asca , chandra , and xmm - newton .    the present paper deals with the xis results only , because no significant x - ray signals were detected with the hard x - ray detector @xcite from both sky field .",
    "the standard software package , heasoft 6.16 , was adopted for data reduction and analysis .",
    "we referred the calibration database ( caldb ) as of 2014 july 1 and 2011 june 30 for the xis and xrt , respectively .",
    "all the xis events were reprocessed with the suzaku tool , aepipeline .",
    "we filtered the data by the following standard criteria ; the satellite is outside the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) , the time after an saa passage is larger than @xmath33 s , the geomagnetic cut - off rigidity is higher than 6 gv , the source elevation is higher than and above the rim of day and night earth , respectively , and the xis data are unaffected by telemetry saturation .",
    "the filtering procedures yielded 78.0 ks and 42.4 ks of good exposures for the west - lobe and xrb fields , respectively .    in the scientific analysis",
    "below , we picked up those events with an xis grade of 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , or 6 . in order to mitigate the artificial increase in the non - x - ray background ( nxb ) level related to the charge injection , those pixels flagged as sci_2nd_trailing_row were masked out for the backside - illuminated ( bi ) ccd chip ( xis 1 ) .",

    "therefore , we have concluded that the seed photons are dominantly provided by the cmb radiation and the other candidate sources have only a negligible contribution .      by comparing the ic x - ray and synchrotron radio spectral energy distributions presented in figure [ fig : sed ] , we can measure the energy densities of the electrons and magnetic field , @xmath14 and @xmath176 respectively , in the west lobe of 3c 236 .",
    "the input observables , required to calculate @xmath14 and @xmath176 , are listed in the upper columns of table [ tab : spec_ueum ] .",
    "the synchrotron radio flux density and photon index ( @xmath177 jy at 608.5 mhz and @xmath1 in the @xmath2  @xmath3 mhz range , respectively ) were derived from @xcite .",
    "we adopted the ic x - ray flux density at 1 kev of @xmath5 njy derived in case 2 where the x - ray photon index was fixed at the radio value .",
    "corresponding to the radio and x - ray spectral slope , the electron number density spectrum was assumed to be a simple pl form described as @xmath178 .",
    "the volume of the west lobe was estimated as @xmath179 @xmath180 , since we approximated the shape of the west lobe to be the ellipsoid with the major and minor radius of @xmath65 kpc and @xmath66 kpc , respectively ( see  [ sec : image ] and  [ sec : origin ] ) .",
    "we analytically evaluated the energetics in the west lobe of 3c 236 by referring to @xcite .",
    "the result is summarized in the lower columns of table [ tab : spec_ueum ] . here and hereafter , the statistical error of @xmath153 is propagated to the first one , while all the other errors ( including those in @xmath181 , @xmath4 and so forth ) are taken into account in the second one . the specially averaged magnetic field strength is derived as @xmath12 @xmath13 g from the equation ( 11 ) in @xcite described as @xmath182 , where @xmath183 is the synchrotron radio ( and hence the ic x - ray ) energy index , @xmath184 and @xmath185 are the frequencies at @xmath181 and @xmath153 are measured respectively , @xmath186 is approximately constant at @xmath187 over the range of @xmath188  @xmath189 , and @xmath190 is evaluated as @xmath191 at @xmath192 ( @xmath159 ) .",
    "this magnetic field strength is equivalent to the magnetic energy density of @xmath10 ergs @xmath9 .",
    "for the electron spectral slope of @xmath193 ( i.e. , @xmath194 ) , the @xmath14 estimate is known to be rather sensitive to the assumption on the minimum lorentz factor of the electrons . however , it has not yet been observationally explored . following the previous studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we first evaluated the energy density of electrons with a lorentz factor of @xmath195  @xmath196 , because they are directly observable through the ic and synchrotron radiations .",
    "the energy density of these electrons was derived as @xmath8 ergs @xmath9 .",
    "this indicates a slight electron dominant condition in the west lobe , as parameterized by the electron to magnetic field energy density radio of @xmath11 .",
    "second , we lowered the minimum electron lorentz factor down to @xmath197 , since the existence of such low - energy electrons was suggested in a number of strong and compact radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "in addition , a similar value of the minimum lorentz factor was adopted to interpret low - frequency radio data of some giant radio galaxies @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the electron energy density increased to @xmath198 erg @xmath9 .",
    "correspondingly , the electron dominance in the lobe was found to become more prominent , as @xmath199 .",
    "figure [ fig : ue - um ] compiles the relation between @xmath14 ( for @xmath195  @xmath196 ) and @xmath176 in the lobes of radio galaxies , from which the ic x - ray emission was detected ( @xcite , and reference therein ) .",
    "the figure clearly demonstrates that a typical electron dominance of @xmath200 ",
    "@xmath20 is realized in the radio lobes , regardless of their physical size @xcite .",
    "our suzaku result on the west lobe of the giant radio galaxy 3c 236 is found to be fully compatible with this picture .",
    "due to their low energy densities , the ic - detected giant radio galaxies are distributed in the bottom - left end of the @xmath14@xmath176 plot ( i.e. , figure [ fig : ue - um ] ) . in the discussion , we neglect the lobes of the giant radio galaxy , 3c 457 , which is located around the center in figure [ fig : ue - um ] , since it is reported to be one of the youngest sources ( @xmath201 myr ; @xcite ) among the giant radio galaxies . in the lobes of giant radio galaxies , a dominance of the ic radiative loss over the synchrotron one",
    "is theoretically pointed out , because their magnetic energy density is predicted to be less than the cmb energy density @xcite .",
    "the recent suzaku results on the giant radio lobes @xcite , including our present result on 3c 236 , have observationally confirmed this idea , by demonstrating a condition of @xmath202 .",
    "especially , the ic loss is extremely dominant in 3c 236 as @xmath203 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : ue - length ] , the electron energy density in the lobes are plotted against the total projected length of the radio galaxies , @xmath204 .",
    "@xcite proposed that a lobe evolves along a track of @xmath205 on the plot , while it is actively energized by its jet .",
    "the lobe is also predicted to deviate from the @xmath14@xmath204 track toward a lower @xmath14 value , due to significant radiative and adiabatic losses , after the energy import by its jet has ceased .",
    "the relation of @xmath206 observed for the radio galaxies with a moderate size of @xmath207 kpc ( the dashed line in figure [ fig : ue - length ] ; @xcite ) is thought to qualitatively back up the former idea .",
    "the latter scenario was observationally demonstrated by the radio galaxy fornax a which is reported to host a very dormant nucleus and jet . as is shown in figure [ fig : ue - length ] , the electron energy density in the lobes of fornax a is by more than a factor of 10 smaller than the value expected from the @xmath14@xmath204 regression line for the radio galaxies with @xmath208 kpc .",
    "the recent systematic studies with suzaku ( e.g. , @xcite ) revealed that the lobes of the giant radio galaxies tend to exhibit a lower @xmath14 value by nearly an order of magnitude , in comparison to the simple extension of the regression line for the @xmath209 kpc radio galaxies .",
    "this is clearly visualized in figure [ fig : ue - length ] . by analogy with fornax",
    "a , this property indicates that the activity of the jets in the giant radio galaxies have been already declined , and their energy input to the lobes is currently defeated by the radiative and adiabatic losses of the electrons @xcite .",
    "in contrast , @xmath14 in the west lobe of 3c 236 coincides with the value estimated from the @xmath14@xmath204 relation for the smaller sources .",
    "this result suggests that the lobe is still supplied with a sufficient energy from the jet .",
    "even though the current lobe is energetically decoupled from the jet , it has not yet entered a cooling - dominant regime .",
    "the ongoing energy transport ( or transport until recently ) to the west lobe of 3c 236 appears to be reinforced by the observational fact that the radio spectrum around the west hot spot ( e.g. , @xmath210 in @xmath2 mhz ",
    "ghz for the _ western hot spot _ region in @xcite ) is harder than those in the surrounding regions . @xcite",
    "closely investigated similarities between the small - scale ( @xmath212 kpc ) and large - scale ( @xmath21 mpc ) radio structures .",
    "they pointed out that the interaction of the jet with the interstellar medium in the central region of 3c 236 , creating the small - scale structure , continued for more than an order of magnitude longer than @xmath213 myr .",
    "the interaction is inferred to have consequently formed the the mpc - scale lobes .",
    "the energy supply to the lobe is possible to be maintained by such a long - lasting inteaction .",
    "in contrast , the lack or weekness of the radio jet connecting the radio structures in small and large scales especially toward the west direction @xcite , which is reminiscent of giant double - double radio galaxies @xcite , implies that the jet activity in 3c 236 is highly variable or episodic , rather than stable over its life time ( e.g. , @xcite ) . by comparing the dynamical age of the small - scale structure ( @xmath214 myr ) and the radiative age of young electrons contained in the hot spots within the large - scale lobes @xcite",
    ", @xcite proposed that the jet had been possibly switched off for @xmath213 myr .",
    "a high - resolution vlbi image @xcite supports a recent ignition of a one - sided jet to the west in a 10 mas scale ( corresponding to @xmath215 pc at the 3c 236 rest frame ) .",
    "the jet reactivation was suggested to be triggered @xmath216 myr ago by a minor merger event that took place @xmath213 myr ago @xcite .",
    "we briefly examine the impact of adiavatic and radiative losses during the suggested jet hibernation .",
    "when the distance from the nucleus to the lobe edge ( @xmath217 mpc ) is devided by the source age ( @xmath218 myr ; @xcite ) , the time - averaged advance speed of the 3c 236 west lobe is roughly evaluated as @xmath219 .",
    "this agrees with the typical lobe speed measured for fanaroff - riley ii radio galaxies ( @xmath220  @xmath221 ; @xcite ) . at the advance speed",
    ", the lobe head proceeds to @xmath222 kpc in @xmath17 myr .",
    "this results in an expansion of the west lobe volume by less than @xmath223 % .",
    "therefore , the adiabatic loss during the jet dormancy is considered to be relatively insignificant in the 3c 236 west lobe .",
    "the radiative time scale of the electrons in the west lobe is evaluated as @xmath224 myr @xmath225 where both the synchrotron and ic radiation is taken into account . here",
    ", the electron lorents factor of @xmath226 corresponds to the synchrotron photons of @xmath227 ghz under the magnetic field strength of @xmath228 @xmath13 g which is measured in this study .",
    "this means that the radiative cooling due to the jet hibernation is neglidgible to the electrons , for which we integrated the energy density @xmath14 ( i.e. , @xmath229  @xmath230 or @xmath231  @xmath230 ) .",
    "as mentioned above , the flat synchrotron spectrum in the hot spot is compatible with the scenario that the west lobe of 3c 236 has not yet been in the cooling domain .",
    "therefore , we have concluded that our result does not contradict to the reported suspention of the jet ejection .",
    "another energy injection channel is hinted in the 1.4 ghz radio image by @xcite , which reveals a wiggling inner ridge in the central region of the west lobe .",
    "they interpreted that the rigde was created by a recent jet penetrating the west lobe .",
    "this possibly yields a very attractive idea that the new jet re - energizes the west lobe and prevents it from being cooled in the future .",
    "we thank the anonymous reviewer for her / his constructive and supportive suggestions .",
    "we are grateful to all the members of the suzaku team , for the successful operation and calibration .",
    "this research has made use of the archival chandra data and its related software provided by the chandra x - ray center ( cxc ) .",
