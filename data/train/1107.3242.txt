    "anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) refers to the transverse charge current generation in solids in a ferromagnetic phase by the electric field and has received intensive renewed interest in recent years mainly because of its close connection with spin transport phenomena@xcite .",
    "there are several competing mechanisms proposed for the ahe .",
    "extrinsic mechanisms of skew scattering@xcite and side jump@xcite refer to the modified impurity scattering caused the spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) .",
    "another mechanism arises from the transverse velocity of the bloch electrons induced by the soi , discovered by karplus and luttinger@xcite , and thus is of intrinsic nature .",
    "this intrinsic ahe has recently been reinterpreted in terms of the berry curvature of the occupied bloch states.@xcite furthermore , recent quantitative first - principles studies based on the berry phase formalism showed that the intrinsic ahe is important in various materials.@xcite in particular , in itinerant ferromagnets such as fe and co , the intrinsic anomalous hall conductivity given by first - principles calculations@xcite has been found to agree with the experimental anomalous hall conductivity @xcite within 30 % , thereby demonstrating the dominance of the intrinsic mechanism .",
    "nonetheless , the physical origin of the ahe in nickel is still not fully understood .",
    "recent first - principles density functional calculations with the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) predicted a large intrinsic anomalous hall conductivity of -2203 @xmath12@xmath13 in ni@xcite , which is more than three times larger than the corresponding experimental value of -646 @xmath12@xmath13 @xcite at room temperature . in the latest experiment@xcite",
    ", the intrinsic hall conductivity was found to be -1100 @xmath12@xmath13 at low temperatures . though this value is significantly larger than that of the much earlier experiment@xcite , it is still only half of the calculated intrinsic hall conductivity@xcite .",
    "first - principles gga calculations have been rather successful in describing many physical properties such as crystal structure , elastic constant and spin magnetic moment , of itinerant ferromagnets fe , co and ni ( see , e.g. , ref . and references therein )",
    ". however , gga calculations fail in describing some relativistic soi - induced phenomena in these itinerant magnets . for example , the theoretical values of orbital magnetic moment account for only about 50 % of the measured ones in fe and co@xcite and the calculated magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy of ni is even wrong in sign@xcite .",
    "this failure of the gga is generally attributed to its incorrect treatment of the moderate 3@xmath3 electron - electron correlation in these systems .",
    "several theoretical methods that go beyond the density functional theory ( dft ) with the local density approximation ( lda ) or gga , such as the orbital - polarization correction@xcite and lda / gga plus on - site coulomb interaction u ( lda / gga+u)@xcite schemes , have been developed for better description of the soi - induced phenomena in magnetic solids .",
    "indeed , the orbital - polarization correction has been found to bring the calculated orbital moments in many itinerant magnets such as fe and co in good agreement with experiments@xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been demonstrated that the correct easy axes and the magnitudes of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy of fe and ni can be obtained within the lda+u scheme.@xcite    therefore , in this work , we perform gga+u calculations for nickel to better understand the mechanism of its anomalous hall effect .",
    "we use highly accurate all - electron full - potential linearized augmented plane wave ( flapw ) method@xcite .",
    "we find that including on - site electron - electron correlation in nickel has significant effect on its anomalous hall effect as well as its electronic structure near the fermi level .",
    "in particular , the calculated anomalous hall conductivity reduces from -2200 @xmath12@xmath13 ( gga ) to -1066 @xmath12@xmath13 , and the latter value is in very good agreement with the measured low temperature intrinsic hall conductivity of -1100 @xmath12@xmath13 from latest experiments.@xcite    this paper is organized as follows . in next section , we briefly describe how the intrinsic anomalous hall conductivity is calculated within the linear - response kubo formalism as well as the numerical method and computational details used in the present work . in sec .",
    "iii , we first present the calculated anomalous hall conductivity , magnetic moments and also relativistic band structure .",
    "we then compare our results with available experiments and also previous calculations .",
    "finally , we make some predictions about the intrinsic anomalous hall conductivity for fcc ni@xmath8co(fe , cu)@xmath9 alloys with small co(fe , cu ) concentration @xmath10 , within the rigid band approximation . in sec .",
    "iv , we summarize the main conclusions drawn from the present work .",
    "the intrinsic anomalous hall conductivity of a solid can be evaluated by using the kubo formula  @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic hall effect comes from the static limit ( @xmath15=0 ) of the off - diagonal element of the optical conductivity  @xcite . following the procedure for the calculation of the intrinsic spin hall conductivity@xcite",
    ", we first calculate the imaginary part of the off - diagonal element of the optical conductivity    @xmath16\\delta(\\hbar\\omega-\\epsilon_{n^{'}n } ) \\end{split}\\ ] ]    where @xmath17 is the unit cell volume , @xmath18 is the photon energy , @xmath19 is the @xmath20th bloch state with crystal momentum @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the velocity operator , and @xmath23 .",
    "we then obtain the real part from the imaginary part by a kramers - kronig transformation @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the principle value of the integral .",
    "the intrinsic anomalous hall conductivity @xmath0 is the static limit of the off - diagonal element of the optical conductivity @xmath26(@xmath15=0 ) .",
    "we notice that the anomalous hall conductivity of bcc fe calculated in this way@xcite is in quantitative agreement with that calculated directly by accounting for the berry phase correction to the group velocity  @xcite .",
    "since all the intrinsic hall effects are caused by the soi , first - principles calculations must be based on a relativistic band theory . here",
    "the relativistic band structure of fcc ni is calculated using the highly accurate flapw method , as implemented in the wien2k code@xcite .",
    "the self - consistent electronic structure calculations are based on the dft with the gga for the exchange correlation potential  @xcite . to further take @xmath3-electron correlation into account",
    ", we include on - site coulomb interaction @xmath27 in the gga+u approach@xcite .",
    "the so - called around - mean - field ( amf ) scheme for double counting correction@xcite is adopted here .",
    "@xmath1 ev and @xmath28 ev , which were found to give the correct sign and magnitude of magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy for fcc ni@xcite , are used .",
    "furthermore , the gga+u calculations using the double counting correction scheme designed for approximate self - interaction correction ( sic ) for strongly correlated systems such as transition metal oxides@xcite , have also been performed",
    ". nevertheless , the theoretical anomalous hall conductivities from the gga+u calculations using both double counting correction schemes , are almost identical ( see table i below ) .",
    "since the amf scheme is believed to be more suitable for metallic systems@xcite , here we will concentrate on the results of the amf calculations .",
    "moreover , the gga+u calculations with a larger @xmath27 value of 2.5 ev are also performed to see how the variation of @xmath27 may affect the calculated anomalous hall conductivity .",
    "the experimental lattice constant @xmath29 @xcite is used here . the muffin - tin sphere radius ( @xmath30 ) used is 2.2 a.u .",
    "the wave function , charge density , and potential were expanded in terms of the spherical harmonics inside the muffin - tin spheres , and the cutoff angular momentum ( @xmath31 ) used is 10 , 6 , and 6 , respectively .",
    "the wave function outside the muffin - tin spheres was expanded in terms of the augmented plane waves , and a large number of augmented plane waves ( about 70 apws per atom , i.e. , the maximum size of the crystal momentum @xmath32 ) were included in the present calculations .",
    "the improved tetrahedron method is used for the brillouin - zone integration.@xcite to obtain accurate ground state charge density as well as spin and orbital magnetic moments , a fine @xmath33 grid of 185193 @xmath34-points in the first brillouin zone was used .     as a function of the inverse of the number of @xmath34-points in the brillouin zone ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the dashed lines are a polynormial fit to the calculated values to get the extropolated value of @xmath0 at @xmath36 . for comparison , the theoretical value by wang _",
    "et al._@xcite and the experimental value by ye _",
    "et al._@xcite are also shown as the horizontal dotted and dot - dashed lines , respectively.,width=302 ]",
    "like the calculation of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy of bulk magnets@xcite , a very fine @xmath34-point mesh is needed for the anomalous hall conductivity calculation.@xcite therefore , we perform the @xmath0 calculations using several extremely fine @xmath34-point meshes with the finest @xmath34-point mesh being @xmath37 .",
    "the calculated @xmath0 is plotted as a function of the inverse of the number ( @xmath35 ) of @xmath34-points in the first brillouin zone in fig .",
    "the calculated values of @xmath0 are fitted to a polynormal to get the converged theoretical @xmath0 ( i.e. , the extropolated value of @xmath0 at @xmath36 ) ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . the theoretical @xmath0 obtained in this way as well as the calculated spin ( @xmath38 ) and orbital ( @xmath39 ) magnetic moments are listed in table i. also listed in table i are the available experimental and previous theoretical @xmath0 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "table i shows that the theoretical @xmath0 from the gga is -2200 @xmath12@xmath13 , and is much larger than the experimental value of -646 @xmath12@xmath13 at room temperature@xcite and also the experimentally derived intrinsic value of -1100 @xmath12@xmath13 at low temperatures@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the present result is in very good agreement with the previous gga calculations@xcite , as it should be ( see table i and fig .",
    "1 ) . interestingly , when the on - site coulomb interaction is taken into account via the gga+u scheme , the calculated @xmath0 reduces significantly .",
    "in particular , when @xmath1 ev and @xmath28 ev which were found to give rise to the correct easy axis and magnitude of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy@xcite , the theoretical @xmath0 becomes -1066 @xmath12@xmath13 .",
    "this good agreement between the present gga+u calculation and the low temperature measurements@xcite ( table i and fig .",
    "1 ) indicates that the intrinsic ahe dominates in nickel and that the 3@xmath3 electron - electron correlation in itinerant magnets such as nickel has an important effect on the ahe , although being only moderate . further increasing @xmath27 to 2.5",
    "ev reduces the calculated @xmath0 slightly ( table i and fig .",
    "1 ) . as expected , the gga+u calculations increase the theoretical spin and orbital magnetic moments , and hence enlarge somewhat the discrepancies between the calculations and experiments ( table i ) .",
    "nonetheless , with @xmath1 ev and @xmath28 ev , the theoretical spin and orbital magnetic moments are still in reasonable agreement with the experiments ( table i ) .    .calculated anomalous hall conductivity @xmath40 ( @xmath12@xmath13 ) as well as spin magnetic moment @xmath38 ( @xmath41/atom ) and orbital magnetic moment @xmath38 ( @xmath41/atom ) .",
    "superscripts of sic indicate that the values are obtained from the gga+u calculations with the sic double counting correction scheme ( see sec .",

    "[ moment ]        to help understand how the on - site electron - electron correlation affects the electronic band structure and ahe in nickel , we plot in fig . 2 and fig .",
    "3 the relativistic energy bands along the high symmetry lines in the brillouin zone calculated both without and with on - site coulomb interaction u. the relativistic band structure may be regarded as the result of a superposition of the corresponding scalar - relativsitic spin - up and spin - down band structures with many accidental band - crossings ( degeneracies ) lifted by the soi . in nickel , nevertheless , these soi - induced splittings are generally much smaller than the exchange splittings , and thus can be treated as a perturbation.@xcite also , including the soi would lower the symmetry of the system . in the present work ,",
    "the magnetization is assumed to be along the [ 001 ] direction , and the symmetry of the system becomes the tetragonal one .",
    "the six high symmetry x points which are equivalent in the nonrelativistic ( or scalar - relativistic ) case , now form two inequivalent groups , namely , two equivalent @xmath46 z points and four equivalent @xmath46 x and @xmath46 y points .",
    "therefore , the energy bands near the z point are slightly different from that near the x and y points , as shown in fig . 2 and fig .",
    "the relativistic band structure and fermi surface of ni has been reported by several researchers before by using different band structure calculation methods ( see , e.g. , refs . ) .",
    "in particular , wang and callaway analysed in detail the energy band characters and fermi surface sheets.@xcite the present gga relativistic band structure ( the red dashed curves in fig . 2 and fig .",
    "3 ) is very similar to that reported by wang and callaway@xcite .",
    "for example , in both cases , there are five bands ( bands 8 - 12 ) crossing the fermi level , and there is a small down - spin - dominant hole pocket ( band 8 , noted as x@xmath14 ) centered at the x(y , z ) symmetry point ( see figs . 2 - 3 , and also fig . 1 in ref . ) .",
    "however , the small x@xmath14 hole pocket was not found in the de haas - van alphen experiments.@xcite    now let us focus on the changes in the relativistic band structure caused by including the on - site coulomb interaction .",
    "a pronounced change is that all the @xmath3-dominant bands are lowered in energy relative to the fermi level , when the on - site coulomb interaction is taken into account in the gga+u scheme ( see figs . 2 - 3 ) .",
    "in other words , the binding energy of the @xmath3-dominated valence bands is increased by about 0.3 ev .",
    "in particular , the down - spin band 8 is now pushed completely below the fermi level and the small x@xmath14 hole pocket disappears .",
    "the absence of the x@xmath14 hole pocket is consistent with the de haas - van alphen experiments.@xcite in ref .",
    ", the absence of the x@xmath14 hole pocket caused by the on - site coulomb interaction was regarded as the main reason that the lda+u calculations predicted the correct easy axis for nickel . as will be shown below",
    ", this band 8 near the fermi level calculated without the on - site coulomb interaction , gives rise to a pronounced contribution to the anomalous hall conductivity , and thus the absence of the small x@xmath14 hole pocket in the gga+u band structure is also the main cause for the significant reduction of the calculated anomalous hall conductivity .    in fig .",
    "3 , we display the anomalous hall conductivity ( @xmath0 ) and the number of valence electrons ( @xmath4 ) as a function of the fermi level ( @xmath5 ) , together with the relativistic band structure , from the gga+u calculations using @xmath1 ev and @xmath2 ev . the fine @xmath34-point mesh of @xmath37 is used . clearly , the magnitude of the @xmath0 peaks just above the true fermi level ( @xmath47 ev ) , with a large value of -1420 @xmath12@xmath13 at @xmath48 ev ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the peak may be related to the flat band ( band 10 ) along the w - l-@xmath50 line near the l point just above the fermi level ( see fig . 3a ) .",
    "as the fermi level is further artificially raised , the size of the @xmath0 decreases steadily and becomes rather small ( within 200 @xmath12@xmath13 ) above 0.75 ev .",
    "when the @xmath5 is artificially lowered , the magnitude of the @xmath0 initially decreases gradually , and then drops sharply starting at @xmath51 ev .",
    "the resultant shoulder at -0.35 ev can be attributed to the presence of the top segment of band 8 near the x ( y , z ) point in this energy region ( see fig .",
    "the @xmath0 then changes its sign at -0.38 ev ( or @xmath52 ) .",
    "as the @xmath5 is further lowered , the @xmath0 increases sharply and then peaks at -0.74 ev ( or @xmath53 ) with a large value of 2635 @xmath12@xmath13 . beyond this point , the @xmath0 decreases and fluctuates but remains positive as the @xmath5 is further lowered , and it then changes its sign again at -2.28 ev ( or @xmath54 ) . for the @xmath5 being below -3.80 ev",
    ", the magnitude of the @xmath0 is small .",
    "note that the energy bands below -4.0 ev and above 0.5 ev are predominantly of @xmath55 character and thus the effects of the soi and exchange interaction are small .",
    "experimentally , the measured anomalous hall resistivity @xmath56 is often analysized in terms of two distinctly different resistivity ( @xmath57)-dependent terms@xcite , i.e. , @xmath58 .",
    "since usually @xmath59 , the total anomalous hall conductivity @xmath60 , where the first linear @xmath61-dependent term ( @xmath62 ) was attributed to the extrinsic skew scattering mechanism ( @xmath63)@xcite . the skew scattering contribution has been found to become dominant in dilute impurity metals at low temperatures.@xcite indeed , recent _ ab initio _",
    "calculations for the alloy systems fe@xmath64pd@xmath65 and ni@xmath64pd@xmath65 indicated that in the small pd concentration @xmath10 region , the @xmath63 can be several times larger than the @xmath66 , and can also differ in sign.@xcite the second scattering - independent term @xmath66 was usually further separated into the intrinsic contribution @xmath0@xcite which can be obtained from band structure calculations@xcite , as done here for nickel , and also the extrinsic side jump mechanism ( @xmath67)@xcite . therefore ,",
    "when one compares the calculated @xmath0 with the experimental scattering - independent term @xmath66 , one should be aware of the possible side jump contribution @xmath67 even though it has been shown that the @xmath0 would dominate in ferromagnet metals such as fe and co@xcite .",
    "recent theoretical calculations for the 2d rashba and 3d luttinger hamiltonians using a gaussian disorder model potential suggested that the ahe in the ( iii , mn)v ferromagnetic semiconductors at low temperatures could be dominated by the @xmath67.@xcite however , more recent _ ab initio _ calculations show that in fcc fe@xmath64pd@xmath65 and ni@xmath64pd@xmath65 , the @xmath67 is generally two - order of magnitude smaller than both the @xmath63 and @xmath0 , thus being negligible.@xcite this is consistent with the recent experimental finding of the negligible @xmath67 in bcc fe@xcite and fcc ni@xcite using a newly established empirical @xmath61-scaling formula for @xmath68@xcite .",
    "let us now return to the calculated @xmath0 as a function of the @xmath5 described above and also presented in fig .",
    "we find that it can explain qualitatively within the rigid band approximation the known ahe experiments on 3@xmath3 transition metal ferromagnets and their alloys.@xcite for example , the sign of the @xmath0 of both fe and co were found to be positive.@xcite interestingly , the calculated @xmath0 at @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ev ) is 758 @xmath12@xmath13 , being in very good agreement with the previous _ ab initio _ calculations for fe@xcite .",
    "of course , this nearly perfect agreement may be accidental because fe crystallizes in the bcc structure and also has a much larger spin magnetic moment , and hence the rigid band model should not work very well here .",
    "we note that the calculated @xmath0 is 2548 @xmath12@xmath13 at @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ev ) , which is much larger than the previous theoretical @xmath0 value for fcc co@xcite and also the experimental @xmath0 value for polycrystalline hcp co@xcite .",
    "nickel forms substitutional alloys in fcc structure with low concentration of fe , co and cu . the present calculations ( fig .",
    "3 ) predict that fcc ni@xmath8co(fe , cu)@xmath9 alloys ( @xmath10 being small ) would have the negative intrinsic @xmath0 with the magnitude being in the range of @xmath11 @xmath12@xmath13 .",
    "of course , when comparing this prediction with the ahe experiments on fcc ni@xmath8co(fe , cu)@xmath9 alloys , one should take into accoint the non - negligible skew scattering contribution @xmath63@xcite .",
    "indeed , as mentioned earlier , fig .",
    "3b shows a sign change of @xmath0 at @xmath73 ( @xmath6 ev ) , whereas the sign change of the @xmath68 in fcc ni@xmath64fe@xmath9 alloys with @xmath74 ( i.e. , @xmath75 ) was experimentally found@xcite .",
    "this experimentally found sign change at the lower fe concentration could be attributed to the presence of the positive @xmath63 in fcc ni@xmath64fe@xmath9 alloys .    as mentioned before , the most pronounced effect of including",
    "the on - site coulomb interaction is that all the @xmath3-dominant bands are lowered in energy relative to the @xmath5 by about 0.3 ev .",
    "consequently , the down - spin band 8 is now pushed completely below the @xmath5 and the small x@xmath14 hole pocket disappears .",
    "now the top of band 8 is located at -0.20 ev on the x(y , z ) point ( figs",

    "the remarkable difference in the @xmath0 at 0.0 ev from the gga and gga+u calculations can be attributed to the presence of the above mentioned x@xmath14 hole pocket in the gga calculation ( fig .",
    "another major difference is the absence of the clear shoulder at -0.35 ev in the gga @xmath0 spectrum .",

    "3 shows that as the @xmath5 is lowered from the true fermi level ( 0 ev ) , the gga @xmath0 decreases in magnitude steeply to zero and changes its sign at -0.30 ev ( @xmath76 ) . nevertheless , in both cases , the @xmath0 changes its sign near @xmath77 . the other pronounced difference ( by about 700 @xmath12@xmath13 ) in the two calculated @xmath0 spectra",
    "is the height of the positive peak near -0.70 ev . in the rest of the energy region ,",
    "the two @xmath0 spectra look rather similar .",
