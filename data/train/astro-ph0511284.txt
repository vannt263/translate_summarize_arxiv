    "the cumulative stellar mass loss from the stars in an early - type galaxy is typically 0.1 - 3 m@xmath6 yr@xmath7 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which , integrated over a hubble time , is comparable to the gaseous mass of a spiral galaxy .",
    "the absence of a massive disk of cool atomic and molecular gas in early - type galaxies indicates a different life cycle for the gas , which may be divided into distinct stages .",
    "ignoring accretion onto a galaxy , the first stage is mass loss from the stars , a process that can be measured by detecting the infrared signature associated with the stellar winds of red giants .",
    "the measurement of this process successfully detects the infrared emission near 10 @xmath11 m and yields a value for the mass loss rate that is approximately the value predicted from theoretical stellar evolution models @xcite .",
    "the stellar ejecta will not remain in orbit around its star because the expanding ejecta will eventually collide with the ejecta from other stars , undergoing shocks that convert their random orbital motion to thermal energy ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this process heats the gas to 10@xmath12 -10@xmath13 k , and if there were no additional heating or cooling , the gas would be bound to the galaxy and have the same spatial distribution as the stars .",
    "however , the radiative cooling time for the gas is less than a hubble time , so the gas will evolve with time , and this is the basis of the cooling flow model . in the absence of a heating mechanism , radiative cooling drains energy from the gas most rapidly at small radii , causing a loss of buoyancy and a subsequent inflow of gas .",
    "then , the rate at which gas cools and flows inward ( @xmath10 ) is proportional to two observed quantities , the energy loss rate ( @xmath14 ) divided by the thermal energy per gram ( @xmath15 ) , or @xmath10",
    "@xmath16 @xmath14/@xmath17 , typically 0.03 - 3 m@xmath6 yr@xmath7 for ellipticals ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the location at which the gas cools ( to 10@xmath3 k or cooler ) depends upon a free parameter in this _ standard _ cooling flow picture .",
    "picture does not include heating effects by supernovae , which will make profound changes , since the net cooling rate is given by @xmath10 @xmath16 ( @xmath14-_h_)/@xmath17 , where _ h _ is a heating component . in principle , the rate at which cool gas is produced can be reduced to zero .",
    "if one uses the recent values for the supernova rate in early - type galaxies ( @xcite ; a factor of three lower than the older tammann and sandage rates ; @xcite ) , the characteristic temperature of the ism would be 1@xmath010@xmath13 k , which is about the escape temperature for a typical elliptical galaxy ( @xmath18 @xmath2 0.3@xmath19 ) .",
    "more detailed hydrodynamic calculations @xcite show that galactic winds ( or partial galactic winds ) will play an important role in the evolution of the hot gas even if the supernova heating rate is lower than that implied by @xcite .",
    "a galactic wind carries away nearly all of its energy rather than radiating it , substantially lowering the x - ray luminosity .",
    "not only is a galactic wind important for understanding the x - ray emission and the ism in the galaxy , it has implications for the surrounding intergalactic medium , as this is the primary way that it becomes polluted with metals .",
    "the x - ray emission surveys of early - type galaxies show that there can be a wide range in the mass and luminosity of x - ray emitting gas for galaxies of similar optical properties ( e.g. , @xcite ) . this variation , along with the trend of rapidly decreasing @xmath14 with decreasing optical luminosity @xmath18 , can be understood if galactic winds play a role in some systems ( other systems may have accretion from their surrounding region ; review by @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the prediction is that the systems with large x - ray gas masses and short cooling times ( high @xmath14 ) should have cooling flows while the x - ray poor systems have partial or total galactic winds , so the cooling flow will be weak or absent in those systems .    because the heating rate is not well known",
    ", it is difficult to determine the net cooling rate through x - ray luminosity measurements .",
    "alternatively , if gas is cooling to lower temperatures , emission lines will be produced that are indicative of those lower temperatures .",
    "the best lines for this test are from ovi because this ionization state dominates the total radiative cooling as the gas passes through the 2 - 4@xmath010@xmath8 k range @xcite .",
    "the primary cooling lines come from the doublet at @xmath20@xmath201032 , 1038  , which is accessible with the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( _ fuse _ ) .",
    "calculations show that there is a linear relationship between the line luminosity and the cooling rate , which is insensitive to the metallicity of the gas or whether the gas is out of collisional ionization equilibrium @xcite . at 10@xmath21 k ,",
    "the radiative cooling rate per unit volume is significantly higher than at the temperature of the x - ray emitting gas ( 10@xmath12 - 10@xmath13 k ) , so the relative contribution of a heating mechanism is greatly reduced and can be ignored .",
    "therefore , the luminosity of the ovi doublet should be a direct measure of the gas cooling rate , @xmath22 .",
    "previously , we reported upon ovi observations of two early - type galaxies , ngc 1404 and ngc 4636 @xcite , two of the x - ray luminous galaxies widely believed to host cooling flows . for ngc 1404 , ovi was not detected and the upper limit is several times below the standard cooling flow prediction , based on _ rosat _ data .",
    "however , ovi emission was detected from ngc 4636 , and the luminosity of these lines corresponds to a cooling rate of 0.4 m@xmath6 yr@xmath7 .",
    "this is less than the total rate from the cooling flow model of 2 m@xmath6 yr@xmath7 , but the _ fuse _ aperture ( a 30@xmath23 square aperture , or an effective radius of about 17@xmath23 ) only takes in a part of the galaxy . correcting for the flux that falls outside the aperture is a model - dependent procedure , but if one uses a model with distributed mass drop out ( _ q_=1 from @xcite ) , the corrected ovi luminosity approximately equals the cooling flow prediction .",
    "following on this work , we began a ovi emission line survey of an unbiased sample of nearby early - type galaxies .",
    "the basic observations define the emission line characteristics of the sample , and permit us to test a few predictions of the model .",
    "one would expect that the x - ray faint galaxies would be very weak ovi emitters , if most of the thermal energy is being carried away in galactic winds .",
    "secondly , the galaxies with significant hot gas masses should usually possess ovi emission .",
    "we defined a sample of optically selected early - type galaxies in order to be unbiased with respect to x - ray properties . in previous work with _ rosat _",
    "observations @xcite , we developed a complete optically selected sample of early - type galaxies , which contains the optically brightest elliptical galaxies ( by total apparent magnitude ) in the @xcite sample that do not have agns pointing at us , are not at low galactic latitude , and excluding dwarf galaxies and cd systems .",
    "this sample of 33 galaxies have been studied extensively in the optical region and were observed at x - ray energies with _ rosat_. most of the objects in the sample were observed more recently with _",
    "chandra_. this sample was accepted as a program on _ fuse _ , and nearly all were observed , with only one exception due to the pointing constraints following the reaction wheel failure .",
    "the redshift range of the sample is -250 km s@xmath7 to 1950 km s@xmath7 , and the apparent magnitude range is 9.3 - 11.0 ( in b ) ; for completeness , we included m87 .",
    "the optical properties and exposure times are given in table 1 , where we list the galaxy name , absolute blue magnitude , r@xmath24 , one - dimensional stellar velocity dispersion , extinction in b , distance ( in km s@xmath7 and mpc , total exposure time , and night exposure time ( boldface denotes the data used ) .",
    "the raw _ fuse _ data were processed using the pipeline calfuse 2.2.1 , 2.4 , and 3.0 , usually with very little change between the data sets .",
    "we inspected each of the data sets to determine whether using the night - only data was superior to using the total data set ( night plus day data ) .",
    "the decisions depended partly on the redshift of the galaxy since the weaker ovi line at @xmath201037.62 can be redshifted into any of three airglow lines at 1039.2  , 1040.8  , and 1041.6   at about 450 km s@xmath7 , 920 km s@xmath7 , and 1150 km s@xmath7 .",
    "these airglow lines are about 100 km s@xmath7 wide and can shift relative to the source depending upon the placement in the slit .",
    "the ratio of these airglow lines , and relative to the stronger one at 1027.3 , allows us to estimate the degree to which contamination occurs . also , there is a dead spot in the detector that covers part of the spectrum near 1043   and this sometimes produces artifacts in the spectrum ( false absorption or emission features ) , so we inspect this wavelength region closely in the event that an emission line is found nearby ( the weaker ovi lines occurs here for redshifts of 1500 - 1600 km s@xmath7 )",
    ".    there are four detectors that cover this wavelength region , two lif channels and two sic channels , but the effective area is significantly better for the lif channels .",
    "also , the lif1a channel is significantly better than the lif2b channel and we find that adding this second channel generally reduces the s / n , so we usually rely upon the lif1a data for the region covering the ovi lines . we inspect the other channels for confirmation of features . the other important emission line in the _ fuse _ band is from ciii @xmath20977.02 , which is covered by the two sic channels , with the sic2a being the best .",
    "sometimes there is an offset in the wavelength scale , and when this is an issue , we mention it and use the strong atomic absorption line , cii @xmath201036.34 to realign the spectrum .",
    "the spectra from early - type galaxies have several components that need to be modeled or recognized when trying to determine ovi line strengths .",
    "given the redshift range of our objects , the ovi lines fall in the region 1030 - 1045  , but these lines are superimposed upon the continuum of the host galaxy , plus there is absorption by milky way gas , and there are airglow lines ( discussed above ) , all of which are taken into account when analyzing line strengths .    the underlying stellar spectrum of the host galaxy was modeled in this spectral region by @xcite in order to analyze _",
    "hopkins ultraviolet telescope _ ( _ hut _ ) data , which have a resolution of about 3  , significantly worse than _",
    "fuse_. when we compare their model spectrum to the stellar continuum from ngc 1399 , the galaxy with the brightest continuum , we find that the model reproduces the general properties of the spectrum .",
    "however , there are aspects of the spectrum that depart from the model , and since the s / n is good for ngc 1399 , we choose to use it as the template spectrum for other objects .",
    "there are important absorption lines , produced by the milky way , superimposed upon the observed spectra of these external galaxies . the strongest atomic line in the spectral range 1028 - 1053    is cii @xmath201036.34 , which is always optically thick .",
    "this is followed in line strength by oi @xmath201039.23 , ari @xmath201048.22 , and the galactic ovi lines .",
    "in addition to atomic absorption lines , there can be absorption by molecular lines , although the strength of this component can vary greatly , from being absent ( at our typical s / n ) to being optically thick .",
    "the lines occur in bands , one occurring in the 1036 - 1039   region and another that occurs in the 1048.5 - 1052   region .",
    "the three strongest lines in the group at 1036 - 1039   are centered at 1036.54  , 1037.15  , and 1038.16  , the first of which can blend with the atomic line of cii @xmath201036.34 .",
    "these atomic and molecular lines can absorb part or all of an ovi emission line from the external galaxy if the redshift coincidence is unfortunate .",
    "we show the location of these absorption components in the figures for the spectra , but we do not determine their absorption equivalent widths , as this generally does not bear upon the analysis .",
    "to extract line fluxes or upper limits , we defined the continuum for about 5   on either side of the line , along the shape of the stellar continuum ; over this narrow range , the continuum is nearly a simple slanted line . to determine the line flux , we integrated over the line , but to determine the fwhm , a gaussian was fit .",
    "the location of the continuum is one of the main contributors to the uncertainty of the line flux , so the continuum location was varied ( @xmath25 1@xmath26 ) to determine the errors in the line flux and line width . when the line flux was less than 3@xmath26 , we consider it a non - detection and quote an upper limit of 3@xmath26 .",
    "the individual objects are discussed , beginning with ngc 1399 , which was used as the stellar template . extracted fluxes or upper limits to the ovi lines are given in table 2 , and for the detections , possible detections , and most upper limits , the spectra are shown ( some non - detections are largely noise so we do not show their spectra ) . for uniformity , and to avoid the strong geocoronal ly@xmath27 airglow line , we show the 1028 - 1053   region in our figures of all objects .",
    "the spectra were binned by five pixels to a bin size of 0.034   ( 9.8 km s@xmath7 at the ovi lines ) and then smoothed by five , seven , or 11 for the purposes of producing the figures shown below ; line fluxes were extracted from the unsmoothed data .",
    "the reddenings quoted below are from @xcite , the galacitc hi column density is from @xcite , and other galaxy properties ( e.g. , redshift ) are taken from the _ nasa / ipac extragalactic data base_.    ngc 1399 : this galaxy has the brightest stellar continuum , typically an order of magnitude brighter than other systems . as with other galaxies in the fornax cluster ( ngc 1316 ,",

    "the lack of h@xmath30 absorption simplifies the determination of the location of the continuum and we see no evidence for ovi emission . due to the absence of ovi emission and the strength of the continuum",
    ", we use the stellar continuum as the standard template for the other systems , after filling in the galactic absorption lines ( for guidance , we used the model by @xcite ) .",
    "ngc 1316 : this is also known as fornax a , a radio galaxy in the fornax cluster , and one of the optically most luminous galaxies in the cluster .",
    "it is also a liner with weak low ionization emission lines , extended ionized and neutral gas , and some evidence of dust .",
    "the system has a low galactic extinction and low galactic hi column ( 1.9@xmath010@xmath28 @xmath29 ) , so the absence of detectable galactic h@xmath30 is expected .",
    "the _ fuse _ lif1a spectrum ( figure 2 ) shows emission from the strong line of ovi ( @xmath201032 ) .",
    "there is weaker emission from the ovi ( @xmath201038 ) line , also seen in the lif2b channel . the sharp feature that is coincident with ly@xmath27 for ngc 1316 and the ovi ( @xmath201032 ) line from the milky way is not confirmed in the lif2b channel and",
    "may not be real ( also , the higher series ly lines are not seen ) .",
    "in addition , there is emission from the ciii ( @xmath20977 ) line at the redshift of ngc 1316 ( sic2a and sic1a channels ) .",
    "the two ovi lines and the ciii line have the same fwhm of about 1.5   ( 440 km sec@xmath7 ) , which is comparable to the fwhm that one would infer from the one - dimensional velocity dispersion of the stars in ngc 1316 ( 223 km s@xmath7 , which would lead to a fwhm of 525 km s@xmath7 ) .",

    "ngc 1395 : galactic absorption is present but there is little h@xmath30 absorption ( about 10@xmath31 @xmath29 ) and there is no evidence for galactic ovi emission , which would be difficult to detect in this short observation .",
    "the strong ovi line from ngc 1395 would lie at 1037.84  , a fairly clean part of the spectrum ; there is only an upper limit to this line ( figure 3 ) .",
    "ngc 1404 : like the other fornax galaxies , h@xmath30 absorption is nearly absent , and in this observation , using night data , there airglow lines are nearly absent as well ( figure 4 ) ; the usual galactic atomic absorption lines are apparent ( presented and discussed in @xcite ) .",

    "the stronger ovi line from ngc 1407 ( 1038.1  ) corresponds to the location of a galactic h@xmath30 line , although not one of the strongest ones , but there is no apparent emission , nor is there emission at the location of the weaker ovi line ( figure 5 ) .    ngc 1549 :",

    "consequently , the airglow lines are strong .",
    "absorption by galactic atomic and molecular gas is nearly absent , which is surprising given the column density of the gas .",
    "due to the absence of the strong galactic c ii , ar i and fe ii ( 1063.18  ) lines , we do not believe this to be a reliable spectrum .",

    "this is one of the more distant objects , so the continuum is fairly faint but is well - fit by the stellar continuum of ngc 1399 ( figure 23 ) .",
    "both the strong and weak redshifted ovi lines appear to be present , but not in the expected 2:1 ratio ( for ovi @xmath201032 to ovi @xmath201038 ) .",
    "the ovi @xmath201032 line is broken up by galactic molecular absorption features , so it could be significantly stronger .",
    "we can not fit the h@xmath30 parameters well enough to make an accurate absorption correction for the ovi @xmath201032 line .",
    "the usually weaker ovi @xmath201038 line ( redshifted to 1043.6  ) falls close to a feature in the detector . whereas this feature is stationary and well - known",
    ", we have seen instances of unusual absorption or emission near it , and this may contribute to the strength of this feature .",
    "the spectra in the lif2b channel , while poorer , confirms the presence of the ovi @xmath201032 line but not the ovi @xmath201038 line .",
    "consequently , we estimate the ovi luminosity from the ovi @xmath201032 line . there is emission from the ciii @xmath20977 line at a flux of 7.7@xmath010@xmath36 erg @xmath29 sec@xmath7 ( 15% error ) , with a line width of 1.0@xmath250.1    and a line center of 982.87   ( at the systemic redshift ,",

    "the airglow lines are strong during the daytime observing , so although only 25% of the observing time was at night ( only 2.5 ksec ) , the night - time data are better for the analysis of the ovi region , while the total data set is better for analysis in the ciii region .",
    "there is a broad emission line coincident with the strong redshifted ovi line , which is relatively uncontaminated by galactic absorption features ( also present in the lif2b channel ) .",
    "the weaker ovi line is not detected at a statistically significant level , but as it is half the strength of the ovi @xmath201032 line , this is not inconsistent with a detection of the ovi @xmath201032 line .",
    "the ciii @xmath20977 line is also detected with a flux that is poorly determined because it is unclear where to mark the boundaries of the line .",
    "if we use the single peak , to the blue of line center , the line width is 0.8   ( line flux of 1.3@xmath010@xmath36 erg @xmath29 sec@xmath7 ) and a line center at 982.0   ( expected to be at 982.5  ) .",
    "if we use the weaker red part of the line as well , the line center is exactly that expected for the recession velocity , the line width becomes 2.1   ( at a line flux of 2.1@xmath010@xmath36 erg @xmath29 sec@xmath7 ) .",
    "given the uncertainties associated with each of the lines , it is difficult to compare the ovi and ciii lines .",
    "this galaxy has a strong radio source and is known to be a liner .",
    "an important goal of the program is to test whether the x - ray cooling rate is a good predictor of the true cooling rate , which would be reflected in the ovi line luminosity , presumed to be a better measure of the net cooling rate .",
    "there certainly is not a one - to - one relationship between the x - ray value of @xmath22 ( @xmath10 ) and the ovi value of @xmath22 ( @xmath9 ) , such as for the galaxies ngc 1399 and ngc 1404 , two of the most x - ray luminous sources but with no detectable ovi emission .",
    "however , there are statistical correlations between the x - ray and ovi cooling rates .    for the analysis of our sample",
    ", we have summarized the results in table 3 , where we give a variety of x - ray and optical properties , along with the ovi results .",
    "the measure of a detection is given by either upper limits , detections , or possible detections .",
    "the detections are lines whose strength exceeds 3@xmath26 and where the signal appears clearly on the spectrum .",
    "possible detections are generally near 3@xmath26 threshold or where it has been difficult to establish the presence of the line unambiguously .",
    "there are a variety of issues , such as contamination from galactic absorption line , airglow features , or uncertainties in the level of the underlying stellar continuum . for the purposes of scoring the detections in a simple non - parametic fashion , we assign 0 to upper limits , 0.5 to possible detections , and 1.0 to detections .",
    "the conversion of the ovi luminosity to a cooling rate ( @xmath9 ) has been calculated by @xcite and by @xcite , and here we use the conversion l(1032 ) = 9@xmath010@xmath37 @xmath9 erg / sec , where @xmath9 is in m@xmath6 yr@xmath7 ( as used in bmi ) .",
    "this is probably accurate to 30% , where the uncertainty derives from issues such as whether the cooling gas is isobaric or isochoric .",
    "this is most likely an uncertainty in the absolute calibration and is unlikely to cause an additional random scatter of 30% .",
    "the quantity @xmath9 is fairly insensitive to the metallicity provided that the metals remain the primary cooling agent ( edgar and chevalier 1986 ) . in the temperature range where ovi is the most prominent ion ( near 10@xmath21 k ) , this requirement is satisfied for metallicities greater than 10@xmath38 of the solar value ( see @xcite ) .    we wish to compare the ovi cooling rate to the x - ray cooling rate within the _ fuse _ aperture , and this depends somewhat on whether gas cools primarily in the center or in a distributed manner throughout the galaxy .",
    "effectively , the x - ray cooling rate is @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the net cooling rate ( the x - ray luminosity , if there is no opposing heat source ) and e is the specific thermal energy of the gas .",
    "the factor @xmath41 represents the model correction due to fluid effects , such as gravitational reheating as gas flows inward or a sink of mass as gas cools out of the flow , which can be extracted from model calculations , such as @xcite .",
    "we discussed the differences between the predictions in the various models previously ( bmi ) and here we use the value @xmath41 = 0.4 , corresponding to the _ q _ = 1 model . in this",
    "_ q _ = 1 model , gas loss is distributed through the galaxy in the sense that hot gas is converted locally to cold gas at a rate inversely proportional to the instantaneous cooling time @xmath42 as given by @xmath43 .",
    "there is a second consideration in calculating @xmath10 , having to do with the _ fuse _ aperture , a square 30@xmath23 on a side , or an effective radius of 17@xmath23 .",
    "this is smaller than the effective optical radius ( r@xmath44 , typically 30 - 60@xmath23 ) or of the extent of the x - ray emission , which is similar to the optical size .",
    "if we were to adopt the cooling flow model without mass drop out , all of the cooling would occur within the _ fuse _ aperture ( although this makes an x - ray surface brightness profile that is too sharply peaked in the center ) .",
    "if there is mass drop - out with radius , then we need to correct for only enclosing part of the cooling gas in the _ fuse _ aperture .",
    "as described in bmi , this is accomplished by multiplying the total @xmath10 by the fraction of the x - ray luminosity projected into the _ fuse _ aperture .",
    "here we use the value of @xmath10 for the distributed model ( _ q=1 _ ) , corrected to the size of the _ fuse _ aperture .",
    "if we had used the model with no mass drop - out ( _ q=0 _ ) , the median predicted value of @xmath10 hardly changes , although for the most x - ray luminous galaxies in the sample ( often the largest ) , the predicted @xmath10 could be a factor of two higher .",
    "the various values of @xmath22 and other relevant derived quantities , including the x - ray luminosity , @xmath4 , and the x - ray temperature , @xmath5 are given in table 3 .",
    "there is a complete set of _ rosat _ x - ray fluxes and luminosities for this sample , so we begin by comparing these to the ovi data . the nominal prediction was that there would be a connection between @xmath10 and the detection of ovi emission , but we examined other relationships as well .",
    "some of those relationships investigated were between ovi and @xmath4 , @xmath45 , and @xmath5 , where no strong correlations were found and no strong relationships were predicted",
    ". however , there seems to be a correlation between the ovi and @xmath10 , as seen in figure 25 .",
    "we see that none of the six galaxies with the lowest values of @xmath10 have any ovi emission , yet the significance of this correlation is difficult to quantify .",
    "we would like to use the kaplan - meier estimator for the analysis of censored data @xcite , but an underlying assumption is that the data are censored randomly . here ,",
    "the upper limits ( censored data ) are not randomly distributed , but preferentially occur at the lower values of @xmath10 .",
    "also , we have introduced `` possible '' detections , which is difficult to incorporate in statistical schemes .",
    "given these challenges , we can divide the sample into three bins by @xmath10 , using our scoring for detections , possible detections , and upper limits .",
    "we find that for galaxies with the lowest @xmath10 values , 1/8 have ovi , while 4.5/8 of the highest @xmath10 objects have ovi ( and 3.5/8 of the intermediate objects have ovi ) .",
    "using poisson statistics , the joint probability that of the lowest @xmath10 objects , 1/8 ( or fewer ) have ovi while 4.5/8 ( or more ) of the highest @xmath10 objects have ovi would occur by chance 2.5% of the time ( 97.5% confidence level ) .",
    "the correlation is probably a bit stronger than this value since none of the lowest six @xmath10 object have either an ovi detection or possible detection . for a kendall s @xmath46 test or a spearman s @xmath47 test for the whole sample ( treating upper limits and detections equally ) , the significance improves to 98 - 99.5% confidence , with the higher significance if the very poor upper limit object , ngc 3585 is eliminated from the sample .",
    "conservatively , we conclude that the correlation exists at the 98% confidence level when using the _ rosat _ data .",
    "a correlation is suggested between the ovi detectability and the radio luminosity , where the lowest third ( in @xmath48 ) has 1.5/8 ovi detections , the middle third has 3/8 and the most luminous third has 4.5/8 ovi detections . when we divide the sample in halves instead of thirds , for the low radio luminosity group , only 1.5/12 have ovi detections while 7.5/12 of the radio luminous objects have ovi emission .",
    "this correlation is significant at the 93% confidence level ( using poisson statistics ) , so more objects would be required to confirm this result .",
    "if the correlation is real , it could be caused if the cooling gas eventually feeds the radio source , although there is not a good correlation between @xmath10 and @xmath48 .",
    "alternatively , it might be possible for the agn to heat the gas and produce ovi emission , and four of the radio luminous objects have ciii emission as well , although this could be consistent with cooling gas also .",
    "the _ chandra _ data offer a number of advantages in determining x - ray properties , relative to the _ rosat _ data .",
    "first , the point sources can be removed from the observations , and a correction can be made for the unresolved point source contribution , yielding a more accurate measure of the properties of the x - ray emitting gas @xcite .",
    "the most important observational quantities used to calculate @xmath10 are @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( @xmath49 ) , with the surface brightness distribution , usually described by a @xmath27 model , being of less importance .",
    "chandra _ data not only provide better values for @xmath4 , but also for @xmath5 and for the @xmath27 model as well . however , the values of @xmath5 are typically in the range of 0.3 - 0.8 kev , so it is important to have observations that cover this low energy range adequately , and this is provided by the acis - s chip , which has sensitivity to 0.3 kev .",
    "the other detector used for imaging , acis - i , is three times less sensitive in the 0.5 - 1 kev range , it is insensitive below 0.5 kev , and it was subject to radiation damage during the early part of the mission .",
    "for these reasons , we do not include acis - i data in this program for galaxies where _ rosat _ data indicated that @xmath5 @xmath50 0.5 kev .",
    "this affects two objects , ngc 1395 and ngc 3607 , which are excluded from this analysis , making 22 objects with useful _",
    "chandra _ and _ fuse _ data .",
    "this sample includes acis - i data for ngc 4486 ( m87 ) , a hotter galaxy , and we used the values given in the work of @xcite .    using the _ chandra _ data , the relationship between @xmath9 and @xmath10 is little changed ( figure 26 ) .",
    "the objects with the lowest values of @xmath10 are smaller in the _ chandra _ data due to the removal of the x - ray point sources .",
    "the significance of the correlation is a bit lower for the _ chandra _ data , mainly because of having two fewer objects ( 95% confidence of a correlation ) .",
    "the nominal cooling flow prediction is that there should be a relationship between @xmath9 and @xmath10 , but the relationship should be @xmath9 @xmath51 @xmath10 .",
    "this is nearly the case for the _ rosat _ data and is almost the case for the _ chandra _ data , save @xmath10 appears to be about 20 - 30% too large , which is within the uncertainties in the model predictions .",
    "the more important discrepancy with the models is the very large scatter of @xmath9 for a fixed @xmath10 ( the dispersion of the relationship ) .",
    "this occurs because there are several x - ray bright galaxies without ovi emission , such as ngc 4649 ( the upper limit on @xmath9 is 5 times less than the prediction ) , ngc 1399 ( 2.6 time less than the prediction ) and ngc 3923 ( 2 times below the prediction ) .",
    "these differences are much greater than the statistical uncertainties in the data .",
    "also , there are some galaxies in which ovi is surprisingly bright : ic 1459 lies an order of magnitude above the predicted @xmath9 , ncg 1549 is five times above the prediction ; and ngc 1316 is four times above the predicted value . even if one were to suggest that an agn were responsible for the high values of ovi , we are still left with the objects that are much fainter than predicted .",
    "this broad dispersion about the relationship could be caused if cooling flows varied in time , as has been suggested for the cluster case ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "heating by an agn could reheat the gas , choking off the cooling flow .",
    "if that were the case , one might expect that , in the moderate and high @xmath10 objects without ovi emission , the gas temperature would be above the velocity dispersion temperature , indicating that net heating is occurring . similarly , the ovi emitters , at similar values of @xmath10 , should have temperatures at or below the stellar velocity dispersion temperature .",
    "however , we find no such trend in the data supporting this picture nor is there any correlation between the detection of ovi and @xmath17 @xmath26@xmath38 for the entire sample . also , one might expect a division by radio properties , assuming that this is a proxy for agn activity . yet",
    "the objects furthest above the line , @xmath9 = @xmath10 , are not obviously different in their radio properties than those furthest below that line .",
    "therefore , within the context of the cooling flow picture , time variation in the flow rate is necessary to explain the ovi detection properties , yet we do not find telltale signs that should accompany intermittent heating .",
    "another possibility is that the ovi emission is not a result of cooling gas , but a result of gas being heated , such as by thermal conduction .",
    "however , there is a very large difference in the emission line strength between gas that is radiatively cooling and gas that is being conductively heated .",
    "this difference , which is typically a factor of 10@xmath52 - 10@xmath53 ( canizares et al .",
    "1993 ) , means that to achieve the same line flux for conductively heated gas , the mass flux rate would have to be typically 10@xmath54 - 10@xmath52 m@xmath6 yr@xmath7 instead of a cooling rate of 0.1 - 1 m@xmath6 yr@xmath7 .",
    "if this cold gaseous reservoir is hi or h@xmath30 , the mass would have to be less than typical upper limits for the galaxies in this sample , about 10@xmath55 m@xmath6 , with some galaxies having significantly stricter upper limits @xcite . at a conduction rate of 10@xmath56 m@xmath6 yr@xmath7 , this would lead to a lifetime for the cold gas reservoir of 10@xmath1 yr , so the gas would have to be replenished every 10@xmath1 yr by the amount of gas found in galaxies about one - tenth the mass of the milky way .",
    "the orbital interaction time would be about 10@xmath57 yr , so we should see many of these galaxies passing through the early - type galaxy , which is not the case .",
    "consequently , it seems unlikely that conductive heating of gas could produce the lines that we observe .",
    "a final issue is whether the gas is undergoing simple radiative cooling or whether turbulent mixing layers play a role @xcite . in this case",
    ", the mixing would be between the hot ambient medium and gas that has already cooled , and this process can cause gas to spend less time at a given temperature compared to the pure radiative model . this has been suggested as a process within cluster cooling flows in order to remain consistent with the discrepancy between the observed and predicted strength of the x - ray ovii line within the cooling flow model ( fabian et al .",
    "2001 ) . a similar discrepancy exists for ngc 4636 , where the ovii line is weaker than expected for gas cooling at the rate derived from the _ fuse _ data ( xu et al .",
    "if turbulent mixing causes gas to effectively jump over the ovii temperature region ( @xmath58 10@xmath1 k ) , it could solve this issue , but it also makes the prediction that there will be emission from the civ @xmath20 1550 line at a luminosity greater than the ovi doublet .",
    "unfortunately , there is presently no instrument that can measure the civ @xmath20 1550 line with the required sensitivity .",
    "the use of ovi emission has given a new insight into the properties of the hot gas in early - type galaxies , and this study highlights the need for further investigations .",
    "the greatest need is for a substantial increase in sensitivity , since most of the galaxies were not detected and even the detections are typically at the 3 - 5@xmath26 level . for objects with short exposure times ( @xmath50 5 ksec )",
    ", it should be possible to double or even triple the s / n with moderate investments of observing time ( this applies to six objects in the sample , four of which are detections or possible detections ) .",
    "the other objects generally have exposure times of 5 - 10 ksec , requiring an additional 15 - 30 ksec per object ( generally of night data ) to double the s / n . for the objects with upper limits ,",
    "improving the s / n by 2 - 3 will not make these objects secure detections even if there is a weak feature present .",
    "improved studies of these objects , or of more distant sources will require a new instrument with at least an order of magnitude greater sensitivity .",
    "this instrumental goal should be achievable as _ fuse _ is a rather small instrument by the standards of any space - based optical telescope ( or even most x - ray telescopes ) .",
    "we would like to thank the _ fuse _ team for their assistance in the collection and reduction of these data , and in particular , b - g andersson for his patience in dealing with many data reduction issues .",
