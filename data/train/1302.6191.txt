    "the study of approximate degree has enabled progress in circuit complexity @xcite , quantum computing ( where it has been used to prove lower bounds on quantum query complexity , e.g. @xcite ) , communication complexity @xcite , and computational learning theory ( where approximate degree upper bounds underly the best known algorithms for pac learning dnf formulas and agnostically learning disjunctions ) @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we seek to advance our understanding of this fundamental complexity measure .",
    "we focus on proving approximate degree lower bounds by specifying explicit _ dual polynomials _ , which are dual solutions to a certain linear program capturing the approximate degree of any function .",
    "these polynomials act as certificates of the high approximate degree of a function .",
    "their construction is of interest because these dual objects have been used recently to resolve several long - standing open problems in communication complexity ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "see the survey of sherstov @xcite for an excellent overview of this body of literature .    * our contributions .",
    "* our first result resolves the approximate degree of the function @xmath7 , showing this quantity is @xmath8 .",
    "known as the two - level and - or tree , @xmath2 is the simplest function whose approximate degree was not previously characterized .",
    "a series of works spanning nearly two decades proved incrementally larger lower bounds on the approximate degree of this function , and this question was recently re - posed by aaronson in a tutorial at focs 2008 @xcite .",
    "our proof not only yields a tight lower bound , but it specifies an explicit dual polynomial for the high approximate degree of @xmath2 , answering a question of palek @xcite in the affirmative .",
    "our second result gives an explicit dual polynomial witnessing the high approximate degree of any _ symmetric _ boolean function , recovering a well - known result of paturi @xcite .",
    "our solution builds on work of palek @xcite , who gave an explicit dual polynomial for the or function , and addresses an open question from that work .",
    "our final contribution is to reprove several classical markov - type inequalities from approximation theory .",
    "these inequalities bound the derivative of a polynomial in terms of its degree . combined with the well - known symmetrization technique ( see e.g. @xcite ) , markov - type inequalties have traditionally been the primary tool used to prove approximate degree lower bounds on boolean functions ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "our proofs of these inequalities specify explicit dual solutions to a natural linear program ( that differs from the one used to prove our first two results ) .",
    "while these inequalities have been known for over a century @xcite , to the best of our knowledge our proof technique is novel , and we believe it sheds new light on these results .",
    "we work with boolean functions @xmath1 under the standard convention that 1 corresponds to logical false , and @xmath9 corresponds to logical true .",
    "we let @xmath10 denote the @xmath3 norm of @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath0-approximate degree of a function @xmath11 , denoted @xmath12 , is the minimum ( total ) degree of any real polynomial @xmath13 such that @xmath14 , i.e. @xmath15 for all @xmath16 .",
    "we use @xmath17 to denote @xmath18 , and use this to refer to the _ approximate degree _ of a function without qualification .",

    "in addition to approximate degree , _ block sensitivity _ is also an important measure of the complexity of a boolean function .",
    "we introduce this measure because functions with low block sensitivity are an `` easy case '' in the analysis of theorem [ thm : andor ] below .",
    "the block sensitivity @xmath27 of a boolean function @xmath28 at the point @xmath29 is the maximum number of pairwise disjoint subsets @xmath30 such that @xmath31 here , @xmath32 denotes the vector obtained from @xmath29 by negating each entry whose index is in @xmath33 .",
