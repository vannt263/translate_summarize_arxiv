    "@xcite , we investigated in particular the gogny case .",
    "a few previous studies concerning the tensor force in the gogny interaction existed in the literature @xcite . in both studies",

    "isospin term .",

    "@xcite was employed in ref .",
    "@xcite to analyze neutron ",
    "proton tensor effects on some single  particle spectra . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we discussed the need of introducing not only a tensor ",
    "isospin term , but also a pure tensor term .",
    "this allowed us to adjust independently the neutron ",
    "proton and the like  particle tensor contributions in the gogny case , as was already done with the skyrme force .    since tensor and spin ",
    "orbit effects are strictly connected in modifying single ",
    "particle splittings along isotopic and isotonic chains , the importance of refitting simultaneously also the spin ",
    "orbit parameter was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , for both skyrme and gogny cases .",
    "a three  step procedure @xcite was employed by fitting the neutron @xmath1 spin ",
    "orbit splitting in the nuclei @xmath7ca , @xmath11ca , and @xmath12ni .",
    "the first nucleus , which is spin  saturated , was used to adjust the spin  orbit parameter ; the nucleus @xmath11ca , which is spin  saturated in protons , was used to adjust the like  particle tensor contribution ; finally , the nucleus @xmath12ni , which is unsaturated , was used to adjust the neutron  proton contribution .",
    "this three ",
    "step procedure was useful for identifying reasonable signs and regions of values for the tensor parameters in the associated mean ",
    "field models and , more importantly , for excluding those signs and regions of values that could not provide the correct phenomenological trends .",
    "we proposed three sets for the skyrme force starting from the existing parametrizations sly5 @xcite , siii @xcite , and t@xmath13 @xcite , and one set for the gogny force starting from the existing parametrization d1s @xcite . in all cases ,",
    "also the spin  orbit parameters were modified with respect to the original values .",
    "the new parameters are reported in table iii of ref .",
    "one of these parametrizations was recently employed to analyze the magicity of the nuclei @xmath14ca and @xmath15ca @xcite , and a good agreement with the corresponding experimental findings @xcite was found .",
    "tensor  induced and pure spin  orbit effects can not be easily disentangled one from the other , because the tensor force has an effect on the spin ",
    "orbit splittings in all spin  unsaturated nuclei .",
    "tensor contributions may have for these systems a relevant impact on increasing or reducing such splittings .",
    "recently , one case was investigated experimentally to isolate effects produced only by the spin  orbit force , without any tensor  induced contributions :",
    "@xmath4 transfer reactions were performed to extract the neutron @xmath0 and @xmath1 splittings in the nuclei @xmath2s and @xmath3si @xcite . in both nuclei",
    ", we expect tensor effects to be practically the same , because the only difference between them is the filling of the proton @xmath16 orbital .",
    "consequently , if some difference is measured in the splittings , it may be unambiguously related to a modification of the potential generated by the spin ",
    "orbit force .",
    "some years ago , a strong charge  density depletion ( between 25% and 30% ) was predicted in the interior of the nucleus @xmath9si @xcite .",
    "this depletion , not predicted in the nucleus @xmath8s , is simply related to the fact that the proton @xmath16 orbital is not occupied in the nucleus @xmath9si , whereas it is filled in the nucleus @xmath8s . since the spin  orbit potential can be written in terms of derivatives of the nuclear densities , a strong depletion of the density in the center of the nucleus is expected to have an important impact mostly on the splitting of low@xmath17 spin  orbit partners , whose wave funstions are more concentrated in the internal region .",
    "this is illustratred in ref .",
    "@xcite , that is , a reduction of the neutron @xmath0 spin ",
    "orbit splitting from @xmath2s to @xmath3si : by using the major fragments to evaluate the spin ",
    "orbit splittings , the experimental values reported in ref . @xcite are 2 and 1.1 mev in the nuclei @xmath2s and @xmath3si , respectively , that means a reduction of 45% .",
    "this value was however corrected and reduced after performing shell  model calculations to include correlation effects .",
    "on the other side , the results of ref .",
    "@xcite do not allow us to draw precise conclusions for the @xmath10 splitting : the 1@xmath18 state is represented by three fragments in the nucleus @xmath2s ( with a quite low associated spectroscopic factor equal to 0.36 ) , and is spread in a region of about 1 mev in the nucleus @xmath3si ( with a low associated spectroscopic factor of 0.32 ) .    for the @xmath5 case , this measurement represents a direct and reliable insight into the spin  orbit potential ( without any tensor-induced effects ) .",
    "it is also an indirect confirmation of the theoretical prediction of ref .",
    "@xcite , about the strong central depletion of the charge density in the nucleus @xmath9si .    in this work ,",
    "we use ( i ) the original sly5 and d1s forces , ( ii ) the tensor parametrization of ref .",
    "@xcite for the skyrme case and one gogny parametrization of ref .",

    "orbit effects on the neutron @xmath0 and @xmath1 splittings in the @xmath6 isotones @xmath7ca , @xmath8s , and @xmath9si .",
    "the case ( ii ) is an example of parametrizations where the spin ",
    "orbit parameter is not fitted simultaneously with the tensor parameters , whereas in the case ( iii ) spin  orbit and tensor parameters are adjusted together .",
    "we perform hartree - fock ( hf ) calculations to focus our attention only on pure mean  field effects .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present the results and identify pure and tensor  induced contributions .",
    "conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "in the adopted mean  field theory , two contributions may be identified to the single  particle spin  orbit splittings ; one depends on the spin ",
    "orbit force with a strength related to the spin ",
    "orbit parameter of the used effective force ; the other is produced by the tensor force with two parameters that describe like  particle and neutron  proton effects . in the skyrme case",
    ", it is well known that the last contribution is generated by the so  called @xmath19 terms in the hamiltonian density , where @xmath20 is the spin  orbit density .",
    "this contribution is written as the sum of two parts , one related to central  exchange terms ( and depending on standard skyrme parameters ) , the other describing genuine tensor effects with two parameters . in many skyrme parametrizations",
    "the @xmath19 terms are neglected in the hamiltonian density . for the original sly5 case , the terms coming from the central ",
    "exchange contribution are included , whereas the pure tensor terms are neglected .",
    "mean  field models can not describe the fragmentation of single  particle states .",
    "each single  particle state is concentrated at a unique value of the energy . to reasonably compare our energies with the experimental values",
    ", we can thus only use the experimental centroids .",
    "we remind that in ref .",
    "@xcite the shown experimental energies do not correspond to the centroids , but to the main peaks .",
    "we can not thus directly compare our results with them .",
    "furthermore , our occupation probabilities are by construction equal to 1 for the occupied states and to 0 for the empty states in hf , and we can not thus describe any spectroscopic factors .",
    "we will concentrate our analysis on the energies of the states and we will compare them with the experimental centroids , in those cases where they are available .",
    "as a first application , we perform calculations by using the original sly5 and d1s forces . the obtained results for the neutron @xmath0 and @xmath1 spin  orbit splittings are presented in figs .",
    "[ sly5fig ] and [ d1sfig ] for the skyrme and gogny cases , respectively .",

    "they are represented by red dashed lines in figs .",
    "[ sly5fig](a ) and [ d1sfig](a ) .",
    "first , we observe that the @xmath5 and @xmath10 splittings calculated for @xmath7ca with the skyrme and gogny forces are too large with respect to the experimental values .",
    "going from @xmath7ca to @xmath8s , they are weakly reduced .",
    "such reductions are not produced by any tensor contributions because such contributions are absent in these calculations .",
    "a stronger reduction is found for the @xmath5 splitting going from @xmath8s to @xmath9si , 40% ( 43% ) with sly5 ( d1s ) .",
    "this important reduction is related to a pure spin ",
    "orbit effect , that affects much more @xmath5 than @xmath10 states because @xmath5 states are more concentrated in the central region of the nucleus where the variation of the spin  orbit potential is located , due to the charge ",
    "density depletion in the nucleus @xmath9si .",
    "the reduction of the @xmath10 splitting is smaller , 26% ( 20% ) with sly5 ( d1s ) .",
    "the state @xmath21 in the nucleus @xmath8s , and the states @xmath21 and @xmath22 in the nucleus @xmath9si are not bound in the skyrme case . in the gogny case , in addition",

    ", we have performed calculations using a box discretization with an increasing box radius , equal to 20 , 40 , and 60 fm .",
    "the estimation of the energies has been done by combining the following criteria : the energies of single  particle resonant states are expected to be weakly affected by the modification of the box radius , within their width ; these states have wave  function radial profiles similar to those of bound states , except in the region far from the nucleus .    , @xmath22 , and @xmath21 , with respect to the energy of the neutron state @xmath24 , located at zero .",

    "tensor effects are taken into account , and the spin ",
    "orbit parameter is equal to that of the original forces .",
    "the results found for @xmath7ca are almost the same as those obtained in the previous case because this nucleus is spin saturated .",
    "the splitting reduction found from @xmath7ca to @xmath8s is more important than that found in the previous case , because neutron ",
    "proton tensor effects are now taken into account .",
    "the reduction is 14% ( 28% ) for the @xmath10 case and 28% ( 40% ) for the @xmath5 case with sly5@xmath25 ( d1st@xmath26 ) .",

    "proton tensor contribution , from @xmath7ca to @xmath8s , and the one produced by pure spin  orbit effects , from @xmath8s to @xmath9si , are more pronounced for @xmath5 than for @xmath10 states . from @xmath8s to @xmath9si",
    ", this fact was already associated to the modification of the spin  orbit potential in the center of the nucleus @xmath9si , with a more important overlap with @xmath5 than with @xmath10 wave functions .",
    "the reduction from @xmath7ca to @xmath8s , on the other side , is related to neutron ",
    "proton tensor effects ( the proton @xmath29 orbital is filled in @xmath7ca and empty in @xmath8s ) . as an illustration",
    ", we analyze the nuclei @xmath7ca and @xmath8s with the parametrization sly5@xmath27 .",
    "it is known that the spin  orbit potential in the skyrme ",
    "mean  field approach is expressed as the sum of two terms ; one is produced by the spin ",
    "orbit force , depends on the derivatives of the densities , and is tuned by the spin ",
    "orbit parameter ; the second one is induced by the tensor force , depends on the spin ",
    "orbit densities , and is tuned by the tensor parameters .",
    "we plot in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ pote ] some spin  orbit potentials for the two nuclei .",
    "for @xmath7ca , only the total spin  orbit potential is shown because it coincides with the pure spin ",
    "orbit contribution , the tensor contribution being negligible in this saturated nucleus . for @xmath8s",
    ", we display the total potential , together with the spin  orbit and tensor contributions . for this nucleus , the tensor ",
    "induced contribution is produced by a spin ",
    "orbit density constructed predominantly with the proton @xmath30 wave function .",
    "this contribution has the opposite sign compared to that coming from the spin ",
    "orbit force , and produces a total potential which is reduced with respect to the pure spin ",
    "orbit part .",
    "the volume localization of such reduction is related to the localization of the @xmath30 wave function .",
    "the net result is that the total potential for the nucleus @xmath8s is lower than that for the nucleus @xmath7ca .    in the lower panel of the figure",
    ", we show the squares of the wave functions for the neutron states @xmath21 and @xmath22 , as an illustration , in the nucleus @xmath7ca .",
    "it turns out that the two total spin",
    " orbit potentials ( for @xmath7ca and @xmath8s ) have a stronger overlap with the @xmath10 wave function than with the @xmath5 wave function .",
    "owing to the reduction of the potential from @xmath7ca to @xmath8s , both overlaps are decreased generating a reduction of both splittings from @xmath7ca to @xmath8s .",
    "however , the overlap reduction is more important for the @xmath5 ( 22% ) than for the @xmath10 wave function ( 13% ) .",
    "this explains why the splitting is predicted more strongly reduced for @xmath5 than for @xmath10 states .",
    "it is clear that this prediction depends in our model on the sign of the tensor parameter governing the neutron ",
    "proton contribution . with a different sign of the corresponding tensor parameter , the total spin  orbit potential",
    "would be increased instead of reduced passing from @xmath7ca to @xmath8s , and both splittings would be larger in @xmath8s than in @xmath7ca .",
    "let us concentrate now on the splitting reductions related to tensor  induced effects , that is , from @xmath7ca to @xmath8s . in this case , the reductions are very small with the interactions d1s and sly5 because the tensor force is absent there .",
    "we observe that both @xmath5 and @xmath10 splittings are increased in the skyrme case , passing from sly@xmath25 to sly@xmath27 , and reduced in the gogny case , passing from d1st@xmath26 to d1st@xmath28 .",
    "this occurs because the parameter governing the neutron ",
    "proton tensor contribution is larger in sly@xmath27 compared to sly@xmath25 , and smaller in d1st@xmath28 compared to d1st@xmath26 .    for the reduction of the splitting related to the pure spin  orbit force , from @xmath8s to @xmath9si , we have found in all cases a reduction of about 40% for @xmath5 states and of about 20% for @xmath10 states .",
    "these reductions do not seem strongly affected by the specific values of the parameters .",
    "even if such reductions are predicted to be almost the same with all the employed interactions , we observe that only for the last case , sly@xmath27 and d1st@xmath28 , the starting point is correct , that is , the splittings are correctly reproduced in the nucleus @xmath7ca with respect to the experimental values .     but with the interaction sly@xmath27 .",

    "the 40% reduction of the @xmath5 splitting is comparable to the experimental finding ( before correction for correlations ) even if such comparison is not completely meaningful because the experimental energies refer to the major fragments",
    ". it would be interesting to have all the experimental values for the centroids in the nuclei @xmath2s and @xmath3si , to compare with our results .",
    "furthermore , having the centroids for the @xmath10 states would permit to validate our prediction on the stronger reduction of the @xmath5 ( compared to the @xmath10 ) splitting in all cases , from @xmath7ca to @xmath8s ( mostly tensor effects ) , and from @xmath8s to @xmath9si ( mostly pure spin ",
    "orbit effects ) .",
    "we have computed neutron @xmath0 and @xmath1 spin  orbit splittings in the isotones @xmath7ca , @xmath8s , and @xmath9si , by using mean  field approaches based on skyrme and gogny forces .",
    "we have used three types of interactions , ( i ) without tensor contributions , ( ii ) with tensor contributions and with tensor parameters adjusted on top of existing parametrizations , ( iii ) with the tensor force and with tensor parameters adjusted together with the spin ",
    "orbit parameter .",
    "our conclusions can be directly drawn from table i. for all the interactions , we predict a reduction of both splittings passing from @xmath7ca to @xmath8s and from @xmath8s to @xmath9si . from @xmath7ca to @xmath8s , the reduction of the splittings is related to neutron ",
    "proton tensor  induced effects and can be easily understood by analyzing the strengths of the parameters tuning the neutron ",
    "proton tensor contribution in each case .",
    "this explains why this reduction is very small for the interactions of type ( i ) , where the tensor force is not included .",
    "this reduction is stronger for the @xmath5 splitting than for the @xmath10 splitting and the reasons for it , related to the overlap modifications between the spin ",
    "orbit potentials and the wave functions , were analyzed in sec .",
    "ii . from @xmath8s to @xmath9si , the reduction is predominantly coming from the spin  orbit force .",
    "this reduction is of about 40% for the @xmath5 case and of about 20% for the @xmath10 case .",
    "again , the @xmath5 reduction is stronger and this can be easily understood as due to the central charge  density depletion in the nucleus @xmath9si .",
    "this depletion is concentrated in the center of the nucleus where @xmath5 wave functions are more localized than @xmath10 wave functions . in our model ,",
    "the predicted @xmath5 reduction is of about 40% .",
    "this reduction can not be directly compared with the value reported in ref .",
    "@xcite because such value is obtained by using the main fragments and not the centroids .",
    "we stress once again that the comparison between centroids and major fragments may be indeed quite misleading in those cases where such values are very different one from the other , owing to a strong fragmentation of the strength .",
    "this was shown for instance in the experimental results presented in ref .",
    "the measurement of the centroids in @xmath8s and @xmath9si would provide values that we could more properly compare with our results .",
    "in particular , one could verify our prediction on the stronger @xmath0 reductions ( both from @xmath7ca to @xmath8s and from @xmath8s to @xmath9si ) , compared to the @xmath1 reductions .",
