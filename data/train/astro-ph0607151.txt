    "sdss j121209.31 + 013627.7 ( hereafter sdss 1212 ) was first reported by @xcite as a magnetic white dwarf with an equivalent dipolar magnetic field of @xmath6 = 13  mg .",
    "recently , @xcite published a new study suggesting that sdss 1212 is a white dwarf / probable brown dwarf binary .",
    "their follow - up spectroscopy revealed the presence of a narrow h@xmath7 emission line with a semi - amplitude radial velocity variation of @xmath8  km  @xmath9 and an orbital period of @xmath10 minutes , indicating the presence of a nearby irradiated companion .",
    "the h@xmath7 emission disappeared when the companion faced the white dwarf , suggesting a high inclination orbit . from the zeeman splitting of hydrogen absorption lines in the photosphere , @xcite measured a mean magnetic surface field of 7  mg .",
    "their @xmath11band photometry yielded @xmath12 mag , placing an upper limit on the mass of the companion and thus suggesting the brown dwarf scenario .    in this @xmath13 , we present near - infrared @xmath0 observations of sdss 1212 , aimed at detecting the brown dwarf companion and determining the presence or absence of eclipses of the white dwarf .",
    "we observed sdss 1212 in @xmath0 over five nights , 2006 february 15 and 17 ut , with the wirc camera on the 2.5 m dupont telescope and from 2006 june 4 to june 7 ut with the panic camera on the 6.5 m baade telescope at las campanas observatory , chile .",
    "the near - infrared filter set at las campanas ( lco system ) is described by @xcite .    with wirc , we observed sdss  1212 with @xmath141 minute sampling in all three filters , observing in @xmath2 for 84 minutes and @xmath3 for 15 minutes .",
    "the second night we observed in @xmath2 and @xmath4 for 80 minutes and in @xmath3 for 15 minutes .",
    "our panic observations sampled sdss  1212 every 30  s for all three filters , with observations spanning @xmath14120 minutes for each filter .",
    "typical seeing over the five nights ranged from 0@xmath156 to 1@xmath153 .",
    "we used a five point dither pattern for each data set .",
    "the images were processed using standard iraf routines or equivalent idl programs .",
    "each frame was flat - fielded , background subtracted , and bad - pixel corrected .",
    "we then performed simultaneous differential aperture photometry on each image of sdss 1212 and comparison stars in the field .",
    "all of the comparisons behaved similarly , showing no individual photometric variation trends over the time span of the observations .",
    "we derived differential magnitude light curves for each comparison using aperture sizes that were approximately equal to the width of the seeing and averaged them to obtain the final light curves .",
    "we used six comparison stars in the images .",
    "the 2mass apparent magnitudes of those stars are summarized in table [ tab : photometry ] .",
    "our dithering pattern precluded all six stars from being present in every frame .",
    "the panic data had three of the comparison stars , due to its smaller field of view .",
    "for each night we took two bright comparison stars in the field to calculate the absolute photometry of sdss 1212 , based on their 2mass photometry .",
    "the final @xmath0 photometry is presented in table  [ tab : stub ] . transforming the",
    "comparison star 2mass photometry into the lco system gives values that are the same within the photometric errors @xcite .",
    "the light curves of sdss 1212 were folded using the ephemeris equation @xmath16    where we have adopted the orbital period of 0.061@xmath50.001 days derived by finding a period that minimized the phased point - to - point variations in our @xmath4 lightcurves @xcite .",
    "we have chosen the mid - point of the magnitude dip observed in @xmath1band ( see below ) as phase 0 .",
    "the phased light curves from all nights are shown in figure [ fig : lightcurve ] .    the @xmath2 and @xmath3 light curves appear featureless up to the one standard deviation precision level of our photometry ( @xmath14 0.07 mags for @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) , which precludes eclipses deeper than 0.2 mag . however , there is a marginally detected dip in the @xmath3 curve at a phase of 0.5 which appears in both nights of data .",
    "the emission of sdss 1212 in @xmath11band is dominated by the white dwarf , therefore , if eclipses were present , one would clearly observe the primary eclipse ( occultation of the white dwarf by the companion ) , but the eclipse of the secondary would still be undetectable . a white dwarf with a typical radius @xmath17 in an edge - on ( @xmath18 = 90 deg ) configuration with a @xmath19 brown dwarf would produce a @xmath145 min eclipse of the white dwarf . using the most recent version of the wilson - devinney program ( wd2003 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we generated model light curves for a range of inclinations and radii of the secondary , keeping the white dwarf radius and the orbital separation fixed , and compared the results to the light curve in @xmath11band to conclude that the inclination of the system is constrained to @xmath18 @xmath20 deg .",
    "the @xmath1band light curve is marked by a flat dip which lasts for @xmath14 41 minutes .",
    "that dip is followed by a brightening of the system by @xmath14 0.7 mag , with a second dip at a phase of 0.5 .",
    "the light curve variations of sdss 1212 in @xmath1band are reminiscent of those detected in the ultrashort period ( @xmath21 minutes ) polar ef eri by @xcite .",
    "those variations were initially attributed to a cool irradiated companion with the side facing the white dwarf at a higher temperature . however , that interpretation was refuted in @xcite after they failed to detect phase - dependent spectral line changes that an irradiated companion would produce in the infrared spectrum of the system .",
    "they concluded that cyclotron emission is responsible for the photometric variability observed in ef eri .",
    "in addition , the @xmath11band light curve of ef eri presents a @xmath14 0.5 mag sinusoidal variation that has been attributed to a bright spot on the white dwarf . as of 10 march",
    "2006 , ef eri returned to its high state @xcite .    however , the sdss 1212 light curves differ from those of ef eri .",
    "there is no sign of sinusoidal variation in @xmath11band , which indicates the absence of an accretion spot on the white dwarf .",
    "the @xmath1band light curves show a sharp drop in magnitude followed by the flat dip , unlike the sinusoidal changes observed in ef eri .",
    "this suggests that , whatever the source of the extra emission in @xmath1band is , it originates in a more localized region that is being obscured during the dimmer phases .",
    "given that the @xmath11band light curve is flat , we derived an apparent magnitude of @xmath22 by averaging over all phases . similarly , there appears to be no significant variability in the @xmath23band , and we measure @xmath24  mag . in @xmath1band we derived two values for the total flux . the first value , @xmath25  mag , corresponds to the average magnitude of the system between phases @xmath26 ( @xmath27 @xmath28 ) , where we are detecting emission from the white dwarf , its companion , and any additional radiation present in the system .",
    "the second value , @xmath29 mag , was computed as the average magnitude between phases @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( @xmath27 @xmath32 ) which corresponds to the white dwarf and the companion being visible .",
    "the resultant spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of sdss 1212 is shown in figure [ fig : sed ] .",
    "the diamonds correspond to the average flux of the system in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xmath33 bands @xcite and the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 photometry in @xmath27 @xmath32 , when sdss 1212 is dimmer .",
    "the open square represents the average @xmath4 flux of the system during the brighter phase of @xmath27 @xmath28 .",
    "the flux of sdss 1212 from the optical to @xmath2 is reproduced by a blackbody model of a single white dwarf with an effective temperature of about 10,000 k ( see solid line in figure [ fig : sed ] ) , in agreement with the conclusion reached by @xcite .",
    "our @xmath3 and @xmath1band data , on the other hand , clearly show infrared excess in each one of the stages considered above .",
    "therefore , we conclude that there is a substellar companion , most likely of middle to late l spectral type and with t@xmath34  k. the amount of infrared excess can be determined in each case by subtracting the predicted white dwarf flux at each wavelength band .",
    "the main uncertainty in this procedure is the poorly known temperature of the white dwarf . to estimate the flux of the white dwarf we use a @xmath35",
    "we estimate the formal error introduced into the measurement of the excess by taking the differences in predicted flux at @xmath0 and scaling them to the measured flux of the system at @xmath2 . in @xmath2 , there is no significant excess , so we take a 3@xmath36 upper limit , where we calculate @xmath37 .",
    "the resultant apparent magnitudes of the near - ir excess are j@xmath38 , @xmath3=19.2@xmath50.2 , and @xmath4=16.9@xmath50.1 , for @xmath27 @xmath28 , and 18.2@xmath50.3 for @xmath27 @xmath32 .    in order to determine whether the excess in @xmath27 @xmath32 is consistent with flux solely coming from the white dwarf s companion",
    ", we compare the apparent magnitudes of the excess to the mean absolute magnitudes of field brown dwarfs with measured parallaxes @xcite . assuming a distance to sdss 1212 of 145  pc results in an excess with absolute magnitudes in @xmath39 , and @xmath4 of @xmath4013.8 , 13.4@xmath50.2 , and 12.4@xmath50.3 respectively .",
    "these absolute magnitudes match with a spectral type of l7 .",
    "sdss 1212 s distance is uncertain by 14% and is based on theoretical modeling of the white dwarf s atmosphere .",
    "this uncertainty translates an error of @xmath51 spectral type .",
    "figure [ fig : sed ] shows a comparison of the observed sdss  1212 photometry ( diamonds ) and the combination of the expected wd fluxes and those from an l7 brown dwarf ( dashed line ) . by definition",
    ", the model does nt fit the observed photometry in the @xmath2-band since we are assuming a 3@xmath41 upper limit .",
    "there are two possible explanations for the sdss  1212 lightcurve : ( 1 ) the excess emission is due to a hotter irradiated side of the companion , or ( 2 ) the excess is produced by a separate mechanism , such as cyclotron emission .    in the case of irradiation , the sdss 1212 system would appear brighter during the phases when the hot side of the companion is facing towards us , with its brightness dropping once per orbit as the hot side of the companion faces away from us .",
    "the difference in flux between @xmath27 @xmath28 and @xmath27 @xmath32 is approximately a factor of 1.5 . assuming flux from two pure blackbodies",
    ", one would expect the temperature ratio between the hot and the cool sides of the companion to account for this difference to be @xmath42 .",
    "we attempted to model the @xmath39 , and @xmath1band light curves of sdss 1212 with wd2003 adopting various irradiation scenarios with effective temperatures of the secondary down to 600k and assuming that the secondary co - rotates with the white dwarf in its orbit .",
    "the values of the orbital period and initial epoch of the light curves were adopted from equation 1 .",
    "we assumed a mass of @xmath43 , a radius of @xmath44 and a @xmath45 of 10,000k for the white dwarf .",
    "the mass of the companion was set to @xmath46 , and the radius to the size of its roche lobe , although there is no sign of undergoing accretion , as reported by @xcite .",
    "the values used for the albedos and the limb darkening and gravity brightening coefficients are the same as those adopted by @xcite in their irradiation models of ef eri .",
    "the model providing the closest resemblance to the light curves corresponds to a @xmath45 = 1000k brown dwarf with a 1400k irradiated side .",
    "that model is represented by the dashed line in figure [ fig : lightcurve ] .",
    "clearly , irradiation alone can not reproduce the observed light curves , since the irradiation curves produce a smooth rounded drop in flux which does not match the sharpness and the depth of the drop .    in the second scenario ,",
    "cyclotron emission associated with the magnetic pole region of the white dwarf causes excess flux in @xmath4 .",
    "other magnetic white dwarf binaries , such as ef eri , exhibit strong cyclotron features even in the absence of accretion features @xcite .",
    "we postulate that the majority of the cyclotron emission is confined to a spot near the magnetic pole of the white dwarf and is obscured by the white dwarf when it rotates out of view . given a total excess above the white dwarf and its companion of 0.08 mjy , the cyclotron emission would have an approximate luminosity of @xmath47  ergs s@xmath48 .",
    "this is a lower limit on the total luminosity caused by accretion of a wind from the companion and the inferred mass accretion rate would be 4@xmath49m@xmath50 yr@xmath48 , assuming a white dwarf mass of 0.6 , and a white dwarf radius of 0.01 r@xmath51 . assuming a magnetic field strength of 13 mg , the cyclotron emission observed at the wavelength of 2.06  corresponds to a harmonic number of 4 .",
    "cyclotron emission should be present at 4.1 and 8.2 accessible in _",
    "spitzer s _ irac channels 2 and 4 .",
    "we have generated a simple geometric model of a spot on the white dwarf to model the observed light curve .",
    "our model includes the sum of the @xmath52band white dwarf+companion flux plus the flux from the spot as a function of spin phase .",
    "we assume that the spot is not affected by limb darkening relative to the disk of the white dwarf . the radius of the spot , the flux ratio of the spot to the white dwarf+companion , and the latitude of the spot s position are free parameters .",
    "the results are mostly insensitive to spot radius or latitude assuming that the spot is close to the equator and the spot radius is @xmath5310% of the white dwarf radius .",
    "we assume a flux ratio of spot to white dwarf of 1.5 , which is derived from the difference in flux due to the dip compared to that expected from the white dwarf alone .",
    "the solid line in figure [ fig : lightcurve ] shows our results for a model with a spot of radius 0.03 r@xmath54 , located at the equator .",
    "the bottom diagram shows the residuals from this model .",
    "some structure still remains visible in those residuals , e.g. the dip around phase 0.5 , which could be caused by beaming of the cyclotron emission , self - shielding of the cyclotron emission column that presents less surface area as it points towards earth , or an eclipse of the emission region by the companion .",
    "overall , our simplistic cyclotron emission model provides a good first order approximation to the @xmath4 light curve .",
    "we report the detection of the brown dwarf companion to the magnetic white dwarf sdss 121209.31 + 013627.7 , whose presence was inferred by the detection of a variable @xmath55 emission line by @xcite .",
    "we provide a more accurate period for the system of 0.061@xmath50.001 days .",
    "no eclipses are apparent , however our data constrain the inclination of the system to @xmath20 deg .",
    "we are only able to place an upper limit of l7 to the spectral type of the companion , given that the @xmath1band photometry appears to be contaminated by an additional source .",
    "we propose cyclotron radiation as the most likely cause of the extra emission , although our hypothesis requires phase - resolved infrared spectroscopy to be confirmed .",
    "spectroscopy will reveal the presence or absence of cyclotron radiation peaks and determine the spectral type of the companion .",
    "it is possible that high - precision @xmath2 and @xmath3-band photometry may reveal a shallow eclipse or other subtle structure in the light curves .",
    "sdss  1212 shows no evidence of ongoing accretion from roche - lobe overflow , and may differ from similar objects , like ef eri , by being a pre - polar system @xcite .",
    "finally , high resolution optical spectra of sdss  1212 will better measure the radial velocity variations of the h@xmath56 line and link the variations with those observed in @xmath4 .",
    "measuring the radial velocity of the white dwarf through its hydrogen lines will be difficult given the high probability that changes in the projected mean field strength will erase any signature from the companion .",
    "high resolution spectroscopy will also provide a direct measure of any material that is accreted onto the white dwarf evidenced by the presence of weak metal lines .",
    "magnetic white dwarf binaries can efficiently capture the stellar wind of their companions and radiate the accretion energy entirely in cyclotron emission @xcite .",
    "metal lines in daz white dwarfs have proved useful for measuring low levels of mass accretion onto isolated white dwarfs and white dwarfs with close companions and would provide an independent measure of the material accreted by the white dwarf . @xcite .",
