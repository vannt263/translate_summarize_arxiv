    "recently it has been shown both experimentally and theoretically that charge order in la@xmath4ba@xmath5cuo@xmath6 at @xmath7 decouples the cu  o planes leading to 2d superconductivity intimately connected to spin stripe order@xcite .",
    "this contrasts with the stripe - ordered nickelates la@xmath4sr@xmath5nio@xmath8",
    "( lsno)@xcite , in which the charge - stripe ordering on adjacent ni  o planes is correlated@xcite .",
    "inter - layer correlations in lsno are facilitated by a combination of a strong electron ",
    "phonon coupling , which is also responsible for the insulating nature of this material@xcite , and coulomb repulsions , which cause the stripes to run parallel to one another on adjacent layers and which control the stacking of the stripes .",
    "however , the relative importance of the factors which control the inter - layer correlations in lsno have not been investigated in detail .",
    "charge - stripe order in lsno occurs over a wide doping range@xcite and is relatively well correlated ( @xmath9  in the ni  o plane ) .",
    "the order is static on the timescales of diffraction probes @xcite .",
    "on cooling , the doped holes order into ni@xmath10 stripes orientated at 45@xmath11 to the ni ",
    "o bonds in the ni  o layers . at a lower temperature ,",
    "antiferromagnetic order of the ni@xmath12 spins develops with the charge stripes acting as anti - phase domain walls for the magnetic order .",
    "spin degrees of freedom also exist on the ni@xmath10 sites , but coupling between these and the magnetic order of the ni@xmath12 spins , frustrates ni@xmath10 spin ordering@xcite .",
    "the in - plane period of the charge order is given by @xmath13 lattice units , where @xmath14 .",
    "stripes running along the @xmath15 $ ] diagonal give rise to charge - order diffraction peaks at positions @xmath16 in reciprocal space , where @xmath17 are integers and @xmath18 is an odd integer .",
    "the corresponding magnetic bragg reflections occur at @xmath19 .",
    "the tetragonal crystal structure means that stripes running along the @xmath20 $ ] diagonal are equally likely , and an equal population of both types of stripe domains occurs in practice . in lsno",
    "the charge stripes are thought to be predominately predominately ni - centred but with some oxygen character@xcite .",
    "the temperature evolution of the in - plane stripe order has been reported in several studies @xcite , but the out - of - plane order is much less well characterised@xcite . when the average in - plane periodicity @xmath13 is incommensurate the stripe pattern is described by the introduction of discommensurations into a commensurate stripe order @xcite .",
    "there are no correlations between discommensurations in adjacent ni  o layers @xcite . in the case of @xmath15 $ ] stripes",
    ", the basic body centred stacking of the stripes along the @xmath21 axis tends to give rise to magnetic peaks with @xmath18 an odd integer .",
    "however , even - integer @xmath18 magnetic peaks are sometimes observed as well , and these are thought to be due to stacking faults along the @xmath21 direction .",
    "evidence for this is the observation that the @xmath22 even reflections are broader in the out - of - plane direction than the @xmath18 = odd reflections@xcite . hence , the correlation lengths for the @xmath22 odd and @xmath22 even mangetic peaks carry information on the coherence of the magnetic order along the @xmath21 direction .",
    "correlation lengths of the spin order are larger than those of the charge order as the coherence of the order in the domains is disrupted by mainly elastic deformations@xcite .",
    "here we report on a study of the temperature dependence of the incommensurate magnetic order in stripe - ordered la@xmath4sr@xmath5nio@xmath8 with @xmath23 .",
    "we find that on warming from base temperature the magnetic bragg reflections @xmath24 in the out - of - plane direction above 70k , with the sharpening of the @xmath3 even reflections being significantly greater than that of the @xmath3 odd reflections .",
    "we show that it is necessary to take this unusual broadening into account in order to arrive at a consistent picture of the physics of la@xmath4sr@xmath5nio@xmath8 .",

    "the properties of the present crystal are consistent with those of stoichiometric lsno @xmath23 samples studied by ourselves and others@xcite .",
    "neutron diffraction measurements were performed on the cold triple - axis spectrometer ( tas ) rita ii at the p.s.i . and the thermal tas in3 at the i.l.l . on both instruments",
    "the initial and final neutron energies were selected by pyrolytic graphite vertically - focusing monochromators , a vertically - focusing analyzer on in3 and a flat analyzer on rita ii .",
    "higher - order harmonics were suppressed after the sample and before the analyzer by use of a liquid nitrogen - cooled be filter on rita ii and a pg filter on in3 .",
    "on in3 the horizontal divergence of the neutrons was constrained by 30 ' and 20 ' collimators placed in the incident and scattered beams respectively .",

    "in figure [ fig : hhdirection](a ) we show magnetic bragg reflections from la@xmath0sr@xmath1nio@xmath35 , measured along @xmath36 at two positions in reciprocal space , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the data are consistent with the general position @xmath19 with @xmath39 .",
    "the slight difference in the centering of the two peaks is due to imperfect alignment of the crystals ( @xmath40 ) in the cryomagnet which could not be tilted .",
    "the ordered moments of this compound have previously been found to lie in the @xmath41 plane@xcite .",

    "consistent with previous observations , on warming @xmath47 remains constant up to 110k , then tends to a value of @xmath48 as the magnetic order melts at @xmath49k @xcite .",
    "the small difference between the values of @xmath47 measured at @xmath42 and @xmath43 is partly caused by the sample tilt mentioned above , but the increase in the discrepancy at @xmath50k is probably because the sample temperature was not perfectly in equilibrium during the two measurements .",
    "the temperature variation of the resolution corrected widths of the magnetic bragg reflections measured in @xmath51 scans is shown in the inset of figure [ fig : hhdirection](b ) .",
    "instrument resolution was estimated using the widths of nearby structural bragg reflections .",

    "the @xmath43 magnetic bragg reflection sharpens by @xmath53% between 40k and 110k above which it broadens as the spin ordering temperature is approached . for the @xmath43 reflection ,",
    "between 40k and 110k the peak slightly sharpens by @xmath54 .    in fig .",

    "the ratio of the intensities of the @xmath42 and @xmath43 peaks is expected to remain constant , but it actually decreases between 40k and @xmath49k .",
    "next we describe the temperature dependence of different magnetic bragg reflections in scans parallel to @xmath56 . in figs.[fig : twots](a ) and ( b ) we show @xmath56 scans through the magnetic bragg reflections @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively , at both 2k and 110k .",

    "[ fig : twots](b ) is sharper at 110k compared with 2k and the amplitude of the peak slightly increases .",
    "figure [ fig : tvariationldep](a ) shows the temperature variation of the resolution corrected @xmath18 widths for several different magnetic bragg reflections . for the @xmath22",
    "even reflections , the widths of the peaks decrease very slightly on warming up to 70k , then between 70k and 120k the peaks sharpen dramatically before broadening as the temperature goes above 120k .",
    "the @xmath3 odd reflections decrease very slightly in width between 40k and 120k then broaden at higher temperatures . for comparison ,",
    "the sharpening of the @xmath3 even peaks between 10k and 120k is @xmath61% , whereas for the @xmath3 odd reflections it is only @xmath62% .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : tvariationldep](b ) we show the integrated intensities of the @xmath63 and @xmath64 magnetic bragg reflections as a function of temperature , obtained from the product of the gaussian and lorentzian widths in the @xmath65 and @xmath66 directions respectively , and the gaussian amplitude . between @xmath67k and @xmath68k the ratio of the integrated intensities of two reflections , which have @xmath3 odd and @xmath3 even respectively , is to a good approximation constant .",
    "this determines that the greater sharpening in the @xmath18 direction of the @xmath3 even reflections relative to the @xmath3 odd reflections is responsible for the different temperature dependences of the integrated intensities in scans parallel to @xmath65 shown in fig.[fig : hhdirection](b ) .",
    "the widths in the @xmath69 direction have not been included in the analysis , as the instrument resolution out of the scattering plane is large enough to integrate over all the intensity in the @xmath69 direction , irrespective any broadening .",
    "the central results of this study of stripe - ordered la@xmath0sr@xmath1nio@xmath35 are , ( i ) as magnetic order develops the magnetic bragg peaks broaden along the @xmath21-axis , and ( ii ) the temperature - dependent broadening of the @xmath3 even - integer reflections is 5 times greater ( 38% compared to 7% ) than that of the @xmath3 odd - integer reflections , see fig .",
    "[ fig : twots ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : tvariationldep](a ) .",
    "the reduction in out - of - plane correlation length on cooling is unrelated to the previously - observed spin re - orientation@xcite .",
    "it is believed that the ordering processes in lsno are driven by charge order , because charge ordering occurs at a higher temperature than spin ordering @xcite .",
    "previous studies show that on cooling the spin ",
    "charge stripe periodicity changes from that preferred by the charge order , to a periodicity that is a compromise between that preferred by the spin order and that preferred by the charge order @xcite@xcite . with reference to the new observations reported here",
    ", this suggests that in la@xmath0sr@xmath1nio@xmath35 the charge order favours long - range order along the @xmath21 axis whereas the combination of charge order and fully - developed magnetic order tends to disrupt the coupling between the layers , perhaps due to frustration effects .",
    "let us now consider why the @xmath3 even magnetic reflections broaden in the out - of - plane direction to a greater degree on cooling than do the @xmath22 odd reflections .",
    "the difference lies in the origin of these two reflections @xcite .",
    "the nature of the spin order in the out - of - plane direction is primarily controlled by minimization of coulomb repulsions between the charge stripes . for commensurate @xmath70 stripes , the stacking of the spin ",
    "charge order along the @xmath21 axis results in dominant @xmath3 odd magnetic bragg reflections @xcite .",
    "incommensurate stripe order , such as that at @xmath71 , can not adopt an ideal @xmath70 stacking and exhibits @xmath3 even magnetic reflections in addition to @xmath3 odd reflections .",
    "the fact that the @xmath72 even and @xmath72 odd peaks have different @xmath18 widths suggests the presence of more than one stacking sequence , with different sequences having different correlation lengths along the @xmath21 axis . upon cooling ,",
    "the development of magnetic order must introduce stacking faults along the @xmath21 axis in such a way that the majority @xmath70",
    "-type stacking is relatively unaffected while the minority stacking which has the largest influence on the @xmath72 even reflections becomes less well correlated .",
    "the cause of the smaller broadening of the @xmath72 even magnetic bragg reflections in the @xmath51 direction could be related to the large reduction of coherence in the magnetic order along the @xmath21 axis .",
    "our results are complementary to data recently reported by schlappa _",
    "et al . _ , who studied the charge and spin ordering in incommensurate stripe - ordered la@xmath73sr@xmath74nio@xmath8 by resonant x - ray scattering ( rxs ) techniques and neutron diffraction @xcite .",
    "the main focus of their study was on the temperature dependence of the intensity of the charge and magnetic bragg peaks measured by different diffraction probes , but they also found an increase in the widths of both the charge and magnetic bragg peaks with decreasing temperature .",
    "as pointed out by schlappa _",
    "et al . _ , care needs to be taken when comparing magnetic and charge bragg peaks measured by neutron and x - ray scattering since the x - ray measurement integrates over all the fluctuation spectrum in addition to the static component of the order .",
    "nevertheless , the similar temperature dependence of the widths of the magnetic reflections measured by rxs and the neutron diffraction in this study , suggests that the broadening of the charge peaks with decreasing temperature observed by x - rays is likely a property of the static order .",
    "this provides further evidence that the increased disorder in the @xmath21-axis stacking at low temperatures is a result of coupling between the magnetic and charge order .",
    "as mentioned earlier , charge order in the 1/8-doped cuprate la@xmath25ba@xmath5cuo@xmath6 tends to decouple the cu - o planes , leading to 2d superconductivity and quasi-2d magnetic ordering . in stripe - ordered la@xmath0sr@xmath1nio@xmath8 charge order couples the ni",
    " o planes favouring quasi-3d order . as magnetic order develops , however , charge and magnetic interactions along the @xmath21 axis compete and tend to reduce the out - of - plane correlation lengths , making the spin  charge ordering more 2d .",
    "therefore , lsno and the 1/8-doped cuprate behave in a qualitatively similar way as far as the inter - layer coupling of the magnetic order is concerned , but differ in that the charge order on adjacent layers in lsno is much more strongly coupled than it is in the cuprate .",
