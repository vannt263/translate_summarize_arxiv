    "harmonically driven potentials appear in many areas of modern physics , particularly in mesoscopic electronic semiconductor devices and other micro- and nano - structures driven by external voltages or applied laser fields .",
    "they also play a role for ultra - cold atomic wave packets exposed to optical barriers and photo - induced dynamics in strong laser fields or dissociation processes of molecules on solid surfaces .",
    "the strong external driving of the system typically leads to nonlinear quantum effects and chaos in the corresponding classical systems .",
    "two archetypical potentials have been investigated in detail in the literature , the driven potential well and the driven potential barrier .",
    "the periodic driving can be either a driving of the height or of the position of the potential . in the following",
    ", we will give a short overview of the known features of these systems .",
    "an early study of a vertically oscillating rectangular potential barrier , i.e. a potential with harmonically oscillating height , in @xcite aimed to derive an expression for the tunneling time through potential barriers .",
    "particles interacting with a driven potential barrier can absorb or emit quanta of @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the driving frequency .",
    "this leads to frequency - dependent resonances in the tunneling probability through the vertically oscillating barrier , as shown in @xcite for a rectangular barrier and a raised cosine potential .",
    "these resonances can , according to @xcite , be interpreted as poles of the scattering amplitudes in the complex plane . if the potential barrier is delta - shaped , it possesses a set of leaky bound states , which have been detected in @xcite by locating the complex energy poles of the transmission amplitude .",
    "these semi - bound states lead to additional resonances in the transmission function .",
    "other works analyzed the tunneling through a vertically driven gaussian - shaped barrier @xcite and through the `` eckart''-barrier @xcite .",
    "both found an amplification of tunneling for intermediate frequencies , but did not detect a resonant behavior , which is due to the parameters chosen in these works , according to @xcite .",
    "a vertically oscillating rectangular barrier , enclosed in a rigid potential box , has been studied in the classical regime , see refs .",
    "the phase space of this system is mixed , with a purely chaotic layer at low energies , kam - islands at intermediate energies and invariant spanning curves at high energies .",
    "the distribution of transversal times through the oscillating barrier is asymptotically algebraic with an exponent @xmath2 .",
    "the lyapunov exponent in the chaotic sea was also calculated for this system in @xcite as a function of the parameters .",
    "the lyapunov exponent changes abruptly whenever an invariant spanning curve , separating different parts of the chaotic sea , is destroyed .",
    "if the driving is stochastic instead of harmonic , the system has no invariant spanning curve for high energies and the particles exhibit normal fermi - acceleration ( @xcite ) .",
    "a laterally oscillating potential is often the result of a `` kramers - henneberger '' transformation of an ac - driven static potential . for high driving frequencies",
    "the tunneling probability through an ac - driven rectangular barrier shows resonances at small energies for which the static barrier would be entirely intransparent , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this can be described as resonant tunneling into quasi - stable bound states of the effective time - averaged potential , which has a double - barrier structure .",
    "for intermediate frequencies , the scattering process is dominated by inelastic processes and strong sidebands in the energy spectrum @xcite .",
    "such a resonant behavior was not found in the ac - driven gaussian - shaped barrier @xcite and the `` eckart''-barrier @xcite . instead , these two systems exhibit phase - sensitive tunneling resonances for intermediate frequencies , which can be explained by an increase in the relative kinetic energy of incoming particles when the barrier approaches them .",
    "a moving potential barrier can also be used to tailor wave packets or to split an initial pulse into several well - separated coherent pulses , see @xcite .",
    "potential wells with oscillating bottom have been studied in @xcite and @xcite . in the classical regime ,",
    "the oscillating square well is pseudo - integrable and therefore not a chaotic scatterer ( see also @xcite ) , whereas the oscillating smooth well has a stable kam - island in phase space which leads to chaotic scattering . in the quantum mechanical regime",
    "both the smooth and the rectangular oscillating well accommodate quasi - bound floquet states .",
    "multi - photon processes couple incoming particles to these states , leading to resonances , which are visible as dips in the transmission function and as peaks in the dwelltime .",
    "the tunneling through the laterally oscillating square well has resonances due to quasi - bound floquet states as well ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "however , due to the lateral driving these states belong to an effective double - well potential which leads to the formation of tunneling doublets . in the classical regime ,",
    "the ac - driven square well has a stable kam - island in phase space which leads to chaotic scattering .",
    "a signature of this kam - island is visible in representations of scattering wave functions in terms of wigner functions .",
    "the avoided crossings of the floquet quasi - energies of that system are studied in @xcite .",
    "sharp crossings of quasi - energies lead essentially only to a relabeling of the states , whereas broad crossings , in which more than two states take part , completely alter the floquet states and increase the high harmonic generation .    many other elementary systems have been studied as well : the so called tunneling diode , which consists of an oscillating quantum well between two static barriers , is investigated in @xcite and @xcite . in this system",
    "the driving creates additional sidebands due to the absorption or emission of oscillation quanta @xmath0 .",
    "the transmission through all sidebands exhibits a strong quenching at certain parameters .",
    "the classical phase space of an infinite array of vertically oscillating potential wells is mixed chaotic at small energies and has regular spanning curves at high energies , see @xcite .",
    "the motion of a particle in such a system resembles closely a random walk .",
    "driven double - wells have been studied in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the periodic driving can be used in these systems to entirely suppress the tunneling between the two wells , if the driving frequency is tuned to an exact crossing of the floquet energies of the ground state doublet of the unperturbed double - well .",
    "although several works deal with the tunneling through a laterally driven square potential , the classical dynamics in this system is largely unknown .",
    "the transmission of classical particles through a laterally driven gaussian - shaped potential has already been calculated in @xcite . however , this work does neither cover the whole range of possible parameters nor does it give any clue about the phase space structure , which is essential for the scattering process .",
    "the aim of this work is to close this gap and to provide a comprehensive survey of the periodically driven square barrier with oscillating position in the classical regime .",
    "we will analyze the entire phase space , where we find stable kam islands , understand the underlying dynamics and the chaotic scattering process .",
    "we will also explore the full range of possible system parameters and make comparisons with quantum mechanical results for the transmission probability .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in section [ sec_mapping ] we introduce the system of the driven barrier and derive a mapping to describe the dynamics . in section [ sec_phasespace ] we analyze the phase space where we find a stable island of quasi - periodic orbits . the position , size and parameter dependence of the stable island is studied in detail .",
    "the scattering dynamics , particularly the influence of the stable manifolds of the unstable periodic orbits , are the subject of section [ sec_scattering ] . due to the existence of the stable island ,",
    "the scattering dynamics is chaotic and trapping in the sticky region of phase space is possible although the barrier is purely repulsive",
    ". comparisons of the classical transmission probability with the quantum mechanical tunneling probability are made in subsection [ subsec_qm ] .",
    "finally , a summary is given in the last section [ sec_summary ] .",
    "our classical system consists of a one - dimensional laterally oscillating potential of a finite and constant height @xmath3 and width @xmath4 , see fig .",
    "[ fig_model ] .",
    "the driving function is assumed to be harmonic , with a driving amplitude @xmath5 and frequency @xmath1 @xmath6    although the dynamics of the system is continuous , the forces acting on the particle are point - like and the particles move ballistically between collisions with either of the edges of the barrier .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to describe the dynamics in terms of a discrete mapping between collisions . to describe the particle - barrier interaction ,",
    "we transform all coordinates into the frame of reference of the barrier , to the variables @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "even though this coordinate frame is accelerated and , therefore , not an inertial frame , momentum and energy are conserved for the infinitesimally small time span of the interaction .",
    "@xmath9 when colliding with the barrier from the _ outside _ a particle of mass @xmath10 is transmitted _ into _ the barrier if its kinetic energy , relative to the barrier , surpasses the barrier height @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath11 in this case the particle is decelerated due to energy conservation @xmath12 if it is not transmitted , it is reflected and its new velocity becomes @xmath13 likewise , if a particle hits the barrier coming from its _ inside _ , it is always transmitted and accelerated @xmath14 transforming these equations back to the laboratory frame yields the equations of motion @xmath15    for transmission and    @xmath16    if the particle is reflected , where @xmath17 is the barrier s velocity at the time of the collision @xmath18 and the sign @xmath19 depends on whether the particle is transmitted into the barrier ( @xmath20 ) or leaves the barrier ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the time @xmath22 is mapped on the time @xmath18 of the next collision of the particle with one of the barrier s edges . therefore @xmath18 is the smallest solution of @xmath23 where @xmath24 can be either edge of the barrier , @xmath25 or @xmath26 .",
    "if equation ( [ equ_coll ] ) has no solutions for @xmath27 then the particle does not collide with the barrier again and escapes . this implicit equation can be solved only numerically .",
    "it is important to make sure that the numerically calculated collision time is the _",
    "smallest _ solution of equation ( [ equ_coll ] ) , because many effects , like stickiness in phase space ( see sections [ sec_phasespace ] and [ sec_scattering ] ) , are susceptible to errors in the time mapping .",
    "the mapping shows that the five parameters of the system , the barrier s height @xmath28 and thickness @xmath4 , the driving frequency @xmath1 , the amplitude @xmath29 and the particle s mass @xmath10 , can be reduced to just two effective parameters by an appropriate scaling transformation .",
    "equations ( [ equ_vn+1_a ] ) and ( [ equ_vn+1_b ] ) then become : @xmath30 the only parameter left in the mapping is @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the maximum kinetic energy a particle , which is at rest in the laboratory frame , can have in the barrier s frame of reference .",
    "the second parameter , @xmath33 , is the barrier s thickness measured in units of the amplitude and appears in the implicit equation ( [ equ_coll ] ) for the time mapping . in the following ,",
    "we will scale the energy in units of @xmath34 and use the scaled coordinates in all calculations while keeping the same notation .",
    "the system is therefore completely described by the two parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we visualize the structures in phase space in terms of poincar surface of sections by mapping all collisions of the particle with either side of the barrier to the poincar section .",
    "this is equivalent to mapping all intersections of the trajectories in the 3-dimensional phase space with the two - dimensional manifold @xmath35 defined by the barrier s motion @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the position of either of the barrier s edges .",
    "since the driving function is assumed to be periodic , we can use the phase @xmath38 , defined as @xmath39 , instead of the time as a coordinate .",
    "the mapping naturally operates only on the manifold defined by @xmath35 , because it always maps a point in phase space on the point of the next collision with the barrier .",
    "the poincar section is made unique by mapping only intersections with one chosen edge of the barrier in a specified direction , i.e. @xmath40 or @xmath41 , instead of all collisions .",
    "thus the position and phase @xmath38 are uniquely connected by the driving function and one of the two coordinates becomes redundant . in the following , we will discuss poincar sections in which we plot the particle s velocity after a collision over the phase @xmath38 of the oscillating barrier .",
    "we covered the entire phase space with a fine grid of initial conditions to guarantee that all relevant structures are being shown in our poincar sections .",
    "the resulting poincar section is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig_poincare ] .",
    "the system s parameters are : @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "these parameters are typical for an experimental setup using semiconductor structures driven by external voltages or applied laser fields , @xcite .",
    "the phase space of the ac - driven barrier has four stable kam - islands whose center is a stable periodic orbit of period four .",
    "this means that , through the driving , the repulsive potential can trap particles in a small part of phase space .",
    "this kind of dynamical trapping works only for a harmonic driving law or other similarly curved functions .",

    "the thin transition zone at the edge of the island is mixed chaotic and contains a fractal structure of sub - islands .",
    "the space outside the stable orbits contains only few points because this part of phase space is visited only by trajectories which leave the open system after a few collisions , whereas those on regular orbits stay in the scattering region ( defined as the space that is covered by the barrier s oscillation ) indefinitely . the poincar section in fig .",
    "[ fig_poincare ] is _ not _ unique because it shows all collisions , with both edges of the barrier and in both directions .",
    "structure 1 and 4 correspond to collisions with the left edge , structure 2 and 3 correspond to collisions with the right edge .",
    "the four regular islands are symmetrical , the first and second structures are identical to the third and fourth with their phases increased by @xmath44 and the sign of their velocity inverted .",
    "this reflects the symmetric properties of the driving function @xmath45 : @xmath46 and @xmath47    the trajectory of the central periodic orbit of the stable island , plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig_xt - fixpoint ] , is as following : starting left of the barrier at ( 4 ) with a velocity of zero , the particle is hit by the barrier at ( 1 ) . due to the relatively high negative velocity of the barrier at @xmath48 ,",
    "the particle is transmitted into the barrier and accelerated in negative direction .",
    "this creates the stable fixed point of the island 1 in fig .",
    "[ fig_poincare ] and the corresponding stable island 1 if we vary the initial conditions in the neighborhood of the fixed point .",
    "the barrier then overtakes the particle inside of it and the particle collides with the right edge of the barrier at ( 2 ) .",
    "since the velocity of the barrier at the points ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) is identical ( @xmath49 ) , the velocity of the particle becomes zero again .",
    "this collision corresponds to island 2 in fig .",
    "[ fig_poincare ] .",
    "after the barrier has reached its minimum position and turning point at @xmath50 , it moves back in positive direction and hits the particle at ( 3 ) .",
    "this collision accelerates the particle in positive direction and the particle moves with the barrier until it is overtaken by it at ( 4 ) , where the velocity of the particle becomes zero again and the periodic cycle starts again . due to the symmetry of the driving function ( @xmath51 ) , the collisions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are symmetrical to ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) .    the trajectories of the quasi - periodic orbits can be understood as a perturbation of the periodic orbit described above .",
    "a typical trajectory of such an orbit is plotted in fig .",
    "[ plot_xt - trapped - example ] and shows both modes of the motion : the periodic hopping between the four islands inherited form the stable periodic orbit and an overlaid harmonic oscillation .",
    "this sinusoidal motion is represented as closed orbit in the poincar section .",
    "the frequency of this harmonic oscillation , measured by a fourier transformation , is equal to the frequency by which the particles rotate on the quasi - periodic orbit around the elliptic fixed points in the poincar section .",
    "it is possible to calculate the position of the central elliptic fixed points , here we will do it for island number 1 . as fig .",
    "[ fig_xt - fixpoint ] shows , the velocity of the periodic orbit is zero while the particle is outside of the barrier in structure 2 and 4 ( @xmath52 ) . due to the symmetry of the system , the collision points are symmetric around @xmath53 in their phases @xmath48 and @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) and around the equilibrium position in their positions @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",

    "since all stable orbits cross the @xmath77 axis , this would destroy all of them . for @xmath78 , @xmath79 in equation ( [ equ_fix_v1 ] ) would have to be positive , which is physically impossible ( see discussion of the periodic orbit , fig .",
    "[ fig_xt - fixpoint ] ) .",
    "the phases of the other fixed points can be calculated from the phase and position position of the fixed point of island 1 by using the symmetry properties of the driving function : @xmath80    the shape and size of the stable islands in the poincar sections change with varying parameters .",
    "[ fig_poincare_zoom ] is typical for the phase space of this system : the central fixed point and the island of quasi - periodic orbits are surrounded by a chaotic layer with a fractal structure of stable and unstable periodic orbits .",
    "additionally , there exist one or more sets of large and distinguished sub - islands",

    "islands with an even period appear as pairs , therefore the sequence of the number of large sub - islands is @xmath83 , see fig .",
    "[ fig_poincare_multi ] .",
    "the sequence starts at the maximal value of @xmath3 that allows for bound orbits as plotted in fig .",

    "the creation and destruction of the sub - islands follows the same sequence for all @xmath4 as @xmath3 is varied , albeit on a different scale .",
    "a variation of the barrier width @xmath4 at a constant @xmath3 leads to the same sequence as well .",
    "this suggests that the qualitative behavior of the phase space structure can be described by just one effective nonlinearity parameter , consisting of a combination of @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "this sequence of sub - islands is typical for nonlinear systems and has been studied in detail in the standard map , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the creation and destruction of stable periodic orbits , or rather quasi - periodic orbits in general , is tied closely to number theory .",
    "the kam tori can be characterized by their winding number .",
    "it was conjectured @xcite that the last kam tori to be destroyed when the nonlinearity is increased are those with rotation numbers equal to noble numbers , which can be written as continued fractions .",
    "before such a torus with rotation number @xmath86 is destroyed , all the periodic orbits with rotation number equal to a truncation of the noble number @xmath86 become unstable .",
    "thus , the winding numbers of the large sub - islands can be interpreted as the truncations of the simplest first - order noble numbers .",
    "these sub - islands also play a significant role in the scattering process .",
    "as we will demonstrate , the flow into and out of the border zone of the stable island is dominated by the stable and unstable manifolds of the outermost large sub - islands , even for parameters for which the island has entirely dissolved .    the area covered by the elliptic island changes with the parameters as well .",
    "we analyzed numerically the surface covered by the stable island as a function of the parameters by dividing the phase space of the poincar sections into a fine grid of @xmath87 small squares .",
    "all squares containing data points of the stable islands count as part of the surface .",
    "we checked this method for its stability by doubling the number of data points and comparing the resulting surfaces .",

    "[ fig_volume ] as a function of the barrier s height @xmath3 for different values of the barrier s width @xmath4 .",
    "the peaks of the area in fig .",
    "[ fig_volume ] are well understood : the size of the stable island is defined by two competing effects . as the potential hight @xmath3",
    "is decreased , the quasi - periodic orbits move outwards , which increases the island s size . at the same time , outer quasi - periodic orbits are destroyed .",
    "since tori with noble rotation number are destroyed very late , the covered surface reaches a maximum whenever the outermost torus has a noble rotation number . at this point , other tori inside this noble torus",
    "have already been destroyed and the outermost curve separates a chaotic sea inside of the island from the outer chaotic area .",
    "when this outermost noble torus is destroyed , the two chaotic parts become connected and the size of the island reaches a sharp minimum .",
    "this kind of behavior is typical for nonlinear systems , see @xcite .    to gain further insight into the properties of the transition zone around the stable island , we use a method developed in @xcite and @xcite to locate the unstable periodic orbits ( upo ) of this system . given a n - dimensional discrete chaotic dynamical system @xmath88 defined by @xmath89 a linear transformation is used to construct a new system @xmath90 defined as @xmath91 where the matrix @xmath92 is orthogonal , @xmath93 is a small factor and @xmath94 is the period of the fixed point we want to stabilize .",
    "evidently , @xmath90 and @xmath95 have the same fixed points .",
    "it can be shown that for every unstable fixed point there exists a suitable orthogonal transformation matrix @xmath92 and a small factor @xmath93 such that this unstable fixed point is stable under @xmath90 .",
    "the factor @xmath93 has to be small enough so that the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath96 have absolute values smaller than 1 , where @xmath97 is the stability matrix of the system @xmath88 .",
    "the matrices @xmath92 correspond to reflections and rotations along the coordinate axes , thus all entries of @xmath92 are @xmath98 and each row and column contains only one element which is different form zero .",
    "there exists a total number of @xmath99 of such matrices that will , in general , stabilize different types of unstable periodic orbits .",
    "however , it can be shown that a much smaller number of @xmath92 is sufficient to find all periodic orbits because some of the linear transformations are redundant .",
    "only three matrices are needed in a two - dimensional system , see @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this method over more conventional approaches , such as newton - raphson , is the global convergence .",
    "even initial conditions far away from a fixed point eventually converge if the matrix @xmath92 and the factor @xmath93 are chosen appropriately .    in the system of the driven barrier we search for periodic orbits in the unique poincar sections such as fig .",

    "a typical result is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig_upo ] which shows the unstable periodic points as black crosses , the stable periodic orbits as black dots and the corresponding poincar section in gray .",
    "the stability was derived according to the eigenvalues of the monodromy matrix .",
    "the chaotic layer around the elliptic island contains many families of periodic orbits which form the skeleton of the fractal structure .",
    "the number of unstable fixed points rises exponentially with their period .",
    "the unstable periodic orbits , or rather their stable manifolds , play an important role for the scattering process .",
    "this is because , although the stable island is itself not directly accessible by initial conditions starting outside of the interaction area , the stable manifolds , also called stable asymptotic curves , reach far into the part of phase space which is accessible from the outside . in order to calculate the flow of an unstable periodic orbit we take a small initial segment of length @xmath105 along the eigenvectors of the monodromy matrix at the upo and",
    "iterate an ensemble of @xmath87 initial conditions in this segment forward in time along the unstable asymptotic curves or backward in time along the stable asymptotic curves .",
    "it is in this system not possible to follow the manifolds of a specific upo , because the manifolds of different upos cross each other at heteroclinic intersections .",
    "thus the flow becomes chaotic and our simulations produce a global picture of the flow of the system of upos .",
    "the stable and unstable manifolds , plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig_flowstable ] and fig .  [ fig_flowunstable ] , reach far out of the border region into the chaotic sea in what looks in these plots as spiral arms , which consist of an infinite number of stable or unstable curves .",
    "these outer manifolds belong to periodic orbits with a period of 3 or multiples of 3 .",
    "we calculated the asymptotic curves of the system for the whole range of parameters and found that they are closely tied to the large primary sub - islands around the island . the flow into and out of the stable island is always dominated by the outermost family of sub - islands , even if this family is completely unstable .",
    "therefore the number of spiral arms which are formed by the manifolds follows the same sequence as the sub - islands when the parameters are changed .",
    "the unstable periodic orbits and with them their asymptotic curves are present only for parameters which allow for the existence of the stable island in phase space , see fig .",

    "it makes sense to use the initial velocity @xmath106 and the phase of the first collision @xmath48 as parameters of the scattering because this allows an easy comparison to the poincar sections of section [ sec_phasespace ] , where we use similar coordinates .",
