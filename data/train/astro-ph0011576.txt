    "over the past two decades , studies of galaxies have become increasingly more quantitative as powerful new instruments sensitive from the far - ultraviolet ( uv ) to the infrared ( ir ) have become available . with these observations ,",
    "it has become clear that the presence of dust has a significant effect on the observed properties of galaxies ; the observed spectral energy distribution ( sed ) is a complex convolution of the intrinsic sed of the stellar populations with the physical properties of the absorbing and scattering medium ( dust ) , including its composition as well as its geometric relation to the stellar sources .",
    "in addition to complicating the interpretation of observations of galaxies , dust is also an essential component in determining and modifying the physical conditions in the interstellar medium ( ism ) of galaxies , regulating star formation , and participating in the chemical evolution of the galaxy .",
    "the effects of dust are particularly pronounced in galaxies undergoing active star formation , e.g. , starburst galaxies .",
    "a substantial fraction of nearby galaxies ( @xmath030% ; salzer et al .",
    "1995 ) is made up of active star forming galaxies and nearly all galaxies at high redshift display characteristics typical of local star forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "therefore , the ability to quantify the effects of dust in interpreting galaxy observations has implications not only for the study of starburst galaxies themselves , but also the formation and evolution of galaxies over the age of the universe .",
    "quantifying the effects of dust in any astrophysical system is complicated by the geometric relationship between the illumination source(s ) and the dust , uncertainty in the dust composition , and the structure of the scattering and absorbing medium .",
    "these effects are especially pronounced in galaxies , where a typical observing aperture may include multiple , complex regions comprised of stars , gas , and dust mixed together in complicated geometries and widely varying environments .",
    "differences in stellar populations , metallicities , dust properties , and geometry can produce similar effects on observed properties of galaxies .",
    "disentangling the effects of these various intrinsic galactic properties requires the use of realistic models of the transfer of radiation including both stars and dust .",
    "historically , the treatment of dust in radiative transfer simulations has been necessarily simplistic . in many cases ,",
    "the dust distribution is assumed to take the form of a foreground screen in analogy with stellar extinction studies . however , the extension of this simple geometry to more complicated systems like galaxies can lead to severely erroneous results regarding the amount of dust present and its effects on the observed sed ( e.g. , witt , thronson & capuano 1992 and references therein ) .",
    "observationally , the interstellar medium in the milky way and external galaxies possesses structure over a range of spatial scales , characterized by variations in density over several orders of magnitude .",
    "finally , the physical characteristics of the dust grains determine how the grains absorb , scatter , and re - emit stellar photons .",
    "many models of the transfer of radiation through dusty media in galaxies have appeared in the literature and although they have included all of these factors to some degree , owing to the complexity of the problem , none treat them all simultaneously . some are restricted to geometries that exhibit global symmetries @xcite , while others assume constant or continuously varying , homogeneous dust distributions @xcite or do not fully treat the re - emission from grains in the infrared @xcite .",
    "one of the seminal works in establishing the importance of geometry in radiative transfer models of galaxies is that of @xcite .",
    "subsequent work established the importance of local structure , i.e. clumpiness , in modeling the transport of radiation in dusty media @xcite .",
    "the models developed by these authors employ monte carlo techniques to solve the radiative transfer equations through inhomogeneous dusty media with arbitrary geometries .",
    "the models are quite general , including the effects of multiple scattering and non  isotropic scattering functions .",
    "the use of monte carlo techniques in the radiative transfer problem allows the treatment of arbitrary 3-dimensional geometries with no symmetries and can easily include a non  homogeneous , clumpy structure for the scattering and absorbing medium .",
    "however , the models do not include the effects of dust heating and re - emission . in this paper and a companion paper @xcite",
    ", we present the dirtymodel which incorporates the strengths of the previous models and extends them to include dust heating and re  emission in the ir . the importance of the ir in understanding galaxies can be readily seen by considering the absorption , scattering , and emission properties of dust .",
    "the absorption , scattering , and re - emission of photons by dust grains occur in different wavelength regimes .",
    "dust is very efficient at absorbing and scattering uv / optical photons .",
    "the energy absorbed by the dust is thermalized and re  emitted at ir wavelengths . as a result , a large fraction ( approaching 100% for heavily enshrouded regions ) of a galaxy s uv / optical energy may be reprocessed and re  emitted by the dust at ir wavelengths .",
    "thus studies of galaxies that consider only the uv / optical wavelengths can neglect a large fraction of the galaxies energy budgets . a successful model of the transfer and emission of radiation in a galaxy must consistently reproduce the observed sed of the galaxy from the uv to the far infrared ( fir ) simultaneously .",
    "reprocessing of uv / optical photons into ir photons occurs through two basic mechanisms depending both on the radiation field they are exposed to and the radius , @xmath1 , of the dust grain .",
    "large dust grains reach thermal equilibrium and emit as modified blackbodies with an equilibrium temperature , @xmath2",
    ". however , small grains ( and also large molecules e.g. , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or pah ) have small heat capacities and the absorption of even a single uv / optical photon can substantially heat the grain .",
    "these small grains will not reach an equilibrium temperature but will instead undergo temperature fluctuations that lead to grain emission at temperatures well in excess of @xmath2 .",
    "the inclusion of small , thermally fluctuating grains in dust models is necessary to explain the excess of near and mid - ir emission observed in a variety of systems , including galaxies ( e.g. , sellgren 1984 ; helou 1986 ; boulanger & prault 1988 ; sauvage , thuan & vigroux 1990 ) .",
    "in addition , the observation of prominent emission lines widely ascribed to pah molecules in the spectra of galaxies ( e.g. , acosta - pulido et al .",
    "1996 ) , indicates that a realistic dust model should include such a component .",
    "while many authors have elucidated methods of calculating the emission from small , thermally fluctuating grains ( e.g. draine & andersen 1985 ; dwek 1986 ; leger , dhendecourt & dfourneau 1989 ; guhathakurta & draine 1989 ) , their inclusion in radiative transfer calculations has been limited .",
    "our extension of the dirtymodel includes large grains , small grains ( @xmath3    and @xmath4   , respectively ; see  [ sec : trans ] ) , and pah molecules and we treat the heating and re - emission by each component in the appropriate regime .",
    "in this paper , we present our model , concentrating on the dust heating and emission .",
    "details of the monte carlo calculations are presented in a companion paper @xcite . in ",
    "[ sec : dust_model ] , we discuss the details of our dust grain model ; we review the relevant equations for determining the dust emission spectrum , describe our computational method , and discuss the details of the computation in  [ sec : physics ] ; results of the model calculations are presented in  [ sec : application ] in the context of applications of dirtyto starburst galaxies , including a discussion of the response of the model sed to variations in the input parameters , e.g. , the dust grain model , global and local geometries , heating sources ( age , star formation rate [ sfr ] ) , size , and optical depth ; we conclude with a summary and outline some future directions in  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in order to calculate the absorption and re  emission characteristics of a population of dust grains , we must specify their composition , optical properties , and size distribution .",
    "our dust grain model consists of a mixture of carbonaceous ( amorphous and graphitic carbon ) and silicate grains as well as pah molecules .",
    "although the exact composition of interstellar dust is still a matter of debate and certainly varies in different environments , we include these components in order to match several well observed extinction and emission features in the interstellar medium of the milky way and other galaxies .",
    "the presence of silicate grains is inferred from prominent stretching and bending mode features at @xmath5 and @xmath6 in the mid  infrared .",
    "these features are observed in h  ii regions , near young as well as evolved stars , and in the integrated spectra of external galaxies @xcite",
    ". the well known 2175     absorption feature , which is normally attributed to the presence of small carbonaceous grains in the form of graphite ( other possibilities for the carrier exist .",
    "see e.g. draine [ 1989 ] , duley & seahra [ 1999 ] ) , has been observed along lines of sight in our own galaxy as well the magellanic clouds ( gordon & clayton 1998 ; misselt , clayton & gordon 1999 ) and m  31 @xcite . the presence of narrow emission features in the mid  infrared implies a third dust component .",
    "these features are associated with c  c ( 6.2 and 7.7  ) and c  h ( 3.3 , 8.6 , and 11.3  ) bending and stretching modes in aromatic molecular structures ( lger & dhendecourt 1988 ; allamandola , tielens & barker 1989 ) , and the source of these aromatic emission features is widely identified with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules , though other assignments have been made @xcite .",
    "the mid  infrared emission features have been observed in a wide variety of astrophysical environments including external galaxies and so we include a pah component in our model .    with the grain composition established for our modeling purposes ,",
    "we need to specify the absorption , scattering , and extinction cross sections , @xmath7 of the grains as well as the their size distribution and abundances . for spherical grains ,",
    "@xmath8 is specified in terms of the efficiencies , @xmath9 ;    @xmath10    where @xmath1 is the radius of the grain .",
    "the optical scattering and absorption efficiencies of the graphite , amorphous carbon ( amc ) , and silicate grain populations were derived from mie theory @xcite with the dielectric functions described in @xcite ( graphite ) , @xcite ( amc ) , and @xcite ( silicate ) .",
    "the cross ",
    "sections for the pah molecules were derived from the analytic form presented in @xcite .",
    "this analytic form is in turn based on the work of @xcite and dsert , boulanger & puget ( 1990 ) who decompose the pah cross ",
    "section into three parts ; uv - visual continuum , ir continuum , and ir lines .",
    "the pah cross ",
    "section is based both on laboratory data ( uv  visual ; ir line integrated cross sections ) and observations of the reflection nebula ngc  2023 ( ir line widths and continuum ) .",
    "these pah cross ",
    "sections do not include a 2175    bump , whereas many laboratory data suggest that pah molecules do have absorption features in the uv , though they have difficulty reproducing the observed stability of the central wavelength of the bump . in light of the uncertainty in constructing dust grain models",
    ", we do not consider this a serious problem ; as greater understanding of dust grain behavior becomes available ( including , for example , accounting for the non - bulk nature of the optical properties of nano - sized grains and molecules ) , our input dust model can be easily extended to include these sorts of refinements . since the origin of some of the pah emission line features is in c ",
    "c modes and others in c  h modes , their relative strengths can be adjusted by allowing the hydrogen coverage @xmath11 to vary @xcite . as our purpose here",
    "is not the detailed fitting of individual objects nor the prediction of the strengths of individual aromatic features , we set @xmath12 and do not investigate the effects of varying it further .",
    "mathis , rumpl & nordseick ( 1977 , mrn ) showed that the near ir to far uv extinction curve could be reproduced by a simple two component ( graphite + silicates ) dust model with a power law size distribution , @xmath13 .",
    "the original mrn model included grain sizes from @xmath14    to @xmath15 .",
    "the large lower limit on the size of the grains in the mrn model is a serious limitation .",
    "the grains are large enough that they almost always maintain equilibrium temperatures which are too low to explain the observed emission shortward of @xmath16 in the milky way and other galaxies .",
    "modeling the near to mid - ir emission requires the inclusion of a population of small grains that undergo temperature fluctuations and hence spend some fraction of the time emitting at temperatures in substantial excess of their equilibrium temperature ( see  [ sec : trans ] ) . in our model , the graphite , amc , and silicate grains have radii that extend from @xmath17  to @xmath18 .",
    "since the grain optical constants used to derive the scattering , emission , and absorption efficiencies of the grains do not vary depending on the extinction curve , reproducing the observed extinction curve features in the different environments requires that we vary the size distributions and relative abundances of the different grain species .",
    "we derive the size distributions , @xmath19 ( grains @xmath20 h@xmath21 ) , of the graphite , amc , and silicate grains from fits to the observed extinction curves in various environments , including the milky way , and the large and small magellanic clouds ( mw , lmc , & smc ) . we have constructed two dust models for each extinction curve , one consisting of a population of graphite and silicate grains ( a ) and the other of graphite , amc , and silicate grains ( b ) .",
    "the observed extinction curves are fit using the maximum entropy method which seeks to find the smoothest size distributions consistent with the observations @xcite . the size distributions and relative abundances of the grain components",
    "are adjusted to best fit the overall shape of the observed extinction curves .",
    "for example , since our grain model identifies the carriers of the 2175    feature as small graphite grains , the presence of the 2175    feature in the milky way extinction curve requires a large population of these carriers .",
    "the population of small graphite grains in the smc will be reduced with respect to the mw to reproduce the observed absence of the 2175     extinction feature . on the other hand ,",
    "the paucity of small graphitic grains in our smc dust models requires a large population of small silicate grains in order to reproduce the steep far uv rise in the smc extinction curve .",
    "small silicate grains will be even more important in the three component ( silicate , amc , and graphite ) dust model for the smc since essentially all the carbon is amorphous in our dust model and does not contribute to the far uv rise .",
    "the observed extinction curves were taken from the literature : the mw curve is taken to be the average mw curve as parameterized by cardelli , clayton & mathis ( 1989 ) with @xmath22 .",
    "we fit two average lmc extinction curves , one derived from observations near the superbubble lmc  2 and the other from observations in the rest of the lmc @xcite .",
    "the smc extinction curve is taken from @xcite .",
    "models a and b are both extended to include a pah component .",
    "the pah component is included as an extension of the carbonaceous component grain size distribution to a minimum size of 4    ( @xmath23 carbon atoms ; @xmath24   ) . at the upper end of the pah size distribution , we require that the number of carbon atoms in the largest pah molecule equal the number of carbon atoms in the smallest carbonaceous grain .",
    "for example , a spherical graphite grain of radius 8.5    contains @xmath25 carbon atoms , which we take as the number of carbon atoms in the largest pah molecule , corresponding to a maximum pah size of @xmath26   .",
    "the pah are tied to the graphite grain size distribution and the amc grain size distribution for models a and b , respectively . although the exact shape of the size distribution of small grains and molecules is not well known and not well constrained by extinction curve fitting , a substantial population is required , both to reproduced the observed extinction as well as the mid ir emission from dust ; for the pah size distribution , we assume a log - normal form given by    @xmath27 ^ 2 } \\label{eq : pah_dnda}\\ ] ]    ( weingartner & draine 2000 ) where @xmath28 is a normalization which we derive by requiring that the graphite and pah size distributions merge smoothly at @xmath29 , i.e. ,    @xmath30 \\right| _ { n_c = 300}. \\label{eq : pah_norm}\\ ] ]    after including the pah component , the size distributions of the carbonaceous grains are normalized to insure conservation of the total mass of carbon in the dust model . in table",

    "the model extinction curves have been decomposed into the contributions from the three grain components .",
    "a grain model that is able to fit the observed extinction curves should also provide an acceptable fit to the observed emission .",
    "we have calculated the emission expected from our dust model when exposed to the local radiation field as a check on the model .",

    "our mw grain model reproduces the diffuse interstellar ir emission reasonably well from @xmath31 though it overestimates by roughly a factor of two the emission in the 60 , 100 , and 140  bands .",

    "in this section we describe the derivation of the dust emission spectrum given a dust grain model and heating sources .",

    "we outline the relevant equations for both equilibrium and single ",
    "photon , or transient , heating of dust grains .",
    "the actual implementation of our heating code is discussed in  [ sec : comp_method ] .      the monochromatic energy absorbed by a spherical dust grain of radius @xmath1 and species @xmath62 exposed to a radiation field @xmath63",

    "the energy emitted by the same particle can be expressed by    @xmath66    where @xmath67 is the planck function evaluated at the temperature of the grain .",

    "the dust emission spectrum from all species and grain sizes is calculated in a straightforward manner :    @xmath69      the main assumption in the above discussion is that the dust grains reach equilibrium with the radiation field and can be characterized by a single temperature . while this assumption is valid for large grains , it is not generally true for small grains .",
    "the absorption of a single high energy photon by a small grain can raise its temperature significantly above its equilibrium temperature .",
    "which grains fall into the `` large '' and `` small '' categories depends on the grain composition as well as the characteristics of the radiation field , for computational purposes the division can be roughly made at @xmath70   .",
    "for example , a 100    graphite grain at a temperature of 25  k which absorbs a lyman limit photon ( @xmath71   ) is heated to @xmath72  k , while a 40    grain will reach a temperature of @xmath73  k , with the temperature change becoming progressively larger for smaller and smaller grains .",
    "this temperature represents the maximum temperature the grain can reach .",
    "so while grains of all sizes will have time dependent temperatures characterized by a probability distribution , @xmath74 , rather than a single temperature , @xmath74 will be narrowly distributed about the equilibrium temperature for large grains but small grains will have very broad temperature probability distributions . in this case , the planck function in eq .",

    "a subtle difference is seen in the depth of the @xmath182 absorption feature , which is deeper in the smc sed compared to the mw curve . since the @xmath183 feature is attributed to stretching and bending resonances in the small silicate grains @xcite , its strength in the smc sed",
    "is not surprising given that a large number of small silicate grains are required in the smc dust model to reproduce the steep linear rise in the far uv extinction curve .",

    "the effect of increased emission in the mid ir on , for example , iras colors , is to increase the f@xmath184/f@xmath185 and f@xmath185/f@xmath186 flux ratios . as we are illustrating the behavior of the dirtymodel in the context of a starburst galaxy model in this paper , in figures [ fig : cc_plots]a  c , we plot the iras colors of starburst galaxies with measured fluxes in all four iras bands from the sample of @xcite , along with tracks from runs of the dirtymodel .",

    "the first thing to notice is that the model results cover essentially the full range of observed starburst colors .",
    "however , in detail , the model colors show some discrepancies compared to observations , as is especially evident in figures [ fig : cc_plots]b & c. the discrepancy between the model colors and the starburst data is attributable to low mid ir fluxes predicted by the former , especially at 25  .",
    "the low predicted mid ir fluxes can be traced directly to the dust model .",
    "as can be seen in figures [ fig : cc_plots]b & c , the discrepancy between dirtycolors and the data is lessened when the mw dust model is used .",
    "this results from the inclusion of more small graphite grains and pah molecules in the mw dust model (  [ sec : dust_model ] ) , which increases the contribution of transient heating to the mid ir emission ( see  [ sec : dis_trans ] and figures [ fig : tr_onoff ] & [ fig : sed_mwsmc_comp ] ) .",
    "while it is not our intention with this paper to explore in detail the wide range of systems to which the dirtymodel can be applied , including starbursts , these figures are indicative of the diagnostic potential of properly done , self  consistent uv to far ir radiative transfer simulations .",
    "the apparent deficit of small grains could be alleviated by including a separate , large population of small graphitic grains in the dust model .",
    "however , the absence of a significant 2175    absorption feature in the uv seds of many starburst galaxies @xcite makes such a modification of the grain model problematic as the small graphite grains are responsible for this feature in our dust model .",
    "hence , self  consistently reproducing the seds of starburst galaxies over a wide wavelength regime may require more complicated grain models , such as a four component model including amorphous carbonaceous grains in addition to the pah , graphite and silicates ( i.e. , dust grain model b ) .",
    "indeed , using our dust grain model b with a size distribution appropriate for the smc brings the colors of the predicted sed into better agreement with the observed colors ( see figure [ fig : sed_mwsmc_comp](b ) ) .",
    "such a diagnostic of grain materials may provide insight into grain processing histories and grain evolution in response to a wide range of environmental factors ( e.g. gordon & clayton , 1998 ; misselt et al .",

    "figure [ fig : sed_var_tv_cgg ] contrasts the behavior of the shell and dusty geometries at the same optical depth .",
    "we plot the model seds for both geometries for two extreme optical depths , @xmath188 and @xmath189 with all other input parameters set to the values in column 4 of table [ tbl : model_param ] . at a given @xmath167 , the shell geometry absorbs more energy than the dusty geometry since in the shell configuration",
    "the stars lie inside all the dust while in the dusty configuration the stars are mixed throughout the dust so energy from stars in the outer parts of the model has a greater chance of escaping the model space without being absorbed @xcite . as a result , at a given optical depth",

    "in addition , owing to the temperature structure , the shell geometry produces a broader ir sed .",
    "while the dust near the centrally distributed heating sources reaches higher temperatures in the shell geometry , dust in the outlying regions sees fewer high energy photons and subsequently is heated to lower temperatures .",
    "since heating sources are distributed throughout the model with the dusty geometry , the resulting temperature distribution is much flatter than in the shell case ( see fig [ fig : temp_var_tv_cgg]a , b ) , resulting in a narrower ir sed .",
    "for a given physical model size , specifying the input optical depth , @xmath167 , is equivalent to specifying the dust mass .",

    "figures [ fig : sed_var_tv]a & [ fig : sed_var_tv]b show a series of model calculations with increasing @xmath167 for shell and dusty geometries , respectively . in both cases , as @xmath167 increases , the ir sed broadens and the peak of the ir emission shifts to longer wavelengths .",
    "the shift to longer wavelengths , corresponding to lower dust temperatures , is a result of higher dust masses with increasing @xmath167 .",
    "so even though more of the input energy is absorbed as @xmath167 increases , there is more dust to heat and the dust is consequently cooler .",
    "the ir sed broadens as a result of the increasing importance of the lower density medium in absorbing the input energy . for a constant @xmath102 and @xmath168 , as @xmath167 increases , the fraction of energy absorbed in the low density medium increases .",
    "since the low density medium reaches higher temperatures than the dense clumps , there is a wider range of dust temperatures for high @xmath167 as compared to the low @xmath167 models where most of the energy is absorbed in the dense clumps ( see figure [ fig : temp_var_tvc ] ) . in addition , at high @xmath167 , the opacity of the dust is still significant even at mid ir wavelengths and some of the energy emitted by the dust is re - absorbed and emitted at longer wavelengths , further broadening the ir sed .",
    "along with @xmath167 , the physical size of the modeled region will determine the total dust mass of the system and hence affect the predicted ir spectrum from the dust emission .",
    "there is no dependence in the optical to uv spectrum on the system size since the radiative transfer ( and hence total energy absorbed at any point in the model ) depends only on the total optical depth through a given model bin . on the other hand ,",
    "the dust mass in a given model bin depends not only on the optical depth , but also the physical size of the bin ; the larger the bin , the higher the dust mass ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : dust_mass ] ) . as the temperature",
    "an individual dust grain will reach depends on the ratio of the energy absorbed to the total dust mass , increasing the size of the model ( and hence the size and dust mass of the individual model bins ) results in a decrease in the temperature of individual grains .",
    "therefore , we expect the peak of the infrared emission to shift to longer wavelengths as we increase the size of the model .",
    "we see exactly this dependence in figures [ fig : var_size_sh]a , b where we plot the predicted sed for a range of model radii from 100  pc to 5000  pc for both ( a ) smc and ( b ) mw type dust models .",
    "the peak of the ir dust spectrum shifts from @xmath190  to @xmath0200  over the range of sizes considered . of particular importance is the fact that , although the peak shifts to longer wavelengths , the spectrum is not what would be observed by simply shifting the smaller radius model sed to longer wavelengths .",
    "the larger models still exhibit substantial ir emission at shorter wavelengths from @xmath010  to @xmath050  , illustrating the importance of the inclusion of small , transiently heated grains in the model .",
    "the transient heating of the small grains does not depend on the total energy absorbed . while the equilibrium heating of the dust results in lower dust temperatures , the temperature excursions experienced by the small grains (  [ sec : trans ] ) result in a contribution to ir sed at shorter wavelengths , characteristic of hotter dust grains .",
    "the same behavior is seen for both dust type models with the only difference being the higher mid  ir emission from the mw type dust resulting from a larger contribution from small graphite grains to the sed (  [ sec : dis_dust ] ) .",
    "the input parameters that determine the dust mass in a given model are the physical size , @xmath167 , the dust grain model ( mw , lmc , smc ) , and the global geometry .",
    "the clumpiness of the local dust distribution leads to statistical fluctuations in the total mass , but on average the mass of models with different @xmath102 and @xmath168 remains the same @xcite .",
    "the remaining input parameters pertain to the input stellar population and do not affect the dust mass . in figure [ fig : dust_mass ] , we plot the dependence of the total model dust mass on ( a ) @xmath167 and ( b ) physical size for the shell and dusty geometries .",
    "the application of the dirtymodel to starburst galaxies requires the specification of the stellar content of the galaxy along with its star formation history . in general ,",
    "the star formation history can be characterized by either a burst scenario , wherein all the stars form at once and subsequently evolve , or by a constant star formation scenario , wherein stars form continuously as the starburst ages . while the situation in real starburst galaxies is likely somewhere in between , for the purpose of illustrating the dirtymodel",
    ", we consider only the constant star formation scenario . for this scenario ,",
    "an increase in either age or star formation rates will lead to an increase in the total mass of the starburst .",
    "increasing the age of the starburst while keeping the sfr constant , while increasing the total stellar mass , results in an increase of the importance of the contribution of older , less luminous stars to the sed relative to the hot , young stars which dominate the uv .",
    "as the starburst ages , the massive young stars are continuously replenished and their contribution to the uv sed approaches a constant as an equilibrium is reached between their formation and evolution .",
    "hence , increasing the mass of the starburst by increasing its age results in a higher and higher fraction of its energy being produced in the optical and nir wavelength regime .",
    "the result is a change in the shape of the input sed as the starburst ages , the uv approaching a constant with the optical and nir increasing in importance ; see figure [ fig : in_sed_comp ] . on the other hand , increasing the mass of the starburst by increasing the sfr at a constant age has the effect of simply scaling up the input sed . at a given age ,",
    "increasing the sfr results in an increase in the number of old _ and _ young stars and the total emitted energy increases at all wavelengths .",
    "the effects of these variations in the shape and total luminosity of the input sed on the predicted ir dust emission spectrum are illustrated in figures [ fig : var_age_sfr]a , [ fig : var_age_sfr]b , and [ fig : cnsmass_comp ] .    as is seen in figure [ fig : var_age_sfr]b , increasing the sfr rate at a constant age results in a shift of the peak of the ir emission to shorter wavelengths .",
    "since the shape of the input sed does not change , but only the total amount of input energy , the dust absorbs the same fraction of the total energy ( @xmath097% for the cases plotted here ) and the absorbed energy is distributed between the high and low density clumps in the same fractions as well .",
    "the result is that as the total amount of input energy is increased , all of the dust is heated to higher temperatures and the ir emission increases and its peak shifts to shorter wavelengths .",
    "similarly , in the case of increasing age , the total ir emission from dust increases and the peak of the ir emission also shifts to shorter wavelengths .",
    "however , the effects are much less pronounced ( figure [ fig : var_age_sfr]a ) .",
    "the reason for the smaller effect is three - fold .",
    "( 1 ) since the stellar population is aging , the same mass of stars produces less energy compared to a young , high sfr burst .",
    "therefore , increasing the mass of the starburst by increasing its age results in a much smaller increase in the energy available for absorption in the dust as compared to increasing the mass by the same amount by increasing the sfr .",
    "( 2 ) the input sed has changed shape so there is a larger contribution to the total input energy at optical and nir wavelengths , resulting in less efficient dust absorption since the efficiency of dust at absorbing and scattering radiation decreases with increasing wavelength . as a result , energy is less likely to be absorbed and the fraction of the total energy absorbed by the dust falls from @xmath097% to @xmath083% for the cases plotted in figure [ fig : var_age_sfr]a .",
    "( 3 ) also as a result of the decreasing efficiency of dust absorption , a higher fraction of the total energy is absorbed in high density bins with increasing starburst age . since the low density medium is heated to a higher temperature for a given input energy ,",
    "the shift to increasing importance of the high density clumps results in a smaller overall temperature increase , and hence less of a shift in the peak of the dust emission to shorter wavelengths , than would be the case if the relative fraction of energy absorbed in the high and low density media remained constant .",
    "for the cases plotted in figure [ fig : var_age_sfr]a , the fraction of the energy absorbed in the high density clumps increases from @xmath068% to @xmath082% for the starburst ages considered .",
    "the difference between the constant sfr rate and the constant age models is illustrated in figure [ fig : cnsmass_comp ] .",
    "the solid line represents the sed of a model with a total stellar mass of @xmath191  m@xmath192 ( sfr=1.6  m@xmath192  yr@xmath21 , age=40  myr ) .",
    "we increase the mass of the model to @xmath193  m@xmath192 by increasing the sfr to 200  m@xmath192  yr@xmath21 keeping the age constant ( dashed line ) and by keeping the sfr constant and increasing the age to 5  gyr ( dotted line ) . increasing the age increases the total dust emission by a small fraction and shifts the peak wavelength of the dust emission slightly to shorter wavelengths . on the other hand , increasing the sfr dramatically increases the total dust emission and shifts the peak wavelength significantly .",
    "in this paper and a companion paper @xcite , we have presented the dirtymodel , a self - consistent monte carlo radiative transfer and dust emission model .",
    "the strengths of dirtyinclude :    * self - consistency . no _ ad hoc _ assumptions about the dust temperature are made ; the dust is heated by the absorption of photons originating from sources included in the model . the temperature distribution of the dust grains , and hence their emission spectrum , is calculated self - consistently by keeping track of the energy absorbed by dust in the monte carlo radiative transfer . *",
    "treatment of the heating of and emission from small grains , including the effects of temperature fluctuations resulting from the absorption of single photons . *",
    "the ability to properly treat high optical depth situations .",
    "the iterative solution outlined above , wherein dust self - absorption is considered , permits the treatment of high optical depth cases , where the optically thin assumption may be violated even at ir wavelengths . * properly including the fir emission from dust in dirtyprovides additional information regarding the dust model , the nature of the heating source(s ) , and the physical size of the modeled region , not available through uv ",
    "nir modeling alone . *",
    "the use of monte carlo techniques to solve the radiative transfer equations allows the treatment of arbitrary dust and heating source distributions as well as inhomogeneous dust distributions ( clumpiness ) . though we have concentrated on starburst galaxies in exploring the parameter space of dirty@xmath194",
    ", it is of general applicability and can be used to model e.g. , dust tori in agns and quasars , circumstellar discs , individual star forming regions , and reflection nebulae .    to emphasize this last point , we point out that the fits to any uv ",
    "nir sed are degenerate ; there are in general several possible combinations of geometries , dust models and heating sources which can provide essentially identical fits to the sed . however , by examining the ir dust spectrum ( total energy emitted by dust , peak wavelength of the ir emission , the strength of the mid ir emission relative to longer ir wavelengths , and strength of ir absorption and emission features ) , some of the degeneracy in the uv ",
    "nir models can be lifted .",
    "indeed , the fir dust spectrum provides information on the physical size of the region not accessible to uv ",
    "nir modeling alone .",
    "future papers will detail the application of dirtyto interpreting observations of astrophysical systems including individual starburst galaxies .",
    "improvements to the current model are also being implemented .",
    "we have presented a fairly simple treatment of the pah component here ; we have not included a means of varying the relative strengths of the pah features . since the strengths of some of the features depend on the number of hydrogen atoms in the molecule , while others depend on the number of carbon atoms ,",
    "the relative strengths can be varied by adjusting the hydrogen coverage , @xmath195 ( see  [ sec : dust_model ] ) .",
    "applications to specific , individual objects will require this sort of fine tuning as the relative strengths of the mir emission features are observed to change from object to object and environment to environment @xcite .",
    "a major area of effort will be in applying dirtyin a starburst model that will include multiple stellar populations and evolutionary effects .",
    "this will require the inclusion of the effects of the interaction between on - going star formation and dust , including the evolution of the grains due to processing , formation , and destruction ( e.g. efstathiou , rowan - robinson & siebenmorgen 2000 ) .",
