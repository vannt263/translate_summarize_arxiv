    "studies of networks  @xcite initially focused on local characteristics or on macroscopic distributions ( of individual nodes and edges ) , but it is now common to consider `` mesoscale '' structures such as communities  @xcite . indeed , there are numerous notions of community structure in networks .",
    "for example , one can define a network s community structure based on a hard or soft partitioning of network into sets of nodes that are connected more densely among themselves than to nodes in other sets  @xcite , and one can also examine community structure by partitioning edges  @xcite .",
    "one can also determine community structure by taking the perspective of a dynamical system ( e.g. , a markov process ) on a network  @xcite .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for myriad other notions of community structure , which have yielded insights on numerous systems in biology  @xcite , political science  @xcite , sociology  @xcite , and many other areas .",
    "although community structure is the most widely studied mesoscale structure by far , numerous other types exist .",
    "these include notions of role similarity  @xcite and many types of block models  @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most prominent block structure aside from community structure is _ core - periphery structure _",
    "@xcite , in which connections between core nodes and other core nodes are dense , connections between core nodes and peripheral nodes are also dense ( but possibly less dense than core - core connections ) , and peripheral nodes are sparsely connected to other nodes .",
    "core - periphery structure provides a useful complement for community structure  @xcite .",
    "its origins lie in the study of social networks ( e.g. , in international relations )  @xcite , although notions such as `` nestedness '' in ecology also attempt to determine core network components  @xcite . as with community structure ,",
    "there are numerous possible ways to examine core - periphery structure , although this has seldom been explored to date",
    ". a few different notions of core - periphery structure have been developed  @xcite , although there are far fewer of these than there are notions of community structure  @xcite .    in this paper , we contrast two different notions of core - periphery structure  the block - model perspective that we discussed above and a recently - developed notion that is appropriate for transportation networks ( and which need not satisfy the density properties of the block - model notion )  @xcite  by calculating them for several different types of empirical and computer - generated networks . due to the rich variety of types of networks across various areas and disciplines , a wealth of different mesoscale features are possible  @xcite .",
    "we expect a block - model notion of core - periphery structure to be appropriate for social networks , whereas it can be desirable to develop transport - based notions of core - periphery structure for road networks and other transportation networks .",
    "however , this intuition does not imply that application - blind notions can not be useful ( e.g. , a recently - developed block - model notion of core - periphery structure was helpful for analyzing the london metropolitan transportation system  @xcite ) , but it is often desirable for network notions to be driven by applications for further development .",
    "this is also the case for community structure  @xcite , where measures of modularity  @xcite , conductance  @xcite , information cost  @xcite , and partition density ( for communities of edges )  @xcite are all useful .",
    "core - periphery structure depends on context and application , and it is important to compare different notions of core network components when considering core agents in a social network , core banks in a financial system , core streets and intersections in a road network , and so on .",
    "we focus on two different ways of characterizing core - periphery structures in networks : we examine density - based ( or `` structural '' ) coreness using intuition from social networks  in which core agents either have high degree ( or strength , in the case of weighted networks ) , are neighbors of nodes with high degree ( or strength ) , or satisfy both properties  and we examine transport - based coreness by modifying notions of betweenness centrality  @xcite . to contrast these different types of core - periphery structure , we compute statistical properties of coreness measures applied to empirical networks , their correlations to each other , and their correlations to other properties of networks .",
    "with these calculations , we obtain interesting insights on several social , financial , and transportation networks .",
    "an additional contribution of this paper is our extension of the transport - based method in ref .",
    "@xcite to allow the assignment of a coreness measure to edges ( rather than just nodes ) .",
    "such a generalization is clearly important for transportation networks , for which one might want ( or even need ) to focus on edges rather than nodes .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : methods ] , we discuss the methods that we employ in this paper for studying density - based and transport - based core - periphery structure . we examine some social and financial networks in sec .  [ sec : examples_non_transporation_networks ] and several transportation networks in sec .",
    "[ sec : examples_transporation_networks ] . to illustrate the effects of spatial embedding on transportation networks",

    "sec : examples_transporation_networks ] .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "conventional definitions of core - periphery organization rely on connection densities among different sets of nodes ( in the form of block models ) or on structural properties such as node degree and strength .",
    "one approach to studying core - periphery structure relies on finding a group of core nodes or assigning coreness values to nodes by optimizing an objective function  @xcite .",
    "the method introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , which generalizes the basic ( and best known ) formulation in  @xcite , is particularly flexible .",
    "for example , one can detect distinct cores in a network , and one can consider either discrete or continuous measures of coreness .",
    "this notion was used recently to examine the roles of brain regions for learning a simple motor task in functional brain networks  @xcite .    in the method of ref .",
    "@xcite , one seeks to calculate a centrality measure of coreness called a `` core score '' ( cs ) using the adjacency - matrix elements @xmath0 , where @xmath1 , the network has @xmath2 nodes , and the value @xmath3 indicates the weight of the connection between nodes @xmath4 and @xmath5 . for directed networks ( see the discussion below ) , we use @xmath3 to denote the weight of the connection from node @xmath4 to node @xmath5 . when @xmath6 , there is no edge between @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we insert the core - matrix elements @xmath7 into the core quality @xmath8 where the parameter @xmath9 $ ] determines the sharpness of the core - periphery division and @xmath10 $ ] determines the fraction of core nodes .",
    "we decompose the core - matrix elements into a product form , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 are the elements of a core vector .",
    "reference  @xcite also discusses the use of alternative `` transition functions '' to the one in eq .",
    "( [ transition_function ] ) .",
    "we wish to determine the core - vector elements in ( [ transition_function ] ) so that the core quality in eq .",
    "( [ core_quality ] ) is maximized .",
    "this yields a cs for node @xmath4 of @xmath13 where the normalization factor @xmath14 is determined so that the maximum value of cs over the entire set of nodes is 1 . in practice , we perform the optimization using some computational heuristic and some sample of points in the parameter space with coordinates @xmath15 \\times [ 0,1]$ ] . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we use simulated annealing  @xcite ( with the same cooling schedule as in that paper ) .",
    "this adds stochasticity to the method .",
    "the core - quality landscape tends to be less sensitive to @xmath16 than it is to @xmath17 , so one can reduce the number of @xmath16 values for computationally expensive situations if it is necessary .",
    "for all examples in this paper , we use the sampling resolutions @xmath18 and thus consider @xmath19 evenly - spaced points in the ( @xmath20 plane .    for directed networks ,",
    "one can still technically compute cs values because eq .",
    "is still valid when the matrix @xmath21 is asymmetric , so that is what we will do in the present paper .",
    "however , it seems strange to produce only one set of core scores rather than two sets of them ( just like one wishes to compute both in - degrees from out - degrees in a directed network ) , and the @xmath22 and @xmath23 interactions are confounded in eq .   because @xmath3 and @xmath24 appear on equal footing .",
    "( the transport - based notions of core - periphery structure that we will discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : transport_cp ] apply naturally to both directed and undirected networks ; this follows the spirit of directed flow on networks . )",
    "it is both interesting and desirable to investigate density - based notions ( e.g. , via block models ) of core - periphery structure for directed networks , but we will not pursue that in this paper .",
    "such notions would allow one to distinguish between core sources and core sinks .",
    "notions of betweenness centrality ( bc ) are useful for characterizing transportation properties of networks  @xcite , and ideas based on short paths have been used to examine core - periphery structure  @xcite .    in our discussion of transport - based core - periphery structures",
    ", we will draw on a notion that was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and was inspired by geodesic node betweenness centrality . in this paper",
    ", we will also define an analogous notion for core and peripheral edges .",
    "the basic idea is that core network components ( e.g. , nodes or edges ) are used more frequently for transportation , as quantified by a bc or a similar diagnostic , than peripheral components . to amplify the usage of connections from arbitrary parts of a network to core parts , we consider `` backup paths , '' which are the shortest paths that remain after some part or parts of a network have been removed , .",
    "we consider networks that can be either weighted or unweighted and either directed or undirected .",
    "let the set of edges be denoted by @xmath25 where node @xmath5 is connected to @xmath26 .",

    "@xmath31 _ is removed from _",
    "@xmath32 , and @xmath28 = 0 $ ] otherwise .    just as betweenness centralities can be defined for edges  @xcite ( as well as other network components )",
    "in addition to nodes , it is useful to calculate a ps for edges .",
    "we define the path score @xmath33 of edge @xmath34 similarly to the node ps from eq .",
    "( [ ps_formula ] ) , except that we replace the node @xmath4 with the edge @xmath34 .",
    "that is , @xmath35 if @xmath34 is a part of one of the optimal backup paths from node @xmath5 to node @xmath30 ; otherwise , @xmath36 .",
    "calculating a value of coreness for edges is particularly relevant for networks in which edges are fundamentally important physical , logical , or social entities  @xcite .",
    "a ps for a network component quantifies its importance by examining centrality scores after other components have been removed .",
    "the importance of edges in road networks has been studied previously using the different ( and much more computationally demanding ) task of quantifying the importance of a removed edge by calculating bcs both before and after its removal  @xcite .",
    "backup paths have also been studied in the context of percolation  @xcite .",
    "the notion of a ps is deterministic whenever it is based on a deterministic notion of betweenness .",
    "( recall that the use of simulated annealing as a computational heuristic to calculate css is a source of stochasticity for the formulation of core - periphery structure in sec .  [",
    "sec : structural_cp ] . )",
    "even when there exists more than one optimal backup path ( which , in practice , occurs mostly for unweighted networks ) , all of the optimal paths @xmath29 contribute equally to the ps .",
    "one can , of course , incorporate stochasticity by constructing a ps based on a stochastic notion of centrality ( e.g. , random - walk node betweenness  @xcite ) .",
    "in the present paper , we calculate ps values based on shortest paths ( i.e. , `` geodesic ps values '' ) as well as ps values based on greedy - spatial - navigation ( gsn ) paths , which are constructed from local directional information and correspond to a more realistic form of navigation than geodesic paths for spatially embedded networks  @xcite .",
    "we use the acronym ps to indicate a path score that is determined via shortest paths and gsnp for a path score that is determined via a gsn path , which we define as follows  @xcite . consider a network with @xmath2 nodes that is embedded in @xmath37 , and suppose that the coordinates of the nodes are @xmath38,\\ldots , [ x_1(n),x_2(n),\\ldots , x_d(n)]\\}$ ] .",
    "assume that an agent stands at a node @xmath4 and wishes to travel to node @xmath39 .",
    "let @xmath40 be the vector from node @xmath4 to node @xmath5 , and let @xmath41 $ ] be the angle between @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "a greedy navigator considers the set @xmath44 of neighbors of @xmath4 and it moves to the neighbor @xmath45 that has the smallest @xmath46 , where ties are broken by taking a neighbor uniformly at random among the neighbors with the smallest angle .",
    "if all neighbors @xmath45 have been visited , then the navigator goes back to the node that it left to reach @xmath4 .",
    "this procedure is repeated until node @xmath39 is reached ( which will happen eventually if @xmath47 is connected , or , more generally , if @xmath4 and @xmath5 belong to the same component ) .",
    "it is important at this stage to comment about weight versus `` distance '' in weighted networks . in a weighted network ,",
    "a larger weight represents a closer or stronger relation .",
    "if we are given such a network ( with weight - matrix elements @xmath3 ) , we construct a distance matrix whose elements are @xmath48 for nonzero @xmath3 and @xmath49 when @xmath6 .",
    "we then use the distance matrix to determine the length of a path and in all of our calculations of pss , gsnps , and bcs .",
    "alternatively , we might start with a set of network distances or euclidean distances , and then we can use that information directly . in this paper",
    ", we will consider transportation networks that are embedded in @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "in contrast to css , we can calculate pss for directed networks very naturally simply by restricting ourselves to directed paths .",

    "we consider data associated with such values that come in one of two forms . in one form , we have a matrix entry @xmath3 for which a larger value indicates a closer ( or stronger ) relationship between nodes @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( where @xmath52 ) . in this case",

    "we start by determining the locations of nodes either in the unit square ( for 2d roadlike networks ) or in the unit cube ( for the 3d case ) .",
    "we then add edges by constructing a minimum spanning tree ( mst ) via kruskal s algorithm  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath57 denote the total ( euclidean ) length of the mst .",

    "( when there is a tie , we pick one shortcut uniformly at random from the set of all shortcuts that minimize the shortest path length . ) our final network is the set of nodes and edges right before the step that would force us to exceed this threshold by adding a new shortcut .",

    "we generate synthetic roadlike networks by placing 100 nodes uniformly at random inside of a unit square ( 2d ) or cube ( 3d ) , and we use a threshold of @xmath78 for the total length of the edges . in fig .",

    "we consider 50 different initial node locations in each case , but that is the only source of stochasticity ( except for another small source of stochasticity from the tie - breaking rule ) because the construction process itself is deterministic .",
    "our main observation from examining these synthetic networks is that correlations of cs values with other quantities ( geodesic ps values , gsnp values , and bc values ) are much larger in the 3d networks than in the 2d networks ( see table  [ summarytable_transport ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the embedding dimension of the roadlike networks is related to the correlations that we see in coreness ( and betweenness ) measures .    to further investigate the effects of the spatial embedding",
    ", we compare the results from the 2d generative model with a generative model that is the same except for a modified rule that allows some intersecting edges .",
    "as shown in table  [ summarytable_transport ] , the correlation values between ps values and geodesic bc values for the modified model are slightly larger than in the original model , though not that many edges cross each other in practice [ see figs .",
    "[ null_cs_ps](e ) and ( f ) ] . therefore",
    ", although prohibiting edge crossings has some effect on correlations , the fact that most edges can be drawn in the same plane when edge crossings are allowed ( i.e. , the graphs in the modified model are `` almost 2d '' in some sense ) suggests that the dimension in which a network ( or most of a network ) is embedded might have a larger effect on correlations between coreness ( and betweenness ) measures than the edge - crossing rule .",
    "in this paper , we examined two types of core - periphery structure  one developed using intuition from social networks and another developed using intuition from transportation networks  in several networks from a diverse set of applications .",
    "we showed that correlations between these different types of structures can be very different in different types of networks .",
    "this underscores the fact that it is important to develop different notions of core - periphery structure that are appropriate for different situations .",
    "we also illustrated in our case studies that coreness measures can detect important nodes and edges .",
    "for roadlike networks , we also examined the effect of spatial embeddedness on correlations between coreness measures .",
    "as with the study of community structure ( and many other network concepts ) , the notion of core - periphery structure is context - dependent .",
    "for example , we illustrated that the intuition behind what one considers a core road or junction in a road ( or roadlike ) network is different from the intuition behind what one considers to be a core node in a social network .",
    "consequently , it is important to develop and investigate ( and examine correlations between ) different notions of core - periphery structure .",
    "we have taken a step in this direction through our case studies in this paper , and we also obtained insights in several applications .",
    "our work also raises interesting questions .",
    "for example , how much of the structure of the rabbit warren stems from the fact that it is embedded in 3d , how much of its structure stems from its roadlike nature , and how much of its structure depends fundamentally on the fact that it was created by rabbits ( but would be different from other roadlike networks that are also embedded in 3d ) ?",
