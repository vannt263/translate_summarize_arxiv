    "in a preceding paper @xcite ( to be referred as [ i ] ) we have emphasized the significance to improve a lattice action for the continuum limit and have shown our strategy to do it in renormalization group approach for asymptotically free lattice theories such as 2d nonlinear o(n ) sigma models and 4d su(n ) gauge models , most attention has been paid to the former . in particular , the correlation function on the renormalized trajectory has been explicitly obtained near the non - trivial fixed point by block spin renormalization group in perturbation theory .",
    "an improved action has been obtained from the criterion that it is most close to the renormalized trajectory by defining a distance from an action to the renormalized trajectory .",
    "a criterion has been also given for the scaling behavior of physical quantities obtained by monte carlo ( mc ) simulations with a given lattice action .",
    "in this paper we will make a similar analysis for 4d su(n ) gauge models .",
    "we will not repeat in principle the general discussions given already in [ i ] to avoid the repetition .",
    "therefore we assume that the reader is familiar with [ i ] .",
    "the organization of this paper is parallel to that of [ i ] , except for that the sections which correspond to sections 8 and 9 of [ i ] do not exist in this paper : the model is defined in section [ section2 ] , block spin transformation is introduced in section [ section3 ] , the expectation values of various wilson loops on the renormalized trajectory are obtained in section [ section4 ] and the block spin transformation is performed for various lattice actions in section [ section5 ] .",
    "an improved action is obtained in section [ section6 ] , implications of our results for mc calculations are discussed in section [ section7 ] and the connection between the existence of instantons on the lattice and the renormalized trajectory is given in section [ section8 ] .",
    "section [ section9 ] is devoted to discussion . in the appendix [ appendixa ] the explicit form of the propagator",
    "is given and in the appendix [ appendixb ] the derivation of eq.([eq.3 - 9 ] ) is given .",
    "+    we take a four - dimensional hyper - cubic lattice and denote the sites of the lattice by an integer - valued four vector @xmath0 .",
    "the link variables of the su(n ) lattice gauge theory are @xmath1 unitary matrices and denoted by @xmath2 for the oriented link from @xmath0 to @xmath3 . for the oriented link from @xmath3 to @xmath0 we assign @xmath4 .",
    "there are infinitely many choices for lattice actions which give the same naive continuum limit .",
    "for example , we adopt four coupling gauge action , including up to six - link loop : @xmath5 four type of loop are depicted in fig.[fig1 ] . in sum over loops",
    ", each oriented loop appears once .    in the week coupling expansion",
    "the link variable is parameterized as @xmath6 end the action is expanded in terms of the field @xmath7 . requiring that the action ( [ eq.2 - 1 ] ) reduces to @xmath8 in the naive continuum limit , we obtain the normalization condition @xmath9 we have to fix the gauge in perturbation calculation .",
    "we take the lattice lorentz gauge given by @xmath10 let us introduce the following fourier transformation @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes @xmath13 . here",
    "and hereafter we make a change of variable from @xmath14 to @xmath15 .",

    "note that the free part of action depends on only the combinations of @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "therefore we have two parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 to choose in the lowest order perturbation theory , because @xmath28 is determined from them by the constraint ( [ eq.2 - 4 ] ) .",
    "we will make the perturbation calculation with this free action .",
    "let us denote the expectation value in the perturbation theory as @xmath29 the free propagator of @xmath30 is defined by @xmath31 for example , @xmath32 is given by @xmath33    the expectation value of various wilson loops can be written in the lowest order of perturbation theory as @xmath34 where c denotes the wilson loop .",
    "note that @xmath35 is independent of @xmath36 .",
    "the @xmath35 for some particular wilson loops are given as follows :    [ eq.2 - 18 ] @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40}\\ ] ]    here @xmath41 is for @xmath42 rectangular loop , @xmath43 is for the loop depicted in fig.[fig1].c , @xmath44 for the loop in fig.[fig1].d . the 4-dimensional loop in eq.([eq.2 - 18d ] ) may be described by the loop : @xmath45",
    "first note a difference between 2d o(n ) sigma model and 4d su(n ) gauge model in that the variables are site - variables for the former , while they are link - variables for the later .",
    "therefore we propose to make blocks of link variables in 4d su(n ) gauge models , rather than blocks of sites .",
    "see fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "secondly we are interested in the limit @xmath46 and in the physical quantities for which perturbation theory is applicable . as discussed in the first section of [ i ] , the correlation length is large near the critical point @xmath47 and diverges at the critical point as a result of cooperative behavior of the system . within the correlation length the properties of the system do not change qualitatively . therefore , if we make the weak coupling expansion , the variables @xmath7 do not change rapidly within the correlation length .    thus we propose to define a block transformation by @xmath48\\ ] ] and @xmath49 note that the normalization constant is @xmath50 rather than @xmath51 , because the length of the link in the new system is @xmath52 . except for the normalization , eq.([eq.3 - 1 ] ) is similar to eq.(3.1 ) in ( i )",
    ". therefore let us write eq.(3.1 ) simply as    [ eq.3 - 1a ] @xmath53    and let us call this transformation block spin transformation , although the variable is not spin - variable .",
    "the block spin transformation is applied repeatedly . a block variable @xmath54 after @xmath55 iteration is defined as @xmath56 and @xmath57 the effective action after the block spin transformation is defined through the relation @xmath58 where @xmath59 the renormalization group @xmath60 is defined as @xmath61 the @xmath62 is the original action and @xmath63 is the original variable @xmath7 .",
    "this transformation is slightly different from that proposed by wilson @xcite , although it is the same in spirit .",
    "this difference becomes , however , crucial when ones consider the limit @xmath64 , as will be shown in the next section .",
    "let us calculate the expectation value of various wilson loops for the @xmath55 block link variables in the perturbation theory .",
    "let us denote them as @xmath65 following eq.([eq.2 - 17 ] ) .",
    "the expectation value is taken with the action @xmath66 .",
    "as is in 2d o(n ) sigma model , it is easy to calculate @xmath67 in terms of the original variables in the perturbation theory .",
    "we obtain    [ eq.3 - 9 ] @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 h^{(i)}(k)}.\\ ] ]    here @xmath72 @xmath73 and @xmath74 where @xmath75 the derivation of eq.([eq.3 - 9 ] ) is given in the appendix [ appendixb ] .",
    "the gauge for the block variables @xmath76 is not the lattice lorentz gauge , in general .",
    "this is not the problem to calculate @xmath67 , as is shown above .",
    "in the previous section we have obtained the expectation value of various wilson loops for block link variables after @xmath55 iteration . in the limit @xmath64 , the effective action @xmath77 should approach the renormalized trajectory .",
    "therefore the expectation value of the wilson loop also should approach to that on the renormalized trajectory .",
    "let us denote @xmath78 in this section we will derive @xmath79 .    first note @xmath80 the first term in the r.h.s . is the dominant contribution to the expectation value in the limit @xmath64 . as in the section 4 of [ i ] , we are able to prove that the non - leading terms which come from the second term of the r.h.s . of eq.([eq.4 - 2 ] ) do not contribute to the expectation value in the limit @xmath64 .",
    "hence we neglect them .",
    "therefore we have to consider only @xmath81 with @xmath82 .",
    "+ secondly let us remind that @xmath83 now let us consider , for example , @xmath84 . from eqs.([eq.4 - 2 ] ) and",
    "( [ eq.4 - 3 ] ) we have @xmath85\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath86 the approximate equality in eq.([eq.4 - 4 ] ) means that only the leading terms are taken .",
    "equation ( [ eq.4 - 4 ] ) may be written as @xmath87\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the factor @xmath88 are multiplied for the denominator and the coefficient .",
    "putting @xmath89 as in [ i ] , we obtain finally @xmath90 introducing the function @xmath91 defined by @xmath92 and setting @xmath93 and so on , we obtain @xmath94 we are able to obtain other @xmath79 similarly .",
    "let us introduce the symbol @xmath95 for notational simplicity .",
    "then we have , for example , @xmath96 \\nonumber\\\\ f^{(\\infty)}(2\\times 2 ) & = & \\sqiint 8\\left[\\tilde{\\tilde{f}}(0,0,0,0 ) + \\tilde{\\tilde{f}}(1,0,0,0 ) - \\tilde{\\tilde{f}}(2,0,0,0 ) - \\tilde{\\tilde{f}}(2,1,0,0)\\right ]   \\nonumber\\\\ f^{(\\infty)}(\\text{chair } ) & = & \\sqiint \\left[6\\tilde{\\tilde{f}}(0,0,0,0 ) - 4\\tilde{\\tilde{f}}(1,0,0,0 ) -2\\tilde{\\tilde{f}}(1,1,0,0)\\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ f^{(\\infty)}(\\text{3-dim } ) & = & \\sqiint 6\\left[\\tilde{\\tilde{f}}(0,0,0,0 ) - \\tilde{\\tilde{f}}(1,1,0,0)\\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ f^{(\\infty)}(\\text{4-dim } ) & = & \\sqiint 6\\left[\\tilde{\\tilde{f}}(0,0,0,0 ) - \\tilde{\\tilde{f}}(1,1,1,0)\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it should be noted that it is non - trivial that @xmath67 approach finite constant value in the limit @xmath64 .",
    "it depends on the definition of renormalization group .",
    "if we had taken the renormalization group proposed in the ref.@xcite , we would obtain that @xmath79 are trivially zero : because the length of the new link after the renormalization does not change from that of the original link , we have the sum over only @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 in the equation corresponding to eq.([eq.4 - 3 ] ) and consequently we have an extra factor @xmath100 which vanishes in the limit @xmath64 , in the equation corresponding to eq.([eq.4 - 7 ] ) .",
    "now we are ready to calculate the function @xmath67 of the block variables for any parameter @xmath26 and @xmath101 , using eqs.([eq.3 - 9])@xmath102([eq.3 - 13 ] ) .",
    "we first list some of them for the standard model @xmath103 together with @xmath79 obtained from eqs.([eq.4 - 10 ] ) and ( [ eq.4 - 11 ] ) .",
    "we clearly see from the table [ table1 ] that the functions gradually approach the asymptotic values .",
    "we also list some of @xmath67 in the table [ table1 ] for @xmath104 ( model w ) which has been chosen by wilson in ref.@xcite , for @xmath105 ( model wz ) which has been chosen by weisz @xcite in symanzik approach @xcite , as well as for @xmath106 ( model im11 ) and for @xmath107 ( model im22 ) which will be chosen by a certain criterion below . in fig.[fig3 ] we depict block spin transformation flows for the function @xmath67 .",
    "we see from the figure and the table that the behavior of the convergence for the function to the fixed point crucially on the parameter @xmath26 and @xmath108 .    table 1-a model s ( @xmath109 )    .the values of @xmath67 for various models together with @xmath79 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "according to our strategy described in detail in [ i ] , let us choose an action which is located near the renormalized trajectory .",
    "first let us note that there is no difference between interaction , for example , @xmath110 and @xmath111 in the lowest order perturbation theory .",
    "therefore we assume that the action is of the form @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the wilson loop for the contour @xmath114 .",
    "practically we have to truncate the sum in eq.([eq.6 - 1 ] ) .",
    "let us restrict actions to those given by eq.([eq.2 - 1 ] ) .",
    "we define a distance from an action to the renormalized trajectory by @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the number of terms in the sum over the contour @xmath114 .",
    "we restrict the contour in the sum to those up to six - link length .",
    "plotting @xmath117 and @xmath118 defined above in the two - dimensional space spanned by @xmath26 and @xmath108 , we find that there is a one - dimensional very narrow deep valley where @xmath117 and @xmath118 are very small , respectively . for @xmath117",
    ", the one - dimensional line is parameterized by the equation @xmath119 and for @xmath118 @xmath120    along the line defined by eq.([eq.6 - 3 ] ) , @xmath117 is less than @xmath121 and the variation of @xmath117 is not so rapid as far as @xmath122 .",
    "the minimum of @xmath117 is about @xmath123 at @xmath124 and @xmath125 ( to be referred as point im12 ) .",
    "when we put @xmath126 , the minimum of @xmath117 is about @xmath127 at @xmath128 ( point im11 ) .",
    "note that the values of @xmath117 do not differ so much between the two points .    along the line defined by eq.([eq.6 - 4 ] )",
    ", @xmath118 is less than 0.0025 and the variation of @xmath118 is not so rapid as far as @xmath122 .",
    "the minimum of @xmath118 is about @xmath129 at @xmath124 and @xmath130 ( point im22 ) .",
    "when we put @xmath126 , the minimum is about 0.00242 at @xmath131 ( point im21 ) .",
    "if we could perform mc simulations with parameters @xmath26 and @xmath132 ( or @xmath133 ) on a very large lattice , the action im22 could be the best action among those considered up to here . however , it makes a large difference for computer time in mc simulations whether we include the @xmath132 ( or @xmath133 ) term or not . on the other hand",
    "there is no large difference between action im22 and action im21 , or between action im12 and action im11 from the view point of renormalization group .",
    "therefore it is practically better to choose action im21 or action im11 .",
    "there is also a limitation on the size of the lattice where we make mc simulations .",
    "for example , we will measure the string tension @xcite on a @xmath134 lattice for su(3 ) lattice gauge theory . in this case the string tension is mainly determined by the creutz ratio @xcite @xmath135 ( and @xmath136 ) .",
    "the @xmath135 is determined from @xmath137 and @xmath138 . on the other hand , @xmath139 , for example",
    ", contains the contributions from the propagator @xmath140 up to @xmath141 and @xmath142 , while @xmath143 contains those up to @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "thus to obtain the wilson loops such as @xmath146 or @xmath147 , the criterion based on @xmath117 is better than on @xmath118 . from this consideration and an analysis of instantons on the lattice",
    "( see section [ section8 ] ) , we choose the model im11 as an improved action ( model i m ) .",
    "when we make mc simulations on a lattice , e. g. , @xmath148 , we may choose the model im21 as an improved action .",
    "anyway the difference concerning @xmath149 between models im11 and im21 is not large .    in ref.@xcite , we have measured the string tension on a @xmath134 lattice for the su(2 ) lattice gauge theory with the action @xmath150 , @xmath151 ( model r3 ) .",
    "this action has been chosen from the consideration of the scale parameter and an analysis of instantons on the lattice .",
    "for this action @xmath152 . compare this value with @xmath153 for model w , @xmath154 for model wz and @xmath155 for model s. thus the model r3 is also an improved action compared with models wz and s : as far as @xmath156 ( with @xmath157 ) for which @xmath158 , any action can be taken as an improved action .    in ref.@xcite",
    "we have chosen @xmath159 as a parameter for the distance between an action and action w. it seems that a line where @xmath118 , for example , is constant corresponds approximately to a line where the scale parameter @xmath160 is constant , as noted in [ i ] for 2d o(n ) sigma models .",
    "thus the criterion chosen in ref.@xcite for the distance is reasonable even from the view point of the renormalization group .",
    "note that model wz is not an improved action due to our criteria : the value @xmath154 implies that model wz is far from the renormalization trajectory , and the life time of instantons on the lattice is short . on the other hand ,",
    "model w is an improved action ; although @xmath117 is slightly larger than that of model im11 or that of model r3 , it is of the same order .",
    "as far we have already discussed the general feature of the renormalization group and our strategy in section 7 of [ i ] , we do not repeat them here . according to our strategy ,",
    "let us set an upper limit @xmath161 for the relative difference between @xmath67 and @xmath79 as @xmath162 .",
    "then for model i m we have @xmath163 as the minimum number of iteration for which @xmath164 is satisfied . on the other hand for model",
    "s we have @xmath165 .",
    "this implies that the wilson loops @xmath166 agree with @xmath167 within relative difference @xmath121 for @xmath168 in the case of model i m , according to our discussion in section 7 of [ i ] .",
    "this further implies that the creutz ratio @xmath169 take their asymptotic value on the renormalized trajectory for @xmath170 .    on the other hand , the wilson loop @xmath166 for model i m corresponds to the wilson loop @xmath171 for model s.",
    "thus it is only expected that the creutz ratios @xmath169 take their asymptotic values on the renormalization trajectory , for @xmath172 with precision @xmath121 in the case of model s. ( see fig.[fig4 ] ) this is the reason why we call i m the improved action .",
    "for both models are of the same other . ]",
    "the general discussion on instantons on the lattice given in section 10 of [ i ] can be also applied for 4d su(n ) gauge models .",
    "thus we conclude also for 4d su(n ) gauge models that the renormalized trajectory is located at the boundary which devides the parameter space into two parts : in one of them instantons exist , while in the other instantons do not exist .",
    "we further conclude that the one - dimensional line such as defined by eq.([eq.6 - 4 ] ) divides the two - dimensional space spanned by @xmath26 and @xmath108 into the two parts .",
    "see fig.[fig5 ] .",
    "it is rather difficult to verify this conclusion numerically compared with the case of 2d o(3 ) sigma model , because it takes a lot of computer time to do it .",
    "therefore we have investigated @xcite the existence of instantons on a lattice with size of @xmath173 with @xmath26 being varied and with @xmath151 by the method described in ref.@xcite .",
    "we have found the following : for model @xmath174 ( @xmath175 ) we have instantons with topological number @xmath176 for ten random starts , for model im11 ( @xmath128 ) we have instantons with @xmath177 and for model im21 ( @xmath131 ) we have instantons with @xmath178 . for @xmath179 , we have no stable instantons on the lattice .",
    "thus the point @xmath180 is critical .",
    "this is consistent with the above conclusion .",
    "one reason in addition to the reason given in section [ section6 ] why we choose model im11 rather than model im21 as an improved action for a @xmath134 lattice is that we have no instantons with @xmath181 for model im21 on a @xmath173 lattice as far as we have investigated .",
    "we expect that if the size of the lattice is large enough , e.g. , @xmath148 , instantons with @xmath181 also will exist on the lattice for model im21 .     and @xmath108 .",
    "the general discussion given in section 11 of [ i ] can be also applied for 4d su(n ) gauge models .",
    "we state here only briefly the main points .",
    "the improved action near the renormalized trajectory has been determined by the perturbation theory in our approach .",
    "we are able to calculate non - perturbative effects using this action by mc simulations .",
    "the effect of instantons , for example , is properly taken into account even on a lattice with small size .",
    "a different approach to improve lattice action is proposed by symanzik @xcite .",
    "the perturbation theory can not be applied for calculation of physical quantities such as the string tension where non - perturbative effects are crucial .",
    "it appears that this limitation is not properly taken into consideration in symazik s approach .",
    "as shown in section [ section6 ] , the `` improved '' action obtained by weisz @xcite in symanzik s approach is not an improved action in our criteria .",
    "the continuum limit of a lattice theory is unique and universal for a wide class of lattice action because of the following facts : i ) the renormalized trajectory is unique and ii ) the trajectory for any lattice action approaches asymptotically the renormalized trajectory , if the action belongs to the domain in the parameter space which is governed by the non - trivial fixed point .",
    "however , it crucially depends on the form of the action how rapidly the trajectory approaches the renormalized trajectory .",
    "we have given a criterion to estimate this rapidity . from the criterion we can guess the coupling constant where we may expect that the expectation value of a physical quantity is identical with that on the renormalized trajectory .",
    "the point is not that a physical quantity approximately shows a scaling form , but that it is identical with that on the renormalized trajectory .",
    "we would like to calculate various physical quantities with an improved action due to our criteria in addition to the string tension of the su(3 ) gauge theory @xcite .",
    "we hope that the mass ratios of mesons to baryons will become realistic with an improved action of a relatively small lattice .",
    "we also conjecture that the first order phase transition @xcite observed in su(4 ) and su(5 ) gauge theories with the standard action will not be observed with an improved action , because no phase transition will occur on the renormalized trajectory .",
    "we finally argue that osterwalder - schrader @xcite ( os ) positivity is satisfied on the renormalized trajectory and consequently it is satisfied , at least approximately , for the improved action of 4d su(n ) gauge models , from the same reasoning given in [ i ] .",
