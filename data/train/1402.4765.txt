    "the earliest results from this facility ( morton et al .",
    "1973 ) exhibited a pattern of element depletions that led field ( 1974 ) to conclude that the severities of depletions are strongly linked to the temperatures at which the respective elements condense into solid compounds in matter being expelled from the outer portions of stellar atmospheres .",

    "savage and sembach ( 1996 ) provided an excellent review of these early accomplishments with hst .",

    "the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( fuse ) , launched in 1999 , extended our coverage to a wavelength band between the lyman limit and the short- wavelength cutoff of hst .",

    "r0.4        during the first 35 years of observations using the orbiting observatories to gather absorption line data , there had emerged a large number of publications that reported on a heterogeneous mix of different element abundances over a diverse collection of sight lines .",
    "the results by themselves were of significant value and led to interesting conclusions .",
    "nevertheless , there still remained a need to consolidate the information from different sources and then systematically describe the outcomes in terms that linked the depletion of each element to those of the others , and at the same time , accounted for the variations that were known to take place from one region to the next .",
    "this task was accomplished in 2009 by jenkins ( 2009 ) , who interpreted the abundances of 17 different elements reported in more than 100 papers that covered 243 sight lines to different stars .",
    "he developed a simple unification scheme that described in straightforward parametric forms the logarithmic depletion factor of any element @xmath3 from the gas phase , @xmath4=\\log\\left({n(x)\\over n({\\rm h})}\\right)_{\\rm obs } -   \\log\\left({x\\over { \\rm h}}\\right)_{\\rm ref}~,\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the column density of element @xmath3 , @xmath6 represents the column density of hydrogen in both atomic and molecular form , i.e. , @xmath7 , and the reference abundance ratio @xmath8 can be taken from either the abundances measured for b - type stars or the sun .",
    "it follows that the missing atoms that make up the relative contribution of element @xmath3 in the form of dust grains or large molecules is given ( in linear terms ) by the expression @xmath9})~.\\ ] ] aside from constructing a unification scheme for element depletions that could lead to dust compositions , jenkins had to exercise many quality control procedures and devise corrections to the earlier results that accounted for updated values for the transition strengths .",
    "the basic foundation for the construction of a unified representation of depletions is based on the observation that any particular combination of two elements exhibits logarithmic depletions that have a linear relationship with each other .",
    "this concept is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ depletion_comparison ] .",
    "when compared to the logarithms of the depletions of p , the logarithmic depletions of mg and fe show a linear trend .",
    "different sight lines have varying degrees of depletions of all three elements , and the overall severity of such depletions for any sight line can be characterized by a single parameter , which jenkins designated as @xmath10 .",
    "the differences in the slopes and intercepts of the trend lines representing a progression of @xmath10 can be represented by just two additional parameters that are unique to each element .",
    "the @xmath10 sight - line parameter depends only on observed depletions , and it replaces the average density @xmath11/d$ ] or molecular hydrogen fraction @xmath12 $ ] as a discriminant that had been used by earlier investigators ( jenkins , et al .",
    "1986 ; cardelli 1994 ; snow et al .",
    "the adopted scale for @xmath10 was arbitrary : jenkins defined @xmath13 to correspond to the weakest depletions that appeared in the survey , while @xmath14 represented the depletions seen toward the well studied , strongly depleted @xmath15 component toward the star @xmath16  oph ( savage , et al .",
    "1992 ) . occasionally , sight lines exhibited values of @xmath10 outside the range @xmath17 .     to the sight - line parameter @xmath10",
    "the zero point @xmath18 for @xmath10 is chosen such that , with the observations and their errors at hand , the covariance of the errors in the other two parameters , @xmath19 ( slope ) and @xmath20 ( vertical offset ) is zero.[basic_equation],width=480 ]    figure  [ basic_equation ] illustrates the manner by which jenkins parameterized the depletion trends for different elements .",
    "table  [ parameters ] lists the values of @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath18 for the 17 elements in the study , along with the adopted reference abundances ( taken to be solar abundances specified by lodders ( 2003 ) ) .",
    "one drawback of having to rely on reference abundances is the fact that some of them are controversial .",
    "figure  [ ref_abundances ] shows that there are some disagreements between b - star abundances ( nieva & przybilla 2012 ) and solar abundances ( asplund et al .",
    "[ we can ask the question `` why is it that for many heavy elements the abundances in the sun ( 4.5  gyr old ) appear to higher than those in young b stars ( several tens of myr old ) ? '' the answer may arise from a suggestion by lyubimkov ( 2013 ) that ionizations in the standard stellar atmosphere models for early - type stars are underestimated . from eq .",

    ".the depletion parameters for 17 elements . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     r0.4",
    "a method for overcoming the effects arising from uncertainties in the reference abundances is to develop an interpretation that avoids having to use them in the first place . instead of attempting to derive the absolute quantities of elements sequestered in the grains ,",
    "we can change our objective to that of monitoring the changes in element abundances as we progress from regions with low values of @xmath10 to ones where the grains have advanced to much greater stages of growth , as indicated by larger values of @xmath10 .",
    "if we substitute the right - hand side of the equation depicted in fig .",
    "[ basic_equation ] into eq .",
    "[ x_dust ] and differentiate the result with respect to @xmath10 , we find that @xmath21 we now have an expression that makes use of only the slope @xmath19 and the ( linear ) expression for the relative abundance of the element @xmath3 with respect to hydrogen in the gas for any particular value of @xmath10 . the resulting consumption rates for different elements are shown in fig .",
    "[ element_consumption ] .",
    "these rates change as the grains mature , indicating that the compositions are driven by the abundance of the remaining gaseous feedstocks ( free atoms ) and perhaps also by the nature of the existing compounds in the grains with which new atoms can combine .",
    "for instance , we can see from the differences in the bar lengths in the figure that there is little change in the consumption rates of c and o , presumably because they remain abundant even after many grains have formed , whereas a less abundant element that starts out being rapidly depleted , such as ti , arrives at the point where there are few atoms left to contribute to further grain growth . from the evidence that is presented here ,",
    "it should be clear that the compositions of the outer mantles of grains differ from their inner cores that formed from gases that had higher concentrations of heavy atoms .",
    "in  [ unified ] we considered that the basic premise for the development of the @xmath10 parameter was that the collective depletion of many elements gives the most reliable indication of the overall level of grain production for any given sight line , after one applies proper scalings to account for the elements depletion behaviors . the small scatter in the relationships between the depletions of most elements and @xmath10",
    "justifies this choice , which appears to be more satisfactory the more traditional methods of using the environmental factors @xmath22 or @xmath23 as guides for grain development . nevertheless , it is of interest to go back and see how well those measures compare with determinations of @xmath10 .",

    "another issue that we can revisit is how well do the element depletion factors scale with the condensation temperature @xmath29 .",
    "this quantity has a specific meaning related to the formation of solid compounds when a cosmic mixture of free atoms experiences a progressive decrease in temperature at some specific pressure , as in the expanding stellar atmospheres or nebulae considered by field ( 1974 ) .",
    "there are , however , alternative processes that can be important .",
    "for instance , we can recognize that @xmath29 correlates well with other properties of atoms , such as ionization potentials ( snow 1975 ) , binding energies to pahs ( klotz et al . 1995 ) , or sublimation energies ( barlow 1978 ) that govern the resistance of compounds to sputtering that can ultimately lead to the destruction of grain materials and the return of atoms to the gas phase . over any large selection of elements ,",
    "these properties are correlated with each other ( e.g. see fig .  5 of ramrez et al .",
    "( 2010 ) for a plot of @xmath29 vs. first ionization potentials ) , so identifying the most important processes is not straightforward .",
    "nevertheless , we can propose that @xmath29 is a useful parameter to examine , even if it does not represent faithfully the most important formation and destruction routes .",
    "the left - hand panel of figure  [ tc_trends ] shows how well the depletions at @xmath30 correlate with @xmath29 . while a trend seems evident , there are some awkward cases that involve 3 elements where _ negative _ depletions are apparent ( i.e. , abundances that seem to be greater than their respective reference abundances ) .",
    "an explanation for these anomalies may rest with either bad measurements , incorrect transition @xmath31-values , or inaccurate reference abundances .",
    "a more satisfactory trend is seen when @xmath19 ( the slope of logarithmic depletions vs. @xmath10 ) is compared with @xmath29 . here , the dependences on @xmath31-values or the adopted reference abundances are absent .     as a function of their respective condensation temperatures @xmath29 .",

    "however , ramrez et al . ( 2014 ) surveyed the differential abundances of many solar - type stars and were not able to find a good correlation of these depletions with the presence or absence of planets ; the picture may be muddled by how deep the stars convection zones were at the time when the separations took place and the planetary disks formed .",

    "1996 ; kim & martin 1996 ; mathis 1996 ; dwek 1997 ; li 2005 ) have expressed concerns that the c depletion results indicated that there was an insufficient amount of carbon in solid form to reconcile the observed optical and near - uv extinctions with calculations of the optical properties of dust grains , where the requirements for the fractional amounts of c in solids ranged from @xmath34 parts per million h atoms ( ppm ) ( mathis 1996 ) to 300@xmath1ppm ( draine & lee 1984 ) .",

    "however , sofia et al .",
    "( 2011 ) have measured the damping wings of the 1334@xmath1  allowed transition of c  ii in some spectra instead of the customarily - measured strengths of the very weak intersystem line at 2325@xmath1 .",

    "it is generally true that the @xmath31-values that are calculated for semi - forbidden lines are much less reliable than those for allowed transitions , which may indicate that the new c abundances are more trustworthy .",
    "however , an opposing consideration is the fact that sofia , et al . had to measure damping wings on top of strong stellar c  ii lines , which they had to estimate from calculations of stellar model atmospheres and radiative transfer .      of all 17 elements studied by jenkins ( 2009 )",

    "gail and sedlmayr ( 1986 ) suggested that the condensation of n into any sort of solid compound might be inhibited by the production of @xmath39 which has a saturated bond with a very high activation energy for any gas - phase reactions that could form other molecules .",
    "this may be an attractive theoretical consideration , but the observed abundance of n@xmath2 in the interstellar medium is small ( knauth et al .",
    "2004 , 2006 ) .",
    "a conventional view is that oxygen in dust grains appears in the form of refractory compounds such as silicates and metallic oxides . in this category ,",
    "the elements mg , si , and fe are the only ones with significantly high abundances to be relevant . we can examine whether or not the depletions o with respect to these three elements is consistent with this picture ( again , this allows us to sidestep the uncertainties in the reference abundance of o , which , through the years , has shown large changes from one determination to the next ; see  3.4 of ref ( asplund , et al .",
    "2009 ) for details ) . at @xmath13 , eq .  [ differential_grain_comp ] and the parameters in table  [ parameters ] tell us that @xmath40 , which is consistent with the most oxygen - rich silicate , mgsio@xmath41 where the ratio of o to the other atoms is 1.5 .",
    "however , when @xmath14 the differential consumption of o relative to the other three elements is ten times higher !",
    "even when we consider the @xmath42 uncertainty in @xmath43 , we find that the ratio only drops to 6 times the consumption rate of mg + si + fe .",
    "clearly , in addition to forming silicates or metallic oxides , oxygen must be in bound form with some other element .",
    "we can rule out oxides of nitrogen , because the differential depletion of this element is about zero ( see  [ n ] ) .",
    "water ice seems to be an attractive prospect ; it is known to be abundant in very dense clouds and protostellar nebulae ( van dishoeck 2004 ) , but various surveys of the 3.6@xmath44 m ice band shows a linear trend with visual extinction @xmath45 that extrapolates to zero for @xmath46 ( whittet et al .",

    "complications arise when we recognize that some compounds rely on the presence of others to form initially and remain stable for long periods of time .",

    "<S> ultraviolet spectra of stars recorded by orbiting observatories since the 1970 s have revealed absorption features produced by atoms in their favored ionization stages in the neutral ism of our galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> most elements show abundances relative to hydrogen that are below their values in stars , indicating their removal by condensation into solid form . </S>",
    "<S> the relative amounts of these depletions vary from one location to the next , and different elements show varying degrees of depletion . in a study of abundances along </S>",
    "<S> 243 different sight lines reported in more than 100 papers , jenkins ( 2009 ) characterized the systematic patterns for the depletions of 17 different elements , and these results in turn were used to help us understand the compositions of dust grains . </S>",
    "<S> since the conclusions are based on differential depletions along different sightlines , they are insensitive to errors in the adopted values for the total element abundances </S>",
    "<S> . some of the more remarkable conclusions to emerge from this study are that ( 1 ) oxygen depletions in the denser gas regions ( but not as dense as the interiors of molecular clouds ) are stronger than what we can expect from just the formation of silicates and metallic oxides , and ( 2 ) the chemically inert element krypton shows some evidence for weak depletion , perhaps as a result of trapping within water clathrates or binding with @xmath0 . </S>"
