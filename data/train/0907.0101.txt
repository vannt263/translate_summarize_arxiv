    "+      this example is based on the capability of simulating an entire pulsar population , with the goal of studying the lat sensitivity @xcite or understanding the lat detection ratio between radio - loud and radio - quiet pulsars @xcite .",
    "we have produced large simulations based on a diversified and highly - detailed population built by using evolutionary synthesis codes .",
    "one example of such a population is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6_dc2 ] , where a total of 404 pulsars down to a flux limit of 10@xmath8ph @xmath9s@xmath10 ( e@xmath4100 mev ) was produced starting from the pulsar distribution provided by the population synthesis code described in @xcite .",
    "the population is composed of the 6 egret pulsars and 39 radio pulsars coincident with 3eg sources that were synthesized using the classical polar cap cascade scenario @xcite .",
    "140 pulsars with low altitude slot gap emission @xcite were also simulated , by using a super exponential cutoff according to this model .",
    "103 were found to be fainter in the radio and were classified as radio - quiet , while the others were classified as radio - loud .",
    "the model in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6_dc2 ] includes also 17 radio - loud and 212 radio - quiet millisecond pulsars ( msps ) . according to the polar cap scenario",
    ", msps can produce gamma rays by inverse - compton induced cascades , even if they are below the curvature radiation pair death line @xcite . + in order to estimate the number of pulsars detected with the lat , we run an automatic routine based on the _ fermi _ science tools , obtaining a total of 71 normal pulsars and 61 msps detected in 1 year .",
    "this result , that takes into account the detailed structure of the diffuse gamma - ray background , is compatible with the number of pulsars discovered discovered by _",
    "fermi _ in its first months @xcite .",
    "+ the algorithms in _ pulsarspectrum _   have been optimized to keep simulation times short , and the simulation of large sample of pulsars have been used to estimate the computing time and precision.with a 2 ghz processor the simulation of 200 pulsars for an observation time of 1 month takes nearly two hours . the precision that _ pulsarspectrum _   can achieve has a direct impact on the cpu time . in order to have a good compromise between precision and cpu time , the configuration adopted for pulsarspectrum has an accuracy of 50@xmath15s over the whole timing correction chain .",
    "this precision is considered satisfactory for the purpose of this simulation but can be improved if necessary .      the capability to simulate timing noise , which affects pulsar phase coherence over time ( sec .",
    "[ sec : tnoise ] ) , allows a better understanding of the limits of the blind search for radio quiet pulsars .",
    "the first result of blind searches in the lat data has been the discovery of the cta 1 supernova remnant@xcite .",
    "+ the timing noise produces a distortion in the light curve , as is shown in fig .",

    "right : the same pulsar simulated including timing noise and with phase assignment using only an approximation of @xmath32 , and @xmath62 as in a typical blind search . ]",
    "the left panel shows a simulated pulsar located at cta 1 with @xmath32=100 ms , @xmath62=10@xmath104 s s@xmath10 , and @xmath63=9@xmath105 hz @xmath21 and no timing noise .",
    "the phases have been assigned using the exact values of @xmath32,@xmath62 , and @xmath63 used for the simulation .",
    "the right panel shows a simulation of the same pulsar with timing noise , that has an activity parameter of @xmath1061.89 ( eq . [ eq : tna_pdot ] ) .",
    "the phase assignment has been carried out using approximate values of @xmath32 , and @xmath62 , as they would be obtained from a blind search . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7_noisylc ] a periodic structure is still visible but the significance is smaller , since the h - test statistics ts@xmath107 change from ts@xmath107=209 ( left ) to ts@xmath107=125 ( right ) . + a more detailed set of simulations has been produced to explore how the timing noise rms evolves with time for different activity parameters derived using typical values of @xmath62 and keeping the same pulsar frequency of 10 hz .",
    "we expect that higher activity parameters imply a more rapid increase of the timing noise rms with time , as it is confirmed in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8_rmsvstime ] . an 0.1 ms or 1 ms",
    "rms is compatible with typical rms residuals provided from radio observations .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8_rmsvstime ] that a pulsar with a timing noise activity of 1.9 reaches an rms value of 0.1 ms over few days while the same value is reached in about 2 months for smaller timing noise .",
    "corresponding to different values of activity @xmath76 . ]",
    "the first astronomical sources detected at gamma - ray energies were pulsars , but still many questions about their natures and emission mechanisms remain unanswered .",
    "@xmath0 provides an enormous leap in capability for exploring pulsars and the lat will be able to discover new gamma - ray pulsars , probing their nature with unprecedented detail .",
    "+ simulation is a powerful tool to study the response of the instrument and to check data analysis software . for this reason the lat collaboration has produced a complete simulation package for the lat detector , for different classes of sources and background , and a suite of software tools for analysis of gamma - ray data .",
    "+ _ pulsarspectrum _ , presented in this paper , is a new simulation package specific for gamma - ray pulsars .",
    "it has been demonstrated to be very flexible , accommodating several alternative models , and very accurate , taking into account the main timing effects on the arrival time of the photons .",
    "the motion of the spacecraft in the solar system with relativistic corrections and timing noise due to unpredictable changes in pulsar period and phase have been included .",
    "it has been demonstrated that timing noise introduces a substantial limitation when searching for radio - quiet pulsars .",
    "_ pulsarspectrum _  has been , and will remain a very useful tool during the @xmath0 mission as a way to compare real data with the predictions of different theoretical models .",
    "the @xmath0 lat collaboration acknowledges generous ongoing support from a number of agencies and institutes that have supported both the development and the operation of the lat as well as scientific data analysis .",
