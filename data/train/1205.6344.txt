    "measurements of charm and bottom production are among the most interesting studies of qcd dynamics that have emerged from the analysis of the first lhc data at 7 tev centre - of - mass energy .",
    "the large total cross sections , expected to be of the order of 5 mb ( charm ) and 250 @xmath0b ( bottom ) , have provided abundant data samples already with the @xmath1  pb@xmath2 collected in 2010 .",
    "a precise knowledge of charm and bottom quark cross sections and distributions is important in order to assess the accuracy of qcd calculations , but also as a test of theoretical predictions susceptible of being used to estimate backgrounds to new physics searches .",
    "this is all the more true since , in the past , early experimental measurements of bottom production at the fermilab tevatron seemed to be significantly larger than qcd calculations  @xcite .",
    "it took a while ( see @xcite for a review ) before these discrepancies could be resolved , through improvements in the accuracy of both the experimental measurements  @xcite and the theoretical predictions .",
    "in particular , from the theoretical side , the introduction of the `` fixed order + next - to - leading log '' ( ) framework  @xcite has shown that the discrepancies are largely reduced if a consistent use is made of the fragmentation function information coming from @xmath3 data . from the experimental side ,",
    "the extension of the @xmath4 production measurements to very small transverse momenta  @xcite has demonstrated good agreement with the fixed order qcd calculation  @xcite in a region where theoretical uncertainties due to fragmentation effects have very little relevance .",
    "these successful comparisons notwithstanding , independent checks at a larger centre - of - mass energy and with different measurements are of great interest .",
    "firstly , low-@xmath5 production at the lhc energies probes values of the momentum fraction @xmath6 smaller than at the tevatron , and challenges qcd in a dynamical region where potentially large higher - order corrections need to be resummed .",
    "this is particularly true of production at large rapidity , which pushes @xmath6 of one of the two initial - state partons to values of @xmath7 , and which can be studied by forward detectors like lhcb and the alice muon spectrometer .",
    "secondly , the greater beam energy and the high luminosities of the lhc can push the kinematic reach to much larger transverse momenta , exposing another interesting dynamical regime , where the resummation of logarithms of big ratios ( such as @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , etc . ) may become crucial .    in parallel with the most recent comparisons with tevatron data mentioned above ,",
    "new theoretical tools have become available .",
    "the successful matching of next - to - leading order qcd calculations with parton shower monte carlos ( psmcs ) has led to the @xcite and the @xcite implementations , with matching to  @xcite and to  @xcite , which allow one to obtain predictions for fully exclusive observables while guaranteeing that inclusive quantities retain full nlo accuracy .",
    "predictions can now therefore be evaluated within different frameworks ( see also @xcite for an independent analysis ) and compared among themselves as well as with the data .",
    "the purpose of this paper is threefold .",
    "firstly , we compare theoretical predictions obtained within the ,  and frameworks for realistic observables ( heavy mesons / hadrons , leptons from heavy hadrons , @xmath11 from @xmath4-hadron decays ) .",
    "secondly , we compare these predictions , calculated within the cuts employed by the experimental analyses , with the available data .",
    "thirdly , we provide a detailed public record for predictions that have been transmitted to the experimental community over the past two years , and that have been used in the comparisons with data that are documented in several experimental papers .",
    "in the  framework  @xcite , one matches fixed next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd  @xcite with all - order resummation to next - to - leading log ( nll ) accuracy in the limit where the transverse momentum ( @xmath5 ) of a heavy quark is much larger than its mass ( @xmath12 )  @xcite .",
    "it allows one to calculate predictions for one - particle inclusive distributions of a heavy quark ( or heavy hadron ) , while the degrees of freedom of the other particles in the event are integrated over .",
    "the accuracy of the  calculation can be denoted as being nlo+nll , with the understanding that the logarithms resummed up to next - to - leading accuracy are of the form @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the perimeter of the meaning of the name `` '' is often stretched to denote also the determination , from @xmath3 data  @xcite , of the non - perturbative fragmentation parameters necessary for a successful description of physical differential distributions .    has been used extensively to predict bottom  @xcite and charm  @xcite production data at the tevatron and at rhic  @xcite . in all cases",
    "satisfactory agreement between theory and data was found .",
    "the framework and the parameters employed in those predictions have not been modified since ( except for a more systematic determination of the non - perturbative fragmentation parameters performed in @xcite , which confirmed earlier results ) .    a prediction for a single inclusive distribution ( typically transverse momentum ( @xmath5 ) , rapidity ( @xmath15 ) or pseudorapidity ( @xmath16 ) ) of a particle @xmath17 is obtained within  as a numerical convolution of a perturbative cross section @xmath18 with a non - perturbative fragmentation function @xmath19 and possibly a decay function @xmath20 describing , for instance , the hadron weak decay into a lepton : d_^fonll = d^fonll_q d^np_qh_q g^weak_h_q . the integral of the fragmentation functions @xmath19 , for a given heavy - flavoured hadron @xmath21 , will be called the fragmentation fraction , @xmath22 .",
    "the parameters for @xmath19 are best determined from @xmath3 collisions data , and a systematic survey is given in @xcite .",
    "weak decay spectra @xmath23 and the corresponding branching ratios are similarly extracted from experimental data .",
    "all the  predictions published in this paper , as well as others corresponding to different cuts , input parameters or distributions , can be obtained from a publicly accessible web page  @xcite .      for completeness ,",
    "we summarise here the parameters that we have used in this paper .    for bottom production ,",
    "the functional form chosen for the parametrization of the non perturbative fragmentation function is a kartvelishvili et al .",
    "distribution  @xcite : [ eq : kart ] d^np_bh_b = ( + 1)(+ 2 ) x^(1-x ) .",
    "we choose @xmath24  gev as central value for the bottom quark pole mass , and the range @xmath25  gev for estimating the associated uncertainty . in this work",
    "we adopt the values of the fragmentation parameter @xmath26 obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , namely @xmath27 for @xmath24  gev , @xmath28 for @xmath29  gev and @xmath30 for @xmath31  gev . was used as a central value with @xmath24  gev , together with @xmath32 with @xmath33  gev and @xmath34 with @xmath31  gev ( note that in the text of refs .",
    "@xcite the values for @xmath26 corresponding to @xmath35 and @xmath31  gev are unfortunately inverted , although the numerical results were obtained with the correct ones ) .",
    "the choice made in @xcite corresponded to using a fit to the @xmath36 mellin moment of the @xmath3 data , whereas the values used in this paper correspond to a fit to the @xmath37 moment .",
    "the reason for a different choice is that the @xmath37 moment is more appropriate for describing steeply falling @xmath5 distributions like the ones found at large @xmath5 at the lhc .",
    "one should note , however , that switching from the old parameters set to the new one can be seen to lower the predictions by 5 - 10% at most : it does not affect therefore the good agreement with the data found in the past . ]",
    "these parameters were fitted in @xcite to the lep data relevant to the production of a mixture of @xmath4-hadrons  @xcite .",
    "no data are available for the individual hadrons , for instance @xmath38 or @xmath39 .",
    "one is therefore forced to assume a similar non - perturbative fragmentation for all of them .",
    "this assumption is likely fulfilled to a large extent , with the possible partial exception of @xmath40 production , which however only contributes a minor fraction of the @xmath4-hadron yield .",
    "we shall collectively denote the @xmath4-hadrons by @xmath41 , and assume that each @xmath4 quark eventually produces a @xmath4-hadron , i.e. the fragmentation fraction @xmath42 is equal to one ( and equivalently for the @xmath43 ) .",
    "the function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kart ] ) is normalised to one : when used for a specific state the appropriate fragmentation fraction ( e.g. @xmath44 ) must additionally be provided .    for charm production",
    "the situation is more complex .",
    "on one hand , experimental data are available for individual mesons ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) . on the other , at least partial theoretical understanding exists on the differences and similarities in the fragmentation of a heavy quark into a pseudoscalar ( @xmath50 ) or a vector ( @xmath45 ) mesons ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this understanding can therefore be exploited in order to minimize the number of parameters to be extracted from experimental data . to this aim , in ref .",
    "@xcite the non - perturbative fragmentation functions into different charmed mesons were constructed exclusively in terms of the @xmath51 fragmentation , whose single parameter was extracted from aleph @xmath3 data  @xcite .",
    "the decays of @xmath45 into @xmath50 states was modeled theoretically , and the various branching ratios were extracted from data .",
    "primary @xmath50 production from @xmath52 fragmentation was described in terms of the same non - perturbative parameter fitted to @xmath51 data , though a different functional form , as computed in @xcite , was used .",
    "the detailed results for the non - perturbative fragmentation functions @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are given in eqs .",
    "( 10 ) , ( 9 ) and ( 5 ) of @xcite respectively , and we do not repeat them here for brevity . they depend ( besides the branching ratios of experimental origin ) on a single non - perturbative parameter @xmath56 determined from data .",
    "we used the values @xmath57 with @xmath58  gev , @xmath59 with @xmath60  gev and @xmath61 with @xmath62  gev .",
    "these values also correspond to a @xmath37 fit as detailed in @xcite .",
    "the ` central '  prediction is computed by setting the renormalisation and factorisation scales equal to the transverse mass , @xmath63 : here , @xmath12 and @xmath5 are the heavy",
    "_ quark _ mass and transverse momentum respectively .",
    "the theoretical uncertainty is estimated as a combination of factorisation and renormalisation scale variations , heavy quark mass variation , and uncertainty associated with parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "the three uncertainties will normally be combined in quadrature .    * in order to avoid accidental compensation between the @xmath64 and the @xmath65 dependence of the cross section , which may occur if the two scales are set equal , we compute the scale uncertainty by varying them independently over the range @xmath66 , with the constraint @xmath67 , where @xmath68 . in practice ,",
    "the cross section is evaluated ( using the central mass value and pdf set ) in the seven points ( _ r,_f ) \\{(1,1 ) , ( 0.5,0.5 ) , ( 2,2 ) , ( 0.5,1 ) , ( 1,0.5 ) , ( 2,1 ) , ( 1,2 ) } , and the envelope is taken .",
    "this envelope defines , at each point in the distribution one is considering , the two extremes of d^+_+,scales_-_-,scales * the three mass values @xmath69 , 1.3 and 1.7 gev are used for charm , and @xmath70 , 4.5 and 5 gev for bottom .",
    "non - perturbative parameters are adjusted for each mass to their appropriate value , and the cross section is evaluated setting @xmath71 and with the central pdf set . the envelope is then taken , defining d^+_+,mass_-_-,mass . * the pdf uncertainty , where available , is evaluated ( setting @xmath71 , and the mass equal to the central value ) as suggested by the specific pdf set used ( see e.g. @xcite ) , yielding d^+_+,pdf_-_-,pdf .",

    "=      heavy flavour production has been available for quite some time in nlo+ps ( next - to - leading order plus parton shower ) models , namely in  @xcite and in  @xcite .",
    "these programs , in conjunction with existing parton shower programs , are capable of generating fully exclusive final states , maintaining the next - to - leading order accuracy for inclusive observables .",
    "we remark that , unlike the  approach , these generators resum only a subset of all contributions enhanced by large logarithms of the ratio of the transverse momentum of the heavy quark over its mass .",
    "in particular , the so called gluon splitting and flavour excitation production mechanisms are implemented only at order @xmath72 , i.e. the lowest order contributions to these processes .",
    "in contrast ,  includes for these contributions all terms of order @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "on the other hand , at small and moderate transverse momenta , the nlo+ps approaches are superior to , since they have the same accuracy in this region but , unlike , provide a complete and fully exclusive description of the final state .    in the present comparison , the nlo+ps methods should be viewed as approaches that work at small and moderate energies , and that are bound to fail at some large transverse momentum scale . to some extent ,",
    "the present work helps to assess the range of validity of these approaches .",
    "it should be also kept in mind that the non - perturbative part of the shower that leads to the formation of the @xmath4 hadrons is handled by the parton shower program alone .",
    "the corresponding parameters are tuned using final - state observables reconstructed with particles emerging from the parton shower , but with the hard production cross section of the shower monte carlo , i.e. not that of the next - to - leading order ones used in the nlo+ps methods",
    ". this is in contrast with what is done in , where use is made of a non - perturbative fragmentation function which is fitted to @xmath3 data with a theoretical calculation based on the very same underlying  approach .",
    "we point out that the parameters that control cluster decays in fortran  @xcite ( psplt , cldir , and clsmr ) may be assigned ( depending on the tuning adopted ) specific values for @xmath4-flavoured clusters .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath52-flavoured cluster decays are treated in the same manner as light quark ones .",
    "although one can envisage to relax this constraint , and to introduce and tune parameters relevant to @xmath52-flavoured clusters only , such a possibility is not given in the official  versions , and has not been considered here .      the  formalism has been introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , and aims at a consistent matching between nlo qcd corrections for a given process , and parton showers .",
    "the relevant technical details are given in the quoted references , and we shall omit them here .",
    "we limit ourselves to recall that in the context of  the matching prescription amounts to modifying the short - distance cross sections relevant to the nlo computation , by including the so - called monte carlo ( mc ) subtraction terms , that are responsible for removing any double counting at the nlo .",
    "the mc subtraction terms can be computed in a process - independent manner , but they are still dependent on the particular psmc one adopts for the shower phase . in other words ,",
    "each psmc requires a set of mc subtraction terms , which can be obtained by formally expanding the psmc results to the same order in @xmath75 as the corresponding nlo contribution to the parton - level cross section ( i.e. that of the real - emission matrix elements ) .",
    "furthermore , their structures are such that all non trivial process - specific information is contained in the born matrix elements .",
    "these matrix elements are multiplied by kernels whose analytic forms depend solely on the shower variables used by the psmc to generate the elementary branchings , and on the identities of the partons involved in such branchings .    although ref .",
    "@xcite formulated the solution of nlo+ps matching in general terms , practical applications there and in subsequent papers have been restricted to the choice of fortran  @xcite as psmc . recently , mc subtraction terms have been computed which are relevant to the matching with  @xcite and , for processes that feature only initial - state emissions , with  6.4  @xcite ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite respectively - ordered shower versions ) for a generic process is being achieved in the context of a  ",
    "see http://amcatnlo.cern.ch for more information on this project . ] ) . in the present work ,",
    "the  results have been obtained with fortran  ( v6.520 , which , for the processes considered here , gives results identical to those of v6.510 ) , using the implementation of @xmath76 production presented in ref .",
    "we point out that , although such an implementation technically only requires the mass of the heavy quark to be larger than @xmath77 , the conservative choice has been made of not including @xmath78 production in the public  package .",
    "this is due to the fact that , because of the relative lightness of the charm quark , contributions may be important where a light - parton scattering such as @xmath79 initiates showers that eventually feature a @xmath80 branching .",
    "these kind of contributions are not included in an nlo+ps matched computation , unless the aforementioned branching is the first occurring in a given shower .",
    "although this mechanism is relevant also in the case of @xmath81 production , it is expected to be less important there than in the case of @xmath78 final states .",
    "it is therefore interesting to compare nlo+ps predictions with , which does take correctly into account the contributions discussed above .",
    "the default scale choice for @xmath76 production in  is _ 0 ^ 2=(m_t^2(q)+m_t^2(|q ) ) , m_t^2=p_t^2+m^2 , where @xmath82 is the transverse momentum w.r.t .  the beam line ( note that , in the real - emission contributions to the nlo cross section , the transverse momentum of the @xmath83 is generally not equal to that of the @xmath84 ) .",
    "the  implementation of heavy flavour production is described in detail in ref .",
    "it is now available at the  box website , http://powhegbox.mib.infn.it/. it can be used to generate events with either @xmath85 , @xmath81 or @xmath78 pairs , and it is based upon the heavy flavour production next - to - leading order calculation of refs .",
    "the output is an event file ( in the les houches format  @xcite ) , that can be fed through any shower monte carlo program that complies with the requirements of the les houches interface for user processes ( lhiup ) , like the fortran and c++ versions of  and , in order to generate complete events .",
    "the default scale choice used in this implementation is given by @xmath86 , where @xmath5 is the transverse momentum of the heavy flavour in the underlying born configuration .",
    "this is the structure of the @xmath76 event before the hardest radiation has been generated , as defined in refs .",
    "it is obtained as follows .",
    "one performs a longitudinal boost of the heavy quark pair system such that the system has zero rapidity after the boost , then a transverse boost is performed such that the transverse momentum of the system vanishes , and then the inverse of the initial longitudinal boost is performed .",
    "thus , although the total cross section in corresponds to the nlo result , as in , one can not expect the two generators to yield identical cross sections because of the different scale choice .",
    "has been interfaced to  version 6.4.25 , and  6.510 , keeping always the default values of the parameters in the monte carlo . a non negligible sensitivity to the monte carlo tune",
    "is expected for the observables considered in this work .",
    "an example is given in figure  [ fig : tunes ] , where @xmath87 and @xmath88 production as predicted by  with  is studied for different  tunes in @xmath89 . at large rapidities",
    "the sensitivity to the  tune is similar , if not larger .",
    "a complete study of the tune dependence is outside the scope of the present paper , and all monte carlo results presented in this paper will employ the default tune , unless explicitly stated .",
    "we begin by considering the production of @xmath50 mesons . the  framework and its non - perturbative parameters",
    "are described in section  [ sec : npfrag ] . in the following we concentrate on the production of @xmath87 mesons ( the others being largely similar ) and we use a value of the fragmentation fraction of @xmath90 with . the left plot of fig .",

    "@xcite are also compared to the theoretical prediction , showing a good agreement within the large systematics .",
    "we note that all four theoretical predictions are in fair agreement with each other within the overall uncertainty . the large dependence , in shape as well as overall normalisation , of the monte carlo results on the specific tune , as shown in section  [ sec : powheg ] ,",

    "these differences largely exceed the systematics quoted from the  calculation , in particular if we consider that the sightly bigger uncertainty at large @xmath5 is mostly due to the pdfs , and is therefore entirely correlated among the different predictions",

    "we have presented theoretical predictions for heavy quark cross sections for various observable final states within realistic acceptance cuts . in a number of cases , we compared the predictions of ,  and  with  and/or . these predictions are also compared directly with experimental measurements at the lhc , and this paper is meant to provide a detailed description and a record of these theoretical results .    the curves presented in this article , as well as others directly delivered to the experimental collaborations , were mostly obtained before any data were available .",
    "they have not in the least been influenced by the lhc measurements , and are a direct extension to lhc energy of a framework previously built and validated using lep and tevatron data .",
    "one can note that , while ,  and -based predictions generally agree with each other in the moderate transverse momentum regions , some differences can be observed at large @xmath5 . the small-@xmath5 agreement is expected , as by construction all three frameworks must return the nlo cross section when integrated over the whole phase space , and this result will be dominated by the small-@xmath5 region . at large @xmath5 , instead , differences can arise .",
    "part of them may be due to the monte carlo based approaches only resumming the quasi - collinear logarithms to ` almost ' leading log accuracy rather than next - to - leading one , but this is expected to be a minor effect .",
    "more importantly , non - perturbative fragmentation contributions that had been adjusted to data in  and  are likely not fully appropriate to be used in a matched context where hard gluon radiation to next - to - leading order level is also included .",

    "@xcite , and the theoretical predictions , based on nlo psmcs , shown in that paper .",
    "the agreement between the lhc experimental data we discussed and theoretical predictions is otherwise generally very good .",
    "we summarize the various cross sections reported in this paper in table  [ tab : summary ] and in fig .",
    "[ fig : summary ] .",
    "the comparison of theory and data at small @xmath5 , as well as at large rapidity , does not point to the existence of a new dynamical regime for the production of heavy quarks ( e.g. one dominated by small-@xmath6 effects ) , beyond what can be accounted for by fixed - order nlo calculations .",
    "the measurements at large transverse momentum , furthermore , seem to favour a description based on fonll , underscoring the importance of resumming large logarithms of @xmath8 .",
    "other sets of measurements not discussed in this paper , such as the @xmath157 spectrum and angular correlations of jets containing @xmath4 quarks  @xcite , are consistent with these findings .",
    "some discrepancies with , on the other hand , have been reported recently in a study of angular correlations between @xmath4-hadron pairs  @xcite .",
    "it is important to consider that , while the overall theoretical systematics is typically large , most of it is highly correlated in different measurements and in different kinematic regions .",
    "this is certainly the case of mass , fragmentation and pdf systematics , but it is also true of the scale systematics . when these correlations are taken into account , the agreement with the experimental data is even more remarkable , particularly considering the efforts that were required , during the first 10 years of measurements at the tevatron , to reach such a level of consistency .",
