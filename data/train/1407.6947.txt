    "in this paper we study a problem of homogenization for a discrete crystalline flow . the analysis will be carried over by using the minimizing - movement scheme of almgren , taylor and wang @xcite .",
    "this consists in introducing a time scale @xmath4 , iteratively defining a sequence of sets @xmath5 as minimizers of    @xmath6     + where @xmath7 is a perimeter energy and @xmath8 is a distance - type energy between sets , and @xmath9 is a given initial datum , and subsequently computing a time - continuous limit @xmath10 of @xmath11 as @xmath12 , which defines the desired geometric motion related to the energy  @xmath7 .    in recent papers by braides ,",
    "gelli and novaga @xcite and braides and scilla @xcite , the almgren - taylor - wang approach has been used coupled to a homogenization procedure . in this case the perimeters and the distances depend on a small parameter @xmath13 ( interpreted as a space scale ) , and consequently , after introducing a time scale @xmath4 , the time - discrete motions are the @xmath14 defined iteratively by    @xmath15    the time - continuous limit @xmath10 of @xmath16 then may depend how mutually @xmath13 and @xmath4 tend to @xmath17 ( see braides  @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , if we have a large number of local minimizers then the limit motion will be pinned if @xmath18 suitably fast ( in a sense , we can pass to the limit in @xmath4 first , and then apply the almgren - taylor - wang approach , which clearly gives pinning when the initial data are local minimizers ) . on the contrary ,",
    "if @xmath19 fast enough and @xmath20 @xmath0-converge to a limit perimeter @xmath7 ( which is always the case by compactness ) then the limit @xmath21 will be the evolution related to the limit @xmath7 ( again , in a sense , in this case we can pass to the limit in @xmath13 first ) .",
    "in @xcite the energies @xmath22 are _ inhomogeneous ferromagnetic energies _ defined on subsets @xmath23 , of the form    @xmath24     + ( we use the notation @xmath25 ) where the coefficients @xmath26 equal @xmath27 except for some well - separated periodic square inclusions of size @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",

    "we restrict ourselves to the case @xmath48 ( see fig .  [ fig:0 ] ) ; despite of its simplicity , the choice of this particular geometry will suffice to show new features of the motion .",

    "we first determine the correct scaling for @xmath53 to have that a straight interface may stay on @xmath30-connections . to this end",
