    "presently , the phenomenon of cp non - conservation is one of the key problems from both theoretical and experimental points of views .",
    "the observed cp violation in neutral kaon system @xcite as well as the electric dipole moment ( edm ) of the neutron @xcite severely constrain the sources and strength of cp violation in the underlying model . in the standard model ( sm )",
    "both strong and electroweak interactions violate the cp invariance .",
    "it is a well  known fact that the @xmath0 vacuum @xcite violates the cp invariance , and results in a neutron edm exceeding the present bounds by nine orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "this is the source of the strong cp problem  a cp hierarchy and naturalness problem .    in the supersymmetric ( susy )",
    "extensions of the standard electroweak theory ( sm ) this hierarchy problem still persists .",
    "moreover , there appear novel sources of cp violation coming from the soft supersymmetry breaking mass terms .",
    "though the phases of the soft terms have been shown to relax to cp  conserving points in the minimal model ( mssm ) @xcite , this is not necessarily true in the non  minimal model ( nmssm ) @xcite containing a singlet .",
    "these soft terms contribute to known cp  violating observables @xcite ( edm s and neutral meson mixings ) ; however , they also induce cp violation in the higgs sector@xcite .",
    "in addition to these cp hierarchy problems , in minimal susy model there is another hierarchy problem concerning the higgsino dirac mass parameter ( @xmath1 ) , that is , this mass parameter follows from the superpotential of the model and there is no telling of at what scale ( ranging from @xmath2 to @xmath3 ) it is stabilized .    in a recently proposed model",
    "so called as gluino - axion@xcite the two hierarchy problems , i.e , the strong cp problem and the @xmath1 problem are solved in the context of supersymmetry with a new kind of axion @xcite which couples to the gluino rather than to quarks . in this model",
    "the invariance of the supersymmetric lagrangian and all supersymmetry breaking terms under @xmath4 is guaranteed by promoting the ordinary @xmath1 parameter to a composite operator involving the gauge singlet @xmath5 with unit @xmath6 charge . when the scalar component of the singlet develops vacuum expectation value ( vev ) around the peccei  quinn scale @xmath7 an effective @xmath1 parameter @xmath8 is induced .",
    "besides , the low energy theory is identical to minimal susy model with all sources of soft supersymmetric phases . due to all these abilities of the model of ref",
    ".  12 in solving the hierarchy problems , in the analysis below we will adopt its parameter space .",
    "in this work , we adress the consequences of explicit cp violation on the the radiatively corrected higgs masses and mixings in the framework of the gluino - axion model .",
    "it will be seen that the supersymmetric phases significantly affect the higgs masses and mixings thereby giving new regions in the parameter space ( otherwise excluded ) meeting the recent lep constraints @xcite . as a result of the standart model higgs boson searches at lep , the lower bound on the lightest higgs mass is @xmath9 ( and correspondingly @xmath10)@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "theoretically the lightest higgs boson mass can not exceed @xmath11 for large @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "therefore , from the searches at lep2 , the lower limit on mass of the sm higgs boson excludes the substantial part of the mssm parameter space particularly at small @xmath12 ( @xmath13)@xcite .",
    "it is a well - known fact that , cp is conserved in the higgs sector of the minimal supersymmetric model ( mssm ) at the tree level .",
    "on the other hand , the radiative corrections to the masses of the higgs bosons , dominated by top - quark and top - squark loops , have been found to modify significantly the tree level bound @xcite .",
    "the cp conserving higgs sector has been analyzed by several authors and the radiative corrections which make very important contributions to the higgs masses have been computed by using different approximations such as diagrammatic @xcite and effective potential methods @xcite .",
    "more complete treatment of these results include the complete one - loop on - shell renormalization @xcite , the renormalization group ( rg ) improvement for resumming the leading logarithms@xcite , the iteration of the rg equations to two  loops with the use of the effective potential techniques@xcite and the two loop on - shell renormalization @xcite .    on the other hand , as is indicated in ref .",

    ", the radiatively induced cp violation effects has been studied without @xcite or with @xcite rg improvement . in between these works , the diagrammatic computation of the scalar - pseudoscalar transitions was the the scope of ref .  9 , where the implications of the presence of cp phases in the soft susy breaking sector allowing to the mixing of cp even and cp odd states were discussed .",
    "more recently , the mass matrix of the neutral higgs bosons of the mssm has been calculated with the effective potential method in refs .",
    "10 and 11 from different perspectives .",
    "the detailed analysis of underlying dynamics under study is performed in case of the small splittings between squark mass eigenstates in ref .",
    "10 ; whereas bottom - sbottom contributions are not taken into account in ref .  11 .",
    "additional contributions from the chargino , w and the charged higgs exchange loops were computed in ref .",
    "25 . in ref .",
    "26 , one - loop corrections to the mass matrix of the neutral higgs bosons in the mssm were calculated by using the effective potential method for an arbitrary splitting between squark masses , including the electroweak and gauge couplings and the leading two loop corrections .",
    "although , the earlier works @xcite on the higgs spectrum were based on some approximations , the results are in agreement with the ones presented ref .  26 in the appropriate limit",
    ". more complete treatment of the effective higgs potential in the mssm including the two - loop leading logarithms induced by top - bottom yukawa couplings as well as those associated with qcd corrections by means of rg methods were performed in ref .",
    "27 in which the leading logarithms generated by one - loop gaugino and higgsino quantum effects are also taken into consideration .",
    "we would like to point out that , it is the main purpose of this work to investigate the cp violation capability of the gluino - axion model .",
    "therefore , we limit our analysis to the effective potential with no rg improvement . this accuracy has proven sufficient in obtaining the observable effects of explicit cp violation on the higgs masses and mixings @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we compute the radiatively corrected higgs masses and mixings , taking into account the cp violation effects .",
    "we will base our calculations to those of ref .",
    "11 , by modifying the parameters appropriately in connection with the gluino- axion model .",
    "the main difference with the previous work @xcite springs from the fact that the parameters chosen are specific to the gluino - axion model , namely all the soft mass parameters in this theory are fixed in terms of the @xmath1 parameter .",
    "the organization of this work is as follows : in sec .",
    "2 , starting from the higgs sector structure of the gluino - axion model , we compute the @xmath14 dimensional mass matrix of the higgs scalars in which all the elements are expressed in terms of the parameters of the model under concern . in sec . 3",
    ", we make the numerical analysis for evaluating the masses of the higgs bosons and analyzing the relative strengts of cp - violating and cp - conserving mixings . in sec",
    ". 4 , we conclude the work .",
    "in this section , our starting point will be the description of the basic low - energy structure of the gluino - axion model which contains the sources of explicit cp violation .",
    "the gluino - axion model , is defined by the superpotential @xmath15 where @xmath16 are the quark , lepton and @xmath17 are the higgs superfields respectively .",
    "the model , replaces @xmath1 with the composite operator containing the singlet composite superfield @xmath18 of r=+1 so that the resulting supersymmetric lagrangian and all supersymmetry breaking terms are invariant under @xmath19 @xcite . the pure singlet contribution @xmath20 in @xmath21",
    "is allowed by the symmetries of the model .",
    "the soft terms of the low energy lagrangian in the gluino - axion model are identical to those in the general mssm @xmath22 + h. c. \\big\\}\\nonumber \\\\ & + & m_{h_u}^{2 } |h_u|^{2}+m_{h_d}^{2 } |h_d|^{2}+ \\left(\\mu\\ b h_{u}\\cdot h_{d } + h. c. \\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\big\\{m_{3 } \\tilde{\\lambda}^{a}_{3}\\tilde{\\lambda}^{a}_{3 } + m_2 \\tilde{\\lambda}^{i}_{2}\\tilde{\\lambda}^{i}_{2}+ m_1 \\tilde{\\lambda}_{1 } \\tilde{\\lambda}_{1}+ h. c. \\big\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] except for the fact that the soft masses are all expressed in terms of the @xmath1 parameter through appropriate flavour matrices .",
    "the flavour matrices form the sources of cp violation and intergenerational mixings in the squark sector .",
    "the phases of the trilinear couplings ( @xmath23 ) , the gaugino masses ( @xmath24 ) , and the effective @xmath1parameter @xmath25 are the only phases which can generate cp violation observables . in this formula for the @xmath1 parameter",
    "@xmath26 is the peccei  quinn scale , and",
    "@xmath27 is the effective qcd vacuum angle .",
    "one notes that the vacuum expectation value of the singlet serves for two important purposes for the model under concern : its magnitude determines the scale of supersymmetry breaking and its phase solves the strong cp  problem .    in the following",
    ", we shall calculate the one - loop corrections to the higgs masses and mixings .",
    "in doing this , we will modify the parameters in connection with the gluino - axion model .",
    "as in the cp - conserving case @xcite , among the particles contributing to the one - loop radiative corrections , the dominant ones come from the top quark and top squark loops provided that @xmath28 ( in which case the bottom yukawa coupling is too small to give significant contributions ) .",
    "the yukawa interactions due to scalar - bottom quarks can be significant only for very large @xmath12 values . on the other hand , the contributions of gauginos and higgsinos are already negligible since they couple via weak coupling . in our analysis we restrict ourselves for the case @xmath28 , so that the dominant terms will be given by the top quark and top squark loops , to a good approximation .",
    "therefore , we will not need the full flavour structures in ref .",
    "12 , instead we will need to specify only the top squark sector :    @xmath29 the top squark soft masses : @xmath30 where @xmath31 are real parameters .",
    "@xmath32 the top squark trilinear coupling @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a complex parameter .",
    "other than these soft masses , it is necessary to know the tree level higgs soft masses @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a natural choice as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 are real parameters , and @xmath39 is a complex parameter determining the phase of the @xmath40 parameter . as was analyzed in ref .",
    "11 in detail this phase can be identified with the relative phase of the higgs doublets ; hence , there is no cp violation in higgs sector of ( [ softmssm ] ) at tree level .",
    "after electroweak breaking the higgs doublets in ( [ softmssm ] ) can be expanded as @xmath41 where @xmath42 as usual , and the angle parameter @xmath0 is the misalignment between the two higgs doublets . as in ref .",
    "11 the angle @xmath0 gets embedded into the total cp violation angle @xmath43 $ ] , and we will not elaborate radiative corrections to it @xcite .    as usual , we calculate the higgs masses and their mixings up to one loop accuracy via @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the radiatively corrected higgs potential @xcite . as mentioned before",
    ", we take into account only top quark and top squark loop corrections , which are the dominant ones as long as @xmath28 .",
    "the radiative corrections depend on the stop mass - squared eigenvalues @xmath46 @xmath47 whose splitting @xmath48 will play a key rle in analyzing the results as it depends explicitly on the total cp violation angle @xmath49=\\mbox{arg}[k_t]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 has been defined in ( [ at ] ) .",
    "one here notices that @xmath51 increases as @xmath52 changes from 0 to @xmath53 .",
    "this particularly means that the strength of the radiative corrections are modified as @xmath52 ranges from one cp  conserving point to the next .",
    "we express the ( 3@xmath543 ) dimensional higgs mass  squared matrix @xmath55 in the basis @xmath56 using ( [ doublet ] ) .",
    "the elements of the mass matrix read as below : @xmath57 where the radiative corrections are generically denoted by @xmath58 . in the case of cp - conserving limit",
    "in which cp - even and cp - odd sectors in ( [ massmat ] ) decouple , @xmath59 becomes the radiatively corrected pseudoscalar mass and @xmath60 become the usual one - loop corrections to the cp even scalar mass -squared matrix @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are genuiely generated by the susy cp ",

    ", we will make the numerical analysis for evaluating the masses of the higgs scalars and analyzing the relative strengts of their percentage cp compositions under the effects of susy cp phases . in doing this",
    ", we will first focus on the percentage cp compositions of the lightest higgs boson ( @xmath75 ) , especially its cp  odd composition ( @xmath81 ) , which can offer new opportunities at colliders for observing the higgs boson @xcite .",
    "we will discuss the dependence of the cp odd compositions of @xmath75 on the cp  breaking angle in reference to the previous theoretical @xcite as well as the recent experimental bounds @xcite .",
    "next , we will analyze the masses and the percentage cp compositions of the remaining two heavy scalars ( @xmath77 , @xmath76 ) in the low and high @xmath12 regimes .",
    "using the formulae in the last section , we will now analyze several quantities in a wide range of the parameter space . as a reflecting property of the model ,",
    "all parameters are expressed in terms of the @xmath1 parameter .",
    "since the @xmath1 parameter is already stabilized to the weak scale , as a consequence of the naturalness , all dimensionless quantities are expected to be @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , as a representative point in the parameter space we take    @xmath86    in our analysis , @xmath87 changes from @xmath88 to @xmath89 and @xmath90 from @xmath87 to @xmath91 for each @xmath1 value in the full @xmath52 range .",
    "however , we would like to note that for the values of @xmath92 , it is not possible to find regions in the parameter space satisfying the recent lep constraints @xcite",
    ". moreover , we concentrate on the two specific values of @xmath12 namely @xmath93 and @xmath94 to analyze the behaviour of the higgs masses and mixings in the small and large @xmath12 regimes in detail .    fig .",
    "1 illustrates the dependence of the lightest higgs mass @xmath95 on @xmath52 for @xmath93 ( left panel ) and @xmath94 ( right panel ) .",
    "one immediately observes that @xmath95 increases with @xmath52 for @xmath93 ( left panel ) , whereas it remains nearly constant for @xmath94 ( right panel ) in the @xmath96 $ ] interval . this saturation effect in the higgs mass",
    "can be easily understood by observing that the radiative corrections depend strongly on the stop splitting @xmath51 .",
    "this quantity depends explicitly on @xmath52 such that :    @xmath97    that is , the stop splitting @xmath51 increases with increasing @xmath52 , as @xmath52 changes from 0 to @xmath53 .",
    "this particularly implies that the strength of the radiative corrections modify as @xmath52 changes from one cp - conserving point to the next",
    ". however , ( [ ratio ] ) decreases with increasing @xmath12 .",
    "indeed , it approaches to unity in the large @xmath12 limit .",
    "therefore , the radiative corrections to the lightest higgs mass @xmath95 which are sensitive to variations in @xmath52 are suppressed in large @xmath12 regime . in the light of these observations",

    "1 suggests that , the @xmath52 dependence of @xmath95 around @xmath99 differs from those at other cp - conserving points , in particular for the case of @xmath93 .",
    "that is , the maximal value of the lightest higgs mass @xmath95 occurs at @xmath99 , and then , the radiative corrections reverse their sign as @xmath52 changes from @xmath53 to @xmath100 ( see ( [ light ] ) , ( [ del ] ) ) .",
    "numerically , for @xmath93 , @xmath101 is larger than @xmath102 by @xmath103 due to the enhancements in the radiative corrections as @xmath52 ranges from 0 to @xmath53 .",
