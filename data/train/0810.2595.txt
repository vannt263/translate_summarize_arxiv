    "the discovery of superconductivity up to 56 k in iron - based arsenides @xcite has aroused great interest in the community of condensed matter physics .",

    "<S> we present a systematic study on the physical properties of eufe@xmath0ni@xmath1as@xmath2 ( 0@xmath3__x__@xmath30.2 ) by electrical resistivity , magnetic susceptibility and thermopower measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the undoped compound eufe@xmath2as@xmath2 undergoes a spin - density - wave ( sdw ) transition associated with fe moments at 195 k , followed by antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ordering of eu@xmath4 moments at 20 k. ni doping at the fe site simultaneously suppresses the sdw transition and afm ordering of eu@xmath4 moments . for @xmath50.06 , </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic ordering of eu@xmath4 moments evolves from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic ( fm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the sdw transition is completely suppressed for @xmath50.16 , however , no superconducting transition was observed down to 2 k. the possible origins of the afm - to - fm transition and the absence of superconductivity in eufe@xmath0ni@xmath1as@xmath2 system are discussed . </S>"
