    "ob stars ( @xmath11  m@xmath1 ) play a major role in the chemical and dynamical evolution of galaxies and more generally in the whole process of star formation .",
    "however , despite being a key astrophysical process , the overall process of high - mass star formation is not yet well understood .",
    "observations have revealed that massive stars are born in very obscured regions ( @xmath12  mag ) of cold molecular gas and dust , far away from us ( typically a few kpc ) and within dense stellar clusters ( @xmath13  stars  pc@xmath14 ) .",
    "they also experience short lives ( @xmath15 years ) .",
    "these observational constraints are the main reasons of our limited knowledge of high - mass star formation .",
    "ob stars are also found in binaries and multiple systems within clusters .",
    "the multiplicity of massive stars seems to increase with the primary mass and density of young star clusters ( zinnecker 2003 ) .",
    "clarke & pringle ( 1992 ) suggest that the runaway ob stars ( 10 - 25% of o stars , 2% of b stars ) are ejected from the clusters by binary - binary interactions and that massive stars form in groups of binaries , which are biased toward unit mass ratio .",
    "these elements indicate that the clustering mode is a very likely key property of the formation and evolution of ob stars , which might explain the difficulty to extend the standard accretion theory of low - mass star formation to high - mass stars",
    ". then we might ask whether high - mass stars form in clusters from assemblies of decoupled molecular fragments or from mergers of less massive protostellar cores inside a large , massive infalling cloud ( e.g. padoan et al . 2001 ; bonnell & bate 2002 ) .",
    "a straightforward answer is that the standard collapse - accretion theory with an accretion rate of @xmath16  m@xmath1  yr@xmath17 can not explain the formation of ob stars .",
    "the outward radiative acceleration becomes important for high - mass stars as it is proportional to the luminosity ( @xmath18 ) and will ultimately halt accretion .",
    "the infall accretion rate must then exceed the outflow rate to produce a high - mass star , i.e. the gravity must overcome the radiative pressure . to solve this `` accretion problem '' , it has been suggested that high - mass star formation could proceed either through protostellar mergers ( bonnell & bate 2002 ) or through the collapse of a supersonically turbulent core with a sufficiently large accretion rate ( mckee & tan 2003 ) . in the first scenario , clusters as dense as 10@xmath19  stars  pc@xmath14 are needed .",
    "several starless cores will first collapse to form low- and intermediate - mass protostars , which then fall toward the dense inner regions of the protoclusters , to finally merge in high - mass protostars . in the second scenario",
    ", high - mass protostars will form after the collapse of single , massive cores and grow in mass with accretion rates @xmath20  m@xmath1  yr@xmath17 .",
    "yorke ( 2003 ) suggests that the presence of an accretion disk might reduce the effective luminosity and thus the radiative pressure on the material in the equatorial plane .",
    "the polar component of the outward radiative acceleration would then be greater than its equatorial component .",
    "this would imply 2d accretion via a disk and bipolar outflows along the disk axis .    in the past ten years",
    ", many different searches for young massive stars have been carried out through a large range of observing methods from radio continuum observations of compact ionised regions of gas ( ultra - compact hii regions ) to spectral line ( e.g. ch@xmath21oh , ch@xmath21cn and nh@xmath21 ) observations of hot molecular cores and millimetre / ir continuum observations of embedded ( proto)clusters .",
    "recently , the study of methanol masers have brought new insights in the understanding of high - mass star formation .",
    "these masers are exclusively detected toward massive star - forming clusters ( minier et al . 2003 and reference therein ) and can potentially trace their distribution in the galactic plane . within these ( proto)clusters ,",
    "they generally pinpoint hyper - compact hii regions ( @xmath22  pc in diameter ) , hot molecular cores ( radio - quiet and mm / mir - bright ) and sometimes cold protostellar cores ( ir - quiet and mm - bright ) ( e.g. minier et al . 2004 ; walsh et al . 2003 ) .",
    "this list of objects would define an evolutionary sequence of the early phases of high - mass star - formation , from protostellar cores to hyper - compact hii regions , all being precursors of hii regions .",
    "an exploration of the southern high - mass star - forming regions through methanol masers has been undertaken in 2001 by michael burton s group at the university of new south wales , sydney , australia in collaboration with groups in france ( p. andr ) , uk ( m. thompson ; m. hoare ) , chile ( g. garay ) and italy ( r. cesaroni ) .",
    "this work aims to make a census of the star - forming regions and characterise their chemical and physical properties .",
    "ultimately , this study will provide the community with a large data set on high - mass star - forming regions in the southern sky for the herschel space observatory programmes and alma projects on star formation .",
    "the source sample was originally identified through methanol masers in the galactic plane ( walsh et al .",
    "1998 ; minier et al . 2001 ) , which exclusively trace high - mass star - forming regions ( minier et al . 2003 ) .",
    "a few ultra - compact hii ( uc hii ) regions without methanol masers are also present in the target list ( thompson et al . in prep . ) . in total",
    ", 131 fields at distances from 0.5 to 16 kpc were selected that can be divided in three classes : ( 1 ) fields with a methanol maser ; ( 2 ) fields with a methanol maser and a uc hii region ; ( 3 ) fields with a uc hii region and without methanol maser .",
    "the targets are mainly located in the 1@xmath23 and 4@xmath24 quadrants of the galactic plane .",
    "the observations have been carried out in two phases . in _ a first phase _ , molecular lines and continuum emission surveys were achieved to make a census of all the star - forming clumps and characterise their physical and chemical properties .",
    "star - forming clumps were identified through the emission of dust from mid - ir to millimetre wavelengths . the simba bolometer instrument on sest at 1.2  mm ( @xmath25 resolution )",
    "was used to detect 404 clumps toward the 131 fields in our source sample ( hill et al .",
    "interestingly , 253 secondary clumps were imaged near those associated with the masers and/or the uc hii regions ( see fig . 1 for an example ) . the dust mass was estimated and allowed us to derive the total mass ( @xmath26  m@xmath1 ) of each clump ( see minier et al .",
    "2004 for the analysis method ) .",
    "hill et al . also measured and derived the clump density ( @xmath27  cm@xmath14 ) , radius ( @xmath29  pc ) , visual extinction ( @xmath30  mag ) and surface density ( @xmath31  kg  m@xmath32 ) .",
    "the average mass ( @xmath33  m@xmath1 ) of the secondary clumps only seen in mm is lower than that of the clumps associated with a maser and/or an uc hii region ( @xmath34  m@xmath1 ) .",
    "this might be due to the temperature of 20  k that was assumed for all clumps .",
    "finally , cross - inspection between the simba source sample and the _ msx _ catalogue in mid - ir has revealed that methanol masers and uc hii regions are generally associated with bright mid - ir objects .",
    "however , several methanol maser sites and mm - only sources were found to be coincident with ir dark clouds at 8 @xmath35 m .",
    "these mm - only / ir dark clouds and maser source / ir dark clouds might represent prestellar and cold `` class 0 '' protostellar phases of high - mass star formation .",
    "observations of dust emission at 450 and 850 @xmath35 m ( walsh et al . 2003 ; hill et al . in prep . ) and in mid - ir ( _ msx _ catalogue ) were also analysed to build the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of each clump .",
    "a preliminary method has been proposed by minier et al .",
    "( 2004 ) who estimated the luminosity and temperature of the clump by fitting the sed with grey body functions .",
    "seds of an ir dark cloud and an ir bright clump , both associated with a methanol maser , are given in fig .",
    "the derived luminosities are quite similar ( @xmath13  l@xmath1 ) , which suggest that both clumps host a high - mass ( proto)star given the mass and the size of the clumps . however , the seds do not peak at the same wavelength .",
    "the luminosity integrated over the mm / submm range represents @xmath36 of the total luminosity in the case of ir dark clouds and only @xmath37 in the case of ir bright clumps .",
    "the @xmath6 ratio for ir dark clouds is similar to what andr et al .",
    "( 2000 ) reported for class 0 low - mass protostars .",
    "the ir dark cloud sed is better fitted with a single grey body function with @xmath38  k whilst the ir bright clump sed is fitted with two grey body functions with higher temperature .",
    "the presence of a methanol maser implies that a protostellar object is heating up the medium to allow both radiative maser pumping and evaporation of methanol from the icy mantles of the dust grains ( minier et al . 2003 ) .",
    "consequently , the ir dark clouds with a maser ( i.e. class 0-like protostellar objects ) are probably in an earlier phase of high - mass star formation than the ir bright clumps ( i.e. hot molecular cores or / and uc hii regions ) .    in parallel ,",
    "a molecular line survey was carried out toward a sub - sample of the simba source list ( purcell et al . in prep . ) .",
    "the 22 m atnf / mopra millimetre wave telescope ( @xmath39 resolution ) was used to identify massive young stellar objects in their hot molecular core phase toward 82 sources associated with galactic methanol masers .",
    "many of these sources are at longitudes both observable with northern ( jcmt , iram ) and southern ( atca , apex ) hemisphere telescopes .",
    "observations of these sources in the 3-mm transitions of ch@xmath21cn(5 - 4 ; 6 - 5 ) , hcn , and hco@xmath40/h@xmath41co@xmath40 were obtained .",
    "methyl cyanide emission is detected in 25 sources , of which we could derive the rotational temperatures ( 40 - 200  k ) using rotational diagram analysis .",
    "hcn and hco@xmath40 were detected in 95% of the sources and exhibited signatures of infalling and expanding envelopes .",
    "the _ second phase _ of the observing programme is based on large scale molecular line mapping with the atnf / mopra telescope and on high angular resolution observation with atca and iram - pdbi of the most promising objects ( e.g. fig .",
    "the clumps imaged with simba are identified as protoclusters in which high - mass star formation occurs for the most massive and luminous ones ( minier et al .",
    "the physical characteristics derived from single - dish telescope observations are those of protoclusters of massive young stellar objects .",
    "typical angular resolution @xmath42 was used for the surveys described in _",
    "phase 1_. an order of magnitude lower ( @xmath43 ) is available with the current interferometers at ( sub)millimetre wavelengths ( atca - mm , iram - pdbi , sma ) and with the largest telescopes at mid - ir wavelengths ( gemini , vlt ) .",
    "high angular resolution observations will reveal multiple systems of massive protostars within the clusters , and for the closest objects , these techniques will isolate the individual protostars .    the hot molecular core and methanol maser site , g318.95 - 0.17 ( 2 kpc away ) ,",
    "was observed with the newly upgraded atca at mm wavelengths in the hco@xmath40 , ch@xmath21oh , hcn lines .",
    "it reveals that g318.95 - 0.17 is a source candidate for an embedded massive protostar ( fig .",
    "additional observations of nh@xmath21 toward the simba sources are under progress .",
    "high angular resolution observations in mid - ir and in radio continuum have also been undertaken with timmi2 and gemini ( longmore et al . in prep . ) to study the multiple systems of massive protostars inside each clump and derive their individual sed .",
