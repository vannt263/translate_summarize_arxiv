    "recent observations @xcite strongly support inflation as a correct theory of early universe and structure formation @xcite .",
    "thanks to the precision data different inflationary models can be distinguished based on their predictions for the curvature perturbation spectral index , the amplitude of the primordial gravitational waves and the level of non - gaussianity .",
    "it proved very difficult to obtain an appreciable amount of non - gaussianity in simple models of inflation .",
    "one has to have either multiple field inflationary scenarios or non - trivial sound speed , for a review see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the references therein . specifically , in models of multiple field inflation when the slow - roll conditions are violated temporarily on the field space , one may naively expect that an appreciable amount of non - gaussianities can be produced .",
    "careful examinations in the context of double inflation indicate that this may not be the case @xcite , @xcite .",
    "therefore , it would be interesting to extend these analysis to similar models where non - trivial dynamics such as a sudden change in sound speed during inflation , fields annihilations @xcite , particle creations @xcite and phase transition @xcite happening either during inflation or at the end of inflation @xcite .",
    "in this work we consider a variant of hybrid inflation @xcite , @xcite where the waterfall phase transition happens during early stage of inflation . by tuning the effective mass of the waterfall field",
    ", we arrange that the waterfall phase transition is mild enough such that inflation continues for a long period , say 55 e - foldings @xcite . to bring the effects of phase transition into cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) observational window",
    ", we shall assume that the phase transition happens around first few e - foldings , say first five e - folds .",
    "we follow the dynamics of both fields so our treatment is a two - field inflationary mechanism throughout .",
    "we would like to see , first , whether the entropy perturbations can induce significant amounts of large scale curvature perturbations , and second , whether a significant amount of non - gaussianity can be produced .",
    "these questions @xcite attracted new interest in the literature for the model of standard hybrid inflation where the waterfall phase transition happens very efficiently at the end of inflation . as demonstrated in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite the quantum back - reactions from very small scales inhomogeneities produced during the waterfall phase transition uplift the tachyonic instability and shuts off inflation very efficiently . as a consequence , the large scale curvature perturbations are exponentially suppressed . by the same reasoning",
    ", it seems natural to ask whether this conclusion can be averted if one relaxes the model parameters such that the waterfall phase transition , happening during the early stage of inflation , is not very sharp .",
    "this is one of our main goal in this work which we shall elaborate in details in the subsequent sections .    as a remark , somewhat related to our work here",
    ", there have been many works in the literature concerning curvature perturbations and obtaining non - gaussianities in models where there are local feature during inflation . in @xcite",
    "this was translated into a sudden violation of slow roll condition in a single field model . in @xcite",
    "the starting model is a multiple field scenario , where the power spectrum features are induced from slow - roll violation or phase transition due to other non - inflationary fields .",
    "however , the analysis of curvature perturbations and non - gaussianities in these models are as in single field inflationary models .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ hybrid ]",
    "we present our background and the classical fields equations . in section [ quantum ]",
    "we study the quantum excitations of the waterfall field in details and calculate the power spectrum of the entropy perturbations . in section",
    "[ back - reactions ] we compare the quantum back - reactions and the classical back - reactions and specify the limit where the former can be safely ignored compared to the latter one . in section [ curvature ]",
    "we study the curvature perturbations induced from the entropy perturbations in details . in section [ deltan ]",
    "we use the complementary @xmath2 formalism to calculate the level of non - gaussianity in our model .",
    "conclusion and discussions are given in section [ conclusion ] followed by an appendix describing limiting behaviors of the bessel functions used extensively in our analysis .",
    "as explained above we consider a variant of hybrid inflation model where the waterfall phase transition takes place during inflation .",
    "the potential is @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the conventional inflaton field , @xmath5 is the waterfall field and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are two dimensionless couplings .",
    "the system has a global minimum given by @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "our assumption is that the first period of inflation takes place during @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the initial value of the inflaton field and @xmath12 is the critical value of @xmath4 where the waterfall field becomes instantaneously massless . unlike conventional hybrid inflation , we assume that the waterfall field is not heavy so it can also slowly roll down during the first stage of inflation . for @xmath13 the waterfall becomes tachyonic triggering an instability in the system .",
    "again , unlike standard hybrid inflation , we assume that this phase transition is mild enough such that it will take a long time for the waterfall field to settle down to its global minimum .",
    "this provides the second stage of inflation .",
    "our parameters should be such that the second stage of inflation is long enough say 55 e - foldings or so .",
    "it is well - known that the potential ( [ pot ] ) with the discrete @xmath14 symmetry is plagued with the domain - wall formations at the end of inflation @xcite which are dangerous cosmologically .",
    "to get rid of this problem one has to consider @xmath5 to be a complex scalar field so at the end of inflation cosmic strings are produced which can be safe cosmologically . however , the process of topological defect formation is beyond the scope of this work and we shall proceed with @xmath5 to be real as is customary in many models of hybrid inflation in the literature .",
    "here we study the classical evolutions of background fields @xmath4 and @xmath5 before , during and after the phase transition .",
    "the background space - time metric , as usual , is ds^2 = - dt^2 + a(t)^2 d^2 , where @xmath15 is the scale factor .",

    "however , in order to get accurate enough solutions it is important to consider the running of @xmath26 in our analytical treatments .",
    "we work in the limit where @xmath30 corresponding to a light @xmath4 field .",
    "also since we are interested in a mild phase transition , we take @xmath31 .",
    "this is in contrast to standard hybrid inflation model with a sharp phase transition at the end of inflation where @xmath32 .    to simplify the notation",
    ", we take the critical point as the reference point and define @xmath33 .",

    "<S> we consider a variant of hybrid inflation where the waterfall phase transition happens during inflation . by adjusting the parameters associated with the mass of the waterfall field we arrange that the phase transition is not sharp so inflation can proceed for about 50 - 60 e - folds after the waterfall phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> we show that one can work in the limit where the quantum back - reactions are subdominant compared to the classical back - reactions . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that significant amount of large scale curvature perturbations are induced from the entropy perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> the curvature perturbations spectral index is either blue or red depending on whether the mode of interest leaves the horizon before the phase transition or after the phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> this can have interesting observational consequences on cmb . </S>",
    "<S> the non - gaussianity parameter @xmath0 is calculated to be @xmath1 but much bigger than the slow - roll parameters . </S>"
