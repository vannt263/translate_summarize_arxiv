    "circumstellar disks of gas and dust orbiting young stars are expected to produce three broad classes of planets in radially - segregated zones ( e.g. , kokubo & ida 2002 ) .",
    "the inner disk forms terrestrial ( rocky ) planets because it contains too little solid mass to rapidly accrete giant planet cores .",
    "terrestrial planets form in 10 - 100 million years ( myr ) via collisional agglomeration of moon- to mars - sized planetary embryos and a swarm of 1 - 10@xmath1  km sized planetesimals ( chambers 2004 ; kenyon & bromley 2006 ; raymond et al 2009 ) .    from roughly a few to a few tens of astronomical units ( au ) , giant planet cores grow and accrete gaseous envelopes if the conditions are right . despite their large masses",
    ", gas giants must form within the few million year lifetime of gaseous disks ( haisch et al 2001 ) and be present during the late phases of terrestrial planet growth .",
    "the known extrasolar giant planets have a broad eccentricity distribution ( butler et al 2006 ) that is quantitatively reproduced if dynamical instabilities occurred in 70 - 100% of all observed systems ( chatterjee et al 2008 ; juric & tremaine 2008 ; raymond et al 2010 ) .",
    "the onset of instability may be caused by the changing planet - planet stability criterion as the gas disk dissipates ( iwasaki et al 2001 ) , resonant migration ( adams & laughlin 2003 ) , or chaotic dynamics ( chambers et al 2006 ) , leading to a phase of planet - planet scattering and the removal of one or more planets from the system by collision or hyperbolic ejection ( rasio & ford 1996 ; weidenschilling & marzari 1996 ) .",
    "finally , in the outer regions of planetary systems the growth time scale exceeds the lifetime of the gas disk , and the end point of accretion is a belt of pluto - sized ( and smaller ) bodies ( kenyon & luu 1998 ) .",
    "debris disks trace these icy leftovers of planet formation .",
    "debris disks consist of warm or cold dust observed around older stars , typically at infrared wavelengths ( @xmath2 ) and provide evidence for the existence of planetesimals because the lifetime of observed dust particles under the effects of collisions and radiation pressure is far shorter than the typical stellar age , implying a replenishment via collisional grinding of larger bodies ( e.g. , wyatt 2008 ; krivov 2010 ) .    here",
    "we perform a large ensemble of n - body simulations to model the interactions between the different radial components of planetary systems : formation and survival of terrestrial planets , dynamical evolution and scattering of giant planets , and dust production from collisional grinding . by matching the orbital distribution of the giant planets ,",
    "we infer the characteristics of as - yet undetected terrestrial planets in those same systems .",
    "we calculate the spectral energy distribution of dust in the system by assuming that planetesimal particles represent a population of smaller objects in collisional equilibrium ( as in booth et al 2009 ) .",
    "we then correlate outcomes in the different radial zones and link to two key observational quantities : the orbital properties of giant planets and debris disks .",
    "the reader is referred to raymond et al ( 2011a , b ) for more details .",
    "our initial conditions include @xmath3 in planetary embryos and planetesimals from 0.5 to 4 au , three giant planets on marginally stable orbits from jupiter s orbital distance of 5.2  au out to @xmath410  au ( depending on the masses ) , and an outer 10  au - wide disk of planetesimals containing 50  @xmath5 .",
    "giant planet masses were drawn randomly according to the observed exoplanet mass function ( butler et al 2006 ) @xmath6 for @xmath7 .",
    "each of our 160 fiducial simulations was integrated for 100 - 200 million years using the mercury ( chambers 1999 ) hybrid integrator , paying careful attention to the energy conservation of the integrator .",
    "we post - process the simulations to compute the spectral energy distribution of dust by treating planetesimal particles as aggregates in collisional equilibrium ( dohnanyi 1969 ) to calculate the incident and re - emitted flux ( booth et al 2009 ) . though certainly oversimplified , these initial conditions generically reproduce the predicted state of a planetary system at the time of the dissipation of the gaseous protoplanetary disk",
    ".    we do not include the effects of planetary migration for several reasons .",
    "first , current migration theories fail to reproduce most characteristics of the known exoplanets ( howard et al 2010 ) .",
    "second , the effects of giant planet migration on terrestrial planet formation are thought to be weak(raymond et al 2006 ; mandell et al 2007 ; fogg & nelson 2007 ) compared with the effect of instabilities ( veras & armitage 2006 ) .",
    "finally , dynamical instabilities are thought to occur when the disk is mostly or completely dissipated , _ after _",
    "any migration has occurred such that the imprint of instabilities on the surviving planets should be far more pronounced .",
    "an unstable system evolves as follows ( figure  1 ) . at early times accretion",
    "proceeds in the inner disk , the giant planets gravitationally interact , the outer disk is mostly passive , and the only significant interaction between the components is that the giant planets dynamically clear out nearby small bodies .",
    "the onset of instability causes a punctual increase in the giant planets eccentricities and , depending on the details of the scattering event , the orbit of one or more giant planets intrudes into the inner and/or outer disk .",
    "particles in the vicinity of a scattered giant planet are rapid destabilized to either be ejected from the system or collide with the central star , and this process continues until the instability concludes ( usually with the ejection of one or two giant planets ; e.g. , raymond et al 2010 ) . at this point ,",
    "the surviving small bodies have been shaped by the dynamical instability but their continued evolution is governed by the new dynamical state of the surviving giant planets .",
    "the number and spacing of terrestrial planets that form depends on the eccentricities of the surviving embryos ( if any ) , perturbed both during and after the instability .",
    "these perturbations span a continuous range but the outcome is quantized into a discrete number of terrestrial planets during the accretion process ( levison & agnor 2003 ) .",
    "if perturbations are weak  if the giant planets collide rather than scattering ( or are dynamically stable or low - mass )",
    " then embryos eccentricities remain small and feeding zones narrow and several terrestrial planets form . for stronger giant planet perturbations ,",
    "feeding zones widen and fewer terrestrial planets form , although the total mass in planets tends to decrease because stronger perturbations imply that the giant planets were scattered closer to the terrestrial planet region so more embryos end up on unstable orbits . in systems where embryos radial excursions are comparable to the radial extent of the surviving disk only one planet forms , usually on an excited orbit . in the simulation from figure  1 ,",
    "the lone terrestrial planet did not accrete from a disk of excited embryos but rather was the only planet to _ survive _ the instability .",
    "perturbations during , not after , the instability determined the outcome . the outer disk s evolution is also governed by giant planet perturbations : icy planetesimals that survive the instability are subject to secular forcing that determines the collisional timescale and the rate of dust production .     for terrestrial bodies with @xmath8 and @xmath9",

    "almost all lower - eccentricity ( @xmath15 ) giant planets are in systems with debris disks , but at higher eccentricities the fraction of dusty systems decreases as does the dust brightness itself .",
    "there exist some systems with high - eccentricity giant planets and bright dust emission , in agreement with the detected debris disks in known exoplanet systems ( moro - martin et al 2007 ) . in these cases the dynamical instability tends to be asymmetric and confined to the inner planetary system and",
    "these are therefore not generally good candidates for terrestrial planets , which also agrees with the observed systems ( moro - martin et al 2010 ) .",
    "the outcome of a given system depends critically on the details of the instability , which is determined by the giant planet masses ( raymond et al 2010 ) .",
    "the total terrestrial planet mass also correlates with debris disk brightness ( fig .  3 ; the correlation holds for a range of stellar ages and wavelengths ) .",
    "this correlation exists because the inner and outer planetary system are both subject to the same dynamical environment : the violent instabilities that abort terrestrial planet formation also tend to remove or erode their outer planetesimal disks .",

    "the solar system s faint debris disk would suggest a dust - clearing instability in the system s past .",
    "however , jupiter s low - eccentricity orbit would imply that the instability was weak and that the system may in fact be suitable for terrestrial planets .",
