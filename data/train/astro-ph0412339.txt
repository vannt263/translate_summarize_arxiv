    "the standard density diagnostic of high - temperature plasmas is the intensity ratio @xmath9 of the forbidden to intercombination lines of he - like ions , which falls from its low - density value @xmath10 to zero at a critical density ( where @xmath11 ) that increases from @xmath12 for c to @xmath13 for fe @xcite ( see left panel of fig  1 ) .",

    "however , these levels also decay to the @xmath88 first - excited level with approximately 15% probability , producing lines in the euv and at 11.92   ; when _ that _ level decays to ground , it produces a line in the ultraviolet . as the density increases",
