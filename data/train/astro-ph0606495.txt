    "interstellar hydrides are the building blocks of common molecules . in dense regions ,",
    "unsaturated hydrides represent a critical intermediate step toward the formation of saturated hydrides as well as more complex oxygenated and nitrogenated molecules .",
    "for instance , sio , sin , sis , sic , and other molecules may be produced in large part due to gas - phase reactions with sih @xcite .",
    "but despite the important role that simple hydrides play in astrochemistry , many have never been observed @xcite . in the case of the sih , this may be partly due to the fact that early estimates of the @xmath0-doubling frequencies were highly uncertain .",
    "the @xmath0-doubling frequency of 2940 mhz reported by @xcite has a large ( 10% ) uncertainty due to the extrapolation of results obtained experimentally at high rotational levels to low rotational levels .",
    "approximate calculations by @xcite for the ground - state triplet at 3.0 ghz are in error by more than 150 mhz",
    ". more recent calculations by brown , curl , & evenson ( 1984,1985 ) give the transition frequencies to an accuracy of 3 mhz or @xmath5% .",
    "sih ( also known as silylidyne and silicon hydride ) is isovalent to the ch radical ( methylidyne ) .",
    "the ground electronic state is @xmath6 , with a triplet of @xmath0-doubling @xmath7 transitions near 3000 mhz ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this frequency is inaccessible from most present radio telescopes .",
    "however , the first - excited state ( @xmath8 ) @xmath0-doubling quartet is found at 5.7 ghz ( figure [ fig - levels ] ) , which is tunable at many radio telescopes .    in a recent submillimeter line survey of orion kl ,",
    "@xcite report the first and only tentative detection of interstellar sih .",
    "however , the six hyperfine @xmath9 transitions are blended with strong emission from more common molecules ( so@xmath10 , ch@xmath11cn , and ch@xmath11och@xmath11 ) .",
    "@xcite regard their detection as merely tentative and suggest that an interferometric follow - up may be required to determine whether the detected features are due to sih .",
    "this paper reports on observations of the 5.7 ghz @xmath0-doubling lines of sih in order to attempt to confirm the @xcite result in the centimeter wavelength regime . because the density of molecular line transitions at centimeter wavelengths is much lower than in the submillimeter , detection of the 5.7 ghz lines would conclusively demonstrate that sih is indeed present in orion kl .",
    "an additional motivation was the possibility of being able to determine the frequencies to much better accuracy than the 3 mhz obtained by the laboratory measurements of @xcite .",
    "data were taken in nine sessions from 2006 february 2 to 2006 march 2 with the robert c.  byrd green bank telescope ( gbt ) , operated by nrao .",
    "the telescope was pointed at orion kl ( @xmath12 , j2000 ) .",
    "the large beam ( @xmath13 fwhm ) encompasses nearly 150  k of continuum emission , precluding the use of position switching for calibration .",
    "frequency switching with a switch frequency of 2  mhz was employed .",
    "the gbt spectrometer was used in 9-level mode to observe dual linear polarization in each of four 12.5  mhz spectral windows centered at 5752.5 , 5757.2 , 5766.6 , and 5771.4  mhz ( the frequencies quoted by @xcite ) in the frame @xmath14  kms@xmath15 radio , the velocity of the tentative sih detection by @xcite . each spectral window",
    "was divided into 8192 spectral channels , providing a channel separation of 1.526  khz ( 0.08  kms@xmath15 ) before hanning weighting .",
    "in addition , some data were taken with 50 mhz bandwidths using a switching frequency of 1 mhz .",
    "total time on source was approximately 32 hours .",
    "a narrow interference feature near 5760.8 mhz was seen during the first two days of observations in the second spectral window .",
    "channels containing this feature were flagged , as were the corresponding channels offset by @xmath16  mhz .",
    "no other interference was noted .",
    "data reduction was performed in gbtidl .",
    "a zeroth - order baseline was subtracted from the data .",
    "spectral lines were fit with a gaussian at the center frequency and two negative gaussians constrained to be at the center frequency plus and minus the switch frequency with the same linewidth .",
    "the amplitude of the negative components was fit as a free parameter ; in the limit wherein @xmath17 , the amplitude of the negative components approaches @xmath18 times the amplitude of the positive component . in some ifs it was also necessary to fit a sinusoid to remove baseline ripples .",
    "figure [ fig - overview ] shows an overview of the spectrum of orion kl around 5760 mhz based on 50 minutes of data using a 1 mhz switch frequency .",
    "the h104@xmath19 recombination line dominates the spectrum , with a series of hydrogen recombination lines visible down to @xmath20 .",
    "he104@xmath19 and c104@xmath19 lines are also detected .",
    "figure [ fig - hi ] contains an enlargement of the high - frequency data .",
    "the h149@xmath21 and h176@xmath22 features are clearly visible , and the he149@xmath21 line is detected as well .",
    "the spectral region near 5752.5 mhz ( sih , @xmath23 ) is shown in figure [ fig - if0 ] .",
    "several recombination lines are seen , most prominently h164@xmath1 .",
    "line fit parameters and line identifications are presented in table [ tab - results ] .",
    "a two - component gaussian fit is used for each of the h164@xmath1 and h187@xmath24 lines .",
    "the lower - frequency component of the h164@xmath1 line corresponds to a rather high velocity , but the linewidth suggests that this component is not molecular in origin .",
    "the lower - frequency component of the h187@xmath24 line is poorly determined , most likely due to blending with he164@xmath1 .",
    "the h213@xmath25 line is also poorly fit due to its approximately 2 mhz offset from the h187@xmath24 line ; any error in fitting the latter will result in an incorrect fit of the former .",
    "the quality of these fits may also be affected by possible baseline errors associated with the lack of line - free channels in the frequency - switched spectrum .",
    "no features are seen in the spectral window centered at the other main line ( @xmath26 ) frequency , 5771.4 mhz ( figure [ fig - if1 ] ) .",
    "the spectral region containing the frequencies of the @xmath27 and @xmath28 lines is shown in figure [ fig - ifs23 ] .",
    "the figure shows the combined data from two ifs , since neither if spanned a large enough range of frequency to cover both the bright h104@xmath19 line and its two negatives at plus and minus the switching frequency .",
    "the data from one if have been scaled to produce a continuous spectrum in the region of overlap .",
    "in addition to the h104@xmath19 line , he104@xmath19 , c104@xmath19 and a heavier element 104@xmath19 recombination line are seen .",
    "small ( @xmath29 of peak ) fitting errors exist in the vicinity of the h104@xmath19 line and its negatives , most likely due to the inadequacy of a two - component gaussian model to fit the spectrum . despite the overlap of the high - frequency negative component with the other 104@xmath19 recombination lines , the fits to the latter are not strongly affected owing to the clean negative version at 5767 mhz .",
    "it is possible that there are minor baseline ripples as well , but the paucity of line - free bandwidth in this region makes it difficult to determine the baseline structure to high accuracy .",
