    "the search for structures in the qcd phase diagram , like the first order phase transition line from hadronic to partonic degrees of freedom or the critical endpoint , has become one of the main activities in current and future high - energy heavy - ion experiments @xcite .",
    "the experimental signatures for these structures are the subject of ongoing discussions .",
    "lattice qcd calculations show that in the co - existence region of hadronic and partonic degrees of freedom and in the vicinity of the critical endpoint event - by - event fluctuations of , for example , the strangeness - to - entropy ratio increase significantly @xcite .",
    "thus , a measurement of the energy dependence of a quantity sensitive to this ratio and an observation of a non - monotonic behavior may provide an indication of the location of the critical endpoint .",
    "the na49 experiment at the cern super proton synchrotron ( sps ) analyzed the energy dependence of the ratio of inclusive k@xmath0 and @xmath2 yields in central pb + pb collisions and observed a peak structure at beam energies around 30 - 40@xmath5  gev  @xcite .",
    "this motivated the analysis of event - by - event fluctuations of the ( k@xmath0+k@xmath1)/(@xmath2+@xmath3 ) ( denoted k/@xmath7 )  @xcite , ( p+@xmath4)/(@xmath2+@xmath3 ) ( denoted p/@xmath7 )  @xcite and ( k@xmath0+k@xmath1)/(p+@xmath4 ) ( denoted k / p ) ratios  @xcite as function of the center - of - mass energy by means of the observable @xmath6(see see eqs .",
    "[ eq : sigma],[eq : sdyn ] in section 3.4 ) , which measures the dynamical contribution to the fluctuations of the event - by - event particle ratios .",
    "the k/@xmath7 ratio fluctuations show a continuous increase towards lower collision energies , which is not reproduced by the urqmd model  @xcite , but obtained qualitatively by hsd model calculations  @xcite .",
    "the p/@xmath7 ratio fluctuations as a function of the center - of - mass energy show negative values which indicate strong correlations .",
    "this observation is well reproduced by urqmd model calculations and can be interpreted as the result of the production of nucleon resonances and their decays into pions and protons . the k / p ratio fluctuations exhibit a change of sign at @xmath830@xmath5  gev  beam energy",
    "which is not well understood @xcite . in view of the complex energy dependence of the fluctuations of the three particle ratios an additional study of their collision centrality dependence at the top sps energy",
    "may help to clarify the interpretation . in particular , such an investigation may help to distinguish the contributions of the changing multiplicities and the genuine energy and collision volume dependence of the underlying correlations  @xcite .",
    "the star collaboration at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) also published results on particle - ratio fluctuations  @xcite employing the observable @xmath9  ( eq .  [ eq : sdyn : nudyn ] in section 3.4 ) .",
    "first results from a recent low energy scan in au+au collisions at @xmath10  gev were presented at conferences  @xcite and show a different trend for the energy dependence of k/@xmath7 and k / p fluctuations when compared using the equivalence relation between @xmath9  and @xmath6  ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : sdyn : nudyn ] in section 3.4 ) .",
    "however , acceptance in both rapidity @xmath11 and transverse momentum @xmath12  as well as the selection procedure of collision centrality differ .    in this paper",
    "we address the dependence of event - by - event fluctuations of particle yield ratios on the centrality of pb+pb collisions in a fixed acceptance and at a beam energy of 158@xmath5  gev  @xcite . in section 2",
    "we describe the experimental equipment , in section 3 the analysis procedures .",
    "section 4 presents the experimental results and compares to various proposed multiplicity scaling schemes .",

    "the trajectories of charged particles are reconstructed in four large volume time projection chambers ( tpcs ) .",
    "two of them ( vtpcs ) are placed inside of two superconducting dipole magnets for momentum determination .",
    "two main tpcs ( mtpcs ) are located downstream of the magnets on both sides of the beam .",
    "the performance of the mtpcs is tuned for high precision measurements of the specific energy loss d@xmath13/d@xmath14 , which is the basis for particle identification employed in this analysis ( see section [ sec : dedx ] and @xcite ) . except for the trigger and beam intensity",
    "the experimental conditions in this analysis are the same as described in @xcite .",
    "the pb beam had a typical intensity of 10@xmath15  ions / s .",
    "the minimum bias trigger was derived from a he - cerenkov counter placed behind the target .",
    "only interactions which reduced the beam charge and thus the signal seen by this detector by at least 10% , were accepted .",
    "the trigger cross section thus defined is 5.7  b out of a total inelastic cross section of 7.15  b. the resulting ensemble of 174 k events was divided into centrality classes according to the energy measured in the veto calorimeter ( vcal ) located 26  m downstream from the target .",
    "in order to reject backgound interactions , a valid fit of an event vertex was required and a cut around the known target position was applied .",
    "the contamination by background events remaining after cuts on vertex position and quality amounts to less than 5% for the most peripheral collisions and is negligible for near - central collisions .",
    "the useful acceptance for pions , kaons , and protons is constrained by the needs of particle identification .",
    "the separation power is highest for particles with large track lengths in the mtpcs which limits the analysis to the forward hemisphere in the center - of - mass frame .",
    "the coverage in the azimuthal angle @xmath16 is a function of center - of - mass rapidity @xmath11 and transverse momentum @xmath12 .",
    "the loose and tight sets of track cuts used in the present analysis are given in table  [ tab : cuts ] .",
    "these are identical to those employed previously in na49 analyses of fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "the acceptance is not only determined by the track selection cuts .",

    "the analysis will be applied simultaneously to the centrality dependence reported in this paper and the energy dependence previously published in  @xcite .    in  @xcite it was shown that @xmath6  is expected to have a strong multiplicity dependence and might scale with @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the average numbers of accepted particles of type a and b. as shown in fig .",

    "fluctuations of the p/@xmath7 and k/@xmath7 ratios are consistent with poisson multiplicity scaling , thus suggesting that changing multiplicities rather than varying genuine correlations are the main source of these dependences .",
    "the p/@xmath7 ratio fluctuations also scale with 1/(@xmath29)@xmath38 , supporting the assumption that they originate from production and decay of nucleon resonances .",
    "the k/@xmath7 ratio fluctuations are also compatible with a 1/@xmath39 behavior , suggesting fluctuations of the kaon multiplicity as the main source of the measured energy and centrality dependences .",
    "in contrast , multiplicity scaling can not describe the measurents of k / p fluctuations consistently .",
    "although the centrality dependence of the absolute value of k / p ratio fluctuations exhibits a smooth increase for more peripheral collisions and is compatible with poisson multiplicity scaling , a sign change is observed for the energy dependence .",
