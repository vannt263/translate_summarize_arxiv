    "generating function ( gf ) is a terminology frequently used in combinatorial mathematics as a bridge between discrete mathematics and continuous analysis .",
    "it functions like a clothesline on which we hang up a sequence of numbers for display @xcite .",
    "a gf may have different aliases in different contexts , e.g. partition function in statistical physics @xcite and @xmath2-transform in signal analysis @xcite .",
    "it can be used to find certain characteristics of a sequence like expectation value or standard deviation @xcite .",
    "sometimes that will be much more efficient than a direct evaluation .",
    "there are many ways to construct a gf for a sequence , the simplest of which is using power series . given @xmath3 ( @xmath4 )",
    ", we may construct its gf as @xmath5 note that @xmath6 can take a continous value and @xmath7 is analytic with respect to @xmath6 , which may give us some computational power using techniques of derivation or integration .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii shows how a gf can find the number of distinct ways of assigning @xmath0 identical bosons or fermions to @xmath1 different states .",
    "section iii discusses the gf approach to find the degeneracies of energy levels of a harmonic oscillator and a confined free particle both in higher dimensions . in our discussion",
    ", we follow the notation @xmath8\\,f(t)$ ] used in ref .",
    "@xcite to mean the coefficient of @xmath9 term in the power series expansion of @xmath7 .",
    "for example , we have @xmath8\\,\\mathrm{e}^t=1/{n!}$ ] @xmath10 .",
    "the problem of how many ways there are to distribute @xmath0 identical particles among @xmath1 different states lies at the heart of quantum statistics .",
    "it determines the specific distribution function that identical particles obey , i.e. bose - einstein distribution for bosons and fermi - dirac distribution for fermions .",
    "textbooks generally tackle the problem by a combinatorial method @xcite . here",
    "we show how to solve it by a gf .",
    "pauli s exclusion principle has that a quantum state can accommodate one fermion at most .",
    "this makes the counting problem to be much easier than that of bosons .",
    "the number is simply the binomial coefficient @xmath1 choose @xmath0 : @xmath11    we can do it in another way .",
    "the occupation number for fermions is @xmath12 and @xmath13 only .",
    "we thus associate each state with a gf @xmath14 .",
    "it is obvious that the coefficient of term @xmath15 in the expansion of @xmath16 is exactly the total ways that we can pick out @xmath0 candidates from @xmath1 states : ( @xmath17 )    @xmath18 } f^m ( t ) & = & { [ t^n]}\\,(1+t)^m\\nonumber\\\\   & = & \\frac{1}{n!}\\,{[t^0]}\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^n}{\\mathrm{d}x^n}\\,(1+t)^m\\nonumber\\\\   & = & \\frac{1}{n!}\\,{[t^0]}\\,m(m-1)\\cdots(m - n+1)(1+t)^{m - n}\\nonumber\\\\   & = & \\frac{m!}{n!\\,(m - n)!}\\nonumber\\\\   & = & { m \\choose n}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the gf approach recovers the binomial coefficient @xmath1 choose @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , the approach can be easily adapted to the boson case",
    ".      there can be an arbitrary number of bosons in one quantum state in principle , i.e. the occupation number can be @xmath12,@xmath13,@xmath19,@xmath20 .",
    "it is not easy to figure out a combinatorial method to find the total ways in this case . with the help of gf",
    ", we now associate each quantum state with @xmath21 .",
    "notice that @xmath22 has an explicit form when @xmath6 is within its region of convergence : @xmath23    just as what we have done for fermions , we multiply @xmath1 copies of @xmath22 together . as a result ,",
    "the number of total ways to distribute @xmath0 bosons among @xmath1 different states is just the coefficient of term @xmath15 in the expansion of @xmath24 :    @xmath18 } b^m ( t ) & = & { [ t^n]}\\,\\frac{1}{(1-t)^m}\\nonumber\\\\   & = & \\frac{1}{n!}\\,{[t^0]}\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^n}{\\mathrm{d}t^n}\\,\\frac{1}{(1-t)^m}\\nonumber\\\\   & = & \\frac{1}{n!}\\,{[t^0]}\\,(-m)(-m-1)\\cdots(-m - n+1)\\frac{(-1)^n}{(1-t)^{m+n}}\\nonumber\\\\   & = & \\frac{(n+m-1)!}{n!\\,(m-1)!}\\nonumber\\\\   & = & { n+m-1 \\choose n}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this is exactly the same as what is derived from a combinatorial method @xcite , but we are using techniques from calculus for continuous variables .",
    "the gf approach also has an advantage when the occupation numbers are distributed in some random way , e.g. , @xmath13,@xmath19,@xmath25,@xmath20 .",
    "energy levels are usually quantized in a quantum system . furthermore",
    ", degeneracies often occur in a system with independent degrees of freedom . in this section",
    "we employ the gf to count the degeneracies .",
    "problem of this kind can be formulated as follows .",
    "suppose the system hamiltonian @xmath26 can be written as @xmath27 where the subscripts @xmath28,@xmath29,@xmath30,@xmath20 represent independent degrees of freedom .",
    "suppose further that the energy spectrum of @xmath31 is @xmath32 with degeneracies @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "since the degrees of freedom are independent , the schrdinger equation of the system is separable .",
    "therefore , the energy spectrum of the system hamiltonian @xmath26 consists of all possible sums of @xmath35 .",
    "the degeneracy of a certain energy level @xmath36 is then given by the total number of @xmath1-tuples @xcite @xmath37 that satisfy @xmath38 with @xmath1 being the total number of degrees of freedom .",
    "now we associate each degree of freedom @xmath39 with a gf @xmath40 and multiply them together over all @xmath39 . as a result",
    ", we obtain a polynomial @xcite of @xmath6 , whose coefficients give exactly the degeneracies we want . to be specific , the degeneracy of energy level @xmath36 is given by @xmath41}\\,\\prod_{\\delta}g_{\\delta}(t).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      a harmonic oscillator ( ho ) is not only exactly soluble in both classical and quantum physics , but also of great physical relevance .",
    "for example , the problem of finding the landau levels of an electron in a magnetic field reduces to finding energy levels of an equivalent ho .",
    "a 1d ho has a simple structure of energy spectrum , whose levels are non - degenerate and equally spaced : @xmath42    consider now a 2d homogeneous ho with potential @xmath43 its energy spectrum can be solved in a planar polar coordinate system , noting that @xmath44 .",
    "a much simpler way is to treat the 2d system as two uncoupled 1d hos .",
    "consequently , the energy levels are determined by a couple of integers @xmath45 as @xmath46 where @xmath47 . for a given integer @xmath48",
    ", there correspond @xmath49 different couples of quantum numbers @xmath45 , namely , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath20 , @xmath52 .",
    "the degeneracy of energy level @xmath53 is therefore @xmath54",
    "now we apply the gf approach to find the degeneracy .",
    "subtracting the zero point energy @xmath55 from the spectrum of each 1d ho and setting @xmath56 , we obtain @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "then we associate each 1d ho with a gf @xmath59 which reduces to @xmath60 for @xmath61 . the degeneracy @xmath62 of energy level @xmath63 is therefore given by @xmath64}\\,h_{\\mathrm{1d}}^2(t)\\nonumber\\\\   & = & { [ t^n]}\\,\\frac{1}{(1-t)^2}\\nonumber\\\\   & = & { n+2 - 1 \\choose n}\\nonumber\\\\   & = & n+1,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using result from section ii - b .",
    "we can go further to find the degeneracies of energy levels for a 3d homogeneous ho whose potential is @xmath65 it is straightforward to write down that @xmath66 and the corresponding degeneracy @xmath67}\\,h_{\\mathrm{1d}}^3(t)\\nonumber\\\\   & = & { [ t^n]}\\,\\frac{1}{(1-t)^3}\\nonumber\\\\   & = & { n+3 - 1 \\choose n}\\nonumber\\\\   & = & \\frac12 ( n+1)(n+2).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the sequence of @xmath68 goes like @xmath13,@xmath69,@xmath70,@xmath71,@xmath72,@xmath73,@xmath20 , which is consistent with the results derived by solving in spherical coordinates .",
    "it is not difficult to generalize above to the case of inhomogeneous hos , e.g. @xmath74 .",
    "as long as the ratio @xmath75 is some rational number , we can always find appropriate gfs to calculate the degeneracies of the system energy levels .",
    "consider first a 1d free particle confined to some region of length @xmath78 .",
    "it has non - degenerate energy levels @xcite as @xmath79 in the following , we choose @xmath78 such that @xmath80 for simplicity .",
    "accordingly , the levels @xmath81 have a gf as @xmath82    @xmath83 can be used to find the degeneracies of energy levels of a free particle confined in a square of @xmath84 or even a cube of @xmath85 .",
    "finding the degeneracies in each case ( 1d , 2d and 3d ) is a basic problem in quantum mechanics . in solid state physics @xciteit",
    "is also concerned with the density of states per unit energy @xmath86 . in two dimensions ,",
    "the density of states @xmath87 is independent of the energy @xmath36 , whereas @xmath88 in 1d and @xmath89 in 3d .",
    "textbooks @xcite usually derive the density of states by using a quasi - continuous approximation of the distribution of energy levels in @xmath90-space .",
    "below we use @xmath83 to find the level degeneracies in 2d and 3d .",
    "following eq .",
    "( 9 ) , the degeneracies are @xmath94\\,f_{\\mathrm{1d}}^2(t),\\\\   d_{\\mathrm{3d}}(e ) & = & [ t^e]\\,f_{\\mathrm{1d}}^3(t).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] unfortunately , series like @xmath83 does not have a known explicit sum .",
    "thanks to the advanced math softwares like mathematica , we can use a computer to perform the evaluation .",
    " coefficientlist \" function can extract the coefficients in the expansion of eqs . ( 20 - 22 ) .",
    "then we are able to count the total number of states whose energies fall into the interval @xmath95 $ ] .",
    "table [ degeneracies ] gives a detailed list of number of states within certain energy intervals for a 1d , 2d and 3d free particle , respectively .",
    "the list plots of the number of states are further presented in fig .",
    "[ density plot ] .",
    "there are totally @xmath96 energy intervals and each interval has a length of @xmath97 . since the interval length is far more than the minimum separation between energy levels , the quasi - continuous approximation is valid and the plots will reflect approximately the dependence of density of states on the energy . a comparison between the discrete number of states and the continuous density of states",
    "is made in fig .",
    "[ density plot ] ( depicted as dots and solid lines , respectively ) .",
    "it can be seen that the exact numbers of states derived by a gf approach comply well with @xmath98 , @xmath92 and @xmath89 .",
