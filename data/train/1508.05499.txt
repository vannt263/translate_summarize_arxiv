    "conformational ( or configurational ) entropy is defined by @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the boltzmann constant , and the sum is taken over all structures . as shown experimentally to be the case for calmodulin @xcite , conformational entropy plays an important role for the discrimination observed in protein - ligand binding . since conformational entropy is well - known to be difficult to measure , this recent experimental advance involves using nmr relaxation as a proxy for entropy , a technique reviewed in @xcite .",
    "it is currently not possible to reliably compute the conformational entropy for 3-dimensional molecular structures @xcite ; nevertheless , various methods have been developed , employing approaches from molecular , harmonic , and quasiharmonic dynamics @xcite .",
    "it appears likely that such computational methods will continue to improve , especially with the availability now of experimentally determined values by using nmr relaxation @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the complex situation for 3-dimensional molecular structures , we show here that it is possible to accurately and efficiently compute the exact value of conformational entropy for rna secondary structures , with respect to the turner energy model @xcite , whose free energy parameters are experimentally determined from uv absorption experiments @xcite .",

    "the exact definition of these loops can be found in the description of zuker s algorithm @xcite which computes the minimum free energy ( mfe ) secondary structure with respect to the turner energy model . as explained in @xcite , values for base stacking enthalpy and entropy",
    "can be determined by plotting the experimentally measured uv absorption values of various double - stranded rna oligonucleotide sequences at 280 nm ( also 260 nm ) as a function of rna concentration . by least - squares",

    "it follows that the conformational entropy is equal to the boltzmann constant times the structural entropy : @xmath18 .    before presenting our results and methods",
    ", we first survey several distinct notions of entropy that have appeared in the literature of rna secondary structures  each quite different from the notion of thermodynamic structural entropy described in this paper .",
    "shannon entropy is used to quantify the variability of positions in a multiple sequence alignment .",
    "this application is particularly widespread due to the ubiquitous use of sequence logos @xcite to present motifs in proteins , dna and rna . letting @xmath19 denote the 4-letter alphabet @xmath20 , the pointwise entropy @xmath21 at position @xmath22 in the alignment is defined by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the proportion of nucleotide @xmath25 at position @xmath22 .",

    ". finally , in section  [ section : discussion ] , we describe differences between the methods and discuss the numerical discrepancy between thermodynamic structural entropy values and scfg derivational entropy values . for more background on rna , an excellent , though somewhat outdated , review of computational and physical aspects of rna is given by higgs @xcite .",
    "in this section , we describe the two novel algorithms to compute rna thermodynamic structural entropy using the turner energy model @xcite .",
    "section [ section : statisticalmechanics ] describes the relation between entropy and expected energy , and provides two variants of a simple sampling method to approximate the value of structural entropy .",
    "the approximation does not yield accurate entropy values , so two accurate methods are described : ( 1 ) formal temperature derivative ( ftd ) method , ( 2 ) dynamic programming ( dp ) method .",
    "an overview of both algorithms is provided in this section .",
    "full details of each algorithm are then provided in sections  [ section : statisticalphysics ] and [ section : entropydp ] .",
    "shannon entropy for the boltzmann ensemble of secondary structures of a given rna sequence @xmath28 is defined by @xmath61 \\nonumber \\\\   & = & \\frac{1}{rt } \\sum_s   p(s ) e(s ) + \\frac{\\ln z}{z } \\cdot \\sum_{s } \\exp(-e(s)/rt ) \\nonumber \\\\ & = &   \\frac{\\langle e \\rangle}{rt }   + \\ln z = \\frac{\\langle e \\rangle - g}{rt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 denotes the ensemble free energy @xmath62 .",
    "it follows that if the energy @xmath15 of every structure @xmath7 is zero , or if the temperature @xmath34 is infinite , then entropy is equal to the logarithm of the number of structures .",
    "note as well that in the nussinov energy model @xcite , where each base pair has an energy of @xmath63 , it follows that the expected energy is equal to @xmath63 times the expected number of base pairs , i.e. @xmath64 , where @xmath30 is the probability of base pair @xmath31 in the nussinov model .    by sampling rna structures with the rnasubopt program from vienna rna package @xcite",
    ", we can approximate the value of expected energy , and hence obtain an approximation of the thermodynamic entropy by using equation  ( [ eqn : eqnshannonentropydef ] ) .",
    "this can be done in two distinct manners .    in the first approach",
    ", a user - specified number n of low energy structures from the thermodynamic ensemble can be sampled by using the algorithm of ding and lawrence @xcite , as implemented in rnasubopt -p n. a sampling approximation for the expected energy is then defined to be the arithmetic average of the free energy of the n sampled structures . in the second approach ,",
    "all structures can be generated , whose free energy lies within a user - specified range e of the minimum free energy , by using the algorithm of wuchty @xcite , as implemented in rnasubopt -e e. let @xmath65 be an approximation of the partition function , defined by summing the boltzmann factors @xmath66 for all generated structures .",
    "define the ( approximate ) boltzmann probability of a generated structure @xmath7 to be @xmath67 .",
    "an approximation for the expected energy is in this case taken to be @xmath68 , where the sum is taken over all structures @xmath7 , whose free energy is within e kcal / mol of the minimum free energy . in either case , the resulting entropy approximation is not particularly good .",
    "for instance , the thermodynamic entropy of the 78 nt arginyl - trna from _ aeropyrum pernix _ ( accession code tdbr00000589 in the _ transfer rna database",
    "_ trnadb @xcite ) is 5.44 , as computed by the algorithm rnaentropy described in this paper , while the entropy approximation by the first sampling approach with @xmath69 is 4.71 and that of the second sampling approach with @xmath70 is 4.68 .",
    "since the estimate from each sampling approach has greater than 13% relative error , sampling can not be used to provide accurate entropy values .",
    "for that reason , we now briefly describe two novel , cubic time algorithms to compute the exact value of structural entropy  details of the algorithms are further described in sections  [ section : statisticalphysics ] and [ section : entropydp ] .",
    "it is well - known from statistical physics that the average energy @xmath60 of @xmath71 independent and distinguishable particles is given by the following formula ( cf equation ( 10.36 ) of @xcite ) : @xmath72 this equation does not hold in the case of rna secondary structures with the turner energy model ; however , equation  ( [ eqn : expenergydill ] ) is close to being correct .",
    "the idea of algorithm 1 is to use finite differences @xmath73 to approximate the derivative @xmath74 , thus obtaining the expected energy @xmath60 , from which we obtain the structural entropy by applying equation  ( [ eqn : eqnshannonentropydef ] ) .",
    "as shown later , certain technically subtle issues arise in this approach ; in particular , the derivative @xmath74 must be taken with respect to the _ formal temperature _ , which represents only those occurrences of the temperature variable within the expression @xmath75 .",
    "formal temperature is distinct from _ table temperature _ , which latter designates all occurrences of the temperature variable in the turner energy parameters .",
    "this will be fully explained in section  [ section : statisticalphysics ] .",
    "for this reason , algorithm 1 is named ftd , for formal temperature derivative .",
    "recall that the partition function for a given rna sequence @xmath8 is defined by @xmath76 , where the sum is taken over all secondary structures of @xmath77 .",
    "letting @xmath78 denote the boltzmann factor of @xmath7 , it follows that the boltzmann probality of secondary structure @xmath7 satisfies @xmath79 , and hence @xmath80 where @xmath81 .",
    "the partition function @xmath17 can be computed by mccaskill s algorithm @xcite , while in sections  [ section : entropydp ] , we describe a dynamic programming algorithm to compute @xmath82 . since this method uses dynamic programming , algorithm 2",
    "is named dp .",
    "both ftd and dp support the turner99 and turner04 energy models @xcite , and all references to ftd and dp mean ftd04 and dp04 , unless otherwise stated ( there are small numerical differences in the entropy , depending on the choice of turner parameters ) .",
    "moreover , both algorithms allow the user to specify an arbitrary temperature @xmath34 for the computation of structural entropy .",
    "this latter feature could prove useful in the investigation of thermoswitches , also called rna thermometers , discussed later .",
    "the software rnaentropy implements both algorithms , and is available at http://bioinformatics.bc.edu/clotelab/rnaentropy .",
    "here we show that for the turner energy model of rna secondary structures , expected energy satisfies @xmath83 although equality does not strictly hold . indeed , @xmath84 let _ formal temperature _ denote each occurrence of the temperature variable @xmath34 within the expression @xmath75 , while _ table temperature _ denotes all other occurrences ( i.e. table temperature refers to the temperature - dependent turner free energy parameters @xcite ) .",
    "this will shortly be explained in greater detail . from equation ( [ eqn : expenergystatphysics ] ) , it follows that expected energy @xmath60 is equal to @xmath85 times the derivative of @xmath86 with respect to _ formal temperature _ , which latter we define to be the _ formal temperature derivative _ of @xmath86 .",
    "if we treat the energy @xmath15 of structure @xmath7 as a constant ( computed at either the default temperature of @xmath87 c , or at a user - specified temperature @xmath34 ) , then the second term of equation ( [ eqn : expenergystatphysics2 ] ) disappears , and we can approximate @xmath88 by the finite difference @xmath89 , where for instance @xmath90 .",
    "this requires a modification of mccaskill s algorithm @xcite for the partition function @xmath91 , where we distinguish between _ formal temperature _ and _ table temperature_. our software rnaentropy implements such a modification , and thus supports the formal temperature derivative ( ftd ) method of computing thermodynamic structural entropy .",
    "note that the function @xmath86 is decreasing and concave down , so barring numerical precision errors , the finite difference @xmath73 is negative and slightly larger in absolute value than the formal temperature derivative @xmath74 .",
    "from equation ( [ eqn : eqnshannonentropydef ] ) , structural entropy @xmath16 is equal to @xmath92 and so there will be a small numerical deviation between the value of @xmath16 , computed by the ftd ( formal temperature derivative ) method currently described , and the exact value of @xmath16 computed by the dp ( dynamic programming ) method , described in section  [ section : entropydp ] . in particular , entropy values computed by ftd should be slightly smaller than those computed by dp , where the discrepancy will be visible only for large sequence length .",

    "<S> thermodynamic structural entropy is much smaller than derivational entropy , and the correlation between length - normalized thermodynamic entropy and derivational entropy is moderately weak to poor . in applications , we plot the structural entropy as a function of temperature for known thermoswitches , such as the repression of heat shock gene expression ( rose ) element , we determine that the correlation between hammerhead ribozyme cleavage activity and total free energy is improved by including an additional free energy term arising from conformational entropy , and we plot the structural entropy of windows of the hiv-1 genome .    </S>",
    "<S> our software rnaentropy can compute structural entropy for any user - specified temperature , and supports both the turner99 and turner04 energy parameters . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that rnaentropy is state - of - the - art software to compute rna secondary structure conformational entropy . </S>",
    "<S> the software is available at http://bioinformatics.bc.edu/clotelab/rnaentropy . </S>"
