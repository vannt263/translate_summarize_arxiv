    "one of the most promising and least developed areas of hadron spectroscopy is the excited heavy - light ( hl ) meson .",
    "although at present only a few states of each flavor have been observed future discoveries at @xmath2 factories , cleoc , hera , and hadron colliders will surely change this situation .",
    "in addition to the ordinary @xmath3 states we should observe hybrid and possibly multi - quark confined mesons .",
    "it is important therefore to reliably predict where the standard hl mesons lie and to explore the close relationship between the @xmath4 and @xmath5 families of hl mesons .",
    "a striking observed fact for hl systems is that hyperfine splittings are independent of light quark flavor .",
    "for example @xcite @xmath6 this apparent lack of light quark mass dependence in these differences is certainly not that expected in the popular breit - fermi type semi - relativistic interaction which is proportional to the inverse product of the quark masses ( @xmath7 ) . in the following we show that this is an example of a larger `` universal light quark mass dependence '' ( umd ) ultimately a consequence of relativistic kinematics .",
    "we note in passing that the ratio of the above hyperfine differences does however reflect the inverse ratio of the heavy quark masses .",
    "we start by proposing and supporting the concept that all hl energy eigenstates have the same light quark mass dependence and hence all differences containing the same light flavor are independent of light quark mass .",
    "we take this as an organizing principle to analyze the various hl systems .",
    "in particular we find a functional relation between strange and non - strange light quark masses , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and we predict the spectra for the @xmath0 , and @xmath5 systems . in sec .",
    "ii we establish the umd principle first from experiment , then from a model calculation .",
    "we finally exhibit the umd within a simple potential model . in sec .",
    "iii we use umd to determine the parameters of the relativistic flux tube , a simple but fundamental model .",
    "these parameters are the coulomb constant and the heavy quark masses @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "another application of umd is given in sec.iv where from the measured difference @xmath12 , a relationship between the constituent quark masses @xmath8 and @xmath9 is established .",
    "this relationship is also shown to follow from relativistic kinematics alone . in sec .",
    "v we use our results to predict a range of radially and orbitally excited hl mesons .",
    "the hl meson mass @xmath13 , in the heavy quark limit , can be defined in terms of the excitation energy @xmath14 and the heavy quark mass @xmath15 as @xmath16 as we will demonstrate , the meson mass @xmath13 has universal mass dependence on both the heavy quark mass @xmath15 and the light quark mass @xmath17 .",
    "up to @xmath18 corrections , we may expand @xmath14 as @xmath19 where the coefficient @xmath20 is independent of both the radial number @xmath21 and the angular quantum number @xmath22 .",
    "we expect the expansion to have only even powers of @xmath17 since @xmath17 only appears quadratically in our model hamiltonians .",
    "the energy differences between different hl excitations is then @xmath23 the excitation energy differences of hl mesons with the same light flavor are independent of the quark mass .",
    "we offer three types of evidence for this ( umd ) universality .",
    "we select any convenient @xmath24-wave and @xmath25-wave @xmath26 type meson difference @xcite .",
    "for example , @xmath27 we now compare this with the corresponding @xmath28 difference , @xmath29 if umd is valid , the two differences should be identical .",
    "experimentally they differ by @xmath30 mev which is an accuracy of better than 2% .",
    "other differences involving @xmath31 and @xmath32 give similar results but with slightly larger errors .",
    "the relativistic flux tube ( rft ) ( or qcd string ) model with spinless quarks has been solved numerically for about a decade @xcite . for a rigorous derivation and experimental motivation see @xcite .",
    "we will not discuss the details of this model here except to emphasize that it is a very realistic model incorporating many of the features of qcd .",
    "in addition to the string confinement ( with static tension @xmath33 ) we add a short range interaction @xmath34 . in the heavy quark limit",
    "the heavy quark mass appears additively as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : old3 ] ) with no @xmath18 corrections .",
    "the light quark constituent mass is not well known and we will only assume that it is in the range @xmath35 mev .",
    "the parameters that appear in the rft model are the string tension @xmath33 , the coulomb constant @xmath36 , and the masses of the heavy quark , @xmath15 , and the light quark , @xmath17 .",
    "since the quarks are spinless in this model we will always compare our model predictions to the spin - averaged data .    in this sub - section",
    "we are exploring the properties of the rft model and not comparing to experimental data so the exact values of the parameters are not important .",
    "we use @xmath37 and @xmath38 which are in fact reasonable values , as we discuss in the next section . in fig .  1 we plot the lowest @xmath25 and @xmath24 wave eigenvalues of the excitation energy @xmath14 as a function of the light quark mass @xmath17 . the important thing",
    "to notice is that the difference @xmath39 is quite constant .",
    "this is exactly what is expected under umd as in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : old4 ] ) or  ( [ eq : old5 ] ) .",
    "=      we show here that umd is fundamentally a result of relativistic kinematics .",
    "let us consider a simple time - component vector potential model with relativistic kinematics , @xmath40 where @xmath41 an expression of umd is @xmath42 we can demonstrate this to leading order with the feynman - hellmann theorem @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a system parameter .",
    "the desired quantity ( [ eq : old11 ] ) is then given by @xmath45 expanding about @xmath46 we find from ( [ eq : old9 ] ) that @xmath47 which then yields to leading order @xmath48 the above demonstration of light quark universality also holds for mesons with two light quark mesons .",
    "the next term in the expansion ( [ eq : old14 ] ) is a cross term proportional to @xmath49 , which yields a non - vanishing second derivative ( [ eq : old15 ] ) that violates umd .",
    "a similar violation using the rft model can be seen in fig .  1 and amounts to about 10 mev for @xmath17 increasing from 300 mev to 500 mev .",
    "this accounts for the small observed violation of @xmath50 mev noted in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : old6 ] ) and ( [ eq : old7 ] ) .",
    "as we have noted the parameters entering the rft model are the string tension @xmath33 , the coulomb constant @xmath36 , and the two heavy quark masses @xmath10 and @xmath11",
    ". the predictions for excited states will be nearly independent of the light quark mass value but sensitive to the difference between @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the universal regge slope for both mesons and baryons is @xcite , @xmath51 for a relativistically rotating qcd string , the nambu - goto qcd string @xcite and the rft model predict the regge slope to be @xmath52 which yields the string tension , @xmath53 this value is quite consistent with that obtained from an analysis of heavy onia data alone @xcite and we will assume it in our subsequent work .      without any assumptions about the quark masses , we can find the coulomb constant using umd as an organizing principle .",
    "the idea is to compare the model predictions with an experimental @xmath39 hl mass difference . to do this",
    "we must know the masses of a pair of spin averaged states .",
    "fortunately , we now have a complete set of states for the @xmath28 mesons due to recent @xmath2 factory measurements @xcite and older data @xcite .",
    "we find the spin averaged ( weighted by angular momentum multiplicity ) states to be @xmath54 we need the difference @xmath55 in fig .",
    "2 we show the rft prediction for this difference as a function of the coulomb constant @xmath36 and we see that the correct value is , @xmath56    =      the heavy quark masses do depend on the choice of light quark mass . in order to agree with the observed @xmath57 state we must adjust @xmath15 as @xmath17 is varied .",
    "the results for the charm and bottom quarks are shown in figs .  3 and 4 .",
    "for a given heavy quark , say the @xmath58 , the two ground state mesons @xmath5 and @xmath2 are expected to differ in mass as given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : old5 ] ) since @xmath20 is not zero .",
    "experimentally this difference is @xcite @xmath59 this observation implies a functional relation between the strange and non - strange quark masses . using the values for @xmath33 and @xmath36 in eqs.([eq : old18 ] ) and ( [ eq : old23 ] ) , we exhibit this relation for the rft model in fig .  5 .",
    "we might note that the corresponding charm difference is about 10 mev larger and reflects a larger heavy quark kinetic energy ( _ i.e. _ , a @xmath18 correction ) . finally , we might comment that this relation between quark masses again arises primarily from relativistic kinematics .",
    "the relation @xmath60 follows from the simple hamiltonian ( [ eq : old9 ] ) . with the choice @xmath61 gev@xmath62 as the average square momentum , the implicit relationship of eq .",
    "( [ eq : old25 ] ) parallels that of the more realistic rft nicely and is depicted on fig .  5 by the dashed curve .",
    "we also include the solutions for the light quark constituent masses obtained from analyses of hyperon magnetic moments .",
    "we note that these `` hyperon '' values of the light quark masses fall close to our curve .",
    "now that the parameters of the rft model have been fixed , we can make a range of predictions .",
    "we note that we have required only the @xmath25-wave spin averaged ground states for the charm and bottom states , and one spin averaged @xmath24-wave multiplet ( in our case the @xmath28 ) .",
    "the predictions are then unique and independent of specific choices of the light quark masses . in figs .  6 to 9 we present our predictions for the @xmath4 , and @xmath5 flavor families .",
    "in each case we predict up to five radial and five angular states .",
    "as we expect from umd , the predictions are nearly unique .",
    "if the light quark mass is varied over a 200 mev range , the predictions for the excited states vary by less than 10 mev , which would be difficult to see on the figures . in table 1",
    "we provide the numerical predictions for the spin - averaged states assuming @xmath63 mev and @xmath64 mev .",

    "we have approached the subject of heavy - light meson spectroscopy by introducing a new principle which we call `` universal light quark mass dependence '' ( umd ) .",
    "the idea is that the energies of all orbitally and radially excited states vary in the same way as the light quark mass is varied .",
    "this proposal is supported in sec .",

    "this universality observation makes the analysis of heavy - light mesons transparent and considerably simpler .",

    "it should be noted that our predictions are for the spin - averaged states and that we assumed that the heavy - light assumption is valid .",
    "there are some small discrepancies in the data when thought of in the heavy - light limit .",
    "for example @xmath71 is about 10 percent larger ( 10 mev ) than the corresponding difference @xmath72 .",
    "this is probably due to @xmath18 corrections to heavy quark symmetry .",
