    "effective action written in terms of @xmath6 was proposed @xcite to study the thermal phase transition of the color superconductivity .",
    "then , it was realized that the thermal gluons ( treated in weak - coupling approximation ) turn the second - order transition in the mean - field theory to the first order transition @xcite .",
    "such a weak - coupling study , however , is valid only in extremely high density because the gauge coupling grows for small baryon density .",
    "furthermore , thermal fluctuations of the diquark field become also important as density decreases @xcite .    motivated by this observation",
    ", we carry out monte - carlo simulations of the gl effective action discretized on the lattice .",
    "although the simulation of the gl effective action is not _",
    "ab initio _ calculation and is applicable only near the thermal phase boundary , it has an advantage of making non - perturbative calculation and simultaneously of avoiding the sign problem which is a serious obstacle in direct lattice qcd simulation at finite density .",
    "since the gl action has color su@xmath2(3 ) gauge invariance and the diquark field @xmath6 is a gauge variant object , it is not a trivial task to identify the color superconducting phase in the lattice approach .",
    "we will see below that the eigenvalues of a gauge invariant composite @xmath7 are useful to identify different phases .",
    "( @xmath8 denotes lattice sites . ) also , analyzing the hysteresis loops of such gauge invariant observables , we find the first - order transitions among these phases .",
    "the 3-dimensional ginzburg - landau ( gl ) action in the chiral limit @xcite , which is expected to be universal around the thermal phase boundary , reads @xmath9 with @xmath10 ^ 2   + \\frac{\\lambda_2}{4 } { \\rm tr}(\\varphi^\\dag\\varphi)^2 +   \\frac{\\kappa}{2}{\\rm tr}|d_i\\varphi|^2+\\frac{1}{4}f_{ij}^af^{aij } , \\label{gl}\\ ] ] where we have assumed three massless quarks .",

    "we extend eq.([gl ] ) slightly to _ four dimension _ with two temporal slices and periodic boundary condition .",
    "we do so to define the polyakov loop which can be used as a measure to see if the system is in the deconfinement phase .",
    "this extended 4-d action is expected to give qualitatively the same results as the 3-d action , although the parameters in the former and those in the latter ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) are related in a non - trivial way by the renormalization from the temporal field - fluctuations .",
    "the gl action in eq.([gl ] ) is similar to the gauged higgs model which is studied in the context of the electroweak phase transition .",

    ", it has been shown that the thermal fluctuation of gauge field dominates over the diquark fluctuation , and can be incorporated as a gaussian fluctuation around the mean - field @xcite . as a result , the phase transition turns into _ first order _ , which is similar to the situation in type i metallic superconductor @xcite .",

    "furthermore , with certain parameter region , we observe successive transitions , normal@xmath32sc@xmath3cfl , as temperature decreases from above .",
    "since @xmath22 is realized in the weak - coupling limit , such successive transitions may take place in high density qcd in the chiral limit .",
