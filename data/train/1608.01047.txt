    "quantum tunneling has been of continuing interest since the advent of quantum mechanics , and the inversion of an ammonia molecule and proton tunneling are well - known examples of microscopic quantum tunneling which may be described by one - dimensional models ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . for an one - dimensional symmetric double - well potential of two wells",
    "being sufficiently separated and deep , the lower energy eigenvalues are closely bunched in pairs , to give rise to tunneling dynamics for a wave packet initially localized in one of the wells with the energy of approximately one of the eigenvalues ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "it has then been well - known that , upon adding a small asymmetry to a symmetric potential , the two states that started out as tunneling states in the symmetric case correspond increasingly to states localized in one well or the other , to quench the tunneling motion @xcite .",
    "further , it is known that , for an asymmetric potential , if there exist two states which are almost degenerate then tunneling dynamics take place for a localized wave packet made up of those states @xcite , and the analytic expression for the energy splitting between the states is given in ref .  @xcite .",
    "in addition to microscopic quantum tunneling , a recent breakthrough makes it possible to realize macroscopic quantum tunneling in a superconducting quantum interference device with josephson junctions where numerous microscopic degrees of freedom are tied together to form a collective dynamical variable ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , and , for the system of the transmon hamiltonian of a cosine potential , the analytic expression for the energy splitting between the nearly degenerate even and odd eigenstates is given when the amplitude of the potential is large @xcite .",
    "in obtaining the expression for the splitting @xcite that could exactly reproduce the rigorous mathematical expression for the widths of the low - lying energy bands of the associated mathieu equation ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , a wkb wave function is normalized to be matched in a forbidden region of one of the wells onto a normalized eigenfunction of an harmonic oscillator centered at the minimum of the well ; this normalization corrects the underestimate for a low - lying state that the method described in ref",

    "then , the tight bonding approximation for a periodic system is applied based on the normalized wkb wave functions @xcite . for an asymmetric double - well potential , while the analytic expression for the energy splitting between pairwise degenerate left and right states is succinctly given in ref .",
    "@xcite , before applying the lifshitz - herring approximation for the expression , it is necessary to normalize the wkb wave function by matching it onto a normalized eigenfunction of a harmonic oscillator in a forbidden region between the wells @xcite .    instead of using an approximation with the normalized wkb functions , by assuming that the two wells are parabolic with an angular frequency @xmath0 , dekker in ref .",
    "@xcite first shows that the consistency condition which comes from that a wkb function should match onto the exact solutions on both sides of the potential barrier determines the energy splitting between the pair of the lowest eigenvalues , when a small bias is added to a symmetric double - well potential .",
    "further , he shows , if the bias increases , the ground state becomes almost localized in the deeper of the two wells , implying that the tunneling motion is quenched . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a similar analysis is carried out for the pairs of the low - lying states of an asymmetric potential assuming that the difference of the minima is close to a multiple of @xmath1 . indeed , in the region where the potential is quadratic(parabolic )",
    ", the exact wave function is described by the parabolic cylinder function , and thus the wave function in its asymptotic expansion could have an additional leading term aside from that of a hermite - gaussian wave function of a harmonic oscillator @xcite , which makes dekker s method work .    in this article",
    ", we will consider an asymmetric double - well potential for which the separation between the two wells is large , assuming that the two wells are parabolic with angular frequencies @xmath2 and @xmath3 around the minima of the left - hand and right - hand wells , respectively . in the case that there exist two almost degenerate eigenstates , through the systematic application of dekker s method , we arrive at a quantization condition for the eigenvalues which is a refined version of that found in a semiclassical analysis without the assumption of parabolicity @xcite .",
    "we further analyze this quantization condition , to find the energy splitting formula given in ref .",
    "@xcite . for a low - lying non - degenerate eigenstate , however ,",
    "as a leading term in the asymptotic expansion of the wave function is dominant over that of the hermite - gaussian wave function in one of the wells , we only have an equation which shows that the eigenstate has negligible magnitude in the well and is primarily localized in the other .",
