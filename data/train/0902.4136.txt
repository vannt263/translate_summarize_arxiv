    "the solar corona is often populated by peculiar objects , dense clouds of cold plasma inexplicably floating tens of thousands of kilometres above the photosphere .",
    "such objects are routinely seen during solar eclipses , when they can be easily distinguished by their red glow , but they can also be unveiled with the help of filters , such as h@xmath1 , devised to observe the chromosphere ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . to put it in simple words , these objects ( usually called prominences or filaments ) are like chunks of chromospheric gas defying the downward pull of gravity and staying in a place higher than the one that apparently corresponds to their large density .",
    "this is not the only enigma around solar prominences .",
    "in contrast with the mk temperature of the surrounding corona , prominences remain at a comparatively cool 10,000  k , which prompts one to ask what prevents the mechanisms that heat the corona from also raising the temperature of prominences and consequently dispersing them . other pieces of the prominence puzzle concern their beginning and end : first , one may wonder not just how prominences form but also why they are born in an adverse environment .",
    "second , despite their internal dynamics , prominences that have been stable and healthy for weeks suddenly die in an spectacular eruption .",
    "hence , like all living beings these creatures are born , grow , ( do not reproduce ) and die , but unlike many living beings the processes shaping the lifetime of prominences are largely unknown .",
    "nevertheless , the intervention of a decisive element is quite clear : the magnetic field , that is central to all the mentioned processes .",
    "the reason of our limited insight into the nature of prominences probably has three causes @xcite : there is no such thing as a canonical prominence , but a wide range of parameters is observed in different objects ; no prominence has a uniform structure , but they are made of thin threads ( or fibrils ) and , in addition , different parameter values can be detected in different parts of a prominence ; and no structure is really isolated , so it is necessary to understand the physics of the prominence - corona interface , the effect of the coronal radiation field ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and to trace the magnetic fields permeating the prominence to their origin at the sun s surface ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "our knowledge about prominences has been well reviewed by @xcite , where ample information on the topic can be found .",
    "one of the first studies about prominence oscillations was carried out by @xcite , who noted that in a sample of 68 non - active region prominences , 31% of the objects presented no significant velocity change along the line - of - sight , 28% showed apparently random line - of - sight velocity variations and 41% presented a definite oscillatory behaviour .",
    "similar results were obtained for a set of 45 active region prominences .",
    "there are several reasons that may lead to the absence of periodic variations in some prominences , e.g. the velocity amplitude or its projection along the line - of - sight are too small to stand above the instrumental noise level ; or the prominence material does not actually oscillate at the time the observations are performed ; or the light emitted or absorbed by various plasma elements along the line - of - sight and having different oscillatory properties results in a noisy signal .",
    "after this leading work the subject of prominence oscillations remained dormant for about 15 years and revived in the 1980s , when a great amount of observations about prominence oscillations started being collected .    according to the oscillatory amplitude ,",
    "these events have been classified into two groups @xcite :    * _ large amplitude oscillations _ , that arise when the whole prominence is shaken by a moreton wave @xcite impinging on it @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the prominence gas undergoes a large displacement from its equilibrium position and the prominence as a whole vibrates with considerable velocity amplitude ( of the order of 20  km  s@xmath0 or higher ) .",
    "these phenomena are reviewed in a separate work of this volume ( tripathi et al .",
    "* _ small amplitude oscillations _ , with velocity amplitudes much smaller than those of large amplitude oscillations have also been frequently observed .",
    "the detected peak velocity ranges from the noise level ( down to 0.1 km  s@xmath0 in some cases ) to 23  km  s@xmath0 , although larger values have also been reported @xcite .",
    "a distinguishing property of small amplitude oscillations , which gives them a distinction from large amplitude ones , is that they seldom influence the entire prominence .",
    "thus , when spectrographic observations are carried out with a slit it is usually found that only a few consecutive points along the slit present time variations with a definite period , while all other points lack any kind of periodicity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite made a comprehensive study of the two - dimensional spatial distribution of doppler velocity oscillations in a very large polar crown prominence and showed that , in their particular observation , oscillations are concentrated in a restricted area ( 54,000 @xmath2 40,000 km in size ) .",
    "both propagating waves and standing oscillations are detected in this region and their wavelength and phase speed are determined .",
    "using hinode sot observations of a quiescent prominence , @xcite also report on oscillations that do not affect the whole prominence body .",
    "these oscillations have periods from 20 to 40 minutes and typically last for only one or two cycles .",
    "they correspond to waves propagating vertically along threads with a projected phase speed of @xmath3 km s@xmath0 .",
    "it has been mentioned that solar prominences are constituted by many thin , parallel magnetic threads filled with cold plasma , and as a consequence the dynamics of these components can form the basis of the dynamics of small amplitude oscillations .",
    "early works @xcite already noted the possible link between small amplitude prominence oscillations and the fibril structure .",
    "unfortunately , the spatial resolution of the data analysed by @xcite is not good enough to distinguish the prominence threads .",
    "it was necessary , hence , to wait until the advent of telescopes with much better spatial resolution to have observations in which the prominence fine structure is well resolved @xcite . in the analysis of the doppler velocity in two threads belonging to the same filament , @xcite finds a clear sign of propagating waves and determines their period , wavelength and phase speed .",
    "this study is followed by a much more profound one in which the two - dimensional motions and doppler shifts of 328 features ( or `` blobs '' ) of different threads are examined .",
    "these features are observed to flow along the filament axis while oscillating at the same time . to simplify the examination of oscillations , @xcite computed average doppler signals for each fibril and found that groups of adjacent threads oscillate in phase with the same period .",
    "this has two consequences : first , since the periodicity is outstanding in the averaged signal for each thread , the wavelength of oscillations is larger than the length of the thread .",
    "second , fibrils have a tendency to vibrate bodily , in groups , rather than independently .",
    "h@xmath1 observations conducted with the swedish 1-m solar telescope by @xcite lead to similar results concerning the collective dynamics of fibrils , although propagating doppler velocity signals with various periods and wavelengths in other threads of the same filament are also detected .",
    "all these observations seem to indicate that prominence fibrils sometimes support collective oscillations and sometimes oscillate on their own .",
    "this topic deserves a more detailed observational study and , given the simplicity of fibrils compared to the full filament structure , theoretical investigations can give rise to fruitful comparisons with observations .    during the 1980s some observational works , e.g. those by @xcite , provided evidence about a temporal decrease of the oscillatory amplitude , which suggests that prominence oscillations are attenuated in time .",
    "a very clear example of this phenomenon can also be found in figure 5a of @xcite . here the integrated line intensity of the he d@xmath4 line displays oscillations with a period around 25 min and with an amplitude that decreases in time .",
    "these oscillations are present for a few cycles but , unfortunately , a precise value of the attenuation rate is not computed in this case ( figure  3 of * ? ? ?",
    "* also presents similar results , although with a much better spatial and temporal resolution ) .",
    "more detailed observational analyses of damped prominence oscillations can be found in @xcite , who studied the spatial and temporal features of doppler velocity oscillations in limb prominences . in the second of these works ,",
    "already mentioned before , a sinusoidal function multiplied by a factor @xmath5 is fitted to the doppler series , which allowed these authors to obtain values of the damping time , @xmath6 , which are usually between 1 and 3 times the corresponding oscillatory period . in spite of the lack of similar studies",
    ", the existing evidence suggests that small - amplitude oscillations in prominences are excited locally and are damped in a few periods by an unknown mechanism .",
    "many previous observational and theoretical results on prominence oscillations have been reviewed by e.g. @xcite , so our purpose here is to extend these review works by summarising other papers not discussed by these authors .",
    "thus , we describe the first seismological analysis of prominence oscillations ( section  [ seismology ] ) and the theoretical studies on the attenuation of small amplitude oscillations ( sections  [ leakage ] , [ nonideal ] and [ resabs ] ) .",
    "the plausible theoretical explanations of this effect are reviewed here and the relevance of different mechanisms is assessed on the basis of the ratio of the damping time to the period ( @xmath7 ) , that must be in the range 110 to agree with the observational results .",
    "works that invoke wave leakage from the prominence as the cause for the observed damping are described in section  [ leakage ] , attenuation caused by non - ideal effects is discussed in section  [ nonideal ] and wave damping by resonant absorption is presented in section  [ resabs ] . finally , section  [ conclusions ] contains the concluding remarks .",
    "observations with the hinode solar optical telescope by @xcite display an active region prominence composed of many fine horizontal threads that oscillate independently in the vertical direction as they move along a path parallel to the photosphere .",
    "six different threads are studied and in each of them several points are considered .",
    "all points in each thread are found to oscillate in phase .",
    "the relevant parameters for a seismological analysis of these events are flow velocities in the range 1546 km s@xmath0 , oscillatory periods in the range 135250 s and thread lengths in the range 170016,000 km .",
    "a prominence thread is a cold plasma condensation that occupies a segment of a much longer magnetic tube . in the present case",
    "it is not easy to directly measure the length of such magnetic tubes , although @xcite estimate that the wavelength of the oscillations is at least 250,000 km and so the minimum length of the magnetic tubes is 125,000 km . @xcite",
    "provide another estimation of this quantity , which they argue must be at least 100,000 km .",
    "these authors perform an independent seismological study of the six events by assuming that the thread is a dense plasma moving along a horizontal and straight magnetic tube which is tied to the dense photosphere at its ends .",
    "additionally the low-@xmath8 and linear approximations are also imposed . for each thread",
    "three different studies are done ; in increasing order of complexity they are : ( a ) thin tube approximation and no flow ; ( b ) thin tube approximation and flow ; and ( c ) full ideal mhd equations with flow .",
    "while the thin tube approximation is well supported by the thinness of the threads compared to their length , ignoring the effect of the flow does not seem a good idea because the detected flow velocities are rather large .",
    "nevertheless , as we describe below the results prove just the contrary .    in the absence of flow ,",
    "case ( a ) , transverse motions of the kind observed by @xcite can only be produced by the kink mode @xcite .",
    "the dispersion relation of the kink mode in a magnetic tube containing prominence material can be deduced from equation  ( 27 ) of @xcite .",
    "@xcite conclude that , if no assumptions about the magnetic field , density and magnetic tube length ( @xmath9 ) are made , then this dispersion relation contains too many unknowns and can not be uniquely solved .",
    "but if a value of @xmath9 is assumed ( with the restriction @xmath10 km from observations ) , then a dependence of the prominence versus the coronal alfvn speed can be obtained .",
    "figure  [ dr_hinode ] displays such a dependence for two of the six threads and several magnetic tube lengths .",
    "this figure shows that , unless the ratio of prominence to coronal density is unrealistically low ( e.g. below 50 ) , the alfvn speed in the thread reaches a minimum value that is not modified by that density ratio .",
    "this lower limit of @xmath11 is around 120 km s@xmath0 for thread # 6 and lies between 200 and 350 km s@xmath0 for the other five threads .    to test the validity of this seismological result ,",
    "@xcite consider case ( b ) , which involves solving a simple partial differential equation .",
    "their numerical simulations of a thread that moves bodily along the magnetic tube yield in - phase oscillations of the whole thread , so a kink - like behaviour is recovered even in the presence of flow .",
    "these results are in excellent agreement with the observations of @xcite . perhaps surprisingly , for all six threads",
    "the period is only slightly smaller than that of case ( a ) , the difference being below 5% , i.e. smaller than the error bars of observations ( of the order of or larger than 6.8% ) .",
    "hence , the period of these transverse oscillations is almost insensitive to the thread flowing motions .",
    "finally , @xcite also investigate case ( c ) and recover the results of case ( b ) , which implies that the thin tube approximation is quite reasonable , as expected .",
    "after these two studies the lower bounds for the alfvn speed derived from case ( a ) are firmly established and although this investigation does not lead to particular values of physical parameters , such alfvn speeds agree with the intense magnetic fields and large densities usually found in active region prominences .",
    "wave leakage is a common phenomenon by which the energy imparted by a disturbance to a given structure ( e.g. a coronal loop or a solar prominence ) is not confined as standing oscillations of the structure , which emits waves carrying energy into the external medium .",
    "this situation has been studied at length in relation with coronal loop oscillations ; see @xcite and references therein .",
    "most of the works described in this section make no mention of wave leakage , but our interpretation is that the obtained attenuation of oscillations is simply a consequence of the emission of waves from the prominence into the corona .      in the celebrated model of @xcite a prominence",
    "is treated as a horizontal line current suspended in the corona .",
    "such an approximation is justified by the fact that if the prominence plasma is supported against gravity by the lorentz force , then a current runs along the filament . in this work",
    "the photosphere is substituted by a rigid , perfectly conducting plane with a surface current distribution caused by the coronal magnetic field generated by the filament current .",
    "such induced currents in turn give rise to a coronal magnetic field whose effect on the prominence is to provide the lifting force necessary to counteract gravity . the full magnetic field arrangement in the corona",
    "is determined by both the line current and the photospheric currents and can be of two types : either of normal polarity ( np ) or of inverse polarity ( ip ) ; see @xcite for more details .",
    "this magnetic configuration was used by @xcite to study the oscillations of a filament .",
    "it is worth to remark that in these works the prominence is treated as an infinitely thin and long line , so that it has no internal structure , although the interplay of the filament current with the surrounding magnetic arcade and photosphere is taken into account .",
    "in addition , both np and ip structures were considered ; see figure  [ fig_np_ip ] , in which the poloidal magnetic field is displayed ( the toroidal magnetic field component being zero ) .",
    "the fundamental ingredient of these papers is that if a disturbance causes a displacement of the whole line current , that remains parallel to the photosphere during its motion , then the coronal magnetic field is reshaped and the photospheric surface current is modified .",
    "this , in turn , influences the magnetic force acting on the filament current .",
    "such a force can either strengthen the initial perturbation , so that the original equilibrium is unstable , or diminish it , so that the system is stable against the initial disturbance .",
    "this simple description becomes more complicated when one takes into account that perturbations travel at a finite speed ( namely the alfvn velocity ) which causes time delays in the communication between the line current and the photosphere .",
    "@xcite investigated the effect of these time delays on the filament dynamics .    exponentially growing or decaying solutions",
    "were found both for np and ip prominence models ; see figure  4 of @xcite and figure  5 of @xcite as examples .",
    "an important conclusion that can be extracted here is that the attenuation is very efficient for many parameter values , and consequently the ratio of the damping time to the period is between 1 and 10 ( i.e. in agreement with observations ) .",
    "this point is well illustrated by figure  [ fig_leakage]a , in which the quality factor is depicted as a function of the alfvn speed .",
    "different curves in this diagram correspond to different sets of parameters , with solid and dashed lines used to distinguish between ip and np configurations .",
    "all the ip curves and one of the np curves in this figure take values below @xmath12 , equivalent to @xmath13 , which is an indication of the efficiency of the damping of oscillations .      an ip magnetic configuration similar",
    "to that used by @xcite was taken by @xcite , although in this study the prominence is not infinitely thin and instead is represented by a current - carrying cylinder .",
    "@xcite carried out numerical simulations of the isothermal magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) equations and this implies that the equilibrium temperature is set to a constant value ( @xmath14 k ) everywhere .",
    "the authors mention that , despite the large temperature difference between solar prominences and the corona , this isothermal assumption can only have a minor effect .",
    "in addition , the photosphere is described as a perfectly conducting boundary , as in the papers examined above .",
    "the inner part of the filament is disturbed by a perturbation with a velocity amplitude of 10 km s@xmath0 and at an angle of @xmath15 to the photosphere .",
    "this causes the prominence to move like a rigid body in the corona , both vertically and horizontally , and to undergo exponentially damped oscillations ; see figure  7 in @xcite .",
    "it is found that the horizontal and vertical motions are decoupled from one another ( and so can be investigated separately ) and that the period and damping time of horizontal oscillations are much larger than their respective counterparts for vertical oscillations .",
    "again , strong damping can be achieved for some parameter values ; see figure  [ fig_leakage]b .",
    "it turns out that vertical oscillations are very efficiently attenuated for all the parameters considered in this work and that the same happens with horizontal oscillations for coronal densities above @xmath16 kg m@xmath17 .",
    "these contrasting properties of damped horizontal and vertical oscillations contain some potential for performing seismology of prominences .",
    "now we turn our attention to the interpretation of the results presented so far .",
    "none of the works cited in the first part of this section , i.e. @xcite , mention wave leakage as the cause of the attenuation , but instead these papers connect this behaviour with the effect of the distant photosphere and the presence of time delays in the communication of disturbances between the filament and the photosphere . on the other hand , @xcite link the damping of oscillations to the emission of waves by the prominence : the damping of horizontal motions is attributed to the emission of slow waves , whereas fast waves are invoked as the cause of the damping of vertical motions .",
    "given that the main difference between this work and the other ones lies essentially in the cross section of the filament , there is no reason to believe that the physics involved are much different regardless of the prominence being modeled either as a straight and infinitely thin current or as a current - carrying cylinder .",
    "this issue must be examined in more detail to better understand the dynamics of solar prominences .    a final remark about the exact nature of the wave leakage found by @xcite must be made . in this work ( see their figure  6a ) the plasma-@xmath8 in the prominence ranges from @xmath18 in its central part to @xmath19 at its boundary .",
    "hence , waves emitted by the prominence into the corona propagate in a @xmath20 environment in which magnetic field lines are closed . under these conditions , slow modes propagate along magnetic field lines and are unable to transfer energy from the prominence into the corona and so wave leakage in the system studied by @xcite is only possible by fast waves . then , it is hard to understand how the prominence oscillations can be damped by the emission of slow waves in this particular model , in which the dense , cool plasma is only allowed to emit fast waves",
    ". it must be mentioned , however , that the plasma-@xmath8 in the corona increases with the distance from the filament , which implies that the emitted fast waves can transform into slow waves when they traverse the @xmath21 region .",
    "this effect has been explored by @xcite , but see also references therein for similar studies .",
    "@xcite took into account some dissipative mechanisms and explored , through some order - of - magnitude calculations , their importance as possible damping agents . in this work",
    "we are warned about the simplicity of the calculations and about the neglect of the solar corona , whose role on the damping of prominence oscillations is beyond this simple study .",
    "dissipative mechanisms are separated into isotropic and anisotropic . amongst the first ones , viscosity and magnetic diffusion",
    "are found to be rather inefficient in attenuating perturbations in only a few periods , as demanded by observations .",
    "moreover , radiative losses ( here modeled by means of newton s cooling law , that gives an extremely simplified account of radiation in a solar prominence ) , may be of some importance , although their effect is difficult to establish unambiguously because of the presence of the unknown radiative relaxation time - scale in newton s cooling law .",
    "therefore , radiation by the prominence plasma requires a more specific treatment to determine its significance .",
    "regarding anisotropic mechanisms , in @xcite it is determined that , because of the very large density and very low temperature of prominences , viscosity can be considered isotropic and thus irrelevant as the cause of the observed damping of oscillations . in addition , thermal conduction is dominated by the presence of a magnetic field and is essentially parallel to the field direction .",
    "this mechanism is very efficient as a damping agent for very short wavelengths .",
    "since ballai s work has been extended in other papers discussed below , the meaning of `` very short wavelengths '' will become clear later .",
    "although other damping mechanisms are not contemplated in @xcite , e.g. wave leakage , ion - neutral collisions or resonant absorption , this work is important since it allowed subsequent investigations to discard the irrelevant mechanisms and to concentrate only in the rest .",
    "the efficiency of thermal conduction ( parallel to the magnetic field ) and radiation in transporting heat , and thus in causing the attenuation of oscillations , has been addressed in a number of papers ; see @xcite .",
    "these works are concerned with the spatial and temporal damping of fast and slow waves propagating in a uniform medium .",
    "radiative losses are simulated by equation  ( 7 ) of @xcite , which contains two parameters that can be tuned to represent optically thin or thick radiation ; see @xcite .",
    "different sources of plasma heating are also included , although this mechanism has a negligible consequence on the properties of the waves .    to understand the results of these studies it is worth to consider the characteristic time - scales of thermal conduction and radiative losses ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) , that following e.g. @xcite can be defined as    @xmath24    @xmath25    in these expressions @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the plasma pressure , density and temperature",
    ", @xmath9 is a characteristic length - scale ( the wavelength of oscillations , for example ) , @xmath29 the parallel thermal conductivity and @xmath30 and @xmath1 are the two parameters in hildner s radiative loss function .",
    "we see that @xmath23 is independent of @xmath9 and so the rate at which the plasma looses energy through radiation does not vary with the wavelength or frequency of the waves . on the other hand , the conduction time - scale , @xmath22 , decreases linearly with @xmath9 and so conduction becomes more effective at transporting heat for short wavelengths , just as noticed by @xcite , for example . in the limit of very short wavelengths , conduction is so efficient that the isothermal regime is reached .",
    "the critical wavenumber , @xmath31 , at which this transition occurs is given by @xcite as    @xmath32    for slow and fast waves , respectively . here",
    "@xmath33 is the number density , @xmath34 boltzmann s constant , @xmath35 and @xmath36 the sound and alfvn speeds and @xmath37 the angle between the wavenumber and the unperturbed magnetic field . to derive these formulas it is necessary to assume @xmath38 , together with @xmath39 for the slow mode and @xmath40 for the fast mode , where @xmath41 is the real part of the frequency and @xmath42 the component of the wavenumber parallel to the equilibrium magnetic field .",
    "figure  [ fig_nonadiab ] presents a plot of the characteristic conduction and radiative times together with the critical slow and fast mode wavenumbers marking the transition from the adiabatic to the isothermal regime .",
    "now , let us consider a perturbation with tunable wavelength travelling in a magnetised , uniform medium in which thermal conduction and radiation can transport heat .",
    "let us start with an extremely short wavelength , so that the wavenumber is larger than @xmath31 and the perturbation is isothermal ( hence , we are at the right of figure  [ fig_nonadiab ] ) .",
    "let us now increase the wavelength until the wavenumber becomes just smaller than @xmath31 .",
    "now perturbations are no longer isothermal , but given that thermal conduction is still more efficient than radiation , since it works in a very short time - scale ( i.e. @xmath43 ) , the perturbation is dominated by conduction . next the wavelength is allowed to increase further and consequently the conduction time - scale increases proportionally to @xmath9 . under these conditions ,",
    "conduction becomes less and less efficient and there is eventually a wavenumber ( or length - scale ) at which the conduction and radiation time - scales become equal ; it corresponds to the position in figure  [ fig_nonadiab ] in which the solid and dashed lines cross .",
    "this length - scale , @xmath44 , is obtained by imposing @xmath45 and with the help of equations  ( [ tau_c ] ) and ( [ tau_r ] ) is    @xmath46    finally , for wavelengths larger than @xmath44 radiative losses dominate the energy budget of the plasma",
    ".    these formulas are useful to explain some features of the damping time ( in the case of temporal damping of oscillations ) or the damping length ( in the case of spatial damping ) obtained by @xcite .",
    "consider , for example , the damping time and the damping per period ( @xmath47 ) of the fast mode modified by radiative losses and thermal conduction in a uniform medium .",
    "their variation with the wavenumber is displayed in figure  [ fig_nonadiab2 ] , in which each of the three curves originates from a particular pair of values of @xmath30 and @xmath1 , the two parameters in the radiative loss function . in our discussion",
    "we concentrate on the solid line , although similar conclusions can be deduced for the other two ( and also for the slow mode , which is not examined here ) .",
    "all curves in figure  [ fig_nonadiab2 ] display three changes of slope whose origin can be partly explained on the basis of the transitions between different regimes studied above . for the paramater values used in this work , we have @xmath48 m@xmath0 and @xmath49 m , that corresponds to the wavenumber @xmath50 m@xmath0 .",
    "the right - most change of slope in figure  [ fig_nonadiab2 ] is around @xmath51 and coincides roughly with the value of @xmath52 , so it is caused by the transition between the isothermal and the conduction - dominated regimes .",
    "in addition , the intermediate change of slope is around @xmath53 and its agreement with @xmath54 confirms that it corresponds to the transition from the conduction - dominated to the radiation - dominated regimes .",
    "therefore , the shift from one regime to another leaves its imprint in the variation of @xmath6 and @xmath7 with respect to the wavenumber .",
    "we also note that , since the difference between the three curves of figure  [ fig_nonadiab2 ] lies in the radiative loss function used , they overlap in the conduction dominated regime .",
    "the main conclusions of @xcite regarding the damping of prominence oscillations are that the slow mode is strongly attenuated for wavenumbers within the range of observed values ( i.e. for @xmath55 in the range @xmath56 m@xmath0 ) , while the fast mode is not so strongly damped and its attenuation rate is too small compared with the values from observations . moreover , the considered approximations for optically thin or thick plasmas can give very different attenuation properties and all the considered heating mechanisms are of no relevance .      the influence of the surrounding corona on the damping of magnetoacoustic oscillations via thermal conduction and radiative losses has been studied by @xcite .",
    "in @xcite the filament is taken as a plasma slab embedded in the solar corona and with a uniform magnetic field parallel to the filament axis ; see figure  [ fig_struct_along]a . both the prominence plasma and the coronal plasma are uniform and threaded by the same magnetic field . to understand the results of @xcite it is necessary to describe the main properties of the linear , adiabatic normal modes of such a configuration , that have been studied by @xcite . in the latter work",
    "the solutions are classified in three types ( figure  [ fig_modes_along ] ) : fast , internal slow and external slow modes and it is concluded that the perturbations associated to internal slow modes are essentially confined to the prominence slab , so that these waves are hardly influenced by the coronal environment . on the other hand ,",
    "fast modes have tails that penetrate in the corona and as a result coronal conditions are important in determining the features of these waves .",
    "moreover , the confinement of fast modes becomes poorer for small values of the wavenumber in the direction of the filament axis .",
    "regarding external slow modes , they produce almost negligible perturbed amplitudes inside the cold slab and thus seem uninteresting in the context of prominence oscillations .",
    "@xcite included the thermal conduction , radiative losses and plasma heating terms in the energy equation and studied the damping properties of the fast and internal and external slow modes .",
    "they obtained values of @xmath7 in agreement with observations both for the internal slow and the fast modes ; this last result implies that the presence of the surrounding corona modifies the damping properties of fast waves . such as expected ,",
    "the damping rate of the internal slow mode is not modified by the inclusion of the corona in the model and it only depends on the value of the wavenumber in the direction parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "the attenuation of this mode can be recovered by inserting the parallel wavenumber , @xmath42 , in the expression @xmath57 and by substituting @xmath35 by a `` modified sound speed '' , @xmath58 , whose square is given by    @xmath59    where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are determined from the partial derivatives of the heat - loss function with respect to density and temperature , respectively .",
    "the damping time of the fast kink mode , however , is severely influenced by the addition of the coronal medium .",
    "this can be clearly appreciated by comparing the damping time in a uniform medium ( figure  [ fig_nonadiab2]a ) and in a structured medium with longitudinal magnetic field ( figure  [ fig_fast_mode_along ] ) .",
    "the reason for such a strong modification of the fast kink mode damping time is , firstly , that this mode couples with the external slow mode , whose properties are essentially dictated by the coronal plasma . and secondly , apart from this coupling the coronal medium has a direct influence because of the presence of coronal tails in the perturbed variables . in @xcite a close examination of the role of the corona in the damping of the fast mode",
    "was done by removing one of the important non - adiabatic mechanisms ( thermal conduction or radiation ) either in the filament or in the corona and then computing the period and damping time .",
    "the relevance of each mechanism is revealed by a discrepancy between the damping time computed with and without this mechanism ( figure  [ fig_fast_mode_along ] ) .",
    "the conclusion of this study is that coronal mechanisms govern the attenuation of the fast modes for wavenumbers @xmath62  m@xmath0 , whereas prominence mechanisms prevail for @xmath63 m@xmath0 . in each of these ranges radiation",
    "is dominant in the low-@xmath42 range and thermal conduction is dominant in the high-@xmath42 range , such as found in section  [ non - adiab - unif - medium ] for a uniform medium .",
    "more specifically , coronal radiation controls the attenuation for @xmath64 m@xmath0 , coronal conduction does so for @xmath65 m@xmath0 @xmath66 m@xmath0 , while prominence radiation and conduction are the most important non - adiabatic mechanisms for @xmath67 m@xmath0 @xmath68 m@xmath0 and @xmath69 m@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "hence , in the range of observed wavelengths both thermal conduction in the corona and radiation from the prominence gas are important to explain the reported damping times . in section  [ non - adiab - unif - medium ] the characteristic time - scales of thermal conduction and radiation in a uniform medium were invoked to explain the transition from the radiation - dominated wavenumber range to the conduction - dominated wavenumber range .",
    "the same idea can be applied to explain this transition in the present , structured configuration both for the prominence and for the corona . in the case of the prominence ,",
    "the transition value is the same as before , namely @xmath70 m@xmath0 , whereas for the corona it is @xmath71  m@xmath0 .",
    "these numbers coincide well with the transitions at which different mechanisms dominate in figure  [ fig_fast_mode_along ] .",
    "moreover , the wavenumber at which the transition between the ranges of dominance of coronal conduction and prominence radiation takes place can be derived from the equality of @xmath22 in the corona and @xmath23 in the prominence .",
    "this calculation yields @xmath72 m@xmath0 , also in good agreement with the value from figure  [ fig_fast_mode_along ] .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite .    in @xcite a prominence - corona configuration with an equilibrium magnetic field perpendicular to the prominence slab",
    "is considered ; see figure  [ fig_struct_along]b . such a structure can support fast and slow modes of internal or external character , depending on whether their properties are governed mainly by the prominence or the corona , respectively .",
    "moreover , there is another type of fast and slow mode , called string by @xcite and hybrid by @xcite , that is simultaneously internal and external .",
    "@xcite find that slow modes are efficiently damped by the considered non - adiabatic mechanisms ( thermal conduction and radiative losses ) , such as found by @xcite for a perpendicular orientation of the magnetic field .",
    "it is also shown that prominence radiation dominates the attenuation of internal slow modes and that prominence radiation and coronal conduction together dominate that of the hybrid slow mode .",
    "this result for the hybrid mode is coherent with the fact that its perturbations achieve large amplitudes both in the prominence and the corona , so one expects that the most relevant damping mechanisms of each medium govern together the attenuation of the hybrid mode . on the other hand ,",
    "fast modes are very poorly damped in the present configuration , which implies that the assumed magnetic field orientation is decisive for these modes .",
    "a remarkable feature of fast modes is that they can become unstable under certain circumstances .",
    "thermal conduction allows energy transfer between the prominence slab and the coronal medium .",
    "prominence radiation has an essential role in dissipating the extra heat injected from the corona and stabilises the oscillations .",
    "nevertheless , thermal instabilities appear if radiative losses from the prominence plasma are omitted or significantly reduced ( e.g. caused by an increase of the optical thickness ) since the plasma can not dissipate the extra injected heat in an efficient way .",
    "given that different parametrisations of the radiative loss function have been given in the literature @xcite and that they correspond to different optical thicknesses , the relevance of the optical thickness in the stability of fast waves is not firmly established yet .",
    "material flows are common features in solar prominences @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated the attenuation of the slow and thermal waves by radiative losses and thermal conduction in a uniform medium with flow . in this work the fast mode is ignored because these non - adiabatic effects do not contribute in a significant way to its attenuation @xcite ; slow and thermal waves are investigated in the limit of field - aligned propagation .",
    "@xcite find that the period and damping per period can show a strong dependence on @xmath73 , the flow speed , for certain values of this parameter ; figure  [ fig_nonadiab_flow ] presents their results for the slow mode .",
    "they also find that the greatest period and damping per period of slow waves is obtained for flow speeds close to the real part of the non - adiabatic sound speed , which in the presence of flow is deduced from equation  ( [ nonadiab_sound_speed ] ) with @xmath74 substituted by @xmath75 .",
    "regarding the thermal mode , which in the absence of flow does not propagate , it is found that it becomes propagating for @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , when flows and time damped oscillations are observed in a prominence / filament , this wave should be also taken into account as potentially responsible of the observed damped oscillations",
    ". these authors remark that it may not be possible to determine whether an observed period and damping time are associated to a slow wave or a thermal wave in a flowing material and that a possibility to determine the origin of such wave is to resort to the temperature perturbation , which should be rather large for the thermal wave and much smaller for the slow wave .      instead of considering the attenuation of perturbations in a full - prominence configuration , as in section  [ nonadiab_slab ] , @xcite",
    "restrict themselves to a single thread .",
    "their model consists of a homogeneous , infinite cylinder representing the thread embedded in an unbounded corona ; see figure  [ fig_nonadiab_thread]a .",
    "two additional ingredients of the model are a uniform magnetic field both inside and outside the thread and flow motions parallel to the magnetic field in both regions .",
    "thermal conduction and radiative losses are taken into account as damping mechanisms , and the combined effect of these non - ideal physics and the steady flow on the attenuation of oscillations is assessed . in this work it is found that , in the absence of flow , slow modes are efficiently damped by non - adiabatic effects , while fast kink waves are in practice not attenuated , since their damping times are much larger than typical lifetimes of filament threads .",
    "therefore , the damping by non - adiabatic mechanisms of kink oscillations is much less efficient in this cylindrical case than in the slab geometry ( figure  [ fig_nonadiab_thread]b ) . in the presence of flow",
    "it is well - known that the symmetry between waves propagating parallel or antiparallel to the flow is broken .",
    "the thermal mode behaves as a wave that propagates parallel to the flow , and its motions are mainly polarized along the longitudinal direction . nevertheless , this oscillatory behaviour is not likely to be observed in practice due to its quick damping .",
    "the damping time of both slow and thermal waves is not affected by the flow . on the contrary , for realistic values of the flow velocity , the larger the flow , the larger the attenuation of parallel fast kink waves , whereas the contrary occurs for antiparallel fast kink solutions . nevertheless , this effect is not enough to obtain realistic damping times in the case of fast kink modes .",
    "chromospheric and prominence plasmas are not fully ionised and so several new effects are present in comparison to a fully ionised plasma .",
    "for example , electric charges are frozen to magnetic field lines , but neutrals are not and thus the neutral and ionised fractions of the plasma behave differently .",
    "collisions between neutrals , on one hand , and electrons and ions , on the other hand , arise and consequently a modified ohm s law is obtained . as a consequence ,",
    "the main outcome of the interaction between neutrals and charged particles is the presence of enhanced joule heating and enhanced magnetic diffusion .",
    "these ideas were presented by @xcite in connection with the heating of the solar chromosphere and corona and have also been invoked to explain the dynamics of chromospheric spicules ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and of flux tubes emerging from the solar interior @xcite .",
    "the influence of partial ionisation of the prominence plasma on the properties of the fast and slow modes has been investigated by @xcite . in this work",
    "the one - fluid mhd equations for a partially ionised plasma made of electrons , protons and neutral hydrogen are derived .",
    "next , a uniform medium with a straight magnetic field is considered .",
    "the linear regime is assumed and this results in the vanishing of the joule heating term in the energy equation , so that the corresponding physical effect is absent .",
    "one may conclude that in more realistic configurations dissipation may be stronger than that found by @xcite .",
    "the main result of this work is that the fast mode can be strongly damped ( in agreement with observations ) for small values of the ionisation fraction ( figure  [ fig_pip ] ) , whereas the slow mode is hardly attenuated .",
    "the mechanism responsible for the damping of the fast mode is cowling s diffusion , that vanishes in a fully ionised plasma .",
    "an analytical approximation for the fast mode damping rate ,    @xmath77    is derived by @xcite , with @xmath78 the relative density of neutrals , @xmath27 the gas density , @xmath79 the magnetic field strength and @xmath55 the modulus of the wavenumber .",
    "such a simple expression can be of practical use in the interpretation of observations .",
    "it indicates that the damping is stronger , i.e. @xmath7 is smaller , for almost neutral plasmas with low density , strong magnetic field and for short wavelengths .",
    "a natural extension of @xcite , concerned with the attenuation of fast and slow waves by thermal conduction and radiation , and @xcite , concerned with the attenuation of the same waves by ion - neutral effects , is to consider together a partially ionised plasma with thermal conduction and radiative losses .",
    "this task was performed by @xcite , who derived the equations governing the dynamics of such medium .",
    "a particularly interesting issue is the different conduction properties of electrons ( mainly along magnetic field lines ) and neutrals ( isotropic ) , which implies that the contribution of the neutral species to the thermal conduction must be taken into account separately following @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that the period of the magnetoacoustic waves remains basically the same as in the ideal case and that their model gives values of the ratio of the damping time to the period similar to the ones obtained in observations for the three wave modes ( fast , slow and alfvn ) .",
    "in addition , the inclusion of non - adiabatic terms in the partially ionised set of equations increases the damping of fast and slow waves in the interval of observed wavelegths as compared with the results obtained for a non - adiabatic fully ionised plasma @xcite and an adiabatic partially ionised plasma @xcite . for slow waves ,",
    "the minima of the ratio of @xmath7 , corresponding to attenuation maxima , are displaced towards longer wavelengths as compared to when only thermal conduction and radiative losses are included in the model .",
    "an increase of the neutral portion in the plasma produces a displacement of these ranges of maximum damping to longer wavelengths ( figure  [ fig_pip_nonadiab]a ) .",
    "radiative losses are dominant for long wavelengths ( just as found by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the rest of the wavenumber interval is dominated by thermal conduction and ion - neutral collisions .",
    "regarding fast waves , radiation is the dominant damping mechanism for long wavelengths , while in the rest of the considered wavenumber interval the attenuation is dominated by the effect of ion - neutral collisions .",
    "an important result is that fast waves only exist for wavenumbers smaller than a critical value that depends on the ionisation fraction ( see figure  [ fig_pip_nonadiab]b ) . in spite of this , the critical wavenumber is large in comparison with the typical wavenumbers of waves in prominences .",
    "finally , for typical prominence temperature values , the contribution of electrons to thermal conduction is negligible in front of the contribution of neutrals .",
    "the plasma density varies by about two orders of magnitude between a filament thread and the surrounding corona . in such a highly inhomogeneous configuration",
    "fast kink modes can be efficiently damped by transferring their energy to alfvn modes through resonant absorption .",
    "@xcite examine the relevance of this mechanism in the attenuation of small amplitude prominence oscillations by modeling the magnetic and plasma configuration of an individual fibril as an infinitely long , straight , cylindrically symmetric flux tube of mean radius @xmath80 surrounded by a coaxial layer of thickness @xmath81 ( figure  [ fig_thread_model ] ) . the @xmath82 approximation is used .",
    "the coronal and thread densities are denoted by @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively , and their ratio as @xmath85 .",
    "this parameter is much larger than unity and probably of the order of 100 or larger . in this simple model , the magnetic tube representing the thread",
    "only contains cool material , i.e. the presence of hot material inside the tube is ignored . taking into account that the observed propagating waves in threads have a wavelength , @xmath86 , much larger than the tube radius , @xcite start by using the long - wavelength approximation to make some analytical progress .",
    "next , they use the so - called thin boundary approximation ( @xmath87 ) to derive the following expression for the ratio of the damping time to the period    @xmath88    where @xmath89 is a numerical factor that depends on the particular variation of the density in the nonuniform layer : for a linear variation @xmath90 @xcite , while for a sinusoidal variation @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "a simple substitution in this formula of a density ratio @xmath92 and @xmath93 , which corresponds to a transitional layer whose thickness is 10% the thread radius , yields @xmath94 , in good agreement with observations .",
    "then , this analytical approximation seems to indicate that the process of resonant absorption is an efficient damping mechanism for fast mhd oscillations propagating in these structures .",
    "next , @xcite solve numerically the full set of linear , resistive , small - amplitude mhd wave equations for the transverse kink oscillations . in this manner ,",
    "the approximations that lead to equation  ( [ eq_res_abs ] ) are avoided .",
    "these numerical calculations confirm the analytical estimate that , for the typical large filament to coronal density contrast , the mechanism produces rapid damping on timescales of the order of a few oscillatory periods only .",
    "they also reveal that for thin layers ( @xmath95 ) the inaccuracy of the long - wavelength approximation produces differences of up to @xmath96% for the combination of short wavelength with high - contrast thread . for thick layers , differences of the order of 20%",
    "are obtained ( in agreement with * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , the authors conclude ( as shown by figure  [ fig_res_abs ] ) that the obtained damping rates are only slightly dependent on the wavelength of perturbations and that the damping rate becomes independent of the density contrast for large values of this parameter .",
    "this last result has two seismological consequences .",
    "first , the observational determination of the density contrast is less critical than it is in the low - contrast regime , the one corresponding to coronal loops .",
    "second , according to seismic inversion results that combine the theoretical and observed periods and damping times @xcite , high - density thread models would be compatible with relatively short transverse inhomogeneity length scales .    in a subsequent work , @xcite note that in a @xmath97 plasma with prominence conditions embedded in the much hotter corona the fast kink mode can also undergo a resonant coupling to slow continuum modes .",
    "hence , it is argued , the combined effect of the two resonant couplings may lead to an enhanced attenuation rate of the kink mode .",
    "the structure considered by @xcite is a thread identical to that of figure  [ fig_thread_model ] , although the @xmath82 assumption is removed from their calculations and , consequently , the plasma pressure is finite . such as in @xcite , in this work",
    "a combination of analytical expressions and numerical analysis is used .",
    "the analytical formulas not only allow to predict the positions of the slow and alfvn resonances , but they also provide the contribution of each of the two mechanisms to the damping time , @xmath98 and @xmath99 , whose ratio is    @xmath100    with @xmath101 and @xmath102 the azimuthal and longitudinal wavenumbers and @xmath35 and @xmath36 the sound and alfvn speeds . using @xmath103 and a typical value for the wavelength ( @xmath104 ) results in @xmath105 , which means that the resonant coupling of the kink mode with the alfvn continuum produces an attenuation rate that is @xmath106 times smaller than that coming from the coupling with the slow continuum .",
    "these results are also verified from the numerical computations ( see figure  [ fig_slow_cont ] ) , which confirm that resonant absorption with the slow continuum is irrelevant in the damping of the observed transverse thread oscillations .",
    "although the study of small - amplitude waves and oscillations in prominences constitutes a discipline that might complement the direct determination of prominence parameters by providing independent values based in the comparison between observations and theory , so far prominence seismology is more a promise than a reality because of the large gap between observation and theory .",
    "the analysis presented in section  [ seismology ] is a good example of a seismological application to prominences , but , unfortunately , it is the only one of its kind .",
    "such a gap arises because of the little restrictions imposed by observational works ( which sometimes reduce to reporting the period of the detected oscillations ) and the simplicity of theoretical studies ( which neglect the intricate nature of prominences and substitute it by a very simplified physical model ) .",
    "nevertheless , these two sides are coming together as the complexity of works increases .",
    "in this paper the possible role of several physical mechanisms in the attenuation of prominence oscillations has been reviewed .",
    "it has been shown that both the fast and slow waves can undergo strong damping under a variety of physical conditions and with the intervention of different effects .",
    "nevertheless , the list of the presumably relevant mechanisms has not been totally explored and other effects should be investigated .",
    "in addition , the geometry of the models is too simplified , which implies that the results derived so far only give a rough guide to the damping features in actual prominences .",
    "the efficiency of wave leakage and coronal conduction in draining oscillatory energy from the prominence and transferring it to the corona calls for the study of complex configurations in which the structure of the full prominence - corona system is treated more realistically .",
    "most of the works are based on the linear approximation , whose validity seems quite robust in view of the small amplitude of prominence oscillations in many cases .",
    "nevertheless , apart from the so - called small - amplitude prominence oscillations , that in general affect small regions of a prominence and have doppler velocity peaks typically below 12 km s@xmath0 , there is a different kind of phenomenon , the large - amplitude oscillations ( tripathi et al . 2009 , this volume ) .",
    "they are characterised by a much higher amplitude ( with oscillatory velocities up to 90 km  s@xmath0 ) and disturb the whole filament ; see @xcite .",
    "these prominence vibrations also damp very rapidly , in a few periods , so it is in order to ascertain whether the mechanisms at work in the damping of small - amplitude oscillations are also the main ones for the large - amplitude counterparts or whether non - linear effects can also cause the attenuation of the latter .",
