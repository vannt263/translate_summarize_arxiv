    "chiral symmetry breaking is undoubtedly one of the most important concepts for understanding hadron physics in low energy region @xcite .",
    "the smallness of @xmath5 and @xmath6 masses is beautifully explained if one identifies them with the nambu - goldstone ( ng ) bosons associated with the chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "an important aspect of this phenomenon is dynamical formation of ng bosons as bound states of quarks and gluons in the strong coupling region .",
    "however , its complete demonstration in qcd is not reached yet because of the difficulties in describing bound states in a nonperturbative and relativistic manner . instead",
    ", many people have been investigating much simpler effective models of qcd . among them , the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite is the most deeply and thoroughly understood .",
    "the njl model is a 3 + 1 dimensional four - fermi theory and reproduces various properties of hadrons concerning the chiral symmetry breaking despite some undesirable features such as nonrenormalizability and lack of confinement @xcite .",
    "nowadays the model plays a role of laboratory in which we can test new ideas proposed for nonperturbative study of low energy qcd .",
    "therefore the njl model is the most appropriate model in which we can check whether the light - front ( lf ) quantization can be applied to the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the lf quantization is a newly revamped nonperturbative method for solving relativistic bound states in quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "let us explain why the chiral symmetry breaking becomes a special issue in the lf formalism .",
    "the reason is twofold : the first is apparent contradiction between a nontrivial vacuum and a lf `` trivial '' vacuum , and the second is peculiarity of lf chiral transformation . to resolve these problems is our primary purpose in the present paper .",
    "one of the remarkable merits of the lf quantization is that the fock vacuum defined by a free theory is also the vacuum of the full theory .",
    "many technical advantages such as exact fock state expansion arise from this fact . on the contrary",
    ", the conventional formulation says that the chiral symmetry breaking is essentially a physics of finding another vacuum that breaks the chiral symmetry but is energetically favored .",
    "such `` vacuum physics '' is thought to be very important for understanding nonperturbative phenomena in low energy region .",
    "therefore to apply the lf formalism to qcd necessarily entails a problem how to realize such `` vacuum physics '' within a framework with a trivial vacuum . for the purpose of understanding this problem ,",
    "there are considerable efforts @xcite to describe the spontaneous symmetry breaking in a simple scalar model ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "they succeeded in obtaining the critical coupling which is consistent with the conventional results .",
    "the key is to solve a constraint equation for the longitudinal zero mode ( `` zero - mode constraint '' ) which appears in the dlcq ( discretized light - cone quantization ) method @xcite .",
    "a nonzero condensate is realized as a nonperturbative solution of the zero - mode constraint .",
    "we will discuss this method in more detail later .    compared with such extensive studies , only little",
    "is known about the _",
    "dynamical _ symmetry breaking in _ fermionic _ systems .",
    "especially there have been only few attempts about the njl model on the lf @xcite . at first glance",
    ", it seems not possible to follow the same route as in the scalar models because we do not have bosonic fields as fundamental degrees of freedom in the njl model .",
    "however , we can apply the same idea to the dynamical symmetry breaking if one introduces _ bosonic _",
    "auxiliary fields to the fermion bilinears and raises them to dynamical variables by adding their kinetic terms .",
    "of course the original fermionic model is reproduced as an infinitely heavy mass limit of the bosonic fields . according to this idea",
    ", we succeeded in describing the dynamical symmetry breaking ( discrete chiral symmetry ) in the 1 + 1 dimensional four - fermi theory ( the gross - neveu model ) @xcite . the present paper is a generalization of this preliminary work which discussed only _ discrete _ chiral symmetry .",
    "we consider a kind of yukawa model with _ continuous _ chiral symmetry , which is obtained from the njl model using the above technique .",
    "we work within the dlcq method so that _ we can formulate the problem from the viewpoint of the zero - mode constraints_. it should be commented however that it is possible to discuss the dynamical symmetry breaking even without introducing auxiliary fields . in ref .",
    "@xcite , one of the authors insisted the importance of a `` fermionic constraint '' which is again unique to the lf formulation and has very complicated structure due to the four - fermi interaction .",
    "( another merit of including scalar fields is a quite simplification of the fermionic constraint . )",
    "more detailed analysis in this direction will be reported in the next paper @xcite .",
    "one more point to be discussed is the unusual behavior of chiral transformation on the lf . in the lf formulation ,",
    "a half degree of freedom of the fermion is a dependent variable to be represented by other independent variables .",
    "therefore , chiral transformation should be imposed only on the independent component of the fermion @xcite .",
    "it is not clear in interacting models whether the lf chiral transformation is equivalent to the usual one or not .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we define the chiral yukawa model which is closely related to the njl model and introduce our framework , the dlcq method .",
    "the classical aspects of the model is discussed in sec .",
    "iii . here , we see that there are three constraints ( i.e. two zero - mode constraints and one fermionic constraint ) .",
    "we also show peculiarity of the lf chiral transformation and explicitly give the null - plane chiral charge @xmath4 . quantum analysis , which is the main part of this paper , is developed in sections iv and v. in sec .",
    "iv , we demonstrate that perturbative and nonperturbative treatments of the solution to the constraints give different description of the model . in sec .",
    "v , we discuss some physics consequences of the nonperturbative analysis . especially , we resolve a problem of contradiction between the triviality of the null - plane charge and the nonzero condensate .",
    "we further calculate the masses of scalars in the symmetric and broken phases .",
    "then we discuss the pcac relations and nonconservation of the lf chiral charge @xmath4 in the broken phase .",
    "the last section is devoted to conclusion and discussions .",
    "here we introduce the model ( chiral yukawa model ) and summarize the standard knowledge on the chiral symmetry breaking in the conventional equal - time formulation .",
    "we also define our setup of the problem following the dlcq method .",
    "the njl model was first introduced as the simplest @xmath8 dimensional example which exhibits the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking @xcite . in its original form",
    "there were two flavors , but a one flavor model @xmath9\\ ] ] also breaks the chiral symmetry which exists in the massless case @xmath10 .",
    "we give an additional internal structure to the fermion independently of the flavor , and treat an @xmath11-component spinor @xmath12 in order to clarify the validity of approximation we use . from now on , summation over @xmath13",
    "is always implied . since",
    "this model is not renormalizable , we must specify a regularization scheme such as a cutoff to uniquely determine the model and to obtain finite results .    in this paper , we discuss more general model with yukawa interactions : @xmath14 where @xmath0 ( @xmath5 ) is a scalar ( pseudoscalar ) boson with mass @xmath15 and @xmath16 is a dimensionless parameter .",
    "if one takes infinitely heavy mass limit for scalars @xmath17 , the dynamical scalars become auxiliary fields @xmath18 , @xmath19 and the model goes back to the njl model .    in order to contrast with our lf calculation ,",
    "let us briefly comment on the usual story of chiral symmetry breaking in the njl model @xcite .",
    "when @xmath10 , both of the lagrangian densities are invariant under the chiral transformation : @xmath20 it should be reminded that this transformation is , of course , imposed on all the fields , which is , however , not the case in the lf formalism .",
    "this point will be discussed later in more detail .",
    "the usual story is as follows : the chiral symmetry breaks down spontaneously in a quantum level due to nonzero fermion condensate @xmath21",
    ". the most straightforward demonstration will be the mean field approximation with the concept of self - consistency .",
    "if one has @xmath11-component fermion , we can justify the mean field approximation by the leading approximation of @xmath22 expansion .",
    "the self - consistency condition is a crucial key to the description of broken phase .",
    "this condition directly leads to the gap equation which determines the value of condensate and , equivalently , the physical fermion mass . as a result of symmetry breaking , there emerges a nambu - goldstone boson . since we do not have any fundamental scalar boson in the njl model , the ng boson ( pion )",
    "should be supplied dynamically as a bound state of a fermion and an anti - fermion .",
    "mass of the pionic state indeed vanishes in the chiral limit",
    ".    it will be helpful to comment on the physics meaning of treating the model ( [ aa ] ) .",
    "first of all , we should clearly distinguish our model from the linear @xmath0 model of gell - mann and lvy @xcite .",
    "structurally our model resembles the @xmath0 model in the sense that it consists of bosons and fermions interacting with each other via yukawa couplings and has a continuous chiral symmetry . however , an important difference in our model is the absence of potential term for scalars . in the linear @xmath0 model , it is the wine - bottle potential that induces the chiral symmetry breaking",
    ". therefore the symmetry breaking occurs in the _ tree _ level and the dynamical formation of ng boson can not be seen .",
    "what we obtain is only the sigma condensate @xmath23 .",
    "this naturally leads us to identify the fermions with nucleons model ( i.e. , _ with _ the wine - bottle potential ) regarding the fermions as quarks .",
    "but such treatment does not tell anything about _",
    "dynamical _ chiral symmetry breaking and therefore should be clearly distinguished from our standpoint . ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the fermions in our model should be regarded as quarks rather than nucleons .",
    "indeed , as far as the leading order of @xmath22 expansion is concerned , the model shows the same behavior as the njl model .",
    "for example , straightforward calculations such as effective potential @xcite or mean - field approximation show that the chiral symmetry breaking @xmath24 occurs in the one - loop quantum level ( see appendix a for more details ) .",
    "therefore we do not consider our model as a special case of the linear @xmath0 model and in order to remind this , we call it the `` chiral yukawa model ''",
    ".    it is also very important to view the njl model as a low - energy effective theory of the chiral yukawa model .",
    "the relation between two models is very similar to that between the weinberg - salam model and the fermi theory of weak interaction : the chiral yukawa model is renormalizable and the fermions interact with each other by exchanging scalar or pseudo - scalar bosons .",
    "if we take the infinitely heavy mass limit for bosons @xmath25 , then the theory reduces to the njl model with non - renormalizable four - fermi interactions . in this sense",
    ", the njl model can be considered as a low energy effective theory of the chiral yukawa model .",
    "such low energy approximation will be valid when the momentum is much smaller than the mass of the exchanged particles @xmath26 . in this paper",
    ", we mainly treat the chiral yukawa model for technical reasons , but what we eventually want to know are results of the njl model .",
    "therefore even if we encounter divergences during calculation in the chiral yukawa model , we only regularize them by some cutoff scheme and do not renormalize them .    finally , as far as we are discussing such low energy region",
    ", we do not have to worry about the problem of double counting of physics degrees of freedom . in the njl model ,",
    "the scalar and pseudo - scalar bosons are described as quark - antiquark bound states . on the other hand",
    ", we treat the scalars as physically independent degrees of freedom in the chiral yukawa model .",
    "so if we regard the fermions and scalars as quarks and mesons , there is the problem of double counting with which we are always confronted in treating chiral - quark type models @xcite .",
    "however , in the low energy region , or equivalently for sufficiently large boson mass @xmath27 , the scalars become `` frozen '' and do not behave as propagating degrees of freedom .",
    "we analyze the chiral yukawa model ( [ aa ] ) in the dlcq method and take special care of the longitudinal zero modes of scalars . in this method , we compactify the longitudinal space into a circle @xmath28 $ ] with appropriate boundary conditions on fields . for scalars ,",
    "we impose periodic boundary conditions at each lf time @xmath29 so that we can explicitly treat the longitudinal zero modes defined by @xmath30 then the scalar fields are decomposed into the zero modes and the remaining oscillation modes : @xmath31    on the other hand , we impose an antiperiodic boundary condition for the fermion field , @xmath32 here we must be careful about the boundary condition on the `` bad component '' of the fermion . as we discuss in the next section ,",
    "if we decompose the fermion as @xmath33 we find that @xmath34 ( `` bad component '' ) is a dependent field ( see appendix for the definition of @xmath35 ) .",
    "so the boundary condition on @xmath34 should be imposed consistently with the dynamics .",
    "for example , if we imposed the periodic boundary condition on @xmath34 and antiperiodic on @xmath36 , the mass term @xmath37 and the fermion s kinetic term became antiperiodic .",
    "this is not desirable as a term in the lagrangian and even not consistent with the scalar sector .",
    "then how about the periodic boundary conditions for both of @xmath36 and @xmath34 ?",
    "in this case we have a dynamical zero mode of @xmath36 , which is , however , not important to our problem because the chiral condensate will be related to the zero modes of @xmath0 or @xmath38 .",
    "periodic fermion will give unnecessary intricacy to the problem .",
    "therefore the antiperiodic boundary condition ( [ be ] ) is appropriate .",
    "classical analysis is necessary for specifying independent degrees of freedom . in this section ,",
    "we determine the constraint structure of the model and define the lf chiral transformation .",
    "chiral current and charge are explicitly given .",
    "the system has three important constraints characteristic of the lf formalism : a constraint for @xmath34 ( fermionic constraint ) and two constraints for zero modes of bosons ( zero - mode constraints ) .",
    "the euler - lagrange equation for @xmath34 itself is the fermionic constraint : @xmath39 also the zero - mode constraints for @xmath40 and @xmath41 are easily obtained from @xmath42-integration of the euler - lagrange equations for @xmath0 and @xmath5 , respectively : @xmath43_0=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath44_0 $ ] denotes integration over @xmath42 ( see appendix b ) .",
    "more explicitly , @xmath45_0 .",
    "\\label{acc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these equations mean that @xmath46 and @xmath47 should be represented by other independent variables .",
    "if we take the @xmath27 limit , the zero - mode constraints are reduced to zero - mode projected equations of the familiar relations @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "eventually the independent degrees of freedom are nonzero modes of the scalars @xmath48 , and the `` good component '' of the spinor @xmath36 .",
    "the above constraints are , of course , derived from dirac s procedure ( see appendix c ) .",
    "it is easily found that they belong to the second class .",
    "definition of chiral transformation on the lf is different from the usual one eqs .",
    "( [ ace ] ) and ( [ acf ] ) .",
    "this is because the identification of independent degrees of freedom is not the same as usual . as we saw , _",
    "@xmath49 and @xmath50 are dependent variables and should change as a result of transformation of the independent variables @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "_ therefore in the lf formulation , we impose the chiral transformation only on the dynamical variables : @xmath53 @xmath54 where @xmath55 represents a rotation matrix defined in eq .",
    "( [ acf ] ) .",
    "these are the definition of the `` lf chiral transformation '' .",
    "if we find that @xmath34 and @xmath56 also transform as @xmath57 and @xmath58 as a result of ( [ acg ] ) and ( [ ach ] ) , we can say that the `` lf chiral transformation '' is substantially equivalent to the usual one ( [ ace ] ) and ( [ acf ] ) .",
    "however , what is surprising about the `` lf chiral transformation '' is that the transformation ( [ acg ] ) is an exact symmetry even for _ massive _ fermion as far as interaction is absent @xcite .",
    "so it will be interesting to check whether the `` lf chiral transformation '' in our model is exact or not when a mass term is present .    in order to see the transformation property of the dependent variables ,",
    "let us solve the constraints _ classically_. this means that we completely ignore the ordering of the variables which becomes a burdensome but important issue in a quantum treatment . the fermionic constraint ( [ acaa ] ) which was originally a complicated relation in the purely fermionic njl model ,",
    "is now easily solved owing to introduction of scalars .",
    "the zero - mode constraints are also solved formally .",
    "explicit form of the solutions is given in appendix c. now we find the transformation of the zero modes and subsequently that of @xmath34 .",
    "let us first consider the massless fermion case . when @xmath10 , it is easy to see that the transformation ( [ acg ] ) and ( [ ach ] ) induces the following : @xmath59 @xmath60 this is identical with the usual chiral transformation . therefore it is shown that when @xmath10 the fields do transform as ( [ ace ] ) and ( [ acf ] ) even on the lf at the classical level .    now that we know all the transformation laws , it is straightforward to construct the noether current and charge .",
    "the lagrangian with @xmath61 is invariant under the lf chiral transformations .",
    "form of the lf chiral current is equivalent to the usual one , @xmath62 however , @xmath63 and @xmath34 in ( [ btf ] ) should be understood as solutions of the constraints .",
    "on the other hand , the lf chiral charge @xmath64 does not include the constrained variables : @xmath65 ,    \\label{btg}\\ ] ] which is consistent with the fact that @xmath4 is a generator of the chiral rotation for independent variables .",
    "transformation of other dependent fields should be obtained through the change of dynamical variables .",
    "the massive fermion case is much more complicated .",
    "as mentioned before , an astonishing fact of the `` lf chiral transformation '' is that it is an exact symmetry even for a massive free fermion @xcite .",
    "when the mass term is present , the `` bad component '' of free fermion does not transform as eq .",
    "( [ bte ] ) .",
    "subsequently , the associated noether current @xmath66 has an extra term proportional to the bare mass @xmath67 nevertheless , the divergence of the current turns out to be zero @xmath68 due to the cancellation between the first term ( @xmath69 ) and the second term .",
    "this should be compared with the usual current in the equal - time quantization : @xmath70 , which also holds for interacting theories and is intimately connected with pcac relation . note that the lf chiral charge @xmath71 is equivalent to that in the massless case due to @xmath72 .",
    "this is natural because the lf chiral transformation is defined irrespective of the mass term .",
    "now , how about the chiral yukawa model ? using the solution for @xmath73 ( see appendix c ) , the infinitesimal chiral transformation of @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath34 are given as follows : @xmath74 where @xmath75_0   , \\ ] ] and @xmath76 is the transverse differential operator defined in appendix c. it is evident that the dependent fields do not transform as eqs .",
    "( [ btd ] ) and ( [ bte ] ) . as a result ,",
    "the noether current ( [ btf ] ) also gets modified by the term proportional to @xmath77 .",
    "the explicit form of the current @xmath78 is very complicated but we can see that the @xmath79 component is equivalent to that of ( [ btf ] ) .",
    "therefore the lf chiral charge is given by eq .",
    "( [ btg ] ) even for massive case .",
    "however , contrary to the massive free fermion , the divergence of the lf current @xmath80 does not vanish due to nontrivial interactions .",
    "one of the lessons suggested by these observations is that when we investigate physics related to massive fermions ( e.g. pcac relation ) , we had better treat the current @xmath81 defined by the massless fermions rather than @xmath82 .",
    "this is clear for the free case : the true lf chiral current @xmath83 ( [ current ] ) defined for the massive fermion vanishes if we take the divergence while that for massless fermion @xmath84 gives the usual relation .",
    "this is true of the chiral yukawa model .",
    "the divergence of the current ( [ btf ] ) is given as @xmath85 while @xmath80 is very complicated .",
    "it will be very difficult to discuss the pcac relations etc . by using @xmath82 .",
    "it is not quite clear if analysis of @xmath82 makes sense .",
    "instead , even for the massive case , we treat the current ( [ btf ] ) to discuss the physics such as pcac .",
    "this point will be discussed later again in section v.",
    "in the classical analysis , we formally solved the constraints in order to find the lf chiral current and charge .",
    "when @xmath10 , the resulting hamiltonian is chiral symmetric and we do not have any symmetry breaking term . therefore even if we go to quantum theory with such hamiltonian , we will not be able to describe the chiral symmetry breaking . certainly it might be possible that we could find a broken phase hamiltonian by adjusting the operator ordering , but such procedure seems unnatural and tricky .",
    "instead , we quantize the model before solving the constraints .",
    "this means that we perform the dirac quantization for constrained systems .",
    "after that , the constraints are solved quantum mechanically with a care of the operator ordering .",
    "the same route has been traced by many people who tried to describe the spontaneous symmetry breaking of simple scalar systems @xcite .",
    "calculation of the dirac brackets in our system is a very complicated task .",

    "( the spinors @xmath96 are independent of mass .",

    "this undesirable situation is known as one of the pathological properties of the lf formalism which needs great care for obtaining correct results @xcite .",
    "indeed , as we will see later , to remedy this problem is indispensable to get a meaningful gap equation . in many cases , loss of mass information",
    "is cured by a carefully chosen infrared regularization .",
    "it should also be commented that the mass - information loss is certainly not a desirable feature , but we will find its usefulness in describing the broken phase physics .",
    "anyway , we must pay great attention to the fact that naive mode expansion of the ( scalar and fermion ) fields is independent of the value of mass .",
    "the fock vacuum @xmath101 is defined by @xmath102 for @xmath103 .",

    "let us comment on the problem of operator ordering and clarify our stance toward it . since the ( zero - mode and fermionic ) constraint equations are generally nonlinear relations among operators , their solutions depend on operator ordering .",
    "we must select an appropriate operator ordering .",
    "then , what can be the criterion for this problem ?",
    "in many papers discussing the spontaneous symmetry breaking in dlcq , the weyl ordering is adopted on general grounds .",
    "however , it is not clear whether the weyl ordering in constraint equations makes sense because they include both independent and dependent variables .",
    "the most reliable criterion for determining the operator ordering will be as follows . before solving the constraint equations",
    ", we can calculate the dirac brackets between independent variables and dependent ones ( _ e.g. _ @xmath108=\\cdots$ ] ) , which are terribly complicated in our model and we do not display them in this paper . here",
    "we already have to specify the operator ordering . on the other hand",
    ", we can solve the constraint relations with the above ordering and obtain their solutions such as @xmath109 .",
    "now we can calculate again the commutators between the solutions ( i.e. dependent variables ) and independent variables ( _ e.g. _ @xmath110 $ ] ) using simple commutators eqs .",
    "( [ raa ] ) and ( [ rab ] ) .",
    "the results should be identical with those of the dirac bracket .",
    "in other words , we must find out such operator ordering that will give a consistent result in the above sense .",
    "this should be the criterion for an appropriate operator ordering .",
    "however , as you expect , to find such ordering in our model is an extremely difficult task .",
    "so practically , we just work with several particular orderings and compare the results . in our actual calculations ,",
    "we treat two specific orderings and check whether the results depend on the ordering or not . to find a consistent operator ordering",
    "should be examined in much simpler models .    in the following",
    ", we will solve the zero - mode constraints in two different ways : perturbative and non - perturbative methods . to solve",
    "the constraint is significant to describe the symmetry breaking on the lf . to see this ,",
    "let us decompose the longitudinal zero modes into c - number parts and normal - ordered operator parts , @xmath111 if the c - number part of the solution is nonvanishing , it directly means nonzero condensate : @xmath112 and @xmath113 . therefore to find such nontrivial solution is necessary to describe the symmetry breaking .",
    "we explicitly demonstrate that perturbative solutions can not lead to chiral symmetry breaking while nonperturbative solutions give nonzero vacuum expectation value for @xmath0 . in both cases , the fermionic constraint is formally solved ( as in eq .",

    "we regard @xmath115 as a critical coupling of the symmetry breaking which will be determined later .",

    "both become nonzero due to nonzero bare mass @xmath73 , but we have to calculate fermion s one loop to obtain the physical pion mass @xmath251 .",
    "we have studied a method of describing the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking on the lf .",
    "our description is based on the idea in dlcq that the symmetry breaking is achieved by solving the `` zero - mode constraints '' , which already succeeded to some extent in describing the spontaneous symmetry breaking in simple scalar models .",
    "the point is that we can utilize this idea even for the dynamical symmetry breaking in fermionic systems if we introduce bosonic auxiliary fields for @xmath38 and @xmath312 , and treat them as dynamical variables by adding their kinetic terms .",
    "then the problem can be formulated such that we find a nontrivial solution to the `` zero - mode constraint '' .",
    "we exemplified this idea in the njl model .",
    "the model we studied is the chiral yukawa model , which reproduces the njl model in the infinitely heavy mass limit of the scalars . within this model",
    ", we showed in the massless case the equivalence between `` light - front '' chiral transformation and the usual one by classically solving the three ( i.e. two zero - mode and one fermionic ) constraints .",
    "this allowed us to construct the chiral current @xmath313 and charge @xmath4 .",
    "even if we solve the constraints classically , the resulting theory can not have a symmetry breaking term .",
    "quantum analysis showed that the zero - mode constraint for a scalar boson @xmath0 became the gap equation in nonperturbative treatment , which lead to nonzero condensate @xmath314 and equivalently to the chiral symmetry breakdown .",
    "we found the critical coupling @xmath115 beyond which the fermion acquires nonzero dynamical mass . on the other hand",
    ", a perturbative solution could not give fermion condensate even in the quantum theory .",
    "the most important key of our description was the identification of the zero - mode constraint of @xmath0 with the gap equation .",
    "this was suffered from a severe problem that the correct mass dependence disappears from the mode expansion .",
    "of course this is a demerit of the lf formalism and we have to carefully incorporate mass dependence into e.g. @xmath315 when we regularize its infrared divergence .",
    "it is suggestive that cutoff schemes with symmetry consideration such as parity or rotational invariance lead to physically acceptable results .",
    "contrary to such negative aspects , the mass - information loss has a useful and important aspect .",
    "it follows that the fock vacuum keeps invariant even if we change the value of mass .",
    "therefore the vacuum does not change even though symmetry breaking occurs and the fermion acquires dynamical mass .    in our formalism ,",
    "_ the vacuum is exactly the fock vacuum_. the inclusion of _ dynamical _ scalar fields was necessary to clarify the structure of the hilbert space and the triviality of the vacuum .",
    "the way of realizing broken phase is that the vacuum is still trivial but the operator structure of the _ dependent _ variables changes . in other words , the `` vacuum physics '' in conventional formulation",
    "is converted into the hamiltonian through the dependent variables .",
    "the zero modes of scalars and the bad component @xmath34 are constrained variables and differently expressed by physical variables depending on the phases .",
    "related to this , the lf chiral transformation of the dependent variables also becomes unusual in the broken phase .",
    "consequently , a seemingly contradiction between the triviality of the null - plane charge @xmath192 and the chiral condensate @xmath316 is resolved .",
    "we further calculated masses of @xmath5 and @xmath0 for both symmetric and broken phases . in the broken phase",
    ", the mass of @xmath5 goes to zero in the chiral limit , which is consistent with the ng theorem .",
    "our result is consistent with the gor relation .",
    "if we substitute symmetric solution into the lagrangian , there appear tachyon modes for @xmath222 .",
    "therefore we can say that when @xmath222 , physically realized phase is the broken phase .",
    "certainly we have massless pion in the model , but it is very difficult to verify the ng theorem in general on the lf .",
    "this is because we have nonlocal interaction and because the chiral transformation of the full fields explicitly depends on the model .",
    "both of these arise from the fact that in the lf formalism the bad component of fermion and zero modes of scalars are constrained variables .",
    "however , we have succeeded in deriving the pcac relation .",
    "this was enabled by utilizing the current @xmath186 which was the noether current defined for the massless fermion .",
    "the massive current @xmath283 becomes complicated and it is almost hopeless to deal with it .",
    "the physics meaning of this discrepancy between @xmath186 and @xmath283 is still not clear but it seems that the usual current @xmath186 is favorable for discussing the `` usual '' chiral symmetry ( not the `` lf '' chiral symmetry ) .",
    "one of the most important conclusion of our analysis is the nonconservation of the lf chiral charge @xmath4 .",
    "this can be shown both by direct calculation of @xmath317 $ ] using the unusual chiral transformation law and by utilizing the pcac relation . in the broken phase , the chiral charge",
    "@xmath4 does not conserve @xmath297 even in the chiral limit .",
    "the singular behavior @xmath318 of the pion zero mode is essential to give a finite violation of @xmath297 .    in our calculation ,",
    "`` nonperturbative '' implied the mean - field approximation .",
    "this mean - field calculation is justified as the leading order approximation in the @xmath22 expansion . in principle",
    ", we can develop a systematic @xmath22 expansion to go beyond the mean - field result .",
    "nevertheless , the higher order will severely depend on the operator ordering and it is not clear whether the result with our specific ordering makes sense . if we want to go beyond the leading order , we have to determine the consistent operator ordering according to the criterion discussed in the text .",
    "since this is a very difficult task in our model , it should be examined in much simpler models such as 1 + 1 dimensional yukawa theory .",
    "it will be challenging to use other nonperturbative method to solve the zero - mode constraint .",
    "for example , tamm - dancoff approximation which truncates the fock space into a few particle states will give some nontrivial results .",
    "notice that our leading @xmath22 approximation corresponds to the two body truncation since multiquark states give higher order contribution .",
    "our method here heavily relies on the introduction of auxiliary fields .",
    "so it seems natural to ask a question : can we describe the chiral symmetry breaking without introducing the auxiliary fields ?",
    "the answer is of course yes . even though we do not have zero mode constraints , it is possible to describe the chiral symmetry breaking on the lf .",
    "its explicit demonstration in the purely fermionic njl model will be given in our next paper @xcite .",
    "as far as the njl model is concerned , to solve the fermionic constraint becomes of great importance .",
    "there still remain many problems which can not be discussed in our model .",
    "one of them is the issue of renormalization . in a renormalizable theory ,",
    "if one introduces an infrared cutoff and excludes the zero mode degrees of freedom from the beginning , then the `` vacuum physics '' should be discussed as the problem of renormalization with nonperturbative infrared counter terms .",
    "relation between such counter term approach @xcite and the zero - mode approach presented here is not clear .",
    "we need further investigation for understanding how to describe the chiral symmetry breaking in lfqcd .",
    "the authors acknowledge w. bentz for discussions on the cutoff scheme .",
    "one of them ( k.i . ) is thankful to k. yazaki and k. yamawaki for useful discussions and to members of yukawa institute for theoretical physics where most of the work was done . the other author ( s.m . )",
    "is grateful to the members of saturday meeting ( doyo - kai ) for stimulating discussions .",
    "effective potential for scalars in the chiral yukawa model ( [ aa ] ) is easily calculated in the leading order of @xmath22 expansion @xcite . exactly in the same way as in the gross - neveu model @xcite , we find that the leading contribution comes from the fermion one - loop diagrams .",
    "note that the inclusion of kinetic terms for scalars has no effect on the leading effective potential .",
    "since the scalar propagator is @xmath181 , effects of the kinetic term ( i.e. @xmath16 dependence ) emerges from the next leading order .",

    "consistency conditions for @xmath346 and @xmath347 ( @xmath348 is a conjugate momenta of @xmath349 ) generate the zero - mode constraints ( [ acc ] ) , while @xmath350 generates the fermionic constraint ( [ acaa ] ) .",

    "<S> dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in the dlcq method is investigated in detail using a chiral yukawa model closely related to the nambu - jona - lasinio model . by classically solving three constraints characteristic of the light - front formalism , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the chiral transformation defined on the light front is equivalent to the usual one when bare mass is absent . </S>",
    "<S> a quantum analysis demonstrates that a nonperturbative mean - field solution to the `` zero - mode constraint '' for a scalar boson @xmath0 can develop a nonzero condensate @xmath1 while a perturbative solution can not . </S>",
    "<S> this description is due to our identification of the `` zero - mode constraint '' with the gap equation . </S>",
    "<S> the mean - field calculation clarifies unusual chiral transformation properties of fermionic field , which resolves a seemingly inconsistency between triviality of the null - plane chiral charge @xmath2 and nonzero condensate @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculate masses of scalar and pseudoscalar bosons for both symmetric and broken phases , and eventually derive the pcac relation and nonconservation of @xmath4 in the broken phase . </S>"
