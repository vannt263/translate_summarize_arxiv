    "brws have been extensively studied in the past few year for classical wavelength conversions @xcite and entangled photon pair generations @xcite .",
    "the two distinct guiding mechanisms involved provide a great design flexibility in achieving phase matching near the bandgap of semiconductors where formidable material dispersion exists , as well as in generating photon pairs with particulate quantum properties , such as entanglement @xcite and spectral separability @xcite .    of particular interest to this work",
    ", it was proposed that dispersion engineered brws with zero group velocity mismatch ( gvm ) between photons in a pair can generate ultra - broad band wavelength multiplexed polarization entangled photons @xcite . however , even without any waveguide dispersion engineering which sacrifices the generation efficiency , cross - polarized photon pairs generated via a type - ii spdc process in a brw showed inherent polarization entanglement without any off - chip compensation , usually required to remove the walk - off between photons in a pair , due to the lack of material birefringence @xcite .",
    "as such , it can be expected that the photon pairs have a much broader bandwidth than a typical type - ii process in birefringent materials because the bandwidth is largely determined by the gvm between photons in a pair .",
    "we consider the same brw demonstrated for polarization entanglement generation in @xcite , with the detailed structure described in methods . for a 1.09 mm long waveguide in this work , the simulated spectra for the horizontal ( h ) and vertical ( v ) polarized down - converted photons using a cw pump",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] .",
    "the spectrally overlapped region of the two polarizations has a fwhm of @xmath195 nm , which is considerably wider than that of a typical type - ii process in a birefringence material .",
    "now consider the experiment that a dwdm filter is used after the waveguide to deterministically separate the down - converted photons into many wavelength channel pairs , as schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic_setup ] .",
    "the output two - photon state of each channel pair is given by @xmath2\\left\\vert vac\\right\\rangle , \\label{eq : state}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 , @xmath4 represent the signal , idler channel frequencies ; @xmath5 , @xmath6 are the associated join spectral amplitudes that the signal photon is vertically ( v ) polarized and idler photon is horizontally ( h ) polarized , and vice versa .",
    "the integration is performed over the channel pair transmission bands @xmath7 of the dwdm .",
    "the state given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : state ] ) is maximally entangled in polarization , as long as the spectral - temporal indistinguishability is satisfied in the two term on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ eq : state ] ) . according to fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] , the spectral intensities of h and v photons are almost identical near degeneracy . in addition , the temporal walk - off between the two polarizations due to modal birefringence is negligible comparing to the photon coherence time . as a result , high degree of entanglement can be achieved for channel pairs near the degenerate wavelength .        assuming a typical 55 ghz ( 0.44 nm ) channel bandwidth and 100 ghz ( 0.8 nm ) channel separation for the dwdm , the calculated concurrence @xcite , an entanglement monotone , as a function of signal and idler wavelengths , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : concurrence_vs_wavelength ] . according to fig .",
    "[ fig : concurrence_vs_wavelength ] , the concurrence is almost 1 near the degenerate wavelength , indicating a maximal degree of entanglement . a concurrence of at least @xmath8 , the minimal value that guarantees clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequality violation @xcite , could be generated within a range of @xmath1118 nm of wavelength .",
    "this corresponds to over 70 pairs of frequency channels . as a result ,",
    "this brw chip can generate over 70 channel pairs of polarization entangled photons directly , with a concurrence of at least 0.71 in the ideal case .",
    "the bandwidth is limited by the residual form birefringence of the waveguide .",
    "to further increase the bandwidth , one strategy is to cancel the gvm between the cross - polarized down - converted photons via dispersion engineering , as suggested in @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the bandwidth can be increased by tapering the waveguide , which creates a gradient of phase mismatch along the direction of propagation , in a close analogy to chirping in quasi - phase matching ( qpm ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , ultrabroadband polarization entanglement can be achieved in brws via concurrent type-0 and type - i spdc processes @xcite .",
    "in such a case , co - polarized photons in a pair naturally exhibit broader spectral bandwidths than in a type - ii process .      to demonstrate the theoretical predictions",

    "a high value of concurrence of at least @xmath12 and as high as @xmath13 , as well as a highest fidelity of 0.97 to a maximally entangled state @xmath11 could be observed for the signal - idler pairs from 1535.4 nm to 1575.6 nm , which approximately covers the whole c - band ( 1530 nm-1565 nm ) .",

    "the fitted curves , without accidental subtraction , show visibilities of 97.3% and 94.5% in the h basis , and 90.1% and 87.5% in the d basis , respectively .",
    "in summary , we demonstrated the generation of broadband wavelength multiplexed polarization entangled photons directly from a monolithic waveguide chip for the first time . with a minimal concurrence of 0.77 , polarization entanglement was demonstrated in a bandwidth of 95 nm . in particular , for over 40 nm near the degenerate wavelength , high quality polarization entangled photons with a minimal concurrence of 0.96 and as high as 0.98 can be achieved .",
    "in addition , the degree of entanglement demonstrated in this work is the highest reported among all monolithic waveguide sources to the best of our knowledge .",
    "the performance of the source can be improved by better device fabrications that decrease waveguide losses . as predicted in @xcite",
    ", the generation rate can be increased by orders of magnitude in a lossless waveguide .",
    "this will allow one to afford using a dwdm with a narrower channel bandwidth and closer channel separation .",
    "the degree of entanglement can be improved due to the increased spectral - temporal indistinguishability . on the other hand , the entanglement bandwidth could be increased via dispersion engineering , tapering , or by utilizing concurrent type-0 and type - i processes , as mentioned before .    comparing with existing techniques for generating broadband wavelength",
    "multiplexed entangled photons , this method requires no interferometry , and thus greatly reduced the source complexity .",
    "such a chip form - factor is essential for real life applications of entangled photons .",
    "in addition , based on a iii - v semiconductor platform , we can envisage the integration of its own electrically pumped laser and passive components such as an array waveguide grating ( awg ) on the same chip , which paves the way for fully integrated sources in quantum information processing and entanglement networks .",
    "the semiconductor wafer was grown on a gaas [ 001 ] substrate using metal  organic chemical vapor deposition ( mocvd ) .",
    "the composite core consists of a 500 nm thick al@xmath16ga@xmath17as sandwiched by a pair of 375 nm al@xmath18ga@xmath19as .",

    "the waveguide used for polarization entanglement measurements has an etch depth of 3.6 @xmath24 m and a ridge width of 4 @xmath24 m .",
    "the propagation losses for the down - converted photons were measured to be @xmath14 @xmath25 .",
    "the sample was mounted on a standard end - fire setup , with the pump from a cw ti : sapphire laser set at te polarization and the degenerate wavelength of 777.86 nm .",
    "a 100@xmath26 objective lens was used to focus the pump beam into the bragg mode of the waveguide .",
    "after the sample , the output light was collected by a 40@xmath26 objective lens and filtered by a few long pass filters to reject the pump , and then coupled into a single mode fiber .",
    "a fiber based dichroic splitter was then subsequently used to deterministically separate paired photons into signal and idler paths according to wavelengths .",
    "one of the paths then subsequently passed through a tunable bandpass filter with a bandwidth set to be 55 ghz .",
    "this can select out paired photons in a given frequency channel pairs .",
    "note that , ideally , an additional bandpass filter should be used in the other path to select the other twin photon in the same pair and suppress the uncorrelated noise photons .",
    "this could significantly reduce the accidental count rate while maintaining a high coincidence . instead",
    ", a commercial dwdm could also be used to replace the filter system used here .",
    "nevertheless , our filters emulates a dwdm in terms of the physics and allows us to explore the maximum bandwidth achievable for the device itself .",
    "photons in the two frequency channels were then launched into free - space for polarization manipulation and analyzing before being detected by a pair of ingaas single photon detectors .",
    "the photons from the narrow frequency channel were detected by a free - running detector ( id220 , i d quantique , 20% quantum efficiency ) , which triggered a gated detector ( id210 , i d quantique , 25% quantum efficiency ) used to detect photons from the wide frequency channel .",
    "an extra length of fiber was connected before the gated detector in order to compensate for the electronic delay between the two detectors .",
    "the detection events from both detectors were then sent to a time - to - amplitude converter ( tac ) ( id800 , i d quantique ) with a timing resolution of @xmath27 ps to record the coincidence histograms .    near the degenerate wavelength",
    ", the peak net coincidence counts for all channels were approximately 350 counts in 20 seconds under an external pump power of 15 mw before the input objective lens .",
    "the pump power and integration time were chosen as a compromise of the coincidence to accidental ( car ) rate and the total measurement time , due to the mechanic instability of the experimental equipment .",

    ", we estimate a generation rate of @xmath9 pairs / s / mw / ghz in terms output photon pairs after the waveguide and internal pump power . for two - photon interference measurements shown in fig .",

    ", a pair of birefringence compensators consisting of a half - wave plate ( hwp ) and a quarter - wave plate ( qwp ) was inserted in each path to partially compensate for the polarization rotation in the fiber , such that a given polarization before the detectors corresponds to the same polarization immediately after the waveguide .",
