    "magnetosphere is a region surrounding a magnetized body , where magnetic effects dominate the motion of electrically charged particles .",
    "astrophysical black holes are electrically neutral and do not support their own magnetic field , nevertheless , they can be endowed by a magnetosphere when embedded in an external magnetic field that is generated by distant currents . unlike planetary magnetospheres ,",
    "black holes bring new quality by influencing the structure of electromagnetic fields directly by their strong gravity @xcite .    near a rotating black hole ,",
    "shearing motions are very intense , and capable of bending and folding magnetic lines frozen into plasma .",
    "this process is known to create conditions suitable for magnetic reconnection @xcite .",
    "but here we conceive a different setting : a magnetically dominated region , where large - scale magnetic fields get distorted by purely gravitational effects caused by proximity of the black hole . as a result of such an interaction ,",
    "a complicated structure arises of narrow magnetic layers and associated neutral points @xcite .",
    "reconnection can then occur when some amount of plasma is brought in the region , e.g.  by the vacuum breakdown and the resulting production of electron - positron pairs .",
    "recently , @xcite investigated the role of motion of a schwarzschild black hole through an ordered magnetic field .",
    "the linear velocity component leads to conditions permitting the energy extraction by an induced electrical field in the direction parallel to the magnetic lines .",
    "the released energy is eventually emitted in the form of an electromagnetic signal .",
    "however , the motion of a magnetized non - rotating black hole does not seem to produce magnetic neutral points .",
    "the formation of such a magnetic topology is an important aspect in the context of magnetic reconnection , which typically takes place where topologically distinct regions approach each other and the magnetic field lines change their connectivity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "various processes can lead to the magnetic topology exhibiting null points , in particular , these can emerge by complex motions of the plasma . in this respect",
    "the black hole rotation brings a new situation , as magnetic field lines become twisted in a highly curved spacetime of a rotating black hole , approximately where the ergosphere forms .",
    "this is caused by gravito - magnetic interaction of general relativity @xcite .",
    "here , we examine the resulting structure of the magnetic field , namely , the emergence of critical points in a local frame of a physical observer , resembling the occurrence of x - points , which were studied , e.g.recently in the context of special - relativistic reconnection @xcite .    in the previous paper @xcite , we considered a special case of a uniform magnetic field in perpendicular orientation with respect to the black hole spin axis , and we demonstrated that magnetic null points can indeed form near a rotating ( kerr ) black hole . here , we identify precise location of the null points and we plot their radial position as a function of spin .",
    "the null point emerges , typically , for @xmath1 and it moves gradually away from the horizon until it crosses the boundary of the ergosphere from an almost extremely rotating black hole .",
    "furthermore , in this paper the embedded magnetic field is allowed a general orientation , i.e. , it can be inclined in an arbitrary angle with respect to the rotation axis .",
    "therefore , axial symmetry is broken between the gravitational and electromagnetic fields , and this has to result in a truly three - dimensional structure of magnetic field lines along with gravito - magnetically induced electric field ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) .",
    "in fact it was not obvious whether the magnetic nulls exist in the oblique case or whether their occurrence is an artifact of special ( perpendicular ) orientation of the magnetic field .",
    "the adopted approach allows us to identify the gravitational effects operating in a magnetically dominated system , where a super - equipartition magnetic field governs the motion of plasma .",
    "we indeed find the null points also in a fully three - dimensional case of an inclined magnetic field .",
    "astrophysical black holes do not support their own intrinsic magnetic field ; this has to be generated by external currents and brought down to horizon by accretion .",
    "an active role of accretion on transporting large - scale magnetic fields toward horizon has been recognized @xcite .",
    "a black hole can also enter a pre - existing magnetic flux tube , and then one asks if the process of magnetic reconnection is influenced by strong gravitational field near horizon . and",
    "does the black hole rotation play a significant role in the scenario of this kind ?    as we wish to discuss magnetic fields inclined with respect to the spin axis , and we also want to include the fast translatory motion , the following picture appears to be appropriate : kerr black hole traversing a `` magnetic filament '' , described as an extended ( largely one - dimensional ) flux tube .",
    "such an idea can be motivated observationally , by highly ordered and elongated arcs ( of about @xmath2 g ) that are seen in galactic center , within a few parsecs from sagittarius a * compact radio source ( sgr  a * ; * ? ? ?",
    "they are thought to represent large - scale magnetic flux tubes that are illuminated by synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons @xcite .    given a limited resolution that can be achieved with current imaging techniques , the magnetic filaments can not be traced down to the characteristic size of the black hole .",
    "cm , where the central black hole mass is expressed in terms of @xmath3 .",
    "the velocity of the keplerian orbital motion of a particle is then @xmath4 .",
    "the corresponding orbital period is @xmath5  s. hereafter , we use a dimensionless form of geometrized units , where all quantities are scaled with the black hole mass ; @xmath6 does not appear in the equations explicitly .",
    "] therefore , the actual mapping of the magnetic structures near black holes is not directly possible ( this may change with new interferometrical techniques in near future ) .",
    "the role of magnetic structures in accelerating the particles is suggestive , especially because they could help us to understand the origin of particle acceleration and the resulting signatures in the electromagnetic signal .",
    "naturally , in astrophysically realistic solutions the role of non - ideal plasma will need be included",
    ". currently , neither of the frequently discussed limits ( i.e. , vacuum vs.  force - free approximations ) are able to account for both the plasma currents as well as the accelerating electric fields .",

    "the case of oblique geometry , however , has been explored only partially @xcite .",
    "this is caused especially by the fact that the off - equatorial fields are lacking any symmetry , and so are more difficult to visualise . also , qualitatively new effects on the field structure were not expected .",
    "nevertheless , in @xcite we were able to demonstrate that the asymptotically perpendicular field lines develop a magnetic neutral point in the equatorial plane .",
    "this is interesting because such structures of the magnetic field are relevant for processes of electromagnetic acceleration .",
    "the magnetic null point emerges in a local physical frame , and could trigger reconnection .",
    "however , the asymptotically perpendicular field is a rather exceptional case .",
    "therefore , here we investigate near - horizon magnetic structures in more detail , also for a general orientation of the magnetic field .    the main objective of this discussion is to track the location of magnetic null points and to explore a complex three - dimensional configuration inside the ergosphere .",
    "we consider the form of magnetic lines together with the induced electric lines for different values of the model parameters : the inclination angle of the asymptotic magnetic field @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) , the black hole spin @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , and the boost velocity @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) .",

    "a fully three - dimensional structure of magnetic lines develops outside the equatorial plane . in figure  [ fig4 ]",
    "we observe a superposition of two essential effects .",
    "firstly , the x - type structure of the magnetic null point persists also outside the equatorial plane . secondly , however , the magnetic lines acquire a growing vertical component @xmath54 @xmath55 , whereas the electric field passes through the magnetic null point and crosses the equatorial plane vertically .",
    "such a structure suggests that particles can be accelerated by the non - vanishing electric field , and they can stream away from the neutral point .",
    "it is interesting to investigate the location of magnetic null points as a function of the black hole spin @xmath9 and velocity @xmath56 of the translatory motion .",
    "this question is especially relevant in the context of the electromagnetic acceleration mechanisms of particles in the vicinity of rapidly rotating black holes ( position of the magnetic null point recedes from the horizon as the spin @xmath9 increases ) .",
    "we would like to identify the site of magnetic reconnection and ask whether it is located outside the ergosphere or inside it , depending on the black hole spin .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig5 ] , where we plot the radial distance of the magnetic null points as a function of spin for different values of the linear ( boost ) velocity @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "orientation of the velocity is set perpendicular to the asymptotic field , @xmath50 , @xmath59 .",
    "this special configuration of a magnetic field ( mutually orthogonal with respect to the drift velocity and the rotation axis ) provides suitable conditions for the emergence of the null points . in the case of extreme",
    "spin we observe the occurrence of null points for velocity as low as @xmath60 . on the other hand",
    ", rapid motion @xmath61 allows the null point formation also for a rather low spin about @xmath62 .",
    "both @xmath9 and @xmath56 parameters are essential to ensure the existence of null points , and they both help to drag the point farther out from the horizon .",
    "a combination of extreme spin @xmath63 and fast motion @xmath61 brings the magnetic null to @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "increasing the velocity beyond this value does not move the neutral point any farther . on the other hand , for small values of spin and/or small velocity the null point",
    "does not show up at all .    figure  [ fig6 ] completes information about the null point location in the equatorial plane .",
    "magnetic field is again specified to be asymptotically perpendicular to the rotation axis ( @xmath50 , @xmath59 ) and the black hole moves transversely with respect to both the magnetic field and the rotation axis ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) .",
    "the view of the equatorial plane in polar coordinates allows us to demonstrate how the magnetic null points move gradually away from the horizon as the spin increases , while they are dragged around the hole by its frame - dragging effect . for high velocity and large spin",
    "the null points emerge just outside the ergosphere boundary , whereas for lower values they are generally confined within the ergosphere .",
    "we also observe that the distance of null points in oblique configurations of the system is generally smaller compared to the perpendicular case shown here , so we conclude that fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows the farthest location to which the magnetic null point can recede from the black hole horizon .    to conclude the discussion of the position of magnetic null points , in figure  [ fig7 ] we explore a general case when the spin of the black hole , the direction of its translatory motion , and the asymptotic magnetic field point all in different arbitrary directions",
    "this case corresponds to the oblique system which lacks any special symmetry . despite that",
    ", it is interesting to note that the magnetic null points again exist near the horizon ( albeit out of the equatorial plane ) .",
    "also in the oblique case , by raising the spin @xmath9 we locate the magnetic null points getting gradually farther away from the horizon ( see figure  [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "the null points can be traced in analogy with those discussed previously in the equatorial case ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) , however , now the shape of the resulting tracks is more distorted and the null points positions are more difficult to find . because locating the null points of the oblique field does not seem to be possible directly from the analytical form of the field components , we have searched the relevant region numerically .",
    "finally , it may be worth reminding the reader that the exact location of magnetic nulls depends on the choice of frame with respect to which we formulate the problem .",
    "we considered a well - motivated physical frame and we checked that the null points occur also , e.g. , in the frame of freely orbiting ( keplerian ) observers , so the effect is relevant for the behaviour of accreted matter .",
    "rotation is an interesting attribute of cosmic black holes @xcite . in principle",
    ", black holes can be spun up close to extreme @xmath0 @xcite . in stellar - mass black holes",
    "the spin is thought to be chiefly natal @xcite , whereas supermassive black holes in galactic cores can adjust their angular momentum by accretion , and the outcome of evolution depends largely on the dominant mode of accretion , during their entire life - time @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the spin is an important characteristic , potentially allowing the efficient acceleration of matter .",
    "we showed that it can be also relevant directly for the onset of magnetic reconnection .",
    "we discussed the structure of electromagnetic test - fields and the layered pattern of current sheets that can be induced by the gravito - magnetic action .",
    "neutral points of the magnetic field suggest that magnetic reconnection can occur . in the case of extreme rotation ,",
    "@xmath0 , the magnetic null points can occur just outside the ergosphere .",
    "we found that the null points exist also in a general ( oblique ) case which lacks any special symmetry between the direction of the magnetic field , velocity of the linear boost of the black hole , and the orientation of the spin axis .",
    "the proposed scenario can be astrophysically relevant in circumstances when the black hole rotates and moves simultaneously across a magnetic flux tube .",
    "the origin of the magnetic flux tube is thought to be in currents flowing in the medium far from the black hole .",
    "we considered the limit of a magnetically dominated system in which the organised magnetic field dictates the motion to plasma ; the opposite limit of a black hole moving through a force - free plasma has been investigated by other authors ( recently , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in this paper we considered an idealised situation , starting from an electro - vacuum solution , assuming fast motion and rotation of the black hole , and embedding it in an asymptotically uniform magnetic field .",
    "future simulations should clarify , whether the astrophysically realistic effects of the moving black hole on the surrounding electromagnetic structure in its immediate neighborhood will be similar to those envisaged here . despite the field - line structure in this paper",
    "being induced purely by the action of frame - dragging , the exact choice of the projection tetrad is not very essential for the existence of magnetic layers .",
    "the choice of the physical frame does affect the presence and the exact location of the magnetic neutral point , and the associated electric field which accelerates charged particles away from the neutral point .",
    "although the exact location of the neutral point varies with the model parameters , it always occurs very close to the black hole , where the frame - dragging is efficient .",
    "therefore , the point of particle acceleration has to be close to horizon as well .",
    "we note that all essential ingredients needed for the aforementioned mechanism to operate are met in standard circumstances that are believed to occur in various cosmic objects .",
    "namely , large scale magnetic fields are frequently observed .",
    "furthermore , binary black holes are expected to exist in some nuclei of galaxies , where they are gravitational bound to each other and perform the orbital motion , while gradually inspiralling inwards ; shortly before the merger , the motion speeds up significantly .",
    "analytical models for this phase are not possible  in general the spacetime structure has to be solved numerically , nevertheless , the magnetic structure of the organised field may arise quite generically in the close vicinity of such fast - moving black holes that are embedded within an external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "magnetic filaments exist in our galactic center and they suggest that the approximation of an asymptotically uniform organised magnetic field is worth investigating in this context .",

    "<S> understanding the mechanisms of particle acceleration from the vicinity of black holes poses a challenge . </S>",
    "<S> electromagnetic effects are thought to be a prime suspect , but details still need an explanation . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , we study a three - dimensional structure of oblique magnetic fields near a rotating black hole in vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> it has been proposed that such a set - up can lead to efficient acceleration when plasma is injected near a magnetic null point . </S>",
    "<S> we focus our attention especially on the magnetic field in the immediate neighborhood of the magnetic null point , which was previously shown to occur in the equatorial plane . by employing the line - integral - convolution ( lic ) method </S>",
    "<S> , we visualize the magnetic field lines and explore the electric lines rising out of the equatorial plane .    </S>",
    "<S> we show the magnetic field structure near the boundary of ergosphere , depending on the spin of the black hole . </S>",
    "<S> electric field develops a non - vanishing component passing through the magnetic null point and ensuring efficient acceleration of charged particles from this particular location near horizon . </S>",
    "<S> we also examine the effect of translatory boost on the field lines . </S>",
    "<S> similarly to the frame - dragging by rotation , the linear motion carries field lines along with the black hole . </S>",
    "<S> position of the magnetic null point recedes from the black hole horizon as the spin parameter increases . for the extreme value of @xmath0 the null point can occur outside the ergosphere </S>"
