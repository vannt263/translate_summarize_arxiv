    "the optical / infrared ( oir ) spectra of black hole ( bh ) low - mass x - ray binaries often show an excess above the standard @xcite accretion disc emission ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . in some cases , the spectrum can be described by a power law of index close to zero ( i.e. @xmath0 ) .",
    "there are three possible candidates that may account for this emission : the irradiated disc @xcite , hot accretion flow @xcite and the jet @xcite .",
    "sometimes the oir fluxes are higher than expected from any candidate alone @xcite , and the complex optical / x - ray cross - correlation functions @xcite support this anticipation , suggesting contribution of two components simultaneously @xcite .",
    "the source of oir emission can not be determined by only using photometric data and some additional information about the oir  x - ray connection , short time - scale variability properties and the long - term spectral variations is required ( see review in @xcite ) .",
    "the latter is particularly important when trying to separate emission of different components .",
    "the entire transition of the bh transient xte  j1550564  from the hard to the soft state and back during its 2000 outburst was monitored by yale 1 m telescope at ctio in the @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 filters @xcite .",
    "the light - curve structure can not be simply explained by the fast rise - exponential decay pattern , expected in the case of standard or irradiated disc .",
    "an additional component , manifesting itself through strong flares , is required .",
    "recently , @xcite suggested that this component originates in a radio - emitting jet ; however , multiple errors in these works make this interpretation doubtful .",
    "here , we re - analyse the available oir and x - ray data .",
    "from the characteristic decay time - scales in the x - rays and in different oir filters , we infer the typical accretion disc temperature during the soft state .",
    "this immediately translates to the constraints on the extinction towards the source , poorly known before . using the oir light curves",
    ", we accurately extract the non - disc non - thermal component and show evolution of its spectral shape during the flare .",
    "we find that the additional component may originate in the hot accretion flow , if a small fraction of energy is injected in the form of non - thermal electrons that emit synchrotron radiation .",

    "the bolometric luminosity at the peak of the 2000 outburst was @xmath24  erg  s@xmath5   ( see section  [ sec : oir_xray ] ) . because only photons with energy above 2  kev thermalize efficiently @xcite , we use @xmath25  erg  s@xmath5  and finally get @xmath26  k. the temperature can be lower",
    "if the x - rays are so strongly anisotropic that the flux directed towards the outer disc is significantly lower than that at the observed inclination of @xmath27 .",
    "however , if the outer disc is inclined at a similar angle of @xmath28 @xcite , practically no difference is expected .",
    "further constraints are coming from the comparison of the decay rates in the x - ray and optical bands @xcite .",
    "the general idea is to compare the derivative of the observed flux over temperature to that of the known function  a simple blackbody or the irradiated disc model spectrum .",
    "because the decay rate is an injective ( i.e. one - to - one ) function of temperature , we immediately obtain the absolute value of @xmath29 .",
    "if we ignore energy dissipation intrinsic to the disc ( which is possible for high x - ray luminosities ) , the effective temperature of the irradiated disc varies with the x - ray luminosity as @xmath30 .",
    "some deviations from this law are possible if the emission pattern is changing .",
    "because the x - ray light curve shows some flares at the transition from the soft to the intermediate state , we have selected the soft - state segment of the data ( red squares in fig .",
    "[ fig_xrays_lc ] ) and fitted the x - ray flux there with an exponential profile .",
    "we obtain the e - folding time of @xmath31  d. this translates to the time of temperature decay @xmath32  d , i.e. : @xmath33 we then fit the soft- and intermediate - state oir light curves together with the values in the quiescence at mjd 5164551650 with a constant plus an exponentially decaying component . for @xmath2 filter , we adopt the constant @xmath34 in quiescence taken from the earlier observations @xcite .",

    "the decay of the blackbody flux due to the decreasing temperature can be computed as @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the wavelength in microns and @xmath43 . the value for the logarithmic derivative is then obtained by dividing equation  ( [ eq : bt_obs ] ) by equation  ( [ eq : tefft_obs ] ) . solving the resulting equation for @xmath29",

    "we checked the possibility of neglecting the constant flux in the oir light - curves , which resulted in the decay times for the @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46  d , respectively .",
    "these values translate to the temperatures 23200 and 27400  k for @xmath1 and @xmath2 filters and for the @xmath3 filter temperature exceeds 200000k .",
    "if instead only the soft state light curve is fitted with the exponential , we get @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49  d , which correspond to @xmath29 in excess of 40000 k for @xmath1 and @xmath2 filters and again no solution is possible for the @xmath3 filter .",
    "we also checked , whether the irradiated disc model gives any improvement compared to the simple blackbody . in this case equation  ( [ eq : bt_theor ] )",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath50 ^ 2 } x { { \\rm d}}x } { \\displaystyle \\int_{r_{\\rm io}}^1 \\frac{x\\ { { \\rm d}}x}{\\exp(y_{\\rm o}x^\\beta)-1}},\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the power - law index of the radial temperature dependence @xmath52 , @xmath53 is the ratio of the inner to outer disc radius and @xmath54 . in rayleigh ",

    "hence , the simple irradiated disc does not give a good description to the shape of the light curve .",
    "we conclude here that from the simple estimate of the maximum disc size and peak x - ray luminosity , the outer disc temperature has to be above 11000 k in the soft and intermediate states , while from the light curve behaviour we get @xmath60  k. thus we conservatively assume that @xmath61  k during the peak of the 2000 outburst .",

    "the x - ray hardness during the moments of appearance / disappearance of this component was nearly the same ( see fig .  [ fig_xrays_lc]c ) , corresponding to the x - ray spectrum with photon index @xmath117 and reflection amplitude @xmath118 .",
    "an interesting additional detail is a hook - like evolution ( marked by blue arrows ) at the end of the hard state , before the flare in the @xmath3 filter .",
    "this feature arises because several data points at the beginning of the hard state are redder at lower @xmath2 flux compared to the data points a few days later , which makes the spectrum bluer ( larger @xmath119 ) at a higher @xmath120flux .",

    "the spectral index @xmath119 ( upper @xmath109-axis ) at the peak of the flare ( when the spectrum is softest in the hard state ) is identical to @xmath121 , implying a single power - law component going through all three filters .",
    "we note that taking larger values of extinction results in a larger @xmath110 ( harder spectra ) , but the effect is larger for @xmath121 than for @xmath119 , thus the spectrum would no longer be described by a single power law .",

    "the extrapolation of the standard cold accretion disc diskbb spectrum to lower energies reveals that it can not contribute more than a few percent to the observed oir flux , which is dominated by the reprocessed radiation from the outer disc with the total ( unabsorbed ) luminosity of @xmath132  erg  s@xmath5 .",
    "this has to be compared to the total ( unabsorbed ) x - ray luminosity in the 0.011000 kev band of @xmath133  erg  s@xmath5 .",
    "assuming the same angular dependence of radiation for both components , the ratio of luminosities gives the total reprocessing efficiency of @xmath134 .",
    "the intermediate - state spectrum ( on mjd  51676 ) is nearly identical to the soft - state spectrum , with a slightly lower temperatures and the x - ray and outer disc luminosities of @xmath135  erg  s@xmath5  and @xmath136  erg  s@xmath5 , respectively , giving nearly the same reprocessing efficiency of @xmath137 .    in the hard state",
    ", we used the cutoff power - law model with compton reflection ( pexrav model in xspec ; @xcite ) for modelling and estimating the luminosities , because there are no any signatures of the thermal emission from the standard accretion disc in the x - ray band .",
    "we assumed a cutoff at 200 kev which is typical for a bh x - ray binary . during the three considered days ( mjd 51688 , 51697 and 51706 ) , the spectral shape varied very little , with the power - law photon index being nearly identical at @xmath138 ( i.e. @xmath139 ) and the reflection amplitude @xmath140 decreasing from about unity to 0.3 .",
    "the x - ray luminosity took the values of @xmath141  erg  s@xmath5 . the x - ray spectrum taken on mjd  51697 extrapolated to the oir band",

    "in addition to the flare component , the emission from the irradiated disc ( not shown in fig .  [ fig_sed_broad_nufnu ] )",
    "was also steadily declining with @xmath142  erg  s@xmath5  at the same three dates .",
    "this gives the reprocessing efficiency of @xmath143 .",
    "thus we see a clear trend of increasing @xmath144 with decreasing x - ray luminosity .",
    "this trend has also been reported for other bh transients ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . there could be at least two reason for such a change .",
    "first , the geometry of the accretion disc and therefore the emission pattern changes during the sh transition . in the soft state ,",
    "the emission from optically thick standard disc is beamed perpendicular to its plane , hence the outer disc sees less radiation than the observer at 75  inclination . in the hard state , however , the emission from optically thin hot disc is much more isotropic ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "secondly , the reprocessing efficiency is higher for harder spectra , because the soft x - rays are absorbed in the very surface layers producing mostly uv lines and recombination continua ( @xcite ; see also discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "we can account for the second effect by dividing @xmath145 by the luminosity above 2 kev , getting the reprocessing efficiency of @xmath146 and @xmath147 in the soft and intermediate states , respectively , and @xmath148 in the hard state .",
    "this reprocessing efficiency is still rather modest because for the disc half - opening angle of 12  @xcite we expect @xmath149 assuming albedo of 0.3",
    ". the observed reprocessing efficiency can actually be even lower , because at low fluxes a significant fraction of the oir radiation can be produced by the ( ignored here ) secondary star and/or the bulge located at the impact point of the accretion stream .",
    "the non - thermal oir component seen in xte  j1550564  was attributed to the jet synchrotron emission in a number of works @xcite .",
    "the aforementioned works used the optical data , originally published in @xcite , the same as used in this work . @xcite",
    "obtained optical @xmath122 spectral index @xmath150 ( assuming @xmath151 ) on 2000 june 1 ( mjd 51697 ) , in contrast to the obtained by us the flare spectral index @xmath152 ( for @xmath104 ) .",
    "the source of discrepancy is the extinction value , poorly known at that time .    the studies by @xcite present the separation of the non - thermal emission using the light - curve fitting method .",
    "they claimed that the spectral indices of the non - thermal component are in the range @xmath153 , again suggesting the non - thermal optically thin jet emission .",
    "however , these works suffer from the major errors in formulae for transformation of the colours to indices ( see section  [ sec : av_colour ] ) .",
    "furthermore , their fits to the disc light curve in @xmath1 and @xmath2 filters are significantly above the data points just before the flare ( see fig",
    ". 2 in @xcite ) leading to overestimation of the disc contribution and to over - subtraction of the flux in those filters resulting in a much too soft flare spectrum .",
    "these flawed fits have greatly affected the first few points of the flare , where the non - thermal @xmath1 flux was small , hence only spectral hardening during the flare was detected , while we obtain that the flare starts with hard spectrum with @xmath154 , which softens to @xmath155 and then hardens again ( see fig .  [ fig_oir_cmd ] ) .",
    "such behaviour is clearly inconsistent with the optically thin jet spectrum .",
    "the jet radio emission was indeed optically thin in the soft state , with @xmath156 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_sed_radio_oir ] ) , but it does not contribute at all to the oir spectrum , which was consistent with the blackbody .    on the other hand , the radio emission in the hard state close to the peak of the second flare , on mjd  51697.14 was optically thick with @xmath157 @xcite",
    ". however , the oir flare spectrum has a different slope and does not lie on the continuation of the radio spectrum ( see green points in fig .",
    "[ fig_sed_radio_oir ] ) .",
    "connecting those requires a break in the spectrum in the far - ir , which is inconsistent with the simplest jet models where main parameters follow the power - law radial dependences with constant indices @xcite .",
    "the strongest arguments against the jet contribution to the oir , however , come from the rather hard oir spectra of the flare .",
    "first , the hook - like behaviour on the @xmath116 cmd at the beginning of the flare ( fig .",
    "[ fig_oir_cmd]b ) , a broken power - law flare spectrum which hardens towards red on mjd  51688 ( greed solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig_spe_all ] ) as well as the hard flare spectrum with @xmath158 in the end of the intermediate state ( see section  [ sect : vvi ] and fig .",
    "[ fig_oir_cmd]c ) are not consistent with the jet spectrum extending from radio to the oir band .",
    "secondly , later in the hard state , the flare spectrum has @xmath159 .",
    "if it were optically thick jet emission , the radio flux would be about five orders of magnitude below what was observed just a few days before .",
    "we find this highly improbable .",
    "furthermore , it is difficult to understand how a substantial decrease in the accretion rate could lead to formation of the outflow which is optically thick up to the oir band .",
    "the weakness of the jet in the oir band also implies that the jet can not possibly contribute to the x - rays .",
    "oir flares were observed in a number of bh x - ray binaries .",
    "it was noticed that the beginning of the flare nearly coincides with the radio brightening @xcite .",
    "we find that the position of xte  j1550564  at the x - ray hardness ",
    "flux diagram at the times of quenching / recovery of the oir non - thermal component ( see fig .  [ fig_xrays_lc]c ) closely resembles the ` jet line ' @xcite .",
    "this coincidence can be interpreted in two alternative ways : ( i ) both oir and radio emission originate from one component ( jet ) , or ( ii ) both are causally connected , but originate in different places . as we showed above",
    ", the first interpretation is at odds with the spectral evolution of the oir flare . in the second interpretation",
    ", the oir flare may originate in the geometrically thick hot flow ( see below ) , while the radio is produced in the jet .",
    "the coincidence can be interpreted as a simultaneous appearance of the hot flow and the jet .",
    "this is indeed expected as in modern mhd simulations the jet seems to form only if there is collimation by a geometrically thick accretion flow . in the soft state ,",
    "when the cold , geometrically thin disc extends all the way to the innermost stable orbit , the jet is weak .",
    "it was usually assumed that the electrons in the hot flow follow thermal distribution and in that case synchrotron emission in luminous bh x - ray binaries can not possibly be of importance @xcite , because of strong self - absorption . however , even if the flow contains a small , energetically unimportant tail of non - thermal electrons , situation changes dramatically , as the synchrotron luminosity increases by orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "this results in two effects : first , the seed photons for comptonization in the hot flow now can be dominated by the non - thermal synchrotron instead of the cold truncated accretion disc @xcite and , secondly , the synchrotron radiation can dominate the oir emission from the bh @xcite . the range of wavelengths where the hot flow emits is determined by its size : the larger is the truncation radius of the cold accretion disc , the lower is the frequency where synchrotron radiation is still not absorbed .",
    "the self - absorption ( turn - over ) frequency is @xcite @xmath160^{\\frac{2}{p+4 } } \\ \\mbox{hz},\\ ] ] where @xmath161 is the magnetic field strength , @xmath162 is the thomson optical depth of non - thermal electrons and @xmath163 is the slope the electron distribution .    for the radial dependences",
    "@xmath164 and @xmath165 the self - absorption frequency scales as @xmath166/(p+4)}$ ] and the total oir spectrum from a hot flow is composed of contributions of synchrotron peaks ( in partially opaque regime ) coming from different radii .",
    "the hot flow spectrum constitutes a power - law with the spectral index @xcite @xmath167 at frequencies above @xmath168 for the smallest , most compact zone of the accretion disc , the synchrotron spectrum is optically thin with @xmath169 .",
    "if the optical depth of thermal electrons is high enough , thermal comptonization can dominate completely over the optically thin synchrotron , the latter therefore might be invisible in the total spectrum . at frequencies below the self - absorption frequency for the largest , most transparent zone , the spectrum is optically thick with @xmath170 .",
    "below we follow the hybrid hot flow scenario as described in details in @xcite .",
    "we discuss now how it can explain the broad - band spectrum and the features seen in the cmd .",
    "we also discuss what are the implications for the physical parameters in the vicinity of the bh .",
    "the broad - band oir - to - x - ray spectra in the soft and intermediate states are fully consistent with the standard accretion disc with the addition of the emission from non - thermal / hybrid electrons in the hard x - rays and the irradiated disc in the oir band ( see fig .  [ fig_sed_broad_nufnu ] ) .",
    "the x - ray non - thermal emission can presumably be associated with the corona above the accretion disc , as in these states the hot inner flow either is non - existent or very small . because of high luminosity of the standard disc , electron cooling",
    "is dominated by compton scattering , hence the synchrotron component from the corona is negligible .",
    "indeed , there are no any signatures of this emission in the oir band .    in the hard state ,",
    "the whole oir to x - ray spectrum can be explained by a synchrotron self - compton model where the synchrotron emission from non - thermal electrons is comptonized by the thermal population of electrons @xcite . at the beginning of the hard state ( mjd  51688 ) ,",
    "the accretion rate @xmath171 is high , the synchrotron self - absorption frequency of the innermost zone is at @xmath172hz ( corresponding to @xmath173  g and @xmath174 , see equation ( [ eq : turn_over_exact ] ) ) , while @xmath175  hz for the outermost zone of the hot flow resulting in a break to harder spectrum below that frequency .",
    "this explains a fact that the extrapolation of the x - ray power - law overpredicts the oir flux ( solid blue lines in fig .",
    "[ fig_sed_broad_nufnu ] ) .",
    "later in the hard state , during the peak of the oir flare ( on mjd  51697 ) , @xmath171 and therefore @xmath161 and @xmath162 have dropped , the hot flow has grown in size and @xmath176 for both inner- and outermost zones have decreased .",
    "this results in a flat power - law spectrum in the oir band ( see dashed blue lines in fig .",
    "[ fig_sed_broad_nufnu ] and the sh transition in fig .",
    "[ fig_sed_scheme ] for a schematic presentation of the spectral evolution ) .",
    "because at lower @xmath171 the total optical depth has likely decreased , the synchrotron peak became more pronounced .",
    "later in the hard state ( on mjd  51706 ; dotted blue lines in fig .",
    "[ fig_sed_broad_nufnu ] ) , when the optical depth in the hot flow drops further , the oir / x - ray spectrum can not be represented by a broken power law any longer . instead",
    ", it seems that there are two bumps in the oir and the x - rays ( similar to the spectra of blazars ) .",
    "such double - peaked spectra are generally expected in the hot flow scenario at luminosities below a few per cent of the eddington , at low optical depths ( see fig .  6 in @xcite and fig .  5 in @xcite ) .",
    "the oir spectrum of the hot flow constitutes a power law , which extends down to the self - absorption frequency @xmath176 of the outermost parts . during the rising phase of the outburst , the cold accretion disc shrinks , gradually replacing the hot flow at smaller and smaller radii .",
    "thus @xmath176 shifts to higher frequencies ( see fig .  [ fig_sed_scheme ] ) .",
    "once the @xmath176 crosses the @xmath3 filter , the emission at these wavelengths becomes self - absorbed and further , even rather small increase of the transition frequency results in rapid decrease of the @xmath3-flux . at the same time , the @xmath1 filter experiences minor changes , until the @xmath176 reaches it . at the decay phase of the outburst , the cold disc recedes ,",
    "thus the transition frequency moves towards longer wavelengths , and the rapid flux increase in @xmath3 filter occurs .",
    "this behaviour naturally explains the horizontal tracks we see in the cmds ( fig .",
    "[ fig_oir_cmd ] ) .    the @xmath1@xmath2 cmd ( fig .",
    "[ fig_oir_cmd]c ) also shows a nearly horizontal movement but to the left of the blackbody track in the end of the sh transition corresponding to the hardening of the spectrum . this is a natural consequence of the appearance of a hard hot flow component which compensates the decreasing disc flux in the @xmath1 filter but does not contribute much to the @xmath2 filter .",
    "it is interesting to note that the horizontal tracks appear at different luminosities .",
    "these levels correspond to a factor of 1.35 difference in the outer accretion disc temperature , while the x - ray hs and sh transitions occur at luminosities that differ by a factor of 3 .",
    "this is consistent with a simple relation @xmath30 .",
    "thus , the horizontal tracks in the oir cmds and the x - ray hysteresis loop are both manifestation of the same phenomenon .",
    "we finally note that the hot flow emission in the oir band disappears / appears in the intermediate states at the rising and decaying stages of the outburst around mjd  51659 and 51683 , respectively ( see figs  [ fig_oir_cmd]b , c ) , at a similar x - ray hardness ( see fig .  [ fig_xrays_lc]c ) .",
    "this strongly argues in favour of a similar truncation radius of the cold disc at these moments in spite of a factor of three difference in x - ray luminosity .      at the hs transition , when the cold disc truncation radius decreases , hot flow model predicts a quenching of the emission at longer wavelengths before that at shorter wavelengths .",
    "for instance , quenching the emission in the @xmath3 filter results in a rapid colour change at an almost constant @xmath2-magnitude , as indeed seen in the @xmath2 versus @xmath116 cmd ( fig .",
    "[ fig_oir_cmd]b ) . then , quenching of the emission in @xmath2 filter is expected , however , it is more difficult to see in this diagram , because both the magnitude and the colour change , at the same time the thermal emission is increased , partially compensating for the drop in @xmath2 filter .",
    "the behaviour is tentatively seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_oir_cmd](b ) , where the return to the blackbody track goes along the horizontal line ( at constant @xmath2 ) , then the @xmath2 flux also decreases",
    ". however , due to large error bars and small number of data points , the evolution is also consistent with a decrease of the emission in both filters , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the situation is different at the reverse , sh transition . with receding cold disc , the hot flow emission is recovered at shorter wavelengths before longer wavelengths .",
    "we thus expect the evolution to proceed as follows : first , the spectrum follows a cooling blackbody , then the @xmath2 flux increases , thus both colour and magnitude change in the opposite direction ( towards upper left in fig .  [ fig_oir_cmd]b ) , then the @xmath3 flux increases and the horizontal track appears .",
    "such a behaviour is indeed seen as a hook at the @xmath116 cmd .",
    "the rise of the emission in the @xmath2 filter before the @xmath3 filter can not be accounted for by the jet model .",
    "it is thus a good proxy for discriminating between the jet and the hot flow scenario .      when the oir flare becomes visible in the very beginning of the hard state at the decaying stage of the outburst ,",
    "the non - thermal component has spectral index @xmath177 , which is smaller than the value 2.5 corresponding to the self - absorbed spectrum .",
    "this indicates that @xmath176 lies between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 filters .",
    "approximating the hot flow spectrum at these wavelengths with a broken power - law ( see fig .  [ fig_spe_all ] ) , we obtain @xmath178  hz , from which we can infer the hot flow size at this moment of time . using equation  13 of @xcite , which was derived under an assumption of power - law radial dependences of the magnetic field strength and the electron density , we get @xmath179 where @xmath180  cm is the schwarzschild radius of the @xmath181 bh .",
    "this value should be considered as a rough estimate , to be improved by detailed spectral modelling .",
    "we find that the non - thermal spectrum does not stay power - law of one particular spectral index , but is hardening towards the end of the flare .",
    "according to equation ( [ eq : oir_slope ] ) , @xmath110 depends on indices @xmath182 , @xmath51 and @xmath163 .",
    "let us assume that changes in @xmath110 are predominantly caused by changes in the radial distribution of the optical depth , while @xmath51 is fixed at a value of @xmath183 for advective flows @xcite .",
    "for softest @xmath184 and hardest @xmath185 , we obtain a change of @xmath182 from @xmath186 to @xmath187 if we fix @xmath188 ( the precise value has minor effect on the results ) .",
    "the value of @xmath182 for the soft spectrum is similar to that found in adaf flows @xcite , however , the value obtained from the hard spectrum is quite an extreme , as it requires a highly inhomogeneous configuration .",
    "we should remember , however , that here @xmath182 describes the distribution of non - thermal electrons , not their bulk .",
    "thus , high values of @xmath182 might imply that electron acceleration is not efficient at large radii .",
    "if instead we choose to fix @xmath189 , we get @xmath190 for the soft spectrum ( which is close to the standard value in adafs ) , while for the hard spectrum we get @xmath191 , again suggesting an extreme stratification of the magnetic field strength . in reality , the structure of both the magnetic field and the optical depth is likely to change when the accretion rate decreases , with the general trend , apparent from the above exercise , such that the flow becomes more stratified with strong gradients .",
    "we have carefully analysed the oir and x - ray light curves of xte  j1550564 . from the e - folding times in different wavebands",
    ", we obtained the outer accretion disc temperature in excess of 15000  k during the soft / intermediate states .",
    "using this temperature together with the extreme oir colours observed from xte  j1550564 , we put strong constraints on the extinction towards the source , @xmath192 .",
    "this allowed us to relate the observed oir colours to the slopes of the intrinsic spectrum .    during the soft state , the oir spectrum",
    "is well described by the blackbody ( associated with the irradiated disc ) of exponentially decaying temperature and a constant normalization , while during the x - ray state transitions and the hard states , strong non - thermal flares are observed . by interpolating the decaying flux of thermal emission to the hard state",
    ", we have accurately separated the contribution of the flare from the disc .",
    "importantly , the spectrum of the subtracted thermal component was shown to be consistent with the blackbody of the same normalization as before the flare .",
    "we further demonstrated how the spectrum of the non - thermal component evolves . on the decaying phase of the outburst , the flare starts with an apparent break in the spectrum that is harder in the near - ir with @xmath193 .",
    "the spectrum then becomes a power law and softens to @xmath152 at the peak of the flare .",
    "it hardens again as the source fades . in the hybrid hot flow scenario",
    ", this hardening possibly indicates that the electron acceleration is not efficient at large radii at low accretion rates .",
    "the evolution of the spectral shape is consistent with the hot accretion flow scenario , where the size of the flow varies with the accretion rate . in the hard state ,",
    "the flow is large and the oir spectrum constitutes a power law . during the hs transition , the flow collapses and the low - energy spectral cutoff ( corresponding to the synchrotron self - absorption frequency ) moves from the infrared to the uv . in the soft state ,",
    "the hot flow may not exist at all and its non - thermal emission is quenched . at the reverse transition , the cold disc retreats and the hot flow grows in size leading to an increase of the contribution of the non - thermal component from the hot flow to the oir spectrum and strong reddening of the source .",
    "this transition occurs at a lower accretion rate which manifests itself as the hysteresis loop in the x - ray hardness  flux diagram and as different levels of the horizontal tracks in the oir cmds .",
    "we find that quenching and recovery of the hot flow oir emission occurs at about the same x - ray hardness during the intermediate state .",
    "the position of the source at the x - ray hardness ",
    "flux diagram when this happens ( the hot flow line ) seems to coincide with the jet line that marks the presence of the compact radio jet .",
