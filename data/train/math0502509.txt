    "therefore , one can consider the @xmath21-energy metric @xmath22 on the complex plane @xmath0 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , @xmath3 is called _ complete _ if its @xmath21-energy metric @xmath22 is a complete metric on @xmath4 . as the completeness is only defined for orientation preserving @xmath3 , the term _ complete harmonic open embedding _",
    "implies implicitly that the harmonic embedding is orientation preserving .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that for each holomorphic quadratic differential @xmath47 which is not identically zero , there is a complete harmonic open embedding , unique up to conformal transformations , @xmath48 such that the hopf differential of @xmath3 is exactly @xmath30 .",
    "let @xmath30 be a holomorphic quadratic differential on  @xmath0 , which is given in local coordinate  @xmath23 as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is in general a holomorphic function .",
    "for any @xmath51 with @xmath52 , there is a choice of a continuous branch of @xmath53 in a neighborhood  @xmath54 of  @xmath55 .",
    "then for a given base point @xmath56 sufficiently close to @xmath55 , the mapping @xmath57 is univalent in possibly a smaller neighborhood of  @xmath55 in  @xmath54 .",
    "this defines local charts on @xmath58 and determines two measured foliations on  @xmath0 with singularities at the zeros of  @xmath50 .",
    "in particular , the leaves of them are curves given locally by the sets , @xmath59 each @xmath60 and @xmath61 is called a _ horizontal trajectory _ and _ vertical trajectory , _ respectively .",
    "the foliations formed by these curves are called _ horizontal foliation _ and _ vertical foliation _ correspondingly . obviously , the two foliations have orthogonal leaves . furthermore ,",
    "if @xmath51 is a zero of order  @xmath29 of  @xmath50 , then there are  @xmath62 horizontal trajectories , as well as vertical ones , limiting to @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , the horizontal and vertical foliations are in fact _ measured foliations _ with singularities at the zeros of @xmath30 with natural measures given by @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for the definition of measured foliation on riemann surface in the general situation .      for each @xmath30 ,",
    "the leaf space of the measured foliation given by the vertical trajectories has a special 1-dimensional structure called @xmath2-tree @xcite . in this article",

    "critical trajectory_. each connected domain of the complement of all critical vertical trajectories is sometimes called a _ vertical domain _ , which is foliated by non - critical vertical trajectories .",
    "in the particular case of a quadratic differential @xmath67 for a polynomial  @xmath68 of degree  @xmath69 on  @xmath4 , according to the global structural theorem of meromorphic quadratic differentials on compact riemann surfaces @xcite , there are generically @xmath70 vertical domains . among these domains ,",
    "@xmath71  are called _ end domains _ and at most @xmath72  are _ strip domains_. the definition of these two types of domains is given as follows .    for each vertical domain",
    "@xmath73 , a canonical mapping @xmath74 sends @xmath73 one - to - one onto one of the following domains in  @xmath0 ,    1 .",
    "a half plane , in such case @xmath73 is called an _ end domain _ ; 2 .   a vertical strip , @xmath75 , @xmath76 in such case @xmath73",
    "is called a _ strip domain_.    note that the distance on the @xmath20-tree  @xmath66 can be realized in the following way .",
    "let @xmath77 , @xmath78 be two points on  @xmath66 represented by two leaves @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "one may construct a sequence of arcs from @xmath79 to @xmath80 such that each arc lies either in a horizontal trajectory or a vertical one .",
    "the distance  @xmath81 is given by the sum of the lengths of the horizontal arcs .",
    "in particular , if the straight line between @xmath77 and @xmath78 on the @xmath20-tree can be represented by a single horizontal trajectory in an end domain , then @xmath81 equals the @xmath30-length of that horizontal trajectory .",
    "consequently , one can see that the associated @xmath20-tree @xmath66 has @xmath71 infinite edges corresponding to the @xmath71 end domains , at most @xmath72 finite edges corresponding to the strip domains , and with @xmath69 vertices corresponding to the zeros counted with multiplicity .",
    "for the special case that @xmath82 with generic @xmath83 , we see that there are @xmath12 non - degenerate vertices corresponding to the roots of @xmath84 and @xmath85 vertices degenerated to a single vertex corresponding to @xmath86 if @xmath87 .",
    "the tree @xmath66 will further degenerate if @xmath88 is real ; and for @xmath89 , it will completely degenerate to a single vertex .",
    "more precisely , we have    [ lem - tree ] let @xmath66 be the @xmath20-tree associated to the quadratic differential @xmath90dz^2 $ ] , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 .    1 .   if @xmath93 and @xmath94 , then @xmath66 has @xmath12 non - degenerate vertices each incident with two infinite edges _ ; _ and all of these vertices are adjacent to a unique vertex , which is non - degenerate for @xmath95 and degenerate otherwise , by finite edges of equal length given by @xmath96 .",
    "2 .   if @xmath97 and @xmath94 , then @xmath66 has _ 2 _ non - degenerate vertices each incident with two infinite edges _ ; _ and they are connected by a finite edge of length @xmath98 .",
    "3 .   if @xmath92 and @xmath99 , then @xmath66 has a unique vertex incident with @xmath100 infinite edges .    in the case  ( 2 ) ,",
    "if we take the mid - point of the 2 vertices as the center of the @xmath20-tree , then the vertices are in distance @xmath101 to this center .",
    "this is exactly the same value given by the formula in the case  ( 1 ) with @xmath97 .",
    "an illustration is given in figure  1 .",
    "+ figure 1 : @xmath102 from left to right .",
    "if we consider the associated real tree to the leaf space of the measured foliation given by horizontal trajectories instead of vertical ones , we have another @xmath20-tree associated to @xmath30 .",
    "one sees that the same is true for this tree except that the common length of the finite edges becomes latexmath:[$\\pi    imaginary .    by the argument before the lemma , @xmath66 has @xmath100 infinite edges corresponding to the @xmath100 end domains and has @xmath12 non - degenerate vertices . if @xmath93 , then @xmath66 also has a vertex with multiplicity @xmath85 .",
    "so we only need to show that each non - degenerate vertex is incident with two infinite edges and calculate the distance between the non - degenerate vertices and the vertex with multiplicity .    for any @xmath92 ,",
    "let @xmath104 be a @xmath105-root of @xmath106 and @xmath107 be a primitive @xmath105-root of unity .",
    "then the roots of @xmath84 are exactly @xmath108 . for any fixed @xmath109",
    ", there is a wedge with vertex at @xmath86 , containing the path @xmath110 , @xmath111 , but no other zero of @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , one can find a domain @xmath112 containing the path @xmath113 which is contained in a strip domain of @xmath30 . choosing a branch of the natural parameter @xmath114 on @xmath112 and taking limits at @xmath115 and @xmath116",
    ", one sees that @xmath117 this implies that the horizontal @xmath30-distance between the root @xmath118 and @xmath119 is given by @xmath120 .",
    "this proves that , in the @xmath2-tree , the vertices corresponding to the roots of @xmath84 are adjacent to the vertex corresponding to @xmath86 by a finite arc of length @xmath96 if @xmath93 . if @xmath97 , then the same calculation shows that the 2 vertices are connected by a finite arc of length @xmath121 .",
    "therefore , in the case that @xmath93 , the vertex corresponding to @xmath86 with multiplicity @xmath85 already has @xmath12 finite edges incident with the @xmath12 non - degenerate vertices , and hence it is not incident with any other edges of @xmath66 . since there are @xmath100 infinite edges , each of the vertices corresponding to the roots of @xmath84 must be incident with 2 infinite edges .",
    "the case that @xmath97 is trivial , since @xmath86 is not even a critical point of @xmath30 .",
    "finally , by counting the multiplicity of the vertices and the number of edges , we see that there is no other edge of @xmath66 and the proof is completed .",
    "in @xcite , it was shown that the image of an horizontal trajectory far from zeroes is exponentially close to the geodesic connecting the end points in the @xmath30-distance of the trajectory . however",
    ", this is not enough in our discussion about the image of the harmonic map .",
    "in fact , we need to show that the difference between the lengths of the image and the geodesic is actually tending to zero as the @xmath30-distance is going to infinity .",
    "note that we need more than just the ratio tending to  @xmath122 as in proposition  2.2 of @xcite .",

    "<S> for this problem , they showed that , up to isometry , the image of a complete orientation preserving harmonic embedding from the complex plane into the hyperbolic plane is a regular ideal polygon if its hopf differential is given by @xmath27 for some _ real _ number @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first nontrivial example of a family of harmonic maps ( for fixed @xmath29 ) with identical images .    </S>",
    "<S> it is obvious that our result is a generalization of that of shi - tam . </S>",
    "<S> however , the method is quite different . in @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the authors studied the asymptotic behavior of the image of the harmonic maps along euclidean rays to infinity . </S>",
    "<S> our approach adopts more geometric properties of the hopf differential , especially those related to the metric information of the @xmath20-tree associated to the vertical measured foliation of the hopf differential . </S>",
    "<S> the relationship between the asymptotic behavior of harmonic maps and the associated @xmath20-trees has been studied by minsky @xcite and wolf @xcite , independently . in these works , </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotic behavior of a sequence of harmonic maps on a compact surface with energy ( or the norm of the hopf differential ) going to infinity was studied . in our case , instead of a sequence of maps , we are interested in the asymptotic behavior of harmonic maps on a complete noncompact surface as in @xcite . in particular , the asymptotic behavior of the length of the image of a horizontal trajectory near infinity was studied . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , it was shown that the image of a horizontal trajectory is asymptotic to a geodesic ; and the difference between the lengths of this image and the asymptotic geodesic is actually tending to zero as the @xmath30-distance is going to infinity .    </S>",
    "<S> the arrangement of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec - h - tree ] </S>",
    "<S> , we will give a brief description of harmonic maps , its hopf differentials and the geometric information of the @xmath20-trees associated to the hopf differentials . </S>",
    "<S> then we will study the asymptotic behavior of the image of horizontal trajectories in section  [ sec - distance ] . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we prove our main result in section  [ sec - image ] . </S>"
