    "current research on the large scale structure of matter is concerned with two fundamental concepts : halo and void .",
    "the concept of halo applies to the dark matter distribution and is meant to define the basic unit of structure .",
    "therefore , dark matter halos have theoretical rather than observational basis . in particular , the concept of halo is useful in the analysis of @xmath0-body cosmological simulations .",
    "in contrast , the concept of void arose in observations of the galaxy distribution , although , recently , it has also been applied to the dark matter distribution and gained some theoretical basis .    on a more fundamental level",
    ", the principle of scale invariance has been often applied to the study of the large scale structure of matter .",
    "scale invariance is a general symmetry , with applications in various branches of physics and other sciences .",
    "its application in cosmology is old , dating back to hierarchical models of the universe devised before the discovery of general relativity ( mandelbrot , 1977 ) .",
    "it became part of standard cosmology when the analysis of galaxy catalogues proved that the two - point correlation function is a power law on scales of several mpc .",
    "a recent review of various ideas and models in cosmology based on scaling laws is given by jones et al ( 2004 ) .",
    "of particular importance are fractal models ( sylos labini , montuori & pietronero , 1998 ) .",
    "multifractal models ( parisi & frisch , 1985 ; halsey et al , 1986 ) are an improvement of fractal models and were introduced in cosmology by pietronero ( 1987 ) , jones et al ( 1988 ) and balian & schaeffer ( 1988 ) .",
    "multifractal analyses of large - scale structure were initially applied to the distribution of galaxies ( domnguez - tenreiro & martnez , 1989 ; martnez , jones , domnguez - tenreiro & van de weygaert , 1990 ) and later applied to @xmath0-body simulations ( colombi , bouchet & schaeffer , 1992 ; valdarnini , borgani & provenzale , 1992 ; yepes , domnguez - tenreiro & couchman , 1992 ) .",
    "we shall take scale invariance of the dark matter distribution in the _ nonlinear _ regime as our working hypothesis .",
    "this hypothesis leads essentially to a multifractal model ( with transition to homogeneity ) . since the linear regime departs from the initial scale invariance ( harrison - zeldovich spectrum ) , the initial conditions for nonlinear evolution are not scale invariant .",
    "however , the dynamical equations for cold dark matter are scale invariant .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to assume that the dynamics is driven to a scale - invariant attractor that is independent of the initial conditions , as is normal in nonlinear systems .",
    "the power - law form of the galaxy - galaxy correlations can be taken as evidence of scale invariance , although there may be deviations from pure power laws .",
    "in particular , zehavi et al ( 2004 ) find small but systematic deviations in the projected correlation function of a sample from the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "they relate those deviations to the deviations from a power - law correlation function found by jenkins et al ( 1998 ) in @xmath1-cdm simulations . hence",
    ", they interpret them as caused by the transition from a two - halo regime on large scales to a one - halo regime on small scales .",
    "we shall discuss an alternative interpretation at the end of this paper , after we have introduced and explained the multifractal model of halos .",
    "our interpretation is fully consistent with scale invariance .",
    "halo models of large - scale structure are now well developed ( cooray & sheth , 2002 ) .",
    "they assume that the full dark matter distribution is composed of two parts : the dark matter distribution within halos and the distribution of halos themselves .",
    "the matter distribution within halos is considered to be in virial equilibrium .",
    "this inner distribution has received much attention .",
    "usually , it is assumed to be relatively smooth , and it is useful to define the average `` profile '' of a single halo . the first approximation is a power - law profile ( peebles , 1974 ; sheth & jain , 1997 ; murante et al , 1997 ) .",
    "however , more refined profile models involve a crossover between two power laws ( cooray & sheth , 2002 )",
    ".    regarding the distribution of halos , halo centers have been distributed randomly in some models ( peebles , 1974 ; mcclelland & silk , 1977 ; sheth & jain , 1997 ; murante et al , 1997 ) but clustering in the distribution of halos has also been considered ( mo & white , 1996 ; sheth & tormen , 1999 ) .",
    "clustering of halos is to be expected and , in particular , the clustering of halos can be of fractal type .",
    "in fact , a power - law halo profile and a fractal distribution of halos are just two aspects of a new formulation of the multifractal model ( gaite , 2005-a ) . in this formulation ,",
    "a general multifractal is considered as a set of fractal distributions of halos , such that similar halos have a fractal distribution with a given dimension .    however , the separation of the full matter distribution between a distribution within halos and a distribution of halos is not meaningful if the full distribution is scale invariant .",
    "a power - law profile actually prevents one from assigning definite sizes or masses to halos , which must be associated , in principle , with _ point - like _ mass singularities ( gaite , 2005-a ) .",
    "but the dark matter distribution is not scale invariant on ever decreasing scales .",
    "thus , the breaking of scale invariance induces a change in the nature of the matter distribution that allows us to assign halos a definite size .",
    "more in general , we will see that the fine structure intrinsic to mathematical multifractals on ever decreasing scales gives rise to some counter - intuitive and even paradoxical geometrical notions .",
    "some of these notions are relevant to describe the dark matter distribution , in spite of its not being scale invariant on ever decreasing scales .",
    "thus , our definition of halo differs from the usual definition : we understand that a natural definition of halo in a multifractal model with a natural coarse - graining scale assigns halos equal size , namely , the size of that scale . a similar definition , namely , based on a uniform size , was proposed by vergassola et al ( 1994 ) to define a mass function for the structure produced in the adhesion model .",
    "in contrast , the most popular definition of halo is based on the _ spherical collapse _ formalism ( mo & white , 1996 ; sheth & jain , 1997 , cooray & sheth , 2002 ) , and it assumes that halos are given by a density - contrast threshold ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "this definition of halo constitutes the basis for the halo finders that use the `` friends - of - friends '' ( fof ) technique ( davis et al , 1985 ) .",
    "nevertheless , valageas , lacey & schaeffer ( 2000 ) have shown that both choices , namely , halos given by a density condition or equal - size halos , can be considered adequate from a theoretical point of view .",
    "our multifractal model of halos agrees with their conclusion , for its crucial feature is the pattern in which the mass concentrates rather than the division of mass among individual halos , which can be made in various manners . of course , the simplest manner is to take equal - size halos .",
    "the notion of void as basic element of the large scale structure is now well established , but its definition is more imprecise than the definition of halo . the original definition of void as a totally empty region , suitable for the galaxy distribution , is now being replaced with definitions that allow for partial emptiness , after having been admitted that dark matter and even low luminosity galaxies are present in the initial voids .",
    "in fact , recently , shandarin , sheth & sahni ( 2004 ) have defined void as an _ underdense connected _ region , such that voids are complementary to superclusters .",
    "we propose here a definition that is related with the definition of shandarin , sheth & sahni ( 2004 ) , but which hinges on the nonlinear multifractal nature of the distribution , unlike theirs .",
    "we begin with a brief review of of multifractals , focusing on the concept of mass concentrations ( singularities ) and the realization of scale invariance .",
    "we introduce the key concept of multifractal spectrum and , in particular , the bifractal spectrum , as well as the method of calculation of the spectrum from correlation moments .",
    "halos can be identified with singular mass concentrations , with power - law profile , whereas voids can be identified with regular mass depletions .",
    "useful computational notions of halo and void result when we consider a ( natural ) coarse - graining scale .",
    "this leads us to a general study of the coarse - grained probability distribution function and its connection with the lognormal model .",
    "further connection with the press - schechter mass function is also possible .",
    "then we study what implications a multifractal model has for the distribution of halos ( as we have defined them ) .",
    "finally , we test all these notions against cosmological @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "multifractal measures appear frequently in physics .",
    "in particular , they appear frequently as attractors of dynamical systems ( halsey et al , 1986 ; falconer , 2003 ) . in dynamical systems ,",
    "the natural measure of some region represents the portion of time that the system spends in it . for many systems ,",
    "one indeed finds that , at long times , the trajectory is confined to a small region of the available space ( an attractor ) , but the time that it spends in any subregion of it is very variable . in other words ,",
    "the measure is very irregular and this non - uniformity encodes further structure that defines the attractor .",
    "the formation of large scale structure is given by the cosmological newton - poisson equations ( peebles , 1980 ) , which constitute a dynamical system .",
    "therefore , to justify the relevance of multifractal analysis in the description of large scale structure , we may adopt the natural view that this structure is just an attractor of that many - dimensional dynamical system .",
    "or we may argue that we expect a scale - invariant structure , but in which the realization of scale invariance is non - trivial , as in general multifractals . at any rate ,",
    "the final justification must rest on a successful comparison with observational data or results of cosmological simulations .    as said above ,",
    "multifractal measures represent mass distributions spread according to highly irregular patterns , that is , with mass concentrations of very different magnitude ( falconer , 2003 ) .",
    "this magnitude is referred to as `` strength '' and defined by the local dimension @xmath3 ( also called lipschitz - hlder exponent in the mathematical literature ) ; namely , @xmath4}{\\log r } , \\label{a}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 $ ] is the mass in the ball of radius @xmath6 centered on the point @xmath7 .",
    "we also write , informally , @xmath5 \\sim r^{\\a(}\\mbox{\\boldmath{$^x$}}^{)}$ ] .",
    "we only consider points @xmath7 such that @xmath5 $ ] does not vanish for any @xmath8 , to prevent the divergence of @xmath9 .",
    "these points form the _ support _ of the measure .    in a regular mass distribution , @xmath10 ( constant ) .",
    "so a multifractal is a singular mass distribution and its mass concentrations are also called singularities ( of various strengths ) . on the other hand ,",
    "an ordinary self - similar fractal can be considered endowed with a uniform mass distribution over it , such that @xmath11 is the _ constant _ fractal ( hausdorff - besicovitch ) dimension .",
    "thus , in the context of multifractals , ordinary self - similar fractals are called _ monofractals _ ( or _ unifractals _ ) .",
    "full - fledged multifractals possess a range of exponents @xmath3 ( or strenghts ) , namely , @xmath12 .",
    "every set of points in which @xmath3 takes a definite value is a fractal set ( in the sense of having non - trivial fractal dimension ) .",
    "therefore , a multifractal can be considered as a set of fractals containing the various mass concentrations . the _ multifractal spectrum _",
    "@xmath13 is the function that gives the fractal dimension of the set of points with exponent @xmath3 .    regarding multifractal spectra",
    ", we should mention that there are cases in which @xmath3 is not strictly constant but which can not be considered full - fledged multifractals .",
    "an example is a finite number of ( isolated ) concentrations of different strength .",
    "this is a regular distribution except for the finite number of singularities .",
    "it has interest in cosmology , as the basis of the model of randomly - placed power - law halos ( gaite , 2005-a ) .",
    "the locations of these halos may also be correlated , so that the model actually becomes related to the halo model proposed here , as we shall see .      to analyze the structure of multifractals ,",
    "it is useful to introduce the scale - dependent correlation moments @xmath14^{q-1}.   \\label{mq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath15 is the total mass , which we normalize to one . with this normalization",
    ", a multifractal measure can be interpreted as a probability measure .",
    "@xmath16 is the usual _ mass - radius _ relation or two - point correlation integral ( the integral of the two - point correlation function ) .",
    "larger integer values @xmath17 are also employed in the analysis of the large scale matter distribution , but they are increasingly difficult to estimate . in addition , since multifractals are singular non - uniform distributions , integer values of @xmath18 are not sufficient and we have to consider the full set of moments @xmath19 for @xmath20 .",
    "we can then define the function that gives the scaling behaviour of this full set of moments , namely , @xmath21 for well - behaved multifractals , this function determines the multifractal spectrum through a legendre transform ( falconer , 2003 ) : @xmath22\\ , , \\label{leg}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 means the infimum with respect to @xmath18 .",
    "if @xmath24 is differentiable and _ convex _ , the infimum is given by the vanishing of the derivative with respect to @xmath18 , so @xmath25 then , after inverting @xmath26 , one obtains @xmath27 , \\label{mfspec}\\ ] ] which is also convex , namely , @xmath28 .",
    "it is useful to define the quantity @xmath29 , which is constant for a monofractal , and , in general , decreases with @xmath18 .",
    "it turns out that the most important values of @xmath18 are @xmath30 . at @xmath31",
    ", we have @xmath32 . on account",
    "that @xmath33 , the set of singularities with exponent @xmath34 has the largest fractal dimension ( which often corresponds to the measure s support ) .",
    "the value @xmath35 gives the _ entropy dimension _",
    "@xmath36 , for a value of @xmath37 such that @xmath38 .",
    "the corresponding singularity set defines the _ measure s concentrate _ , that is , the set outside of which the measure vanishes .",
    "note that @xmath39 and convexity of @xmath13 imply @xmath40 for any @xmath3 ( with equality at @xmath37 ) .    for a monofractal , it is sufficient to consider the mass - radius relation @xmath16 and its exponent @xmath41 for all @xmath18 . in finite samples from fractals , it is usual to consider the discrete version of the mass - radius relation , namely , the number - radius relation @xmath42 , given by the number of particles in a ball of radius @xmath6 centered on one particle and averaged over every particle ,    in general , the mass - radius relation @xmath16 has exponent @xmath43 .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ mfspec ] ) and the condition @xmath40 , @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "we can interpret these relations as follows .",
    "the multifractal analysis through moments relies on a basic property : only concentrations with _",
    "one _ exponent contribute to one @xmath18-moment , namely , concentrations with the exponent @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , to the mass - radius relation only contribute concentrations with exponent @xmath46 .",
    "these concentrations are distributed in a fractal of dimension @xmath47 .",
    "the exponent @xmath46 is larger than @xmath47 due to the presence of other singularities with different @xmath3 in its neighbourhood .",
    "moreover , since @xmath16 is obtained by averaging over points , this operation further increases the exponent .      the mathematical definition of @xmath18-moments provided by the integral in eq .",
    "( [ mq ] ) may not be convenient for calculations .",
    "therefore , in analogy with the _ box - counting _ method for fractal sets , there is a method for _ coarse multifractal analysis _ ( falconer , 2003 ) : one puts an @xmath48-mesh of cubes in the total volume ( which is itself a large cube ) and considers the mass inside each cube .",
    "then one defines @xmath49 where the sum is over non - empty cubes .",
    "this method is related to the coarse - graining method used in cosmology for finite samples under the name of  counts - in - cells \" ( balian & schaeffer , 1989-a ) : assuming that all the particles have the same mass , the mass is measured by counting particles .",
    "in coarse multifractal analysis , the linear cube size @xmath48 defines a scale that one lets go to zero , eventually . in particular , one lets @xmath50 to define the function @xmath24 according to eq .",
    "( [ tauq ] ) after replacing @xmath6 with @xmath48 . from a mathematical standpoint , the equivalence of both point - centered results , from eq .",
    "( [ mq ] ) , and lattice - based results , from eq.([mq2 ] ) , is not guaranteed and requires a careful analysis ( falconer , 2003 ; harte , 2001 ) .    since every set of points in which @xmath3 takes a definite value is a fractal with dimension @xmath13 , in coarse multifractal analysis , the number of cells with exponent @xmath3 is given by @xmath51 according to the box - counting interpretation of the dimension @xmath13 .",
    "let us mention the alternate description provided by its number - radius relation @xmath52 namely , the average number of cells with exponent @xmath3 in a ball of radius @xmath53 centered on one cell . note that the opposite sign of the exponent in these two numbers is in accord with their being related to @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively , and the equality @xmath56 for a monofractal .    from relation ( [ ncell ] ) , we can obtain the _ mass function _ at scale @xmath48 , namely , the number of cells with mass between @xmath57 and @xmath58 , which is @xmath59 given that @xmath60 , @xmath61    any measurement of positions of objects ( galaxies , etc . )",
    "has to be made with a given precision , which actually defines the _ natural _ cell size for the corresponding observation .",
    "furthermore , a single object at the given resolution may appear as a compound object at a higher resolution .",
    "therefore , coarse multifractal analysis is naturally adapted to this idea of change in the description of a distribution in terms of single objects as the resolution increases . however , let us note that other coarse - graining procedures and , in general , other methods can be employed for multifractal analysis .",
    "in particular , let us point out that halsey et al ( 1986 ) define multifractal analysis by coarse - graining into _ arbitrary _ ( disjoint ) pieces @xmath62 , such that their diameters fulfill @xmath63 . then",
    ", the function @xmath64 for small @xmath48 ( large @xmath0 ) and optimized over @xmath65 , is of order unity only for some value of @xmath66 , for given @xmath18 . in the case of partitioning into an @xmath48-mesh of cubes ,",
    "this definition of @xmath24 coincides with the value given by eq .",
    "( [ mq2 ] ) .      the _ legendre spectrum _ given by eq .",
    "( [ leg ] ) is only an upper bound to the real multifractal spectrum ( falconer , 2003 ) .",
    "nevertheless , for  reasonable \" multifractals they coincide .",
    "however , there is an interesting situation in which there can be a discrepancy , as has been noted by balian and schaeffer ( 1989-b ) . in general , the legendre spectrum ( [ leg ] ) must be _ convex _ ( from above ) , but the real multifractal spectrum needs not be convex .",
    "so the legendre spectrum associated to a non - convex multifractal spectrum is only its _",
    "convex hull_.    for example , let us consider a bifractal , with two exponents @xmath37 and @xmath46 ( balian and schaeffer , 1989-b ) .",
    "we assume that @xmath67 .",
    "although the multifractal spectrum seems to consist of just two values , namely , @xmath68 and @xmath47 , the legendre spectrum is a full segment with ends at @xmath69 and @xmath70 , that is , a linear spectrum .",
    "the corresponding slope of @xmath24 has a jump from @xmath37 to @xmath46 at @xmath71 now imagine that we superimpose on this bifractal another bifractal , either @xmath72 or @xmath73 , such that the exponent @xmath74 fulfills @xmath75 and its corrsponding dimension fulfills @xmath76 namely , such that the point @xmath77 is below the segment with ends at @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "this second bifractal will be _ invisible _ in both the function @xmath24 ( which gives the moments ) and the legendre spectrum .",
    "we can consider a linear multifractal spectrum , with @xmath78 , as a limit of general convex spectra , with @xmath28 . to be more precise ,",
    "if we are given two exponents @xmath37 and @xmath46 , and their respective dimensions @xmath68 and @xmath47 , convexity implies that @xmath13 , for @xmath79 , lies above the segment with ends at @xmath68 and @xmath47 .",
    "assuming that @xmath24 is differentiable , @xmath80 is an decreasing function that interpolates from @xmath46 to @xmath37 in a range @xmath81 $ ] .",
    "as @xmath82 , @xmath83 becomes discontinuous and @xmath24 has an angle , at some value @xmath84 $ ] .",
    "then @xmath13 collapses to the linear spectrum ( from above ) . in this limit ,",
    "the multifractal becomes dominated by the two fractals at the ends of the segment , with dimensions @xmath68 and @xmath47 . in other words , this is a _ bifractal limit _ of the multifractal spectrum .",
    "we can distinguish two cases , according to whether @xmath85 is larger or smaller than one .",
    "in the former case , the measure s concentrate fulfills @xmath86 , so @xmath87 ; in the latter case , the measure s concentrate fulfills @xmath88 , so @xmath89 . in words , we distinguish whether the measure concentrates in either the less or the more singular fractal set . in the former case ,",
    "the measure s concentrate and support coincide , whereas in the latter case , the measure s concentrate corresponds to @xmath37 and the measure s support to @xmath46 .",
    "of course , we can also consider the borderline case with @xmath90 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath91 for @xmath92 , so the mesasure concentrates uniformly over the full interval .",
    "let us mention three interesting examples of linear multifractal spectrum , corresponding to the three above - mentioned cases .",
    "the first example is a random distribution of a _",
    "finite _ number of power - law mass concentrations with exponent @xmath11 ( _ one _ concentration suffices ) .",
    "this is a bifractal with exponents @xmath3 and 3 , and dimensions @xmath93 and @xmath94 , respectively ( gaite , 2005-a ) .",
    "of course , the measure concentrates in the regular component .",
    "the second example is provided by the one - dimensional adhesion model .",
    "reasoning about the properties of _ devil s staircases _ , she , aurell & frisch ( 1992 ) and aurell et al ( 1997 ) show that the mass distribution produced by that model is bifractal : it has singularities of _ delta - function _ type , that is , with @xmath95 , and there appears , in addition , a component with @xmath96 and @xmath97 ( homogeneously distributed , in one dimension ) .",
    "the extension of these results to higher dimension is a moot point ( vergassola et al , 1994 ) .",
    "the third example corresponds to the borderline type bifractal : it is a bifractal formed by the union of two separate monofractals ( with different dimension ) . in it ,",
    "the measure is uniformly concentrated , such that each fractal holds a finite fraction of the total mass .",
    "let us finally note that any piece of a convex multifractal spectrum that is not very curved can be approximated by a linear spectrum and , therefore , by the corresponding bifractal limit .",
    "this property will be useful for the connection with the press - schechter formalism ( sect.[p - s_sect ] ) .",
    "halo models of large - scale structure assume that the dark matter is in the form of collapsed halos with definite density profile .",
    "this profile is established by averaging over angular directions , hence obtaining a radial profile , whose functional form is essentially the same for every halo ( but with different parameters ) .",
    "several forms have been proposed , the simplest one being a power law @xmath98 , which is also a limit of other more complicated profiles .",
    "a power law halo profile can be related with a power law correlation function ( peebles , 1974 ; mcclelland & silk , 1977 ; sheth & jain , 1997 ; murante et al , 1997 ) .",
    "it is also intrinsically associated with self - gravity : the newton - poisson equations are scale invariant ; so we expect that the mass concentrations produced by them are also scale invariant .",
    "this argument is valid in the _ strongly nonlinear _",
    "regime , where the dynamics dominates over the initial conditions .",
    "in particular , the _ stable clustering _ model ( peebles , 1980 ) supports this hypothesis ( sheth & jain , 1997 ) .    therefore , we define halos to have a power - law profile , namely , the _ singular _ profile @xmath99 with @xmath100 .",
    "but it is obvious that we can not assign a definite size to a halo with this profile .",
    "indeed , in a multifractal that is scale invariant on ever decreasing scales , as the definition requires , it is not possible to assign a size or a mass to any structure , because that would break scale invariance : any structure must be repeated in every size , reaching up to the homogeneity scale , which is the only existent scale . in consequence , mass concentrations are point - like mass singularities and they can _ only _ be classified by their singularity strength , given by the exponent @xmath3 . however , a singular power - law profile can not be physically realized .",
    "in fact , what is available is a _",
    "finite _ sample from a multifractal , which is not scale invariant on ever decreasing scales .",
    "thus , on small scales , there is a change in the nature of the matter distribution , related to the breaking of scale invariance , which allows us to assign halos definite size and masses .",
    "this change takes place in the large scale distribution of matter and , more clearly , in cosmological @xmath0-body simulations , as we shall explain . of course , on scales smaller than the scale of this change , the power - law halo profile is altered .",
    "its shape may turn out to fit a different power law , thus becoming a combination of two power laws , like in current halo profile models ( cooray & sheth , 2002 ) .",
    "if we use coarse multifractal analysis , the breaking of scale invariance appears below a given cell size , which we choose as the size of coarse - grained halos .",
    "then , the number of ( coarse - grained ) halos is finite .",
    "in addition to the full set of halos , with their respective masses , the matter distribution is defined by the distribution of their positions .",
    "we will treat the distributions of halos in greater detail in sect .",
    "[ fract - dist - halos ] .",
    "let us note that a uniform coarse - graining length is convenient but not mandatory : in multifractal analysis , one can actually choose pieces of very different size , as commented in sect.[coarsemf ] . in particular , halos can be defined to have different size and can be given by a different condition . in principle , halos can be defined by a condition on the density , as in the usual definition .",
    "the possibility of using various definitions has already been noted by valageas , lacey & schaeffer ( 2000 ) .",
    "we choose a uniform coarse - graining length , following vergassola et al ( 1994 ) .",
    "it is a convenient choice , well adapted to @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "we define a void as a region with very low or vanishing density , but we need to make precise what this condition means .",
    "the multifractal formalism is very useful in this regard . in this formalism , the singular concentrations to which we associate halos have a power law profile @xmath99 , with @xmath100 .",
    "but , if @xmath101 , there is no singularity .",
    "the value @xmath10 ( @xmath102 ) is a reference : a mass concentration with this exponent is not really a concentration : its density is regular , namely , non - divergent and non - vanishing .",
    "exponents @xmath103 correspond to points of vanishing density , which we naturally associate with voids . furthermore ,",
    "the total mass in voids vanishes , since the measure s concentrate , with @xmath104 , can only be in regions with @xmath105 ( note that , necessarily , @xmath106 ) .    however , any neighbourhood of points in voids , with @xmath103 , is not totally empty .",
    "it is possible to have mass around points with vanishing density .",
    "there may or may not be totally empty voids , according to whether the measure s support occupies the full volume or not : if it does not , there are regions with non - vanishing volume and no mass in them ( in mathematical terminology , these regions are _ open sets _ ) . if the dimension of the support of the measure is smaller than three , there need to be totally empty voids , and the multifractal is called _ lacunar_. in particular , there may be a scaling set of totally empty voids .",
    "this is always the case in one dimension if the the measure s support has dimension smaller than one , but the geometry of voids is more complex in higher dimensions ( gaite , 2005-b ; gaite , 2006 ) .    to illustrate the nature of multifractal voids in a simple case , let us consider again the one - dimensional adhesion model . in this model ,",
    "the mass is concentrated in _ shocks _ and their locations form a _",
    "dense _ set ( she , aurell & frisch , 1992 ; vergassola et al , 1994 ) .",
    "the adjective `` dense '' is understood with its mathematical meaning : a set is dense in an interval , say , if in any sub - interval , however small , there are points of the set ; a typical example is the set of rational numbers between 0 and 1 . in the one - dimensional adhesion model , while the density at non - shock points vanishes ( they have @xmath107 ) , these points are surrounded by infinitesimally close small shocks that make the mass in any neighbourhood of them to be non - vanishing . of course",
    ", we could make in that distribution a totally empty void by removing the mass in a sub - interval .    with the preceding definition of void",
    ", we can actually consider a multifractal distribution ( in three dimensions ) as the union of ( i ) halo clusters , that is , clusters of mass concentrations with @xmath11 , ( ii ) voids , that is , mass depletions with @xmath103 , and ( iii ) the boundary between both regions , formed by points with @xmath10 .",
    "however , we must beware once more of relying on our geometrical intuition when dealing with multifractals : the set of points with @xmath108 may not be two - dimensional and so it may not constitute a regular boundary . indeed , the dimension of this set is @xmath109 , which can well be larger than two .",
    "we will see in sect .",
    "[ voids - gif2 ] what this implies for the shape of voids in an example from a cosmological simulation .",
    "let us now consider a coarse - grained multifractal .",
    "the coarse - grained density can be defined to be regular everywhere ( with no singularities ) and it only vanishes at a point if the mass vanishes in a neighbourhood of it .",
    "therefore , the density only vanishes inside totally empty voids .",
    "nevertheless , we can still define voids as depleted regions comprising coarse - grained exponents @xmath110 ( @xmath111 inside a totally empty void ) .",
    "note that the boundary of voids is then a coarse - grained version of the above mentioned fractal surface , so it loses small pieces as some singularities get smeared .",
    "finally , we notice that the presence of voids in the galaxy distribution was a principal motivation for the bifractal model of cosmic structure .",
    "let us quote balian & schaeffer ( 1989-b ) : `` the ocurrence of a bifractal behaviour is due to the coexistence at the same scales of clusters and voids '' . according to our discussion of the linear multifractal spectra in sect .",
    "[ linearmf ] , we can deduce that a bifractal in which the voids define one of the two fractal dimensions must be such that the measure concentrates in the more singular set and , in addition , such that the more regular set has @xmath112 and is associated with the voids .",
    "an interesting one - dimensional example is the adhesion model , according to sect.[linearmf ] .",
    "however , `` coexistence at the same scales of clusters and voids '' takes place in most multifractals , not only in bifractals .",
    "in coarse multifractal analysis , moments are defined by eq.([mq2 ] ) .",
    "there is a related way to define statistical moments , namely , by using the density probability distribution function , and this definition has been applied to multifractals ( borgani , 1993 ; valageas , 1999 ) .",
    "if @xmath113 is the probability of having density @xmath114 , then , its moments are @xmath115 since in multifractals the density does not exist at singular points , @xmath114 in this definition must be also understood as a _ coarse - grained density_. besides , this definition implies that @xmath116 , assuming @xmath113 normalized .",
    "in contrast , @xmath117 , in general , and it is related with the fractal dimension of the measure s support . in coarse multifractal analysis ,",
    "the precise relationship between both definitions of @xmath18-moments is @xmath118 ( where the sums are over non - empty cells ) .",
    "for example , @xmath119 is the average density ( within the measure s support ) and scales with exponent @xmath120 .",
    "if the measure s support has dimension 3 , then the average density is @xmath48-independent . in this case",
    ", it is natural to normalize the density field by dividing it by the average density , so that @xmath121 ( valageas , 1999 ) .",

    "that quotient diverges .",
    "one can derive other relations between moments .",

    "`` hierarchical correlation functions imply monofractality of the distribution '' ( borgani , 1993 ) .",
    "an analogous relation holds for @xmath131 if @xmath132 .",
    "the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the coarse - grained density , @xmath133 , is directly related to the mass function and , therefore , to the coarse multifractal spectrum ( sect.[coarsemf ] ) : the number of cells with density @xmath114 is the box - counting approximation to the fractal dimension of the set of mass concentrations with exponent @xmath134 .",
    "the general statement of this relation is best made in the context of probability theory , namely , of the theory of _",
    "large deviations_. the relevant concepts in this theory appear naturally when we consider the generalization of the central limit theorem to nonlinear distributions and , hence , we regard the lognormal distribution as a general nonlinear pdf .      as a simple extension of the gaussian density field in the linear regime , coles & jones ( 1991 ) proposed that a lognormal field model would be suitable for the nonlinear regime , especially , in the _ weakly _ nonlinear regime .",
    "we shall see that a lognormal density pdf is natural in connection with multifractals .    from a purely statistical point of view",
    ", the gaussian distribution is associated with the central limit theorem and one expects that it appear in many situations where the _ sum _ of a large number of independent random variables is involved .",
    "a nonlinear analogue of this theorem is provided by the _ multiplication _ of independent random variables , because multiplication of these variables is equivalent to addition of their logarithms .",
    "hence , the lognormal distribution arises as the limit distribution in multiplicative processes .",
    "this formulation of the lognormal distribution corresponds to the _ large - deviation _ formulation of multifractals ( frisch , 1995 ; sornette , 2000 ; harte , 2001 ) , which is particularly adapted to random cascade processes but has a broader scope .",
    "we proceed to introducing a few relevant notions , leaving aside innecessary details .",
    "we may recall that the central limit theorem considers the limit distribution of the sum of @xmath135 independent random variables with finite variances ( and zero mean ) .",
    "it states that this limit distribution is gaussian , with variance given by the sum of the variances . in the particular case of @xmath135 independent",
    "identically distributed variables , their sum divided by @xmath136 has a gaussian distribution ( with the common variance ) .",
    "however , if we want to take into account unlikely events , that is deviations of magnitude larger than @xmath136 , we must consider higher moments than the variance .",
    "in particular , if we call @xmath137 the sum of the @xmath135 variables , as @xmath138 , @xmath139 \\sim e^{n\\,s(x)}.\\ ] ] in this formula , @xmath140 is an `` intensive '' variable , that is , finite in the limit @xmath141 , and @xmath142 is an entropy function called the cramr function .",
    "this function can be obtained from the full ( common ) distribution function of the variables ( frisch , 1995 ; sornette , 2000 ) .",
    "its second order expansion at its maximum ( assumed unique ) gives the gaussian approximation that constitutes the central limit theorem .",
    "in multiplicative processes , such as random cascades or fragmentation processes , we also have that a good approximation is given by the two basic moments ( mean and variance ) of the logarithm of the relevant random variable",
    ". therefore , the lognormal distribution appears as the basic approximation to the distribution of mass concentrations in a multifractal .",
    "this has already been noted by jones , coles & martnez ( 1992 ) .",
    "the large - deviation formalism becomes necessary if we need to consider mass concentrations that appear rarely , because of their small or large exponent @xmath3 with respect to @xmath34 , the value that maximizes @xmath13 ( assumed unique ) . in fragmentation cascades , the number @xmath135 in the hierarchy gives the scale , for example , @xmath143 for a binary division . the sum variable @xmath137 represents minus the logarithm of the mass , such that the  intensive \" variable is now the exponent @xmath144 .",
    "therefore , @xmath145 \\sim e^{n\\,s(\\a)},\\ ] ] and we are to identify @xmath146 with the multifractal spectrum @xmath13 ; namely , @xmath147 .",
    "thus the large - deviation condition is equivalent to focusing on mass concentrations with exponents @xmath3 such that their supporting regions have small dimension @xmath13 compared with its largest value . in the `` small - deviation '' regime , we can use the second order expansion ( parabolic approximation ) of @xmath13 at @xmath34 , the value that maximizes it ( assumed unique ) .",
    "this value corresponds to the measure s support .",
    "the `` small - deviation '' regime is indeed the weakly nonlinear regime , and it gives a lognormal pdf .",
    "note that jones , coles & martnez ( 1992 ) chose to take a parabolic approximation to @xmath13 that is not its second order expansion but instead makes it tangent to the diagonal , like the full @xmath13 .",
    "this choice does not seem related to the theory of large deviations .",
    "however , a large - deviation expansion around the measure s concentrate ( the point of tangency to the diagonal ) is possible as well .",
    "let us consider the mass moment @xmath15 and its associated mass pdf @xmath148 \\sim m\\,e^{n\\,s(\\a ) } \\sim e^{n\\,[f(\\a)-\\a]\\,\\ln 2}.\\ ] ] in the limit @xmath141 , this density vanishes unless @xmath149 , that is , unless in the measure s concentrate .",
    "in other words , there is no mass outside the concentrate of the measure ( mass ) , according with its name .",
    "nevertheless , we can consider again a `` small - deviation '' regime given by the second order expansion around the measure s concentrate , such that it gives a lognormal mass pdf .",
    "note that this lognormal mass pdf is generally different from the previous lognormal pdf .",
    "we must mention that the lognormal approximation to multifractals assumes that the multifractal spectrum @xmath13 is well behaved , namely , that it has second derivative .",
    "of course , this condition of differentiability may not hold in some cases .",
    "in particular , a bifractal spectrum does not have well - defined second derivative at its maximum .",
    "it is well known that the lognormal distribution is not determined by its moments @xmath150 , that is , there are other distributions with the same set of moments . in physical terms",
    ", the reason for this non - uniqueness can be ascribed to the fact that high - order moments are dominated by high - density regions , so that the full set of moments contains insufficient information about very low - density regions or _ voids _ ( coles & jones , 1991 ) .",
    "this was the motivation for considering the additional information on voids , namely , the void probability function , as a necessary ingredient .",
    "in fact , the combination of separate information on clusters and voids , respectively , and the assumption of scale invariance led balian & schaeffer ( 1989-b ) to propose a _",
    "bifractal _ model of large scale structure .",
    "from the preceding discussion about the lognormal model and its relation with multifractals , we can deduce that coles & jones s ( 1991 ) and balian & schaeffer s ( 1989 ) arguments are related and that we do not need to restrict ourselves to bifractals .",
    "indeed , we have already pointed out that the singular nature of multifractals requires us to use the full set of moments @xmath19 , for @xmath151 . in particular ,",
    "negative values @xmath152 are typically associated with voids .",
    "we have explained the connection between multifractal and the lognormal model of coles & jones ( 1991 ) in regard to the density pdf .",
    "further connection in regard to @xmath135-point correlation functions , if possible , seems to require additional assumptions .",
    "we note , in particular , that there is _ no scale invariance _ in the lognormal model as a field theory , in spite of the arguments presented by coles & jones ( 1991 ) regarding a possible connection with multifractality .",
    "the usual mass function in halo models is the one given by the press - schechter spherical collapse formalism ( mo & white , 1996 ; sheth & jain , 1997 ) .",
    "this formalism relies on an initial gaussian pdf . regarding the relation that we have established in multifractals between the mass function of halos and the coarse density pdf ( for @xmath153 )",
    ", we shall explore if there is a connection with the press - schechter mass function .",
    "let us briefly recall the relevant elements of this formalism .",
    "let us consider the coarse density and its pdf . for early times or large values of the coarse - graining length @xmath48 , we can consider the density constant ( @xmath154 , if the total volume and mass are normalized ) except for small fluctuations given by a gaussian pdf .",
    "this gaussian pdf has a scale - dependent variance @xmath155 . to obtain the mass function of collapsed objects",
    ", one needs a criterion to decide which regions of size @xmath48 will collapse .",
    "the simplest criterion is that every region in which the density exceeds some threshold @xmath156 must collapse . given that the pdf is gaussian , the cumulative distribution function is @xmath157 .",
    "\\label{p - s_eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the mass of regions of size @xmath48 is @xmath158 .",
    "therefore , we can express @xmath159 in eq .",
    "( [ p - s_eq ] ) in terms of the mass of collapsed objects , provided that this equation gives the fraction of regions of mass greater than @xmath57 that collapse for a given threshold @xmath156 .",
    "we may call this fraction @xmath160 .",
    "it is a function of the ratio @xmath161 , so that raising the threshold @xmath156 at fixed @xmath162 is equivalent to diminishing @xmath163 at fixed @xmath156 and making density peaks smaller .",
    "@xmath163 must be a decreasing function of @xmath48 and , therefore , of @xmath57 .",
    "thus , collapse of large masses is suppressed .",
    "the mass function is @xmath164 where we have introduced the factor @xmath165 which represents the total number of collapsed objects .",
    "we assume an initial power - law spectrum of gaussian fluctuations , namely , @xmath166 ( @xmath167 is the spectral index in fourier space ) .",
    "then , the mass function is also a power law , but with an exponential decay for large masses ; namely , @xmath168 , \\label{p - s_mf}\\ ] ] where @xmath169 stands for the large - mass cutoff .",
    "we must now consider carefully the limitations of the press - schechter formalism .",
    "for this , me must distinguish the one - dimensional case from the others , including the physical three - dimensional case .",
    "the essential assumptions are the validity of an initial gaussian pdf and of the spherical collapse model .",
    "a gaussian pdf is valid if @xmath48 is large , namely , @xmath155 .",
    "the spherical collapse model amounts to assuming that every overdensity above the threshold gives rise to a symmetric collapsed object .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption in one dimension , but it is questionable in higher dimensions .",
    "in fact , only a small percentage of the initial overdensities undergo nearly spherical collapse , and they are precisely the largest overdensities ( audit , teyssier & alimi , 1997 ; lee & shandarin , 1998 ) .",
    "this is particularly clear in the zeldovich approximation .",
    "thus , the press - schechter formalism can only apply , in three dimensions , to the formation of the strongest concentrations ( as already noted by vergassola et al ( 1994 ) in their comparison of the press - schechter formalism with the adhesion model ) .",
    "the press - schechter formalism has been extended to ellipsoidal collapse , with the consequent improvement ( sheth & tormen , 1999 ) .",
    "however , this extension still excludes irregular collapses , which are common for weak concentrations .    in conclusion ,",
    "the press - schechter formalism produces a power - law mass function with a large - mass cutoff , but it can only be applied to massive halos . considering this formalism as an approximation to the full nonlinear halo mass function based on the linear theory ,",
    "we would like to explore its relationship with a lognormal pdf , which is valid in the weakly nonlinear regime .",
    "then the question is if relatively strong mass concentrations can in fact have a power - law mass function ( neglecting the exponential cutoff ) that is consistent with an overall lognormal - like distribution .    to answer this question ,",
    "let us mention firstly that it is known that the lognormal distribution can be mistaken for a power law over a relatively large interval ( sornette , 2000 , page 80 ) .",
    "as a parabolic approximation to a multifractal spectrum , the lognormal distribution derives from the second order expansion around its maximum , representing the measure s support .",
    "but the measure s concentrate is best represented by the second order ( parabolic ) approximation around the point @xmath104 , as explained in sect.[lognormal ] .",
    "this second parabola can actually be very close to the first one . in any event ,",
    "an even simpler approximation is the first order ( linear ) approximation around the point @xmath104 .",
    "in fact , a poor sampling of a multifractal will mainly reflect the measure s concentrate .",
    "let @xmath170 ; given that @xmath89 and @xmath171 , the linear approximation around the measure s concentrate has unit slope , such that it becomes an even bifractal ( not loaded toward either the more or the less singular end , as explained in sect .",
    "[ linearmf ] ) .",
    "in contrast , note that the power - law part of the press - schechter mass function , eq.([p - s_mf ] ) , produces a divergence in its integral over @xmath57 in the limit @xmath172 .",
    "of course , this divergence is killed by the exponential factor .",
    "nevertheless , it indicates that _ the mass concentrates on massive halos_. in this regard , the press - schechter mass function is analogous to the mass function of the one - dimensional adhesion model ( according to our discussion in sect.[linearmf ] ) .",
    "this is not surprising : the one - dimensional adhesion model is the simplest mathematical description of the notion of collapse of overdensities , realizing a collapse into delta - type singularities ( vergassola et al , 1994 ) .",
    "the realization of scale invariance in a multifractal is characterized by the multifractal spectrum . in sect .",
    "[ coarsemf ] , we have shown its relation to the mass function , which is related in turn to the pdf @xmath133 .",
    "this pdf can be represented by the statistical moments @xmath131 ( sect .",
    "[ pdf ] ) .",
    "however , in cosmology , it is normal to measure correlations of a given class of objects rather than moments of the total dark matter distribution .",
    "more precisely , one measures positions of luminous objects , namely , galaxies , and computes their correlation functions to establish the statistical properties of the distribution , which may include scale invariance , etc .",
    "one can associate galaxies with dark matter halos and , therefore , deduce statistical properties of the distribution of these halos ; and viceversa .",
    "this is why the distribution of halos has special interest .",
    "if the full dark matter distribution is scale invariant , then the correlation functions of the distribution of halos must be power laws .",
    "more precisely , in a multifractal distribution , every population formed by similar halos is a monofractal , although different populations have different dimensions ( gaite , 2005-a ) .",
    "we can describe this difference between populations as a kind of _ bias _ , albeit of _ non - linear _ type .",
    "actually , the very definition of multifractal implies its interpretation as a set of fractal distributions of mass concentrations ( and depletions ) , classified according to the different values of the exponent @xmath3 : a set of concentrations with exponent @xmath3 forms a monofractal of dimension @xmath13 .",
    "however , for a given exponent @xmath173 , the corresponding set of concentrations generally has dimension @xmath174 , whereas a monofractal fulfills the equality @xmath175 .",
    "this happens because in the neighbourhood of the concentrations with @xmath176 are present other concentrations with @xmath177 , the mass of which raises the singularity exponent from @xmath178 to @xmath173 .    in the coarse - grained formulation with fixed halo size @xmath179",
    ", we have a finite number of individual halos which we can classify by their masses .",
    "then , each class defines a population and we can compute its number - radius relation , @xmath180 ( sect.[coarsemf ] ) . the fractal dimension obtained from each number - radius relation is the only quantity necessary to determine the corresponding monofractal scaling .",
    "thus , the full set of dimensions obtained in this way constitutes an approximation to the multifractal spectrum ( in the range @xmath11 ) .",
    "we have defined halos by relying on coarse multifractal analysis with a given cell size .",
    "in contrast , the measure @xmath181 is point - centered , like the mass - radius relation , given by eq.([mq ] ) with @xmath182 .",
    "however , this combination of lattice and point - centered methods is consistent .",
    "nevertheless , one can also use the coarse - grained probability @xmath133 , providing information on the number of boxes of size @xmath48 with mass @xmath183 and , hence , on the multifractal spectrum ( as explained in sect .",
    "[ lognormal ] ) . using several values of @xmath48",
    ", we would reproduce the _ histogram method _ of calculating the multifractal spectrum ( falconer , 2003 ) , which indeed consists of making histograms of the @xmath184 for several @xmath48 .",
    "this method is , in general , less suitable than the method of moments ( which uses the @xmath185 of eq .",
    "( [ mq2 ] ) ) .",
    "in fact , ee have found most convenient the procedure that consists of ( i ) the definition of halo populations at given @xmath179 , and ( ii ) the calculation of their respective number - radius relations @xmath181 .",
    "the explanation lies on the effect on correslations of a limited scaling range , as we show next .      in general ,",
    "the mass distribution can be described by either the coarse - grained probability @xmath133 or the moments @xmath19 ( or @xmath131 ) .",
    "in particular , its multifractal properties can be described by either @xmath13 or @xmath24 , which are related by the legendre transform ( sect .",
    "[ moments ] ) and provide identical information , _ in principle_. the formulation of a multifractal as a fractal distribution of halos emphasizes the scale invariance of each halo population ; in particular , the number - radius relation @xmath181 expresses the scaling properties of each halo population as a monofractal , such that the full set of exponents of all populations constitutes an approximation to the multifractal spectrum ( in the range @xmath11 ) .",
    "therefore , the full set of exponents also provides an approximation to @xmath24 , in the corresponding range of @xmath18 .",
    "the full mass - radius relation @xmath16 is directly related with the reduced two point - correlation @xmath186 , such that scale invariance implies that they both are power laws .",
    "unfortunately , the analysis of the two - point correlation function in cosmological @xmath0-body simulations by the virgo consortium has not shown any convincing scaling ( jenkins et al , 1998 ) .",
    "we do not consider this negative result as ruling out scale invariance .",
    "in fact , we can understand it as an effect of a limited scaling range in a distribution that is actually multifractal , rather than monofractal .",
    "let us explain how that effect arises .",
    "the equivalence between @xmath13 and @xmath24 relies on the one - to - one dependence @xmath26 .",
    "however , this one - to - one dependence only holds in a mathematical multifractal ( in the limit of ever decreasing scales ) . in the coarse - grained formulation",
    ", we can easily deduce that the average over populations implied by the definition of @xmath19 , eq.([mq ] ) , will spoil the scaling of _ each _ particular population ( with a given exponent @xmath3 ) .",
    "in other words , in the coarse - grained formulation , every halo population contributes to some extent to a @xmath18-moment ( in particular , to @xmath16 ) , rather than only the population with @xmath26 . for this reason , to realize scale invariance , it is preferable to analyse the fractal distributions of halos _ independently _ , rather than the @xmath18-moments of the total distribution .",
    "so far , we have used the definitions of scaling exponents , for example , eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) , as impliying naive scaling relations , such as @xmath187 .",
    "of course , this relation holds in a limited range of scales ( namely , of @xmath188 ) .",
    "in addition to the restriction of scaling on small scales , already studied , there has to be a transition to homogeneity on large scales . over the scale of this transition ,",
    "say @xmath189 , the relation @xmath187 undergoes a crossover to @xmath190 ( homogeneity ) .",
    "therefore , we can define @xmath189 by the equation @xmath191 where @xmath192 is the large - scale mean density .",
    "analogously , the halo number - radius relation @xmath193 ( sect .  [ coarsemf ] ) can also be written as @xmath194 where @xmath195 is the large - scale mean density of halos of exponent @xmath3 .",
    "the procedure to determine @xmath189 from @xmath181 consists of an analysis of the crossover to homogeneity in its log - log graph .",
    "it must be done for several values of @xmath3 , to check that the results coincide .",
    "actually , the extreme cases are most useful ; that is to say , we may take , on the one hand , ( a ) the smallest value of @xmath3 ( the largest halo mass ) such that there is a sufficient number of halos to compute @xmath181 , and , on the other hand , ( b ) the largest value of @xmath3 ( the smallest halo mass ) such that its fractal dimension is sufficiently smaller than three as to let us clearly perceive the crossover to homogeneity . in sect .",
    "[ fracr - dist - h ] , we shall see how to carry out this procedure in an example .",
    "in @xmath0-body cosmological simulations , the nature of the distribution changes on small scales because there is ( i ) a minimal mass , corresponding to one particle , and ( ii ) a softening of the gravitational force .",
    "the minimal mass defines the discretization scale , namely , the linear size of the volume per particle .",
    "the larger of the discretization scale and the softening scale , usually , the discretization scale , is the natural ( intrinsic ) coarse - graining scale of the distribution .    since all the particles have the same mass , the mass is measured by counting particles .",
    "we have already defined _ coarse multifractal analysis _ and mentioned its relation with the method of  counts - in - cells \" ( balian & schaeffer , 1989-a ) , whereby one puts a @xmath48-mesh of cubes in the total volume ( which is itself a large cube ) and measures the mass inside each cube ( cell ) by counting particles . in this method , initially and as long as the evolution is linear , cells of the size of the discretization scale contain one particle per cell .",
    "therefore , halos only arise in the nonlinear stage , as they concentrate particles from other regions that become _",
    "voids_.    we define mass concentrations ( or depletions ) at scale @xmath48 and measure their exponents by the equation @xmath196 , where @xmath48 is the cell size .",

    "here is a number of consequences that can be directly extracted from the coarse multifractal spectrum , such as is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig - mfspec ] :    * the entropy dimension is @xmath240 .",
    "this means that this multifractal is concentrated in a set which is not very far from being homogeneous ( dimension three ) . *",
    "the largest fractal dimension is actually three , so this is the dimension of the measure s support . in conjunction with statistical homogeneity , this essentially means that there are no totally empty voids in the full dark matter distribution ( see the comments in sect .",
    "[ voids - gif2 ] ) . *",
    "@xmath241 this value corresponds again to the multifractal support .",
    "we remark that it is formed by mass depletions , that is , such that they belong to voids .",
    "therefore , voids ( though _ not _ totally empty ) dominate the distribution ( see also fig .  [ figs3 ] ) .",
    "* the set of regular points with @xmath10 ( non - vanishing density ) , namely , the boundary of voids , turns out to have @xmath242 .",
    "this fractal dimension is very close to three .",
    "this does not necessarily mean that each piece of surface is very crumpled , because the fractal dimension is also a measure of fragmentation ( mandelbrot , 1977 ) .",
    "therefore , its large dimension surely results from the proliferation of small halo clusters that fill the voids .",
    "this type of geometry can be inferred from fig .",
    "[ figs3 ] .",
    "we have shown that a statistically self - similar multifractal model explains the relevant features of the geometry of the large scale structure of matter .",
    "we have described this multifractal model as consisting of singular mass concentrations and regular mass depletions ( plus a boundary between both ) .",
    "hence , we have proposed to identify mass concentrations with halos and to identify mass depletions as belonging to voids .",
    "the identification of halos with mass concentrations implies , in the scale - invariant limit , that they have an _ average _ power - law profile , although they can actually be very anisotropic .",
    "in addition , halos are clustered with a power - law form of its two - point correlation functions . in particular",
    ", every population of mass concentrations with equal strength ( singularity exponent ) has a definite fractal dimension .",
    "we have emphasized that scale invariance , in fact , forbids one to distinguish the mass distributions of matter inside halos from the distribution outside .",
    "that is to say , scale invariance actually deprives halos of meaning as entities with a given size ( or mass ) , so they can only be classified by their _ strength _ exponent .",
    "therefore , halos can only be given a size in connection with the breakdown of scale invariance . in this connection ,",
    "the number of halos becomes finite and their average profile changes .",
    "in cosmological @xmath0-body simulations , we have argued that it is most convenient to use the _ uniform _ coarse - graining length given by the discretization scale ( the linear size of the volume per particle ) .",
    "the uniform size of halos in our multifractal model can be interpreted in terms of standard coarse multifractal analysis . in @xmath0-body simulations , which use equal - mass particles ,",
    "coarse multifractal analysis becomes equivalent to the method of counts - in - cells .",
    "each halo is formed by a variable number of particles , a number which can be small .",
    "each population of halos with ( about ) the same number of particles forms a monofractal with a definite dimension .",
    "we have analysed , in the virgo @xmath1-cdm gif2 simulation , the mass function of halos and their distribution .",
    "the distributions of the different populations of halos show well - defined scaling ranges , corresponding to different scaling dimensions , and shows a common scale of transition to homogeneity .",
    "we have selected two representative populations of heavy or light halos , resulting in fractal dimensions @xmath243 or @xmath244 , respectively .",
    "note that these two values span the usual range of fractal dimensions measured in the galaxy distribution .",
    "the conclusion of our analysis of the gif2 simulation is that scale invariance holds in the nonlinear regime reproduced in @xmath0-body simulations and that it can be measured , contrary to the conclusion of jenkins et al ( 1998 ) .",
    "the scale of transition to homogeneity in the fractal distributions of halos of the gif2 simulation is , in physical units , @xmath245 mpc .",
    "although this value corresponds to a dark - matter simulation , it roughly agrees with standard values found in the galaxy distribution .",
    "the fractal distributions of halos with different dimensions are biased with respect to the full particle distribution , which has fixed mass - radius dimension @xmath246 .",
    "of course , this bias is different from the usual linear bias assumed in cosmology , which only affects the _ amplitude _ of the two - point correlation function : it is a bias that affects the exponent , that is to say , the fractal dimension",
    ". we may properly call this kind of bias _ nonlinear bias of scaling type_.    mass depletions , belonging to voids , are very undersampled in @xmath0-body simulations : by definition , depleted halo - size cells have no particles ; or they have a few of them , at the most , if we define the halo size to be somewhat larger than the discretization scale .",
    "so the few particles in voids are a gross representation of the small halos that one would find there at a higher resolution . in this",
    "regard , our conclusion is similar to that of kuhlman , melott & shandarin ( 1996 ) .",
    "however , self - similarity allows us to draw further conclusions regarding the distribution of matter in voids , since the properties of the distribution can be obtained by coarse multifractal analysis with larger cell sizes .    as to the rle of correlation moments ,",
    "multifractals are defined by the full set of moments @xmath19 for @xmath20 ( or the pdf moments @xmath247 plus @xmath248 ) , whereas monofractals are defined only by @xmath16 .",
    "in particular , monofractals fulfill the hierarchical relation @xmath249 , for any @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the singular _ and _ heterogeneous nature of multifractals implies that the moments with @xmath250 are not sufficient .",
    "in fact , most important are @xmath30 , associated to the the measure s support and concentrate , respectively .",
    "larger @xmath18 s are also relevant , in particular , @xmath182 , but the information gathered from large-@xmath18 moments only applies to the strongest concentrations ( most massive halos ) .",
    "the negative-@xmath18 moments are related to the distribution of matter in voids .",
    "therefore , they are affected by the undersampling of voids . however , if the scaling range is sufficiently large , these negative-@xmath18 moments can be calculated ( approximately ) , as well as the part of the multifractal spectrum given by them .    regarding @xmath18-moments of the full mass distribution in @xmath0-body simulations",
    ", we have seen that they scale poorly .",
    "in contrast , the analysis in terms of fractal populations of equal - mass halos by their number - radius relation ( or two - point correlation function of their positions ) provides good scaling , suitable for calculating the fractal dimension of each population .",
    "the reason for the poor scaling of @xmath18-moments is that the one - to - one correspondence between mass concentrations ( or depletions ) and @xmath18-moments given by the function @xmath26 is only approximate when the scaling range is limited .",
    "if several concentration strengths contribute to the same @xmath18-moment , their mixing spoils the scaling of that @xmath18-moment .",
    "we have discussed in sect .",
    "[ counts ] how this mixing of halo populations takes place .",
    "in particular , the various halo populations contribute evenly to @xmath55 and , hence , to the full two - point correlation , altering its scaling .",
    "therefore , it is natural that jenkins et al ( 1998 ) observed deviations from scaling in their analysis of @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "it is also natural that zehavi et al ( 2004 ) observe deviations from scaling in their analysis of the sloan digital sky survey : if one associates galaxies to halos , their distribution is likely multifractal , so the mixing of populations takes place as well .",
    "in fact , zehavi et al ( 2005 ) and tikhonov ( 2006 ) have found that the slope @xmath251 of the log - log plot of the two - point correlation decreases with luminosity , which agrees with a multifractal distribution .    in the gif2 simulation , at the scale of the halo size @xmath179 , the mass function is well described by a power law , so that it corresponds to a linear multifractal spectrum and the distribution is actually _",
    "bifractal_. to be precise , we find @xmath225 , very accurately .",
    "therefore , the corresponding bifractal fulfills @xmath252 and is an even bifractal , in which the measure is uniformly concentrated ( not loaded toward either the more or the less singular end , as explained in sect .",
    "[ linearmf ] ) .",
    "thus , the bifractal mass function furnished by equal - size halos must be distinguished from the press - schechter mass function , which ( apart for the large - mass cutoff ) is equivalent to a linear mutifractal spectrum concentrated on the singular end , that is to say , on the heavy halos .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ p - s_mf ] ) shows that a mass function @xmath225 is associated with the spectral index @xmath253 , which is just beyond the allowed range .",
    "of course , equal - size and press - schechter halo mass functions were expected to differ .",
    "however , it is remarkable that both have a power - law range and that the constant exponent that appears with our definition is a limit case of the press - schechter mass function . in any event",
    ", we must point out that the exponent @xmath254 for equal - size halos is _ independent of the initial power spectrum _ , in accord with the nonlinear nature of the multifractal .",
    "the mass function of halos is bifractal ( a power law ) , but the calculation of the multifractal spectrum through moments for cell sizes larger than @xmath179 shows convergence towards a convex , lognormal - like spectrum ( sect .  [ mf - spec ] ) .",
    "we conclude that , at the halo - size scale @xmath179 , the mass discretization does not allow for a good sampling of halos and allows for almost no sampling of voids .",
    "poorly sampled halos mainly reflect the measure s concentrate .",
    "therefore , the power law is merely a linear approximation to the full mass function near the measure s concentrate . in this regard ,",
    "let us remark that , in a multifractal that is scale invariant on ever decreasing scales , the _ total _ mass concentrates in the set such that @xmath91 .",
