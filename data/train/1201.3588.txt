    "in the dust model we consider : _ large _ ( @xmath2 m ) silicate ( draine 2003 ) and amorphous carbon ( zubko et al .",

    ", we apply a power law size distribution : @xmath4 and absorption and scattering cross - sections are computed with mie theory .",
    "in addition we include _ pahs _ with 30 and 200 c atoms . for the absorption cross section ( draine ( 2010 ) , malloci ( 2010 ) , verstraete ( 2010 ) )",

    "we scale the photo - absorption cross section of pah up to the kev region to similar sized graphite particles . by computing cross sections above 100ev , we consider an approximation of kinetic energy losses ( dwek & smith ( 1996 ) and apply it to all dust particles . with the advent of _ iso _ and _ spitzer _ more pah emission features and more details of their band structures are detected ( tielens 2008 ) .",

    "parameters are listed in siebenmorgen & krgel ( 2001 ) and calibrated using mid - ir spectra of starburst nuclei . for starburst galaxies ,",
    "a sed library is computed ( siebenmorgen et al .",
    "2007 ) and those models provide good fits to the sed of local galaxies and to pah detected at high red shifts ( @xmath5 , efstathiou & siebenmorgen 2009 ) . in the model , we use dust abundances of [ x]/[h ] ( ppm ) of : 31 for [ si ] , 150 [ amorphous c ] , 50 [ graphite ] and 30 [ pah ] , respectively ; which is in agreement with cosmic abundance constrains ( asplund et al .",
    "we are in the process of upgrading the model to be consistent with the polarisation of the ism ( voshchinnikov 2004 ) .",
    "we compute the radiative transfer with a monte carlo ( mc ) technique , which allows to handle complicated geometries , by following the flight path of many random photons .",
    "the basic ideas of our method go back to lucy ( 1999 ) and bjorkmann & wood ( 2001 ) .",
    "they are described and extended to the treatment of transiently heated pahs in krgel ( 2006 ) .",
    "the space is partitioned into cubes and , where a finer grid is needed , the cubes are further divided into subcubes ( cells ) .",
    "the star emits photon packages of constant energy @xmath6 , but different frequencies .",
    "a package entering on its flight path a cell may be absorbed there or scattered .",
    "the probability for such an interaction is given by the extinction optical depth along the path within the cell .",
    "when the package is scattered , it only changes direction determined in a probabilistic manner by the phase function . when it is absorbed , a new package of the same energy , but usually different frequency @xmath7 is emitted from the spot of absorption .",
    "the emission is isotropic .",
    "each absorption event raises the energy of the cell by @xmath6 , and accordingly its temperature .",
    "we were able to increase the computational speed of the code by up to two orders of magnitude by parallelizing it , i.e.  by calculating the flight paths of a hundred or more photons simultaneously .",
    "this allows the treatment of complex geometries which were so far prohibited because of their excessive computer demands . to achieve parallelization",
    ", we had to slightly modify the original code .",
    "the latter calculates the new frequency @xmath7 of a package that is emitted after absorption using the cell temperature before absorption , but applies a correction for the new temperature due to bjorkmann & wood ( 2001 ) .",
    "we now omit this correction or in , mathematical terms , use eqn.(11.67 ) instead of eqn.(11.65 ) in krgel ( 2006 ) .",
    "as expected and borne out in tests , the correction may be neglected when the number of photons absorbed in a cell is not small .",
    "the vectorized mc code was developed during the phd project of heymann ( 2010 ) .",
    "it was verified against benchmarks provided for stellar heated dust spheres by ivezic et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , the ray tracing code by krgel ( 2006 ) and axi  symmetrical disks by pascucci et al .",
    "generally , the computed sed agrees with the benchmarks to within a few percent .",
    "one example of such comparisons is shown in fig .  [ sed.ps ] for a dust sphere with pahs .",
    "the factor by which parallelization speeds up the computation scales almost linearly with the number of graphical processing units .",

    "the optical depth along the midplane from 0.2 to 75au is 10mag .",

    "2010 ) mounted at a future 42 m extreme large telescope ( elt ) ; a project under study by eso .",
    "the point spread function ( psf ) of the elt has resolution of 50milliarcsec at 10@xmath9 m . in order to improve the contrast between star and disk",
    ", the instrument will provide coronographic and dual band imaging modes .",
    "we choose band passes at 11.3 and 10@xmath9 m .",
    "the 11.3@xmath9 m emission is shown in fig.[metis.ps ] together with the flux profile along the major axis .",
    "profiles of such a disk with and without pahs and that of a homogeneous disk are computed .",
    "the 3@xmath8 detection limit after 1h integration is given assuming background limited performance of the instrument .",
    "the models predict that the detailed structure of such a proto - planetary disk can be well detected .",
    "despite the fact that from the stellar heating one would expect to detect pah in the disks of t tauri , one find them rather seldom , in less than 10% of t tauri ( geers et al . , 2006 ) .",
    "in order to explain this fact we present a simplified scheme to estimate the location from the primary heating source at which the pah molecules become photo - stable ( siebenmorgen & krgel 2010 ) .",
    "t tauri stars have beside photospheric emission also a far ultraviolet ( fuv ) , an extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) and an x  ray component with a fractional luminosity of about 1% , 0.1% and 0.025% , respectively .",
    "such hard photons are very efficient in dissociating pahs .",
    "the temperature distribution , @xmath10 , of pahs after hard photon absorption is shown in fig .",
    "[ pt.ps ] .",
    "it demonstrates that @xmath10 depends strongly on the hardness and spectral shape of the exciting radiation field , a fact which is often neglected in computations of the pah emission .",
    "after photon absorption , a highly vibrationally excited pah may relax through emission of ir photons or , if sufficiently excited , lose atoms ( omont ( 1986 ) , and tielens ( 2005 ) for a textbook description ) .",
    "we find that hard photons ( euv and x - ray ) would destroy all pahs in the disk of t tauri stars ; whereas soft photons with energies @xmath11ev dissociate pahs only up to short distances from the star ( 12 au ) . as a possible path for pah - survival turbulent vertical motions are suggested",
    ". they can replenish or remove pahs from the reach of hard photons . in our treatment the presence of gas is considered which is ionized at the top of the disk and neutral at lower levels .",
