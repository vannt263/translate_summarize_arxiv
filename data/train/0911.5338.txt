    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is an extremely interesting mathematical structure which arose in theoretical papers more than 30 years ago independently by golfand and likhtman  @xcite , volkov and akulov  @xcite and wess and zumino  @xcite .",
    "the supersymmetry algebra was introduced in  @xcite",
    ". there and in the wess - zumino article  @xcite , the supersymmetry generator @xmath2 relates bosons with fermions in the usual sense .",
    "the volkov - akulov article , however , deals only with fermions .",
    "the supersymmetry generator acts in a non - linear way , turning a fermion field into a composite bosonic one made of two fermion fields  @xcite .",
    "this illustrates that the supersymmetric algebra by itself does not require superpartners  in contrast with what is commonly said or thought now .    since that time many papers have appeared .",
    "this remarkable activity is due to the unique mathematical nature of supersymmetric theories , which provide possible solutions for various problems of the sm within its supersymmetric extensions , opening the perspective for a unification of all interactions in the framework of a single theory  @xcite .",
    "there are no direct indications on existence of supersymmetry in particle physics , however there are a number of theoretical and phenomenological issues that the sm fails to address adequately :    * unification with gravity ; the point is that susy algebra being a generalization of poincar algebra @xcite : @xmath3 = 0 .   \\label{e12b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , an anticommutator of two susy transformations is a local coordinate translation .",
    "and a theory which is invariant under the general coordinate transformation is general relativity .",

    "unification of gauge couplings ; according to _ hypothesis _ of grand unification theory ( gut ) all gauge couplings change with energy .",
    "all known interactions are the branches of a single interaction associated with a simple gauge group which includes the group of the sm . to reach this goal one has to examine how the coupling change with energy . considerating the evolution of the inverse couplings",

    "therefore , it provides a solution to the hierarchy problem by protecting the electroweak scale from large radiative corrections @xcite .",

    "this triggers spontaneous breaking of @xmath12 symmetry .",
    "the vacuum expectations of the higgs fields acquire nonzero values and provide masses to fermions and gauge bosons , and additional masses to their superpartners @xcite .",
    "thus the breaking of the electroweak symmetry is not introduced by brute force as in the sm , but appears naturally from the radiative corrections .",
    "however susy seemed , in the early days , clearly inappropriate for a description of our physical world , for obvious and less obvious reasons , which often tend to be forgotten , now that we got so accustomed to deal with supersymmetric extensions of the sm .",
    "following @xcite , on this article , we first we recall the obstacles which seemed , long ago , to prevent susy from possibly being a fundamental symmetry of nature .    starting in the early 1980 s",

    "our second goal is to present a review about the construction of the supersymmetrics extensions of the sm , as well we present the earliest experimental search to susy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : prob ] we present the main difficulties in constructing phenomenological supersymmetric extensions of the sm , with their solutions in secs .",
    "[ sec : hrcmssm ] and [ sec : ovn ] .",
    "[ sec : ess ] is a short review of early experimental searches for susy .",
    "appendices deal with @xmath15-symmetry and feynman rules in the strong sector of supersymmetric extensions of the standard model .",
    "we review here some obstacles which seemed , long ago , to prevent susy from being a fundamental symmetry of nature .",
    "the first crucial question we can formulate , if susy is to be relevant in particle physics , is :    * which bosons and fermions could be related by susy ?",
    "+ there seems to be no answer since wew know more bosons than fermions . by another hand",
    ", they do not appear to have much in common .",
    "maybe , susy could act at the level of composite objects , e.g. as relating baryons with mesons ? + we remind that in november 1974 a new vector meson was discovered independently by two groups in brookhaven and stanford ( usa ) , denoted by @xmath16 or @xmath17 , now generally called @xmath18 .",
    "the true nature of this particle was the subject of lively debates , with the final explanation provided by the quark model .",
    "the @xmath18 is a bound state of a new quark , @xmath19 ( for charm ) , with @xmath20 .",
    "+ in the quark model there are more baryons ( composed of three quarks with half - integer spin , obeying fermi - dirac statistics ) than mesons ( composed of a quark and an antiquark , with integer spin , and obeying bose - einstein statistics ) . in the original eightfold way proposed by murray gell - mann in 1961 , there are 18 baryons forming an octet and a decuplet , and 8 mesons . with four quarks @xmath21 and @xmath19 , the difference between these numbers gets bigger .",
    "+ we might try to relate baryons and mesons , but what to do with the baryons `` in excess '' ?",
    "it was thus realized that it would be very difficult to relate them through the supersymmetric algebra : how could we deal with the fact that there are more baryons than mesons ?",
    "+ this leads to ask : should supersymmetry act at a fundamental level , i.e. at the level of leptons , quarks and gauge bosons ?",
    "we can try do it , possibly with the help of the idea , tentatively pursued in @xcite , that the photon could be related with the neutrino , as both are massless ( or almost massless ) and have no electric charge . + but how do we know that the solution is like that ?",
    "the answer is in fact that it is not ... however , if we try to follow this way for a while we arrive to another problem .",
    "the known leptons and quarks are dirac fermions carrying conserved baryon number ( @xmath22 ) and lepton number ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "all observed processes in nature respect conservation laws for @xmath22 and @xmath24 .",
    "+ in the beginning of 1974 , only two fermion families were known and not even complete with the charm quark still to be discovered .",
    "neutral current effects had just been discovered the year before , in 1973 , with very little information available about the structure of the weak neutral current ( or currents ? ) . and the lower limit on the mass of the postulated charged @xmath25 boson was something like 5 gev .",
    "the standard model was a recent theoretical construction , far from `` standard '' yet in today s sense ; its @xmath26 and @xmath27 bosons , of course hypothetical , were considered as really very heavy . and",
    "even - more - hypothetical higgs fields were generally viewed as a technical device to trigger or mimic the spontaneous breaking of the gauge symmetry .",
    "+ in addition , one had to face the question : * how could one define ( conserved ) baryon and lepton numbers in a supersymmetric theory ?",
    "this appeared especially difficult as @xmath22 and @xmath23 are known to be carried by fundamental fermions only , not bosons ... + the translation generator ( momentum ) @xmath28 appears in the supersymmetric algebra , see eq.([e12b ] ) , in agreement with lorentz covariance .",
    "therefore , susy is a space - time symmetry and it is independent of all internal symmetries .",
    "this meant thet the generators of supersymmetric transformations commutes with the generator of any internal symmetries . + this will lead us to attribute baryon and lepton numbers also to fundamental bosons , now called squarks and sleptons , as well as to fundmanetal fermions .",
    "nowadays we are so used to deal with spin-0 squarks and sleptons , carrying baryon and lepton numbers almost by definition , that we can hardly imagine this could once have appeared as a problem .",
    "+ attributing baryon and lepton numbers to bosons as well as to fermions , however , could lead to an immediate disaster , preventing us from getting a theory that conserve @xmath22 and @xmath23 quantum numbers .",
    "this may be formulated through the question : * how can we avoid unwanted interactions mediated by spin-0 squark and slepton exchanges ? + this problem , in fact , can be avoided thanks to @xmath15-parity .",
    "the @xmath15-symmetry was introduced in 1975 by p. fayet @xcite within a first @xmath29 electroweak theory ( see also a. salam and j. strathdee in @xcite ) , then extended to the gauge interactions of quark and lepton superfields , and to their superpotential interactions with the two doublet higgs superfields now known as @xmath30 and @xmath31 in @xcite .",
    "this continuous @xmath15 symmetry , later reduced to its discrete @xmath15-parity subgroup , allows for @xmath22 and @xmath23 conservation laws by forbidding unwanted superpotential interactions that would violate either baryon or lepton number conservation laws ( or both ) .",
    "nice reviews may be found in @xcite .",
    "we show in appendix  [ apen : rsymmetry ] that the terms @xmath32 used in the construction of supersymmetric lagrangian densities , are invariant under the continuous @xmath15 symmetry provided @xmath33 , @xmath34 being the @xmath15-index of the superfield @xmath35 .",
    "+ the great success of the standard model with its broken @xmath36 symmetry has convinced of the usefulness of broken symmetries .",
    "unfortunately it is not easy to break susy spontaneously .",
    "one problem follows directly from the susy algebra itself , which implies that the energy is always non - negative definite ( at least in global susy models ) .",
    "indeed , @xmath37 and due to the susy algebra , see eq.([e12b ] ) , we can write @xmath38 as @xmath39 one gets formally @xmath40 hence @xmath41 + according to this argument , susy would be spontaneously broken , with the vacuum state not invariant under susy ( i.e. @xmath42 ) , if and only if the minimum of the potential is strictly positive , corresponding to a positive energy density .",
    "but on the other hand _ a supersymmetric vacuum state must have vanishing energy , and is therefore necessarily stable ! _ + it thus seemed that susy could not be spontaneously broken at all , which would imply that bosons and fermions be systematically degenerated in mass . commutes with @xmath2 and @xmath43 , see eq.([e12b ] ) , the mass of a particle is the same within a supermultiplet representation . ]",
    "this is clearly not realistic , as there is no boson with the same mass 511 kev as the electron , nor with the same mass 106 mev as the muon , etc , unless of course susy breaking terms are explicitly introduced `` by hand '' .",
    "this leads to the question : * is spontaneous susy breaking possible at all ? + the answer is yes but it is not so easy .",
    "spontaneous breaking of susy may be achieved in a way somewhat similar to the electroweak symmetry breaking , with a field whose vacuum expectation value ( vev ) is non - zero and breaks spontaneously the symmetry .",
    "+ due to the special character of susy , this field should be one ( or a combination ) of the auxiliary @xmath44 or @xmath45 field - components of superfields .",
    "one must then be able to arrange , and this is the difficult point , so that one at least of these auxiliary fields acquires a non - vanishing vev , although they all tend to reach as much as possible a point at which they would vanish , so as to minimize the energy .",
    "+ among possible spontaneous susy breaking mechanisms one distinguishes the @xmath44 and @xmath45 ones .",

    "+ in this case the , the linear @xmath45-term is added to the lagrangian @xmath46 it is gauge and susy invariant by itself .",
    "+ when this mechanism is applied to supersymmetric extensions of the standard model , the resulting mass spectrum is problematic , due in particular to the following sum rule @xmath47 valid in a @xmath48 gauge theory ( at the classical level ) , and in particular in the quark subsector @xcite .",
    "this would prevent one to make all squarks ( and sleptons ) heavy , at the classical level , unless one extends the gauge group to include an extra @xmath49 factor beyond @xmath48 .",
    "+ \\ii ) @xmath44-breaking mechanism , due to fayet @xcite and oraifeartaigh @xcite .",
    "+ several chiral superfields are needed for that purpose and the superpotential should be chosen very carefully , with additional restrictions as generally provided by an @xmath15 symmetry , to avoid the otherwise quasi - systematic presence of supersymmetric vacuum states in which all auxiliary components would vanish .",
    "for instance , choosing the superpotential @xcite @xmath50 one gets the equations for the auxiliary fields @xmath51 which have no solution with @xmath52 , so that susy is spontaneously broken . +",
    "this mechanism necessitates the introduction of a completely new sector for the breaking of the supersymmetry , which leads a lot of arbitrariness in the superpotential and resulting potential .",
    "the sum rule ( [ sumrule ] ) is also valid here ( up to radiative corrections ) .",
    "+ unfortunately , none of these mechanisms may be used directly in a satisfactory way in the minimal versions of susy extensions of the sm , owing also to the difficulty of generating spontaneously sufficiently large gluino masses in these models @xcite . until today",
    ", spontaneous susy breaking leading to an acceptable mass spectrum remains , in general , rather difficult to obtain at least within global supersymmetry .",
    "we thus generally parametrize our ignorance about the true mechanism of susy breaking chosen by nature to make superpartners heavy by introducing in the lagrangian density additional terms breaking the supersymmetry explicitly , but _ softly _ , in the sense that they do not reintroduce quadratic divergencies in the theory .",
    "these terms are @xcite * * gaugino mass terms @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the group index ; * * scalar mass terms @xmath55 ; * * trilinear scalar interactions @xmath56 ; * * and bilinear terms @xmath57 are also allowed , where @xmath58 is a gauge singlet field . ] .",
    "+ of course just accepting the possibility of explicit susy breaking without worrying too much about the origin of susy breaking terms makes things much easier  but also at the price of introducing a large number of arbitrary parameters , coefficients of these supersymmetry - breaking terms .",
    "if we allow all the new parameters introduced above to be complex in the minimal supersymmetric standard model we would be dealing with some 124 unknown real constants , 19 of which are already in the sm while 105 are new . +",
    "before introducing these soft terms and deal in this way with supersymmetry breaking , there was another related question : * where is the spin-@xmath59 goldstone fermion of susy ?",

    "it also introduced @xmath15-invariance .",
    "this continuous @xmath72-invariance was interpreted at the time as associated with lepton number conservation ( quarks were not considered in this article ) , @xmath73 and @xmath74 having `` lepton number '' @xmath75 , and @xmath76 and @xmath77 @xmath78 .",

    "later , in 1976 , it was generalized to also include baryonic number conservation .",
    "then the role of the @xmath15-invariance were to avoid the scalar particle exchange in @xmath79 and @xmath80-decay as analysed in 1977 @xcite . since that time , we associate the conservation of @xmath15-invariance with the conservation of lepton and baryon number .",
    "since the new bosons carrying electronic , muonic or baryonic number are all heavy , these quantum numbers effectively appear as carried by fermions only at low energies .",
