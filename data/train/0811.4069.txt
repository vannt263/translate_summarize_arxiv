    "understanding the recent acceleration of the universe is a challenge and a landmark problem in physics .",
    "its resolution may affect in the short term our understanding of a fundamental interaction like gravity as well as enlarge the framework of particle physics .",
    "the smoking gun of the acceleration of the universe ( if we assume it is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales ) was provided by the analysis of the hubble diagram of sne ia a decade ago @xcite .",
    "this discovery , together with ( i ) the measurement of the fluctuations in the cmb which implied that the universe is ( quasi ) spatially flat and ( ii ) that the amount of matter which clusters gravitationally is much less than the critical energy density , implied the existence of a `` dark energy component '' that drives the late - time acceleration of the universe .",
    "subsequent precision measurements of the cmb anisotropy by wmap @xcite and the power spectrum of galaxy clustering by the 2dfgrs and sdss surveys @xcite have confirmed this discovery .",
    "a plethora of different theoretical models have been so far proposed to explain this phenomenon @xcite , although unfortunately none of the models advanced so far is both completely convincing and well motivated .",
    "a cosmological constant corresponding to roughly two thirds of the total energy density of the universe is perhaps the simplest _ phenomenological _ way to explain the late - time speed up of the universe and in addition match rather well the observational data .",
    "however , the expected theoretical value of the cosmological constant is about 120 orders of magnitude larger than the value needed to fit the data @xcite .",
    "alternative approaches to explain the late - time acceleration invoke ( i ) a dark energy component in the universe which would provide a negative pressure or ( ii ) an infrared modification of general relativity on large scales ( like in some brane - world scenarios @xcite or f(r ) models @xcite ) which , by weakening the gravitational interaction on those scales , allows the recent speed up of the universal expansion .",
    "the second approach is also motivated by the fact that we only have precise measurements of gravity from sub - millimiter scales up to solar system scales while the hubble radius , which is the scale relevant for the cosmic acceleration , is many orders of magnitude larger .",
    "a pioneering scheme in the second approach is the dvali , gabadadze and porrati ( dgp ) model @xcite which corresponds to a 5-dimensional ( 5d ) induced gravity brane - world model @xcite , where a low - energy modification occurs with respect to general relativity ; i.e. an infrared effect takes place , leading to two branches of solutions : ( i ) the self - accelerating branch and ( ii ) the normal branch .",
    "the self - accelerating branch solution gives rise to an asymptotically de sitter brane ; i.e. a late - time accelerating brane universe",
    ". the acceleration of the brane expansion arises naturally , i.e. without invoking the presence of any dark energy on the brane to produce the speed - up .",
    "most importantly , it has recently been shown that by embedding the dgp model in a higher dimensional space - time the ghost problem in the original model @xcite may be cured @xcite while preserving the existence of a self - accelerating solution @xcite .",
    "the normal branch also constitutes in itself an extremely interesting physical setup of the dgp model however , as it can mimic a phantom behaviour on the brane by means of the @xmath0dgp scenario @xcite .",
    "we would like to highlight that observational data do not seem incompatible with a phantom - like behaviour @xcite and therefore we should keep an open mind about what is producing the recent inflationary era of our universe .",
    "furthermore , this phantom - like behaviour may well be a property acquired only recently by dark energy .",
    "this leads to an interest in modelling the so called crossing of the phantom divide line @xmath1 ; for example in the context of the brane - world scenario @xcite .",
    "the most important aspect of the @xmath0dgp model is that the phantom - like mimicry is obtained without invoking any real phantom - matter @xcite which is known to violate the null energy condition and induce quantum instabilities @xcite . in the dgp scenario",
    "it is as well possible to get a mimicry of the crossing of the phantom divide , however , at the cost of invoking a dynamical dark energy on the brane @xcite , for example modelled by a quiessence fluid or a ( generalised ) chaplygin gas .",
    "one aim of this paper is to show that a dilatonic brane - world model with an induced gravity term in the brane can mimic a phantom - like behaviour without including matter on the brane that violates the null energy condition .",
    "a second aim of this paper is to show that there is an alternative form ( to the one introduced in @xcite ) of mimicking the crossing the cosmological constant line @xmath1 in the brane - world scenario .",
    "more precisely , we consider a 5d dilatonic bulk with a brane endowed with an induced gravity term , a brane matter content corresponding to cold dark matter , and a brane tension @xmath2 that depends on the minimally coupled bulk scalar field .",
    "we will show that in this set - up the vacuum generalised self - accelerating branch expands in a super - accelerating way and mimics a phantom - behaviour .",
    "on the other hand , the generalised normal branch expands in an accelerated way due to @xmath2 playing the role of _ dark energy _ through its dependence on the bulk scalar field .",
    "furthermore , in this case , it turns out that the brane tension grows with the brane scale factor until it reaches a maximum positive value and then starts decreasing .",
    "therefore , in our model the brane tension mimics a crossing of the phantom divide .",
    "most importantly no matter violating the null energy density is invoked in our model .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we present our dilatonic brane - world model with induced gravity .",
    "the bulk scalar field potential is an exponential potential .",
    "the matter content of the brane is coupled to the dilaton field .",
    "we deduce the modified friedmann equation for both branches , the junction condition of the dilaton across the brane , which constrains the brane tension , and the energy balance on the brane . in section 3 , we then analyse the vacuum ( i.e. , @xmath3 ) solutions in both branches .",
    "we show that the brane tension has a phantom - like behaviour on the generalised self - accelerating branch in the sense that the brane tension grows as the brane expands . in this branch ,",
    "the brane hits a singularity in its future evolution which may be interpreted as a `` big rip '' singularity pushed towards an infinite cosmic time .",
    "then , in section 4 , we show that , under some assumptions on the nature of the coupling parameters between @xmath2 and @xmath4 , @xmath5 changes sign as the normal brane evolves , with @xmath6 the effective equation of state for the brane tension .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section 5 .",
    "we consider a brane , described by a 4d hyper - surface ( @xmath7 , metric g ) , embedded in a 5d bulk space - time ( @xmath8 , metric @xmath9 ) , whose action is given by @xmath10\\;+\\;\\mathcal{l}_5\\right\\}%\\nonumber \\\\",

    "the term @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( [ l4 ] ) describes the matter content of the brane and @xmath21 is the brane tension , and we will restrict ourselves to the case where they are homogeneous and isotropic on the brane .",
    "we allow the brane matter content to be non - minimally coupled on the ( 5d ) einstein frame but to be minimally coupled respect to a conformal metric @xmath22 , where @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the cosmology of this model .",
    "it is known that for an expanding flrw brane the unique bulk space - time in einstein gravity ( in vacuum ) is a 5d schwarzschild - anti de sitter space - time .",
    "this property as far as we know can not be extended to a 5d dilatonic bulk .",
    "on the other hand , the presence of an induced gravity term in the brane - world scenario affects only the dynamics of the brane , through the junction conditions at the brane , and does not affect the bulk field equations .",
    "therefore , in order to study the effect of an induced gravity term in a brane - world dilatonic model , it is possible to consider a bulk corresponding to a dilatonic 5d space - time and later on impose the junction conditions at the brane location .",
    "the junction conditions will then determine the cosmological evolution of the brane and constrain the brane tension .",
    "this is the approach we will follow .    from now on ,",
    "we consider a 5d dilatonic solution obtained by feinstein et al @xcite _ without an induced gravity term on the brane_. the 5d dilatonic solution reads @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a 3d spatially flat metric .",

    "the brane is considered to be embedded in the previous 5d dilatonic solution and its trajectory in the bulk is described by the following parametrisation @xmath32 here @xmath33 corresponds to the brane proper time .",
    "then the brane metric reads @xmath34 for an induced gravity brane - world model @xcite , there are two physical ways of embedding the brane in the bulk when a @xmath35-symmetry across the brane is assumed : the generalised normal branch and the generalised self - accelerating branch .",
    "for example , in the first case the brane is moving in the bulk away from the bulk naked singularity located at @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "for simplicity , we will consider that the matter content of the brane is minimally coupled respect to the conformal metric @xmath37 ; i.e. @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is a constant .",
    "we will also consider only the case but on the sign of the parameter @xmath40 .",

    "@xmath42 ; i.e. the scalar field is a growing function of the coordinate @xmath30 .",

    "the analytical proof has been confirmed by numerical solutions .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that for some values of the parameters the normal branch inflates eternally to the future due to the brane tension @xmath2 playing the role of dark energy through its dependence on the bulk scalar field .    in summary , in the models presented here the mimicry of a phantom - like behaviour and the phantom divide crossing is based on the interaction between the brane and the bulk through the brane tension that depends explicitly on the scalar field that lives in the bulk .",
    "we have also shown that in both cases the brane undergoes a late - time acceleration epoch .",
