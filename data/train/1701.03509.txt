    "th : charact_sid_f_omega : pt ] of theorem  [ th : charact_sid_f_omega ] this is equivalent to a construction of a strong deformation retraction of @xmath207 onto @xmath256 . in fact , it suffices to find a retraction @xmath311 , so to associate to each @xmath107 a function @xmath312 taking constant values along orbits of @xmath55 so that each @xmath313 remains unchanged .",

    "whence for the hamiltonian flow @xmath333 of @xmath321 the corresponding tangent map @xmath334 is always the identity .",
