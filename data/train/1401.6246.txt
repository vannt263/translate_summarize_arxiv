    "the study of kinetic roughening theory and related continuous and atomistic models is motivated by the technological interest in thin films , multilayers and related nanostructures , as well as the theoretical and experimental interest in fluctuating interface problems @xcite .",
    "some important classes of interface growth are those connected to the edwards - wilkinson ( ew ) equation @xcite , in which linear interface tension is the dominant relaxation term , and to the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) equation @xcite , which includes a nonlinear effect of the local slope .",
    "recent advances in the solution of the kpz equation @xcite and some experimental realizations @xcite renewed the interest in those problems .    a relatively small number of works considered thin film and interface growth problems with time - dependent conditions @xcite , although there is a large number of experimental problems with that feature , ranging from fluid imbibition in porous media @xcite to thin film electrodeposition @xcite . many of those models and experiments show anomalous scaling of the surface roughness @xcite . a more recent application is the deposition of compositionally graded films , in which the flux of different species vary in time @xcite .",
    "this technique may improve film adhesion and reduce internal stress , among other benefits .",
    "another possibility is a sudden change in the dynamics during the interface growth .",
    "for instance , this is the case of a change from sputtering to annealing in a cycle of surface cleaning @xcite .",
    "moreover , any change from a surface cleaning process to thin film deposition on that surface may be viewed as a potential application . since erosion or dissolution are frequently present in those processes",
    ", we recall that kpz scaling was already observed in several etching and dissolution models @xcite . on the other hand , kpz scaling",
    "were also observed in @xmath15 films after high temperature annealing , with initial deposition by sputtering @xcite .",
    "thus , the apparently simple situation of a sudden change in the growth dynamics may have a variety of applications that involve kpz scaling .",
    "the problem of changes in the ew equation in dimension @xmath0 was studied in ref . @xcite and",
    "further extended to other linear growth equations in all @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "those works showed power - law relaxation of the difference @xmath7 of the square roughness of the perturbed and the unperturbed system , which measures the global response to the perturbation @xcite .",
    "this feature may be important for experimental works in which there is any sudden change in conditions such as temperature , pressure and composition , since a delay in the response to a change may affect the desired film properties .",
    "indeed , the slow relaxation referred above was observed when both the initial and the final ew dynamics were in the growth regime , which corresponds to typical experimental conditions , in contrast to the exponential relaxation observed in steady state ( very long time ) properties . on the other hand , recent works studied autoresponse functions in kpz models @xcite , which measure the average local response to a perturbation and show particular aging properties .",
    "this is an additional reason to search for a deeper understanding of the relaxation of global quantities , in particular when kpz growth is involved .",
    "the aim of this work is to study the effect of sudden changes in the ew and kpz dynamics , including changes between these different growth classes .",
    "the scaling of the global quantity @xmath7 is analyzed , with support from simulation results for a variety of lattice models in @xmath0 and @xmath1 . a previous analytical solution for the ew - ew changes",
    "is reviewed and provides the background for a simple scaling approach to the kpz - kpz changes , in which the dominant contribution to @xmath7 is predicted from a time shift in the final growth dynamics .",
    "the striking difference from local autoresponse functions is clearly shown for kpz in @xmath1 .",
    "for kpz - ew changes , crossover times significantly exceed the growth time with the initial dynamics , which is an expected general trend when a faster dynamics is changed to a slower one ( corresponding to an increase in the dynamic exponent ) .",
    "moreover , remarkable differences in ew smoothing of correlated and uncorrelated surfaces are discussed .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ models ] , we present basic definitions , the interface equations and the lattice models considered in this work . in sec . [ ewew ] , we briefly review previous analytical results on changes between initial and final ew growth , define a suitable scaling function and propose an approach to explain the simplest type of relaxation . in sec .",
    "[ kpzkpz ] , that approach is extended to changes from initial and final kpz growth . in sec .",
    "[ kpzew ] , we introduce a scaling approach for the kpz - ew changes , which are confirmed by numerical results in @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in sec . [ smoothing ] , we discuss the smoothing of very rough surfaces by ew dynamics .",
    "[ conclusion ] summarizes our results and conclusions .",
    "the simplest quantitative characteristic of an interface is its roughness ( or interface width ) .",
    "it is usually defined as the rms fluctuation of the height @xmath17 as @xmath18 } ^{1/2 } , \\label{defw}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the lateral size and @xmath20 is the growth time .",
    "the overbars in eq .",
    "( [ defw ] ) represent spatial averages and the angular brackets represent configurational averages .",
    "the roughness can be calculated from the structure factor @xmath21 as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the fourier transform of @xmath17 given by @xmath24 ( @xmath25 denotes the position in @xmath16 dimensions and @xmath26 is the wave vector ) .",
    "in interface growth processes with normal scaling ( in opposition to anomalous scaling @xcite ) , the roughness follows the family - vicsek scaling relation @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the roughness exponent , @xmath29 is a scaling function such that @xmath30 in the regime of roughness saturation ( @xmath31 ) and @xmath32 is the characteristic time of crossover to saturation . @xmath32 scales with the system size as @xmath33 where @xmath12 is the dynamic exponent . for @xmath34",

    ", the structure factor scales as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a scaling function .    in this work ,",
    "our interest is to study the interface evolution in the growth regime , with negligible finite - size effects .",
    "the roughness of the interface with a sudden change of dynamics at time @xmath3 is referred as @xmath39 and the roughness of the interface grown with the final dynamics since @xmath40 is referred as @xmath41 . the exact result for ew - ew changes in @xmath0 @xcite suggests to define a reduced time as @xmath42 a general scaling form for the roughness difference @xmath43 between the changed and unchanged systems is @xmath44 the kpz equation is @xmath45 where @xmath17 is the interface height at the position @xmath46 in a @xmath16-dimensional substrate at time @xmath20 , @xmath47 represents the surface tension , @xmath48 represents the excess velocity and @xmath49 is a gaussian noise @xcite with zero mean and co - variance @xmath50 .",
    "the ew equation @xcite corresponds to the kpz equation with @xmath51 , while uncorrelated growth ( ug ) is obtained for @xmath52 and @xmath51 .",

    "the kpz equation has @xmath57 and @xmath58 @xcite ; in @xmath1 , the best current numerical results give @xmath59 and @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "ug has @xmath61 and no roughness saturation , so that @xmath28 and @xmath12 are not defined .",
    "many lattice models share the same scaling exponents with ew or kpz equations and are said to belong to the ew or to the kpz class .",
    "these models are expected to be represented by those equations in the continuous limit ( very large sizes , very long times ) , possibly with additional higher order spatial derivatives that are irrelevant under renormalization @xcite .    in all models studied here , the growth begins with a flat substrate at @xmath40 .",
    "lattice sizes are @xmath62 in @xmath0 and @xmath63 in @xmath1 .",
    "one time unit corresponds to @xmath64 deposition trials ( deposition of one layer of particles in solid on solid models ) .",
    "maximal growth times are chosen well below the saturation regime , except if explicitly indicated .",
    "changes take place at time @xmath3 , with @xmath3 varying from @xmath65 to @xmath66 .",
    "the lattice model in the ew class studied here is the family model @xcite . at each step of this model , a column of the deposit is randomly chosen and the minimum height is searched up to a distance @xmath67 from that column . if no column in that neighborhood has a height smaller than that of the column of incidence , a new particle sticks at the top of this one",
    ". otherwise , it sticks at the top of the column with the smallest height in that neighborhood . if two or more columns have the same minimum height , the sticking position is the one closest to the incidence column and , in the case of a new draw , one of the smallest and closest columns is randomly chosen .",
    "the increase of @xmath67 corresponds to an increased interface tension compared to the noise intensity , i. e. an increase of the ratio @xmath68 in the corresponding ew equation .",
    "hereafter , the family model with searching distance @xmath67 will be referred as f@xmath67 model .",
    "the kpz models considered here are the restricted solid - on - solid ( rsos ) model @xcite and the etching model of mello et al @xcite .",
    "the latter is particularly interesting due to the large number of applications of etching processes ( by aggressive solutions , sputtering , etc ) .    in the @xmath69 model @xcite",
    ", the incident particle may stick at the top of the column of incidence if the differences of heights between the incidence column and each of the neighboring columns do not exceed @xmath70 .",
    "otherwise , the aggregation attempt is rejected .    the model for etching of a crystalline solid of mello et al @xcite is simulated here in its deposition version , hereafter called etch model .",
    "at each deposition attempt , the height of the column of incidence is increased by one unit ( @xmath71 ) and any neighboring column whose height is smaller than @xmath72 grows until its height becomes @xmath72 ( in the true etching version of this model , the columns heights decrease by the same quantities above ) .",
    "finally , the ug is simulated with aggregation at the top of the column of incidence , independently of the neighboring heights .",
    "one - dimensional ew growth with a sudden changes in the interface tension was studied by chou et al @xcite .",
    "subsequently , chou and pleimling extended that approach to changes in interface tension and noise amplitude in any dimension @xcite .",
    "considering initial dynamics with parameters @xmath73 and the final one with @xmath74 , the difference in the square roughness can be written as @xcite @xmath75 with @xmath76 with this form , @xmath77 . if the initial and the final dynamics are in the growth regime at times @xmath3 and @xmath20 , respectively , then @xmath78 .",
    "the lowest nonzero order in the expansion of @xmath79 depends on the type of change : if only @xmath80 is changed ( @xmath81 ) , then it is first order in @xmath82 ; if only @xmath47 changes ( @xmath83 ) , the leading order is the second one . in any case , @xmath84 can be written in terms of the scaling variable @xmath85 [ see eq .",

    "this condition typically corresponds to a very large initial interface tension , which produces a smooth surface that rapidly brings the interface to a steady state of very low roughness . in lattice models ,",
    "this is illustrated by the change f50-f1 , which is shown in fig .",
    "the best data collapse is obtained with @xmath103 and the slope of the plot is close to @xmath104 ( some deviations appearring only for @xmath101 at long times , in which the accuracy of @xmath7 is low ) .    the form of @xmath108 in eq .",
    "( [ dgewew ] ) helps to understand this result .",
    "the first contribution to @xmath108 vanishes in the saturation regime of the f50 model and , consequently , @xmath109 is of first order for small @xmath110 .",
    "it gives @xmath89 and @xmath111 , in agreement with the numerical estimates .",
    "this is similar to the case of changing the noise amplitude , although in f50-f1 we understand that only a change in interface tension is present .",
    "an equivalent reasoning that leads to a first order dominant term in @xmath108 and its corresponding exponents is to assume that @xmath84 is dominated by a difference of roughnesses of the final dynamics with starting times @xmath112 and @xmath3 .",
    "this gives    @xmath113    since @xmath114 for ew growth @xcite , we obtain @xmath88 and @xmath115 .",
    "this is certainly a good approximation when the roughness at @xmath116 is very small , which is the case of the f50 model .",
    "however , it also applies when the initial roughness is not small . in this case",
    ", the initial and final dynamics have the same dynamic exponent @xmath12 , thus the initial correlations , created in a time @xmath3 , are changed by the final dynamics in a time of the same order .",
    "for this reason , @xmath117 is approximately related to a difference of starting times of order @xmath3 . in this context , the case @xmath83 , @xmath118 can be understood as a particular case in which this first order correction vanishes and a more rapid decay is observed .",
    "the relaxation of @xmath119 in the integrated kpz equation in @xmath0 was formerly studied by chou and pleimling @xcite , who obtained the scaling relation ( [ defcgamma ] ) with @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",

    "this is equivalent to assume that the scaling of @xmath7 is not dominated by coupling of different modes ( while in ew scaling there is no mode coupling at all ) .",

    "we also note that any other assumption for the leading order of @xmath150 would provide different exponents .",

    "( [ dw2kpzkpz ] ) with @xmath151 ] leads to the correct exponents for the kpz - kpz decay .",
    "this is not an actual calculation for kpz , but may motivate the development of rigorous approaches for the subject .",
    "now we consider a problem not addressed in previous works , which mainly corresponds to turning in or turning off the nonlinearity in ew - kpz or kpz - ew changes , respectively .",
    "since kpz correlations are spread faster than ew correlations ( e. g. @xmath154 and @xmath155 in @xmath0 @xcite ) , the correlation length of kpz growth at @xmath156 is much larger than the correlation length of ew growth .",
    "thus , in a change ew - kpz , the time @xmath157 necessary for the kpz growth to supress the initial ew correlations is smaller than @xmath3 .",
    "this leads to a crossover scaling similar to the kpz - kpz changes discussed in sec .",
    "[ kpzkpz ] .    on the other hand , if the initial dynamics is kpz , the time necessary for the correlations at @xmath116 to be replaced by ew correlations will be significantly larger than @xmath3 .",
    "a suitable scaling approach has to be developed , along the same lines of related approaches for ew - kpz crossover of roughness scaling @xcite .",
    "hereafter we refer to the scaling exponents of the initial dynamics with subindex @xmath137 ( @xmath11 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 ) and to those of the final dynamics with no subindex , so that the approach may be easily extended to other growth classes .    at time @xmath3 , the correlation length of the kpz interface is @xmath160 and the square roughness is @xmath161 for @xmath162 , the final dynamics is so that @xmath163 , given that @xmath164 , which is always the case in kpz - ew changes .",

    "the predicted relaxation exponent for ug - ew is @xmath213 ( second order in @xmath214 ) and the relaxation exponent for kpz - ew is @xmath215 , which suggest a faster decay of @xmath7 in the former .",
    "an additional reason for the delay in the latter is the larger crossover time @xmath216",
    ".    these results may be very important for the growth of thin films in rough substrates , particularly when there is some initial pattern or correlated roughness .",
    "an investigation of these features in diffusion dominated growth is certainly desirable .",
    "the relaxation of the roughness of an interface after a sudden change in the dynamics involving ew and kpz growth was studied numerically with lattice models and via scaling arguments .",
    "all changes were considered in the growth regimes of those models , so that power law relaxation is observed in the square roughness difference @xmath7 between the changed and the unperturbed systems .",
    "the previous analytical solutions for the ew - ew changes are reviewed and leads to a definition of a function @xmath214 that contains the basic information on the type of change of the parameters of the ew equation .",
    "changes in the noise amplitude , with constant interface tension , give a leading term @xmath217 ( first order ) , while changes only in the interface tension give second order dominant term in @xmath218 .",
    "the first scaling is also realized when the initial roughness is very small compared to the unperturbed growth . a hypothesis that @xmath7 is dominated by a time shift of the final dynamics is introduced and matches that scaling .",
    "the general form of @xmath7 in ew - ew changes is extended to kpz - kpz changes , which implies the assumption that @xmath7 is not dominated by coupling of different modes .",
    "the corresponding function @xmath214 is also assumed to be of first order . the predicted relaxation exponents are in good agreement with simulation results in @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "comparison with the recently calculated aging properties of local response functions show significant differences from the present global response in @xmath1 .",
    "kpz - ew changes are cases in which a faster dynamics is changed to a slower one , corresponding to an increase in the dynamic exponent .",
    "thus , the time of crossover to the final dynamics is much larger than the time @xmath3 of growth with the initial dynamics .",
    "we introduce a scaling approach for the relaxation in those changes , which is also in good agreement with numerical results in @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the hypothesis of @xmath7 dominated by a time shift of the final dynamics fails in @xmath1 due to the very small ew roughness .",
    "we also compared ew smoothing of initially correlated ( kpz ) and uncorrelated surfaces to illustrate the much slower relaxation in the former",
    ". this may be relevant for thin film growth in rough substrates and may motivate future studies of the same type of sudden change in growth dominated by surface diffusion ."
