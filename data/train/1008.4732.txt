    "after the successful experimental realization of two - species bose - einstein condensate ( tbec ) , consisting of different hyperfine spin states of @xmath0rb @xcite , experimental as well as theoretical investigations in this field have come a long way .",
    "tbecs of different atomic species ( @xmath1k and @xmath0rb ) @xcite and of different isotopes of same atomic species ( @xmath2rb and @xmath0rb ) have been experimentally observed .",
    "phase separation , a typical feature of two component bose - einstein condensates , has been observed unambiguously @xcite .",
    "a lot of static as well as dynamical properties of the tbecs have been analyzed in great detail in recent years .",
    "these include the ground state geometry @xcite , modulational instability @xcite , rayleigh - taylor instability @xcite,@xcite , kelvin - helmholtz instability @xcite , etc ..    the ground state geometry of the tbec has been studied , semi - analytically , using thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation @xcite .",
    "these works did not take into account the contribution of the interface energy explicitly .",
    "the interface energy was taken into account in some other works @xcite ; however , the interface energy correction incorporated in these works was not good enough to reproduce the experimentally observed ground state structures with planar interface @xcite .",
    "a more accurate analytic approximation to account for interface energy was suggested by schaeybroeck et al .",
    "@xcite , and a recent work @xcite conclusively proved that using this analytic approximation for interface energy in tf regime , planar and cylindrical geometries emerge as the ground state structures in cigar and pan - cake shaped trap potentials .",
    "the common salient feature of all these works is the use of tf approximation , which is a good approximation for large number of atoms of each species .",
    "in fact if @xmath3 , and @xmath4 are respectively , number of atoms of the component species , s - wave scattering length , and oscillator length , tf approximation is valid provided @xmath5 . obviously , this condition is not satisfied for attractive condensates . for small number of atoms",
    "as well , say of the order of a few hundreds , and for very weakly interacting condensates ( @xmath6 ) , the contribution of the kinetic energy to the total energy is significant and can not be merely treated as a correction to total energy as is done in tf based approaches . for such tbecs ,",
    "tf approximation is not a good approximation , and hence can not be relied upon to determine the ground state structure of the tbec . in present work , we analyze the ground sate properties of the tbecs using suitable ansatz in both miscible and immiscible regimes .",
    "the gaussian nature of the ansatz makes our approach better equipped to study the stationary state properties of the of very weakly interacting ( @xmath7 ) tbecs and also those with attractive interactions . with the advent of feshbach resonances",
    "@xcite , it is experimentally possible to tune scattering lengths to reach the very weakly interacting regime or even non - interacting regime @xcite .",
    "magnetic feshbach resonances can tune only one scattering length independently , whereas optical feshbach resonances @xcite open up the possibility of tuning different scattering length in a multicomponent system independently . with",
    "the experimental observation of optical feshbach resonances in @xmath8yb@xcite and @xmath9yb @xcite , experimental realization of weakly interacting regime in binary condensates appears a distinct possibility .",
    "the present approach , thus , supplements tf based semi - analytic schemes to determine the ground state geometries of the tbecs .    keeping a pace with the studies on tbecs , has been the realization of various condensed matter phenomena like ac josephson effect , bloch oscillations , landau - zener tunneling , etc . in single species",
