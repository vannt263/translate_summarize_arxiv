    "in a foreseeable future , telemetry will reach a new accuracy using laser links and high accuracy clocks ( such as the tipo experiments which is in study @xcite ) . at such experiments accuracies ,",
    "the effective 1,5 pn / rm ( acronym defined in section [ sec : term ] ) metric defined from the 1pn iau2000 @xcite metric will be no longer enough to fit data ( 2 pn / rm effects lead to terms of about @xmath1s for a flying time of about 1000s when tagging units accuracy reach at least @xmath2s ) .",
    "hence , it is necessary to develop the metric up to the 2 pn / rm order .",
    "our work is completely based on general relativity ( gr ) and hence we do nt consider any alternative theory in this paper .",
    "this means that our result would have a practical usefulness in telemetry only if the gr theory is the  true  theory of gravity or if alternative theory deviates from gr only by sufficiently small post - newtonian numerical parameters in the metric .",
    "this is compatible with present available data . + we start our work from the  exponential parametrization  such as in dsx @xcite or in the iau2000 resolutions @xcite .",
    "hence , our notations come from @xcite .",
    "other works on the subject have already be done ( @xcite,@xcite ) but they did nt write their metric in the convenient exponential parametrization and these works have been done in harmonic gauge from the start to the end . this is not our case since we fix the gauge only at the end when we want peculiar solutions in some peculiar gauges . + in section",
    "[ sec : term ] we introduce a new terminology before recalling some well known results from the dsx paper @xcite in section [ sec:1 ] .",
    "then we derive einstein s equations in our metric s parametrization and finally we give formal solutions in any gauge that respect the exponential parametrization  with a particular attention to the harmonic gauge .",
    "the pn approximation is based on the assumption of a weak gravitational field and weak velocities ( ie . of the order @xmath3 or less , @xmath4 being some caracteristic mass of the system ) for both the sources and the ( test ) body .",
    "it formally consists in looking for solutions under the form of an expansion in powers of @xmath5 .",
    "the usually so - called @xmath6pn order terms in the metric , leading to @xmath7 terms in the equation of motion of a body describing a bounded orbit , are terms of orders @xmath8 in @xmath9 , @xmath10 in @xmath11 and @xmath12 in @xmath13 . in this paper ,",
    "a metric developped this way will be refered as the npn / bm metric ( bm meaning `` bounded motion ''  for test particles ) . it is particularly well - adapted for studying bounded motions in systems made by non - relativistic massive bodies , as the solar system is .    however , since we are interested in the propagation of light , we are lead to relax the hypothesis on the velocity of the test particle whose motion is considered .",
    "of course , this does nt change the full metric , but the terms to be considered in the metric components are not the same as in the pn / bm problem .",
    "indeed , the terms leading to @xmath12 terms in the equation of motion of a test particle moving with relativistic velocity are terms of order @xmath12 in @xmath14 ( ie . in both @xmath9 , @xmath11 and @xmath15 ) . in this paper ,",
    "a metric developped this way will be refered as the npn / rm metric ( rm meaning `` relativistic motion ''  for test particles ) .",
    "a pn / rm metric is particularly well - suited for studying _ relativistic _ motions of test bodies ( for instance , the propagation of light ) in systems made by non - relativistic bodies , as the solar system is .",
    "pn / bm and pn / rm orders are illustrated in figure [ fig : pmvspn62 ] .    the present paper deals with the pn / rm problem since we are concerned in propagation of light .",
    "we recall here results from dsx@xcite on the 1,5pn / bm metric .",
    "first , the  exponential parametrization  with the spatial isotropy condition makes the metric writes    @xmath16    with @xmath17 . from which follows @xmath18 the einstein field equation then reduces to four equations on @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "hence , to the 1,5pn / bm approximation correspond 4 equations of the gr equation and the gauge invariance keep 1 degree of freedom ( indeed @xmath25 is approximately divergence free ) .",
    "this gauge invariance is characterized by the arbitrary differentiable function @xmath26 in dsx . @xmath27",
    "the iau2000 resolution then corresponds to a peculiar choice of gauge in order to fix the last degree of freedom : the harmonic gauge .",
    "this condition writes , in the 1,5pn / bm approximation @xmath28 .",
    "the four metric field equations then reduce to @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "at the 2pn / rm order , we get 6 new degrees of freedom in the metric . as we know , from the 10 degrees of freedom in the equation of gr , there are only 6 cleared by the 10 equations since 4 degrees of freedom correspond to a gauge invariance .",
    "indeed , the metric is determined by the field equations modulo the knowing of the used coordinates . since , there are four coordinates , there are 4 degrees of freedom not reduced by the 10 field equations .",
    "as seen in the previous section , to the 1,5pn / bm approximation correspond 4 metric field equations and the gauge invariance , characterized by @xmath26 , keep 1 degrees of freedom .",
    "then , we expect from the 2pn / rm order 6 equations with a gauge invariant field ( characterized by a 3-vector ) which ( the equations ) reduce the 6 degrees of freedom to 3 .",
    "let us fix the covariant form of the metric    @xmath31    @xmath32    which implie    @xmath33    then we can derive the 2pn / rm field equations from the einstein field equation @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath35    where @xmath36 @xmath37",
    "then , considering @xmath19 and @xmath38 as source terms and identifying the relation @xmath39 from ( [ eq:2pnw ] ) , we get    @xmath40.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    where @xmath41 . as expected , the operator @xmath42 is gauge invariant through a relation on any 3-vector field .",
    "indeed , we have @xmath43 , whatever is the 3-vector field @xmath44 .",
    "hence , the 2pn / rm gauge invariance is characterized by both the arbitrary differentiable function @xmath26 and the arbitrary differentiable 3-vector @xmath44 .",

    ", @xmath44 must satisfy @xmath48 which is clearly inversible since we know the laplacian s green function .",

    ".      the harmonic gauge condition stands @xmath54 ( or @xmath55 with @xmath56 the metric determinant ) . as seen in dsx @xcite , the harmonic 1,5pn / bm condition @xmath57 gives the usual harmonic constraint on the  potentials  ( @xmath58 ) . while , the conditions @xmath59 give no more information due to the  isotropy condition  which makes spatial coordinates always harmonic modulo @xmath60 . at the 2pn / rm level ,",
    "the harmonic constraint is @xmath61 . that gives the harmonic conditions on the  potentials  at the 2pn / rm level    @xmath62    then @xmath63 writes :    @xmath64    hence , considering @xmath19 and @xmath20 as source terms , the solution of the einstein field equations in the harmonic gauge is :    @xmath65    where @xmath19 and @xmath66 satisfy the 1,5pn / bm harmonic condition ( [ eq:2pnharmonic ] ) .",
    "+   + _ from non - harmonic to harmonic gauge _ +   + if @xmath67 is not an harmonic solution , then the gauge transformation @xmath68 makes @xmath69 an harmonic solution if @xmath70 satisfies    @xmath71    where @xmath66 must be expressed in the harmonic gauge with the 1,5pn / bm field equations ( [ eq:2pnwi ] ) . since it is inversible , this relation always allow us to put the metric in the harmonic gauge , whatever is the gauge from which we start .",
    "in order to fit future inter - planetary telemetry data , we developed a gr metric up to the 2 pn / rm order with the dsx  exponential parametrization  .",
    "we gave both general and harmonic formal solutions .",
    "a more detailed version of this result can be found in @xcite .",
