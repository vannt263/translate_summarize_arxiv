    "tumors result from an evolutionary process occurring within a tissue ( nowell , 1976 ) . from an evolutionary point of view , tumors can be considered as collections of cells that accumulate genetic and epigenetic alterations .",
    "the phenotypic changes that these alterations confer to cells are subjected to the selection pressures within the tissue and lead to adaptations such as the evolution of more aggressive cell types , the emergence of resistance , induction of angiogenesis , evasion of the immune system , and colonization of distant organs with metastatic growth .",
    "advantageous heritable alterations can cause a rapid expansion of the cell clone harboring such changes , since these cells are capable of outcompeting cells that have not evolved similar adaptations .",
    "the investigation of the dynamics of cell growth , the speed of accumulating mutations , and the distribution of different cell types at various timepoints during tumorigenesis is important for an understanding of the natural history of tumors .",
    "further , such knowledge aids in the prognosis of newly diagnosed tumors , since the presence of cell clones with aggressive phenotypes lead to less optimistic predictions for tumor progression .",
    "finally , a knowledge of the composition of tumors allows for the choice of optimum therapeutic interventions , as tumors harboring pre - existing resistant clones should be treated differently than drug - sensitive cell populations .",
    "mathematical models have led to many important insights into the dynamics of tumor progression and the evolution of resistance ( goldie and coldman , 1983 and 1984 ; bodmer and tomlinson , 1995 ; coldman and murray , 2000 ; knudson , 2001 ; maley and forrest , 2001 ; michor et al .",
    ", 2004 ; iwasa et al . , 2005 ; komarova and wodarz , 2005 ; michor et al . , 2006 ; michor and iwasa , 2006 ; frank 2007 ; wodarz and komarova , 2007 )",
    "these mathematical models generally fall into one of two classes : ( i ) constant population size models , and ( ii ) models describing exponentially growing populations .",
    "many theoretical investigations of exponentially growing populations employ multi - type branching process models ( e.g. , iwasa et al . , 2006 ;",
    "haeno et al . , 2007 ; durrett and moseley , 2009 ) , while others use population genetic models for homogeneously mixing exponentially growing populations ( e.g. , beerenwinkel et al .",
    ", 2007 ; durrett and mayberry , 2009 ) . in this paper",
    ", we focus on branching process models . in these models , cells with @xmath0 mutations",
    "are denoted as type-@xmath1 cells , and @xmath2 specifies the number of type-@xmath1 cells at time @xmath3 .",
    "type-@xmath1 cells die at rate @xmath4 , give birth to one new type-@xmath1 cell at rate @xmath5 , and give birth to one new type-@xmath6 cell at rate @xmath7 . in an alternate version ,",
    "mutations occur with probability @xmath8 during birth events which occur at rate @xmath9 .",
    "these two versions are equivalent provided @xmath10 and @xmath11 . however , the relationship between the parameters must be kept in mind when comparing results between different formulations of the model .",
    "one biologically unrealistic aspect of this model as presented in the literature is that all type-@xmath1 cells are assumed to have the same birth and death rates .",
    "this assumption describes situations during tumorigenesis in which the order of mutations is predetermined , i.e. the genetic changes can only be accumulated in a particular sequence and all other combinations of mutations lead to lethality .",
    "furthermore , in this interpretation of the model , there can not be any variability in phenotype among cells with the same number of mutations .",
    "in many situations arising in biology , however , there is marked heterogeneity in phenotype even if genetically , the cells are identical ( elowitz et al . , 2002 ; becskei et al . , 2005 ; kaern et al . , 2005 ; feinerman et al . ,",
    "2008 ) . this variability may be driven by stochasticity in gene expression or in post - transcriptional or post - translational modifications . in this paper",
    ", we modify the branching process model so that mutations alter cell birth rates by a random amount .",
    "an important consideration for this endeavor is the choice of the mutational fitness distribution .",
    "the exponential distribution has become the preferred candidate in theoretical studies of the genetics of adaptation .",
    "the first theoretical justification of this choice was given by gillespie ( 1983 , 1984 ) , who argued that if the number of possible alleles is large and the current allele is close to the top of the rank ordering in fitness values , then extreme value theory should provide insight into the distribution of the fitness values of mutations . for many distributions including the normal , gamma , and lognormal distributions , the maximum of @xmath12 independent draws , when properly scaled , converges to the gumbel or double exponential distribution , @xmath13 . in the biological literature , it is generally noted that this class of distributions only excludes exotic distributions like the cauchy distribution , which has no moments .",
    "however , in reality , it eliminates all distributions with @xmath14 . for distributions in the domain of attraction of the gumbel distribution , and if @xmath15 are the @xmath16 largest observations in a sample of size @xmath12 , then there is a sequence of constants @xmath17 so that the spacings @xmath18 converge to independent exponentials with mean 1 , see e.g. , weissman ( 1978 ) . following up on gillespie s work , orr ( 2003 ) added the observation that in this setting , the distribution of the fitness increases due to beneficial mutations has the same distribution as @xmath19 independent of the rank @xmath1 of the wild type cell .    to infer the distribution of fitness effects of newly emerged beneficial mutations ,",
    "several experimental studies were performed ; for examples , see imhoff and schlotterer ( 2001 ) , sanjuan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , and kassen and bataillon ( 2006 ) .",
    "the data from these experiments is generally consistent with an exponential distribution of fitness effects .",
    "however , there is an experimental caveat that can not be neglected ( rozen et al . , 2002 ) : if only those mutations are considered that reach 100% frequency in the population , then the exponential distribution is multiplied by the fixation probability . by this operation , a distribution with a mode at a positive value develops . in a study of a quasi - empirical model of rna evolution in which fitness was based on secondary structures , cowperthwaite et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found that fitnesses of randomly selected genotypes appeared to follow a gumbel - type distribution .",
    "they also discovered that the fitness distribution of beneficial mutations appeared exponential only when the vast majority of small - effect mutations were ignored .",
    "furthermore , it was determined that the distribution of beneficial mutations depends on the fitness of the parental genotype ( cowperthwaite et al . , 2005",
    "; maclean and buckling , 2009 ) .",
    "however , since the exceptions to this conclusion arise when the fitness of the wild type cell is low , these findings do not contradict the picture based on extreme value theory .",
    "in contrast to the evidence above , recent work of rokyta et al .",
    "( 2008 ) has shown that in two sets of beneficial mutations arising in the bacteriophage id11 and in the phage @xmath20  for which the mutations were identified by sequencing  beneficial fitness effects are not exponential . using a statistical method developed by biesal et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , they tested the null hypothesis that the fitness distribution has an exponential tail .",
    "they found that the null hypothesis could be rejected in favor of a distribution with a right truncated tail .",
    "their data also violated the common assumption that small - effect mutations greatly outnumber those of large effect , as they were consistent with a uniform distribution of beneficial effects .",
    "a possible explanation for the bounded fitness distribution may be found in the culture conditions utilized in the experiments : they evolved id11 on _ e.coli _ at an elevated temperature ( @xmath21 c instead of @xmath22 c )",
    ". there may be a limited number of mutations that will enable id11 to survive in increased temperatures .",
    "the latter situation may be similar to scenarios arising during tumorigenesis , where , in order to develop resistance to a drug or to progress to a more aggressive stage , the conformation of a particular protein must be changed or a certain regulatory network must be disrupted . if there is a finite , but large , number of possible beneficial mutations , then it is convenient to use a continuous distribution as an approximation .    in this paper , we consider both bounded distributions and unbounded distributions for the fitness advance and derive asymptotic results for the number of type-@xmath16 individuals at time @xmath3 .",
    "we determine the effects of the fitness distribution on the growth kinetics of the population , and investigate the rates of expansion for both bounded and unbounded fitness distributions .",
    "this model provides a framework to investigate the accumulation of mutations with random fitness effects .",
    "the remainder of this section is dedicated to statements and discussion of our main results .",
    "proofs of these results can be found in sections [ prelimsec]-[unbndsec ] .",
    "let us consider a multi - type branching process in which type-@xmath1 cells have accumulated @xmath23 advantageous mutations .",
    "suppose the initial population consists entirely of type-0 cells that give birth at rate @xmath24 to new type-0 cells , die at rate @xmath25 , and give birth to new type-1 cells at rate @xmath26 .",
    "the parameters @xmath24 , @xmath27 , and @xmath26 denote the birth rate , death rate , and mutation rate for type-0 cells . to simplify computations",
    ", we will approximate the number of type-0 cells by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 .",
    "if the initial cell population @xmath30 , then the branching process giving the number of 0 s is almost deterministic and this approximation is accurate .",
    "when a new type-1 cell is born , we choose @xmath31 according to a continuous probability distribution @xmath32 .",
    "the new type 1-cell and its descendants then have birth rate @xmath33 , death rate @xmath27 , and mutation rate @xmath34 .",
    "in general , type-@xmath16 cells with birth rate @xmath35 mutate to type-@xmath36 cell at rate @xmath37 and when a mutation occurs , the new type-@xmath36 cell and its descendants have an increased birth rate @xmath38 where @xmath39 is drawn according to @xmath32 .",

    "[ th1a ] if @xmath45 holds , then @xmath46 where @xmath47 means @xmath48 .",
    "the next result shows that the actual growth rate of type-1 cells is slower than the mean . here , and in what follows , we use @xmath49 to indicate convergence in distribution .",
    "[ th1b ] if @xmath45 holds and @xmath50 , then for @xmath51 , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is an explicit constant whose value will be given in .",
    "in particular , we have @xmath54 where @xmath55 has laplace transform given by the righthand side of .",
    "theorem [ th1b ] is similar to theorem 3 in durrett and moseley ( 2009 ) which assumes a deterministic fitness distribution so that all type-1 cells have growth rate @xmath56 .",
    "there , the asymptotic growth rate of the first generation is @xmath57 .",
    "in contrast , the continuous fitness distribution we consider here has the effect of slowing down the growth rate of the first generation by the polynomial factor @xmath58 . to explain this difference",
    ", we note that the calculation of the mean given in section [ bndz1sec ] shows that the dominant contribution to @xmath59 comes from growth rates @xmath60 .",
    "however , mutations with this growth rate are unlikely until the number of type-0 cells is @xmath61 , i.e. , roughly at time @xmath62 .",
    "thus at time @xmath3 , the number of type-1 cells will be roughly @xmath63 .    to prove theorem [ th1b ]",
    ", we look at mutations as a point process in @xmath64 \\times [ 0,b]$ ] : there is a point at @xmath65 if there was a mutant with birth rate @xmath66 at time @xmath67 .",
    "this allows us to derive the following explicit expression for the laplace transform of @xmath59 : e ( e^-z_1(t ) ) = ( - u_1 _ 0^b dx g(x ) _ 0^t ds v_0 e^_0 s ( 1 - _ x , t - s ( ) ) ) where @xmath68 and @xmath69 is a continuous - time branching process with birth rate @xmath66 , death rate @xmath27 , and initial population @xmath70 . in figure",
    "[ fig : wave1 ] , we compare the exact laplace transform of @xmath71 with the results of simulations and the limiting laplace transform from theorem [ th1b ] , illustrating the convergence as @xmath72 .",
    "notice that the laplace transform of @xmath55 has the form @xmath73 where @xmath74 which implies that @xmath75 as @xmath76 ( see , for example , the argument in section 3 of durrett and moseley ( 2009 ) ) . to gain some insight into how this limit comes about , we give a second proof of the convergence that tells us the limit is the sum of points in a nonhomogeneous poisson process .",
    "each point in the limiting process represents the contribution of a different mutant lineage to @xmath59 .",
    "[ th1c ] @xmath77 is the sum of the points of a poisson process on @xmath78 with mean measure @xmath79 .",
    "a similar result can be obtained for deterministic fitness distributions , see the corollary to theorem 3 in durrett and moseley ( 2009 ) .",
    "however , the new result shows that the point process limit is not an artifact of assuming that all first generation mutants have the same growth rate .",
    "even when the fitness advances are random , different mutant lines contribute to the limit .",
    "this result is consistent with observations of maley et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and shah et al .",
    "( 2009 ) that tumors contain cells with different mutational haplotypes .",
    "theorem [ th1c ] also gives quantitative predictions about the relative contribution of different mutations to the total population .",
    "these implications will be explored further in a follow - up paper currently in progress .    with the behavior of the first generation analyzed",
    ", we are ready to proceed to the study of further generations .",
    "the computation of the mean is straightforward .",
    "[ th2a ] if @xmath45 holds , then @xmath80    as in the @xmath81 case , the mean involves a polynomial correction to the exponential growth and again , does not give the correct growth rate for the number of type-@xmath16 cells .",

    "@xmath92 is the same as a process in which the initial type ( here type-1 cells ) behaves like @xmath93 instead of @xmath94 , so the result can be proved by induction .    to explain the form of the result we consider the case @xmath95",
    "breaking things down according to the times and the sizes of the mutational changes , we have @xmath96 as in the result for @xmath59 the dominant contribution comes from @xmath97 and as in the discussion preceding the statement of theorem [ th1b ] , the time of the first mutation to @xmath98 is @xmath99 .",

    ", we compare the asymptotic laplace transform from theorem [ th2b ] with the results of simulations in the case @xmath95 .",
    "to explain the slow convergence to the limit , we note that if we take account of the mutation rates @xmath106 in the heuristic from the previous paragraph ( which becomes important when @xmath107 are small ) , then the first time we see a type-1 cell with growth rate @xmath98 will not occur until time @xmath108 when the type-0 cells reach @xmath109 and so the first type-2 cell with growth rate @xmath110 will not be born until time @xmath111 when the descendants of the type-1 cells with growth rate @xmath112 reach size @xmath113 . when @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 , @xmath117 .",
    "the mutations created at this point will need some time to grow and become dominant in the population .",

    "second , this choice allows us to consider the gamma(@xmath124 ) distribution which has @xmath125 and the normal distribution , which asymptotically has this form with @xmath126 .",
    "to analyze this situation , we will again take a poisson process viewpoint and look at the contribution from a mutation at time @xmath67 with increased growth rate @xmath127 . a mutation that increases the growth rate by @xmath127 at time @xmath67",

    "the intuition behind this is that since the type-0 cells have growth rate @xmath153 and the distribution of the increase in fitness has tail @xmath154 , the largest advance @xmath127 attained by time @xmath3 should occur when @xmath155 and satisfy @xmath156 the growth rate of its family is then @xmath157 .",
