    "the origin of quantization and nature of the planck constant remain the most intriguing problems of physics , from the very moment of the creation of the quantum theory ( qt ) at the beginning of the last century . from the beginning",
    "a great number of attempts to explain the nature of the planck constant were made .",
    "one interesting way to do this was that suggested by boyer in 1978 @xcite ( see also ( * ? ? ? * -4 ) and references therein ) , within the framework of zero - point radiation .",
    "another idea that should be mentioned here was recently implemented in the framework of the electrodynamics model of the atom proposed by m. percovac @xcite . within this approach ( as it was shown by author )",
    "the planck constant value could probably depends on the energy ( see also experimental papers cited below in which such a dependence was discussed ) .    in our papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite",
    "we suggest a more natural manner to explain the origin of the planck constant due to the geometrical quantization of action .",
    "this way not only allows us to calculate the correct value of the planck constant from the first principles ( i.e. from cosmological parameters , or from the geometry of our universe ) , but it also allows us to unify the qt and the relativistic physics . moreover , from the observational fact that geometry of our universe is changed adiabatically on time , it immediately follows that the planck constant should change its value with time .",
    "it is important also to mention here the work of v. garcia morales @xcite in whish , starting from the thermodynamics , he argued that neither time nor space needs to be discrete but it is just action what is quantized .",
    "all this facts suggest the importance of accurate measurement of planck s constant in all energy ranges for the possible detection of more subtle effects and , as a consequence , for experimental justification of the theory .",
    "recently there appears a compilation of experimental measurements of the planck s constant for wide range of energies @xcite , where the probable experimentally measurable dependence of the planck constant on energy was supposed .",
    "so , more careful experiments over all energy ranges are clearly needed .",
    "at the moment there are a lot of measurements of the planck constant at small energies from @xmath0 to @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "also the measurements for @xmath2 are available @xcite , but in the range of energies from @xmath1 to @xmath2 there are no precise data reported @xcite . in this case",
    "it is of great importance not only elaborate new experimental technique , but also increase precision of actually available methods .",
    "one such method of direct measurement of the planck constant should be mentioned here is the technique based on the duane - hunt ( d - h ) relation .",
    "this relation was written from classical point of view , without relativistic corrections .",
    "for this reason it shows dramatic discrepancy for the measured planck constant in respect to the codata value @xcite which appears in second - third digit .",
    "for this reason the d - h relation in its classical form can not be used for precise measurements of the planck constant @xcite .    in present paper",
    "we have revised d - h relation by considering relativistic corrections .",
    "an exact relativistic relation between the incident electron energy and energy of produced x - ray photon is obtained , and 4 terms of its expansion are suggested .",
    "this relation is precise if compared with the duane  hunt expression , which actually corresponds to the first term of the expansion on parameter v / c .",
    "let s consider in details the geometry and physics of the process of scattering of a relativistic electron on a tungsten atom with the emission of a photon . in the minkowski spacetime",
    "we represent it in fig.1 .",
    "@xmath3    @xmath4 .",
    "schematic representation of the momentum four - vectors of each of the entities involved , where the subscript @xmath5 represents the electron and the subscript @xmath6 corresponds to tungsten , the prima superscript indicates the quantities after collision , and @xmath7 is the momentum of the emitted photon .    in this case",
    "the conservation equations for temporal and spatial parts of the @xmath8-momentum @xcite are    @xmath9    @xmath10    were the subscript @xmath11 denotes the emitted photon .",
    "we can rewrite @xmath12 in the corresponding projections as follows :    @xmath13    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the reduced planck s constant , @xmath16 is the wavenumber of the emitted photon , and @xmath17 , @xmath18 are the @xmath19- moments of each constituent of the system before @xmath20 and after @xmath21 interaction .    in consequence with experimental evidence and d - h relation , we also assume that the initial electron transfers all of its energy and momentum to the photon ( this is the case in the framework of a duane  hunt relation ) . i.e. @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "thus @xmath24 and @xmath25 take the form    @xmath26    @xmath27    by squaring @xmath28 , we get    @xmath29    and rewrite @xmath30 to have    @xmath31    from @xmath32 through a trigonometric identity , we obtain    @xmath33    and from @xmath34 and @xmath35 , we have    @xmath36    besides that , the relativistic equations for energy also should be applied",
    ". they are @xmath37 and @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the total energy , @xmath40 kinetic energy , and @xmath17 is the @xmath19-momentum . from this relation and @xmath41",
    "we have the following expression for energy :    @xmath42    where by assumption @xmath43 ( it implies that @xmath44 )",
    ". therefore    @xmath45    when the electron reaches the anode , it has a total energy @xmath46 , whereas @xmath47 , @xmath48 are nonrelativistic , namely they can be substituted by classical expression @xmath49 , then    @xmath50    hence , the square of momentum of the tungsten nucleus after the interaction is    @xmath51    the momentum of the electron @xmath52 in terms of its total energy is    @xmath53    substituting @xmath54 and @xmath55 into @xmath56 and solving it for @xmath57 , one can obtain the following expression ,    @xmath58   \\tag{16}\\ ] ]    this expression was obtained in the approximation of the smallness of the relativistic corrections to the classical energy of the tungsten atom .",
    "let s evaluate how accurate this expression is . for the electron , we used exact relativistic expressions for energy and momentum , while for tungsten we limited ourselves to the second term of the expansion ( the kinetic energy of the atom ) .",
    "the expansion for the energy of the tungsten atom up to the third term is : @xmath59 . for thermal velocities",
    "@xmath60 that correspond to a temperature of 2000 k , we obtain the estimate for this correction : @xmath61 . as one can see , this is quite sufficient for accurate measurements of the planck constant .    finally , to compare our result with the original d - h relation @xmath62  , we should expand this expression in respect to the small parameter @xmath63 . by leaving the first order terms in the expansion",
    ", we immediately obtain    @xmath64    so , as one can see the first term coincides exactly with the d - h relation , while the subsequent three terms are first - order relativistic corrections to the relation .",
    "in present paper the improved expression for the d - h relation is obtained .",
    "this expression takes into account the fact that velocities of atoms are differ from zero and relativistic corrections for the electron energy - momentum are significant .",
    "we suggest exact formula ( 16 ) , which generalizes the d - h relation by taking into account relativistic effects .",
    "we also suggest expansion of the relation obtained , in order to compare our result with the original d - h relation .",
    "as one can see , the first term of this expansion coincide precisely with the duane - hunt law @xmath65 , and the next terms correspond to the relativistic corrections .",
    "obtained expression allows us to determine the planck s constant ( with appropriate experimental data ) with greater precision and in great range of energies ( from 1ev to 1mev ) which was unavailable for other experiments .",
    "for this reason one can hope that obtained expression will be useful to close this great gup in experimental measurements of the planck constant .    to conclude it",
    "should be mentioned again that there exist a large number of physical theories , particularly based on the geometric approach @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , which not only allow us to calculate the planck constant from the first principles , but also predict its variation .",
    "thus , the problem of accurate experimental determination of planck constant is of crucial importance , since such measurements will make it possible to discriminate a large number of theories by choosing those that correspond to the experiment .",
