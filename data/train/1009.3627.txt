    "the understanding of the effective functionality that governs the enzymatic self - organized processes in cellular conditions is a crucial topic in the post - genomic era .",
    "a number of measures have been proposed for the functionality and correlations between biochemical time series .",
    "however , functional correlations do not imply effective connectivity and most synchronization measures do not distinguish between causal and non - causal interactions .",
    "in recent studies , transfer entropy ( te ) has been proposed as a rigorous , robust and self - consistent method for the causal quantification of the functional information flow among nonlinear processes . here , we have used te to establish the effective functional connectivity of yeast glycolysis under dissipative conditions .",
    "concretely , we have applied this method for a quantification of how much the temporal evolution of the activity of one enzyme helps to improve the future prediction of another . in the enzymatic activities ,",
    "the oscillatory patterns of the metabolic products might have causal information which can be appropriately read - out by the te .",
    "we have performed numerical studies of yeast glycolysis under dissipative conditions and found the emergence of a new kind of dynamical functional structure , characterized by changing connectivity flows and a metabolic invariant that constrains the activity of the irreversible enzymes .",
    "yeast glycolysis is one of the most studied dissipative pathways of the cell ; it was the first metabolic system in which spontaneous oscillations were observed @xcite , and the study of these rhythms allowed the construction of the first dynamic model where the kinetics of an enzyme was explicitly considered @xcite .",
    "more concretely , the main instability - generating mechanism in the yeast glycolysis is based on the self - catalytic regulation of the enzyme phosphofructokinase @xcite .",
    "glycolysis is the central pathway of glucose degradation which is implied in relevant metabolic processes , such as the maintenance of cellular redox states , the provision of atp for membrane pumps and protein phosphorylation , biosynthesis , etc ; and its activity is linked to a high variety of important cellular processes , e.g. , glycolysis has a long history in cancer cell biology @xcite and cell proliferation @xcite , there is a correlation between brain aerobic glycolysis and amyloid-@xmath2 plaque deposition which might precede the clinical manifestations of the alzheimer disease @xcite , the glycolytic inhibition abrogates epileptogenesis @xcite , and glycolysis is also related with oxidative stress @xcite and apoptosis @xcite .    over the last 30 years a large number of different studies focused on different molecular mechanisms allowing for the emergency of self - organized glycolytic patterns @xcite . nevertheless , despite the intense advance of the knowledge of these metabolic structure , we still lack a quantitative description in cellular conditions of the effective functional structure and the causal effects among the enzymes .    in this paper , to go a next step further in the understanding of the relationship between the classical topological structure and functionality we have analyzed the effective connectivity of yeast glycolysis , which in inter - enzyme interactions accounts for the influence that the activity of one enzyme has on the future of another @xcite .    for this purpose",
    ", we considered a yeast glycolytic model described by a system of three delay - differential equations in which there is an explicit consideration of the speed functions of the three irreversible enzymes hexokinase , phosphofructokinase and pyruvatekinase .",
    "these enzymatic activity functions were previously modeled and tested experimentally by other different groups @xcite .",
    "we have obtained time series of enzymatic activity under different sources of the glucose input flux .",
    "the data corresponded to a typical quasi - periodic route to chaos which is in agreement with experimental conditions @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the glycolytic system changes substantially trough this route , which allows for a better comparison of the enzymatic processes in periodic , quasi - periodic and chaotic conditions .    using the non - linear analysis techniques such as transfer entropy @xcite and mutual information @xcite ,",
    "we have analyzed the glycolytic series and quantified the effective connectivity of the enzymes .",
    "the results show that in the numerical analysis of yeast glycolysis , under dissipative conditions , a effective functional structure emerges which is characterized by changing connectivity flows and a metabolic invariant that constraints the activity of the irreversible enzymes .",
    "the monitoring of the fluorescence of nadh in glycolyzing baker@xmath3s yeast under sinusoidal glucose input flux , have shown that quasi - periodic time patterns are common at low amplitudes of the input and for high amplitudes chaotic behaviours emerge @xcite .    in order to simulate these metabolic processes ,",
    "the system is considered under periodic input flux with a sinusoidal source of glucose @xmath4 . assuming the experimental value of @xmath5mm / h @xcite , after dividing by @xmath6 ( the michaelis constant of phosphofructokinase ,",
    "see for more details materials and methods ) we have obtained the normalized input flux @xmath7 hz .    under these conditions ,",
    "a wide range of different types of dynamic patterns can emerge as a function of the control parameter , hereafter the amplitude a of the sinusoidal glucose input flux @xcite .",
    "in particular , it is observed a quasi - periodic route to chaos ( cf .",
    "left panel in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) ; thus for a@xmath8 the biochemical oscillator exhibits a periodic pattern ( figure 2a ) .",
    "an increment of the amplitude to a@xmath9 provokes a hopf bifurcation generating another fundamental frequency , as a consequence , quasi - periodic behaviors emerge ( figure 2b ) . above a@xmath10 ,",
    "complex quasi - periodic oscillations appear ( figure 2c ) . after a new hopf bifurcation",
    "the originated dynamical behavior is not particularly stable and small perturbations produce deterministic chaos ( a@xmath11 , figure 2d ) , as predicted by ruelle and takens @xcite .",
    "this route is in agreement with experimental conditions @xcite .    to go a next step further in the understanding of the relationship between the classical topological structure and effective functionality we have analyzed by means of non - linear statistical tools the catalytic patterns belonging to this scenario to chaos , and for each transition represented in the figure 2",
    "we have obtained three time series corresponding to the variables @xmath12 , @xmath2 and @xmath13 ( 12 in total ) , which denote respectively the normalized concentrations of glucose-6-phosphate , fructose 1 - 6-bisphosphate and pyruvate .",
    "transfer entropy ( te ) quantifies the reduction in uncertainty that one variable has on its own future when adding another .",
    "this measure allows for a calculation of the functional influence in terms of effective connectivity between two variables @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the glycolytic data by means of the te method are shown in table i. the 4d vectors in square brackets correspond to the results obtained for the 4 different amplitudes of the considered glucose input flux , a=[0.001;0.005;0.021;0.023 ] .",
    "the values of functional influence are ranging in @xmath14 , with mean@xmath15 and standard deviation=@xmath16 , what indicates in general terms a high effective connectivity in the enzymatic system .",
    "the minimum value 0.58 corresponded to the causality flow between e@xmath17 and e@xmath18 when a simple periodic behavior emerges .",
    "however , the functional connectivity from e2 to e3 shows the maximum value , achieved in all considered conditions of the glucose input flux .",
    "the glycolytic effective connectivity is illustrated in the right panel of fig .",
    "the arrows width is proportional to the te between pairs of enzymes .",
    "the values change trough the quasi - periodic route to chaos , remarked from e3 to e2 by black dashed circles , [ 0.58;0.84;0.61;0.66 ] .    in all cases analyzed , the values of te present a maximum statistical significance ( pvalue=0 ) .",
    "next , we have measured the total information flow , defined as the total outward of transfer entropy arriving to one enzyme minus the total inward .",
    "positive values mean that that enzyme is a source of causality flow and negative flows are interpreted as sinks or targets .",
    "the results of the total information flows are shown in table ii ( pvalue=0 ) .",
    "the maximum source of total transfer information ( 0.41 ) corresponds to the e2 enzyme ( phosphofructokinase ) for a=0.021 , when complex quasi - periodic oscillations appear in the glycolytic system .",
    "for all conditions the enzyme e@xmath18 ( phosphofructokinase ) is the main source of effective influence and the enzyme e@xmath17 ( pyruvatekinase ) a sink , which could be interpreted as a target from a point of view based on its effective functionality .",
    "the enzyme e@xmath19 ( hexokinase ) is less constrained , and it has a flow close to zero for all conditions .    the attributed role to each enzyme , namely e@xmath18 the source , e@xmath17 the sink and e@xmath19 no - constrained is an invariant and preserved trough the whole route to chaos .",
    "time correlations allows for quantification about how much two time series are statistically independent .",
    "according to that , we have measured the time pairwise correlations in the enzymatic system , and the corresponding results are shown in table iii .",
    "the main finding is that e@xmath18 and e@xmath17 are highly synchronized ( correlation=0.90 , pvalue=0 ) and e@xmath19 is anti - synchronized with both e@xmath18 and e@xmath17 ( respectively , correlation equals -0.65 and -0.66 , pvalue=0 ) .",
    "these values of time correlations were almost constant trough the quasi - periodic route to chaos and established that the activities of e@xmath18 and e@xmath17 are grouped to the same function , being activated at similar time and oppositely to e@xmath19 .      the mutual information ( mi ) quantifies how much the knowledge of one variable reduces the entropy or uncertainty of the another @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the glycolytic data by means of this method are shown in table iv .",
    "the high values of mi ( close to 0.50 ) proved a high informative redundancy between the pairs of enzymes .",
    "so , the number of bits of information transferred from one enzyme to another is much larger than the actually needed .",
    "the values in the principal diagonal of table iv represent the uncertainty for each variable .",
    "we have found these values gradually descending , h(e@xmath19)=[1.00;1.00;1.00;1.00 ] , h(e@xmath18)=[0.85;0.84;0.85;0.86 ] and h(e@xmath18)= [ 0.76;0.74;0.76;0.78 ] , which is indicative of the uncertainty in the enzymatic activity patterns belonging to e@xmath19 , e@xmath18 and e@xmath17 is reduced monotonously for all analyzed conditions .",
    "the values of mi have a maximum statistical significance ( pvalue=0 ) .",
    "finally , we have computed the mutual information between the glucose input fluxes and the activity patterns of the different enzymes . in all cases ,",
    "the mi was equal to zero , proving that the oscillations of the glucose were statistical independent of the glucose- 6-phosphate , fructose 1 - 6-biphosphate and pyruvate , products of the main irreversible enzymes of glycolysis .",
    "in this paper we have quantified essential aspects of the effective functional connectivity among the main glycolytic enzymes in dissipative conditions .",
    "first , we have computed under different source of glucose the causality flows in the metabolic system .",
    "this level of the functional influence accounts for the contribution of each enzyme to the generation of the different catalytic behavior and adds a directionality in the influence interactions between enzymes .",
    "the results show that the flows of functional connectivity change significantly during the different metabolic transitions analyzed , exhibiting high values of transfer entropy , and in all considered cases , the enzyme phosphofructokinase ( e@xmath18 ) is the main source of effective causality flow ; the pyruvatekinase ( e@xmath17 ) is the main sink of information flow ; the hexokinase ( e@xmath19 ) has a quasi - zero flow , meaning that , the total information arriving to e@xmath19 goes out to either e@xmath18 or e@xmath17 .",
    "the maximum source of total transfer information ( 0.41 ) corresponds to the e@xmath18 enzyme ( phosphofructokinase ) at the edge of chaos , when complex quasi - periodic oscillations emerge ( cf . fig .",
    "2 ) . this finding seems to be consistent with other studies which show that when a dynamical system operates in the frontier between order ( periodic behavior ) and chaos its complexity is maximal @xcite .",
    "the level of influence in terms of causal interactions between the enzymes is not always the same but varies depending on the substrate fluxes and the dynamic characteristics emerging in the system .",
    "in addition to the glycolitic topological structure characterized by the specific location of enzymes , substrates , products and regulatory metabolites there is an functional structure of information flows which is dynamic and exhibit notable variations of the causal interactions .",
    "another aspect of the glycolitic functionality was observed during the quantification of the mutual information , which measures how much the uncertainty about the one enzyme is reduced by knowing the other ; we found that the uncertainty for e@xmath19 , e@xmath18 and e@xmath17 monotonously decreased for all the values of the periodic glucose input - flux .",
    "second , the numerical results show that for all analyzed cases the maximum effective connectivity corresponds to the transfer entropy from e@xmath18 to e@xmath17 , indicating the biggest information flow in the multi - enzyme instability - generating system .",
    "this is also corroborated by the measure of correlation between the different pairs of series which shows that e@xmath18 and e@xmath17 are highly correlated , or synchronized ( correlation=0.90 pvalue=0 ) and e@xmath19 is anti - correlated with both e@xmath18 and e@xmath17 ( respectively , correlation=-0.65",
    "pvalue=0 and correlation=-0.66 pvalue=0 ) . the values of time correlations establish that the activities of e@xmath18 and e@xmath17 are grouped to the same function , being activated at similar time and oppositely to e@xmath19 .",
    "third , our analysis allows for a hierarchical classification in terms of what glycolytic enzyme is improving the future prediction of what others , and the results reveals in a quantitative manner that the enzyme e@xmath18 ( phosphofructokinase ) is the major source of causal information and represents the key - core of glycolysis .",
    "the second in importance is the e@xmath17 ( pyruvatekinase )",
    ".    from the biochemical point of view the e@xmath18 ( phosphofructokinase ) has been commonly considered as a major checkpoint in the control of glycolysis @xcite .",
    "the main reason for this generalized belief is that this enzyme exhibits a complex regulatory behavior that reflects its capacity to integrate many different signals @xcite ; from a dissipative point of view , this enzyme catalyzes a reaction very far from equilibrium and its self - catalytic regulation it has been considered the main instability - generating mechanism for the emergence of oscillatory patters in glycolysis @xcite .",
    "the functional studies presented here confirm in a quantitative manner that the e@xmath18 ( phosphofructokinase ) is the key - core of the pathway , and our results make stronger and expand the classical biochemical studies of glycolysis .    forth , the dynamics of the glycolytic system changes substantially trough the quasi - periodic route to chaos when the amplitude of the input - flux varies .",
    "however , the hierarchy obtained by transfer entropy , e@xmath18 the flow , e@xmath17 the sink and e@xmath19 a quasi - zero flow , is preserved during this route and seems to be an invariant .",
    "this functional invariant of a metabolic process may be important for the understanding of functional enzymatic constraints in cellular conditions ; but this issue requires other additional studies .    finally , we want to emphasize that transfer entropy as a quantitative measure of effective causal connectivity can be a very useful tool in studies of enzymatic processes that operate far from equilibrium conditions .",
    "moreover , many experimental observations have shown that the oscillations in the enzymatic activity seem to represent one of the most striking manifestations of the metabolic dynamic behaviors , of not only qualitative but also quantitative importance in cells ( further details in appendix iii ) .",
    "transfer entropy is able to detect the directed exchange of causality flows among the irreversible enzymes which might allow for a rigorous quantification of the effective functional connectivity of many dissipative metabolic processes in both normal and pathological cellular conditions .",
    "the te method applied to our numerical studies of yeast glycolisis shows the emergence of a new kind of dynamical functional structure which is characterized by changing connectivity flows and a metabolic invariant that constrains the activity of the irreversible enzymes .    the understanding the effective connectivity of the metabolic dissipative structures is crucial to address the functional dynamics of cellular life .",
    "in fig . [ fig1 ] are represented the main enzymatic processes of yeast glycolysis ( the irreversible stages ) with the enzymes arranged in series .",
    "when the metabolite s ( glucose ) feeds the system , it is transformed by the first enzyme e@xmath19 ( hexokinase ) into the product p@xmath19 ( glucose-6-phosphate ) .",
    "the enzymes e@xmath18 ( phosphofructokinase ) and e@xmath17 ( pyruvatekinase ) are allosteric , and transform the substrates p@xmath20 ( fructose 6-phosphate ) and p@xmath21 ( phosphoenolpyruvate ) in the products p@xmath18 ( fructose 1 - 6-bisphosphate ) and p@xmath17 ( pyruvate ) , respectively . the step p@xmath22",
    "@xmath23 p@xmath24 represents reversible activity processes , reflected in the dynamic system by the functional variable @xmath25 .",
    "a part of p@xmath19 does not continue in the metabolic system , and is removed with a rate constant of q@xmath19 which is related with the activity of pentose phosphate pathway ; likewise , q@xmath18 is the rate constant for the sink of the product p@xmath17 which is related with the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex .",
    "the main instability - generating mechanism in yeast glycolysis is the self - catalytic regulation of the enzyme e@xmath18 ( phosphofructokinase ) , specifically , the positive feed - back exerted by the reaction products , the adp and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate @xcite . from a strictly biochemical point of view , e@xmath18 is also considered the main regulator enzyme of glycolysis @xcite .",
    "the second irreversible stage for its regulatory importance is catalyzed by the enzyme e@xmath17 ( pyruvatekinase ) which is inhibited by the atp reaction product @xcite .",
    "finally , the third irreversible process corresponds to the first stage the enzyme e@xmath19 ( hexokinase ) which is dependent on the atp .    in the determination of the enzymatic kinetics of the enzyme e@xmath19 ( hexokinase ) the equation of the reaction speed dependent on glucose and atp",
    "has been used @xcite .",
    "the speed function of the allosteric enzyme e@xmath18 ( phosphofructokinase ) was developed in the framework of the concerted transition theory @xcite .",
    "the reaction speed of the enzyme e@xmath17 ( pyruvatekinase ) , dependent on atp and phospoenolpyruvate , was also constructed on the allosteric model of the concerted transition @xcite .    to study the kinetics of the dissipative glycolytic system we have considered normalized concentrations ; @xmath12 , @xmath2 and @xmath13 denoted respectively the normalized concentrations of p@xmath19 , p@xmath18 and p@xmath17 .",
    "for a spatially homogeneous system the time - evolution is described by the following three delay differential equations : @xmath26 where the functional variables @xmath25 and @xmath27 reflect the normalized concentrations of p@xmath21 ( phosphoenolpyruvate ) and atp respectively .",
    "the three main enzymatic functions are the following : @xmath28 and @xmath29 the constants @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 correspond to the maximum activity of e@xmath19 , e@xmath18 and e@xmath17 ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) divided by the michaelis constants of each enzyme , respectively @xmath36 , @xmath6 and @xmath37 . the constants z s are defined as @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , with @xmath41 representing the dissociation constant of p@xmath18 by e@xmath17 .",
    "the constants d s are @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , with @xmath45 representing the dissociation constant of atp ; @xmath46 and @xmath47 are respectively the allosteric constant of e@xmath18 and e@xmath17 ; c is the non - exclusive binding coefficient of the substrate p@xmath19 .",
    "more details about parameter values and experimental references are given in appendix i.    from the dissipative point of view the essential enzymatic stages are those that correspond to the biochemical irreversible processes @xcite and to simplify the model , we did not consider the intermediate part of glycolysis belonging to the enzymatic reversible stages . in this way",
    ", the functions f and h are supposed to be the identity function .",
    "thus , @xmath48    the initial functions present a simple harmonic oscillation in the following form : @xmath49 with @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the dependent variables @xmath12 , @xmath2 and @xmath13 were normalized dividing them by @xmath6 , @xmath37 and @xmath41 , and the parameters @xmath57 and @xmath58 are time delays affecting the independent variable ( see for more details the appendix ii ) .",
    "the numerical integration of the system was performed with the package ode workbench , which created by dr .",
    "aguirregabiria is part of the physics academic software .",
    "internally this package uses a dormand - prince method of order 5 to integrate differential equations .",
    "further information at http://www.webassign.net/pas/ode/odewb.html .",
    "this model has been exhaustively analyzed before , revealing a notable richness of emergent temporal structures which included the three main routes to chaos , as well as a multiplicity of stable coexisting states , see for more details @xcite .",
    "te allows for a quantification of how much the temporal evolution of the activity of one enzyme helps to improve the future prediction of another .",
    "the oscillatory patterns of the biochemical metabolites might have information which can be read - out by the te .    for a convenient derivation ,",
    "let generally assume that each of the pairs of enzymatic activity is represented by the two time series @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "here , @xmath61 is the state value of the variable @xmath62 in time @xmath63 , and similarly for @xmath64 .",
    "let @xmath65 be the amount of information required to predict the future of @xmath62 ( @xmath66 ) known both the pasts of @xmath62 and @xmath67 ( @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) .",
    "analogously , let @xmath70 be the amount of information required to predict the future of @xmath62 known only its past .",
    "the difference @xmath71 is by definition the transfer entropy from @xmath67 to @xmath62 , denoted by @xmath72 .",
    "it quantifies the amount of information in digits that @xmath67 adds to the predictability of @xmath62 .    rewriting the conditional probabilities as the joint probability divided by its marginal",
    ", one obtains an explicit form for the transfer entropy : @xmath73    the formula ( [ te ] ) is fully equivalent to the mutual information between @xmath66 and @xmath69 conditioned to @xmath68 .",
    "thus , @xmath74 , and consequently , transfer entropy says about how much information the inclusion of @xmath69 adds to the prediction of @xmath66 only considering @xmath68 , ie . @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , te is fully quantifying the information flows between pairs of variables .",
    "the values of te were normalized between 0 and 1 .",
    "it is important to remark that the te from @xmath62 to @xmath67 is different to the one from @xmath67 to @xmath62 , ie .",
    "the effective connectivity is asymmetric , adding a directionality in time which accounts for a particular case of _ directed graphs _ , the graph of information flows between pairs of enzymes .",
    "alternatively to the transfer entropy , effective connectivity can be obtained using granger causality @xcite , which makes emphasis on how much from the past of one variable the predictability of its future is improved by adding the past of another variable .",
    "recently , it has been proved that in the case of gaussian variables both transfer entropy and granger causality are measuring exactly the same @xcite .",
    "therefore , the information flows based on transfer entropy and the granger causality interactions coincide for gaussian variables .",
    "mi quantifies how much the knowledge of one variable reduces the entropy or uncertainty of another",
    ". therefore , mi says about how much information the two variables are sharing .",
    "the strongest point of the mi is that it extends functionality to high order statistics @xcite .",
    "its definition is @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the conditional entropy of @xmath62 given @xmath67 .",
    "it accounts for the remaining uncertainty in @xmath62 knowing the variable @xmath67 .",
    "we referred @xmath78 and @xmath79 as respectively the joint and marginal ( shanon ) entropies .    for statistical independent @xmath62 and @xmath67 variables",
    "one has @xmath80 .",
    "the other limit satisfies @xmath81 , because of @xmath82 . therefore , the mi of two variables is bounded and satisfies that @xmath83 . high values of mi mean that the redundancy in information between the two variables is large .",
    "the values of mi were normalized between 0 and 1 .",
    "for all the probabilities used in both transfer entropy ( te ) and mutual information ( mi ) we used a number of bins of 10 .",
    "as it is well - known , the calculation of these probabilities is sensitive to the number of bins . instead of tuning it as a control parameter to compute the probabilities",
    ", we preferred explored the statistical significance of the computed values .",
    "this was achieved by comparing both the te and mi between the two series of enzymatic activity , say x and y , with the values obtained when considering a random permutation of y , what we called , the shuffled y. the values of both te and mi shown in tables i and iii were larger than those calculated in the shuffled situation ( for both te and mi , pvalue=0 , for 50 different samples ) .",

    "<S> yeast glycolysis is considered the prototype of dissipative biochemical oscillators . in cellular conditions , under sinusoidal source of glucose , the activity of glycolytic enzymes can display either periodic , quasiperiodic or chaotic behavior . in order to quantify the functional connectivity for the glycolytic enzymes in dissipative conditions we have analyzed different catalytic patterns using the non - linear statistical tool of transfer entropy . </S>",
    "<S> the data were obtained by means of a yeast glycolytic model formed by three delay differential equations where the enzymatic speed functions of the irreversible stages have been explicitly considered . </S>",
    "<S> these enzymatic activity functions were previously modeled and tested experimentally by other different groups . in agreement with experimental conditions , </S>",
    "<S> the studied time series corresponded to a quasi - periodic route to chaos . </S>",
    "<S> the results of the analysis are three - fold : first , in addition to the classical topological structure characterized by the specific location of enzymes , substrates , products and feedback regulatory metabolites , an effective functional structure emerges in the modeled glycolytic system , which is dynamical and characterized by notable variations of the functional interactions . </S>",
    "<S> second , the dynamical structure exhibits a metabolic invariant which constrains the functional attributes of the enzymes . </S>",
    "<S> finally , in accordance with the classical biochemical studies , our numerical analysis reveals in a quantitative manner that the enzyme phosphofructokinase is the key - core of the metabolic system , behaving for all conditions as the main source of the effective causal flows in yeast glycolysis .    * quantitative analysis of the effective functional structure in yeast glycolysis *   + jesus m. cortes@xmath0 and ildefonso m. de la fuente@xmath1 + * 1 decsai : departamento de ciencias de la computacion e inteligencia artificial . </S>",
