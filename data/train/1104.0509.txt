    "the argument for strong damping of the anomalous cross section for @xmath239  30  tev was convincingly demonstrated in  @xcite , in the case that the classical field providing the saddle point interpolation between initial and final scattering states is dominated by spherically symmetric configurations .",
    "this @xmath240 symmetry allows the non - vacuum boundary conditions to be fully included in extremizing the effective action . in",
    "@xcite it was shown that a _ sufficient _ condition for the @xmath240 dominance is that the interpolating field takes the form of a chain of `` lumps '' which are well - separated , so that the each lump lies well into the exponentially damped region of its nearest neighbors . however , we are not aware of any reason that such lumped interpolating fields should dominate the effective action .",
    "it is thus of interest to explore the other extreme , in which non - spherically symmetric contributions dominate the effective action ( and let experiment be the arbiter ) .",
    "it was shown  @xcite that for the simple sphaleron configuration @xmath241-wave unitarity is violated for @xmath242  tev . if for @xmath243 tev we saturate unitarity in each partial wave , then this yields a geometric parton cross section @xmath244 , where @xmath245 is some average size of the classical configuration . as a fiducial value we take the core size of the manton - klinkhamer sphaleron , @xmath246  cm . in this simplistic model , the @xmath24 cross section is @xmath247 where @xmath248 . in the region",
    "@xmath249 the pdf for the up and down quarks is well approximated by @xmath250 , so the expression for the cross section becomes @xmath251 where the last factor of 2/2 takes into account the ( mostly ) 2 contributing quarks @xmath252 in this range of @xmath253 and the condition that only the left - handed ones contribute to the scattering .",
    "this is about 80 times the sm cross section .",
    "of course this calculation is very approximate and the cross section can easily be smaller by a factor of 10 ( _ e.g. _ if @xmath245 is 1/3 of the fiducial value used ) .",
