    "in the context of the chemical evolution of the galaxies the supernova ( sn ) rate and its history play a fundamental role .",
    "but , while there are several theoretical models predicting the time evolution of the sn rates with time , observational determinations at different look - back times are not yet available .",
    "an estimate of the rate of snia at z@xmath4 has only be published so far ( pain et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the efforts of the high - z searches have been focused more on the detection and follow  up of the sne for the determination of the geometry of the universe than on the careful analysis of their databases for the sn rates .",
    "different is the case of the estimates of the rate in the local universe .",
    "searches of bright sne are active since several decades and their archives have been exploited to this purpose since the sixties .",
    "the determinations of the rates have been carried out on different samples and with different techniques . in some case",
    "the differences among various estimates are larger than 100 % . in this paper",
    "we discuss the reasons of these uncertainties and their relation to the chemical evolution of the galaxy .",
    "the sn rate is observationally defined in its general form as the number of sne exploding in a given sample of galaxies during a certain time interval    @xmath5    and is measured in yr@xmath6 . however , since the galaxies can have very different stellar content , one expects that the average value depends strongly on the composition of the galaxy sample . indeed , with the growing number of discoveries it appeared that critical parameters for the sn rates were the galaxy type , with late spirals more prolific than early spirals , and the galaxy luminosity , which in first approximation measures the number of available progenitor stars ( tammann 1970 , cappellaro & turatto 1988 ) .",
    "the sn rate can therefore be computed for each galaxy type as    @xmath7    where the index @xmath8 refers to the sample galaxies of that type and @xmath9 refers to the individual observations of each galaxy .",
    "convenient units for the rate are the snu , where 1 snu corresponds to 1 sn per @xmath10 solar luminosities per century . because of the normalization to galaxy luminosity , snu scale as h@xmath11 .",
    "the parameter @xmath12 accounts for various observational selection effects .",
    "it is evident from the last equation that in order to have better estimates of the sn rates one can : 1 ) enlarge the statistical samples ( n@xmath13 , n@xmath14 ) , 2 ) estimate with higher precision the surveillance times , or 3 ) determine more reliable correction terms for the selection effects .    for the sample selection",
    "there are in practice two alternatives .",
    "we can , for instance , select all galaxies within a given volume , making reasonable assumptions on the surveillance times ( cfr .",
    "tammann 1994 ) .",
    "consequently the sn rate is computed using all the sne discovered inside the volume during that period .",
    "the main advantage of this approach is in the large samples directly available form the galaxy and sn catalogues ( e.g. barbon et al .",
    "the drawback is in the critical assumption of the surveillance time which can hardly be the same for each galaxy .",
    "the alternative is the survey approach which limits the galaxies to those surveyed by a specific sn search and the sne to those discovered during the same search .",
    "the method allows for each galaxy a precise determination of the _ control time _ , i.e. the time during which a possible sn of a given type remains above the detection limit .",
    "this determination takes into account the distribution of the observations during the survey , the distance of the galaxy , the properties of the sn types and the observational limitations of the survey .",
    "the method , introduced already by zwicky ( 1938 ) , found several applications ( e.g. cappellaro & turatto 1988 , evans et al .",
    "1989 ) . in this case",
    "the drawback is the small size of the sample .    in order to overcome such limitation we developed a strategy to treat simultaneously the databases of several of sn searches ( cappellaro et al .",
    "1993 , 1997a ) . the use of the five sn searches listed in tab .",
    "[ searches ] led us ( cappellaro et al . 1999 ) to build the largest sample ever used for the determination of sn rates , 137 sne in 9346 rc3 galaxies , for a total control time of the sample of 24954 yr .",
    ".the pooled sn searches [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath15 +    also the colors of galaxies can be used as indicators of the stellar populations with bluer galaxies hosting younger , more massive stars .",
    "we computed the sn rates ( in snu(b ) ) in galaxies with different optical integrated colors ( cappellaro et al . 1999 ) .",
    "we found that the observed rate of snia is independent on the galaxy colors while the rate of core ",
    "collapse sne is higher in bluer spirals than in galaxies of the same morphological type but with redder colors .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the number of massive progenitors predicted by the star formation rate , derived by evolutionary synthesis models of galaxies with different colors , closely matches the observed number of core  collapse sne .",
    "supernovae are primary contributors to the chemical enrichment of the galaxies because they return to the ism the elements synthesized by the hydrostatic and explosive burning processes , with the exception of the material trapped in the condensed remnants of core ",
    "collapse sne . from a general point of view",
    "collapse sne , descending from young massive progenitors determine the enrichment in the early galactic evolution while supernovae of type ia are responsible of the heavy elements enrichment in the later phases of the galactic evolution on time scales which depend on the binary configuration and mass ratios .",
    "current efforts are devoted to determine the masses of enriched material released by different kinds of explosions given their relative frequency .    for type ii",
    "it is expected that the yields vary with the stellar mass , mass cut , explosion energy and neutron excess ( nakamura et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the effect of these parameters have been modeled theoretically but observational confirmations are still needed .",
    "the well studied explosions of sn  1987a , sn  1993j and sn  1994i with progenitor masses between 13 and 20 produced about 0.07 of .",
    "early works on the late light curves indicated that most snii produced similar amounts of radioactive material ( turatto et al .",
    "1990 ) . in the last years data have been accumulated which show a different scenario ( danziger , this meeting ) .",
    "in particular there seems to be an increase of the production for stars up to about 25 ( e.g. sn  1997ef , 0.15 of , and 1998bw , 0.7 ) after which the gravitational potential wins and a small mass is ejected due to fallback ( e.g. sn  1997d , 0.002of ; turatto et al .",
    "the variation of the mass cut as a function of the progenitor mass seems to account for the observed trends of iron peak element abundance ratios in stars of low metallicity ( nakamura et al .",
    "the study of a second object with an expected low production , sn  1999eu a twin of sn  1997d at early time , will help to strengthen this hypothesis .",
    "unfortunately the objects for which both the progenitor mass and the ejected mass are available is so limited that no kind of statistics is still possible .",
    "also for type ia sne , once considered a very homogeneous class , there is now evidence that the yields can be different .",
    "cappellaro et al .",
    "( 1997b ) showed that the photometric properties of snia require a range of a factor 10 of the radioactive material synthesized during the explosion ( 0.1 to 1 ) and a factor 2 in the total mass of the ejecta . from a theoretical point of view",
    "such variations can be accounted for with different precursor masses ( chandrasekhar and sub - chandrasekhar ) , and flame speeds .",
    "an attempt to determine the relative frequency of different type ia subtypes has been performed by cappellaro et al .",
    "( 1997a ) . again going to analyze very particular sn subtypes we faced the problem of poor statistics .",
    "for faint snia , producing small amounts of , we found an intrinsic rate about 1/4 of that of all snia although they constitute only 5% of all snia discoveries .",
    "also the percentage of snia producing large amounts of is expected to be small .",
    "in fact the observed number is relatively small although they are brighter than the average , hence easier to discover .",
    "the determinations by various authors of the rates of sne in the local universe are in substantial agreement although large differences are still present on the rates of individual sn types in specific galaxy types .",
    "improvements are possible in the treatment of the databases and in the analyses of the selection effects",
    ". however the slow increase of the statistics at low redshifts is the limiting factor .    on the contrary ,",
    "huge is the number of discoveries at high ( z@xmath16 ) redshifts thanks to the projects aiming to determine the geometry of the universe with the use of sne as distance indicators .",
    "the analysis of these databases can already allow the determination of the rates at such early epochs .",
    "data at intermediate redshifts are still missing . in order to cover this gap",
    "we have started a sn search in the southern hemisphere which is starting to produce the first interesting results ( sne 1999ey , 1999gt , 1999gu ) . in few years",
    "observational estimates of the sn rates at various look - back times will provide strong constraints to the galaxy evolutionary models .",
