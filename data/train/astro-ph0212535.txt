    "in the equilibrium state of a multi - component plasma the number density , @xmath3 , of particles of mass @xmath4 , is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the gravitational potential . in the high temperature intra - cluster medium ( icm ) ,",
    "light elements , helium ( he ) and hydrogen ( h ) , can diffuse fast enough to reach their equilibrium distribution in a hubble time .",
    "larger frictional drag forces work on heavier elements , but still we expect , at least partial segregation as a result of diffusion .    diffusion can have important consequences .",
    "fabian & pringle ( 1977 ) suggested diffusion as a possible explanation for the observed gradients in the iron abundance inside galaxy clusters . in their calculations iron ions sediment by a distance comparable to the radius of the cluster within a hubble time .",
    "for other elements they predicted the diffusion velocity to be proportional to @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the atomic number and @xmath9 is the charge of the ion .",
    "these calculations assumed that only protons apply appreciable drag forces on heavy elements .",
    "rephaeli ( 1978 ) claimed that by neglecting helium drag fabian & pringle overestimated the iron diffusion rate .",
    "helium sedimentation can potentially change the global observational properties of x - ray emission from rich clusters . as has been noted by qin & wu ( 2000 ) current estimates of cluster masses from x - ray observations , which rely on the assumption of constant mean molecular weight ,",
    "can be off by @xmath10 if helium is concentrated inside the core . here",
    "we also point out that by steepening the baryonic density profile helium sedimentation increases the x - ray emissivity in hot clusters .    in this paper",
    "we revisit the calculation of element sedimentation in the icm .",
    "we confirm the claim by rephaeli that helium drag on iron is comparable to that of protons .",
    "however , instead of hindering the sedimentation of iron and other heavy elements we show that helium acts as a catalyst .",
    "our analysis includes electric fields that are inevitably generated by segregation of charged elements .",
    "although these fields reduce the diffusion rate , the sedimentation time - scales of heavy elements are still several times shorter than previous estimates .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we present the basic equations and estimate the sedimentation speeds and time - scales . in ",
    "3 we discuss the equilibrium distribution as a limiting case of element sedimentation . we conclude in  4 .",
    "we write the equations governing the evolution of individual species in an icm of any composition .",
    "we do not consider magnetic fields in this paper , but include electric fields which must exist in any ionized plasma in a gravitational field ( eddington 1926 ) .",
    "let the icm be made of any number of species each made of particles characterized by mass @xmath4 and electric charge @xmath11 .",
    "we denote the local number density and velocity of a patch of matter of each species by @xmath3 and @xmath12 .",
    "then , the mass density is @xmath13 and the pressure is @xmath14 , where we have assumed that the icm is in local thermal equilibrium so all species share the same temperature @xmath15 . with this notation",
    "the equations are @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the electric field , and @xmath18 is the gravitational field ( force per unit mass ) .",
    "the constants @xmath19 are the time - scales for the drag forces acting on the species @xmath20 as a result of coulomb interactions with species @xmath21 .",
    "momentum conservation implies that @xmath22 .",
    "if @xmath23 then @xmath19 can be approximated by ( spitzer 1968 ) @xmath24 where the @xmath25 is the coulomb logarithm .",
    "the equations ( [ h2 ] ) must be supplied by additional relations that specify the electric field . to create an electric force comparable with gravitational and pressure forces",
    "a tiny fractional charge excess ( @xmath26 ) is sufficient .",
    "the additional relations can then be obtained by assuming charge neutrality and zero electric currents , i.e. , @xmath27      multiplying the equations ( [ h2 ] ) by @xmath28 and summing over all species yields @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the total local density of all species , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are , respectively , the mass - weighted mean velocity and total pressure , and @xmath33 is the gravitational field in the frame of reference moving with the velocity @xmath34 .",
    "the terms involving the electric and drag forces have disappeared by virtue of charge neutrality and momentum conservation , respectively .",
    "since @xmath35 is much smaller than the thermal velocities , the velocity dispersion term @xmath36 is negligible compared to the pressure and gravity terms we have not included it in the equation ( [ h1 ] ) .    at the initial stage of the diffusion process",
    "the dominant light species have the same distribution , which gives @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the mean molecular weight .",
    "thus equations ( [ h2 ] ) yield @xmath39 using equations ( [ h5 ] ) and ( [ h3 ] ) we find that the electric field is @xmath40 . from ( [ sp ] ) @xmath41 , so because of the low abundance of heavy ions and the low mass of electrons , only the drag terms from protons and helium ions is important .",
    "so we are left with a single equation for each element @xmath42    we can now estimate the velocity of each species relative to @xmath43 , the velocity of the proton fluid at each point .",
    "the advantage of using velocities relative to protons is the independence of the results from physical processes other than diffusion ( radiative cooling , heating by supernovae etc ) . even though these processes can have important dynamical effects on the cluster",
    ", they do not affect the expressions we develop for the relative velocities and element abundance .    from ( [ hs ] ) the helium velocity",
    "is @xmath44    the relative sedimentation speed of heavy elements , @xmath45 , can easily be related to that of helium @xmath46 .",
    "heavy elements experience an upward proton drag and inward helium drag forces . according to ( [ sp ] ) , @xmath47 and for large @xmath48",
    "these drag terms dominate all others in ( [ hs ] ) .",
    "thus we are left with @xmath49 substituting @xmath50 and @xmath51 from ( [ sp ] ) in the last equation yields @xmath52 where we have taken @xmath53 .",
    "thus , contrary to the prediction of fabian & pringle ( 1977 ) , who by neglecting helium drag obtained @xmath54 , the diffusion speeds are approximately the same for all heavy elements . including all forces in the calculation increases slightly this result ( by a factor of @xmath55 ) @xmath56 . \\label{ratspeed}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] there is also a correction of a similar magnitude if the initial distribution of heavy elements is different from that of light elements .",
    "the relation ( [ ratspeed ] ) is independent of the physical state of the icm . to obtain the relative velocities we have to know the temperature , the density and the gravitational acceleration . taking in ( [ sp ] ) @xmath57 as the typical value for the icm , we find the helium velocity relative to protons to be @xmath58 where @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 k. this is lower by @xmath62 than the result of qin & wu ( 2000 ) , the main difference is the inclusion of electric field in our calculation .",
    "as seen from equation ( [ speeds ] ) the diffusion speeds depend on the local density and temperature .",
    "however , a single diffusion time - scale is obtained if the gas and dark matter both follow an isothermal spherical density profile @xmath63 and the gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium ( @xmath64 ) with constant @xmath15 . in this case",
    "@xmath65 , which together with continuity equation , @xmath66 , yields , @xmath67 this motivates us to define the time - scale for diffusion between two species as @xmath68 which for helium relative to protons gives @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the baryonic mass fraction in the cluster .",
    "the diffusion time - scale of helium as seen from ( [ heliumtau ] ) is comparable to the hubble time .",
    "it is thus prudent to examine in detail the equilibrium distribution of hydrogen and helium , which is the final product of diffusion .",
    "we assume a spherically symmetric cluster in which the dark mass inside a radius @xmath71 is given by ( navarro , frenk & white 1997 ) @xmath72   \\ , , \\label{nfw}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are constants .",
    "the gas density profile , @xmath75 , is determined by the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium ( see eq.[h1 ] ) , @xmath76 where we have neglected the contribution of baryons to gravity and assumed constant temperature , @xmath15 , throughout the icm . in the absence of sedimentation",
    "@xmath77 is constant and the solution to ( [ hstat ] ) is ( makino , sasati , & suto 1998 ) @xmath78 where @xmath79 .",
    "sedimentation introduces a dependence of @xmath77 on @xmath71 and the above analytical solution is no longer valid .",
    "the abundances of the various elements are then determined by the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium for each element separately and the condition for local charge neutrality , @xmath80 taking @xmath81 and neglecting the electron mass , these equations have the solution @xmath82/ h^2(r)\\ ; , \\\\ n_\\alpha&=&c_1\\left[f(r)+f^{-1}(r)-1\\right]^2/ h^2(r)\\ ; , \\label{analytic : sol}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath83^{1/3}$ ] , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 and @xmath86 constants .",
    "the behavior of the solution in the inner and outer regions is easily understood as follows . in the inner regions helium",
    "is dominant , thus @xmath87 and @xmath88 . from this",
    "follows @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "note that , since the total force felt by protons becomes repulsive ( @xmath91 ) , their density is falling towards the center .",
    "the outer regions consist almost entirely of hydrogen plasma , thus @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "this gives @xmath94 and @xmath95 , and so @xmath96 , in agreement with gilfanov & syunyaev ( 1984 ) .",
    "the constants @xmath85 and @xmath86 in the analytic solution ( [ analytic : sol ] ) are fixed by the boundary conditions imposed on the abundances . here",
    "we require that the ratio of total helium to hydrogen abundances inside the virial radius is equal to the primordial value ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "we will present results for a cluster with gas temperature such that @xmath98 and a virial radius equal to @xmath99 in agreement with observations and n - body simulations of massive clusters ( nfw 1997 ; ettori & fabian 1999 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show as the solid line the baryonic density obtained from the analytic solution . for comparison",
    "we also plot as the dashed curve the profile ( [ nodiff ] ) which corresponds to equilibrium without diffusion .",
    "a proper estimation of the density profile from the observed x - ray emissivity ( @xmath100 ) should take into account variations of the he / h abundance ratio throughout the icm .",
    "assuming constant he / h ratio can yield a biased estimate of the profile .",
    "to demonstrate this we plot as the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the estimated profile if a constant abundance ratio were assumed . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the baryonic mass fraction as a function of radius for the same three cases as in fig .",
    "we see ( solid line ) that diffusion introduces distinct features in the behavior of the baryonic fraction as a function of radius .",
    "finally fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the number density of helium and hydrogen in the case with diffusion .",
    "we have seen that diffusion steepens the gas density profile near the center of hot clusters , increasing their x - ray luminosity ( by factor of 5 in our example ) . in colder clusters",
    "( @xmath101 k ) the diffusion time - scale is larger than the hubble time and their luminosity remains unchanged .",
    "this may explain the observed discrepancy between the observed @xmath102 ( mushotzky 1984 ; edge & stuwart 1991 ; david et al . 1993 ) and @xmath103 which is expected from self - similar arguments ( e.g. , kaiser 1986 ) .",
    "if the inner regions of clusters are dominated by helium then the baryonic mass density as inferred from the x - ray emissivity can be underestimated by @xmath104 if constant he / h abundance ratio is assumed , while in the helium - deficient outer region it can be overestimated by @xmath105 .",
    "estimates of of the dark matter density can be affected by even a larger factor .",
    "these estimates assume hydrostatic equilibrium ( eq .",
    "[ hstat ] ) , so by taking @xmath106 ( cosmic abundance ) instead of 0.5 ( pure hydrogen plasma ) in the outer regions , we underestimate the total mass by @xmath107 ( qin & wu 2000 ) . in the helium dominated core the mass would be overestimated by a factor of @xmath108 .",
    "our estimates of the sedimentation time - scales have neglected magnetic fields .",
    "magnetic fields with coherence length comparable to the size of the cluster force the ions to move on longer orbits defined by the field lines .",
    "this can increase the sedimentation time - scales by factor of a few .",
    "small - scale magnetic fields , however , can increase the time - scales by a factor ranging from a few in some estimates ( narayan & medvedev 2001 ; malyshkin 2001 ) to 100 - 1000 in others ( chandran & cowley 1998 ) .",
