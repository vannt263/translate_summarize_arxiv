    "for layer-1 , the haldane model of two - component fermions at @xmath4 filling under a strong zeeman field becomes a @xmath0 topological insulator .",
    "while for layer-2 , there is no zeeman fields , we get an s - wave sf state by tuning the interaction between fermion via feshbach resonance technique . thus due to the proximity effect , we get an effective @xmath0 tsf state . we also study its topological properties and then show the gapless majorana edge modes and the non - abelian statistics of the @xmath5-flux . this @xmath0 tsf",
