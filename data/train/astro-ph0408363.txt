    "about 20% of white dwarfs ( wds ) exhibit a deficiency or an absence of hydrogen on their surfaces , and their evolutionary paths into such states are not well understood . if planetary nebulae ( pne ) are found around different types of wds , the nebular properties may shed light on the evolutionary history of the stars .",
    "only hot wds can photoionize their nebulae and make them shine in h@xmath0 .",
    "therefore , @xcite searched for h@xmath0 emission around 5 hot wds and 4 sdo stars using a fabry - perot spectrometer , but he found emission only in the vicinity of the do wds pg0108 + 101 and pg0109 + 111 , which are within @xmath5 from each other .",
    "similarly , @xcite carried out a ccd imaging search for pne around 16 hot wds , but they detected h@xmath0 nebulosity in the vicinity of only pg0109 + 111 .",
    "it was uncertain whether this ionized gas belonged to the interstellar medium or an evolved pn . among the non - detections ,",
    "the hot do star kpd0005 + 5106 presents a puzzle because its far ultraviolet spectrum shows strong h@xmath6 absorption lines indicating the presence of dense interstellar or circumstellar gas @xcite . while this puzzle is partially solved by the recent detection of an emission nebula by @xcite ,",
    "there remain many other unusual properties of kpd0005 + 5106 .",
    "kpd0005 + 5106 has a stellar effective temperature of 120,000 k @xcite , which is hot enough to photoionize the -emitting nebula .",
    "it was the first wd reported to possess a corona heated by a wind , as its x - ray spectrum below 0.5 kev could be satisfactorily fitted only by emission models of he - rich plasma at temperatures of @xmath7 k @xcite .",
    "this ongoing wind outflow has been used to explain the detection of stellar emission and circumstellar absorption in the high - resolution uv spectra of kpd0005 + 5106 taken with the _ hst _ ghrs @xcite and _ iue _ swp @xcite .",
    "these explanations should be reconsidered in light of the recent discovery of hard x - ray emission from kpd0005 + 5106 near 1 kev @xcite .",
    "this hard x - ray emission is able to photoionize o@xmath8 ( ionization potential = 871 ev ) to produce the observed recombination line emission , but the origin of this hard x - ray emission is not clear .",
    "the hard x - ray spectrum of kpd0005 + 5106 indicates a plasma temperature greater than 10@xmath9 k , which is too high to be explained by the he - rich wind invoked by @xcite .",
    "hard x - ray emission is frequently associated with wds in binary systems and is attributed to the coronal activity of a late - type companion or the accretion of a companion s material onto the surface of a wd ; however , kpd0005 + 5106 does not show a near - ir excess and is not known to have a late - type companion @xcite .    to conduct a more sensitive search for a coronally active companion of kpd0005 + 5106",

    "it is not clear whether the apparent shell structure is associated with kpd0005 + 5106 or a result by chance superposition .",
    "as kpd0005 + 5106 has an effective temperature of 120,000 k @xcite , its photoionized region should have high excitation with high [ ] /h@xmath0 ratios .",

    "our echelle observations do not show any nebular emission at this velocity ; thus , we may rule out the expanding pn hypothesis .",
    "it is likely that the ionized nebula of kpd0005 + 5106 consists of interstellar material .",
    "the interstellar in this direction spans a wide range of velocities , but the main component is at roughly @xmath30 km s@xmath12 and has a smooth spatial distribution on scales of 5@xmath1110@xmath11 @xcite .",

    "the nebula ionized by kpd0005 + 5106 contains interstellar gas because its radial velocity is similar to that of the local interstellar medium and the nebular mass ( @xmath1070 m@xmath3 ) is much higher than those of planetary nebulae .",
    "the interstellar origin of the nebula removes the basis for the suggestion of a wind outflow from kpd0005 + 5106 - an offset of about + 50 km s@xmath12 between the nebular absorption line velocities and the photospheric line velocities .",
    "the recently discovered large ionized nebula around the hot do wd pg1034 + 001 @xcite also shows a nebular velocity similar to the circumstellar / interstellar absorption line velocities and the velocity of local interstellar gas but offset by about + 45 km s@xmath12 from the stellar photospheric line velocities @xcite .",
    "we suggest that the large ionized nebula around pg1034 + 001 is also interstellar in origin .",
    "the large ionized nebulae of kpd0005 + 5106 and pg1034 + 001 clearly demonstrate that hot wds contribute to the ionization of the interstellar medium .",
    "the brightest hot wds are also the nearest , within a few hundred pc ; thus , their photoionized interstellar nebulae would be angularly large so that the wham - nss provides the best data set to search for these nebulae .",
    "we have analyzed the hard x - ray luminosity of kpd0005 + 5106 . using the @xmath4 relation for typical late - type stars with active coronae and kpd0005 + 5106 s lack of obvious near - ir excess",
    ", we have excluded the possibility that a late - type companion s coronal activity is responsible for the hard x - ray emission from kpd0005 + 5106 .",
    "the stellar emission of kpd0005 + 5106 places useful constraints on the location of the hard x - ray source .",
    "our analysis of the nebular environment of kpd0005 + 5106 abrogates the previous suggestion of a wind outflow from kpd0005 + 5106 ; thus , a local hard x - ray radiation field is needed to photoionize o@xmath8 in order to produce the stellar emission .    we conclude that the most likely origin of the hard x - ray emission from kpd0005 + 5106 is the do wd itself , either from its photosphere or a corona , although such photospheric emission is not expected from the currently available stellar atmospheric models and there are no known mechanisms to generate hot coronae around hot wds . to further study the origin of hard x - ray emission from kpd0005 + 5106 , x - ray observations with high angular resolution and high sensitivity are needed to confirm the positional coincidence between the hard x - ray source and kpd0005 + 5106 and to obtain high - quality data for spectral analysis .",
    "future observations with _ chandra x - ray observatory _ and _ xmm - newton observatory _ are most desirable",
    ".    this research has used data from the wisconsin h - alpha mapper , which is funded by the national science foundation .",
