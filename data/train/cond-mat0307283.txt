    "bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) display remarkably rich nonlinear wave phenomena , among which solitons are particularly interesting . to date both common types of solitons , _ bright _ and _ dark",
    "_ , are experimentally realized in becs , respectively , with attractive and repulsive interatomic forces @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies of the properties of matter - wave solitons has resulted in successful description of basic features of soliton dynamics in bec @xcite .",
    "considerable effort is being devoted to investigation of bec in periodic potentials created by laser standing waves - so called optical lattices ( ol ) . subjecting a bec to a periodic potential leads to a number of interesting phenomena , including the formation of a specific class of localized modes called _ gap _ solitons .",
    "the definition gap refers to the fact that this type of solitons exist in the band gaps of the matter - wave spectrum .",
    "conceptually important point here is that , the gap solitons can be composed of repulsive atoms , which makes them favorable against bright solitons in continuous attractive bec tending to collapse at high atomic densities .",
    "after the first discussion of the possibility of bright solitons in repulsive bec loaded in ol @xcite , substantial theoretical research was performed aimed at understanding their development and properties @xcite .",
    "one of the recent advances in this direction has been the proof of the possibility of matter - wave solitons in two- and three - dimensional ( 2d and 3d ) ols .",
    "particularly , the emergence of multi - dimensional gap solitons in repulsive bec arrays due to the phenomenon of modulational instability was demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "different modes of stable 2d gap solitons in ols were shown to exist by numerical solution of the corresponding 2d gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite .",
    "multidimensional solitons in media governed by the self - focusing cubic nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) with a periodic potential , of which an attractive bec in ol is a particular example , are studied in @xcite by means of the variational approximation and direct numerical simulations .",
    "while have not been experimentally realized yet , bright matter - wave solitons in ols currently are among the intensively explored subjects in bec .",
    "an important aspect of ols is that they provide a unique possibility to investigate the behavior of localized excitations and solitons in both continuous and discrete ends of the spectrum by adjusting the strength of the ol . a fundamental issue that the cubic nlse does not support stable solitons in dimensions higher than one , while its discrete analog does , can be addressed more effectively involving the bec in ol .",
    "one relevant problem - the delocalizing transition of becs in deep 2d ols has recently been investigated in the framework of discrete nlse @xcite .",
    "the analysis of ref.@xcite is relevant to the tight - binding approximation , when the becs in neighboring lattice sites are weakly linked .",
    "this approach also relies on the possibility , that the tunneling amplitude between ol sites can be accurately determined . in the case of uniformly loaded ol",
    "the tunneling amplitude can be estimated using the wannier function basis @xcite . however , in the case of localized excitations involving just few lattice sites with significantly different occupation numbers , calculation of the tunneling amplitude becomes difficult .",
    "the aim of this paper is twofold .",
    "from one side we present a detailed numerical investigation of the delocalizing transition beyond the tight - binding approximation , when the system is described by the continuous mean - field equations . to this",
    "regard we provide both analytical and numerical evidences for the existence of stable multidimensional solitons in ols , and we study the fade and recovery of the solitonic structures as the strength of the optical lattice or coefficient of nonlinearity adiabatically varies in time .",
    "the major topic of interest will be a critical behavior of solitonic waveforms in a periodic potential , expressed as sudden disintegration of the soliton when the system parameters attain particular values .",
    "this will be done for becs with both positive and negative scattering lengths . from this study",
    "it emerges that the variational ansatz while correctly predicting the stabilization of solitons due to the ol , it fails to predict the existence of a delocalizing transition .    from the other side ,",
    "we address to the physical mechanism underlying the delocalizing transition . to this",
    "regard we propose a quantum interpretation of the phenomenon , by showing that the delocalizing transition is associated to the disappearance of bound states from the soliton effective potential in the underlying periodic schrdinger equation . since in one dimension",
    "any potential well can support at least one bound state ( this is true even for infinitesimal well depths ) , the above interpretation automatically implies that 1d solitons can not undergo delocalizing transitions .",
    "this is indeed what we find for the 1d case .",
    "in particular we show that by decreasing the strength of the ol or the nonlinearity in the system , the soliton becomes very extended ( in the limit of zero nonlinearity it reduces to a bloch state at the edge of the brillouin zone ) , but always recovers its original shape when the parameters are reversed .",
    "in contrast , in 2d and in 3d cases , we find that there is always a critical value of system parameters below which the recovering of the soliton becomes impossible i.e. the soliton irreversibly disintegrates into extended states . by approximating the soliton",
    "effective potential with a suitable solvable potential and by adopting a variational ansatz description for the soliton , we show that the above _ bound state interpretation _ leads to an analytical expression for the occurrence of the delocalizing transition which is in good agreement with direct numerical simulations of the gross - pitaevskii equation , this providing support for our approach .",
    "we remark that the proposed mechanism for the delocalizing transition is general and expected to be valid also for multidimensional intrinsic localized modes or discrete breathes of nonlinear lattices , as well as for multidimensional soliton solutions of the nlse with nonlocal interactions .",
    "finally , we have explored the role of dimensionality by comparison of results for 2d and 3d ols .",
    "the advantage of the present approach is that , all the system variables are readily connected to actual physical parameters ( e.g. the ol strength to the laser intensity and the coefficient of nonlinearity to the atomic scattering length , etc . ) , which makes the experimental verification more feasible .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the model and derive variational equations for soliton parameters .",

    "the existence region for 2d solitons is presented . in sec .",
    "iv we discuss the possibility of experimental observation of the delocalizing transition of solitons . finally , in sec .",
    "v we conclude the results of this study .",
    "the existence , stability and some other properties of solitons in 1d periodic potentials are explored in the context of repulsive bec in ols @xcite . solitons in self - focusing nlse with a 1d periodic potential , with relevance to particular problems of nonlinear optics is considered in @xcite . while the subject is well understood in 1d case , multidimensional solitons in periodic potentials are in early stage of research @xcite .",
    "below we analyze the existence of multidimensional solitons in periodic potentials in the framework of the variational approximation ( va ) for both attractive and repulsive interactions .",

    "the next step of the variational approach involves the choice of a suitable trial function - _ ansatz _ for the solution .",
    "as we shall see later , solitonic waveforms in attractive and repulsive becs in the periodic potential have different spatial features .",
    "this implies the choice of different trial functions , which we shall consider separately .",

    "the collapse of bec at some critical number of atoms @xmath29 is the main consequence of the self - focusing nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "the presence of a periodic potential , however , significantly changes the situation and leads to stable localized states . in moderately strong and weak periodic potentials ( which is the case at delocalizing transition point considered below ) multidimensional solitons have a single cell structure and",

    "the effect of dimensionality in the process of delocalizing transition of matter - wave solitons is of particular interest .",
    "since we consider the phenomenon as rapid spreading of the wave - packet through tunneling of bec into neighboring lattice sites , the main manifestation of the dimensionality should be the increased sharpness of the transition ( because of more neighboring cells compared to 2d case ) .    to verify the above conjecture",

    "this is another effect of higher dimensionality .",
    "addressing the possibility of experimental observation of phenomena considered in this paper , we note the rapid progress in manipulation techniques for bec in ols @xcite .",
    "however , the matter - wave solitons in periodic potentials of ols have not been experimentally realized yet .",
    "different approaches were proposed , of which particular interest is the generation of gap solitons in repulsive bec employing the phenomenon of modulational instability @xcite .",
    "another possibility is the independent successive formation of bec in single sites of the ol as proposed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the bec initially occupying a single or few lattice sites of the periodic potential quickly transforms into the solitonic waveform ( certainly , if the parameters are in the existence region ) , as revealed from the numerical simulations .",
    "after the matter - wave soliton is created , the delocalizing transition can be induced by decreasing the strength of the ol through the intensity of laser wave , or reducing the coefficient of nonlinearity by changing the atomic scattering length via the feshbach resonance .",
    "the signature of the phenomenon is sudden disintegration of the soliton at the critical point , therefore it will be accompanied by dropping of the atomic density , which can be detected by imaging techniques .",
    "the resolution of absorption - imaging systems currently in use ( which is @xmath124 m @xcite ) is sufficient for controlling the properties of bec in the range of a unit cell of the ol .",

    "higher or lower values of @xmath54 may be achieved by changing the density of the condensate @xmath18 , atomic scattering length @xmath5 , or @xmath135 .",
    "all three parameters can be changed independently .",
    "the strengths of ols considered above are in the range of usual experimental conditions @xcite @xmath136 in units of recoil energy @xmath137 .",
    "our numerical simulation times @xmath138 , well satisfying the adiabaticity condition , correspond to @xmath139 s. the average lifetime of bec in optical trap , limited by three - body collisions and off - resonant scattering of lattice photons is more than 3 s @xcite .",
    "therefore , observation of the delocalizing transition of solitons is possible in the present experimental conditions .",
    "we have studied the existence and delocalizing transition of multidimensional solitons in periodic potentials by means of the va and direct numerical integration of the gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "va provides the initial configuration for the soliton parameters which can be used in pde to generate a stable multidimensional soliton .",
    "the most interesting property of multidimensional ( 2d and 3d ) solitons observed in this study is the delocalizing transition , which is manifested as irreversible disintegration of the soliton at some critical strength of the periodic potential , or coefficient of nonlinearity .",
    "contrarily , 1d solitons do not exhibit the delocalizing transition , retaining their integrity over the whole range of parameter variations .",
    "we proposed a physical mechanism for delocalizing transition of solitons , according to which the existence of a soliton is associated with the existence of quantum bound states in the effective potential created by the soliton . at the point of delocalizing transition ,",
    "the effective potential has the critical strength to support only a single bound state .",
    "as the strength becomes weaker than the critical value , the effective potential can not support a bound state , and as a consequence , the soliton irreversibly disintegrates . using the exactly solvable pschl - teller potential as approximation for the effective potential created by the soliton",
    ", we analytically determined the existence region for 2d solitons .",
    "numerical simulations of the gross - pitaevskii equation have confirmed the validity of the proposed model .",
    "although we considered the problem with the emphasis on bose - einstein condensates in ols , multidimensional solitons and the phenomenon of delocalizing transition can be observed in other relevant systems , e.g. optically induced nonlinear waveguide arrays @xcite .",
