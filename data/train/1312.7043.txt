    "in such a case , the exploded materials can not be brighten by the radioactive decays of @xmath0ni and @xmath0co .",

    "we expect that aspherical cc sn explosion with a @xmath24 m@xmath1 co - core progenitor ejects @xmath0ni enough to reproduce the @xmath0ni yield observed in sn 2007bi .",
    "the degree of asphericity of the explosion reproducing observational features of sn 2007bi depends on progenitor mass and explosion energy .    the elemental yields of c , n , o , na , mg , and ca were measured using late - time spectra in sn 2007bi @xcite .",

    "the hidden amount of the ejecta is still quite uncertain .",
    "therefore , we consider that it is still difficult to discuss the differences between the yields evaluated in cc sn and pi sn models and the observed yields .",
    "it is important to find the relation between the ejecta containing such a huge mass and the emitted spectra .",
    "the ejecta velocities of sn 2007bi were estimated by using the spectra of o , fe , si , and ca in @xmath26 days @xcite .",

    "we note that the observed ejecta velocities do not indicate the bulk velocities of the ejecta .",
    "this is because the observed period is before the nebular phase and the velocities depend on the strength of absorption .",
    "thus , it is difficult to discuss explosion features from the comparison between the observed velocities and the evaluated ones . although we do not discuss the comparison between the observed and evaluated velocities , this evaluation will help understanding explosion features of slsne that will be observed in the future through the observations of the ejecta velocities in the nebular phase .",
    "figure 6 shows the ejected masses of o , fe , si , and ca as a function of the ejecta velocity and the opening angle .",
    "panels ( @xmath32)-(@xmath33 ) indicate the velocity distributions of the collapsed 250 m@xmath1 model .",
    "most of o ejecta have a velocity of @xmath34 km s@xmath28 with small opening - angle dependence .",
    "the minimum velocity and the amount of slower ejecta indicate more significant dependence on the opening angle .",
    "the minimum velocity is about 6,000 km s@xmath28 for spherical explosion and @xmath35 km s@xmath28 for the explosion with @xmath36 .",
    "the amount of slower o ejecta increases with decreasing opening angle of the explosion .",
    "the velocity distribution of fe ejecta also depends on the opening angle .",
    "the velocity range of the fe ejecta in the spherical explosion is @xmath37 km s@xmath28 , which is narrower than o for the spherical explosion .",
    "the velocity dispersion is caused by the large @xmath0ni production in wide spatial range of the innermost region .",
    "as the opening angle decreases , the maximum velocity becomes faster and slow ejecta increases . at the same time , the velocity dependence of the ejected amount becomes smaller . in the case of @xmath36",
    ", the velocity range extends to @xmath38 km s@xmath28 .",
    "both the ejecta masses of faster and slower components increase .",
    "the velocity dependence of si and ca masses moderately depends on the opening angle .",

    "we also show the velocity distributions of si and ca masses of the 110 m@xmath1 model in figs .",
    "6 ( @xmath40 ) and ( @xmath41 ) , respectively .",
    "although the velocity range is narrow in spherical explosion , the dependence of the velocity on the opening angle is similar to the 250 m@xmath1 model .",
    "thus , aspherical explosions of the collapsed models produce wide velocity dispersion of sn ejecta .",
    "we briefly discuss the velocity distributions in the uncollapsed models . when the opening angle of the explosion is small , the velocity distribution is larger than the corresponding collapsed model . in the case of the 250 m@xmath1 model with @xmath36 ,",
    "the o mass decreases to 1,500 km s@xmath28 and the fe , si , and ca masses increase up to 18,000 km s@xmath28 . in the case of the 110 m@xmath1 model with @xmath36 ,",
    "the fastest component of si and ca is 20,000 km s@xmath28 . on the other hand ,",
    "the velocity distributions of the explosion models reproducing the @xmath0ni mass of sn 2007bi are also similar to the spherical explosions of the collapsed models .",
    "these explosion models have moderate opening angles .    at last , spherical explosions indicated narrow ranges of the ejecta velocities for fe in the 110 and 250 m@xmath1 models and si and ca in the 110 m@xmath1 model . on the other hand , aspherical explosions indicated wider ranges of the ejecta velocities .",
    "an aspherical explosion causes wide velocity distribution of various elements even if large - scale mixing does not occur in late time .",
    "these characteristics of the velocity distribution would constrain sphericity of slsne .    the rise time",
    "is a parameter characterizing the light curve of a sn .",
    "spherical cc sn model in @xcite reproduced the light curve of sn 2007bi .",
    "they evaluated the light curve assuming three cases of ejecta mixing and obtained the rise time of 52 days ( full mixing ) , 67 days ( half mixing ) , and 85 days ( without mixing ) .",
    "they also reproduced the light curve by a pi sn model .",
    "the obtained rise time is @xmath42 days .",
    "the rise time can be approximately estimated as the relation @xmath43 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the rise time is roughly evaluated as @xmath44 days using @xmath45 for the cc explosion model in @xcite . taking account of the uncertainties in the rise time and the mixing , we consider that the range of @xmath46 available for the rise time of sn 2007bi is between 4.2 ( short rise time and without mixing ) and 11.2 ( long rise time and full mixing ) . here",
    "we discuss the rise time of our sn models taking account this dependence .    in spherical explosions , we investigated the dependence on the explosion energy . the rise time becomes shorter with increasing in the explosion energy .",
    "when the explosion energy is between @xmath47 and 100 , where the @xmath0ni yield of sn 2007bi is reproduced , the range of @xmath46 is @xmath48 and @xmath49 for the 110 and 250 m@xmath1 models , respectively .",
    "thus , these explosion models would reproduce the light curve of sn 2007bi if ejecta mixing is appropriate .    in aspherical explosions , we investigated the dependence on the opening angle with a given explosion energy",
    ". since the ejecta mass increases with the opening angle , the rise time also increases .",
    "the range of @xmath46 is @xmath50 and @xmath51 for the collapsed ( uncollapsed ) 110 and 250 m@xmath1 models .",
    "the rise time of the 250 m@xmath1 models seems to be close to that in the cc sn model in @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the rise time of jet - like explosion of the 110 m@xmath1 models would be small . among the explosion models reproducing the @xmath0ni yield of sn 2007bi ,",
    "the minimum value of @xmath46 is 5.77 ( 6.08 ) and 7.20 ( 6.92 ) for the collapsed ( uncollapsed ) 110 and 250 m@xmath1 models .",
    "thus , we expect that spherical and aspherical cc explosion models reproducing the @xmath0ni yield of sn 2007bi would also reproduce the light curve of sn 2007bi .      in our progenitor models , a small amount , less than 1 m@xmath1 , of he remains in the outer layer .",
    "pi sn models for sn 2007bi suggested in @xcite would also remain he in the envelope .",
    "the he amount hidden in an sn ic is an unclarified problem .",
    "he lines appear through the excitation of he by non - thermal electrons induced by @xmath52-rays from @xmath0ni and @xmath0co .",
    "the strength of the lines complexly depends on the amounts of he and @xmath0ni and other elements to thermalize electrons .",
    "the he amount hidden in @xmath53 m@xmath1 sn ic ejecta was evaluated in @xcite .",
    "the he amount hidden in more massive sne ic should be investigated for discussing the possibilities of sne ic from metal - poor very massive stars and pi sne ic .      a star with @xmath54 m@xmath1 experienced ppi during the si burning .",
    "although eruptive mass loss is induced by ppi , we did not consider this effect .",
    "the mass lost during ppi for the he star models with @xmath55 m@xmath1 was investigated in @xcite ( see their supplementary information ) .",
    "they obtained that the mass of @xmath56 m@xmath1 was lost during ppi and the final mass ranges in @xmath57 m@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite evaluated the mass lost in one pulsation of ppi for metal - poor rotating stars .",
    "the pre - ppi sn stars with @xmath58 m@xmath1 lost the mass of @xmath59 m@xmath1 .",
    "thus , we expect that the 250 m@xmath1 star in this study will become @xmath60 m@xmath1 after ppi . in this case",
    ", explosion feature of the sn will be similar to the sn explosion of the 110 m@xmath1 model ( 43 m@xmath1 progenitor ) and aspherical explosion reproducing the @xmath0ni yield of sn 2007bi would be possible .",
    "the above two studies also discussed the possibility that the collisions of the ejected material with the earlier ejecta during ppi induce very bright events like slsne .",
    "recently , analytical light curve models indicated that the light curve of sn 2007bi can be explained by the collision of sn ejecta with hydrogen - deficient circumstellar matter in addition to the radioactive decays of @xmath0ni and @xmath0co of @xmath61 m@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "in this case , less energetic explosion is possible .",
    "we set the explosion energy of @xmath62 and 70 for the 110 m@xmath1 and 250 m@xmath1 sn models , respectively .",
    "such energetic explosions have been estimated through observations in type ic sn 1999as and grb 031203/sn 2003lw ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "there are some possibilities of the explosion mechanism of aspherical cc sne .",
    "one is a launch of the relativistic jet driven by magnetar formation(e.g .",
    "another is a black - hole and accretion disk formation and the consequent jet production , i.e. , collapsar scenario@xcite .",
    "these mechanisms would have induced an aspherical energetic explosion and the explosion would have produced the @xmath0ni yield observed in sn 2007bi .",
    "sne ic associated with gamma - ray bursts ( grb / sne ic ) have been found in host galaxies having similar metallicities to the host galaxy of sn 2007bi @xcite .",
    "grb is a highly jet - like event and grb / sne ic were observed as jet - like explosions @xcite .",
    "broad - lined type ic sne also have been found in slightly metal - richer environments than the host galaxies of grb / sne ic .",
    "discussion of the relation between these sne ic and slsne ic like sn 2007bi would be important for clarifying the sn events during galactic chemical evolution .",
    "we should note that such an extreme energetic cc explosion has not been observationally ruled out , although the explosion mechanism has not been theoretically established .",
    "we showed in this study the possibility of such an extreme energetic cc explosion enough to explain the @xmath0ni yield of sn 2007bi within uncertainties in the mass loss rate in very massive stars .",
    "as a significance of this study , we consider that this study will extend to future studies to clarify if such an explosion is possible or not .",
    "there are several slsne expected to be the explosions from very massive stars .",
    "sn 1999as showed the light curve similar to sn 2007bi in photospheric phase @xcite and more than 4 m@xmath1 of @xmath0ni was estimated to be ejected @xcite .",
    "recently , ptf10nmn observed by the palomar transient factory and ps1 - 11ap found by the panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system 1 were suggested to be candidates of pi sne ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "additional two slsne were also observed at redshifts @xmath63 and 3.90 .",
    "they are also candidates of a pi sn and a ppi sn from photometric and far - ultraviolet data @xcite .",
    "very recently , the observations of ptf12dam and ps1 - 11ap were reported and magnetar - energized ejecta were proposed @xcite . although the event rate of such slsne is very small , the measurements of the slsne , which help constraining explosion mechanism and progenitor mass of each sn , will increase in future .",
    "we have investigated the dependence of the final mass and the fate on the ms mass and the metallicity of massive stars .",
    "we expect that very massive stars with @xmath64 m@xmath1 and @xmath2 become cc slsne ic like sn 2007bi .",
    "metal - poorer stars would explode as sne ii or sne ib even if they explode as pi sne .",
    "stars with @xmath65 m@xmath1 and @xmath4 would become ppi sne ic if the whole h and he layers is lost during ppi .",
    "the evaluation of the he amount in sn ejecta of very massive stars to make he lines is important for determining sn types .",
    "we also investigated the dependence of the total ejecta mass and the yields of @xmath0ni , o , and si on the explosion energy as well as asphericity of the cc sn models with @xmath66 m@xmath1 and 250 m@xmath1 and @xmath5 . in the case of spherical explosions ,",
    "the yield of @xmath0ni produced in the sn increases with the explosion energy .",
    "the sn explosion with @xmath67 produces the @xmath0ni amount enough to reproduce the amount observed in sn 2007bi . in the case of aspherical explosions , the total ejecta mass and the yields of @xmath0ni , o , and si increase with the opening angle .",
    "the aspherical cc sne of the collapsed 110 m@xmath1 and 250 m@xmath1 models reproduce the @xmath0ni yield observed in sn 2007bi . in the uncollapsed progenitor models ,",
    "moderately aspherical cc sne also reproduce .",
    "these sne indicate the velocity distribution up to @xmath68 km s@xmath28 in o , si , ca , and fe . therefore , an aspherical cc sn explosion evolved from a very massive star is a possibility for the explosion of sn 2007bi .",
