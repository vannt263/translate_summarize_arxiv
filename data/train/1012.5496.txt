    "each nucleosome consists of a 147 bp - long dna segment wrapped around a histone octamer in @xmath0 turns of a left - handed superhelix @xcite .",
    "in addition to its primary function of dna compaction , chromatin modulates dna accessibility to transcription factors and other molecular machines , affecting gene transcription as well as dna repair , maintenance , and replication . in _",
    "s. cerevisiae _",
    ", arrays of nucleosomes cover @xmath1 of genomic dna , exerting profound influence on gene regulatory programs @xcite .    because the free energy of bending a dna segment into a superhelix will vary depending on its nucleotide sequence and composition @xcite ,",
    "nucleosomes exhibit a range of _ in vitro _",
    "formation energies @xcite ( although almost any dna sequence can be packaged into a nucleosome ) .",
    "recent work has clarified the role of sequence rules that influence nucleosome positioning : genome - wide _ in vitro _",
    "reconstitution experiments have confirmed that nucleosome architecture over promoters and genes is partially established by dna sequence , mostly as a result of nucleosome depletion from a / t - rich , nucleosome - disfavoring sequences on both ends of the transcript @xcite .",
    "however , even if genomic dna from _ s. cerevisiae _ is mixed with histones in a 1:1 mass ratio ( leading to the maximum nucleosome occupancy of @xmath2 which is close to the _ in vivo _",
    "value @xcite ) , nucleosomes are not strongly localized and , on average , nucleosome occupancy is just @xmath3 lower over nucleosome - depleted regions ( ndrs ) compared to the mean occupancy in a window which includes both the coding region and adjacent sequence .",
    "the absence of nucleosome localization _ in vitro _ and shallow ndrs indicate that the absolute magnitude of intrinsic histone - dna interactions is less than @xmath4 .    _ in vivo _ , 5 and 3 ndrs flanking the transcript are much more pronounced ( @xmath5 occupancy depletion on average with respect to the mean @xcite ) , establishing a striking pattern of nucleosome localization over genic regions simply due to steric exclusion which causes nucleosomes to `` phase off '' potential barriers @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hardrodsconfig ] ) .",
    "although the exact nature of these _ in vivo _ barriers is unknown and may vary between cell types and environmental conditions , they are likely established through a combined action of rna polymerase , atp - dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes and dna - binding proteins @xcite .    $ ] bp window .",
    "the intensity of the blue color is proportional to the degree of nucleosome localization . , width=307 ]    nucleosome positions and formation energies can be predicted using a thermodynamic model which takes intrinsic histone - dna sequence preferences and one - dimensional steric exclusion into account @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "sequence determinants of nucleosome energetics are inferred directly from experimentally available nucleosome occupancy profiles .",
    "the profiles are obtained by isolating and sequencing mononucleosomal dna on a large scale , followed by mapping nucleosomal sequence reads to the reference genome @xcite . however",
    ", structural regularity of the chromatin fiber imposes additional constraints on nucleosome positions @xcite : linkers between neighboring nucleosomes become preferentially discretized with the @xmath6 bp periodicity of dna helical twist @xcite .",
    "the discretization is required to avoid steric clashes caused by the nucleosome rotating with respect to the linker dna axis as the linker increases in length @xcite , and more generally to maintain a regular pattern of protein - protein and protein - dna contacts in the chromatin fiber @xcite .",
    "indeed , adding a short dna segment to the linker will rotate the nucleosome with respect to the rest of the fiber , causing disruption of its periodic structure .",
    "the disruption is minimized if the length of the extra segment is a multiple of @xmath6 bp , which brings the nucleosome into an equivalent rotational position .",
    "we have recently developed a rigorous approach in which linker length discretization is described by nearest - neighbor two - body interactions in a system of non - overlapping finite - size particles @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nucleosomessketch ] ) .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to infer one - body energies given by intrinsic histone - dna interactions simultaneously with two - body energies caused by chromatin fiber formation .",
    "the two - body potential can be deduced even in the presence of one - body energies related to rotational positioning of the nucleosome @xcite , which have the same @xmath6 bp helical twist periodicity .",
    "we have predicted the two - body interaction from high - throughput maps of nucleosome positions on the _ s. cerevisiae _ genome , and demonstrated its essential role in forming nucleosome occupancy patterns over genic regions .",
    "each nucleosome covers dna sequence ( represented by colored boxes ) which gives the one - body energy of the nucleosome , @xmath7 .",
    "the one - body energy is represented by gray bars . for simplicity , in this toy model",
    ", the one - body energy is entirely determined by the base pair located at the starting position of the nucleosome . in more realistic scenarios",
    "one - body energy is a function of the entire sequence occupied by the nucleosome .",
    "the two - body interaction @xmath8 acts only between neighboring nucleosomes , with two indices @xmath9 and @xmath10 representing their starting positions . ]    here we present a detailed account of our theoretical framework .",
    "we also show that sequence determinants of nucleosome positioning can be obtained with an interaction - free model @xcite , even if in reality the two - body potential and histone - dna interactions have comparable magnitudes . to this end",
    ", we develop a minimally constrained sequence - specific model of nucleosome energetics in which the same energies are assigned to mono- and dinucleotides regardless of their exact position within the 147 bp nucleosomal site @xcite .",
    "however , only by taking into account the two - body interaction can we make a clear distinction between the two types of energies which dictate nucleosome positioning .",
    "finally , we build a minimal model in which _ in vivo _ nucleosomes are positioned solely by potential barriers located at each end of the transcript . without invoking explicit sequence specificity , the model successfully reproduces nucleosome occupancy patterns observed _ in vivo _ in _",
    "s. cerevisiae_. in contrast , sequence - dependent models can only capture liquid - like , delocalized behavior observed with _ in vitro _",
    "nucleosomes @xcite .",
    "by combining the minimal model with sequence - specific nucleosome energies , we estimate that intrinsic histone - dna interactions contribute @xmath11 to the height of the _ in vivo _ potential barriers .",
    "we consider the problem of interacting hard rods of length @xmath12 bp confined to a one - dimensional lattice of length @xmath13 bp ( the length of the dna segment ) ( fig .",
