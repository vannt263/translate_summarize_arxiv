    "the thermal conductivity of both single - layer and few - layer graphene is of current experimental and theoretical interest ( see a recent review  @xcite and the references therein ) . it was shown that the heat conduction in graphene has a specific behaviour due to the unique nature of two - dimensional phonons .",
    "main attention has been attracted to studies of the heat transfer in graphene near room temperature because of possible applications in electronics and photonics .    in this paper , we focus on the thermal conductivity in graphene at low temperatures .",
    "our interest is stimulated by recent observations that the large - scale graphene films are typically polycrystalline  @xcite and consist of many single - crystalline grains separated by grain boundaries ( gb )  @xcite .",
    "the grain sizes are dependent on growth conditions , ranging from hundreds of nanometres to tens of micrometres for slight changes in growth conditions  @xcite .",
    "recently , the fabrication of nanocrystalline graphene made by electron - radiation induced cross - linking of aromatic self - assembled monolayers and their subsequent annealing was reported  @xcite .",
    "nanosized grain boundary loops originating from paired five- and seven - membered ring disclinations were observed and analysed in  @xcite .",
    "the gb - induced phonon scattering has a marked impact on the thermal conductivity , @xmath2 , at low temperatures . in bulk materials ,",
    "the well - pronounced crossover from @xmath3 to @xmath4 has been proved with the crossover temperature strongly depending on the gb size  @xcite .",
    "therefore , one can expect a similar effect in two - dimensional polycrystalline materials like graphene .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we overview the general formalism with three main acoustic phonon branches taken into account : longitudinal ( la ) , transverse ( ta ) and flexural ( za ) .",
    "the effective temperatures characterizing the phonon mean free paths for main scattering mechanisms are introduced .",
    "the results of numerical calculations of the thermal conductivity are presented in section 3 .",
    "conclusion is devoted to the discussion of the results obtained .",
    "according to  @xcite , the phonon thermal conductivity of single - layer graphene can be written as @xmath5 where summation is performed over the phonon polarization branches with the dispersion relations @xmath6",

    "the phonon mean free path , @xmath14 , is limited by three major independent scattering mechanisms : sample borders ( rough boundary ( rb ) ) , point defect ( pd ) , and grain boundary . within the relaxation - time approximation",

    "the phonon - rb scattering is given by  @xcite @xmath18 with @xmath19 being the specularity parameter defined as a probability of specular scattering at the sample borders and @xmath20 the graphene layer size .",
    "the phonon - pd scattering can be written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the cross - section area per one atom of the lattice and @xmath23 is the measure of the scattering strength .",
    "it was suggested in  @xcite that grain boundaries can be naturally described by disclinations . in graphene , the alternating pentagon - heptagon structure along",
    "high - angle gbs was revealed in  @xcite .",
    "this finding allows us to model the grain boundary by biaxial wedge disclination dipole ( bwdd ) of length @xmath24 which consists of 5 - 7 pairs ( see fig .",

    "exceeds eight lattice translations .",
    "notice that the whole wall corresponds to a single bwdd . ]",
    "generally , there are six phonon branches . however ,",
    "at low temperatures only three branches are of importance : acoustic longitudinal ( la ) and transversal ( ta ) phonons with the ordinary dispersion relation @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) and out - of - plane ( flexural ) acoustic phonon branch ( za ) with @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is an effective parameter  @xcite , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are graphene 2d mass density and bending stifness , respectively . notice that at sufficiently low temperatures the umklapp processes of phonon - phonon scattering are mainly frozen and can be neglected .",

    "we have introduced here three characteristic temperatures : @xmath46 for pd scattering , @xmath47 and @xmath48 for gb scattering . in order to clarify the role of",

    "@xmath49 for @xmath50 ( the short wavelength limit ) . as is shown below , typically @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , namely @xmath52 defines the region of marked influence of phonon - gb scattering and can be considered as a threshold temperature .",
    "it should be also mentioned that @xmath52 characterizes the temperature when the wavelength of an incident phonon becomes comparable with the size of grain boundary .    to take into account the imperfect packing of grains",

    "we use the upper limit for the specular graphene thickness parameter @xmath78 from  @xcite .",
    "one should also note that the differences in the recent theoretical and experimental models give rise to the discrepancy in the determination of certain graphene constants ( see the discussion in  @xcite for detail ) .",
    "however , this discrepancy will not play crucial role for the effects discussed below .    using the constants defined above , one obtains @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 .",

    "the rough - boundary scattering is found to play an important role over the whole considered temperature range ( 0 - 100 k ) . on the contrary ,",
    "the point defect scattering manifests itself only at the upper limit of the temperature interval .",
