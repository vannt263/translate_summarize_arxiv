    "the purpose of this paper is to sketch a classification of birational transformations based on various notions of `` complexity '' . in previous papers  @xcite",
    "an analysis , based on the examination of the successive ( bi)rational expressions corresponding to the iteration of some given birational mappings , has been performed .",
    "when one considers the degree @xmath0 of the numerators ( or denominators ) of the corresponding successive rational expressions for the @xmath1-th iterate , the growth of this degree is ( generically ) exponential with @xmath1 : @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath3 has been called the `` growth complexity ''  @xcite and it is closely related to the arnold complexity  @xcite . a semi - numerical analysis , enabling to compute these growth complexities @xmath4 for these birational transformations , has been introduced in  @xcite .",
    "it has been seen , on particular sets of birational transformations  @xcite , that these `` growth complexities '' correspond to a remarkable spectrum of _ algebraic _ values  @xcite .",
    "these `` growth complexities '' , summing up the ( asymptotic ) evolution of the _ degree _ of the successive iterates , amount to seeing these mappings as mappings of ( two ) _ complex _ variables .",
    "however , when one considers the phase portrait of these mappings , one also gets some `` hint '' of the `` complexity '' of these mappings seen as mappings of ( two ) _ real _ variables . in the following ,",
    "we will consider a one - parameter dependent birational mapping of two variables . on this very example , it will be seen , considering phase portraits corresponding to various values of the parameter , that these `` real complexities '' vary for the different ( positive ) values of the parameter .",
    "two universal ( or `` topological '' ) measures of the complexities were found to identify  @xcite , namely the ( asymptotic of the ) _ arnold complexity_@xcite ( or growth complexity ) and the ( exponential of the ) _ topological entropy _  @xcite .",
    "the topological entropy is associated with the exponential growth @xmath5 of the number of fixed points ( real or complex ) of the @xmath6-th iterate of the mapping : looking at various phase portraits , corresponding to different values of the parameter ( see below ) , it is tempting to define , in an equivalent way , a `` real topological entropy '' associated with the exponential growth @xmath7 of the number of _ real fixed points only _ of the @xmath6-th iterate of the mapping .",
    "this notion of `` real topological entropy '' would actually correspond to the `` visual complexity '' as seen on the phase portrait of the mapping .",
    "such a concept , corresponding to the evaluation of the real complexity @xmath8 of the mapping seen as a mapping bearing on _ real _ variables , would be less universal : it would have only `` some '' of the remarkable topological universal properties of the topological entropy . similarly , it is also tempting to slightly modify the definition of the _ arnold complexity _  @xcite .",
    "the arnold complexity  @xcite , which corresponds ( at least for the mappings of two variables ) to the degree growth complexity  @xcite , is defined as the number of ( real or complex ) intersections of a given ( generic and complex ) line with its @xmath6-th iterate : it is straightforward to similarly define a notion of `` real arnold complexity '' describing the number of _ real _ intersections of a given ( generic ) _ real _ line with its @xmath6-th iterate .",
    "this real - analysis concept is , at first sight , also very well - suited to describe the `` real complexity '' of the mapping as it can be seen in the phase portrait ( see fig.[f : fig2 ] below ) .",
    "recalling the identification , seen on this one - parameter family of birational mappings , between the ( asymptotic of the ) arnold complexity and the ( exponential of the ) topological entropy  @xcite , it is natural to wonder if this identification also works for their `` real '' partners , or if , as the common wisdom could suggest , real analysis is `` far less universal '' , depending on a lot of details and , thus , requires a `` whole bunch '' of `` complexities '' ( lyapounov dimensions , ... ) to be described properly .",
    "in order to see the previous identification even more clearly , one can also slightly modify the definition of the dynamical zeta function , introducing a `` real dynamical zeta function '' associated with the counting of the real cycles only , and , similarly , one can also introduce some `` real arnold complexity '' generating functions .",
    "we will show that several of these two `` real '' generating functions have the same singularities .",
    "furthermore we will actually conjecture several _ simple rational expressions _ for them , yielding , again , _ algebraic values _ for the ( exponential of the ) `` real topological entropy '' .",
    "in particular , when the parameter of our family of birational transformations becomes large , we will get an interesting non trivial rational expression .",
    "these rational results for real mappings can not be simply understood by any `` obvious '' markov s partition , or symbolic dynamics hyperbolic interpretation .",
    "a _ one - parameter _ family of birational mappings of _ two _ ( complex ) variables has been introduced in previous papers  @xcite ( see definition ( 3 ) in  @xcite ) .",
    "this mapping actually originates from a lattice statistical mechanics framework that will not be detailed here  @xcite . in the following",
    ", we will use the extreme simplicity of this mapping of _ two _ ( complex ) variables to first compare two quite universal ( topological ) notions of `` complexity '' namely the growth complexity @xmath9 , which measures the exponential growth of the _ degree _ of the successive rational expressions encountered in an iteration ( a notion which coincides with the ( asymptotic of the ) _ arnold complexity _ is proportional ( for plane maps ) to @xmath0 , the degree of the @xmath10-th iteration of the birational mapping which behaves like @xmath2 .",
    "this `` degree notion '' was also introduced by a. p. veselov in exact correspondence with the general arnold definition  @xcite .",
    "note that the concept of arnold complexity _ is not _ restricted to two - dimensional maps . ]",
    "@xcite ) , and the ( exponential of the ) _ topological entropy _  @xcite . in section ( [ bsome ] ) , we will go a step further and compare , more particularly , the notion of _ `` real '' arnold complexity _ versus the notion of _ `` real '' topological entropy_. these two notions will be seen to be suitable to describe the properties of the mapping seen as a mapping of _ real _ variables .",
    "let us consider the following birational transformation ( see ( 3 ) in  @xcite ) of two ( _ complex _ ) variables @xmath11 , depending on one parameter @xmath12 : @xmath13    in spite of its simplicity , this birational mapping can , however , have quite different behaviors according to the actual values of the parameter @xmath12 . for example , for @xmath14 , as well as @xmath15 , 1/2 , 1/3 or 1 , the mapping becomes _ integrable _ , whereas it is not  @xcite for all other values of @xmath16 .",
    "let us now compare , in the following , two notions of `` complexity '' ( _ arnold complexity versus topological entropy _ ) according to various values of @xmath17 .",
    "the ( growth ) complexity @xmath19 , which measures the exponential growth of the degrees of the successive rational expressions one encounters in the iteration of the birational transformation ( [ yz ] ) , can be obtained by evaluating the degrees of the numerators , or equivalently of the denominators , of the successive ( bi)rational expressions obtained in the iteration process .",
    "one can actually build a _ semi - numerical method _",
    "@xcite to get the value of the complexity growth @xmath18 for any value of the parameter @xmath12 .",
    "the idea is to iterate , with the birational transformation ( [ yz ] ) , a generic _ rational _ initial point @xmath20 and to follow the magnitude of the successive numerators , or denominators , of the iterates . during the first few steps some accidental simplifications may occur , but , after this transient regime , the integer denominators ( for instance ) grow like @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the number of iterations .",
    "typically , a best fit of the logarithm of the numerator as a linear function of @xmath22 , between @xmath23 and @xmath24 , gives the value of @xmath25 within an accuracy of @xmath26 .",
    "let us remark that an _ integrable mapping _ yields a _ polynomial growth _ of the calculations  @xcite : the value of the complexity @xmath18 has to be numerically very close to @xmath27 .",
    "fig.[f : fig1 ] shows the values of the complexity growth @xmath4 as a function of the parameter @xmath12 .",
    "one remarks on fig.[f : fig1 ] that all the values of @xmath28 ( except a zero measure set ) give a growth complexity @xmath29 .",
    "the calculations have been performed using an infinite - precision c - library  @xcite .",
    "this semi - numerical analysis  @xcite clearly indicates , that , beyond the known integrable values  @xcite of @xmath30 , namely @xmath31 , two sets of values @xmath32 and @xmath33 are singled out .",
    "this suggests that the growth complexity @xmath4 takes lower values than the generic one on two infinite sequences of values of @xmath34 , namely @xmath35 and @xmath36 for @xmath22 and @xmath37 integers such that @xmath38 and @xmath39 and @xmath40 odd .",
    "one can revisit all these results using the stability of the factorization schemes , performing exact formal ( maple ) calculations .",
    "for instance , one can consider , for various values of @xmath41 , the degrees of the successive rational expressions one encounters when performing the successive iterates , and build various generating functions matrices  @xcite .",
    "these generating functions , denoted @xmath42 in  @xcite , are deduced from the existence of remarkable stable _ factorization schemes _",
    "these results are in complete agreement with the one given here for the mapping of two variables ( [ yz ] ) ( see for instance equations ( 11 ) , ( 12 ) , ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) in  @xcite ) . ] corresponding to these successive degrees .",
    "in particular , having singled out a set of values of @xmath28 , one can revisit these various values , to see how the generic growth complexity @xmath43 gets modified , and deduce the degree generating functions , and the associated complexity @xmath4 , in each case .",
    "let us denote by @xmath44 the degree generating function , corresponding , for some given value of the parameter @xmath12 , to the degree of ( for instance ) the numerator of the @xmath45 component of the successive rational expressions obtained in the iteration process of transformation ( [ yz ] ) .    at this step ,",
    "it is worth recalling , again , the notion of arnold complexity  @xcite which corresponds to iterate a given ( complex ) line and count the number @xmath46 of intersections of this @xmath1-th iterate with the initial line .",
    "it is straightforward to see that these arnold complexity numbers @xmath47 are closely linked to these successive degrees ( see for instance  @xcite ) .",
    "actually , if one considers the iteration of the @xmath48 line ) , ( [ rac ] ) ) . ] , the generating function of the @xmath47 s _ `` almost '' identifies _",
    "( often up to a simple @xmath49 factor ) with the degree generating functions @xmath50 .",
    "the `` arnold '' generating functions @xmath51 , and the degree generating functions @xmath50 , read ( up to order fifteen for the `` arnold '' generating functions and order ten , or eleven , for the degree generating functions ) : @xmath52 where the expression for @xmath53 is valid for @xmath28 generic and the expressions for @xmath54 are valid for @xmath55 , the @xmath56 for @xmath57 with @xmath58 odd .",
    "one also has for various integrable value of @xmath59 : @xmath60    these various exact generating functions are in agreement with the previous semi - numerical calculations .",
    "in particular , the first expression in ( [ firsteq ] ) yields an algebraic value for @xmath61 in agreement with the generic value of the complexity @xmath43 of fig.[f : fig1 ] ( and fig.1 in  @xcite ) .",
    "it is well known that the periodic orbits ( cycles ) of a mapping @xmath62 strongly `` encode '' dynamical systems  @xcite .",
    "the fixed points of the @xmath1-th power of the mapping being the cycles of the mapping itself , their proliferation with @xmath1 provides a `` measure '' of chaos  @xcite . to keep track of this number of cycles",
    ", one can introduce the fixed points generating function @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the number of fixed points of @xmath65 , _ real or complex_. this quantity only depends on the number of fixed points , and _ not _ on their particular localization . in this respect , @xmath66 is a _ topologically invariant quantity_. the same information can also be coded in the so - called function , by artin and mazur  @xcite . ] _ dynamical zeta function _",
    "@xmath67  @xcite related to the generating function @xmath66 by @xmath68 . the dynamical zeta function is defined as follows  @xcite : @xmath69 the topological entropy @xmath70 is : @xmath71 if the dynamical zeta function is _ rational _ , @xmath72 will be the inverse of the pole of smallest modulus of @xmath73 or @xmath74 . if the dynamical zeta function can be interpreted as the ratio of two characteristic polynomials of two linear operators and @xmath75 . ]",
    "@xmath76 and @xmath75 , namely @xmath77 , then the number of fixed points @xmath78 can be expressed from @xmath79 . in this case , the poles of a rational dynamical zeta function are related to the ( inverse of the zeroes of the ) characteristic polynomial of the linear operator @xmath80 only . since the number of fixed points remains unchanged under _ topological conjugacy _",
    "( see smale @xcite for this notion ) , the dynamical zeta function is also a _ topologically invariant function _ , invariant under a large set of transformations , and does not depend on a specific choice of variables .",
    "such invariances were also noticed for the growth complexity @xmath18 .",
    "it is thus tempting to make a connection between the _ rationality _ of the complexity generating function previously given , and a possible _ rationality _ of the dynamical zeta function .",
    "we will also compare the singularities of these two sets of generating functions , namely the growth complexity @xmath18 and @xmath81 , the ( exponential of the ) topological entropy .",
    ".1 cm * some results for the dynamical zeta function :* let us now get the expansion of the dynamical zeta function of the mapping @xmath82 , for generic values of @xmath34 .",
    "we can first concentrate on the specific , close to the 1/2 value where the mapping is integrable  @xcite , namely @xmath83 , has been analyzed in some detail in  @xcite .",
    "for this value @xmath84 , the enumeration of the number of fixed points , @xmath22-cycles and the actual status of these fixed points ( elliptic , hyperbolic , points ... ) are given in  @xcite .",
    "] , but arbitrary , value @xmath85 . of course",
    ", there is nothing particular with this specific @xmath86 value : the same calculations have been performed for many other _",
    "generic _ values of @xmath87 yielding the same number of ( complex ) fixed points and , thus , the same dynamical zeta function .",
    "the total number of fixed points of @xmath88 , for @xmath89 running from @xmath90 to @xmath91 , yields , up to order fourteen , the following expansion for the generating function @xmath66 of the number of fixed points : @xmath92 this expansion coincides with the one of the _ rational _ function , up to some algebraic values of @xmath30 corresponding to cycle - fusion mechanism see ( [ previous ] ) and ( [ moreprevious ] ) below and see  @xcite . ] : @xmath93 which corresponds to a very _ simple ) , a clipped bernoulli shift with the `` pruning rule '' to forbid substring @xmath94 ( that is 1 must be always followed by 0 ) in any sequence of 0 and 1 . however , constructing the markovian partitions ( if any ) , yielding this simple pruning rule for the symbolic dynamics , remains to be done . ]",
    "rational _ expression for the dynamical zeta function : @xmath95 an alternative way of writing the dynamical zeta functions relies on the decomposition of the fixed points into _ irreducible cycles _ : @xmath96 for generic values of @xmath34 , one gets the following numbers of irreducible cycles : @xmath97@xmath98 it has been conjectured in  @xcite that _ the simple rational expression _  ( [ conjec ] ) _ is the actual expression of the dynamical zeta function for any generic value of @xmath34 _ ( up to some algebraic values of @xmath12 , see below and in section ( [ creal ] ) ) .",
    "similar calculations have been performed for the other values of @xmath99 that have been singled out in the semi - numerical analysis  @xcite . for the non generic values of @xmath34 , @xmath100 with @xmath101 , we have obtained expansions compatible with the following _ rational _ expression : @xmath102 for the other non generic values , namely @xmath103 with @xmath104 odd , the expansions are not large enough to conjecture a single formula valid for any @xmath40 . for @xmath105 ( namely @xmath106 )",
    "one actually gets a dynamical zeta function given by ( [ zetamtexte ] ) for @xmath107 and this might also be the case for @xmath108 . for @xmath109",
    "the expansions are in agreement with a @xmath110 singularity . comparing the various rational expressions in  ( [ firsteq ] ) corresponding to generic , and non - generic , values of @xmath12 , with ( [ conjec ] ) , and ( [ zetamtexte ] ) , respectively",
    ", one sees that the singularities ( poles ) of the dynamical zeta function happen to _ coincide _ with the poles of the generating functions of the growth complexity @xmath4 , for all the values of @xmath34 .",
    "in particular , the growth complexity @xmath111 and @xmath81 , the exponential of the topological entropy , are always _",
    "equal_.    let us just mention , here , that the modification of the number of fixed points , from the `` generic '' values of @xmath28 to the particular values ( @xmath112 , @xmath113 ) , corresponds to the _ disappearance of some cycles _ which become singular points ( indetermination of the form @xmath114 ) .",
    "these mechanisms will be detailed in  @xcite .",
    "actually the `` non - generic '' values of @xmath115 , like @xmath116 , correspond to such a `` disappearance of cycles '' mechanism which modifies the denominator of the rational generating functions , and , thus , the topological entropy and the growth complexity @xmath18 .",
    "in contrast , there actually exists for @xmath117 , _ other singled - out values _ of @xmath115 , like @xmath118 for instance , which correspond to _ fusion of cycles _ ( see section ( [ creal ] ) ) : in the @xmath119 limit , the order three cycle tends to coincide with the order one cycle , which amounts to multiplying the dynamical zeta function ( [ conjec ] ) by @xmath120 .",
    "such `` fusion - cycle '' mechanism _ does not modify _ the denominator of the rational functions , and thus , the topological entropy , or the growth complexity @xmath4 , _ remain unchanged_.    * to sum up :* considering a ( very simple ) one parameter - dependent birational mapping of _ only two ( complex ) variables _ , we have deduced an exact identification between the ( asymptotic of the ) arnold complexity , that is the growth complexity @xmath19 , and the ( exponential of the ) topological entropy for _ all _ the various @xmath12 cases ( generic or not ) .",
    "this identification can be understood heuristically  @xcite . as a byproduct",
    ", one finds that these two complexities correspond , in this very example , to _ simple algebraic numbers_.    .3 cm * a canonical degree generating function :* this identification result is not completely surprising : the dynamical zeta function is a quite `` universal '' function , invariant under a large set of _ topological conjugaisons _  @xcite , and the concept of arnold complexity ( or the degree growth complexity @xmath4 ) also has the same `` large '' set of ( topological and projective ) invariances  @xcite .",
    "actually , as far as degree generating functions are concerned , it is natural to introduce , instead of some generating functions of the degrees of the numerator of the @xmath45 component of the @xmath1-th iterate , a more `` canonical '' degree generating function @xmath121 associated with the birational mapping ( [ yz ] ) written in a _ homogeneous way _ ( see the bi - polynomial mapping ( 4 ) in  @xcite ) .",
    "iterating ( [ yz ] ) , written in a homogeneous way , and , factoring out at each iteration step the gcd s , one gets a new degree generating function @xmath121 well - suited , at first sight , to describe such large ( topological and projective ) invariances .",
    "a simple calculation shows that this ( projectively well - suited ) degree generating function reads ( for generic @xmath12 ) : @xmath122 for the @xmath123 particular values , and for the two integrable values , @xmath124 and @xmath125 , one gets respectively : @xmath126 since the expansions for the infinite set of values of the form @xmath127 for @xmath128 , can only be performed up to order eleven ( or twelve ) , it is difficult to `` guess '' any expression valid for any @xmath129 like ( [ 1surmhom ] ) .",
    "recalling the results ( [ firsteq ] ) given in section ( [ generdegree ] ) for the degree growth generating functions , one may suspect that , among these @xmath127 for @xmath128 values , one should make a distinction between @xmath130 on one side , and @xmath131 on the other side .",
    "in fact , up to order eleven , all our calculations for various @xmath127 values for @xmath128 ( @xmath132 ) are in agreement with a general equality between @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "more details are available in appendix  a.    one gets simpler expressions for the integrable values @xmath135 and @xmath136 : @xmath137 one remarks that @xmath121 verifies the simple functional equation @xmath138 , for @xmath139 , and @xmath140 for @xmath141 .    for @xmath142",
    "we have not written any dynamical zeta function @xmath143 because , for such an integrable birational mapping , there exist , at ( almost ) any order @xmath144 of iteration , an _ infinite number _ of fixed points of order @xmath144 ( all the points of some elliptic curves  @xcite ) and , therefore , our previous `` simple '' definition ( [ zeta ] ) for the dynamical zeta function is not valid anymore .",
    ".3 cm .1 cm * a possible universal relation .",
    "* one can imagine many simple relations between the `` canonical '' degree generating function , @xmath145 , and the dynamical zeta function , @xmath146 .",
    "for instance , for generic @xmath30 , one gets ( among many ... ) the relation @xmath147 , however this relation is not anymore valid for @xmath116 .",
    "one would like to find a `` true universal '' relation between @xmath148 and @xmath149 , that is a relation _ independent _ of @xmath17 ( generic or non - generic ) .",
    "in order to achieve this goal one may imagine to barter @xmath150 , and @xmath149 , for _ projectively well - suited generating functions _ taking into account the point at @xmath151 , namely a dynamical zeta function taking into account the fixed point at @xmath152 ( see ( 52 ) in  @xcite ) , @xmath153 , and @xmath154 defined as follows : @xmath155 one verifies immediately that the relation : @xmath156 is _ actually verified for generic _ values of @xmath12 , as well as , for the _ non - generic values _ of the form @xmath157 , and also some _ non - generic values _ of the form @xmath158 ( see appendix  a ) .",
    "a similar relation for the two - parameters family of birational transformations depicted in  @xcite will be detailed elsewhere .",

    "as far as the growth complexity @xmath25 is concerned , the generic values of @xmath28 ( that is the values different from the previous @xmath112 , @xmath113 singled - out values ) are all on the same `` complexity footing '' ( see the previous fig.[f : fig1 ] ) .",

    "for most of the phase portraits below around 300 orbits of length 1000 , starting from randomly chosen points inside the frame , have been generated ( only points inside the frame are shown ) :    on these various phase portraits one sees that one gets , near the integrable value @xmath175 , quite different phase portraits which seem , however , to have roughly the same number of ( real ) fixed points ( see fig.[f : fig4 ] and fig.[f : fig5 ] ) . on these various phase portraits",

    "these results will be revisited in a forthcoming section ( see section ( [ rac ] ) ) .",
