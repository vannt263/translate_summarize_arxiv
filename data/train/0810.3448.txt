    "kamland(**kam**ioka * * l**iquid scintillator * * a**nti-**n**eutrino * * d**etector ) investigates neutrino oscillation parameters by observing electron anti - neutrinos ( @xmath16 ) from distant nuclear reactors .",
    "previously , kamland reported the first evidence of @xmath16 disappearance  @xcite and evidence of spectral distortion of the reactor @xmath16 energy spectrum  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , kamland published the first investigation of geologically produced anti - neutrinos ( geo - neutrinos ) from radioactive decay in the earth@xcite .    in our recent analysis",
    "@xcite , we have enlarged the fiducial volume radius from 5.5 m to 6.0 m , extended the analysis threshold down to the inverse-@xmath1 decay energy threshold and reduced the systematic uncertainties in the number of target protons and the background .",
    "@xmath16 are detected via the inverse @xmath1 decay reaction , @xmath0 + p @xmath17 n + e@xmath18 .",
    "the emitted positron annihilates with an electron and emits two 0.511mev @xmath19-rays .",
    "this signal appears as a prompt signal and its energy consist of the positron kinetic energy and these two @xmath19-rays .",
    "the prompt scintillation light from the e@xmath18 gives a measure of the @xmath16 energy , @xmath20 + 0.8mev , where @xmath21 is the average neutron recoil energy , o(10kev ) .",
    "the neutron thermalizes by elastic scattering in the liquid scintillator and captures on a proton after 207.5 @xmath6 2.8@xmath22sec , creating a deuteron with 2.2mev @xmath19 emission .",
    "the neutron capture is the delayed signal . by using the delayed coincidence method , the backgrounds that do not have timing or space correlations",
    "are significantly reduced .",
    "we recently used an off - axis calibration system to investigate the vertex position reconstruction performance .",
    "up to 5.5 m radius , the vertex reconstruction deviation is within 3 cm at any ( r , @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) , corresponding to 1.6@xmath25 fiducial volume uncertainty .",
    "@xmath26b/@xmath26n spallation products are used to extrapolate this uncertainty up to 6.0 m fiducial radius , resulting in 1.8@xmath25 uncertainty .",
    "the vertex and energy resolution are also estimated from off - axis and z - axis calibration data .",
    "the estimated vertex resolution is @xmath27 12cm/@xmath28 and the energy resolution is 6.5@xmath25/@xmath28 .      in ref.@xcite ,",
    "5.5 m fiducial radius and 2.6mev prompt energy threshold were applied to the reactor @xmath16 analysis . to get more statistics and to use the full reactor energy spectrum , a larger fiducial volume and a lower energy threshold",
    "are required .",
    "however , accidental coincidences due to @xmath29k , @xmath30bi and @xmath31tl increase near the balloon surface ( r = 6.5 m ) reducing the signal - noise ratio . to maintain high efficiency for @xmath16 detection",
    ", we apply a likelihood selection using event characteristics .",
    "firstly we construct a probability density function ( pdf ) for accidental coincidence events , @xmath32 by using an off - time ( 10ms to 20 sec ) window .",
    "a pdf for the @xmath16 , @xmath33 is constructed from a mc simulation . for the @xmath34 distribution ,",
    "we select an no - oscillation reactor spectrum including a contribution from geo - neutrinos . a discriminator value",
    ", @xmath35 is calculated for all candidate pairs that pass the primary cuts .",
    "we choose a selection value @xmath36 in @xmath37 bins of 0.1 mev , where @xmath36 is the value which has the maximum figure - of - merit .",
    "table [ tbl : uncertainty ] shows the summary of the systematic uncertainties in the analysis .",
    "the dominant uncertainties come from the reactor - related ones .    .estimated systematic uncertainties relevant for the neutrino oscillation parameters .",

    "all histograms corresponding to reactor spectra and expected backgrounds incorporate the energy - dependent selection efficiency(top ) .",
    "the shaded background and geo - neutrino histograms are cumulative .",
    "statistical uncertainties are shown for the data .",
    "the band on the blue histogram indicates the event rate systematic uncertainty.,width=226 ]",
    "we observe 1609 events in our data - set . with no @xmath16 disappearance",
    ", we expect 2179 @xmath6 89 events from the reactors .",
    "the background in this analysis is 276.1 @xmath6 23.5 events excluding the geo - neutrino signal .",
    "figure [ fig : jacpic2-f1 ] shows the prompt energy spectrum of selected @xmath16 events and the fitted backgrounds .",
    "the unbinned data is assessed with a maximum likelihood fit to two - flavor neutrino oscillation , simultaneously fitting the geo - neutrino contribution .",
    "the method uses the absolute time of the event and accounts for time variations in the reactor flux . earth matter oscillation effects are also included .",
    "the best - fit is shown in figure [ fig : jacpic2-f1 ] .",

    "a combined oscillation analysis of kamland and other solar neutrino experiments under the assumption of cpt invariance gives @xmath2m@xmath3 = 7.59 @xmath6 0.21 @xmath8 10@xmath9 ev@xmath10 and tan@xmath11 = 0.47@xmath38 .",

    "the data and the best - fit spectrum are divided by the expected spectrum without oscillation .",
    "l@xmath39 is the flux - weighted effective baseline and is 180 km .",
    "two oscillation periods are seen , the kamland data is in excellent agreement with the oscillation scenario .    to determine the number of geo - neutrinos , we fit the normalization of the @xmath0 energy spectrum from u and th decay chains simultaneously with the neutrino oscillation parameters using the kamland and solar data . fixing the th / u mass ratio from planetary data to 3.9 ,",
    "the best - fit value is 73 @xmath6 27 events .",
    "the kamland experiment has determined a precise value for the neutrino oscillation parameter @xmath2m@xmath3 and stringent constraints on @xmath40 using reactor anti - neutrinos from 55 japanese reactors over a five years period . the observed neutrino spectrum is distorted and the significance of the spectral distortion is @xmath15 5@xmath14 and no - spectral distortion is strongly disfavored . a two - neutrino oscillation analysis of the kamland data with 0.9 mev threshold gives @xmath41 = 0.56@xmath12 ( @xmath5 ) @xmath13 ( @xmath7 ) and @xmath2m@xmath3 = 7.58 @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) @xmath60.15(@xmath7 ) @xmath8 10@xmath9 ev@xmath10 .",
