    "this high degree of tunability enables one to study bec in artificially designed structures which can not be achieved in conventional solids .",
    "for instance , the one - dimensional bichromatic potential has been realized in a system of @xmath0rb atoms  @xcite , and such a quasiperiodic potential has been studied theoretically  @xcite in the context of bec .",
    "more recently , a new method for creating potentials through a holographic mask was introduced  @xcite . using this technique",
    ", it seems feasible to experimentally generate exotic structures such as the fibonacci lattice  @xcite and the penrose tiling  @xcite which are of interest as one- and two - dimensional quasicrystals , respectively .",
    "these low - dimensional quasicrystals have attracted considerable theoretical attention since there appear fractal wavefunctions which are neither extended nor localized @xcite .",
    "they are called critical states .",
    "the rapid progress in the study of bec can set a stage for exploring these exotic states in experiments .",
    "the new ingredient that appears in the system of bec is the nonlinearity caused by interatomic interactions which can be tuned by the feshbach resonance .",
    "one might expect that fractal wavefunctions are fragile and are easily destroyed by the nonlinearity .",
    "surprisingly , this is not the case .",
    "in fact , we demonstrate that there indeed exist critical states on the fibonacci optical lattice .",
    "this is intended to stimulate experimental efforts to observe critical states in a cold - atom setup .    in order to describe a bose - einstein condensate on the fibonacci optical lattice ,",

    "more precisely , the spectrum is singular continuous  @xcite and called the cantor spectrum . in order to elucidate the effect of nonlinearity on the critical states",
    ", we numerically solve the stationary nonlinear schrdinger equation . as mentioned above , our numerical results show that the critical states persist despite the presence of the nonlinearity in the sea of stationary solitons  @xcite . with the aid of mathematical tools , we show that for any critical state , the  eigenenergy \" must be included in the cantor spectrum of the schrdinger equation without nonlinearity .",

    "the oscillation in fig .",
    "[ fig : fa ] can be explained as the effect of the dirichlet boundary condition as follows : we treat only the case of the linear schrdinger equation , i.e. , with @xmath54 .",

    "the contribution of the second term is written @xmath73 with @xmath74 , where we have assumed @xmath75 with some @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , we naively expect that the number of the site @xmath44 satisfying @xmath77 is given by @xmath78 however , the behavior in the second case is questionable .",
    "clearly , from ( [ 2ndbehav ] ) , the second case occurs for large @xmath79 . further , if @xmath80 , then one has @xmath81 .",
    "in such a case , the second term in the right - hand side of ( [ phidef ] ) does not contribute to @xmath67 although @xmath82 .",

    "to summarize , we obtain @xmath86 this explains the oscillation of @xmath52 on the right side of the profile in fig .",
    "[ fig : fa ] .",

    "we prove three theorems for the nonlinear schrdinger equation : theorem  [ thm : forbidden ] states that there exists a forbidden region for two parameters , energy and nonlinearity , such that the nonlinear schrdinger equation   with the periodic boundary condition has no solution . in the infinite - length limit",

    ", we can also numerically determine the internal energy .",
    "the method presented in this paper equally applies to a higher dimensional model in which the on - site potential in each direction is arranged by a generic quasiperiodic rule such as the fibonacci rule . actually , the eigenstates for the corresponding linear schrdinger equation have a product form of the one - dimensional eigenstates .",
    "( see , for example , @xcite . )",
    "this implies that , in order to detect critical states or fractal wavefunctions on bec , experimentalists do not necessarily need to stick to a one - dimensional system .",
    "also our method is applicable to a wide class of nonlinear schrdinger equations for studying the properties of stationary states .",
    "for example , we can treat bichromatic on - site potentials  @xcite which is considered as the harper equation  @xcite , two different hopping integrals arranged in the fibonacci sequence  @xcite , and different types of nonlinearities such as the ablowitz - ladik one  @xcite .",

    "this work was supported by grant - in - aid for research activity start - up ( 23840034 ) and grant - in - aid for young scientists ( b ) ( 23740298 ) .",
    "although theorem  [ thm : random ] below holds for a wide class of nonlinear schrdinger equations which have a localization regime in the spectrum of the corresponding linear schrdinger equation , we consider a random nonlinear schrdinger equation in one dimension as a concrete example .",
    "the nonlinear schrdinger equation is given by replacing the on - site fibonacci potential with a random potential in .",
    "as is well known , all the eigenstates in the corresponding linear system are localized for a general class of randomness in one dimension . as to the nonlinear eigenvalue problem , a certain set of localized eigenstates is proved to exist for more general setting  @xcite .",
    "see also a related article  @xcite .    in the following , we will prove that there is no stationary solution of the nonlinear schrdinger equation such that the solution exhibits conventional properties of critical or extended states .",
    "unfortunately , we can not exclude the existence of certain pathological states which are not localized .",
    "we believe that such pathological states can not appear for standard systems .",
    "thus , the localization of the stationary states are expected to survive switching on the nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "clearly , our result is consistent with the previous results@xcite .",
    "let @xmath197 be a sequence of finite lattices satisfying @xmath198 let @xmath131 be a stationary solution of the nonlinear schrdinger equation on the lattice @xmath199 with the eigenenergy @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is the number of the sites in @xmath199 .",
    "we choose the sequence @xmath197 so that the eigenenergy @xmath132 converges to some value @xmath200 in the infinite - volume limit @xmath201 .",
    "set @xmath202 for the wavefunction @xmath137 , we introduce the following two conditions : @xmath203 and there exists a finite lattice @xmath204 such that @xmath205 the former condition ( [ 1con ] ) implies that the wavefunction @xmath137 is not localized , and it does not split into two portions , a localized part and the rest , such that the distance between two portions becomes infinity in the infinite - volume limit .",
    "in fact , if @xmath206 then @xmath207 converges to a localized state in the infinite - volume limit even for a critical or extended state @xmath208 .",
    "the latter condition ( [ 2con ] ) implies that the wavefunction @xmath207 does not disappear from finite regions .",
    "we also consider the corresponding linear schrdinger equation , and write @xmath209 for the hamiltonian .",
    "the statement is given in a generic form as follows :    let @xmath137 be a stationary solution of the nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "suppose that the eigenenergy @xmath200 in the infinite - volume limit is an interior point of the localization regime in the energy spectrum of the corresponding linear schrdinger equation .",
    "then the solution @xmath137 can not simultaneously satisfy the above two conditions ( [ 1con ] ) and ( [ 2con ] ) .",
    "in other words , if a stationary solution is purely critical or extended in the sense of ( [ 1con ] ) and satisfies the energy condition , then its dominant part in the sense of the absolute value of the wavefunction can not appear in any finite region .",
    "[ thm : random ]    assume that @xmath137 satisfies the conditions ( [ 1con ] ) and ( [ 2con ] ) . from this assumption , we will show that one can construct an extended or a critical state for the corresponding linear schrdinger equation in the infinite - volume limit .    from ( [ 2con ] ) ,",
    "there exist a subsequence @xmath210 of @xmath197 and a site @xmath211 such that @xmath212 converges to some nonzero value @xmath213 as @xmath214 .",
    "therefore , we can obtain a wavefunction @xmath215 in the infinite - volume limit by using the diagonal trick around the site @xmath216 .",
    "clearly , the wavefunction @xmath215 is nonvanishing , and non - normalizable from the condition ( [ 1con ] ) .    in the same way as in",
    ", we define by @xmath217 the hamiltonian with the additional potential @xmath218 which is determined by @xmath219 .",
    "then , we have @xmath220 .    from these",
    ", we have @xmath221 where @xmath222 is a subsequence of @xmath223 , and @xmath224 is a function which converges to a rapidly decreasing function @xmath225 in the limit @xmath226 , and @xmath227 is the hamiltonian of the linear schrdinger equation in the infinite - volume limit .",
    "this result implies that @xmath215 is a generalized eigenvector of @xmath227 .",
    "since @xmath215 is non - normalizable , this contradicts with the assumption that @xmath103 is an interior point of the localization regime .",
    "the result ( [ eigenvalueeqa ] ) implies that the vector @xmath228 locally satisfies the linear schrdinger equation as @xmath229    if there exists a localization regime in the corresponding linear schrdineger equation , then the statement of theorem  [ thm : random ] generally holds .",
    "for example , the harper model has a localization regime for certain values of the coupling constant of the quasiperiodic potential .",
    "therefore , there is no stationary solution which is a conventional critical or extended state by switching on nonlinearity under the condition that the nonlinear potential @xmath218 vanishes in the infinite - volume limit . as a result",
    ", we can expect that the localization of the stationary states in the model is not destroyed by nonlinearity .    finally , we remark the following : localization of stationary states may not lead to dynamical localization for nonlinear systems .",
    "( for related articles , see @xcite . )",
    "however , the existence  @xcite of stationary localized states implies that , if nonlinearity dynamically destroys localization in a linear system , whether a wavefunction is dynamically localized or not strongly depends on the initial wavefunction .",
    "actually , if an eigenstate is localized as a stationary solution of the nonlinear schrdinger equation , then the time evolution of the state is localized , too ."
