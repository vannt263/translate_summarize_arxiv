    "in order to estimate the anthropogenic impact on climate in the future , the response of the climate system to the present perturbation by greenhouse gases needs to be quantified .",
    "a frequently used measure for the response to changes in atmospheric co@xmath0-concentration is the equilibrium climate sensitivity ( ecs ) .",
    "this is defined as the increase in global mean surface temperature per radiative forcing change after the fast - acting feedback processes in the earth system have come into equilibrium @xcite - doubling , i.e. in units of k , while the equilibrium climate sensitivity parameter describes the warming per radiative forcing , i.e. in units of k  ( w  m@xmath1)@xmath2 .",
    "here we use the term ecs for both quantities and mostly use the units of warming per radiative forcing . ] .",
    "frequently it is estimated by climate model simulations , where the atmospheric co@xmath0-concentration is doubled within a few decades , and equilibrium is assumed after typically 100 - 200 years ; slow climate processes are kept stationary ( and non - dynamic ) in these model simulations .",
    "ecs is the benchmark quantity for climate models but is still characterised by a considerable uncertainty of 1.5  4.5  k per co@xmath0-doubling @xcite and neither recent observations have narrowed down the range of expected climate change @xcite .",
    "it is also clear that the feedbacks , and hence the ecs will depend on climate state , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "palaeoclimate studies have tried to use proxy records to independently constrain ecs @xcite , but even by taking account of fast feedback processes that depend on the climate state @xcite it remains difficult to further constrain the range of expected climate warming . in particular , large temperature changes as a consequence of atmospheric co@xmath0  increase can not be excluded .",
    "the observed warming of the earth involves both direct radiative forcing and a variety of ( positive and negative ) fast feedback mechanisms .",
    "these are mostly related to atmospheric water vapour content , sea - ice and cloud albedo and aerosol concentrations . on the slower ( decadal )",
    "time scales ocean heat uptake also contributes to the radiative ( im-)balance . quantifying the ( fast ) forcing is therefore not an easy task and limits our ability to reduce the uncertainty on climate sensitivity @xcite .",
    "more generally , the internal variability of the climate system on many time scales leads to a large uncertainty of the ecs .",
    "in fact , the most appropriate definition of ecs in the presence of natural variability and forcing is still under debate .",
    "ghil and co - workers propose a non - autonomous stochastic approach in terms of random dynamical systems @xcite , and suggesting that climate sensitivity corresponds to a derivative of a metric ( wasserstein distance ) evaluated for the invariant measure with respect to some parameter that is changed .",
    "other approaches include considering perturbations that are not necessarily in the linear regime : @xcite use a conditional nonlinear optimization approach to define climate sensitivity .    in this paper",
    "we discuss climate sensitivity as a property of the climate dynamics projected into the space of forcing @xmath3 to global mean temperature @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , section  [ sec : ecs ] discusses ecs for the unperturbed system with slow variability in terms of pairs of points on or near the `` climate attractor '' .",
    "we relate this to more usual concepts of ecs and use this as a way to discuss state dependence . in particular we discuss `` climate regimes '' such that the sensitivity is well constrained within a regime , but poorly constrained whilst switching between regimes .",
    "we also discuss possible perturbations and differentiate those that give return to the same climate attractor from those that do not . in section [",
    "s : model ] we explore these ideas using a specific conceptual model of the earth system @xcite , that includes dynamic co@xmath0  and is able to simulate glacial - interglacial cycles as relaxation oscillations . in this section the model",
    "is also perturbed in various ways to obtain ( state - dependent ) distributions of climate sensitivity .",
    "we conclude in section [ s : concl ] with a discussion of some issues that arise related to the extraction and interpretation of ecs distributions from palaeoclimate records .",
    "the usual approach to ecs is to consider the radiative energy balance for the global mean surface temperature @xmath4 @xmath6 where @xmath7 we understand as the radiation due to ( external ) forcings , e.g. the radiation received from the sun @xmath8 and the forcing @xmath9 due to the greenhouse effect of atmospheric co@xmath0 .",
    "the fluxes @xmath10 and @xmath11 are contributions to the radiative balance due to a set of feedback processes in the climate system that are classified as slow and fast , respectively , usually relative to the typical time scale of the forcing . finally , @xmath12 is the outgoing longwave radiation determined by the stefan - boltzmann law ( with @xmath13 the stefan - boltzmann constant and @xmath14 the emissivity of the atmosphere ) .",
    "the equation ( [ e : energybalance ] ) suggests a simple @xmath5 relationship but in reality it is hard to unpick this relationship , not least because fast feedbacks may potentially give multiple attractors when the slow feedbacks are fixed .    here",
    ", we simply take the approach that @xmath4 and @xmath3 are quantities that one can ( in principle ) observe from a complex system and we investigate the relationship between them . given two climate states with forcings @xmath15 and @xmath16 and temperatures @xmath17 and @xmath18 , we consider climate sensitivity as the ratio of temperature change to radiative forcing change ( including slow feedbacks ) : s = = .",
    "[ e : sspecific ] if there is a functional relationship of the form @xmath19 for @xmath20 then in the limit of small differences in @xmath3 we expect s [ e : sslope ] in the ( hypothetical ) case that all slow processes are known and quantified and that a time - scale separation between slow and fast processes exists , @xmath21 is the usual ecs .",
    "however , we take the approach that ( [ e : sspecific ] ) can still be studied when no functional relation @xmath22 exists , and this naturally leads to distributions of ecs .",

    "moreover , on the one hand @xmath25 should be small to make a linear approximation valid .",

    "in other words , for any ( measurable ) @xmath40 we can use @xmath33 to assign a probability to the sensitivity being in @xmath41 : ( s_[co_2,li]a):=(\\ { ( t_1,r_[co_2,li],1),(t_2,r_[co_2,li],2 )  :  s_[co_2,li ] a } ) .",
    "[ e : sdist ] note that ( [ e : sdelta ] ) can be determined from a time series that does not necessarily explore the full attractor , while ( [ e : sdist ] ) considers states purely depending on the locations in the @xmath5 plane . in section 3 , we give an example showing that the approaches ( [ e : sdelta ] ) and ( [ e : sdist ] ) can give similar distributions when considering a wide range of @xmath28 and initial points .      a study of palaeoclimate records , for example the ice age cycles of the last 800 kyr , shows the presence of markedly different `` regimes '' of climate , namely periods of slowly varying climate and rapid transitions between these regimes ( the deglaciations ) .",
    "we wish to evaluate the sensitivities associated within one regime , and associated with changing regimes . for definiteness , we only consider climates with two regimes - a cold ( @xmath42 ) and a warm ( @xmath43 ) regime - in this paper .",
    "if one partitions the attractor into two regimes in state space , this implies a partition of @xmath33 into two distributions @xmath44 evaluating the distribution of climate sensitivities corresponding to choosing typical endpoints relative to these distributions allows one to examine the sensitivities within regimes . in particular one can define conditional distributions of sensitivities of the `` warm '' ( and similarly the `` cold '' ) states by ( s^ww_[co_2,li]a):=_w_w(\\ { ( t_1,r_[co_2,li],1),(t_2,r_[co_2,li],2 )  :  s_[co_2,li ] a } ) [ e : sww ] where @xmath26}$ ] is as in ( [ e : sapprox ] )",

    "for an optimal choice of regimes one would aim to ensure that the distribution of sensitivities within each regime is tightly localised , while those associated with regime changes may be poorly localised .",
    "a regime could , therefore , be defined as a region in @xmath5 space where the @xmath22 relation is almost linear .",
    "we now consider response to two types of instantaneous perturbation .",
    "the first type of perturbation does not structurally change the system or leave the basin of the current attractor : the response shows transient decay back to the attractor followed by continued motion on the same attractor .",
    "the response to such a perturbation includes the possibility of switching between regimes of the attractor , depending on the initial point on the attractor where the perturbation is applied .",
    "figure  [ f : schematictr]b illustrates this schematically .",
    "in such a case , the distribution of sensitivities will potentially depend on the timescale @xmath28 of interest and the initial time @xmath30 .",
    "however we expect it to decay to the ( regime dependent ) sensitivity for large @xmath28 .    the second type of perturbation either structurally changes the system attractor , or is large enough to place the state in the basin of a different attractor . in either case",
    "the response will approach a new attractor as illustrated in figure  [ f : schematictr]d . in this case",
    "the distribution of sensitivities obtained by comparing initial and final states may not resemble regimes of either attractor .",
    "finally , we mention another approach to perturbation that is particularly useful for short - term prediction : figure  [ f : schematictr]c starts with a localised ( say gaussian ) distribution @xmath52 centred on a perturbed reference state at some time @xmath30 , and propagate this forwards to time @xmath31 for some @xmath53 .",
    "the initial distribution will spread to give a localised measure @xmath54 that gives a distribution of possible sensitivities via ( [ e : sapprox ] ) , which again may depend on the timescale @xmath28 , which again may depend on the timescale @xmath28 .",
    "ecs derived from palaeoclimate records typically reflects the climate sensitivity on the attractor ( fig .",
    "[ f : schematictr]a ) , while model - determined ecs usually involves some type of perturbation ( away from the attractor ) . in this sense ,",
    "palaeo ecs and model ecs are conceptually different . in the next section ,",
    "we explore how and when these two concepts can still give similar disributions , using a conceptual earth system model .",
    "the conceptual model of the climate system of @xcite has been shown to simulate the glacial - interglacial transitions ; the model equations are given in appendix  [ ap : model ] . in this model ,",
    "the atmosphere is represented by 4 meridional boxes while the ocean component consists of two layers of 4 meridional boxes each .",
    "the model includes land ice , sea ice and carbon - cycle effects , such that the atmospheric co@xmath0  concentration is a dynamic variable in the model .",
    "the model contains one dynamic fast feedback , namely the sea ice - albedo feedback evolving on ( sub-)decadal time scales , and one slow feedback , the land ice - albedo feedback , which evolves on the order of millennial time scales . on the decade - to - century time scale the model includes an additional process in the surface radiative balance due to heat exchange between ocean and atmosphere .",
    "all other fast feedbacks ( water vapor , clouds , aerosols , lapse rate ) are represented by a fixed temperature response to the radiative forcing in the system . in this case , as discussed in appendix  [ ap : cs ] there is only one active slow feedback process , and the specific climate sensitivity parameter @xmath26}$ ] ( [ e : sapprox ] ) represents the model s ecs .",
    "orbital forcing is included in the model through varying incoming solar radiation averaged over each atmospheric box on seasonal and orbital time scales and modulating the northern hemisphere land ice ablation term by the ( northern polar box averaged ) summer insolation on orbital time scales @xcite .",
    "the atmospheric co@xmath0-concentration in the full model system deserves further discussion because it can be viewed as both a forcing and a feedback .",
    "while the dynamic co@xmath0  is not essential for generating the glacial - interglacial cycles in the model , it feeds back on their amplitude ; during cold periods when land ice is growing , reduced vertical mixing in the southern ocean and extended southern ocean sea ice cover leads to reduced atmospheric co@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the exchange of co@xmath0  between ocean and atmosphere is fast ( on time scales of a decade ) , however , the vertical mixing of surface - to - deep water masses in the southern ocean is affected by the temperature of the north atlantic deep water , which evolves on slower time scales .",
    "the associated feedback process therefore acts on various time scales .",
    "when determining climate sensitivity , co@xmath0  is generally assumed a forcing . here",
    ", it is important to keep in mind that it also can be viewed as a feedback as has been observed also in other models @xcite and will be the case in the real climate system , particularly on long ( geological ) timescales .",
    "we first analyse a simulation with the climate model including prognostic @xmath55 and milankovitch forcing .",
    "the simulation is started 500 kyr ago from initial conditions that are assumed to be close to the attractor and it is run up until the present day .",
    "the simulated glacial - interglacial cycles show a peak - to - peak global mean temperature difference of up to 4  k ( fig .",
    "[ f : glacialcycles]a ) .",
    "corresponding co@xmath0 differences are about 75 ppmv , which here are completely generated by the effect of the solubility pump in the ocean",
    ".    in this model the fast sea ice - albedo feedback is responsible for the abrupt glacial - interglacial variations  the so - called sea ice switch mechanism as suggested by @xcite .",
    "the sea ice switch mechanism generates the glacial cycles in the model as self sustained relaxation oscillations because the ice volume thresholds for switching sea ice cover ` on ' and ` off ' differ @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ f : glacialcycles_p]a ) and we use this to define two climate regimes , a cold @xmath42 regime with extensive sea ice cover and a warm @xmath43 regime without sea ice .",
    "when the land ice volume slowly grows ( accumulation exceeds ablation ) , the atmospheric and surface ocean temperature decrease due to increasing albedo of the planet .",
    "once the polar surface ocean temperature has reached a critical value cold enough to form sea ice , the polar box is rapidly covered with sea ice , which further reduces the atmospheric temperature through the ice - albedo feedback and prevents evaporation from the polar ocean box ( fig .",
    "[ f : glacialcycles]b ) . in addition",
    ", atmospheric moisture content is reduced due to lower temperatures , which leads to decreasing land ice volume ( accumulation is smaller than ablation , fig .  [",
    "f : glacialcycles]c ) .",
    "temperature starts rising again both due to smaller albedo and because the ocean warms below the insulating sea - ice cover until it is warm enough to melt the polar sea ice , fig .",
    "[ f : glacialcycles]d ) . at this point",
    "there is a change in regime : the global temperature quickly rises , moisture content in the atmosphere increases and the land ice starts growing again ( accumulation becomes larger than ablation ) .    in this model ,",
    "milankovitch forcing is not necessary to generate the glacial - interglacial cycles , but it modifies them and makes them more irregular .",
    "although there is some degree of synchronisation of the glaciation and deglaciations to the orbital forcing , the relation between land ice and global mean solar radiation is not trivial ( fig .",
    "[ f : glacialcycles_p]b ) .",
    "milankovitch forcing mainly modulates the ( otherwise constant ) ablation of the northern hemisphere land ice , and therefore , while the land ice is growing and ocean temperatures decreasing in some ( slightly warmer ) periods , land ice accumulation becomes smaller than ablation and the ice growth and ocean cooling is reversed for a while ( fig .",
    "[ f : glacialcycles]c ) .",
    "if one tries to determine climate sensitivity from past climate records , there is only one temporal realisation of a trajectory on the climate attractor that can be measured : perturbations away from the attractor can not be performed .",
    "defining the climate sensitivity in terms of the measure on the climate attractor ( see fig .",

    "this empirical distribution can be seen as an approximation of @xmath33 in ( [ e : freqtvsr ] ) .    in the special case of this relation being",
    "a linear function @xmath22 , the climate sensitivity is given by the slope of this line and constant for all climate states .",
    "however , it has been previously shown that in this climate model the climate sensitivity is strongly state dependent due to the fast sea - ice albedo feedback changing in strength between different climate states @xcite , which allows the definition of a local climate sensitivity ( for a reference climate state ) . indeed , in fig .",
    "[ f : localdensity]b there appear to be regimes where the @xmath5 relation is close to a ( linear ) function , but particularly in the transition region from glacial to interglacial states the sensitivity is less well defined or even negative .    from this data",

    "however , the initial conditions within the @xmath42 regime involve a regime shift and do not return to the same temperature and co@xmath0-level within 500 years .",

[ f:2xcpert_time]e ; here the different behaviour of the @xmath42 and @xmath43 states becomes particularly evident : while the response to the perturbation of the @xmath43 states ( red lines ) seem to approach an equilibrium value with some spread , increasing in time , the @xmath42 states ( blue lines ) produce a wide range of responses depending on where the attractor is met after the perturbation .",
    "snapshots of distributions of @xmath79 are shown in fig .",

    "is in fact never observed , because the perturbation always induces a @xmath82 transition .",
    "in this paper , we have considered climate sensitivity as a local property of a climate attractor , in particular it is a property of a projection of a measure of this attractor on the @xmath5 plane .",
    "this naturally leads to distributions of climate sensitivity for every radiative forcing , and if the attractor shows different regimes of special climate dynamics , state dependence of climate sensitivity can be explained in terms of regimes .",
    "we have explored this in a conceptual earth system model with the aim to test how climate sensitivity derived from palaeoclimate records might be compared to model - derived counterparts .",
    "conceptually , climate sensitivity is defined differently in these two situations ; while palaeoclimate timeseries reflect trajectories on the climate attractor , in model simulations generally perturbations away from the attractor are applied .",
    "moreover , climate models include only a limited amount of processes ( usually the slower processes are fixed , as is the carbon cycle ) , which means that a different attractor may be explored by the models .",
    "clearly , we can not expect to get reliable quantitative conclusions about the distribution of ecs from the low order conceptual model used for this study .",
    "many important processes in the climate system ( such as the impact of @xmath4 on cloud formation ) are absent from the model , which was constructed in @xcite with the aim of explaining ice age pacing rather than the link between @xmath4 and co@xmath0 .",
    "even those processes that are included are open to debate ; for example , the sea ice cover changes in the model are about 1.5 times larger than suggested by proxy data @xcite , while northern hemisphere land ice cover changes are smaller ( fig .  [",
    "f : glacialcycles]b ) . moreover , the climate sensitivity derived from the model is higher during glacial periods , because the fast sea ice - albedo feedback is stronger in those regimes .",
    "proxy data suggest , however , higher climate sensitivity during warm periods @xcite , most likely because a combination of other fast feedbacks ( such as water vapour , cloud feedbacks , etc . )",
    "may be stronger during warm climates .",
    "nonetheless , even for this model , the presence of variability on a number of timescales and regimes within the attractor gives clear and we find non - trivial dependence of sensitivity on regime .",
    "this suggests that it could be useful to think of the unperturbed climate sensitivity ( which can be determined from palaeoclimate data ) as a property of the `` climate attractor '' . for a perturbed system ( we have considered",
    "instantaneously doubled co@xmath0 ) , which is the normal approach in climate models , this is still useful once an initial transient has decayed . this transient will depend in particular on ocean heat uptake , though also on carbon cycle and biosphere processes that act on time scales roughly equivalent with the forcing time scale . in the case of a regime shift ( either natural or induced by perturbation )",
    "the spread in climate sensitivity become very large .",
    "if the climate system has more than one attractor , the perturbed system may clearly evolve to a completely different set of states than the original attractor  a situation that does not occur in the climate model used here . in less extreme cases",
    ", we can not rule out very long transients ( associated with slow feedbacks ) for some perturbations .    in most climate sensitivity studies ,",
    "feedback processes are considered except those related to the carbon cycle . in the history of climate ,",
    "those processes are active , however , on many different timescales . in our conceptual model , we have included the part of the carbon cycle that is related to the soft - tissue biological pump in the oceans and air - sea co@xmath0  exchange .",
    "the resulting co@xmath0  variations in the model s glacial - interglacial cycles are in the range of the observed glacial to interglacial co@xmath0  changes and amplify the glacial - interglacial cycle while they are not necessary to generate those cycles .",
    "accordingly , when exploring climate sensitivity from perturbation experiments with the same model , we have instantaneously doubled co@xmath0  and kept the model s carbon cycle active .",
    "this procedure ensures that the perturbation experiments eventually return to the same attractor as the unperturbed system .",
    "such perturbations ( illustrated in fig .  [ f : schematictr]b , c ) are not normally applied in climate models used for climate predictions @xcite , where climate sensitivity is derived from model simulations considering prescribed , non - dynamic atmospheric co@xmath0 .    in our conceptual model , we have also examined climate sensitivities from a classical climate model perturbation ( not shown ) ; co@xmath0  is doubled within the first 30 years of the simulation and kept fixed afterwards for 200 years . in this case we find significantly lower sensitivities and smaller spread than for @xmath79 obtained from doubling co@xmath0  with dynamic co@xmath0 .",
    "this emphasises the importance of including dynamic carbon cycle processes into climate projections .",
    "moreover , it supports the idea that the real observed climate response may indeed be larger than the model predicted one , because those models never will include all feedback processes in the climate system .",
    "furthermore , the carbon cycle includes more timescales and processes than considered here in this simple model .",
    "for example , processes related to the ocean - seafloor system include carbonate compensation and silicate weathering , which act on much longer timescales and have been suggested to be responsible for a mean atmospheric lifetime of anthropogenic co@xmath0  of 30 - 35 kyr @xcite .    when deriving climate sensitivity from palaeoclimate records it is important to take account of potential state dependence and different climate regimes before drawing conclusions on the ecs distribution that may be relevant for future climate evolution . for the conceptual model we consider , the long tail in the ecs distribution from the unperturbed ( palaeoclimate ) timeseries mostly results from the cross - comparison of states within different regimes ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "similarly , the applied perturbation in the model always induced a regime transition and consequently large ecs values if the initial condition was in the @xmath42 regime , but not in the @xmath43 regime . in the context of our model , these high ecs values would not be relevant for the present climate continuing the current regime .",
    "on the other hand , if the present climate is in a regime that is susceptible to a regime shift ( either natural , or due to anthropogenic perturbation ) very large ecs values may be possible and indeed relevant . by studying data and models of warmer - than - present climates in the palaeorecord",
    "we may be able to achieve information on potentially warmer climate regimes existing for perturbed versions of the climate attractor .",
    "the ocean consists of 2 layers of 4 meridionally oriented boxes , where the polar boxes extend from 45@xmath76 to the pole and the equatorial boxes from the equator to 45@xmath76 , with meridional lengths @xmath84 the same as the atmopsheric boxes .",

    "<S> equilibrium climate sensitivity ( ecs ) is a key predictor of climate change . </S>",

    "<S> the reasons for this include strong internal variability and forcing on many time scales . in practise </S>",
    "<S> this means that the `` equilibrium '' will only be relative to fixing the _ slow _ feedback processes before comparing palaeoclimate sensitivity estimates with estimates from model simulations . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , information from the late pleistocene ice age cycles indicates that the climate cycles between cold and warm regimes , and the climate sensitivity varies considerably between regime because of _ fast _ feedback processes changing relative strength and time scales over one cycle .    in this paper we consider climate sensitivity for quite general climate dynamics . using a conceptual earth system model of gildor and tziperman ( 2001 ) ( with milankovich forcing and dynamical ocean biogeochemistry ) we explore various ways of quantifying the state - dependence of climate sensitivity from unperturbed and perturbed model time series . even without considering any perturbations , we suggest that climate sensitivity can be usefully thought of as a distribution that quantifies variability within the `` climate attractor '' and where there is a strong dependence on climate state and more specificially on the `` climate regime '' where fast processes are approximately in equilibrium </S>",
    "<S> . we also consider perturbations by instantaneous doubling of co@xmath0  and similarly find a strong dependence on the climate state using our approach . </S>"
