    "many aspects of brane physics in string compactifications have been studied in a large volume regime using geometrical methods . when the volume becomes small",
    ", however , there can be strong string corrections causing the classical description to fail .",
    "exact results are then to be based on a ` microscopic ' approach to d - branes which makes use of boundary conformal field theory .",
    "boundary conformal field theory offers powerful techniques for the construction of branes , i.e.  of their couplings to closed string modes , their open string spectra and scattering amplitudes . for the purpose of this note",
    "we shall assume that we are given the boundary conformal field theory of some brane configuration .",
    "the latter may be un- or metastable in which case our boundary conformal field theory contains relevant or marginally relevant boundary fields .",
    "such fields can generate renormalization group ( rg ) flows into new boundary conformal field theories that are associated with the stable decay product ( or bound state ) of the original brane configuration .",
    "these processes are the main subject of this note .",
    "typically , renormalization group flows are quite difficult to analyse .",
    "many models , however , possess some limit in which the end - point of the rg flow lies arbitrarily close to the starting point ( in the space of ( renormalized ) boundary couplings ) . in such cases ,",
    "the flow between the two fixed points can be studied perturbatively . for boundary conformal field theory ,",
    "the first investigations of this type were performed in @xcite .",
    "the limiting regime in which perturbative studies yield reliable results on rg flows is similar to the decoupling limit of string theory and , in general , it admits for an effective description through some non - commutative world - volume field theory as in @xcite .",
    "an illuminating example is provided by the relation between brane dynamics on group manifolds and gauge theory on a fuzzy space @xcite .",
    "strings and branes on group manifolds are analysed with the help of the wzw model .",
    "the latter is probably the most important ingredient in cft model building .",
    "hence , one may hope that a good understanding of brane dynamics on group manifolds has direct implications on other backgrounds .",
    "it is one purpose of this note to demonstrate this explicitly at the example of parafermion theories and @xmath0 minimal models .",
    "these two theories are both obtained as cosets of the su(2 ) wzw - model .    below we shall begin with a reminder on branes and brane dynamics in the group manifold su(2)@xmath1 .",
    "section 2 deals with semi - classical aspects of brane geometry in su(2 ) @xcite on which we then build our review of the decoupling limit in section 3 .",
    "after presenting the non - commutative gauge theory that describes branes on su(2 ) , we recall from @xcite that several point - like branes on su(2 ) are metastable against decay into a single spherical brane . in section 4",
    "we shall briefly discuss how such processes may be analysed beyond the decoupling limit @xcite . finally , in section 5 , we reduce the action of branes on su(2 ) to study bound state formation in parafermion theories and @xmath0 minimal models .",
    "this last section contains a number of new results .",
    "strings moving on a 3-sphere @xmath3 su(2 ) of radius @xmath4 are described by the su(2 ) wzw model at level @xmath5 .",
    "the string equations of motion imply that the 3-sphere comes equipped with a constant nsns 3-form field strength @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the volume form of the unit sphere . in the present context @xmath8",
    "is also known as the wzw 3-form .",
    "the world - sheet swept out by an open string in @xmath2 is parametrised by a map @xmath9 from the upper half - plane @xmath10 into the group manifold su(2)@xmath11 .",
    "we shall be interested in maximally symmetric d - branes on su(2 ) which are characterised by imposing the condition @xmath12 on chiral currents all along the boundary @xmath13 . with this choice of boundary conditions",
    "the theory can be solved exactly using purely algebraic methods of boundary conformal field theory . even though much of the construction was known for more than 10 years @xcite , the brane geometry encoded in rel .",
    "( [ gc ] ) was only deciphered more recently @xcite .    formally , the relation ( [ gc ] ) looks similar to dirichlet boundary conditions for branes in flat space ( note that there appears an extra minus sign in the definition of @xmath14 ) .",
    "but it turns out that this is not the correct answer . to describe the findings of @xcite we decompose the tangent space @xmath15 at each point @xmath16su(2 ) into a part @xmath17 tangential to the conjugacy class through @xmath18 and its orthogonal complement @xmath19 ( with respect to the killing form ) .",
    "it is then easy to see that eq .",
    "( [ gc ] ) implies @xmath20 in other words , the string ends can only move within the conjugacy classes on su(2 ) .",
    "except for two degenerate cases , namely the points @xmath21 and @xmath22 on the group manifold , these conjugacy classes are 2-spheres .",
    "these branes carry a non - vanishing b - field that can also be read off from eq .",
    "( [ gc ] ) .",
    "it has the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the adjoint action of @xmath25 on its lie algebra .",
    "the last two formulas hold for arbitrary groups and one can show in the general case that @xmath26 provides a 2-form potential for the wzw 3-form @xmath8 .",
    "it was argued in @xcite , @xcite that the spherical branes are stabilised by the nsns background field @xmath8 .",
    "as in the case of branes in flat space ( see @xcite and references therein ) , the presence of the b - field implies that the brane comes equipped with some bi - vector @xmath27 .",
    "the latter defines a poisson structure in the limit @xmath28 where the 3-sphere grows and approaches flat 3-space @xmath29 . , @xmath27 does not obey the jacobi identity .",
    "] it was found in @xcite that this poisson structure on @xmath29 is linear , i.e. that @xmath30 in terms of the three coordinate functions @xmath31 on the 3-dimensional flat space .",
    "recall that the moyal - weyl products that show up for brane geometry in flat space with constant b - field are obtained from the constant poisson structure @xmath32 on @xmath33 through quantisation .",
    "consequently , we expect that the quantisation of 2-spheres in @xmath29 with poisson structure ( [ lpb1 ] ) becomes relevant for the geometry of branes on @xmath34 in the limit where @xmath35 .",
    "this quantisation problem has been addressed from various angles and the solution is well known .",
    "it implies that only a discrete set of 2-spheres in @xmath29 can be quantised with their radii being related to the values of the quadratic casimir for the irreducible representations of @xmath36 .",
    "hence , the quantisable spheres are labelled by one discrete parameter @xmath37 . for each quantisable",
    "2-sphere @xmath38 one obtains a state space @xmath39 of finite dimension @xmath40 equipped with an action of the quantised coordinate functions @xmath41 on @xmath39 .",
    "the latter represent the generators @xmath42 of su(2 ) in the representation @xmath43 on @xmath39 , i.e.  @xmath44 , and they generate the matrix algebra @xmath45 which is also known as a fuzzy 2-sphere @xcite .",
    "open string amplitudes for branes on group manifold can be computed from the exact solution @xcite of the boundary wzw model .",
    "note that the knowledge of the propagator is not sufficient because we are dealing with an interacting field theory in which wick s theorem does not hold .",
    "otherwise , the computation of the effective action follows the same steps as in @xcite with two important changes : first , as we argued above , the moyal - weyl products are to be replaced by matrix products .",
    "the size of the matrices corresponds to the radius of the brane that we want to describe .",
    "moreover , there appear some extra terms in the computation which are proportional to the structure constants @xmath46 .",
    "they give rise to a chern - simons like term in the effective action .    for @xmath47 branes of type @xmath48 on top of each other",
    ", the results of the complete computation @xcite can be summarised in the following formula , @xmath49 where we defined the ` curvature form ' @xmath50 and some non - commutative analogue @xmath51 of the chern - simons form by the expressions @xmath52",

    "the effective action ( [ effact ] ) is the unique combination of @xmath63 and @xmath64 in which mass terms cancel .",
    "stationary points of the action ( [ effact ] ) describe condensates on a stack of @xmath47 branes of type @xmath48 .",
    "a simple analysis reveals that there is an interesting set of such classical solutions that has no analogue for flat branes in flat backgrounds .",
    "in fact , any @xmath65-dimensional representation of the lie algebra su(2 ) lies in a local minimum of the action ( [ effact ] ) .",
    "their interpretation was found in @xcite . for simplicity",
    "we restrict our discussion to a stack of @xmath47 point - like branes ( @xmath66 ) at the origin of su(2 ) . in this case , @xmath67 so that we need a @xmath47-dimensional representation of su(2 ) to solve the equations of motion .",
    "let us choose the @xmath47-dimensional irreducible representation @xmath68 .",
    "our claim then is that this drives the initial stack of @xmath47 point - like branes at the origin into a final configuration containing only a single brane wrapping the sphere of type @xmath69 , i.e.   @xmath70 support for this statement comes from the comparison of tensions and the fluctuation spectrum ( see @xcite ) .",
    "similar effects have been described for branes in rr - background fields @xcite .",
    "the advantage of our scenario with nsns - background fields is that it can be treated in perturbative string theory so that string effects may be taken into account .",
    "now we would like to understand the dynamics of branes in the stringy regime . proceeding along the lines of the previous subsection would force us to include higher order corrections to the effective action .",
    "unfortunately , such a complete control of the brane dynamics in the stringy regime is out of reach .",
    "but we could be somewhat less ambitious and ask whether at least some of the solutions we found in the large volume limit possess a deformation into the small volume theory and if so , which fixed points they correspond to .",
    "it turns out that this is possible for all the processes that are obtained from constant gauge fields on the brane .",
    "in fact , constant condensates on branes on group manifolds are very closely related to the low temperature fixed point of kondo models .",
    "consequently , the analysis of such condensation processes in the stringy regime can be based upon very thorough renormalization group studies that go even back to the work of wilson .    as an aside , let us briefly discuss how the kondo problem and the study of constant gauge field condensates translate into each other @xcite .",
    "the kondo model is designed to understand the effect of magnetic impurities on the low temperature conductance properties of a conductor .",
    "the latter can have electrons in a number @xmath5 of conduction bands .",
    "we can build several currents from the basic fermionic fields . among them",
    "is the spin current @xmath71 which gives rise to a @xmath72 current algebra .",
    "the coordinate @xmath73 measures the radial distance from a spin @xmath74 impurity at @xmath75 to which the spin current couples .",
    "this coupling involves a @xmath76-dimensional irreducible representation @xmath77 of su(2 ) and it is of the form @xmath78 this term is identical to the coupling of open string ends to a background gauge field @xmath79 .",
    "hence , @xmath80 may be interpreted as a constant gauge field on a chan - paton bundle of rank @xmath81 .",
    "now let us consider a supersymmetric theory on a finite 3-sphere with @xmath82 units of nsns flux passing through .",
    "in this case one can have ( anti-)branes wrapping @xmath83 different integer conjugacy classes labelled by @xmath84 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "as in the limit of infinite level @xmath5 , we consider a stack of @xmath47 point - like branes at the origin and a field @xmath85 whose components give rise to an irreducible representation of su(2 ) .",
    "then renormalization group studies show that this stack will decay into a single object wrapping the conjugacy class @xmath69 on @xmath2 .",
    "if we stack more and more point - like branes at the origin the radius of the sphere that is wrapped by the resulting object will first grow , then decrease , and finally a stack of @xmath83 point - like branes at @xmath21 will decay to a single point - like object at @xmath22 ( see fig .",
    "[ su2branen ] ) . by taking orientations into account",
    ", one can see that the final point - like object is the translate of an anti - brane at @xmath21 .",
    "hence , we conclude that the stack of @xmath83 point - like branes at @xmath21 has decayed into a single point - like anti - brane at @xmath22 .    [ 0.2 ]    we would like to see whether the described brane dynamics obey some conservation laws , i.e.  if we can assign charges to the branes that are conserved in physical processes . in other words",
    ", we are looking for some discrete abelian group @xmath86 , where @xmath87 denotes the physical background , and a map from arbitrary brane configurations to @xmath86 such that the map is invariant under renormalization group flows .    in our concrete example",
    ", we may assign charge  @xmath88 to the point - like branes at @xmath21 and if we want the charge to be conserved , the decay product of @xmath83 such point - like branes must have charge @xmath83 . on the other hand we identified the latter with a single anti - brane which has charge @xmath89 .",
    "thus we have to identify @xmath83 and @xmath89 which means that charge is only well - defined modulo @xmath90 @xcite , i.e.   @xmath91 according to a proposal of bouwknegt and mathai @xcite , the brane charges on a background @xmath92 with non - vanishing nsns 3-form field @xmath8 take values in some twisted k - groups @xmath93 which feel the presence of @xmath94 . in most cases , these k - groups are difficult to compute . but for @xmath2 the answer is known to be @xmath95 . here , @xmath8 is the @xmath96 multiple of the volume form @xmath7 for the unit sphere .",
    "hence , @xmath97 as predicted in @xcite .",
    "the wzw model is probably the most important ingredient in conformal field theory model building through coset and orbifold constructions .",
    "hence , one expects that the results for brane dynamics on group manifolds which we reviewed above become relevant for many other string backgrounds . in this section",
    "we demonstrate how one may descent from the su(2 ) wzw model to the coset su(2)/u(1 ) describing parafermions .",
    "a more detailed discussion of such constructions will appear in a forthcoming paper .    to begin with ,",
    "let us briefly recall the coset construction su(2)@xmath98u@xmath99 of parafermions . in the usual conventions , the numerator theory has sectors @xmath100 where @xmath101 .",
    "we embed the free bosonic theory u@xmath99 such that its current gets identified with the component @xmath102 of the su(2 ) current .",
    "the sectors of the denominator algebra u@xmath99 carry a label @xmath103 . according to the standard rules of the coset construction",
    ", we can label the sectors @xmath104 of the coset algebra by pairs @xmath105 such that the sum @xmath106 is even .",
    "our aim now is to select those states in the sectors @xmath104 of the parafermionic algebra that become massless as we send @xmath5 to infinity .",
    "we can find them within the subspace @xmath107 of the sector @xmath100 for the su(2 ) current algebra .",
    "here , @xmath108 denotes the conformal dimension of the state @xmath109 .",
    "a careful analysis of the coset construction reveals that states @xmath110 obeying @xmath111 give rise to marginal or marginally relevant perturbations in the @xmath35 limit of parafermion theories .",
    "we will apply this result shortly after introducing the maximally symmetric branes in our coset theory .",
    "cardy s construction provides us with a set of boundary conformal field theories which are in unique correspondence with sectors of the chiral algebra , i.e.  they are labelled by @xmath112 being in the same range as @xmath105 above . in the large @xmath5 limit ,",
    "the tension @xmath113 of the associated branes is @xmath114 times the value of the tension @xmath115 .",
    "this implies that the branes of type @xmath116 are the lightest in the theory .",
    "moreover , one can compute the open string spectrum for any theory @xmath112 from the fusion rules of the parafermion algebra .",
    "it contains the sectors @xmath117 where @xmath118 ranges from @xmath119 to @xmath120 , provided that @xmath121 .",
    "since all the sectors have @xmath122 , the massless states in the large @xmath5 regime are found by imposing the conditions ( [ restr ] ) with @xmath122 .",
    "the effective field theory for these massless states of the brane @xmath112 can be obtained by a reduction from the effective theory ( [ effact ] ) of a single brane @xmath123 in the wzw model . to this end , we rewrite the constraints ( [ restr ] ) with @xmath122 in terms of the world - volume fields @xmath53 , @xmath124 for large @xmath5 , the second equation becomes @xmath125 so that we can drop @xmath126 from the action ( [ effact ] ) .",
    "a short computation using the first equation in ( [ red ] ) then gives the following effective action for the coset brane @xmath127   \\mbox{where}\\ \\ \\",

    "@xmath129 run through @xmath130 only and the matrices @xmath131 are elements of @xmath132 .",
    "this action still contains @xmath133 parameters . through the constraints ( [ red ] )",
    ", we select a @xmath120-dimensional subspace of physical parameters which correspond to marginally relevant perturbations of the brane in our coset theory . the action ( [ redeffact ] ) together with the constraints ( [ red ] ) describes the dynamics of branes in the large @xmath5 regime of parafermions .",
    "it is rather easy to see that for @xmath134 the effective theory ( [ redeffact ] ) , ( [ red ] ) has a stationary point at the following non - constant field @xmath135 insertion of this solution into the effective action ( [ redeffact ] ) gives a positive value , indicating that our brane @xmath112 is the decay product of some configuration with higher mass .",
    "we will shortly identify this configuration as a chain of branes @xmath136 note that all the constituent branes @xmath137 have minimal tension .",
    "evidence for our interpretation comes again from the comparison of tensions and from studying the spectrum of fluctuations around the solution ( [ sol ] ) .",
    "the analysis of tensions is identical to the corresponding argument in @xcite and , similar to the case of branes on su(2 ) , it suggests that the brane @xmath112 is obtained as a bound state from @xmath138 branes of type @xmath137 with @xmath139 even . on the other hand , the tension is insensitive to the value @xmath139 and hence it does not help us in deciding which of the branes @xmath137 do actually appear . this information is encoded partially in the spectrum of fluctuation around our solution .",
    "note that the massless states ( at @xmath140 ) of the configuration ( [ chain ] ) come exclusively from open strings stretching between two neighbouring branes @xmath137,@xmath141 and each such pair contributes two massless states .",
    "hence , there are @xmath120 massless states associated with the chain ( [ chain ] ) . at large but finite @xmath5 , the mass square of these states receives a small correction of the form @xmath142 .",
    "if one expands the effective action ( [ redeffact ] ) around the solution ( [ sol ] ) one finds that the @xmath120 fluctuations which obey the constraints ( [ red ] ) all have the same mass square given by @xmath143 .",
    "this is in perfect agreement with the spectrum of the configuration ( [ chain ] ) .",
    "even finer information comes from the couplings between the branes and the bulk fields @xmath144 using the fact that , to first order in @xmath128 , these couplings remain unchanged under the rg flow .",
    "our results can easily be extended to the @xmath0 supersymmetric minimal models .",
    "the latter are obtained as su(2)@xmath145u@xmath146/u@xmath147 coset theories .",
    "now we need three integers @xmath148 to label sectors , where @xmath149 , @xmath150 and @xmath151 are subjected to the selection rule @xmath152 even .",
    "maximally symmetric branes are labelled by triples @xmath153 from the same set .",
    "we shall restrict our attention to the cases with @xmath154 .",
    "the u@xmath155 factor in the numerator contributes an additional field x which enters the effective action ( [ redeffact ] ) minimally coupled to the gauge fields @xmath156 . the solution ( [ sol ] ) carries over to the new theory if we set x @xmath157 and its interpretation is the same as for parafermions since the u@xmath155 theory remains unperturbed .",
    "it means once more that a chain of @xmath47 adjacent ( @xmath158)-branes decays into a single ( @xmath159)-brane . this process admits for a very suggestive pictorial presentation .",
    "maldacena , moore and seiberg @xcite proposed recently to think of the target space of parafermion models as a disc with @xmath160 equidistant punctures at the boundary labelled by a @xmath160-periodic integer @xmath161 .",
    "a brane @xmath112 is then represented through a straight line stretching between the points @xmath162 and @xmath163 . in the described process",
    ", a chain of branes , each of minimal length , decays to a brane forming a straight line between the ends of the chain as shown in fig .  2 ( see also @xcite for related pictures ) .",
    "figure 2 : the chain ( [ chain ] ) of branes can decay into a single brane @xmath112 .",
    "in figure 2 we have tacitly assumed that the processes we identified in the large @xmath5 regime persist to finite values of @xmath5 . for branes on su(2 ) ,",
    "analogous results were described in section 4 .",
    "similar systematic investigations in case of other cft backgrounds do not exist .",
    "but the results of @xcite and the comparison with exact studies ( see e.g.  @xcite ) in particular models display a remarkable stability of the rg flows as we move away from the decoupling limit .",
    "the approach to brane dynamics in non - trivial backgrounds that we have presented in this note may be extended in several different directions .",
    "it is certainly possible to study branes on group manifolds g other than su(2 ) .",
    "once more , one can have branes localised along conjugacy classes and the above analysis extends to them without any difficulties .",
    "more interestingly , there exist new types of branes whenever the group g admits for non - trivial outer automorphism .",
    "their coupling to closed string modes was found in @xcite and it was shown that they wrap so - called twisted conjugacy classes @xcite .",
    "constant condensates on stacks of such branes where studied in @xcite along the lines of section 4 .",
    "it was also shown there that each of the two types of branes contributes its own summand @xmath164 to the charge group @xmath165g@xmath166 and the order @xmath167 was determined for both summands in the case g @xmath168 su(@xmath169 ) .",
    "the groups su(@xmath169 ) , @xmath170 can not appear directly as part of a string background since their central charge is too large .",
    "but they can show up as building blocks of a coset theory with smaller central charge .",
    "hence , when combined with suitable extensions of section 5 , brane dynamics on group manifolds other than su(2 ) can become relevant for string backgrounds .",
    "the ideas of section 5 should be directly relevant for branes in gepner models ( see @xcite ) and for the computations of superpotentials that were initiated in @xcite .",
