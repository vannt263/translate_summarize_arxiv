    "cell s internal state is now measurable with expression data on a few thousand genes using transcriptome analysis .",

    "indeed , the common trend in the transcriptome analysis is to uncover a set of genes that specifically respond to specific environmental changes , while discarding other high - dimensional data that are gathered .",
    "search for a simple law that governs a global change in expressions across genes has not seriously been attempted ,    on the other hand , biologists are traditionally interested in macroscopic quantity such as activity , plasticity , and robustness@xcite , even though these have involved qualitative , rather than quantitative , characteristics so far . at this stage , then , it will be crucial to extract such macroscopic quantities from a vast amount of the expression data available using transcriptome analysis . here , the simplest candidate for such macroscopic quantity will be the growth rate in cell population .",
    "then , can we extract some universal relationship on global gene expression changes and connect it with a macroscopic ( population ) growth rate of cell ?    in searching for such universal relationship , it will be relevant to restrict cell states of our concern , just as thermodynamics , the celebrated macroscopic phenomenological theory is established by restricting our concern to thermal equilibrium . of course , a cell is not in a state of static equilibrium , but involves complex dynamics , and grows ( and divides ) in time .",
    "thus we can not apply the formulation in thermodynamics directly .",
    "however , we can instead follow the spirit in thermodynamics ; we restrict our concern to a system with steady growth state and intend to extract a common law that should hold globally to such state . considering that the cell keeps its internal state across cell divisions",
    ", it is expected that all the components grow with a common rate . as a consequence of such restriction ,",
    "then , we may hope to uncover a universal relationship across changes in gene expressions .",
    "indeed , in transcriptome analysis data , ( e.g.,@xcite ) , existence of the correlation in the expression changes across a vast number of genes is suggested @xcite , which are brought about through adaptation and evolution @xcite .    here",
    ", we first analyze the transcriptome data in bacteria undergoing stress , to confirm a general relationship between global changes across expression of all genes .",
    "to explain such a general relationship in a cellular state , we study a general consequence imposed by a constraint of the cellular states achieved by restricting our concern only to cells that maintain steady growth , i.e. , those cells that can grow and divide , retaining their state . within this constraint ,",

    "for each of these three conditions , three levels of stresses ( @xmath7 high , medium , low ) were used , so that the absolute expression levels , represented by @xmath8 for @xmath2-th gene , are measured over a total of @xmath9 conditions in addition to the original ( stress - free ) condition . to study behavior of cells under steady - growth conditions ,",

    "note that , throughout the paper , the point of interest is cellular behavior after recovery of the steady - growth state ( which could be termed _",
    "adaptation _ , even though this does not necessarily imply the optimization of the growth rate or the genetic change ) .",
    "from these measurements , we calculated the change in gene expressions levels between the original state and that of a system experiencing environmental stress .",

    ", width=264 ]    * theory for the steady - growth state *    to discuss changes in cellular state in response to environmental changes , we introduce a simple theory assuming a steady - growth state in a cell .",
    "when a cell grows at this steady state and reproduces itself , all the components it contains , e.g. , the proteins that are expressed , have to be approximately doubled@xcite .",
    "the abundance of each component increases at an almost equal rate over the time - scale of cell division ; if the growth rates of some components were lower than that of others , the component would become diluted over time , and after some divisions , the component would be  extinct \" , so that the cell state would not accommodate steady growth .",
    "for a cell to maintain the same internal state , all the components have to be synthesized at the same rate across cell divisions .",
    "this steady - growth condition has to be satisfied amidst the nonlinearity , complexity , and stochasticity of biochemical reactions .",
    "consider a cell consisting of @xmath22 chemical components , of which the synthesis allows it to grow and divide . in a cellular state under steady - growth conditions ,",
    "the cell number increases exponentially over time , and thus each component within the cell also increases exponentially , as is expected from the autocatalytic nature of chemicals as a set of intracellular components .",
    "hence , it is natural to assume that the abundance of components within the cell ( as well as the cell volume ) would generally grow exponentially over a cell division cycle .",
    "then , the abundance of @xmath23-th component increases with @xmath24 , over a cell division cycle , where @xmath25 is the growth rate of the component @xmath23 .",
    "however , the steady - growth constraint under which the concentration of each component @xmath23 is maintained implies that @xmath26 for all components @xmath23 . as @xmath25 is determined through the biochemical reactions in a cell , given from @xmath22-dimensional dynamics , the constraint @xmath27 yields @xmath28 constraints on the @xmath22-dimensional state space ( see fig .",
    "after changes in the environment , there may be a transient period during which the cells have not yet attained this steady - growth state , but the steady state is likely to be attained over time , as long as the cell maintains all of its internal components .",
    "the growth rate @xmath19 itself is changed in response to a new condition , but the @xmath28 constraints @xmath27 are preserved .",
    "hence , over the long term , in response to environmental changes , the cell progresses along a one - dimensional curve in an @xmath22-dimensional state space of all components .",
    "this creates a general constraint on all gene expression levels .",
    "considering that @xmath22 represents a vast number ( say @xmath29 protein species in typical cells ) , this reduction from @xmath22 to 1 is quite marked .",
    "naturally , cells are not always in this steady - growth state .",
    "when a cell experiences different conditions , the growth rate of each component changes so that the concentration of each component is altered .",
    "later , however , cells return to a steady growth - state with altered compositions of these components , somewhat analogous to the restrictions of thermal equilibrium state : when conditions within a system are changed , the temperature @xmath30 can become non - uniform .",
    "the temperature @xmath31 at a box @xmath23 can vary ( sometimes on a microscopic scale , invalidating the existence of temperature itself ) , but after approaching equilibrium , all @xmath31 s are equal , so that a description using a few variables again becomes possible .",
    "likewise , in our case , @xmath25 in the transient state could differ by component @xmath23 , but after recovery of steady growth , all @xmath25 s are equal , allowing for a macroscopic description .",
    "next , we investigate the consequence of this constraint on steady growth .",
    "consider the concentration @xmath32 of each component .",
    "since each component @xmath23 is synthesized ( or decomposed ) in relationship to other components , the temporal change in the concentration of each component is represented as a function of the concentrations of the component itself and that of others , for instance by the rate - equation in chemical kinetics .",
    "furthermore , each component , as well as the cell volume , grows at the rate @xmath19 .",
    "thus , the concentrations are diluted by this rate .",
    "hence , the time - change of a concentration is given by    @xmath33    now , the stationary state is given by a fixed point condition @xmath34 for all @xmath23 .",
    "for the sake of convenience , let us denote @xmath35 , and @xmath36 . then , eq .",
    "( 1 ) can be written as @xmath37 with the corresponding fixed point solution @xmath38    in response to environmental changes , the growth rate @xmath19 itself changes , as does each concentration @xmath39 ; however , the @xmath28 condition requiring that @xmath40 is independent of @xmath23 for all @xmath41 has to be satisfied .",
    "thus , a cell has to stay at a 1-dimensional curve in the @xmath22-dimensional space , under a given change in the environmental conditions ( e.g. , against changes in stress strength ; see fig .",
    "2a ) . with an environmental change , all concentrations , @xmath19 , and @xmath42",
    "generally change , while the condition that @xmath40 is independent of @xmath23 is maintained as long as the cells continue steady - state growth .",
    "we assume that all the components @xmath43 are retained after the change in environmental conditions , and that no new component ( gene ) emerges . taken together , the cellular state is represented on an @xmath22-dimensional space .",
    "now , consider intracellular changes in response to environmental changes as being represented by a set of continuous parameters @xmath44 , which denote environmental changes under the stress condition @xmath18 . for the moment , we omit the stress type @xmath18 . with this parameterization @xmath13",
    ", the steady - growth condition leads to @xmath45    we consider the parameter change from @xmath46 to @xmath13 , where each @xmath47 changes from @xmath47 at @xmath46 , to @xmath48 , which is accompanied by a change from @xmath19 to @xmath49 . assuming a gradual change in the dynamics @xmath50",
    ", we introduce a partial derivative of @xmath51 by @xmath52 at @xmath53 , which gives the jacobi matrix @xmath54 . now considering the condition under which the change is sufficiently small , and taking only the linear term in @xmath1",
    ", we get @xmath55 with @xmath56    under the linear conditions we are concerned with , @xmath57 , so that @xmath58 holds for a constant @xmath59 .",
    "accordingly , we obtain @xmath60 where @xmath61 . since the latter term on the right - hand side is independent of the magnitude of @xmath13 , we simply have @xmath62 over all @xmath2 ( see fig",
    ". 2b ) .",
    "hence , the change in the expression @xmath52 in response to external change is proportional over all components @xmath2 in this form .",
    "this provides a possible explanation for the observed transcriptome analysis shown fig .",
    "1 . according to our theory , the proportion coefficient in the expression level should agree with the growth rate . here",
    ", for each condition , the change in the growth rate @xmath63 was also measured .",
    "( @xmath18 is either osmotic , heat , or starvation stress ) . in fig .",
    "3 , we compared the slope of the changes in gene expression , i.e. , the common ratio @xmath64 , with @xmath65 .",
    "the plot shows rather good agreement between these two . in this respect ,",
    "the theory based on steady - state growth and linearization of changes in stress applies well to the transcriptome change .",

    "however , expression changes can also be compared across different stress conditions .",
    "interestingly , the genome - wide correlation of expression levels is not restricted to a change in the same stress condition . in fig . 4 , @xmath67 , which plots expression changes across different stress conditions @xmath68 ( @xmath69 either starvation , heat , or osmotic stress ) , correlation",
    "is still observed , even though there are more genes that deviate from the common proportionality , leading to lower correlation coefficients , as compared with the correlations observed under the same stress conditions .",
    "the correlation is also discernible for other choices of @xmath70 , as shown in supplemental fig .",
    "s1 , where all the correlation diagrams of @xmath71 across all possible stress conditions are plotted .",
    "note that such proportionality across genes has also been suggested for several experiments , over different environmental conditions@xcite .",
    "the finding of correlation , even with reduced proportionality , implies a common trend in changes in expression across many genes , which is not necessarily the result of a given stress condition , but is a concept that holds across different environmental conditions .",
    "since gene expression dynamics are very high - dimensional , this correlation suggests the existence of a strong constraint to adaptive changes in expression dynamics .",
    "below , we discuss the theoretical origin of this correlation . in eqs .",
    "( 5)-(6 ) , the environmental change @xmath13 is no longer represented by a scalar variable , but the environmental change involves a different direction , so that @xmath72 and @xmath73 depend on the type of environmental ( stress ) condition @xmath18 .",
    "hence , instead of eq .",
    "( 7 ) , we get @xmath74 here , the right - hand side ( rhs ) , in general , depends on each gene @xmath2 .",
    "this could blur the proportionality in @xmath75 over all genes . in the following case , however , the dependence of the rhs on @xmath2 is relaxed , to support approximate proportionality as indicated in fig .",
    "when @xmath72 and @xmath76 are independent of @xmath23 , which we denote as @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively , the rhs is reduced to @xmath79 so that the common proportionality of the change in expression holds , while the proportion coefficient is shifted from a simple ratio between the growth - rate changes @xmath21 .",
    "sometimes , environmental changes affect all processes , globally .",
    "for example , if temperature or nutrient resources are increased , the synthesis ( or decomposition ) rates of all reaction processes are amplified across the board .",
    "of course , there are some genes for which @xmath80 deviates from the above common value .",
    "if the number of such genes with a specific response is small ( and@xmath81or , its influence on other genes is small , i.e. , the jacobi matrix is sparse ) , then the contributions from genes with a common @xmath82 value makes up the major portion of the summation in the rhs of eq .",
    "if we neglect the minor contributions from a few specific genes , common proportionality could generally be maintained .",
    "indeed , only a limited number of specific genes are expected to respond directly to environmental changes .    according to this approximation",
    ", the proportion coefficient @xmath83 deviates from @xmath84 by the factor @xmath85 .",
    "note that this correction in the proportion coefficient depends only on the type , but not on the strength of each stress .",
    "we examined this point from the transcriptome data analyzed here , by plotting the proportion coefficient in @xmath86 versus @xmath87 in fig .",
    "the correlation between @xmath1 and the growth rate in this figure also exists across different stress conditions . additionally , the coefficient @xmath86 is roughly proportional to @xmath88 with a proportion coefficient that is mainly determined by the pair of stress types , over different strengths .    undeniably , the proportionality over different stress types is not optimal .",
    "indeed , existence of gene - specific dependence @xmath89 leads to scattering in @xmath90 ( for @xmath91 ) around the common proportionality by genes , and there are more genes that deviate from the common proportionality for @xmath91 than those for @xmath92 ( compare fig.4 with fig.1 ) , so that the estimation of the proportion coefficient in fig.5 is not so reliable especially for those with lower correlation coefficient .     and @xmath93 for different stress types .",
    "the combination of stresses @xmath94 is ( osmotic , heat ) for ( a ) , ( osmotic , starvation ) for ( b ) , and ( heat , starvation ) for ( c ) , respectively .",
    "the strengths of the stress @xmath3 and @xmath4 are fixed as high in these figures .",
    "the slopes are 0.65 , 0.24 , and 0.36 for ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) , respectively , while the correlation coefficient for each data is 0.40 ( a ) , 0.43 ( b ) and 0.54(c ) . the relationships between the changes in gene expression for all possible combinations are presented in supplemental fig .",

    "a lower correlation indicates that the fit of the slope may be less accurate .",
    ", width=340 ]",
    "we have shown here that steady growth conditions lead to a global constraint over all gene expression patterns . with a few additional assumptions ,",
    "the proportionality in the change in expression across genes can be derived , in which the proportion coefficient is mainly governed by the change in the growth rate .",
    "these theoretical predictions were compared with several bacterial gene expression experiments , with approximate agreement .",
    "the correlation with the growth rate is also interpreted by neglecting the direct environment dependence in @xmath97 , i.e. , by replacing it with @xmath98 for most genes @xmath2 . in other words ,",
    "external environmental changes trigger changes in the levels of some components @xmath99 , which introduces a change in the growth rate @xmath100 . for the stationary state , only the condition @xmath101 is considered . with this approximation ,",
    "the term for direct environmental changes @xmath102 is neglected , and eq .",
    "( 7 ) follows directly , so that growth rate changes determine gene expression changes globally .",
    "indeed , the experimental data may suggest that the growth - rate makes the major contribution to changes in gene expression .",
    "this dominancy of growth - rate is , however , imperfect , so that the environment - specific term @xmath89 has to be taken into account to compare expression of genes across different stress conditions . in our simple approximation that neglects gene dependence of @xmath89",
    ", @xmath103 represents the degree of the direct influence of the environment on gene expression dynamics , as compared with the influence on the growth rate .    as another possible estimate of this factor @xmath103 , we directly measured the variance of changes in expression across genes , i.e. , @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the average over all genes ( see supplemental fig .",
    "according to eqs .",
    "( 8) and ( 9 ) , this factor grows in proportion to @xmath106 ( in addition to the variances determined by the jacobi matrices , which are independent of environmental stress @xmath18 ) . as shown in supplemental fig .",
    "s2 , the factor @xmath107 decreases in the order of @xmath5 osmotic stress , starvation , and heat stress .",
    "indeed , the deviation from @xmath108 in fig . 5 is consistent with the above order of @xmath107 .",
    "furthermore , the environment - specific response of gene expression @xmath89 generally depends on each gene @xmath23 . here",
    ", genes that show specific responses to a given environment @xmath44 may be few , while most others may not be influenced directly by the environment ; their expression levels may be mostly determined by the homeostatic growth condition @xmath109 .",
    "distinguishing such homeostatic genes from those that show specific responses to individual environmental stresses will be important as the next step in the statistical analysis of adaptation .    in eq.(1 )",
    ", we have not assumed any specific form with particular dependence upon some protein species . in recent study ,",
    "specific dependence of the fraction of ribosomal proteins upon the growth rate is discussed by adopting a description by few degrees of protein groups @xcite",
    ". it will be interesting to introduce some specific genes in our formulation while keeping high - dimensional expression dynamics .",
    "it is also interesting to note that gene expression changes @xmath1 across genes correlate between environmental and genetic perturbations .",
    "in fact , ying et al.@xcite measured the changes in gene expression induced by the environmental perturbation @xmath110 , and the genetic perturbation @xmath111 induced by external reduction of several genes .",
    "again , they observed a strong correlation between @xmath112 and @xmath113 across genes ( see fig . 5 of @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , our theory can also be applied to adaptive evolution , in which growth rate is first reduced by encountering a novel environment @xmath110 , and then recovers by genetic changes @xmath114 through evolution , so that @xmath115 . according to our relationship",
    ", changes in gene expression levels introduced by a new environment is reduced through adaptive evolution , i.e. , @xmath116 , as discussed . in other words , there is a common homeostatic trend for the expression of most genes to return to the original level , as extensively observed experimentally@xcite .",
    "a few issues should be considered prior to the application of the theory presented here .",
    "first , it must be assumed that the components continue to exist , and that novel components do not appear . under this condition ,",
    "the postulate for common @xmath25 generally holds , even though the linear approximation does not .",
    "however , even if some components do become extinct or novel components emerge , the constraint may still exist for other components , and the proportionality relationship eq .",
    "( 7 ) holds approximately , as long as the influence of the extinct or emerging components is limited .",
    "second , it is assumed that the fixed - point of eq .",
    "( 1 ) is not split by bifurcation .",
    "when bifurcation occurs , we can apply our theory along each branch ( under the condition that the inverse jacobi matrix exists ) , but direct comparisons can not be made across different branches .",
    "moreover , in some cases , the attractor of the expression level is not a fixed - point , but is an oscillatory state .",
    "however , as long as the oscillation period is shorter than the cell division time , one can use the average @xmath25 of the period , instead of @xmath25 , leaving the present argument valid .",
    "third , we adopted a linearization approximation to obtain eq .",
    "( 7 ) . for larger changes in external conditions",
    ", there will be a gene - specific correction to the linear relationship eq .",
    "however , linearization is adopted after taking the logarithm of gene expression levels , so that the size of @xmath117 may not be so restrictive when seen in the original scale of gene expression @xmath50 .",
    "indeed , the agreement with the theory shown in figs .",
    "1 and 3 for the same stress indicates that the linearization approximation is valid , even though the growth rate is reduced to less than half of the original .",
    "the present theory facilitates description of a cellular system with only few macroscopic variables , for characterization of adaptation and evolution .",
    "furthermore , our theory with regards to common @xmath25 can be applied to any system of stationary growth .",
    "as presented , each element @xmath23 represents a replicating molecule within a cell , but , similarly , we can apply our theory by using such an element to describe cells of different types within an organism . alternatively , macroscopically , one can assign an element as a population of each species in a stationary ecosystem .",
