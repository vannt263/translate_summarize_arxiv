    "direction of arrival ( doa ) estimation aims at retrieving the position of multiple active signals in a scene . considering @xmath0 narrowband sources of center frequency @xmath1 , the commonly used signal model in the time - frequency domain writes as @xmath2 where @xmath3 contains the short time fourier transform ( stft ) of @xmath4 microphone inputs at time instance @xmath5 , @xmath6 is additive gaussian noise , and @xmath7 contains information about the delays between the microphone inputs for the respective @xmath0 sources . considering a planar circular array of equispaced omnidirectional sensors placed at a radius @xmath8 and assuming all sources are in the same plane as the array , the columns of @xmath9 are @xmath10 with @xmath11 being the azimuth angles defining the original incident direction of the true sources , @xmath12 defining the positions of the @xmath13 sensors and @xmath14 .",
    "a common way to estimate the doa of the signals from the input is to define a search grid of locations @xmath15 with @xmath16 around the array and to determine the incident direction of the original sources by evaluating a cost function for all these positions .",
    "in the course of investigating sparse signal models a method has been proposed in @xcite that casts doa estimation as a sparse coding problem . in this approach an analytic dictionary @xmath17",
    "is introduced , whose columns have the same structure as , the difference being that the columns stem from the predefined grid locations @xmath18 instead of the unknown @xmath19 .",
    "this motivates the data model @xmath20 assuming ideal conditions , @xmath21 is a sparse vector and its support is identical to the positions of the active sources . in @xcite",
    "it has been shown that this data model leads to a convex sparse coding approach for doa estimation of narrowband sources , which is commonly referred to as the l1-svd method . especially , the method is robust against overestimating the total number of sources in the scene , which is one of the limitations of the well - known music approach @xcite .",
    "the main drawback , on the other hand , is that the delays at the microphones and thus the dictionary @xmath22 are frequency - dependent .",
    "this becomes a serious obstacle when we turn from narrowband to wideband signals , such as audio sources , which occupy a wide part of the spectrum .",
    "the authors of @xcite discuss three general ideas to make their approach applicable to wideband signals .",
    "an intuitive approach is to estimate @xmath23 for all frequencies separately and to average over the results .",
    "but due to the separate processing the estimation of @xmath24 is incoherent as its support can vary over the frequency range .",
    "the second option , which is concatenating all measurements and dictionaries to solve a joint problem , is not viable in practice as the dimension becomes intangibly large already with a few simultaneously considered frequencies .",
    "the third approach introduces wideband focusing matrices that align the steering vectors for all frequency bins in a frequency region of interest .",
    "however , this processing needs an initial coarse estimate of all source positions , and the approximation quality deteriorates with the distance in frequency @xcite .",
    "recently , luo et al .",
    "@xcite have proposed a subband information fusion method that extends the separate - frequencies approach by an additional penalty term to force coherence between all frequency bands . instead of encoding the inputs separately ,",
    "an overcomplete dictionary is computed out of all the individual inputs and one overall optimization problem is solved to obtain a so - called sparse indicative vector related to the estimated incident direction . on the upside the frequency - coherence is improved as simulated experiments indicate , but on the downside a new dictionary needs to be computed for each input .",
    "a promising approach of inherently frequency - coherent doa estimation is to decompose the wavefield and to transfer the input from the time domain to the modal domain , cf",
    ". @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it has been shown how the doa of several speech signals can be estimated by evaluating the circular harmonic ( ch ) coefficients instead of the time - frequency data .",
    "the proposed approach transfers the concept of the well - known delay - and - sum beamformer ( dsb ) to the circular harmonics beamformer ( chb ) , as the stft coefficients of the input signals are transformed into the modal domain through applying a spatial fast - fourier - transform ( fft ) . by equalizing the ch coefficients at each frequency",
    "an array matrix can be used that is frequency - independent , i.e. in contrast to the steering vectors do not change with the frequency .",
    "the contribution of this work is to introduce the circular harmonics concept to sparsity - based doa estimation of wideband sound signals using a circular microphone array .",
    "we propose a method for localizing an unknown number of wideband sound sources that is coherent over the frequency range and is computationally cheap . in the following",
    "we will recall the required concepts and show how to perform sparsity - based doa estimation with a frequency - independent dictionary using circular harmonics .",
    "simulations and experiments on recorded data compare the approach with the frequency - separated approach and a circular harmonics beamforming technique and show that the proposed algorithm is a viable approach for computationally light doa estimation of multiple wideband sound sources .",
    "wavefield analysis for circular microphone arrays has been studied in the past years @xcite .",
    "the general concept is to assume a continuous circular aperture and to decompose the distribution of sound pressure at each point into a series of eigensolutions of the acoustic wave equation . according to @xcite ,",
    "the momentary pressure at a point @xmath25 and caused by a plane wave front coming from the direction @xmath19 can be written as @xmath26 for a certain wave number @xmath27 depending on the observed frequency @xmath28 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath29 in this fourier series are @xmath30 with @xmath31 being the amplitude of the sound wave and @xmath32 the bessel function of the first kind of order @xmath33 evaluated at @xmath34 .",
    "clearly , this ideal decomposition of the wave field can not be performed in practice as a real microphone array is not a continuous aperture but consists of a finite number of discretely placed sensors . as a consequence , the maximum order @xmath35 of modes that can be observed is limited to @xmath36 , and the infinite summation in becomes a finite sum over @xmath37 .",
    "the approximated inverse transform to that computes the ch coefficients from the microphone inputs up to a certain error @xcite writes as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the detected excitation at the @xmath40-th microphone caused by a sound wave of incident direction @xmath18 .",
    "a straightforward beamforming approach would be to compute one array matrix for each frequency consisting of steering vectors for each direction .",
    "but in the eigenbeamforming approach the knowledge of the structure in the ch coefficients can be used to separate frequency - dependent from direction - dependent terms .",
    "assuming for a moment the ideal case @xmath41 , then the equalization @xmath42 removes all frequency - dependent components and only leaves a purely direction - dependent term . for practical applications parthy et al .",
    "@xcite propose @xmath43 with a smoothing factor @xmath44 .",
    "the need for this regularization lies in the fact that the bessel function of higher orders and with them the denominator are close to zero for small values of @xmath34 , thus causing the equalization to become numerically unstable . following the proposition of @xcite",
    ", we collect the @xmath4-dimensional microphone array input @xmath3 at time instance @xmath5 , apply an stft and compute a vector of sampled ch coefficients @xmath45 according to by applying an fft on @xmath3 .",
    "we then perform the equalization of to obtain @xmath46 .",
    "these preprocessing steps need to be done for each frequency , but the computational effort of the fft operation is negligible compared to the subsequent sparse coding step . in order to estimate the incident direction from the equalized coefficients we now define the array matrix of steering vectors , which for the case of @xmath47 considered angles and @xmath37 observed modes writes as follows @xmath48_{p , q } = e^{-jp\\theta_q}.\\ ] ] if we interpret this steering matrix as a dictionary , the sparse signal model in the ch domain is @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a sparse vector whose support indicates the position of the sources contained in the @xmath5-th frame at a certain wave number @xmath51 for an array radius of @xmath8 , and @xmath6 is additive gaussian noise . at first sight this seems to be the same model as , only that the input data is now in the modal domain instead of the time - frequency domain .",
    "however , due to the coefficient equalization the steering matrix in is frequency - independent , i.e.  it remains unchanged for all frequencies .",
    "this allows us to concatenate the input vectors of all wave numbers @xmath52 to one data matrix @xmath53 and process them jointly within the same data model .",
    "so far only data for a single time step has been considered .",
    "however , block - wise processing can increase the robustness of the doa estimation if the observed signals are stationary over a certain observation period of @xmath54 frames .",
    "thus , from now on we consider an @xmath55-dimensional input matrix @xmath56 , which in the ch domain leads to the cross - frequency data model @xmath57 with the @xmath58-dimensional ch coefficient matrix @xmath59 we assume that ideally , all columns of @xmath60 share the same support and the indices of the non - zero rows correspond to the positions of the respective sources in the mixture . in @xcite a method is proposed for reducing the computational complexity of estimating the support of @xmath60 by applying an svd to the input data beforehand .",
    "the authors keep only the @xmath0-dimensional signal subspace , but report that overestimating @xmath0 up to @xmath61 does not deteriorate the results .",
    "similarly , we decompose @xmath62 and keep the square matrix @xmath63",
    ". thus we aim at minimizing @xmath64 under the condition that @xmath65 is a row - sparse matrix .",
    "the convex relaxation of this problem is @xmath66 with @xmath67 and a parameter @xmath68 that weighs between the fidelity of the sparse approximation and the row - sparsity of @xmath60 . after solving for @xmath60",
    "the incident direction of the sound sources can be estimated from the support of @xmath69 note that taking the sum over the columns of @xmath70 does not introduce further ambiguities in the result since the @xmath71-regularization enforces the columns to share the same support . in a nutshell ,",
    "our wideband audio sparse circular harmonics localizer ( waschl ) solves a joint optimization problem for @xmath72-dimensional time - frequency input data instead of computing the support and estimating the doa separately at each frequency and for each input frame .",
    "thereby , a frequency coherent doa estimate is obtained at tremendously reduced computational effort .",
    "since the proposed solution of fast and coherent frequency - processing almost seems too good to be true it needs to be determined how far the discrete nature of a microphone array and the consequently incomplete sampling of the ch coefficients challenges the performance of our algorithm in comparison to the l1-svd approach @xcite . on the other hand we compare our method to the circular harmonics beamformer ( chb , @xcite ) . while the response of a delay - and - sum ( dsb ) beamformer is rather widespread with significant sidelobes , eigenbeamforming using circular harmonics offers a narrower response with reduced sidelobes .",
    "still , both methods share difficulties with distinguishing sources that are close together . below a certain angular distance",
    "the response of the two sources merges into one common beam , such that they are detected as one .",
    "we refer to this as the angular distinction limit .",
    "in contrast to this , superresolution doa methods such as music @xcite , esprit @xcite or l1-svd @xcite , manage to distinguish sources that are placed tightly together .",
    "investigating for the cause , one finds that different frequencies have different influence on the localization result . at the lower end of the frequency range sources",
    "can be detected uniquely but rather coarse , whereas at higher frequencies the spatial resolution is increased , but aliasing occurs , i.e. the position estimates become ambiguous . averaging over multiple frequencies can resolve these ambiguities , however at a much higher computational effort @xcite and at the risk of introducing additional errors .",
    "our approach belongs to the class of super - resolution methods and therefore should exhibit a similarly high resolution .",
    "however , as discussed before , the finite number of microphones limits the order of modes that can be observed . at lower frequencies",
    "this does not introduce a significant error , since the bessel functions have no significant influence .",
    "but at high frequencies the errors increase since the contributions of higher - order coefficients are no longer negligible and also there are zeros in the bessel functions of lower orders .",
    "thus we assume that the general angular resolution of our approach is about as good as the l1-svd method , but there might be a significant angular distinction limit .      in the following we consider a microphone array of @xmath73 microphones placed equidistantly in a circle of radius @xmath74 m , which record signals at @xmath75khz .",
    "the stft is computed with a window length of @xmath76 samples at @xmath77 overlap , and the observation duration is @xmath78 frames ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) with @xmath77 overlap .",
    "@xmath79 positions are evaluated at once , such that the minimum angular distance is one degree .",
    "empirically , we choose the parameters @xmath80 ( chb , waschl ) and @xmath81 ( l1-svd , waschl ) .",
    "0.22 ) illustrating the minimum angular distinction limits for and chb , title=\"fig : \" ]       0.22 ) illustrating the minimum angular distinction limits for and chb , title=\"fig : \" ]    figure [ fig : res ] shows the results of a simulation in which three sound sources ( uncorrelated pink noise ) are placed at @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively .",
    "this angular distance of the outer sources is varied up to the point where they can just be distinguished as separate sources by the respective localizer . as can be seen",
    ", the chb resolves the sources up to about @xmath84 . at an angular distance of @xmath85",
    "the chb merges all sources into one , while ( and l1-svd , not shown ) resolve all three sources .",
    "for the case of @xmath73 microphones this is the angular distinction limit @xmath86 for our method , but using more microphones ( e.g.  @xmath87 ) would help to improve it ( @xmath88 ) .      in a real - world scenario , i.e.  when continuous doa estimation is performed , computational capacity is the limiting factor rather than the minimum angular resolution . for these purposes a tradeoff needs to be made between resolution , accuracy and processing time . in a first experiment",
    "we localize @xmath89 sequences of spoken human utterances in a common office room to compare the accuracy and the processing time of chb , l1-svd and our method . in each sequence",
    ", three speakers talk for about @xmath90 seconds from fixed positions ( @xmath91 ) , so that @xmath92 estimates of the three angles are obtained over time .",
    "we choose @xmath93 , since we do not want to use a priori knowledge about the number of sources , and because overestimation does not hinder successful localization @xcite .",
    "for the final estimate we average over all frequencies ( chb and l1-svd ) , and over the observation duration ( chb only ) , in order to allow for the fairest possible comparison .",
    "a standard peak finding routine extracts the three most dominant peaks that are at least @xmath94 apart for each observation .",
    "we assign the output to the closest permutation of ground truth angles and compute the absolute angular deviation .",
    "all algorithms are implemented in matlab and we use the cvx toolbox @xcite to solve the second order cone program of the @xmath71-penalized cost function , cf .",
    "we measure the execution time of each algorithm on a desktop computer in order to compare the computational effort .",
    ".comparison of computation time and accuracy for localizing three human speakers in an office room [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table  [ tab : threespeakers ] shows the average processing times and the percentage of correct localization within certain bounds .",
    "a first conclusion that can be drawn is that the l1-svd method clearly gives the most accurate estimation results , and as discussed before it has almost no limitation on the spatial placement of sources .",
    "however , its processing time is tremendous and thus prevents using it in a practical application .",
    "the chb in contrast delivers extremely quickly , but the short computation time comes at the price of rather coarse angular resolution .",
    "our method comes second both in accuracy and in processing time . but even if the accuracy seems to be half way between the competing methods it has to be noted that a spiky response allows for a much easier peak detection , which brings an additional advantage compared to the chb , see figures  [ fig : res ] and [ fig : ambslice ] .",
    "also , the processing time of our method is much closer to realtime performance , which should allow using it in a practical application if the implementation is optimized .    in a last experiment",
    "we compare our method against the chb in a task of continuously localizing a moving sound source . a microphone array ( @xmath95 m , @xmath73 ) is placed outside on a parking lot while an emergency vehicle with activated alarm signal drives around it in circles at @xmath96 meters distance .",
    "the observation window is reduced to @xmath97  frames with an overlap of @xmath90  frames to account for the movement of the vehicle and to reduce the processing delay .",
    "figures  [ fig : ambchb ] and [ fig : ambchl1svd ] show the output of the chb and our algorithm , respectively .    0.3        0.3     0.3     although no ground truth position of the vehicle is available , it can be seen that the doa estimates of both algorithms are in good agreement .",
    "again , the localization result of shows a much narrower localization peak whereas the broad peak and several sidelobes can be seen in the chb output .",
    "finally , the momentary observation in figure  [ fig : ambslice ] illustrates the spikiness of the waschl response compared to the chb .",
    "we propose the ( wideband audio sparse circular harmonics localizer ) method that combines the concept of wavefield analysis and sparsity - exploiting doa estimation .",
    "the approach allows for frequency - coherent localization of an unknown number of sound sources using a circular microphone array . due to the evaluation of circular harmonic coefficients instead of",
    "time delays all frequency components of a wideband audio signal can be processed at once .",
    "experiments prove that the approach is computationally much cheaper than previous methods that process each frequency separately , while delivering much more precise estimates than low - complexity beamforming methods .",
