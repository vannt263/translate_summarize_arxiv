    "this article comprises the set of notes for the short course `` introduction to econophysics , '' delivered at the ii brazilian school on statistical mechanics , held at the university of so paulo , in so carlos , sp , brazil , in february 2004 .",
    "the course consisted of five lectures and was aimed at physics graduate students with no previous exposition to the subject .",
    "the main goal of the course was twofold : i ) to provide a brief introduction to the basic models for pricing financial derivatives ; and ii ) to review some of the related problems in finance to which physicists have made significant contributions over the last decade .",
    "the recent body of work done by physicists and others have produced convincing evidences that the _ standard model of finance _",
    "( see below ) is not fully capable of describing real markets , and hence new ideas and models are called for , some of which have come straight from physics . in selecting some of the more recent work done by physicists to discuss here ,",
    "i have tried to restrict myself to problems that may have a direct bear on models for pricing derivatives . and",
    "even in such cases only a brief overview of the problems is given .",
    "it should then be emphasized that these notes are not intended as a review article on econophysics , which is nowadays a broad interdisciplinary area , but rather as a pedagogical introduction to the mathematics ( and physics ? ) of financial derivatives .",
    "hence no attempt has been made to provide a comprehensive list of references .",
    "no claim of originality is made here regarding the contents of the present notes .",
    "indeed , the basic theory of financial derivatives can now be found in numerous textbooks , written at a different mathematical levels and aiming at specific ( or mixed ) audiences , such as economists @xcite , applied mathematicians @xcite , physicists @xcite , etc .",
    "( here i have listed only the texts that were most often consulted while writing these notes . ) nevertheless , some aspects of presentation given here have not , to my knowledge , appeared before .",
    "an example is the analogy between market efficiency and a certain symmetry principle that is put forward in sec .",
    "v. similarly , the discussion of some of the more recent research problems is based on the already published literature .",
    "an exception is fig .",
    "[ fig : multi ] which contains unpublished results obtained by r.  l.  costa and myself .",
    "the present notes are organized as follows .",
    "section ii gives some basic notions of finance , intended to introduce the terminology as well as the main problems that i shall be considering . in sec .",
    "iii , i discuss the brownian motion , under a more formal viewpoint than most physics graduate students are perhaps familiar with , and then develop the so - called it stochastic calculus .",
    "section iv contains what is the _",
    "raison detre _ of the present notes , the black - scholes model for pricing financial derivatives . in sec .",
    "v , the martingale approach for pricing derivatives is introduced . in particular",
    ", i recast the notions of market efficiency and no - arbitrage as a ` symmetry principle ' and its associated ` conservation law . '",
    "sections vi and vii discuss two possible ways in which real markets may deviate from the standard black - scholes model .",
    "the first of such possibilities is that financial asset prices have non - gaussian distributions ( sec .",
    "vi ) , while the second one concerns the presence of long - range correlations or memory effects in financial data ( sec .",
    "conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "viii . for completeness ,",
    "i give in appendix a the formal definitions of probability space , random variables , and stochastic processes .",
    "suppose you deposit at time @xmath0 an amount of r$ 1 into a bank account that pays an interest rate @xmath1 .",
    "then over time the amount of money you have in the bank , let us call it @xmath2 , will increase at a rate @xmath3 solving this equation subject to the initial condition @xmath4 yields @xmath5    a bank account is an example of a riskless financial assets , since you are guaranteed to receive a known ( usually fixed ) interest rate @xmath1 , regardless of the _ market situation_. roughly speaking , the way banks operate is that they borrow from people who have money to ` spare ' , but are not willing to take risks , and lend ( at higher interest rates ) to people who ` need ' money , say , to invest in some risky enterprise . by diversifying their lending , banks can reduce their overall risk , so that even if some of these loans turn bad they can still meet their obligations to the investors from whom they borrowed .",
    "governments and private companies can also borrow money from investors by issuing _",
    "bonds_. like a bank account , a bond pays a ( fixed or floating ) interest rate on a regular basis , the main difference being that the repayment of the loan occurs only at a specified time , called the bond maturity .",
    "another difference is that bonds are not strictly risk - free assets because there is always a chance that the bond issuer may default on interest payments or ( worse ) on the principal .",
    "however , since governments have a much lower risk to default than corporations , certain government bonds can be considered to be risk free .",
    "a company can also raise capital by issuing _",
    "stocks _ or _ shares_.",
    "basically , a stock represents the ownership of a small piece of the company . by selling many such ` small pieces '",
    ", a company can raise capital at lower costs than if it were to borrow from a bank . as will be discussed",
    "shortly , stocks are _ risky _ financial assets because their prices are subjected to unpredictable fluctuations .",
    "in fact , this is what makes stocks attractive to _ aggressive _ investors who seek to profit from the price fluctuations by pursuing the old advice to `` buy low and sell high . ''",
    "the buying and selling of stocks are usually done in organized exchanges , such as , the new york stock exchange ( nyse ) and the so paulo stock exchange ( bovespa ) .",
    "most stock exchanges have _ indexes _ that represent some sort of average behavior of the corresponding market .",
    "each index has its own methodology .",
    "for example , the _ dow jones industrial average _ of the nyse , which is arguably the most famous stock index , corresponds to an average over 30 industrial companies .",
    "the ibovespa index of the so paulo stock exchange , in contrast , represents the present value of a hypothetical portfolio made up of the stocks that altogether correspond to 80% of the trading volume .",
    "another well known stock index is the standard & poor s 500 ( s&p500 ) index calculated on the basis of data about 500 companies listed on the nyse .",
    "[ many other risky financial assets , such as , currency exchange rates , interest rates , and commodities ( precious metals , oil , grains , etc ) , are traded on organized markets but these will not be discussed any further in the present notes . ]",
    "since a stock represents a ` small piece ' of a company , the stock price should somehow reflect the overall value ( net worth ) of this company .",
    "however , the present value of a firm depends not only on the firm s current situation but also on its _ future performance_. so here one sees already the basic problem in pricing risky financial assets : we are trying to predict the future on the basis of present information .",
    "thus , if a new information is revealed that might in one way or another affect the company s future performance , then the stock price will vary accordingly .",
    "it should therefore be clear from this simple discussion that the future price of a stock will always be subjected to a certain degree of uncertainty .",
    "this is reflected in the typical ` erratic behavior ' that stock prices show when graphed as a function of time .",
    "an example of such a graph is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ibov ] for the case of the ibovespa stock index .",
    "although stock prices may vary in a rather unpredictable way , this does not mean that they can not be modeled .",
    "it says only that they should be described in a _",
    "probabilistic _ fashion . to make the argument a little more precise ,",
    "let @xmath6 be the price of a given stock and suppose we want to write an equation analogous to ( [ eq : db ] ) for the rate of increase of @xmath6 : @xmath7 where @xmath8 represents the ` rate of return ' of the stock .",
    "the question then is : what is @xmath8 ?",
    "from our previous discussion , it is reasonable to expect that @xmath8 could be separated into two components : i ) a predictable mean rate of return , to be denoted by @xmath9 , and ii ) a fluctuating ( ` noisy ' ) term @xmath10 , responsible for the randomness or uncertainty in the stock price .",
    "thus , after writing @xmath11 in ( [ eq : ds1 ] ) we have @xmath12 s. \\label{eq : ds2}\\ ] ] now , one of the best models for ` noise ' is , of course , the white noise , so it should not come as a surprise to a physicist that brownian motion and white noise play an important rle in finance , as will be discussed in detail shortly .      besides the primary financial assets already mentioned ( stocks , commodities , exchange rate , etc ) , many other financial instruments , such as _ options _ and _ futures contracts _ , are traded on organized markets ( exchanges ) .",
    "these securities are generically called _ derivatives _ , because they derive their value from the price of some primary underlying asset .",
    "derivatives are also sometimes referred to as _",
    "contingent claims _ , since their values are contingent on the evolution of the underlying asset . in the present notes ,",
    "i will discuss only one of the most basic derivatives , namely , options .",
    "an option is a contract that gives its holder the right , _ but not the obligation _ , to buy or sell a certain asset for a specified price at some future time .",
    "the other part of the contract , the option underwriter , is obliged to sell or buy the asset at the specified price .",
    "the right to buy ( sell ) is called a _ call _ ( _ put _ ) option .",
    "if the option can only be exercised at the future date specified in the contract , then it is said to be a european option .",
    "american options , on the other hand , can be exercised at any time up to maturity .",
    "( for pedagogical reasons , only european derivatives will be considered here . ) to establish some notation let us give a formal definition of a european option .    a european call option with exercise price ( or strike price )",
    "@xmath13 and maturity ( or expiration date ) @xmath14 on the underlying asset @xmath6 is a contract that gives the holder the right to buy the underlying asset for the price @xmath13 at time @xmath14 .",
    "a european _ put option _ is the same as above , the only difference being that it gives the holder the right to _ sell _ the underlying asset for the exercise price at the expiration date .",
    "if at the expiration date @xmath14 the stock price @xmath15 is above the strike price @xmath13 , the holder of a call option will exercise his right to buy the stock from the underwriter at price @xmath13 and sell it in the market at the spot price @xmath15 , pocketing the difference @xmath16 . on the other hand , if at expiration the price @xmath15 closes below @xmath13 then the call option becomes worthless ( since it would be cheaper to buy the stock in the market ) .",
    "the _ payoff _ of a call option at maturity is therefore given by @xmath17 the payoff diagram of a call option is illustrated by the thick line in fig .",
    "[ fig : call1 ] . in this figure",
    "the thin line represents the price of the call option at an arbitrary time @xmath18 before expiration .",
    "( the otpion price before expiration is always greater than the payoff at expiration on account of the higher risks : the further way the expiration date , the greater the uncertainty regarding the stock price at expiration . ) similarly , the payoff function for a put option is @xmath19 which is shown as the thick line in fig .",
    "[ fig : put1 ] .    because an option entitles the holder to a certain right it commands a premium .",
    "said differently , since the underwriter has an obligation ( while the holder has only rights ) he will demand a payment , to be denoted by @xmath20 , from the holder in order to enter into such a contract .",
    "thus , in the case of a call option , if the option is exercised the holder ( underwriter ) will make a profit ( loss ) given by @xmath21 ; otherwise , the holder ( underwriter ) will have lost ( won ) the amount @xmath20 paid ( received ) for the option . and similarly for a put option .",
    "note then that the holder and the underwriter of an option have opposite views regarding the direction of the market .",
    "for instance , the holder of a call option is betting that the stock price will increase ( past the exercise price ) , whereas the underwriter hopes for the opposite .",
    "now , given that the holder and the underwriter have opposite views as to the direction of the market , how can they possibly agree on the price for the option ? for",
    "if the holder ( underwriter ) suspects that the option is overvalued ( undervalued ) he will walk away from the contract .",
    "the central problem in option pricing is therefore to determine the _ rational price _",
    "price @xmath20 that ensures that neither part ` stands a better chance to win . '    a solution to this problem ( under certain assumptions ) was given in 1973 in the now - famous papers by black and scholes @xcite and merton @xcite , which won scholes and merton the nobel prize in economics in 1997 .",
    "( black had died meanwhile . )",
    "the history of options is however much longer .",
    "in fact , the first scientific study of options dates back to the work by the french mathematician bachelier in 1900 @xcite , who solved the option pricing problem above but under slightly wrong assumptions ; see , e.g. , @xcite for a detailed discussion of bachelier s work .",
    "after an option ( traded on exchange ) is first underwritten , it can subsequently be traded and hence its ` market price ' will be determined by the usual bid - ask auction .",
    "it is nonetheless important to realize that investors in such highly specialized market need some basic pricing theory to rely on , otherwise investing in options would be a rather wild ( and dangerous ) game .",
    "indeed , only after the appearance of the black - scholes model [ and the establishment of the first option exchange in chicago also in 1973 ] have option markets thrived .",
    "one of the main objectives of the present notes is to explain the theoretical framework , namely , the black - scholes model and some of its extensions , in which options and other derivatives are priced .",
    "i will therefore not say much about the practical aspects of trading with options .",
    "investors in derivative markets can be classified into three main categories : _ hedgers _ , _ speculators _ , and _",
    "arbitrageurs_.    _ hedgers _ are interested in using derivatives to reduce the risk they already face in their portfolio .",
    "for example , suppose you own a stock and are afraid that its price might go down within the next months .",
    "one possible way to limit your risk is to sell the stock now and put the money in a bank account .",
    "but then you wo nt profit if the market goes up .",
    "a better _ hedging _ strategy would clearly be to buy a put option on the stock , so that you only have to sell the stock if it goes below a certain price , while getting to keep it if the price goes up . in this case",
    "an option works pretty much as an insurance : you pay a small price ( the option premium @xmath20 ) to insure your holdings against possibly high losses .",
    "_ speculators _ , in contrast to hedgers , seek to make profit by taking risks .",
    "they ` take a position ' in the market , by betting that the price on a given financial asset will go either up or down .",
    "for instance , if you think that a certain stock will go up in the near future , you could `` buy and hold '' the stock in the hope of selling it later at a profit .",
    "but then there is the risk that the price goes down .",
    "a better strategy would thus be to buy a call option on the stock .",
    "this not only is far cheaper than buying the stock itself but also can yield a much higher return on your initial investment .",
    ") however , if the market does not move in the way you expected and the option expire worthless , you end up with a 100% loss .",
    "( that s why speculating with option is a very risky business . )",
    "_ arbitrageurs _ seek to make a _ riskless _ profit by entering simultaneously into transactions in two or more markets , usually without having to make any initial commitment of money .",
    "the possibility of making a riskless profit , starting with no money at all , is called an arbitrage opportunity or , simply , an arbitrage .",
    "a more formal definition of arbitrage will be given later .",
    "for the time being , it suffices to give an example of how an arbitrage opportunity may arise .",
    "but before going into this example , it is necessary first to discuss the notion of a _ short sell_. ` shorting ' means selling an asset that one does not own .",
    "for example , if you place an order to your broker to short a stock , the broker will `` borrow '' a stock from somebody else s account , sell it in the market , and credit the proceeds into _ your _ account .",
    "when you then decide to close your short position ( there usually is a limit on how long an asset can be held short ) , your broker will buy the stock in the market ( taking the money from your account ) and return it to its original owner .",
    "if in the meantime the stock prices decreased , the short sell brings a profit , otherwise the short seller incurs in a loss .",
    "this is why a short sell is usually done simultaneously with another operation to compensate for this risk ( as in the arbitrage example below ) .",
    "it should also be noted , in passing , that buying the actual asset corresponds to taking a ` long position ' on this asset .",
    "let us now consider our hypothetical arbitrage example .",
    "many brazilian companies listed in the so paulo stock exchange also have their stocks traded on the new york stock exchange in the form of the so - called american depository receipt ( adr ) .",
    "suppose then that a stock is quoted in so paulo at r$ 100 , with its adr counterpart trading in new york at us$ 34 , while the currency rate exchange is 1 usd = 2.90 brl . starting with no initial commitment , an arbitrageur could sell short @xmath22 stocks in so paulo and use the proceeds to buy @xmath22 adr s in new york ( and later",
    "have them transferred to so paulo to close his short position ) .",
    "the riskless profit in such operation would be r$ ( @xmath23 .",
    "( in practice , the transaction costs would eliminate the profit for all but large institutional investors @xcite . )",
    "note , however , that such ` mispricing ' can not last long : buy orders in new york will force the adr price up , while sell orders in so paulo will have the opposite effect on the stock price , so that an _ equilibrium price _ for both the adr and the stock is soon reached , whereupon arbitrage will no longer be possible . in this sense , the actions of an _ arbitrageur _ are self - defeating , for they tend to destroy the very arbitrage opportunity he is acting upon  but before this happens a lot of money can be made .",
    "since there are many people looking for such riskless chances to make money , a well - functioning market should be free of arbitrage .",
    "this is the main idea behind the principle that in an _ efficient market _ there is no arbitrage , which is commonly known as the `` no - free - lunch '' condition .",
    "here we shall consider a one - step binomial model to illustrate the principle of no - arbitrage and how it can be used to price derivatives .",
    "suppose that today s price of an ordinary petrobras stocks ( petr3 in their bovespa acronym ) is @xmath24 brl .",
    "imagine then that in the next time - period , say , one month , the stock can either go up to @xmath25 with probability @xmath26 or go down to @xmath27 with probability @xmath28 . for simplicity",
    "let us take @xmath29 .",
    "our binomial model for the stock price dynamics is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bins ] .",
    "note that in this case the stock mean rate of return , @xmath9 , is given by the expression : @xmath30 $ ] , where @xmath31 $ ] denotes the expected value of @xmath6 ( see sec .",
    "[ sec:1dbm ] for more on this notation ) . using the values shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bins ] , one then gets @xmath32 or @xmath33 .",
    "let us also assume that the risk - free interest rate is @xmath34 monthly .",
    "consider next a call option on petr3 with exercise price @xmath35 and expiration in the next time period , i.e. , @xmath36 . referring to ( [ eq : payoff ] ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : bins ] , one immediately sees that at expiration the possible values ( payoffs ) for this option in our binomial model are as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : binc ] : @xmath37 or @xmath38 with equal probability .",
    "the question then is to determine the ` rational ' price @xmath20 that one should pay for the option .",
    "below we will solve this problem using two different but related methods .",
    "the idea here is to illustrate the main principles involved in option pricing , which will be generalized later for the case of continuous time .",
    "first , we describe the so - called delta - hedging argument .",
    "consider a portfolio made up of one option @xmath39 and a short position on @xmath40 stocks , where @xmath40 is to be determined later , and let @xmath41 denote the money value of such a portfolio at time @xmath42 .",
    "we thus have @xmath43 where the minus sign denotes that we have short sold @xmath40 stocks ( i.e. , we ` owe ' @xmath40 stocks in the market ) . from figs .  [",
    "fig : bins ] and [ fig : binc ] , one clearly sees that the possibles values for this portfolio in our one - step model are as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : binv ] .",
    "let us now chose @xmath40 such that the value @xmath44 of the portfolio is the same in both ` market situations . ' referring to fig .",
    "[ fig : binv ] one immediately finds @xmath45 thus , by choosing @xmath46 we have _ completely _ eliminated the risk from our portfolio , since in both ( up or down ) scenarios the portfolio has the same value @xmath44 .",
    "but since this portfolio is riskless , _ its rate of return must be equal to the risk - free interest rate @xmath1 _ , otherwise there would be an arbitrage opportunity , as the following argument shows .",
    "let @xmath47 denote the portfolio rate of return , i.e. , @xmath47 is the solution to the following equation @xmath48 if @xmath49 , then an _ arbitrageur _ should take a long position on ( i.e. , buy ) the option and a short position on @xmath40 stocks . to see why this is an arbitrage ,",
    "let us go through the argument in detail . at time",
    "@xmath0 the arbitrageur s net cashflow would be @xmath50 , which he should put in the bank so that in the next period he would have @xmath51 . at time @xmath52 , he should then close his short position on @xmath40 stocks , either exercising his option ( up scenario ) or buying @xmath40 stocks directly in the market ( down scenario ) . in either case",
    ", he would have to pay the same amount @xmath53 , and hence would be left with a profit of @xmath54 . on the other hand , if @xmath55 the arbitrageur should adopt the opposite strategy : go short on ( i.e. , underwrite ) the option and long on @xmath40 stocks ( borrowing money from the bank to do so ) .",
    "we have thus shown that to avoid arbitrage we must have @xmath56 .",
    "this is indeed a very general principle that deserves to be stated in full : _ in a market free of arbitrage any riskless portfolio must yield the risk - free interest rate @xmath1_. this no - arbitrage principle is at the core of the modern theory of pricing derivatives , and , as such , it will be used several times in these notes .",
    "let us now return to our option pricing problem .",
    "setting @xmath56 in ( [ eq : r ] ) and substituting the values of @xmath57 and @xmath44 given in fig .",
    "[ fig : binv ] , we obtain @xmath58=-\\delta \\ , s_1^d.\\ ] ] inserting the values of @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath27 , and @xmath46 into the equation above , it then follows that the option price that rules out arbitrage is @xmath61    it is instructive to derive the option price through a second method , namely , the _ martingale approach _ or _",
    "risk - neutral valuation_. to this end , we first note that from fig .",
    "[ fig : binc ] we see that the expected value of the option at expiration is @xmath62=\\frac{1}{2 } \\ ; 8 + \\frac{1}{2 } \\ ; 0 = 4 $ ] .",
    "one could then think , not totally unreasonably , that the correct option price should be the expected payoff discounted to the present time with the risk - free interest rate . in this case",
    "one would get @xmath63}{1+r}=\\frac{4}{1.006}=3.98,\\ ] ] which is quite different from the price found in ( [ eq : c0 ] ) .",
    "the faulty point of the argument above is that , while we used the risk - free rate @xmath1 to discount the expected payoff @xmath62 $ ] , we have implicitly used the stock mean rate of return @xmath9 when calculating @xmath62 $ ] .",
    "using these two different rates leads to a wrong price , which would in turn give rise to an arbitrage opportunity .",
    "a way to avoid this arbitrage is to find fictitious probabilities @xmath64 and @xmath65 , with @xmath66 , such that the stock expected return calculated with these new probabilities would equal the risk - free rate @xmath1 .",
    "that is , we must demand that @xmath67 \\equiv q_u \\cdot s_1^{\\rm u } + q_d \\cdot s_1^{\\rm d } , \\label{eq : s0}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 $ ] denotes expected value with respect to the new probabilities @xmath64 and @xmath65 . using the values for @xmath69 and @xmath70 given in fig .",
    "[ fig : bins ] , we easily find that @xmath71 under these probabilities , the expected value @xmath72 $ ] of the option at maturity becomes @xmath72=0.3618\\times 8 + 0.6382\\times 0=2.894 $ ] , which discounted to the present time yields @xmath73}{1+r}=\\frac{2.894}{1.006}=2.88,\\ ] ] thus recovering the same price found with the delta - hedging argument .    note that under the fictitious probability @xmath64 and @xmath65 , all financial assets ( bank account , stock , and option ) in our binomial model yield exactly the same riskless rate @xmath1 .",
    "probabilities that have this property of ` transforming ' risky assets into seemingly risk - free ones are called an _ equivalent martingale measure_. martingale measures is a topic of great relevance in finance , as will be discussed in more detail in sec .",
    "in closing this subsection , it should be noted that the one - step binomial model considered above can be easily generalized to a binomial tree with , say , @xmath22 time steps .",
    "but for want of space this will not be done here .",
    "( i anticipare here , however , that black - scholes model to be considered later corresponds precisely to the continuous - time limit of the binomial multistep model . )",
    "it is perhaps also worth mentioning that binomial models are often used in practice to price exotic derivatives , for which no closed formula exists , since such models are rather easy to implement on the computer ; see , e.g. , @xcite for more details on binomial models .      in the previous subsection",
    "i only considered the price of a ( european ) call option , and the attentive reader might have wondered how can one determine the price of the corresponding put option .",
    "it turns out that there is a simple relationship between european put and call options , so that from the price of one of them we can obtain the price of the other . to see this , form the following portfolio : i ) buy one stock @xmath6 and one put option @xmath74 on this stock with strike price @xmath13 and maturity @xmath14 , and ii ) short one call option @xmath39 with the same strike and maturity as the put option .",
    "the value of such portfolio would thus be @xmath75 now from ( [ eq : payoff ] ) and ( [ eq : payoffp ] ) , one immediately sees that at expiration we have @xmath76 , so that the value of the above portfolio at time @xmath14 becomes simply @xmath77 since this portfolio has a known ( i.e. , riskless ) value at time @xmath78 , it then follows from the no - arbitrage condition that its value at any time @xmath79 must be given by @xmath80 where @xmath1 is the risk - free interest rate . inserting ( [ eq : vk ] ) into ( [ eq : vpsc ] ) immediately yields the so - called put - call parity relation : @xmath81",
    "every physics graduate student is familiar , in one way or another , with the concept of a brownian motion .",
    "the customary introduction @xcite to this subject is through the notion of a random walk , in which the anecdotal drunk walks along a line taking at every time interval @xmath82 one step of size @xmath83 , either to the right or to the left with equal probability .",
    "the position , @xmath84 , of the walker after a time @xmath85 , where @xmath22 is the number of steps taken , represents a _",
    "stochastic process_. ( see appendix a for a formal definition of random variables and stochastic processes . ) as is well known , the probability @xmath86 for the walker to be found at a given position @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is an integer , at given time @xmath42 , is described by a binomial distribution @xcite",
    ".    simply stated , the brownian motion is the stochastic process that results by taking the random walk to the continuous limit : @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 such that @xmath85 and @xmath87 remain finite .",
    "( a more formal definition is given below . ) here , however , some caution with the limits must be taken to ensure that a finite probability density @xmath93 is obtained : one must take @xmath94 and @xmath90 , such that @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is a constant . in this case one",

    "for completeness we have listed in appendix a some basic concepts from probability theory that would be required to make the following discussion more rigorous .",

    "an outcome @xmath315 is a ` market situation . '",
    "the family of subsets @xmath316 specifies the class of events to which probabilities can be assigned .",
    "this is done through the concept of a @xmath96-algebra , whose formal definition is given in appendix a. a probability measure @xmath74 on @xmath316 is simply a function @xmath317 $ ] , satisfying a few ` obvious requirements ' : @xmath318 , @xmath319 , and @xmath320 if @xmath321 .",
    "an element @xmath322 of @xmath316 , @xmath323 , is called a `` measurable set '' or `` observable event , '' meaning that it is possible to assign a `` probability of occurrence , '' @xmath324 $ ] , for this event .",
    "hence , @xmath316 is said to be the set of ` observable events . '",
    "suppose now that we have a random function @xmath325 .",
    "if to every subset of @xmath314 of the form @xmath326 there corresponds an event @xmath327 , then the function @xmath98 is said to be _",

    "random variable_.    let us next consider the notion of an `` information flow . ''",
    "in a somewhat abstract way , we will represent the _ information _ available to an observer up to time @xmath42 as a @xmath96-algebra @xmath330 . in the context of finance ,",
    "the information set @xmath331 would contain , for instance , the price history up to time @xmath42 of all assets in the economy .",
    "it is natural to assume that @xmath332 for @xmath333 , since we expect that , as time goes on , we gain new information ( and do not discard the old ones ) .",
    "such a collection of @xmath96-algebras represents an `` information flow , '' or , more technically , a _",

    "the second property is the so - called _ law of iterated expectations _ , and basically represents the law of total probability .",
    "after these mathematical preliminaries , we are now in a position to define martingales .    a stochastic process @xmath355 is called a martingale with respect to the filtration @xmath356 if    1 .",

    "the defining property of a martingale is therefore condition ( iii ) , which is usually referred to as the _ martingale condition_. it says that the best prediction of future values of the process @xmath360 , contingent on the information available at the present time , is the current value @xmath361 .",
    "because of property ( iii ) , a martingale is usually described as a `` fair game . '' to see why this is so , suppose that @xmath362 represents the fortune of a gambler at time @xmath88 .",

    "indeed , the theory of stochastic integration is intimately connected with martingale theory @xcite .",
    "another important property of martingales is that their expected value remains constant in time : @xmath368=e[e[m_t|{\\cal f}_0]]=e[m_t],\\ ] ] where in first equality we used the martingale property , while in the second equality property ( [ eq : eey ] ) was used .",
    "thus , a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition for a process to be a martingale is that it have no drift .",
    "therefore , a diffusion process of the form ( [ eq : dx ] ) is not a martingales unless the drift term vanishes . for this reason ,",
    "the geometric brownian motion ( [ eq : geomb ] ) is not a martingale .",
    "it is possible , however , to introduce a new probability measure @xmath369 , with respect to which the geometric brownian motion becomes a standard brownian motion and hence a martingale , as discussed next .",

    "for this reason , the pricing method based on the equivalent martingale measure is commonly referred to as _ risk neutral valuation_. of course , actual investors are _ not _ risk neutral .",
    "however , in an efficient market there is a ` special reference frame ' where investors can be treated as if they were indeed insensitive to risk .",

    "mandelbrot @xcite in 1963 was perhaps the first person to challenge the paradigm that returns are normally distributed .",
    "he analyzed cotton prices on various exchanges in the united states and found evidences that their distribution of returns decays as a power law and hence much slower than a gaussian .",
    "an example of this ` fat tail ' behavior can be seen in fig .",

    ", it is also shown a gaussian distribution with the variance of the data , which appears as a parabola in the linear - log scale of the graph .",
    "one clearly sees that the empirical distribution does indeed have ` fatter tails ' when compared with the gaussian distribution .",
    "the gaussian distribution is special for two main reasons .",
    "the first one is the central limit theorem @xcite that states that the sum of infinitely many independent random variables ( with finite variance ) will converge to a gaussian variable .",
    "the second one is the fact that it is a _ stable _ distribution , in the sense that the sum of two independent gaussian random variables is also a gaussian variable .",
    "it is thus natural to ask whether there are other stable distributions .",
    "the french mathematician paul lvy showed that there is indeed a whole family of stable distributions of which the gaussian is but one particular case . in",

    "processes with infinite variance are not physically plausible , so several prescriptions to _ truncate _ the lvy distribution at some large scale has been proposed , as discussed next .      to circumvent the problem of infinite variance in lvy distributions ,",
    "several truncation prescriptions have been proposed in the literature . in a general",
    "they can be written as @xmath480 where @xmath307 is a cut - off function to be chosen in such way that the variance of the truncated distribution is finite .",
    "for example , two possible choices that have been used to model the distributions of financial asset prices are given below    @xmath463 abruptly truncated lvy distribution ( atld ) :    @xmath481 where @xmath482 is the heaviside function and @xmath483 is some cut - off length scale .",

    "since a truncated lvy distribution has finite variance , then by the central limit theorem the distribution of the sum @xmath486 of @xmath22 i.i.d  variables with such a distribution will converge to a gaussian distribution for large @xmath22",
    ". however , this convergence is usually very slow  for financial data it is typically of the order of tens of days ; see below . for shorter time scales ,",
    "non - gaussian behavior may thus be of practical relevance .",
    "lvy distribution have been used , for example , by mantegna & stanley @xcite to model the distribution of changes in the stock index s&p500 of the american stock exchange .",
    "they analyzed high - frequency data ( one - minute quotes of the s&p500 ) over the period from january 1984 to december 1989 . from the original time series @xmath487 of the index values , they first generated time series corresponding to index changes during intervals of @xmath22 minutes : @xmath488 they then computed the empirical pdf @xmath489 and analyzed the scaling of @xmath476 with @xmath22 . in a log - log plot",
    "@xmath476 showed a linear behavior , as predicted by ( [ eq : p0n ] ) , with a slope corresponding to @xmath490 for @xmath491 minutes @xcite .",
    "for @xmath492 the slope of @xmath476 approaches @xmath493 , indicating convergence to a gaussian behavior . in the lvy regime (",
    "i.e. , small @xmath22 ) , however , the tail of their empirical pdf decays slower than gaussian but faster than a pure lvy distribution with the exponent @xmath459 found from above scaling argument .",
    "these facts thus suggest that a truncated lvy distribution would perhaps be more appropriate for modeling the actual distribution .",
    "indeed , bouchaud and potters @xcite found that the probability of 15-minute changes of the s&p500 index is well described by a etld with @xmath494 .",
    "the etld has also been applied by miranda & riera @xcite to study the daily returns of ibovespa index of the so paulo stock exchange in the period 1986 - 2000 . from the daily closing values @xmath487 of the ibovespa , they first calculated the time series for the returns in intervals of @xmath22 days @xmath495 and then computed the corresponding pdf s for @xmath496 . from the scaling of @xmath476 they found @xmath497 for @xmath498 days , whereas for larger @xmath22 a gaussian - like behavior ( i.e. , @xmath499 ) was observed .",
    "many other applications of lvy processes in finance have been discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "for example , a model for option pricing has recently been considered where the price of the underlying asset is assumed to follow a truncated lvy process @xcite .",
    "more recently , there have accumulated evidences @xcite that in certain cases financial data may be better described by exponential distributions , rather than by lvy or gaussian distributions .",
    "in this section , we discuss the possibility that asset prices might exhibit long - range correlations and thus may need to be described in terms of long - memory processes , such as the fractional brownian motion .",
    "the fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) is a gaussian process @xmath500 with zero mean and stationary increments , whose variance and covariance are given by @xmath501=t^{2h } , \\label{eq : varbh}\\\\ & & e[w_h(s)w_h(t)]=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(s^{2h}+ t^{2h}-|t - s|^{2h}\\right ) , \\label{eq : corbh}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath502 . the fbm @xmath503 is a self - similar process , in the sense that @xmath504 for all @xmath145 .",
    "a sample path of a fbm is therefore a fractal curve with fractal dimension @xmath505 .",
    "the parameter @xmath506 is called the self - similarity exponent or the _",

    "thus , if @xmath511 the increments of the fbm are positively correlated and we say that the process @xmath503 exhibits persistence . likewise , for @xmath512 the increments are negatively correlated and the fbm is said to show antipersistence . sample fbm paths with @xmath513 and 0.8 are shown in fig .

    "the idea of using the fmb for modeling asset price dynamics dates back to the work of mandelbrot & van ness @xcite . since then , the hurst exponent has been calculated ( using different estimators ) for many financial time series , such as stock prices , stock indexes and currency exchange rates @xcite . in many cases",

    "the @xmath96-algebra @xmath596 contains the essential information about the structure of the random variable @xmath98 ; it contains all sets of the form @xmath597 .",
    "we also recall the definition of the probability distribution @xmath598 of a random variable @xmath98 : @xmath599 random variables can be either discrete , if the only assume a finite or countably number of values @xmath600 or continuous .",
    "most continuous distributions of interest have a density @xmath103 , i.e. , a function @xmath103 such that @xmath601 this allows us to compute the probability of a given event @xmath602 explicitly through the formula @xmath603          we usually think of the label @xmath42 as being time , so that @xmath337 would represent the ( random ) value of the quantity @xmath98 , say , the price of a risky asset or the position of a brownian particle , at time @xmath42 . for most of the cases , we consider @xmath14 to be the halfline @xmath605 . in this case",
    "we have a continuous - time process .",
    "eventually , we shall also consider discrete - time processes , in which case the variable @xmath42 assumes ( non - negative ) integer values , i.e. , @xmath606 .",

    "this function of time is called a _ realization _ , _ path _ , or _",
