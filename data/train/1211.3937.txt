    "psr j1906 + 0746 is a young pulsar in a 4-hr orbit around a massive companion @xcite . with a pulsar mass @xmath2m@xmath3 and a companion mass",
    "@xmath4m@xmath3 derived from timing measurement by @xcite , one can estimate the relativistic spin - precession period to be 165 years assuming general relativity .",
    "relativistic spin - precession in binary pulsars is a long - known effect that is due to spin - orbit coupling ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* damour & ruffini 1974 ; barker & oconnell 1975 ) ) .",
    "the consequence of this precession is that our line of sight crosses different parts of the radio beam with time .",
    "hence we can expect pulse shape and polarization variations .",
    "the non - detection of the interpulse in archival data and an increase of the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) for the main pulse between 1998 and 2005 , suggested the first sign of change in the beam orientation with respect to our line of sight @xcite .",
    "profile shape variations were also reported by @xcite when they presented their timing solution .",
    "more recently , they reported a preliminary beam map for the main pulse ( kasian 2012 ) .",
    "we present in these proceedings further observations that allow us to determine the geometry of the pulsar and produce improved maps of its radio beam .",
    "this pulsar was observed from 2005 to 2009 with the bon backend at the nanay radio telescope ( hereafter nrt ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* desvignes 2009 ) ) and the wapps , asp and gasp backends at the arecibo 305-m observatory and the green bank telescope respectively ( for further details , see kasian 2012 ) .",
    "all these observations were done at l - band .",
    "only the nrt observations provide calibrated full stokes profiles that were de - faradayed with a rotation measure of 149 rad m@xmath5 and hence were used for the polarimetric study . given the low snr of the nrt daily observations , the nrt profiles were integrated to form 13 profiles spanning 3 to 6 months to obtain reliable polarimetric fits .",
    "the mean pulse profile at the beginning of our dataset in 2005 consists of 2 sharp pulses separated by almost @xmath6 ( see fig . [ template ] ) . over the 3 years course of the data span , we measured a change in the separation of the two pulses to be @xmath7 .",
    "the flux density of both components was also estimated for each dataset using the radiometer equation , e.g. @xcite .",
    "it decreased by a factor of @xmath83 and @xmath84.5 for the main pulse and the interpulse respectively .",
    "our polarization data first confirmed the high degree of linear polarization noticed in the discovery paper @xcite .",
    "however the circular polarization under the main pulse gradually vanished between our first and last epochs .",
    "according to the rotating vector model ( rvm ) put forward by @xcite , the typical s curve of the polarization position angle ( ppa ) can be described in terms of the geometry of the pulsar :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the angle between the rotation and magnetic axis and @xmath11 denotes the impact parameter . here",
    "@xmath12 is the measured ppa at the longitude @xmath13 , @xmath14 the longitude under the magnetic axis at the closest approach of the line of sight and @xmath15 the ppa at the longitude @xmath14 .",
    "fitting the rvm to each of our 13 polarimetric profiles , we measured @xmath10 to be close to @xmath16 for all epochs . a constant value of @xmath10 is expected and this result strongly suggests an orthogonal rotator , with the two pulses representing the cone of emission of both magnetic poles .",
    "the rvm results also show a small increase of @xmath11 with time ( i.e. the slope of the ppa under the main pulse in decreasing with time ) , indicating that our line of sight is moving away from the magnetic poles .",
    "more importantly , a marginal decrease of @xmath15 is also detected .    in the next section",
    ", we used this change in @xmath15 to determine the geometry of the system and map the radio emission beams .",
    "@xcite have shown that the absolute value of the ppa @xmath15 should change with time . applying their global precession model and fitting for the magnetic inclination angle @xmath10 , the misalignment angle @xmath17 , the reference precessional phase @xmath18 plus the 13 phase offsets give the results reported in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the magnetic inclination angle is consistent with the value determined with the simple rvm fit .",
    "the large value of the misalignment angle explains our quick detection of the precession effects .",
    "its large uncertainty can be justified by the fact that the impact parameter did not have a sign reversal as it happened for psr j1141@xmath196545 @xcite .",
    "with the geometry of the system derived , we can now produce a map of the emission beam .",
    "first , a set of gaussians is fitted to all profiles .",
    "the height of the gaussians are normalized using flux density measurements .",
    "when producing the beam map for psr j1141@xmath196545 , manchester ( 2010 ) aligned the pulse profiles using the edges . in this work , the profiles are aligned with respect to the magnetic poles based on the individual measurements of @xmath20 given by the simple rvm fits , hence making no assumption on the beam shape .",
    "this alignment based on polarimetric results explains the offset in the main pulse longitude between this beam map and the one produced by @xcite .",
    "the results of the beam maps are shown fig .",
    "[ beams ] . in the case of the main pulse ,",
    "we see axial emission with the flux decreasing as the line of sight is moving away from the magnetic pole . for the interpulse",
    ", the emission is more extended .",
    "the beam maps clearly show the change in the separation of the two components as the line of sight is moving away from the magnetic poles .",
    "these profile variations will undoubtedly have an impact on the timing study of this pulsar ( van leeuwen in prep . ) beyond the usual timing noise in young pulsars @xcite ."
