    "<S> we investigate the dynamical self - energy corrections of the electron - hole plasma due to electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions at the band edges of a quasi - one dimensional ( 1d ) photoexcited electron - hole plasma . </S>",
    "<S> the leading - order @xmath0 dynamical screening approximation is used in the calculation by treating electron - electron coulomb interaction and electron - optical phonon frhlich interaction on an equal footing . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the exchange - correlation induced band gap renormalization ( bgr ) as a function of the electron - hole plasma density and the quantum wire width . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated bgr shows good agreement with existing experimental results , and the bgr normalized by the effective quasi-1d excitonic rydberg exhibits an approximate one - parameter universality .    </S>",
    "<S> pacs number : 73.20.dx ; 71.35.ee ; 71.45.gm ; 78.55.cr    a highly dense electron - hole plasma ( ehp ) can be generated in a wide variety of semiconductors by optical pumping . </S>",
    "<S> the band structure and the optical properties of highly excited semiconductors differ from those calculated for noninteracting electron - hole pairs due to many - body exchange - correlation effects arising from the ehp@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one of the important many - body effects in high density ehp is a density - dependent renormalization of the fundamental band gap of the semiconductor , which causes an increasing absorption in the spectral region below the lowest exciton resonance . </S>",
    "<S> the exchange - correlation correction of the fundamental band gap due to the presence of free carriers ( electrons in the conduction band and holes in the valence band ) in the system is referred to as the band gap renormalization ( bgr ) effect . </S>",
    "<S> optical nonlinearities , which are strongly influenced by coulomb interaction in the ehp , are typically associated with the band - gap renormalization phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> the band gap renormalization has been widely studied in bulk and quasi - two dimensional ( quantum well ) semiconductors @xcite . in recent years , </S>",
    "<S> quasi - one dimensional semiconductor quantum wires ( qw ) have been fabricated with atomic scale definition , and qw optical properties have been studied for their potential device applications such as semiconductor lasers . </S>",
    "<S> there has , however , been little work on the bgr in qw systems , both experimentally @xcite and theoretically@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so far most calculations have been done in the static screening approximation or in the simple plasmon - pole approximation , which is a simplified version of the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) . </S>",
    "<S> the plasmon - pole approximation consists of ignoring the weight in the single particle excitations and assuming that all free carrier contributions to the dynamical dielectric function lies at the effective plasma frequency @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the advantages of the plasmon - pole approximation are its mathematical simplicity and simple physical meaning . however , a certain degree of arbitrariness in the choice of the effective plasmon pole parameters which are needed to satisfy the @xmath2-sum rule and the static kramers - kroning relation leads to considerable difficulties in applying the theory to semiconductors with complex band structures . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the bgr of the quantum wire structures based on the rpa dynamical screening @xmath0 scheme by taking into account the full frequency dependent dielectric response in the _ two component _ one dimensional ( 1d ) ehp .    </S>",
    "<S> most high quality qw structures of our interest are fabricated in weakly polar iii - v semiconductors . in a polar semiconductor , </S>",
    "<S> free carriers couple to the longitudinal optical ( lo)-phonons of the underlying lattice through the long - range polar frhlich interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the carrier - lo phonon interaction leads to polaronic many - body renormalization of the single particle free carrier properties . </S>",
    "<S> even though the weakly polar iii - v materials have rather small frhlich coupling constants , the electronic properties can still be substantially modified by the frhlich interaction . </S>",
    "<S> thus , inclusion of dynamical electron - phonon interaction in the theory is important since in the quantum well wires made of weakly polar materials frhlich interaction produces observable many - body corrections . in spite of substantial current interest in the properties of polar quasi - one dimensional qw systems existing in gaas quantum wires , </S>",
    "<S> the full many - body problem that includes dynamical screening and treats electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions on equal footing has not yet been worked out .    our goal is to calculate the bgr of a coupled 1d electron - phonon many - body system treating electrons and phonons on an equal footing . </S>",
    "<S> there has been no detailed quantitative study of 1d quasiparticle properties including both electron  electron and electron  phonon interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we provide such an analysis in this article based on the leading - order many - body perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the self - energy corrections to the band edges ( the highest valence- and the lowest conduction - band edges ) in the presence of the ehp density @xmath3 of the electrons ( @xmath4 ) and the holes(@xmath5 ) for quantum well wires of various thicknesses and for a number of different semiconductor systems . to the best of our knowledge , </S>",
    "<S> this is the first calculation of electronic many - body bgr correction in qw systems including full effects of both the dynamical electron - electron and frhlich electron  lo - phonon interactions treated on an equal footing . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the calculated bgr using the full rpa dielectric function agrees very well with available experimental results @xcite and depends on both the electron - hole density and quantum wire widths . </S>",
    "<S> our calculated bgr in quantum wires shows an approximate materials independent two - parameter universality as a function of the _ scaled _ plasma density and wire width . </S>",
    "<S> we find that this two - parameter universality of the bgr can be reduced to a single universal curve when the bgr scaled in the units of the appropriate quasi-1d effective excitonic rydberg is expressed as a function of the dimensionless 1d electron - hole density parameter , @xmath6 with a plasma density @xmath7 and an effective bohr radius @xmath8 .    </S>",
    "<S> we assume that our quasi-1d qw system has an infinite square - well confinement with a finite width ( @xmath9 ) in the y - direction and zero thickness in the z - direction , which is one of the simplest 1d confinement models . </S>",
    "<S> because of the universality mentioned above we believe that our results are valid for more general 1d confinement situations . </S>",
    "<S> only one kind of electrons and holes with isotropic , parabolic dispersion in a direct gap semiconductor is assumed to exist , thus neglecting most of the band - structure complications of the valence subbands . </S>",
    "<S> this should be an adequate approximation for calculating the band edge bgr . </S>",
    "<S> we consider here the @xmath10 situation with only the lowest conduction subband ( for the electrons ) and the highest valence subband ( for the holes ) occupied . </S>",
    "<S> the effective mass approximation is expected to be fairly well - valid under the experimental conditions and we will assume that uncritically for our theory . </S>",
    "<S> our main calculations use the @xmath0 approximation for the self - energy@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is the leading term in an iterative expansion of the self - energy operator in powers of the dynamically screened effective electron - electron ( including both coulomb and frhlich couplings ) interaction @xmath11 , and has been shown to yield an excellent description of quasiparticle energies in semiconductors @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the bgr is given by the sum of the self - energies for electrons and holes at band edges @xmath12 the total electronic self - energy within the leading order effective dynamical interaction in a two - component electron - hole plasma is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the green s function for the noninteracting electron gas , @xmath15 the total effective interaction , and @xmath16 the effective dynamical dielectric function . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are the direct coulomb interaction , the lo - phonon mediated electron  electron interaction , and the irreducible 1d noninteracting polarizability , respectively . in our extreme quantum limit model where only the lowest 1d subband is occupied by the electrons , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the interaction matrix elements by taking the quantizing confinement potential to be of infinite square well type@xcite and the lo - phonon mediated electron  </S>",
    "<S> electron interaction is dependent on wave vector and frequency , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the effective 1d frhlich interaction matrix element and @xmath22 the unperturbed retarded bare lo - phonon propagator @xcite . since </S>",
    "<S> our system is a two - component system ( electron - hole plasma ) , the polarizability function is a sum of electron and hole polarizabilities , @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> the formalism for holes , within our parabolic band approximation , is the same as that for electrons and the only modification needed in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sigma ] ) is the substitution of @xmath24 by @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the self - energy calculation is standard and more details can be found in the literature @xcite .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] we show our calculated exchange - correlation - induced band gap renormalization for quasi-1d quantum wires , which is scaled by the effective 3d rydberg , @xmath26 , as a function of the effective electron - hole plasma density parameter , @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> we also show in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] the band gap renormalization for various quantum wire widths </S>",
    "<S> . the bgr increases with decreasing wire width . </S>",
    "<S> the qw bgr depends rather strongly on the wire width because the 1d coulomb interaction matrix element is a sensitive function of the width even in the long wavelength limit . </S>",
    "<S> we have carried out the calculation of bgr as a function of carrier density and wire width for a number of iii - v semiconductor materials . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , when expressed in suitable dimensionless units ( the effective 3d rydberg and the effective 1d density parameter @xmath28 ) as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] , the band gap renormalization in quasi-1d systems is an approximate two - parameter universal function , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , a universal function of the effective density and the wire confinement width . </S>",
    "<S> ( since the lowest exciton state is not well defined in the ideal zero width limit of the 1d electron - hole system @xcite , we use the effective 3d rydberg to scale the band gap renormalization . ) the inset in the fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] shows the bgr for the quasi-1d _ gaas - algaas _ system as a function of the electron - hole plasma density @xmath7 together with the available experimental data from ref . </S>",
    "<S> , in which the bgr is measured in confined quantum well structures with lateral widths of @xmath29 </S>",
    "<S> . for gaas we use the parameters @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and the background dielectric constant @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the calculated bgr using the full rpa dielectric function agrees well with available experimental data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> better quantitative agreement between experiment and theory may require a finite temperature calculation including higher subband filling effects , which have been neglected in this calculation .    in bulk semiconductors </S>",
    "<S> the exchange - correlation energy is essentially independent @xcite of band - structure details when expressed in appropriate dimensionless units . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a universal form for the bgr when the self - energy corrections and the carrier density are expressed in appropriate rescaled units of the effective excitonic rydberg and the normalized interparticle separation @xmath28 , respectively @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a similar universality holds for two dimensional ( 2d ) systems when the band gap is expressed in effective 2d rydberg and the electron - hole density in the 2d @xmath28 parameter@xcite . in quasi-2d quantum well systems , however , the bgr depends on the well width and is found to be a two - parameter universal function of the effective 2d @xmath28 parameter and well width . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown @xcite that this two - parameter universality can be reduced to an approximate one - parameter universality by choosing suitable _ quasi_-2d bohr radius and effective rydberg as the effective length and energy scaling units , respectively . in order to investigate whether the two - parameter universality of quasi-1d bgr in fig . [ fig1 ] can be reduced to a one - parameter universality by suitably rescaling energy and length units </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the quasi-1d exciton binding energy , which would be used as a suitable energy rescaling unit . </S>",
    "<S> the exciton energy of the quasi-1d system has earlier been calculated in the cylindrical wire with a finite radius smaller than the bulk exciton radius @xcite . however , in order to be consistent with our bgr calculation we use the quasi-1d coulomb interaction of the quantum wire with a zero thickness in @xmath33-direction and a finite width @xmath9 in @xmath34-direction to calculate the 1d excitonic binding energy within our confinement model . in this approximation and within the one subband extreme quantum limit the effective quasi-1d coulomb interaction is given by @xmath35 where </S>",
    "<S> @xmath36 is the 2d coulomb potential and @xmath37 is the single particle wave function in the unperturbed quantum well wire with infinite barriers . </S>",
    "<S> the fourier transform of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ vq1d ] ) is used as the bare coulomb interaction to calculate the self - energy of the electron - hole plasma in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sigma ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> if we neglect the motion of carriers in y - direction , the relative motion of a quasi-1d electron - hole pair is described by the 1d schrdinger equation with the effective quasi-1d coulomb interaction given in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ vq1d ] ) . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] we show our numerically calculated two lowest excitonic binding energies @xmath38 for a _ gaas - algaas _ quantum well wire as a function of the width @xmath9 ( the ground state @xmath39 and the first excited state @xmath40 ) . comparing with the measured exciton energy ( @xmath41 mev ) for a gaas quantum wire with the lateral width @xmath42 @xmath43@xcite </S>",
    "<S> , our calculation gives reasonable agreement . </S>",
    "<S> using the calculated effective exciton binding energy ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ) we rescale the calculated qw band gap renormalization to investigate the applicability of a one - parameter qw bgr universality . in fig . </S>",

    "<S> quasi_-1d effective parameters produces an approximate one - parameter universality . </S>",
    "<S> ( note that we use the 3d bohr radius @xmath8 to rescale the lengths . ) in order to check the general applicability of our universal bgr results , experimental data on different iii - v quasi-1d semiconductor qw systems are needed . </S>",
    "<S> it would be interesting to verify our predicted one parameter bgr universality by measuring the bgr in different iii - v materials for qw of different widths .    in conclusion </S>",
