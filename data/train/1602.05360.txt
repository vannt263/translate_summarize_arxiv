    ".    these exact results in quenched approximation then allow us to establish that the ir fermion physics , even in the absence of landau damping , is already that of a non - fermi liquid .",

    "the green s function behaves as @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the dispersion velocity of the boson ; around the two split - off fermi surfaces behaves as @xmath32 with @xmath33 an emergent dispersion velocity @xmath34 .",

    "we will show here through exact results that the minimal theory in eq",
    ".   already has a very non - trivial ir .",
    "we shall comment on the relevance of @xmath41 to our results below .",
    "( 2 ) from a wilsonian point of view , self - interactions of the boson should also be included .",
    "we leave the effect of this term for future investigations and take the action @xmath42 as given from here on and study it on its own .-",
    "dimensional , the properties of fermionic field are still strongly dependent on the dimensionality of the system , because the fermions interact with the @xmath43-dimensional boson . an instructive way to think about the fermion dynamics in dimensions parallel to the fermi surface , is to fourier transform in those directions . because the kinetic term does not depend on these directions , the parallel momenta act as additional global quantum numbers .",
    "e.g. in @xmath0 , one therefore has an infinite set of one - dimensional fermionic subsystems , labeled by @xmath26 .",
    "the yukawa interaction with the bosons then describes the interactions between these many one - dimensional subsystems . ]    throughout the paper we are mostly interested in the case where the characteristic speed @xmath44 of the critical bosonic excitations is larger than the fermi velocity , @xmath45 . this need not be the case in the uv .",
