    "a diquark is a bosonic quark - quark correlation , which is necessarily coloured in all but @xmath0-colour qcd ( qc@xmath1d ) .",
    "therefore , in the presence of colour - confinement , diquarks can not be directly observed in a @xmath7 colour gauge theory s spectrum .",
    "nevertheless evidence is accumulating that suggests confined diquark correlations play an important role in hadronic spectroscopy and interactions .    the first discussion of diquark correlations in literature addressing the strong interaction is almost coincident with that of quarks themselves  @xcite .",
    "it was quickly realised that both lorentz scalar and vector diquarks , at least , are important for baryon spectroscopy  @xcite and , from a consideration of baryon magnetic moments  @xcite , that the diquark correlations are not pointlike .",
    "this latter point is still often overlooked , although with decreasing frequency and now certainly without the imputation that it is a realistic simplification .",
    "the motivation for considering diquarks in the constituent - quark model is that treating baryons directly as a three - body problem poses significant challenges in anything other than a mean - field approach .",
    "the task is much simplified if two of the constituents can be replaced by a single degree of freedom . however , an obvious question is whether there is any sense in which that replacement is more than just an expedient ; i.e. , a sense in which it captures some important aspect of qcd s dynamics ?",
    "the answer is `` yes '' and we now turn to explaining that .    a significant step toward a description of baryons in quantum field theory can be identified in the realisation  @xcite that a large class of field theoretical models of the strong interaction admit the construction of a meson - diquark auxiliary - field effective action and thereby a description of baryons as loosely - bound quark - diquark composites .",
    "this is the class of theories with a chiral symmetry preserving four - fermion interaction , which includes , e.g. , the nambu  jona - lasinio model  @xcite and the global colour model  @xcite , that have been widely used in analysing low energy strong interaction phenomena .",
    "the picture of a baryon as loosely bound quark - diquark composite can also be reached via a direct analysis of the bound state contributions to the three quark scattering matrix .",
    "the associated schwinger function ( euclidean green function ) is just that quantity whose large euclidean - time behaviour yields a baryon s mass in numerical simulations of lattice - qcd .",
    "considering the colour structure of this schwinger function , we focus on the clebsch - gordon series for quarks in the fundamental representation of @xmath8 : @xmath9 from which it is clear that a _ colour singlet _ @xmath10-quark contribution is only possible when two of the quarks are combined to transform according to the _ antitriplet _ , @xmath11 , representation .",
    "this is the representation under which antiquarks transform .",
    "single gluon exchange is repulsive in the @xmath12 channel but attractive in the @xmath11 channel .",
    "it is this feature that underpins the existence of the meson - diquark bosonisation referred to above .",
    "one way to see that is to realise that the auxiliary field effective action obtained for any element of the class of four - fermion interaction models provides a lagrangian realisation of the rainbow - ladder truncation of the dyson - schwinger equations ( dses )  @xcite . the rainbow - ladder truncation has been widely and successfully employed in the study of meson spectroscopy and interactions , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite , and nonpointlike colour - antitriplet diquark bound states exist in this truncation of the quark - quark bethe - salpeter equation ( bse )  @xcite .",
    "hence they provide a real degree of freedom to be used in the bosonisation .    at first sight the existence of colour - antitriplet diquark bound states in these models , and in the rainbow - ladder truncation , appears to be a problem because such states are not observed in the qcd spectrum .",
    "however , as demonstrated in refs .",
    "@xcite , this apparent lack of confinement is primarily an artefact of the rainbow - ladder truncation .",
    "higher order terms in the quark - quark scattering kernel , the crossed - box and vertex corrections , whose analogue in the quark - antiquark channel do not much affect many of the colour singlet meson channels , act to ensure that the quark - quark scattering matrix does not exhibit the singularities that correspond to asymptotic ( unconfined ) diquark bound states .",
    "nevertheless , such studies with improved kernels , which do not produce diquark bound states , do support a physical interpretation of the `` spurious '' rainbow - ladder diquark masses . denoting the mass in a given diquark channel ( scalar , pseudovector , etc . ) by @xmath13 , then @xmath14 represents the range over which a true diquark correlation in this channel can persist _ inside _ a baryon . in this sense",
    "they are `` pseudo - particle '' masses that can be used to estimate which @xmath11 diquark correlations should dominate the bound state contribution to the three quark scattering matrix , and hence which should be retained in deriving and solving a poincar covariant homogeneous fadde@xmath15ev equation for baryons .    the simple goldstone - theorem - preserving rainbow - ladder kernel of ref .",
    "@xcite can be used to illustrate this point .",
    "the model yields the following calculated diquark masses ( isospin symmetry is assumed ) : @xmath16 and the results are relevant because the mass ordering is characteristic and model - independent , and lattice estimates , where available  @xcite , agree with the masses tabulated here .",
    "equation  ( [ diquarkmasses ] ) suggests that an accurate study of the nucleon should retain the scalar and pseudovector correlations : @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , because for these diquarks @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the nucleon mass , but may neglect other correlations .",
    "furthermore , it is obvious from the angular momentum clebsch - gordon series : @xmath23 and @xmath24 , that decuplet baryons are inaccessible without pseudovector diquark correlations .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath25  cf .",
    "@xmath26 and hence one might anticipate that the presence of diquark correlations in baryons can provide a straightforward explanation of the @xmath27-@xmath28 mass - splitting and other like effects .",
    "these ideas were first enunciated in refs .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite provides a convincing demonstration of their efficacy .",
    "explicit calculations ; e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite , show that retaining only a scalar diquark correlation in the kernel of the nucleon s fadde@xmath15ev equation provides insufficient binding to obtain the experimental nucleon mass : the best calculated value is typically @xmath29% too large .",
    "however , with the addition of a pseudovector diquark it is easy to simultaneously obtain  @xcite the experimental masses of the nucleon and @xmath28 .",
    "such calculations plainly verify the intuition that follows from simple mass - counting : the pseudovector diquarks are an important but subdominant element of the nucleon s fadde@xmath15ev amplitude ( cf .  the scalar diquark ) whilst being the sole component of the @xmath28 .",
    "the presence of diquark correlations in baryons also affects the predictions for scattering observables , which may therefore provide a means for experimentally verifying the ideas described above .",
    "for example , their presence provides a simple explanation of the neutron s nonzero electric form factor  @xcite : charge separation arising from a heavy @xmath30 diquark with electric charge @xmath31 holding on to a relatively light , electric charge @xmath32 @xmath33-quark . and also a prediction for the ratio of the proton s valence - quark distributions : @xmath34 , which can be measured in deep inelastic scattering  @xcite . in this case ,",
    "diquark correlations with differing masses in the nucleon s fadde@xmath15ev amplitude are an immediate indication of the breaking of @xmath35 symmetry , hence @xmath36 .",
    "furthermore , if it were true that @xmath37 , for all @xmath38 , then @xmath39 .",
    "however , as we have seen , in reality the @xmath40 diquark is an important subdominant piece of the nucleon s fadde@xmath15ev amplitude so that a realistic picture of diquarks in the nucleon implies @xmath41 , with the actual value being a sensitive measure of the proton s pseudovector diquark fraction .",
    "we have outlined above the role and nature of diquark correlations in hadronic physics at zero temperature and density , and emphasised that diquarks are an idea as old as that of quarks themselves .",
    "another phenomenon suggested immediately by the meson - diquark auxiliary - field effective action is that of diquark condensation ; i.e. , quark - quark cooper pairing , which was first explored in this context using a simple version of the nambu  jona - lasinio model  @xcite .",
    "a chemical potential promotes cooper pairing in fermion systems and the possibility that such diquark pairing is exhibited in quark matter is also an old idea , early explorations of which employed  @xcite the rainbow - ladder truncation of the quark dse ( qcd gap equation ) .",
    "that interest in this possibility has been renewed is evident in a number of contributions to this volume  @xcite .",
    "a quark - quark cooper pair is a composite boson with both electric and colour charge , and hence superfluidity in quark matter entails superconductivity and colour superconductivity .",
    "however , the last feature makes it difficult to identify an order parameter that can characterise a transition to the superfluid phase : the cooper pair is gauge dependent and an order parameter is ideally describable by a gauge - invariant operator .",
    "this particularly inhibits an analysis of the phenomenon using lattice - qcd .",
    "studies of the gap equation that suppress the possibility of diquark condensation show that cold , sparse two - flavour qcd exhibits a nonzero quark - antiquark condensate : @xmath42 . if it were otherwise then the @xmath43-meson would be almost as massive as the @xmath44-meson , which would yield a very different observable world .",
    "the quark condensate is undermined by increasing @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and there is a large domain in the physical ( upper - right ) quadrant of the @xmath47-plane for which @xmath48 : for the purpose of exemplification , that domain can crudely be characterised as the set ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath49    increasing temperature also opposes cooper pairing . however , since increasing @xmath45 promotes it , there may be a ( large-@xmath45,low-@xmath46)-subdomain in which quark matter exists in a superfluid phase .",
    "that domain , if it exists , is unlikely to be accessible at the relativistic heavy ion collider , because it operates in the high temperature regime , but may be realised in the core of compact astrophysical objects , which could undergo a transition to superfluid quark matter as they cool .",
    "possible signals accompanying such a transition are considered in refs .",

    "therefore , as observed in refs .",
    "@xcite , the bag constant can be identified as the pressure difference between the @xmath134 vacuum , the so - called nambu - goldstone phase in which chiral symmetry is dynamically broken , and the chirally symmetric no - condensate alternative , which is called the wigner - weyl vacuum .",

    "( [ rlresults ] ) , and @xmath201 the last result shows , unsurprisingly , that the nambu - goldstone phase is favoured at @xmath55 . _ precluding _ diquark condensation , the solution of the vertex - corrected gap equation exhibits coincident , first order chiral symmetry restoring and deconfinement transitions at @xmath202    admitting diquark condensation , however , the @xmath45-dependence of the bag constants again shows there is a first order transition to the superfluid phase , here at @xmath203 ( nb .",
    "this discussion is still for @xmath92 .",
    "we saw at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : nc2 ] what effects to anticipate at @xmath101 . )",
    "thus the material step of employing a truncation that eliminates diquark bound states leads only to small quantitative changes in the quantities characterising the still extant superfluid phase ; e.g. , reductions in the magnitude of both the critical chemical potential for the transition to superfluid quark matter and the gap .",
    "hence scalar diquark condensation appears to be a robust phenomenon .",
    "one caveat to bear in mind , however , is that the gap equation studies conducted hitherto do not obviate the question of whether the diquark condensed phase is stable with - respect - to dinucleon condensation  @xcite , which requires further attention .",
    "heating causes the diquark condensate to evaporate .",
    "existing studies suggest that it will disappear for @xmath204@xmath205mev  @xcite .",
    "however , such temperatures are high relative to that anticipated inside dense astrophysical objects , which may indeed therefore provide an environment for detecting quark matter superfluidity .",
    "the idea that diquark correlations play an important role in strong interaction physics is an old one .",
    "however , modern computational resources and theoretical techniques make possible a more thorough and quantitative exploration of the merits of this idea and its realisation in qcd .",
    "these advances are in part responsible for the contemporary resurgence of interest in all aspects of diquark - related phenomena .",
    "the gap equation is a primary tool in all studies of pairing . using the special case of @xmath0-colour qcd ,",
    "qc@xmath1d , we illustrated via an analysis of the gap equation how a nonzero chemical potential promotes cooper pairing and how that pairing can overwhelm a source for quark - antiquark condensation , such as a fermion current - mass .",
    "as we saw , the pseudoreality of @xmath206 entails that qc@xmath1d has a number of special symmetry properties , which dramatically affect the spectrum .    turning to qcd itself",
    ", we saw that one can expect a nonzero quark condensate at zero chemical potential : @xmath3 , to give way to a diquark condensate when the chemical potential exceeds @xmath207 , and at this point the diquark gap is @xmath5 .",
    "the diquark condensate melts when the temperature exceeds @xmath208@xmath209mev ; i.e. , one - third to one - half of the chiral symmetry restoring temperature in two - flavour qcd .",
    "these features are model - independent in the sense that the many , disparate models applied recently to the problem yield results in semi - quantitative agreement .",
