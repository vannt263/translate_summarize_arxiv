    "according to the theory of strong interactions , the quantum chromo dynamics ( qcd ) , hadrons are bound objects of quarks and gluons .",
    "the properties of hadrons in vacuum are well known and confirmed by lattice qcd calculations @xcite while the properties of hadrons in a strongly interacting environment are subject of intensive research .",
    "qcd inspired approaches as well as phenomenological models based on phase shifts and su(3 ) symmetry @xcite predict significant changes of hadron properties in a strongly interacting medium .",
    "the results of the different models vary substantially .",
    "it is therefore one of the challenges of novel experimental heavy - ion physics to study these in - medium modifications of hadrons . besides the in - medium properties of the antikaon , interesting also for astrophysical reasons ,",
    "the vector mesons and especially the @xmath12 meson have been in the focus of the theoretical interest because the @xmath12 has the quantum numbers of a photon and can therefore disintegrate into an electron - positron pair .",
    "having only electromagnetic interactions this pair may easily leave the reaction region without further collisions .",
    "this allows to reconstruct the invariant mass of the decaying @xmath13 .",
    "thus there is a hope that by measuring the dilepton invariant mass spectra the in - medium mass and width of the @xmath12 meson become experimentally accessible . for this",
    "it is necessary to separate the background from known dilepton sources  dalitz decays of baryonic and mesonic resonances as well as @xmath9 and @xmath5 bremsstrahlung . at sps energies of 40 and 158",
    "@xmath0gev such an enhancement above the known background has been measured by the ceres @xcite and the na60 @xcite collaborations .",
    "the experimental results are compatible with the assumption that in the medium the peak position of the @xmath12 meson mass distribution remains rather unchanged while the width increases considerably ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    at much lower energies , at energies around 1 @xmath0gev dileptons",
    "have been measured in heavy - ion collisions at the bevalac in berkeley by the dls collaboration @xcite .",
    "these data led to the so called dls puzzle because the dls dilepton yield in c+c and ca+ca collisions in the invariant mass range from 0.2 to 0.5 gev @xcite was about five times higher than the results from different transport models at that time using the conventional dilepton sources such as bremsstrahlung , @xmath14 and @xmath6 dalitz decays and direct decay of vector mesons ( @xmath15 ) @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy remained even after including in the transport calculations the different scenarios for the in - medium modifications of vector meson properties , as dropping mass or collisional broadening of the @xmath12 and @xmath16 spectral functions @xcite . to solve this puzzle was one of the main motivations to build the hades ( high acceptance dilepton spectrometer ) detector at gsi in germany @xcite . in 2008",
    "the hades collaboration confirmed the dls data @xcite for c+c at 1.0 @xmath0gev . in the mean time also the theoretical transport approaches as well as effective models for the elementary @xmath17 reactions have been further developed . as it has been suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , the dls puzzle can be solved when incorporating stronger @xmath4 and @xmath3 bremsstrahlung contributions in line with the updated one - boson - exchange ( obe ) model calculations from @xcite .",
    "the previous obe approaches @xcite used in the old transport calculations for the analysis of the dls data , gave results close to the soft photon approximation .",
    "as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite the results of the hsd model ( off - shell microscopic hadron - string - dynamics ( hsd ) transport approach ) with enhanced bremsstrahlung cross sections agree very well with the hades experimental data for c+c at 1 and 2 @xmath0gev as well as with the dls data for c+c and ca+ca at 1 @xmath0gev , especially when one includes a collisional broadening in the vector - meson spectral functions .",
    "similar results have been obtained by other , independent transport approaches  iqmd @xcite and the rossendorf buu @xcite .    despite of the fact that theory predicts that the vector meson properties are modified substantially already at energies as low as 1 - 2 @xmath0gev",
    ", it is quite difficult to observe these changes experimentally .",
    "the production yield of @xmath13 and @xmath18 mesons is small at these energies and the background from other dilepton sources like @xmath6-dalitz decay and @xmath9 bremsstrahlung is large in the mass range of interest , @xmath19 gev .",
    "therefore the presently available data do not allow for a detailed investigation of the in - medium properties of vector mesons .",
    "this focuses the interest of the present studies to the question whether the invariant mass spectrum below the @xmath20 peak depends on the system size and on the beam energy in a non - trivial way , i.e. whether the dilepton invariant mass spectra can be understood as a superposition of individual @xmath3 and @xmath4 interactions . in a first publication @xcite the hades collaboration found that the invariant mass spectra of dileptons , observed in 1 and 2 @xmath0gev c+c collisions , are practically coincident below @xmath21 gev if divided by the total number of observed @xmath22 and after subtracting the @xmath23 dalitz decay contribution",
    "it is strongly suppressed at 1 @xmath0gev but becomes essential at 2 @xmath0gev due to the kinematical threshold for the @xmath23 production in @xmath17 collisions .",
    "this scaling with the @xmath22 number can be interpreted as a scaling with the number of participants @xmath24 .",
    "the hades collaboration , comparing the dilepton yield from the light c+c",
    "systems with the elementary @xmath3 and @xmath25 interactions , albeit taken at different energies , has concluded that the dilepton invariant mass spectra in these light systems can be considered as a mere superposition of @xmath4 and @xmath3 collisions without any in - medium enhancement .    in a more recent publication @xcite a heavier system , ar+kcl at 1.75 @xmath0gev ,",
    "was investigated and the collaboration came to the conclusion that in this reaction the dilepton invariant mass yield between 0.2 and 0.6 gev is about 2 - 3 times larger than expected from a mere superposition of @xmath3 and @xmath4 collisions @xcite . from the analysis of the excess in the transverse - mass slope and from the angular anisotropies",
    "the hades collaboration concluded that the excess of dileptons in the low invariant mass region scales with the system size very differently than the freeze - out yield of pions and @xmath23 and that the data are compatible with the assumption that they originate from @xmath6 dalitz decays , being suggestive of resonance matter @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of the present study to investigate this enhancement within the presently available transport codes  hsd , iqmd and urqmd  in order to explore whether the dilepton production in these systems can be reproduced by the theoretical approaches and to identify eventually the origin of this in - medium enhancement .",
    "all these codes have been successfully employed to investigate a multitude of experimental observables .",
    "they are , however , not of the same sophistication as far as the dileptons are concerned .",
    "the dilepton part of the urqmd program is still under development and up to now bremsstrahlung is not included .",
    "this limits the predictive power to parts of the spectra where bremsstrahlung is not essential . for the study of the in - medium enhancement we limit ourselves to hsd and iqmd calculations .",
    "we start out in section ii with a short description of the hsd model and of the improvements made compared to the standard hsd 2.5 version used for the extended dilepton study in ref . @xcite .",

    "we use only the bremsstrahlung contribution from @xcite avoiding the uncertainties in the @xmath6 channel in the obe models and neglecting the quantum mechanical interference between individual contributions which can not be treated consistently in transport approaches .",

    "the experimental enhancement is , however , plagued partly by the use of @xmath25 collisions instead of @xmath4 collisions because in the interesting kinematical regime the @xmath25 collisions are true three - body collisions and can not be interpreted as quasi - free @xmath4 reactions .",
    "so the true enhancement  as compared to elementary collisions  can not be inferred from present data for invariant masses above 0.5 gev .",

    "this cycle produces a number of generations of @xmath6 s during the reaction which increases with the size of the system . at the end",

    "accordingly , the dilepton data from @xmath27 reactions shed light on the @xmath6 dynamics in the medium .    in the investigated invariant mass range , @xmath263 gev , we do not find evidence that the observed enhancement of the dilepton yield in heavy - ion collisions over the elementary reactions requires the assumption of conventional in - medium effects like a modification of the spectral functions of the involved hadrons .",
    "theory predicts such a modification for vector mesons and therefore for invariant masses @xmath198 gev . more precise data are needed to draw robust conclusions on the in - medium modifications in this invariant mass range .",

    "<S> we study the dilepton production in heavy - ion collisions at energies of 1 - 2 @xmath0gev as well as in proton induced @xmath1 and @xmath2 reactions from 1 gev up to 3.5 gev where data have been taken by the hades collaboration . </S>",
    "<S> for the analysis we employ three different transport models - the microscopic off - shell hadron - string - dynamics ( hsd ) transport approach , the isospin quantum molecular dynamics ( iqmd ) approach as well as the ultra - relativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( urqmd ) approach . we find that the hsd and iqmd models describe very reasonably the elementary @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 reactions despite of different assumptions on quantities like the excitation function of the @xmath6 multiplicity , where solid experimental constraints are not available . </S>",
    "<S> taking these data on elementary collisions as input , the three models provide a good description of the presently available heavy ion data . in particular , we confirm the experimentally observed enhancement of the dilepton yield ( normalized to the multiplicity of neutral pions @xmath7 ) in heavy - ion collisions with respect to that measured in @xmath8 collisions . </S>",
    "<S> we identify two contributions to this enhancement : a ) the @xmath9 bremsstrahlung which scales with the number of collisions and not with the number of participants , i.e. pions ; b ) the dilepton emission from intermediate @xmath6 s which are part of the reaction cycles @xmath10 and @xmath11 . with increasing system size more </S>",
    "<S> generations of intermediate @xmath6 s are created . </S>",
    "<S> if such @xmath6 decays into a pion , the pion can be reabsorbed , however , if it decays into a dilepton , the dilepton escapes from the system . </S>",
    "<S> thus , experimentally one observes only one pion ( from the last produced @xmath6 ) whereas the dilepton yield accumulates the contributions from all @xmath6 s of the cycle . </S>",
    "<S> we show as well that the fermi motion enhances the production of pions and dileptons in the same way . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , employing the off - shell hsd approach , we explore the influence of in - medium effects like the modification of self - energies and spectral functions of the vector mesons due to their interactions with the hadronic environment . </S>",
    "<S> we find only a modest influence of the in - medium effects on the dilepton spectra in the invariant mass range where data with small error bars exist . </S>"
