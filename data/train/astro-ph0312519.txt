    "( 1995 ) which was based on schmidt objective prism plates searching for strong h@xmath0 emission galaxies with observed equivalent widths ew(h@xmath0+[nii])@xmath510 .",
    "the evolution of galaxies is inferred by comparing the global star formation rates at higher redshift with gallego et al.s value at @xmath6 .",
    "radio investigations have suggested star formation rates higher than gallego et al.s by a factor of two ( cram 1998 ; serjeant , gruppioni & oliver 2002 ) .",
    "the follow - up work for gallego et al.s sample by gil de paz et al .",
    "( 2000 ) gave valuable information as to the nature of star forming galaxies , yet the question of when galaxies show star formation activity among their entire population remains uncovered .",
    "also a poorly understood aspect is the star formation activity as a function of morphology of galaxies , which constitutes another dimension of galaxy formation .",
    "in fact , there are a few pieces of work which studied the star formation rate as a function of morphologies of galaxies ( kennicutt & kent 1983 ; ryder & dopita 1994 ; hereinafter rd94 ) .",
    "these studies , however , were based on nearby galaxy samples , which were preselected by choice , while ideally one want to study homogeneous galaxy samples .",
    "the primary difficulty of this approach for nearby galaxies is to obtain accurate spectroscopic information for a homogeneous galaxy sample over a large area of the sky .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) overcome this difficulty with its spectroscopic data for a large number of homogeneously selected galaxies .",
    "the sdss data also allow significantly more accurate treatments as to the control over selection effects , such as those expected in line - selected samples , and systematic errors arising from stellar absorption , extinction , and contamination from agn .",
    "in this paper we use the optically - selected and morphology - classified bright galaxy sample from the sloan digital sky survey for the northern equatorial stripe .",
    "the sample is flux - limited with @xmath7 mag after dereddening corrections , and morphological classification is given by visual inspections .",
    "this sample , with median redshift @xmath8 , has been used to derive luminosity functions ( lf ) of morphologically selected galaxies ( nakamura et al .",
    "2003 ; hereinafter n03 ) .",
    "the sdss spectroscopy covers from 3900 to 9000   with the resolution of 2 - 5  .",
    "redshifts are identified and ews are measured with the spectroscopic pipeline .",
    "we use h@xmath0 as an indicator of star formation activity .",
    "the sdss spectroscopy is sufficient to resolve h@xmath0 and [ n ii]@xmath96548,6583 doublet .",
    "the advantage of using h@xmath0 as the star formation indicator is that this emission arises from the ionising flux that is produced by massive short - lived stars compared , for instance , to the indicators using the uv light at 1500 - 2800  which survives , or even increases , for a significant duration of time after stars formed ( e.g. , tresse & maddox 1998 ; glazebrook et al . 1999 ) .",
    "another advantage is that the extinction correction is smaller and readily corrected for by using the balmer line ratio .",
    "this contrasts to uv emission , which suffers from large extinction but also an uncertainty in extinction laws ( calzetti et al .",
    "the most important disadvantage with the sdss spectroscopy for our purpose is that it uses fibres of small apertures , and the aperture correction is essential .",
    "we circumvent this problem by using the empirical radial profile of h@xmath0 obtained by rd94 to calculate the total h@xmath0 flux .    our prime purpose is to investigate the h@xmath0 emissivity distribution for each class of morphological type of galaxies , and its contribution to global h@xmath0 luminosity in the nearby universe ( @xmath10 ) using a well - defined optically flux - limited sample .",
    "we prefer to use traditional morphological classification obtained by visual inspections , since spectroscopic or colour indicators are too sensitive to small amounts of star formation activity , whereas visual morphology reflects dynamical evolution of galaxies more faithfully .",
    "the drawback of this approach is the small size of the sample ( 1600 galaxies ) .",
    "notwithstanding , we emphasise that the present study is based on a galaxy sample with homogeneous morphological classification and accurate photometry ; the resulting h@xmath0 emission sample is significantly larger than those used in previous studies .    in section 2",
    "we describe the data and various corrections that are crucial to our study .",
    "the h@xmath0 lf is derived in section 3 for each morphological class .",
    "a detailed comparison is given with the work of gallego et al .",
    "( 1995 ) for the total h@xmath0 luminosity density in this section .",
    "morphological - type and colour dependence of h@xmath0 emissivity is presented in section 4 , and implications of our results are discussed in section 5 .",
    "we adopt the cosmology @xmath11 and @xmath12 throughout this paper , although the physical parameters of our objects , being at such low redshift , depend little on @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "we use the standard notation @xmath15 km s@xmath3mpc@xmath3 to demonstrate the dependence of quantities upon @xmath16 .",
    "our sample is derived from the photometric images ( gunn et al .",
    "1998 ; hogg et al . 2001 ; pier et al . 2003 ) of run 752/756 of early sdss observations [ the area lies along the celestial equator for @xmath17 .",
    "the observations cover 229.7 deg@xmath18 in the five colour band photometric system ( fukugita et al .",
    "1996 ) , calibrated by the standard star network established by the work at usno ( smith et al .",
    "the bulk of data were published in early data release ( stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ) , and are also included in data release one ( dr1 , abazajian et al .",
    "spectroscopic information is obtained for galaxies that satisfy accurately defined selection criteria ( strauss et al .",
    "2002 ; blanton et al .",
    "the morphological classification was performed by visual inspections for all galaxies with dereddened petrosian magnitude of @xmath19 included in the rectangular area of run 752/756 .",
    "the morphological index @xmath20 is assigned to e , s0 , sa , sb , sc , sd and i m .",
    "the galaxies that show largely disturbed morphologies are given @xmath21 .",
    "the size of galaxy sample with spectroscopic information is 1600 ( see table 1 of n03 ) .    among 1600 galaxies , we drop 21 objects because of either low ( @xmath22% ) redshift confidence or misallocation of fibres to overlapping stars , 29 galaxies because of poor photometry due to deblending of neighboring objects , and 59 galaxies that fall either @xmath23 or @xmath24 . we remove an additional 9 galaxies with @xmath25 , at which magnitude the spectroscopic survey completeness is lowered due to the sdss target selection algorithms .",
    "these cuts leave 1482 galaxies for our consideration . this data set is the same as the sample from which the morphologically - dependent luminosity function was derived in n03 ( sample 5 in table 1 of n03 ) , and is recapitulated in table 1 below .",
    "these selections do not introduce any significant bias into the sample with respect to morphology or luminosity .",
    "the sdss spectroscopy was carried out using fibres of @xmath26 diameter placed on the centre of each object with f/5 optics .",
    "the 2 - 5   spectral resolution of the double spectrographs resolves h@xmath0 emission from [ nii]@xmath276548 and [ nii]@xmath276583 .",
    "this contrasts to earlier works where h@xmath0 is often blended with nitrogen lines ( e , g .",
    ", sullivan et al . 2000 ; tresse & maddox 1998 ) .",
    "redshifts and ews are automatically measured by the sdss spectroscopic pipeline and are catalogued .",
    "we use redshifts converted into the values in the galactic standard of rest according to de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "there is little confusion in the measurement of h@xmath0 equivalent widths : visual inspection of spectra shows that emission lines with greater than @xmath280.5  in the observed frame are accurately measured for the majority of galaxies .",
    "manual remeasurements of ews for selected galaxies using iraf show that the error is less than @xmath29  for small ews and less than 10% for larger ews .",
    "the error mostly arises from the fit to the continuum",
    ". we shall work with the rest - frame equivalent width ( hereafter we always refer to the rest - frame ew unless otherwise noted ) with measurements at more than 2.5@xmath30 .",
    "a total of 30 galaxies have ew@xmath31  yet the detection confidence is less than 2.5@xmath30 : those galaxies are omitted from our main sample . we find that most cases this occurs when the h@xmath0 line is too broad and/or emission of [ nii ] is much stronger than that of h@xmath0 , and automated deblending of the h@xmath0 lines is not properly executed .",
    "so , those that are missed by 2.5@xmath30 criterion for ew@xmath32  are agn like galaxies .",
    "finally , we dropped one galaxy for which the fibre is centred on a hii region off the centre of galaxy .",
    "thus , our emission line galaxy sample contains 665 galaxies .",
    "we show in figure 1 the ew distribution of h@xmath0 for morphologically - classified sample , from the latest type ( top panel ) to earlier types .",
    "the bottom panel is the total sample",
    ". a negative ew signifies absorption .",
    "the solid lines correspond to our main sample with ew@xmath32   and the detection at @xmath33 , and dotted are galaxies that do not satisfy these criteria .",
    "note that the ordinate is a logarithmic .",
    "the mean of emission line strengths for each morphological class is indicated by the diamonds . in this average",
    "( indicated by dotted histogram ) , we include galaxies with ew@xmath34  and with lower confidence detection , as well as those that do not show emission at all .",

    "[ sec : agn ] , are denoted with shading .",
    "the numbers are presented in table  1 , where emission line galaxies are listed separately for non - agn and agn galaxies .",
    "the bottom panel shows that for ew@xmath35  the galaxies that are excluded from the sample by 2.5@xmath30 detection are only a few , and the sample is virtually complete .",
    "the sample incompleteness for ew@xmath36   is about 14% .",
    "we also try to include those galaxies which do not satisfy the @xmath32   or the 2.5@xmath30 criterion in our analysis and examine how the results change .",
    "the measured balmer emission line equivalent widths must be corrected for stellar absorption .",
    "the absorption not only decreases h@xmath0 emission flux , but also significantly affects estimates of reddening corrections inferred from balmer line ratios .",
    "figure 2 shows the relation between ew(h@xmath0 ) and ew(h@xmath37)@xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the continuum flux densities at the two lines [ @xmath40 for galaxies with ew(h@xmath0)@xmath41   in our sample ] .",
    "the relation plotted in this figure is equivalent to that between the line fluxes , @xmath42h@xmath0 ) and @xmath42h@xmath37 ) .",
    "considering galaxies with ew(h@xmath0)@xmath510.0 , for which corresponding ew(h@xmath37 ) is mostly larger than 1.0 and hence the h@xmath37 measurement is reliable , we obtain with a @xmath43 fit , @xmath44 where 3@xmath30 rejection is applied .",
    "the existence of a non - zero constant term indicates the presence of stellar absorption .",
    "if we take the h@xmath0 absorption to have an equivalent width of @xmath45 , as indicated from the conspicuous clustering of non - emission line galaxies seen in the figure , we obtain from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ew ] ) ew(h@xmath46 , which is also consistent with the position of ew(h@xmath47 for non - emission line galaxies .",

    "after extinction corrections and assuming the standard balmer line ratios , as we describe in the next subsection , we obtain ew(h@xmath51 .",

    "the change of the temperature by a factor of two modifies @xmath56 only by 5% ; the change of @xmath68 affects @xmath56 very little .    for galaxies with @xmath33 detection of h@xmath37 [ ew(h@xmath0)@xmath6910.0 ] ,",

    "the distribution of extinction is shown in figure 4 after converting it into @xmath71 band extinction @xmath72 using @xmath73 .",

    "this distribution is consistent with that obtained by sullivan et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for @xmath75 galaxies ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "the mean extinction also agrees with the value derived by kennicutt ( 1983 ) .",
    "if stellar absorption is not taken into account , the extinction correction would become erroneously large by 70% , as noted by sullivan et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and the resulting extinction correction would also show an anticorrelation with the h@xmath0 equivalent width . for rather weak emitters , i.e. , ew(h@xmath0)@xmath7710.0 or the h@xmath37 detection below @xmath78 , we adopt @xmath70=0.81 ( @xmath79 which is determined by the h@xmath0/h@xmath37 line ratio calculated from eq .",

    "since we are primarily interested in the star formation activity , we must remove h@xmath0 contributions from agn .",

    "we require that four relevant lines be detected at more than 2.5@xmath30 .",
    "then , 363 galaxies out of 665 galaxies pass this criterion .",

    "89 galaxies satisfy this criterion and are identified as seyfert ii or liner .",
    "the frequency of agn thus identified is 6% , compared to 18% in the kauffmann et al .",
    "the difference arises from weak h@xmath37 line emitters , for which special effort is made by kauffmann et al . to measure weak lines with higher signal - to - noise ratio . in our sample about 3% of galaxies with h@xmath37 emission of ew@xmath51  are missed by our 2.5@xmath30 criterion , but this fraction increases to 26% for ew=0.5 - 1   and rapidly increases for ew@xmath81  .",
    "most of the difference in numbers of agn between kauffmann et al . and this study arises from galaxies with ew(h@xmath82 , which are not important to us .",
    "if we use two - line diagnostic with only h@xmath0 and [ nii ] [ @xmath83\\lambda6583/{\\rm h}\\alpha)>-0.3 $ ] ] , the number of agn increases to 235 galaxies which is 16% of the total number of galaxies . in the next section",
    "we derive the h@xmath0 luminosity functions , the result of which only weakly depends on whether we reject 89 agn or 235 ` agn ' .",
    "since the line flux is measured with fibres of a @xmath26 aperture , aperture corrections are essential to estimate total h@xmath0 luminosity of galaxies .",
    "there is also a problem with spectrophotometric calibration , the error of which is about @xmath84% ( stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ) , which we confirmed for our sample .",
    "the aperture correction is made by using empirical radial profiles of h@xmath0 and broad band fluxes obtained by rd94 .",
    "these authors studied h@xmath0 and @xmath85 band surface brightnesses for 34 nearby s0 and spiral galaxies .",
    "we show in figure 5 the h@xmath0 flux versus @xmath86 band flux ( @xmath85 mag of rd94 is translated to @xmath86 system using fukugita et al .",

    ", we extrapolate the measured flux assuming an exponential profile with the scale length determined by rd94 ( this gives @xmath88% correction ) . for the h@xmath0 flux ,",
    "there is a natural cutoff at @xmath89 erg s@xmath3kpc@xmath90 , as shown by kennicutt ( 1998 ) , and the limit of rd94 measurement agrees with this cutoff ; the integration of the flux measured by rd94 gives the total h@xmath0 flux .",
    "the growth curve thus constructed is shown in figure 6 , together with those of individual galaxies ( the error bars show one sigma at representative points ) .",
    "the composite growth curve shows that h@xmath0 emission activity is somewhat more active in the outer region of galaxies than in the central part , although for individual galaxies the growth curves show a variety .",
    "note that our @xmath26 aperture corresponds to @xmath91 kpc at @xmath92 .",
    "we first renormalise the spectrophotometric flux by adjusting @xmath86 band synthetic magnitude obtained from spectrophotometry to the corresponding @xmath26 aperture photometric magnitude to remove the calibration error of spectrophotometry , and then apply the growth curve to find the total h@xmath0 flux from its spectrophotometric flux and @xmath86 band photometric fluxes at the @xmath26 and the petrosian apertures .",
    "our calculation takes into account the aspect ratio of the galaxy images , which gives only a small correction .",
    "the aperture correction amounts to 2.40@xmath93 mag for @xmath94 , @xmath95 mag at @xmath96 and @xmath97 mag at @xmath98 ( the error stands for rms ) .",
    "the total h@xmath0 flux we estimate is shown in figure 7 .",
    "we do not see any systematic variations of the high luminosity edge as a function of redshift , suggesting that aperture corrections are properly done .",
    "systematic errors from this aperture correction are estimated by changing the composite growth curve by @xmath99 .",
    "if we would apply aperture correction simply by scaling the synthetic h@xmath0 flux with the broad band fluxes measured at two apertures , we underestimate the total h@xmath0 flux by 20@xmath10025% .",
    "we calculate the h@xmath0 luminosity function ( lf ) for five morphological classes and for the total sample . we treat e and e / s0-s0 separately , but when we compute lf we add the two together since the number of h@xmath0 emission e galaxies ( fukugita et al .",
    "2003 ) is too small to derive a reliable lf for this type .",

    "the function in the sum corresponds to the inverse of a survey volume in a given magnitude bin given by the maximum likelihood estimator .",

    "we attempt to estimate errors by the jackknife method dividing the sky region into 20 segments .",
    "we find that those errors are comparable to one standard deviation errors we quoted .",
    "we calculate h@xmath0 luminosity density for each morphological class by integrating the schechter function to zero luminosity .",

    "the two estimates show good agreement for late types , but the two differ by 0.1 dex for e - s0 and i m , for which statistics are very small and the schechter function fits are rather poor : for these cases the direct sum is probably more reliable , and the luminosity densities from the direct sum are adopted for our discussion .",
    "the total luminosity density from the schechter function is @xmath113 , which agrees with @xmath114 from the direct sum .",

    "[ sec : agn ] , the luminosity density decreases by 5% .",
    "the shape of the h@xmath0 lf changes very little .",
    "a complete inclusion of all agn would increase the h@xmath0 luminosity density , but it is no more than by + 18% .",
    "the systematic uncertainties we considered are summarised in table 3 , expressed in the form of the change in the luminosity density .",
    "we also include the cases which , we believe , are unrealistic in order to show the effect if we ignore the relevant considerations , as are occasionally seen in some previous works .",
    "the systematic error is obtained by adding the entries with asterisk in quadrature : our estimate is + 0.10 dex and @xmath1000.07 dex for @xmath126 .",
    "the characteristics of our h@xmath0 lf are as follows .",
    "the h@xmath0 lf for the total sample is fitted well by a schechter function with @xmath1 and @xmath127 . the h@xmath0 luminosity density derived from our lf , @xmath128 we estimate the systematic error to be @xmath129 .",
    "2 . early- ( @xmath130 ) and late - type @xmath131 spirals are the dominant contributors to the total h@xmath0 lf .",
    "the h@xmath0 lfs for these two types of galaxies are similar , and they determine the shape of the total lf .",
    "the faint end slopes are somewhat steeper than those for the @xmath107 band lf .",
    "spiral galaxies ( @xmath132 ) produce 83% of the total h@xmath0 luminosity density .",
    "the contribution of early type galaxies ( e and s0 ) is only 9% of the total luminosity density . in particular",
    "the luminosity density from e ( 8 galaxies ) is only 6% that of all early type ( e to s0 ) galaxies .",
    "the characteristic luminosity of the h@xmath0 lf for the e - s0 types is about 0.7 dex fainter than those for spiral galaxies .",
    "while our ` best fit ' to the h@xmath0 lf indicates a decline towards the faint end , we are not able to conclude whether the h@xmath0 lf for early type galaxies actually declines because of the small number of galaxies and the omission of very weak h@xmath0 emitters .",
    "the inclusion of weak emitters [ ew(h@xmath0)@xmath119( ) ] lifts the faint end slope , although @xmath0 is still larger than @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) .",
    "the h@xmath0 lf for i m type galaxies shows a steep faint end slope .",
    "this result is similar to that found for the @xmath107 band lf .",
    "i m galaxies contribute 5% of the local h@xmath0 luminosity density .",
    "this is rather a significant fraction if we consider the fact that only 0.7% of galaxies ( 10 galaxies ) in our sample are i m type and their broad band luminosity is fainter than that of normal galaxies .",
    "we also note in figure 1 that all i m galaxies are strong h@xmath0 emitters .",
    "most of the galaxies with unclassified morphology ( 6 out of 7 galaxies ) are also strong h@xmath0 emitters [ ew(h@xmath135 ] .",
    "these unclassified galaxies contain mergers .      since the work of gallego et al .",
    "( 1995 ) provides the current fiducial value for the star formation rate at zero redshift , we shall present a detailed comparison of their results and our h@xmath0 lf .    the luminosity function and luminosity density we derived are consistent with the findings of gallego et al . who derived @xmath136 , and @xmath137 .",
    "while this @xmath138 looks somewhat smaller than our value , @xmath138 and @xmath0 are correlated such that @xmath139 ; so if we adjust @xmath140 , then we have @xmath141 which is smaller than our @xmath142 only by 1 @xmath30 .",
    "the luminosity density @xmath143 is larger than ( [ eq : l - density ] ) by about 20% ( 0.07 dex ) .",
    "we consider , however , that these rather good agreements are fortuitous .",
    "gallego et al . did not take account of stellar absorption .",
    "the neglect of stellar absorptions leads to a substantial overestimate of extinction corrections ( see section [ sec : extinc ] above ) .",
    "we find that their selective extinction @xmath144 tabulated in the catalogue of gallego et al .",
    "( 1996 ) show a conspicuous decrease as the h@xmath0 equivalent width increases , which is the feature that occurs if stellar absorption is ignored .",
    "in fact their mean value of @xmath145 ( @xmath146 ) is 1.9 times as large as the extinction we obtained .",
    "this overestimate of the absorption makes the luminosity density larger by 0.16 dex than the true value ( see table 3 ) .",
    "the inclusion of agn also leads to an overestimate of the luminosity density by @xmath147 dex .",
    "gallego et al .",
    "set the threshold ew(h@xmath0+[nii])@xmath510(effective h@xmath0 ew 7 ) ; this selection would cause a 10% decrease in the h@xmath0 luminosity density .",
    "what gives a strong effect is their sample incompleteness , which compensates the significant overdensity seen above .",
    "the surface density of h@xmath0 emitters with ew(h@xmath0+[nii])@xmath510   is 176/471=0.37 per sq .",
    "this is compared with 306/230=1.33 per sq .",
    "deg . when we select emission line galaxies from the sdss sample in a manner that satisfies the same ew threshold and @xmath148 as in gallego et al .",
    "the ew distributions of the two samples are compared in figure 10 , which shows where gallego et al.s sample is incomplete .",
    "note that we have applied aperture corrections for the ew distribution of the sdss sample so that the line flux represents that from the entire galaxy .",
    "it appears that the underestimate due to sample incompleteness cancels the overestimates from the neglects of stellar absorptions and contamination from agn .",
    "figure 1 and table 1 above show the clear trend that the fraction of h@xmath0 emission galaxies increases as @xmath149 moves from early to late types .",
    "if we set the threshold of ew@xmath32 , the fraction of galaxies with h@xmath0 emission is 5% ( 4% if we remove galaxies with agn activity ) for e galaxies , 15% ( 12% ) for s0 galaxies , 54% ( 44% ) for s0/a - sb and 86% ( 80% ) for sbc - sd galaxies .",
    "we have seen that s0/a - sb and sbc - sd contribute nearly the same amount to the luminosity density .",
    "this is due to a larger number of s0/a - sb type galaxies than that of sbc - sd ( by a factor of 1.5 ) , whereas the fraction of emitters in the former class is less by 1.6 times than the latter ; these changes in the two factors cancel and leave the luminosity density unchanged . in our sample ,",
    "the fraction of h@xmath0 emitters is 100% for i m galaxies . a high fraction ( @xmath150% )",
    "is also recorded for galaxies of unclassified types .",
    "conversely , 89% of emitters are spiral galaxies , and they contribute to 83% of the h@xmath0 luminosity density .",
    "note that elliptical galaxies are not necessarily inactive ( fukugita et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "galaxies in each morphological class contain strong h@xmath0 emitters .",
    "if one makes a cut at high ew threshold , say at 10 , the average of ew for those emitters look nearly independent of morphology .",
    "the most important difference that varies with morphology is in the increasing number of non - emission or weak emission galaxies towards early types .",
    "therefore the average ew decreases to early types when the average is taken over all galaxies including non - emission galaxies .",
    "the ` average ' emission equivalent width depends on how to set the threshold for emission galaxies .",
    "kennicutt and kent ( 1983 ) showed a clear correlation of ew(h@xmath0+[nii ] ) with morphology , notably the absence of strong emitters in earlier types ( sa or earlier ) .",
    "we consider this absence of emitters being due to their small sample , and in particular to the fact that bona fide early - type galaxies are selected before the observation .",
    "the natural assumption is that h@xmath0 emission galaxies , being hosts to vigorous star formation , should have bluer colours than galaxies that are bereft of h@xmath0 emission .",
    "tresse & maddox ( 1998 ) claimed , however , that there is no correlation between h@xmath0 luminosity @xmath151 and @xmath152 colour .",
    "we also find in our sample that the correlation between h@xmath0 luminosity and @xmath153 colour is weak ( figure 11a ) .",
    "also , we do not see correlations with other colour indices , e.g. , @xmath154 .",
    "the correlation we should actually expect , however , is not between total h@xmath0 luminosity and colour , but between h@xmath0 emissivity per unit mass ( or per broad band luminosity ) and the colour . to see this point we plot in figure 11b the correlation of the h@xmath0 luminosity divided by @xmath86 band luminosity with @xmath155 colour .",
    "the expected correlation is observed : there is a 2 mag change in h@xmath0 luminosity normalised by @xmath86 band luminosity across 0.5 mag change in @xmath156 colour , though the scatter is significant , especially for strong h@xmath0 emitters .",
    "we have derived the h@xmath0 luminosity function for the nearby universe and have made a break down into morphological types of galaxies .",
    "our sample contain 665 emission line galaxies , which are compared , for example , to 176 galaxies in gallego et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , 159 galaxies in sullivan et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and 110 galaxies in tresse & maddox ( 1998 ) ; see table 4 , which gives a comparison of the present result with those of the earlier work made for low redshifts .",
    "our observed range of l(h@xmath0 ) is 0.4 dex deeper than gallego et al . ,",
    "although it is shallower by 0.4 - 0.8 dex than surveys of distant galaxies by sullivan et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and tresse & maddox ( 1998 ) .",
    "the local h@xmath0 luminosity density we have obtained is @xmath2 erg s@xmath3mpc@xmath4 .",
    "the central value is lower than that of gallego et al .",
    "( 1995 ) but only by 0.08 dex , although this agreement is fortuitous .",
    "the significant discrepancy between tresse & maddox ( 1998 ) and sullivan et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for analyses at non - zero redshift hinders us from drawing a definitive conclusions as to the evolution of h@xmath0 emissivity . in comparing the characteristic luminosities we note that @xmath138 and @xmath0 are strongly correlated . assuming an empirical law , @xmath157 , tresse & maddox s value is ( @xmath158 ) dex and sullivan et al.s is ( @xmath159 dex if we adjust @xmath0 to our @xmath160 .",
    "our value is in between the two .",
    "our faint end slope is also between the two groups of authors . on the other hand , the h@xmath0 luminosity density of the two groups ( @xmath161 , @xmath162)@xmath163 erg s@xmath3mpc@xmath4 are larger than our value by 2.2@xmath1001.3 times .",
    "we emphasize , however , that the samples at non - zero redshifts are too small , and the uncertainty in the correction of the spectroscopically obtained flux to total flux might also be significant ; the definitive conclusion may not be drawn as to the evolution at low redshift .",
    "the evolution can be concluded , however , if we compare our results with those at high redshifts ( e.g. , glazebrook et al .",
    "1999 ; tresse et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the conversion of h@xmath0 luminosity density to the global star formation rate per unit volume depends further on models of star formation and absorption of the ionising flux in the star - forming regions ( charlot & longhetti 2001 ) .",
    "if we adopt the conversion factor of glazebrook et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for the case bc96(kl96 ) @xmath164 , and salpeter imf ( with the lower mass cutoff at 0.1@xmath165 ) : @xmath166erg s@xmath3 for star formation rate of 1 @xmath165 yr@xmath3 , we obtain the global star formation rate @xmath167 : @xmath168 ignoring internal absorption of the ionising flux .",
    "some early type galaxies , even elliptical galaxies , emit strong h@xmath0 by star formation activity , almost as strong as that of late spiral galaxies .",
    "this contradicts the conventional wisdom that all ellipticals formed in the early universe .",
    "the fraction of h@xmath0 emitters , however , is quite small : it is only 1% if we take a threshold of ew(h@xmath11810  ( and 5% with ew(h@xmath169 ) : the majority of elliptical galaxies no longer have significant star formation . on the other hand ,",
    "there are many late spiral galaxies that do not show h@xmath0 emission ( in our sample all i m galaxies are h@xmath0 emitters ) .",
    "the presence of non star - forming spiral galaxies is consistent with the view that star formation in disc galaxies is intermittent , but the fraction of star forming galaxies with @xmath170yr@xmath3 ( @xmath171% ) indicates that in spiral galaxies such star formation activity takes place about half the time .",
    "the quantity that shows a strong correlation with morphology of galaxies is the fraction of h@xmath0 emitters , or the mean h@xmath0 luminosities , not the h@xmath0 luminosities of individual galaxies .",
