    "the notion of a decoherence - free ( or noiseless ) subspace ( dfs ) has been proposed as one strategy to combat the effects of decoherence in quantum computation  @xcite and has the advantage of being passive , in contrast to quantum error correction , which requires active syndrome measurement and feed forward  @xcite .",
    "the construction of a dfs relies on the existence of symmetries in the decoherence process that allow certain subspaces of quantum states to be completely decoupled from the environment .",
    "a dfs is of practical interest because it would reduce errors due to decoherence , thereby lowering the quantum error correction overhead in quantum information processing , and be especially useful in providing longer quantum memory .",
    "extensive formal analyses of the dfs have been performed   @xcite and dfs have been applied in quantum information processing to reduce errors due to decoherence @xcite . however , realizing a dfs ( or approximate dfss that would reduce decoherence over a finite , but long time scale ) under general conditions is required .",
    "our goal here is to address this need , namely to introduce general realistic principles for decoherence of systems of particles , to create a formalism for describing these systems in order to determine systematically when a perfect dfs is impossible , and to demonstrate by example how an approximate dfs can be created even though a perfect dfs can not be .",
    "we assume that the dfs is encoded into a collection of  @xmath0 identical particles , each with a @xmath1-dimensional internal hilbert space @xmath2 spanned by the states @xmath3 although the particles are identical , they are not co - located ( except when we refer to the `` dicke limit ''  @xcite in which the separation of particles is allowed to tend to zero ) .",
    "the position of particle @xmath4 is denoted @xmath5 . in the absence of any coupling to the environment ,",
    "each internal level @xmath6 is a stationary state of the system s hamiltonian evolution with eigenvalue  @xmath7 ( we set @xmath8 ) .",
    "this system interacts with a reservoir , which is assumed to have no memory ( markovian ) . at time",
    "@xmath9 , the state of the system  @xmath10 and the state of the reservoir  @xmath11 are independent and then commence interacting .",
    "this separability of system and reservoir states is standard in the theory of open quantum systems , and we assume that the evolution of the system in the presence of the reservoir can be described by a completely positive map on the system , or equivalently by a lindblad master equation  @xcite .",
    "we add the additional assumption that the reservoir is translationally invariant , which is reasonable but is also an important and restrictive assumption in studying spatially extended systems of particles .",
    "the generator of translation is a vector momentum operator @xmath12 .",
    "we assume that the hamiltonian reservoir dynamics depend on @xmath13 and not on the direction of @xmath12 , i.e. the reservoir has no preferred direction .",
    "we refer to a reservoir satisfying these conditions as a homogeneous isotropic markovian reservoir .",
    "finally we place some reasonable restrictions on the interaction between system and reservoir .",
    "specifically , we consider an interaction hamiltonian of the form @xmath14 with reservoir operators @xmath15 , which depend on the position of the interacting particle @xmath4 , and system operators @xmath16 that raise and lower the system energy levels . here",
    "@xmath17 in the sum , which ensures that terms involving states @xmath18 and @xmath19 of the same energy are excluded .",
    "thus the reservoir absorbs and delivers energy to the system but does not contribute to strict dephasing .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hint ] ) will be used to derive a master equation for the system .    in summary",
    ", we have a system of particles with internal levels interacting linearly with a reservoir that is translationally invariant , whose hamiltonian is independent of direction .",
    "these assumptions describe typical realistic systems , for example atomic or molecular gases , but have serious implications for constructing a dfs . on the one hand",
    ", we will find that we rule out the existence of a dfs under quite general conditions , but on the other hand , we will establish a foundation for obtaining a decoherence - suppressed subspace that is an approximate dfs .",
    "the density operator for the system , traced over the reservoir , is given by @xmath20 , which is a bounded operator on the hilbert space  @xmath21 for the system of  @xmath0 particles , each with  @xmath1 internal levels . under the assumptions given in sec .",

    "we also define reduced decoherence matrix to be @xmath222 .",
    "eigenvalues of the decoherence operator , @xmath47 , provide inverse lifetimes of the states in the system .",

    ". this matrix describes the states in the system of @xmath0 two - level atoms with one atom in the excited state .",
    "it also describes the states for @xmath0 two - level atoms with all atoms except one in the excited state ( see appendix [ app : reducedmatrix ] ) . in general , it is much easier to deal with an @xmath224 matrix @xmath223 rather than with an @xmath225 matrix representation of the decoherence operator @xmath47 .    for special cases where",
    "the location of atoms can be described with one variable , one can produce two dimensional plots that show the dependence of lifetimes on the separation between atoms . as an example , consider @xmath0 atoms in a line .",
    "the separation between adjacent atoms is taken to be equal ( @xmath226 ) .",
    "1(a , c , d ) show particular configurations of two - level atoms in a line as well as the orientation of the dipole moment for the atoms that we consider here . figs .",
    "2(a , c , d ) depict the inverse lifetimes ( eigenvalues of matrix @xmath223 ) of the states in the system of two and four atoms , when only one atom is excited , as a function of @xmath86 . in fig .",
    "1(b ) we consider the system of four atoms that form a square .",
    "the inverse lifetimes for states that arise when only one atom is excited in this system are shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) . from the plots",
    "one can see that there are long - lived states ( i.e. , inverse lifetimes close to zero ) when adjacent atoms are separated by less than a quarter of the emission wavelength ( @xmath227 ) . for each cluster of closely located atoms",
    ", one could use the states with longest lifetimes ( smallest eigenvalues ) to encode a qubit .",
    "so how much advantage can one gain if the separation between atoms is small ? in fig .",
    "2(c ) the longest lifetime possible is @xmath228 times longer than the lifetime of the state of an isolated atom when the separation between adjacent atoms is just @xmath227 .",
    "however , the second longest lifetime possible in this system is just @xmath229 times longer than the lifetime of the state of an isolated atom",
    ". thus if we have chosen to construct a qubit from these two states , our effective advantage would be just the lifetime of the second state .",
    "the situation is a little better if we consider configurations that have more symmetry : for example , consider the square in fig .",
    "here the lifetimes for the two collective states are comparable when the separation between atoms is small . when the side of the square is equal to @xmath227 , the two largest lifetimes are @xmath230 and @xmath231 times longer than the lifetime of the state of an isolated atom .",
    "we have shown how lifetimes for quantum states increase when the separation between atoms is small for a collection of a few atoms .",
    "similar effect can be observed in a large collection of atoms .",
    "spontaneous decay rate from a collection of a large number of two - level atoms was recently studied in two configurations : ( a ) @xmath0 atoms in a linear chain with the same distance between neighboring atoms  @xcite and ( b ) a circular configuration , in which atoms were placed equidistantly on the circumference of the circle  @xcite .    for the case of the linear chain",
    ", a numerical study showed that for large number of atoms ( 40 - 100 )  @xcite , significant decay rate suppression was observed when neighboring atoms were separated by a distance @xmath232 .",
    "in the limit of @xmath233 , the decay rate was seen to have a jump - like behavior at @xmath234 .",
    "this observation implied that the spontaneous decay rate is unstable and susceptible to environmental perturbations in the vicinity of this critical value .",
    "analysis of the circular configuration of atoms offered more surprising results .",
    "it was observed that for a given radius @xmath86 of the circular configuration , once a certain critical number of atoms is reached the lifetime of the maximally subradiant state increases exponentially and is now stable to perturbations . for example , for @xmath235 ,",
    "the critical number of atoms is fourteen , and , at this moment , the smallest interatomic distance between atoms is @xmath236 .",
    "proposition [ prop : nomdfs ] states under which conditions a dfs does not exist , namely whenever the set of atoms is away from the dicke limit . to find a dfs outside of the dicke limit we therefore have to find systems that violate these conditions .",
    "one way would be to consider a single - particle dfs with many such particles in the system .",
    "another way is to engineer a reservoir that is not of homogeneous isotropic markovian type .",
    "although the single - particle dfs is excluded for two - level atoms , a dfs can be created by a collection of particles that have a nontrivial internal structure .",
    "unfortunately the spherical symmetry of atoms induces selection rules for angular momentum eigenstates that prohibit the existence of a dfs in isolated atoms .",
    "however , instead of atoms one can use molecules that do not posses a spherical symmetry .",
    "a dfs in molecules is known in the literature as spontaneous emission cancellation .",
    "it has been reported for rydberg states in na@xmath237  @xcite but the observation has been questioned  @xcite .",
    "the conclusions we have reached about the existence of dfs in this work depend in a fundamental way on the fact that the quantum system was embedded in three - dimensional space",
    ". requirements for existence of dfs in one - dimensional structures are different .",
    "the logic behind proposition  [ prop : nomdfs ] tells us that in this case the separation between atoms is no longer required to be zero for the existence of a dfs .",
    "( in one - dimensional structures , the reservoir transformation functions are reduced to scalars and condition for linear dependence is always satisfied . ) therefore , a multi - particle dfs may exist for atoms placed in an effectively one - dimensional structure such as a waveguide or an optical fiber .",
    "p. zanardi and f. rossi have discussed similar results in the context of semiconductor structures @xcite .    in summary , we have developed a new way to determine the existence of both single - particle and multi - particle dfs , for realistic systems described by a markovian master equation . we have demonstrated that a perfect multi - particle dfs requires co - located particles ( i.e. ,  the dicke limit ) for systems placed in a homogeneous isotropic markovian reservoir , which is not possible .",
    "our analysis shows however that it is nevertheless possible to have a single - particle dfs involving many atoms .",
    "also a multi - particle dfs for atoms situated in one - dimensional structures might be possible .",
