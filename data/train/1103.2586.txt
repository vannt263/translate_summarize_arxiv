    "the non - zero value of the non - linearity parameter @xmath3 may generate a non - zero value of the skewness ( 3rd order moment ) , the kurtosis(4-th order moment ) and so on .",
    "obviously , the skewness can be parametrized by the leading term using @xmath3 .",
    "however , the kurtosis can be affected not only by the @xmath3 term but also by higher order terms , such as the @xmath7 term in the above expression ( [ eq : originalfnl ] ) . in general",
