    "beta - encoders with error correction were recently introduced in @xmath8 as quantization algorithms in analog - to - digital ( a / d ) conversion that are simultaneously robust with respect to quantizer imperfections ( like sigma - delta schemes ) and efficient in their bit - budget use ( like pulse code modulation schemes ) . for a detailed discussion comparing sigma delta and pulse code modulation ( pcm ) quantization schemes ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xmath9 and @xmath8 . recall that after the sampling step in analog - to - digital conversion of a bandlimited function @xmath10 with @xmath11 norm @xmath12 , an n - bit pcm quantizer simply replaces each sampled function value @xmath13 with the first n bits of its truncated binary expansion .",
    "beta - encoders are similar to pcm ; they replace each sampled function value @xmath2 with a truncated series expansion in a base @xmath3 , where @xmath4 , and with binary coefficients . clearly , if @xmath14 , then this algorithm coincides with pcm .",
    "however , whereas the binary expansion of almost every real number is unique , for every @xmath15 , there exist a continuum of different @xmath3 expansions of almost every @xmath2 in @xmath16 $ ] ( see @xmath17 ) .",
    "it is precisely this redundancy that gives beta - encoders the freedom to correct errors caused by imprecise quantizers shared by sigma delta schemes . whereas in sigma delta ,",
    "a higher degree of robustness is achieved via finer sampling , beta - encoders are made more robust by choosing a smaller value of @xmath3 as the base for expansion .",
    "+   + although beta - encoders as discussed in @xmath8 are robust with respect to quantizer imperfections , these encoders are not as robust with respect to imprecisions in other components of their circuit implementation .",
    "typically , beta - encoders require a multiplier in which real numbers are multiplied by @xmath3 .",
    "like all analog circuit components , this multiplier will be imprecise ; that is , although a known value @xmath18 may be set in the circuit implementation of the encoder , thermal fluctuations and other physical limitations will have the effect of changing the true multiplier to an unknown value @xmath19 $ ] within an interval of the pre - set value @xmath18 .",
    "the true value @xmath3 will vary from device to device , and will also change slowly in time within a single device .",
    "this variability , left unaccounted for , disqualifies the beta - encoder as a viable quantization method since the value of @xmath3 must be known with exponential precision in order to reconstruct a good approximation to the original signal from the recovered bit streams .",
    "+   + we overcome this potential limitation of the beta - encoder by introducing a method for recovering @xmath3 from the encoded bitstreams of a real number @xmath0 $ ] and its negative , @xmath20 .",
    "our method incorporates the techniques used in @xmath21 , but our analysis is simplified using a transversality condition , as defined in @xmath22 , for power series with coefficients in @xmath23 .",
    "as the value of @xmath3 can fluctuate within an interval @xmath24 $ ] over time , our recovery technique can be repeated at regular intervals during quantization ( e.g. , after the quantization of every 10 samples ) .",
    "+   + the golden ratio encoder ( gre ) was proposed in @xmath25 as a quantizer that shares the same robustness and exponential rate - distortion properties as beta - encoders , but that does not require an explicit multiplier in its circuit implementation .",
    "gre functions like a beta - encoder in that it produces beta - expansions of real numbers ; however , in gre , @xmath3 is fixed at the value of the golden ratio , @xmath26 .",
    "the relation @xmath27 characterizing the golden ratio permits elimination of the multiplier from the encoding algorithm . even though gre does not require a precise multiplier , component imperfections such as integrator leakage in the implementation of gre may still cause the true value of @xmath3 to be slightly larger than @xmath28 ; in practice it is reasonable to assume @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "our method for recovering @xmath3 in general beta - encoders can be easily extended to recovering @xmath3 in the golden ratio encoder .",
    "+   + the paper is organized as follows : +    1 .   in sections i ( a ) and i ( b )",
    ", we review relevant background on beta - encoders and golden ratio encoders , respectively .",
    "2 .   in section",
    "ii , we introduce a more realistic model of gre that takes into account the effects of integrator leak in the delay elements of the circuit .",
    "we show that the output of this revised model still correspond to truncated beta - expansions of the input , but in an unknown base @xmath3 that differs from the pre - set value .",
    "section iii describes a way to recover the unknown value of @xmath3 up to arbitrary precision using the bit streams of a `` test '' number @xmath0 $ ] , and @xmath20 .",
    "the recovery scheme reduces to finding the root of a polynomial with coefficients in @xmath30 .",
    "section iv extends the recovery procedure of the previous section to the setting of beta - encoders having leakage in the ( single ) delay element of their implementation .",
    "the analysis here is completely analogous to that of section iii .      in this section ,",
    "we summarize certain properties of beta - encoders with error correction , from the perspective of encoders which produce beta expansions with coefficients in @xmath31 . for more details on beta - encoders ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xmath8 .",
    "+   + we start from the observation that given @xmath32 $ ] , every real number @xmath33 $ ] admits a sequence @xmath34 , with @xmath35 , such that @xmath36 under the transformation @xmath37 , @xmath38 is equivalent to the observation that every real number @xmath39 $ ] admits a beta - expansion in base @xmath32 $ ] , with coefficients @xmath40 .",
    "accordingly , all of the results that follow have straightforward analogs in terms of @xmath41-beta - expansions ; see @xmath8 for more details . +   + one way to compute a sequence @xmath34 that satisfies @xmath38 is to run the iteration @xmath42 where the quantizer @xmath43 is simply the _",

    "because of this redundancy in representation , beta encoders are robust with respect to quantization error , while pcm schemes are not .",
    "we now explain in more detail what we mean by quantization error .",
    "the quantizer @xmath43 in @xmath46 is an idealized quantizer ; in practice , one has to deal with quantizers that only approximate this ideal behavior . a more realistic model is obtained by replacing @xmath43 in @xmath46 with a `` flaky '' version @xmath47 , for which we know only that @xmath48 in practice , @xmath49 is a quantity that is not known exactly , but over the magnitude of which we have some control , e.g. @xmath50 for a known @xmath51 .",
    "this value @xmath51 is called the _ tolerance _ of the quantizer .",
    "we shall call a quantization scheme _",
    "robust _ with respect to quantization error if , for some @xmath52 , the worst approximation error produced by the quantization scheme can be made arbitrarily small by allowing a sufficiently large bit budget , even if the quantizer used in its implementation is imprecise to within a tolerance @xmath51 .",
    "according to this definition , the naive @xmath31-binary expansion is not robust . more specifically ,",
    "suppose that a flaky quantizer @xmath53 is used in @xmath54 to compute the base-2 expansion of a number @xmath0 $ ] which is sufficiently small that @xmath55 .",
    "since @xmath56 is within the `` flaky '' zone for @xmath47 , if @xmath57 is assigned incorrectly ; i.e. , if @xmath58 differs from the sign of @xmath2 , then no matter how the remaining bits are assigned , the difference between @xmath2 and the number represented by the computed bits will be at least @xmath59 .",
    "this is not the case if @xmath4 , as shown by the following theorem whose proof can be found in @xmath8 :    let @xmath60 and @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "suppose that in the beta - encoding of @xmath2 , the procedure @xmath54 is followed , but the quantizer @xmath47 is used instead of the ideal @xmath43 at each occurence , with @xmath49 satisfying @xmath61 .",
    "denote by @xmath62 the bit sequence produced by applying this encoding to the number @xmath2 . if @xmath3 satisfies    @xmath63    then @xmath64 with @xmath65 .",

    "a method is proposed whereby an exponentially precise approximation @xmath68 to the value of @xmath69 at any given time can be encoded and transmitted to the decoder without actually physically measuring its value , via the encoded bitstreams of a real number @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "this decoding method can be repeated at regular time intervals during the quantization procedure , to account for the possible time - variance of @xmath72 . that an exponentially precise approximation @xmath68 to @xmath72 is sufficient to reconstruct subsequent samples @xmath73 with exponential precision is the content of the following theorem , which is essentially a restatement of theorem 5 in @xmath21 .",

    "although the approach proposed in @xmath21 for estimating @xmath3 from bitstreams overcomes potential approximation error caused by imprecise multipliers in the circuit implementation of the beta - encoder , new robustness issues are nevertheless introduced . typically",
    ", one can not ensure that the reference level 1 in @xmath71 is known with high precision . to circumvent this problem",
    ", the authors consider other heuristics whereby @xmath3 is recovered from clever averaging of multiple pairs @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "these heuristics do not require that the reference level 1 in @xmath71 be precise ; however , these approaches become quite complicated in and of themselves , and any sort of analytical analysis of their performance becomes quite difficult . in section iii , we will present a similar approach for recovering @xmath3 that does not require a precise reference level , yet still allows for exponentially precise approximations to @xmath3 .      as shown in the previous section ,",
    "beta - encoders are robust with respect to imperfect quantizer elements , and their approximation error decays exponentially with the number of bits @xmath1 . to attain this exponential precision , @xmath3 must be measured with high precision , which is quite complicated in practice .",
    "these complications motivated the invention of the golden ratio encoder ( gre ) of @xmath25 , which has the same robustness and rate - distortion properties as beta - encoders , but uses an additional delay element in place of precise multiplier in its implementation .",
    "more precisely , if one implements the recursion @xmath54 with @xmath86 , then using the relation @xmath27 , one obtains the recursion formula @xmath87 .",
    "if the term @xmath88 in this formula is removed , then the resulting recursion @xmath89 should look familiar ; indeed , with initial conditions @xmath90 , this recursion generates the fibonacci numbers @xmath91 , and it is well - known that the sequence @xmath92 as @xmath93 . if @xmath88 is instead replaced by a single bit taking values in @xmath31 , then we are led to the following scheme : @xmath94 in this paper , we will consider quantizers @xmath95 in @xmath96 of the form @xmath97 , where @xmath98 along with their flaky analogs , @xmath99 in @xmath25 , the authors consider the recursion formula @xmath96 implemented with flaky @xmath41-quantizers of the form @xmath100/2 $ ] .",

    "although the implementation of gre requires 2 more adders and one more delay element than the implementation of the beta - encoder , the multiplier element @xmath114 in gre does not have to be precise ( see section 6 ) , whereas imprecisions in the multiplier element @xmath3 of the beta - encoder result in beta - expansions of the input @xmath2 in a different base @xmath115 .",
    "in modeling the golden ratio encoder by the system @xmath96 , we are assuming that the delay elements used in its circuit implementation are ideal .",
    "a more realistic model would take into account the effect of integrator leak , which is inevitable in any practical circuit implementation ( see @xmath116 for more details ) .",
    "after one clock time , the stored input in the first delay is reduced to @xmath117 times its original value , while the stored input in the second delay is replaced by @xmath118 times its original value . in virtually all circuits of interest , no more than @xmath119 percent of the stored input is leaked at each timestep ; that is , we can safely assume that @xmath117 and @xmath118 are parameters in the interval [ .9,1 ] .",
