    "supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( sm ) has been found to be very attractive , in particular , as a solution to the hierarchy problem .",
    "superpartners of the sm fields are expected to be detected in future experiments . even at present , supersymmetry ( susy )",
    "breaking parameters are constrained from flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes as well as cp violation  @xcite .",
    "that is the so - called susy flavor problem and requires sfermion masses between the first and second generations being degenerate , unless they are sufficiently heavy or fermion and sfermion mass matrices are aligned quite well .",
    "such requirements for sfermion masses have been tried to be realized by considering flavor - blind susy breaking and/or mediation mechanisms .",
    "actually , various types of flavor - blind mechanisms have been proposed in the literature  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "understanding the origin of fermion masses and mixing angles is also one of the important issues in particle physics .",
    "three copies of sm generations have the exactly same quantum numbers except for their masses , i.e.  yukawa couplings to the higgs field . in the sm ,",
    "the exact flavor universality is violated only in the yukawa sector .",
    "one expects that the hierarchical structure of yukawa matrices is explained by some dynamics beyond the sm , and such additional dynamics necessarily leave some imprint of flavor violation . in supersymmetric models ,",
    "a mechanism for realistic fermion masses breaks the flavor universality and generally makes the corresponding sfermion masses flavor - dependent .",
    "one of the salient mechanisms for generating hierarchical yukawa couplings is the froggatt - nielsen ( fn ) mechanism with additional @xmath5 gauge symmetries  @xcite . in the fn scenarios ,",
    "flavor - dependent @xmath5 charges are assigned to matter fields so that realistic yukawa matrices are effectively realized in terms of higher - dimensional operators .",
    "there is a certain reason to believe that the @xmath5 symmetries should be gauged ; any global symmetry is expected to be unstable against quantum gravity and hence accidental . therefore the @xmath5 flavor symmetries that exactly control such operators should be gauged .",
    "consequently , after flavor symmetry breaking , the auxiliary @xmath0 fields of the @xmath5 vector multiplets give additional contribution to sfermion masses , which is proportional to @xmath5 charges and hence flavor - dependent  @xcite .",
    "that indeed gives significant modification of sparticle spectrum and in some cases is confronted with the susy flavor problem .",
    "this is called the @xmath0 problem in the present paper .    in this paper ,",
    "we present an idea for suppressing the flavor - dependent @xmath0-term contribution to sfermion masses .",
    "the @xmath0-term contribution is generated when one integrates out heavy fields which develop vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) that break the @xmath5 gauge symmetries .",
    "as will be reviewed below , the modification of low - energy spectrum is determined by soft susy - breaking masses of the heavy fields .",
    "our idea is that the @xmath0-term contribution is suppressed if the soft masses of the heavy fields can be made small .",
    "we will present illustrative models where this idea is realized in a dynamical or geometrical way . unlike other approaches , the models presented here have an advantage that origins of the yukawa hierarchy can be addressed within the same framework .",
    "however , even if the dominant @xmath0-term contribution is suppressed , there still remains a flavor - violating effect from the @xmath5 gauge symmetries ; flavor - dependent scalar masses are radiatively generated by @xmath5 gaugino loop graphs , which involve the gaugino - fermion - sfermion vertices proportional to @xmath5 quantum numbers .",
    "such radiative effect is described in terms of renormalization - group equations ( rges ) for scalar masses . unlike the above tree - level @xmath0-term contribution ,",
    "the gaugino loop effect does not depend on susy - breaking scalar masses .",
    "therefore even with reduced @xmath0-term contribution , e.g.  by assuming the universal sparticle spectrum , flavor violation from the @xmath5 flavor symmetries still remains and turns to be detectable signatures for flavor physics .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe scalar masses in supersymmetric theories with a gauged abelian flavor symmetry .",
    "in addition to the @xmath0-term contribution , we point out subleading but sizable flavor violation due to the abelian gaugino . in section 3",
    ", we will discuss how to suppress the dominant @xmath0-term flavor violation .",
    "after a brief survey of the existing proposals in section 3.1 , we present in section 3.2 the models with extra dimensions , while another model based on four - dimensional superconformal dynamics is presented in section 3.3 .",
    "we also examine how much degeneracy of sfermion masses is expected in these models . in section 4 ,",
    "radiative corrections from the soft gaugino mass are shown to be potentially dangerous and give significant constraints on model parameters such as soft gaugino masses .",
    "section 5 summarizes our results .",
    "in this section , we discuss sfermion masses in the presence of a @xmath5 horizontal gauge symmetry , denoted by @xmath6 throughout this paper .",
    "the @xmath0-term effect has been considered in various contexts  @xcite . as simple examples , we study two types of models where a non - vanishing vev of the auxiliary component @xmath0 of @xmath6 vector multiplet is actually generated",
    ". however the properties presented here are generic for any model of @xmath0-term contribution .    as the first example , let us consider a pseudo - anomalous abelian gauge symmetry , which often appears in string models  @xcite . in this case",
    ", the fayet - iliopoulos ( fi ) term is generated by a non - vanishing vev of the dilaton or moduli field , whose nonlinear shift cancels the @xmath6 anomaly .",
    "we treat the coefficient of the fi term as a constant , for simplicity .-",
    "term contribution becomes different from that in softly - broken global susy models with a constant fi term .",
    "the suppression mechanism presented in this paper should be reconsidered in such a case . ]",
    "the supersymmetric scalar potential relevant to the @xmath6 gauge sector is written as @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the gauge coupling and @xmath9 is the coefficient of the fi term , which we take positive without lose of generality .",
    "the @xmath6 charges of scalars @xmath10 and @xmath11 are denoted as @xmath12 @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath0 is @xmath16 then in the supersymmetric limit @xmath17 , the negatively - charged fields @xmath11 generally develop nonzero vevs and the abelian gauge symmetry is broken at @xmath18 @xmath19 .",
    "the scalar fields with vanishing vevs remain massless but @xmath11 decouple around the @xmath18 scale .    in this work",
    ", we assume that the @xmath6 breaking scale @xmath18 @xmath19 is smaller than a cutoff @xmath20 of the theory .",
    "it is known  @xcite that the ratio @xmath21 can be an origin of the hierarchy of yukawa couplings .",
    "consider , for example , a superpotential @xmath22 includes the following non - renormalizable operators @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the electroweak higgs field , and @xmath25 is a negatively - charged field that develops a nonzero vev of order @xmath26 .",
    "the power @xmath27 is determined by the @xmath6 charge conservation to be @xmath28 .",
    "the operators ( [ fnspot ] ) induce the effective yukawa couplings @xmath29 the factor @xmath30 represents a unit of hierarchy of yukawa couplings and is usually taken to be of the order of the cabibbo angle . in this way , a realistic hierarchy of low - energy yukawa couplings can be obtained by assigning different charges to matter fields @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "we add a remark on possible realization of the fn mechanism in weakly - coupled heterotic string models . in this case , the @xmath5 anomaly is cancelled by a nonlinear shift of the dilaton - axion multiplet  @xcite , and the fi term @xmath32 is generated at loop level .",
    "consequently @xmath32 naturally has an appropriate size for the yukawa hierarchy .",
    "this possibility provides us with a strong motivation for regarding an anomalous @xmath5 as a gauged flavor symmetry .",
    "note also that in the case of anomalous @xmath5 symmetry , the axion - gauge mixing generates an additional contribution to the gauge boson mass , @xmath33 .",
    "since this contribution is suppressed by @xmath34 compared with that from the scalar vev @xmath35 , we will neglect this effect in our analysis below .",
    "the susy vacuum is shifted when soft susy - breaking masses for scalars are introduced . the scalar potential is now given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are arbitrary mass parameters .",
    "the ellipsis denotes other susy - breaking terms irrelevant to our analysis . in @xmath39 ,",
    "the @xmath0 component is replaced with scalar fields through the equation of motion ( [ deom ] ) . minimizing the potential with respect to negatively - charged fields",
    ", we find that the @xmath0 component obtains a vev @xmath40 in this expression , @xmath41 is the minimum value of @xmath42 in the model , since the effective potential around the minimum along the @xmath11 direction takes a value of @xmath43 . without superpotential , only the scalar fields with such minimal value of ratio , @xmath41 , can contribute to the above equation .",
    "for example , in the case of universal scalar masses , ( a combination of ) scalar fields with the largest negative value of @xmath5 charge obtain the vev ( [ dvev ] ) . in this way",
    ", the @xmath0-flat direction is lifted by susy - breaking masses of scalar fields with negative quantum numbers . from eqs .",
    "( [ vsusy ] ) and ( [ dvev ] ) , one finds a formula for the @xmath0-term contribution to the masses of light scalars : @xmath44    the most important property of the formula ( [ dcont ] ) is that the induced scalar masses squared are proportional to their @xmath6 charges .",
    "this fact gives a significant implication to flavor physics .",
    "as explained above , realistic low - energy yukawa couplings are generated by assigning different charges to matter fields .",
    "if all susy - breaking masses are of the same order of magnitude , this scalar mass difference leads to large fcnc amplitudes .",
    "for example , lepton - flavor violation from flavor symmetry @xmath0-terms was discussed in  @xcite .    besides the flavor problems , the induced scalar masses ( [ dcont ] ) have several interesting properties .",
    "firstly , the contribution is independent of the @xmath6 gauge coupling constant @xmath8 . therefore the formula ( [ dcont ] ) remains valid even if @xmath8 is small .",
    "[ note , however , that the complete global limit ( @xmath45 ) can not be taken since the @xmath6 symmetry is broken only if the condition @xmath46 is satisfied so that the scalar potential ( [ v ] ) is unstable around the origin of the moduli space . ] secondly , the @xmath0-term contribution does not depend on the symmetry - breaking scale @xmath18 , either .",
    "the @xmath0-term contribution is proportional to a tiny deviation from supersymmetric conditions ( flat directions ) , and the deviation is determined by supersymmetry breaking independently of the gauge symmetry breaking  @xcite . as a result of these properties ,",
    "the scalar masses induced via the @xmath0 term appear for any value of gauge coupling and symmetry - breaking scale .- term contribution is absent if soft masses arise only at low energy as in the gauge mediation of susy breaking  @xcite .",
    "this can be seen from the fact that , to correctly determine the scalar vevs , one has to use the renormalization - group improved potential  @xcite in which all running parameters are evaluated at the vev scale .",
    "] it is also found from ( [ dcont ] ) that the normalization of @xmath6 charges does not affect the size of @xmath0-term contribution .",
    "the @xmath0-term contribution also appears for non - anomalous abelian gauge symmetries .",
    "here we consider a model which contains vector - like fields @xmath47 and @xmath48 with @xmath6 charges @xmath49 , and a gauge singlet @xmath50 . taking a renormalizable and gauge - invariant superpotential @xmath51 and introducing soft susy - breaking terms",
    ", we obtain at the minimum of the scalar potential a vev @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the soft scalar masses of @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively . if one introduces an @xmath55 symmetry under which the singlet @xmath50 has charge @xmath56 , the superpotential ( [ superpot ] ) is the most generic one .",
    "the abelian gauge symmetry is broken at @xmath57 .",
    "the result ( [ diff ] ) is not modified even if one stabilizes scalar fields with other types of superpotentials .",
    "when the theory contains a chiral multiplet with a charge @xmath12 , the induced mass for its scalar component is given by @xmath58 this has the same form as in eq .",
    "( [ dcont ] ) and shares the properties discussed above with the anomalous @xmath5 case .",
    "note that in this model the @xmath0-term contribution vanishes as long as soft scalar masses are universal .",
    "however unless the exact universality is a result of symmetries of models , the degenerate spectrum is expected to be split by radiative corrections governed by renormalization - group ( rg ) evolutions",
    ". then non - vanishing @xmath0-terms are generated .    in this way",
    ", the @xmath0-term contribution generically appears in supersymmetric models with abelian gauge symmetries .",
    "we note that abelian gauge factors always appear when the rank of gauge group is reduced through gauge symmetry breaking , e.g.  as in grand unified theories ( guts ) .",
    "for example , there are several proposals for realistic yukawa matrices where matter multiplets of different generations belong to different representations of gut gauge group  @xcite .",
    "after gauge symmetry breaking , non - vanishing vevs of abelian @xmath0 components induce violation of flavor universality .",
    "one important notice in this case is that the @xmath6 gauge couplings can not be arbitrarily small because they are unified into gut gauge group which also contains the sm ones .",
    "in this work , we focus on the effects of @xmath6 gauge symmetry on the scalars with the same quantum numbers of the sm gauge symmetry .",
    "we neglect effects from yukawa interactions .",
    "this is justified for the light generations , for which the experimental constraints are severe .",
    "when one includes the third generation with large yukawa couplings ( e.g.  for top quark ) , flavor violation generated by these yukawa couplings may be large .",
    "experimental constraints are , however , still weak for the third generation and will be a target of next generation of experiments .",
    "we leave it to future investigations .",
    "the scalar mass under consideration generally takes the form @xmath59 at the flavor symmetry breaking scale @xmath18 .",
    "the first term on the right - handed side is an initial value of the scalar mass .",
    "this part is expected to be generated by susy - breaking dynamics and its structure is highly model - dependent . to focus on the @xmath6 part",
    ", we take an assumption that @xmath60 are not dominant sources of flavor violation . in",
    "what follows , @xmath60 are taken to be generation - independent for simplicity , but this assumption is not necessary in our concrete models in section 3.2 .",
    "the second term @xmath61 contains the effects from all flavor - blind gauge interactions such as gut or sm ones . for example , the rg evolution due to soft gaugino masses is described as @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the gauge coupling constant and soft gaugino mass of the @xmath65 gauge sector , respectively .",
    "the scale @xmath66 denotes the renormalization point and @xmath67 is the quadratic casimir of @xmath65 for the corresponding scalar in the representation @xmath55 .",
    "in addition , there is another type of gauge contribution if the theory includes a generation - independent abelian factor like the sm hypercharge .",
    "that introduces @xmath0-term contribution and the tr(@xmath68 ) term in scalar mass rges .",
    "it is potentially important that low - energy sparticle spectrum is modified in the presence of such extra @xmath5 symmetries .",
    "generation - blind but intergeneration - dependent @xmath0-term contribution has been investigated in various contexts  @xcite . in rg evolutions of scalar masses ,",
    "the net effect is to shift the low - energy value of hypercharge @xmath0 term which is proportional to tr(@xmath69 ) .",
    "all of these contributions just scale overall magnitude of soft scalar masses and therefore are harmless to the flavor problems .",
    "the remaining two factors , the third and last terms in ( [ softmass ] ) , are possible flavor - violating terms associated with the @xmath6 gauge symmetry .",
    "the form of @xmath70 was given in the previous section , @xmath71 the vev @xmath72 is written in terms of scalar vevs which break the flavor gauge symmetry , and the scalar vevs are determined by their soft masses . on the other hand , the last term represents radiative corrections via rges from the @xmath6 gauge interactions and is explicitly given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the @xmath6 soft gaugino mass , @xmath75 is the charge operator , and the trace is taken over all scalar fields charged under the @xmath6 symmetry .",
    "the second term in ( [ mx ] ) is generally non - vanishing for the case of non - universal soft scalar masses and also for anomalous @xmath6 case even with universal scalar masses .",
    "however it should be noted that the masses squared @xmath76 of symmetry - breaking scalars @xmath11 are also affected by the same factor @xmath77 in rg evolutions .",
    "that is , @xmath76 evaluated at the scale @xmath18 contains a term @xmath78 interestingly , when substituted into the formula ( [ dcont ] ) , this contribution exactly cancels the second term in ( [ mx ] ) .",
    "the same is true for non - anomalous @xmath5 cases , ( 2.10 ) .",
    "therefore we can safely drop this type of effects in the following analysis and concentrate on the first term in ( [ mx ] ) .",
    "we here comment on characteristic features of two flavor - violating contributions from abelian gauge dynamics , @xmath70 and @xmath79 .",
    "they have rather different properties from each other .",
    "the @xmath0-term contribution @xmath70 is the dominant , tree - level source of flavor violation from the gauged flavor symmetry .",
    "the induced masses squared of light scalars are linearly proportional to their @xmath6 charges , but independent of the gauge coupling strength and the symmetry - breaking scale . on the other hand , @xmath79 is the gaugino radiative correction and depends on the values of gauge coupling and symmetry - breaking scale . as a result , although loop - suppressed , this sub - dominant contribution can be enhanced and become comparable with @xmath70 .",
    "moreover , @xmath79 does not depend on the magnitude of soft scalar masses , unlike @xmath70 .",
    "this fact implies that even if the apparently dominant contribution @xmath70 were suppressed , for example , by taking the universality assumption , @xmath79 is left unchanged and becomes the main source of flavor violation . combining these two properties of @xmath79",
    ", we find that the @xmath6 gaugino effect is an interesting and unexplored effect in supersymmetric models with flavor @xmath6 symmetries .",
    "this issue will be discussed in section 4 .",
    "the aim of this section is to discuss how to suppress the tree - level @xmath0-term contribution which is known to be a dominant source of flavor violation with @xmath5 flavor symmetry .",
    "we first mention several possible approaches to the @xmath0 problem , some of which have been discussed in the literature .",
    "our concrete models will be presented in sections 3.2 and 3.3 .",
    "a well - known solution to the susy flavor problems is to take @xmath70 very large , i.e.  of the order of @xmath80 tev  @xcite . with such heavy scalars , flavor- and cp - violating processes involving these fields",
    "are suppressed by their large masses and do not lead to any severe constraints on susy - breaking parameters .",
    "it is also interesting that together with the fn mechanism , a larger @xmath6 charge simultaneously leads to a larger scalar mass and a smaller yukawa coupling .",
    "this is precisely the situation relevant to the first and second generations on which the experimental constraints are severer .",
    "this elegant solution , however , suffers from some unsatisfactory points , including the destabilization of the true electroweak vacuum at two - loop level  @xcite , fine - tuning of parameters required for the cp - violation constraints  @xcite , etc .",
    "this solution also rules out supersymmetry as a possible explanation of the experimental result for the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon .",
    "the @xmath0 problem becomes less severe if one assigns the same @xmath6 charge to the matter fields in the same representation under the sm gauge symmetry .",
    "it was pointed out that universal charges for three - generation left - handed leptons can explain the large flavor mixing observed at the neutrino experiments ( but with a bit large value of @xmath81 matrix element  @xcite ) . within the fn mechanism ,",
    "however , this could only be applied to the lepton sector .",
    "mass hierarchy and small flavor mixing in the quark sector are realized by assigning different @xmath6 quantum numbers .",
    "another possibility is a cancellation of @xmath70 with other contributions to scalar masses .",
    "an obvious choice comes from superpotential @xmath82-terms .",
    "it has been argued that @xmath82- and @xmath0-term effects add up to zero in specific situations  @xcite .",
    "a cancellation may occur in @xmath0-term itself if there are several scalar fields developing non - vanishing vevs .",
    "however cancellation of more than one flavor - violating effects seems unnatural unless it follows from some underlying mechanism .",
    "now , there is a simple and natural possibility which , to our knowledge , has not been addressed in the literature . as was seen in the previous section ,",
    "the @xmath0-term contribution is proportional to a deviation from the @xmath0-flat direction , and such deviation is determined by the soft masses of the scalars that acquire flavor symmetry - breaking vevs .",
    "accordingly , if these soft masses can be reduced , the @xmath0-flat direction is not lifted and @xmath0-term contributions become negligible . it is this possibility that we shall pursue in the following part of this section .",
    "we will present two illustrative examples where our idea can be realized .",
    "the point is to separate the @xmath6-breaking sector from the susy - breaking sector .",
    "we construct toy models in which this separation is achieved in a geometrical or dynamical way . in what follows , we assume , for simplicity of presentations , that only a single field @xmath83 obtains a vev of the @xmath6 flavor symmetry breaking .",
    "we now describe how our idea of suppressing @xmath0-term contributions can be realized by considering a suitable field configuration in higher - dimensional spacetime . for definiteness",
    ", we consider a five - dimensional theory and suppose that there are two four - dimensional branes at different positions in the fifth dimension ; the visible - sector matter fields , i.e.  quarks and leptons , are assumed to be confined on one brane , while supersymmetry breaking occurs on another brane ( called the hidden brane ) . as was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , this setup naturally explains the absence of uncontrollable gravity - mediated effects including large flavor - violating ones , provided that there is no light mode whose wavelength is longer than the distance between the two branes .",
    "this is one of the most attractive points of considering the presence of additional dimensions .",
    "however the @xmath0-term contribution to scalar masses can be added  @xcite . if flavor @xmath6 gauge symmetries are introduced in this framework , suppressing their @xmath0 terms is required .",
    "we apply the idea of geometrical splitting to separate the flavor symmetry - breaking sector from susy - breaking one .",
    "specifically we require that , in addition to the quarks and leptons , the @xmath83 field is also confined to the visible brane .",
    "this is a setup crucial for our scenarios .",
    "we further suppose that the @xmath6 vector multiplet is also confined on the visible brane .",
    "this is just a technical assumption for simplifying discussion .",
    "if @xmath6 is put in the bulk , the supersymmetric five - dimensional abelian gauge theory has a rich structure of vacua , which requires complicated analyses .",
    "we do not pursue this possibility in this paper . on the other hand , there are two choices for the sm gauge sector ; on the visible brane or in the bulk .",
    "first let us consider the sm gauge multiplets on the visible brane . in this case ,",
    "all the sm fields and @xmath83 are on the visible brane .",
    "though couplings to the hidden brane are suppressed , soft terms do not completely vanish .",
    "it has been shown that susy - breaking effects are transmitted at loop level to the visible sector via superconformal anomaly  @xcite .",
    "the anomaly - mediated spectrum is roughly given by @xmath84     m_{\\lambda_x } \\;\\sim\\ ; \\displaystyle{\\frac{g_x^2}{16\\pi^2}m_{3/2 } } ,    & & m_\\chi^2 \\;\\sim\\ ;     \\bigg(\\displaystyle{\\frac{g_x^2}{16\\pi^2}m_{3/2}}\\bigg)^2 ,    \\label{3am } \\end{array}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the gaugino masses , sfermion masses , and the gauge coupling constants , respectively , all in the sm sector , and @xmath88 is the gravitino mass .",
    "notice that the absence of tree - level contribution to @xmath89 is guaranteed in our setup thanks to the separation of @xmath83 from susy breaking .",
    "moreover the singlet @xmath83 receives only the soft scalar mass squared proportional to @xmath90 . therefore with a sufficiently small value of the gauge coupling @xmath8 , @xmath91 is negligibly small which in turn implies that the @xmath0-term contribution is suppressed .- term contribution is offset by threshold corrections at leading order  @xcite .",
    "] actually enough suppression of @xmath0-term flavor violations requires a condition roughly estimated as @xmath92 the factor @xmath93 denotes an order of tuning in the sfermion masses in order to satisfy the constraints from flavor physics experiments . for example , a limit from the @xmath94-@xmath95 mixing phenomena implies @xmath96 .",
    "this constraint is satisfied with a natural value of @xmath8 comparable to @xmath87 .",
    "another interesting pattern of spectrum is obtained by assuming that the sm gauge multiplets reside in the five - dimensional bulk and other fields are stuck on the visible brane . this situation ( for the sm sector )",

    "( [ softmass ] ) ] and the last term is that of anomaly mediation .",
    "the both terms are generation - independent .",

    "the sc fixed points also have an interesting implication for susy breaking .",

    "then strongly - coupled sc dynamics suppresses the soft mass of @xmath83 and consequently the @xmath0-term contribution to charged sfermion masses . in the following ,",
    "we suppose for simplicity that the sc sector does not couple to the sm fields ; the hierarchical structure of yukawa couplings are generated by the conventional fn mechanism .",
    "now , we present a toy model by introducing a sc gauge group @xmath104 in addition to the sm gauge and @xmath6 flavor symmetries .",
    "consider the following cubic superpotential term @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath107 belong to non - trivial representations under @xmath104 .",
    "the sm fields are @xmath104-singlets while @xmath83 couples to the sc sector through the above @xmath22 .",
    "the operator @xmath108 has a nonzero @xmath6 charge so that ( [ w ] ) is gauge invariant .",
    "let us suppose that as in section  2 , the sm - singlet field @xmath83 develops a non - vanishing vev @xmath109 which breaks the flavor symmetry and generates effective yukawa couplings through non - renormalizable operators .",
    "an interesting point of the present setup is that the required decoupling of the sc sector is achieved by the same vev @xmath109 , giving a mass term for @xmath106 and @xmath110 .",
    "thus both the sc and @xmath6 sectors decouple from the sm one around the scale of @xmath18 for @xmath111 .",
    "strong @xmath104 interactions force the trilinear coupling @xmath112 as well as the @xmath104 gauge coupling to approach their infrared fixed - point values .",
    "hence the field @xmath83 gains a large and positive anomalous dimension  @xmath113 . for simplicity , we assume that the couplings at a cutoff scale @xmath20 are close to their fixed - point values . if we neglect perturbatively small couplings in the sm sector , susy - breaking scalar masses are suppressed ( near the sc fixed point ) according to the following form of evolution equations  @xcite @xmath114 where the index @xmath115 runs over all fields coupled to the sc sector including the @xmath83 field .",
    "the matrix @xmath116 can be calculated by use of the grassmannian expansion method  @xcite , given the anomalous dimensions @xmath117 as the functions of coupling constants in the model . since @xmath116 is determined by the first derivative of @xmath117 , the infrared convergence property of the fixed points guarantees that this matrix is positive definite .",
    "it follows that certain combinations of scalar masses rapidly become suppressed through the rg evolution from @xmath20 down to the the sc - decoupling scale @xmath109 .",
    "specifically , the scalar mass squared @xmath89 of the @xmath83 field behaves like @xmath118 here the damping factor @xmath119 is related to the eigenvalues of @xmath116 and is as large as @xmath120 . in this way , the required separation of the flavor - breaking sector from the susy - breaking one can be realized by a strong dynamics of four - dimensional sc gauge theory . as a result",
    ", the @xmath0-term contribution can be reduced for any value of susy - breaking parameters at the cutoff scale .",
    "it is important , however , to take into account two effects that make the desired suppression ( [ mchi ] ) insufficient .",
    "one is the violation of sc symmetry due to the @xmath6 gauge interaction ( as well as the sm gauge interactions ) .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion on this point .",
    "if we include the 1-loop correction from the @xmath6 sector , the evolution equation ( [ ee ] ) is modified into @xmath121 note that a model - dependent factor proportional to @xmath122 can safely be dropped in discussing @xmath0-term induced scalar masses , as was shown in section  2.2 .",
    "the above type of correction makes the suppression of @xmath89 incomplete , but obviously such rg effect is less significant if the gauge coupling @xmath8 and soft gaugino mass @xmath74 are not so large .",
    "another and more significant effect comes from the fact that the rg running distance in the sc regime is finite .",
    "this effect is more important than the previous one because the running distance is related to the hierarchy of yukawa couplings . in the fn models ( [ fnspot ] ) , the effective yukawa couplings @xmath123 at the sc - decoupling scale",
    "are now suppressed , in addition to the usual factor @xmath124 , by the large wavefunction renormalization of @xmath83 and are given by @xmath125 thus the degrees of suppression for yukawa couplings and scalar masses are correlated to each other . in particular , it is a non - trivial issue whether @xmath89 becomes small enough to suppress fcnc with a fixed yukawa hierarchy @xmath126 , i.e.  with a fixed length of the sc region . given a value of @xmath126 , the @xmath83 scalar mass ( [ mchi ] ) is written as @xmath127 the deviation ( [ dev ] ) from the exact convergence to the conformal fixed point generates the @xmath0-term contribution to sfermion masses .",
    "that implies the fcnc constraint for the first and second generation squarks @xmath128",
    "\\;{\\mathop{}_{\\textstyle \\sim}^{\\textstyle < } } \\ ;     10^{-2}\\bigg(\\frac{m_{\\rm ave}}{500\\ , { \\rm gev}}\\bigg),\\ ] ] where the extra factor of @xmath129 arises when we diagonalize the quark mass matrices .",
    "the averaged squark mass @xmath130 contains initial values of squark masses at high energy and radiative corrections from the sm gauginos .",
    "the above constraint requires that the damping factor @xmath119 has an appropriately large value .",
    "otherwise , the @xmath0 problem will still be there ; a high - energy value of @xmath89 has to be small compared to other susy - breaking parameters .",
    "similar remarks apply also to the slepton sector .    in this way , suppressing the @xmath0-term can in principle be achieved within four - dimensional framework , but for the mechanism discussed in this subsection to work in practice , it is necessary to have a concrete model of the sc sector in which @xmath119 is as large as possible whereas @xmath113 is a reasonably small .",
    "in the previous section , we have discussed the dominant tree - level @xmath0-term contribution which must be suppressed for models to be phenomenologically viable .",
    "we have illustrated that the suppression can be achieved by use of four - dimensional sc dynamics as well as a geometrical setup in extra - dimensional scenarios .",
    "it is , however , important to notice that even if the @xmath0-term contribution is sufficiently reduced , radiative corrections due to the @xmath6 gaugino may lead to sizable non - degeneracy of sfermion masses , because the corrections depend on their quantum numbers and then become flavor - dependent . as shown in section 2.2 ,",
    "the only relevant type of radiative corrections comes from the @xmath6 soft gaugino mass . in this section",
    ", we study this type of corrections , supposing that tree - level @xmath0-term contribution is already suppressed .",

    "the second term is obtained through the @xmath0-term contribution with the rge effect on @xmath89 included . since the scalar masses ( [ mxi ] ) are the only sources of flavor dependence , the mass difference between the scalars with different quantum numbers @xmath12 and @xmath132 is scale invariant and found to be @xmath133 .",

    "we have only discussed flavor - violating scalar masses induced by gauged abelian flavor symmetries .",

    "we have presented a simple idea for suppressing the @xmath0-term contribution ; a separation of flavor - symmetry breaking from supersymmetry breaking .",
    "illustrative models have been described by extra - dimensional frameworks or strongly - coupled superconformal dynamics .",
    "we have also pointed out that generation - dependent radiative corrections due to the @xmath5 soft gaugino mass lead to sizable non - degeneracy in sfermion masses .",
    "the corrections are also dangerous to the fcnc constraints and put a non - trivial limit on the parameters in the flavor symmetry sector .",
    "our analysis indicates that it is preferable to have the @xmath5 gauge coupling and soft gaugino mass as small as possible .",
    "required small values of parameters could be obtained , for example in extra - dimensional models , by volume suppression factors or strong rge effects .",
