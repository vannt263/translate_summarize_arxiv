    "in two recent papers we have discussed the scaling properties of the large @xmath1 distributions of @xmath0 produced in au+au collisions at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) and presented their implications . as reported in the first paper @xcite , hereafter referred to as i , we found energy scaling at maximum centrality , while in the second paper @xcite , referred to as ii , we found centrality scaling at the highest energy .",
    "the two can be combined to yield one scaling distribution for all energy and centrality . in i",
    "we derive the quark distribution from the @xmath0 data in the framework of the recombination model ; we now do the same for all centralities and determine the nature of degradation of the quark momentum in the dense medium , as we have done for the @xmath0 momentum in ii . from the quark distribution",
    "we can calculate the proton distribution for all centralities .",
    "moreover , we can extend our consideration to the production of kaons so that we can calculate not only the @xmath2 ratio , but also the @xmath3 ratio .",
    "we are able to do all that for two essential reasons .",
    "the first is that the discovery of the scaling properties facilitates the analysis by avoiding the need to consider the variation of physics issues at different centralities and energies .",
    "the other is that the quark distribution we derive is for @xmath4 and @xmath5 just before hadronization .",
    "it is not the result of some dynamical evolution starting from hard collisions , for which many complex issues must be considered @xcite .",
    "the recombination model that we use can only address the hadronization problem of the soft partons at low virtuality , but at any @xmath1 . from the pion data we infer the distributions of the soft @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which in turn are used to give the proton and kaon distributions through recombination .",
    "how the soft partons get to be where they are in the @xmath1 space is not considered . however , by studying the momentum degradation of the quarks , we gain from the centrality dependence of the @xmath1 distributions some understanding about how quarks lose momenta as they propagate through the dense medium .",
    "experimentally verifiable predictions are made on the proton and kaon transverse momentum distributions .",
    "the physical interpretation of the scaling variable is given at the very end , where the term transversity is suggested to refer to the difficulty of acquiring transverse motion .",
    "the broader implication on the creation of quark - gluon plasma is finally addressed .",
    "from the preliminary phenix data of @xmath0 production in au+au collisions at rhic @xcite we have found a scaling distribution at midrapidity @xmath6 where @xmath7 the symbol @xmath8 denotes the number of participants , @xmath9 , for brevity .",
    "the scaling factor @xmath10 is first found in i for @xmath8 fixed at its maximum , @xmath11 , to be ( in gev / c ) @xmath12 where @xmath13 is in units of gev , and @xmath14 is normalized to 1 at @xmath15 gev .",
    "when @xmath8 is allowed to vary , while @xmath13 is fixed at 200 gev , it is found in ii that the scaling factor is @xmath16 normalized to 1 at @xmath17 .",
    "we now combine the two and assume the factorizable form @xmath18 in this paper we investigate the centrality dependence mostly at @xmath15 gev .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) is found in ii to have a power - law dependence on the number of binary collisions , @xmath20 , @xmath21 where @xmath20 in turn depends on @xmath8 as @xmath22 a relationship that is determined from the tables listed in refs.@xcite .     and",
    "200 gev are preliminary and were presented by phenix @xcite for au+au collisions .",

    "the @xmath0 data , which are only for @xmath25 gev / c , are supplemented by the @xmath26 data for @xmath27 gev / c at @xmath15 gev and 0 - 5% centrality @xcite . evidently , all the data points fall on one universal scaling distribution that is invariant under changes in @xmath8 and @xmath13 .",
    "the 17 gev data are obtained by the wa98 collaboration @xcite for pb+pb collisions and show a slight departure from the universal curve for @xmath28 .",
    "it should be recognized that those data points that deviate from the scaling distribution correspond to @xmath29 gev / c , which is a @xmath1 range that represents a very large fraction of the total available energy of 17 gev .",
    "thus the kinematic constraint of energy conservation introduces a non - dynamical factor that suppresses the high-@xmath1 behavior , not present in the other data at @xmath30130 gev .",
    "such a violation of scaling is expected , and should not be regarded as an invalidation of the general scaling behavior we observe . on the contrary , it is amazing that the scaling behavior can cover such a wide range of @xmath13 , when most of the 17 gev data points with @xmath31 gev / c are included .",
    "the scaling data points can be well fitted by @xcite @xmath32 which is shown by the solid line in fig .  1 .",
    "this formula differs from the one given in i mainly by the addition of the exponential term , which reflects the statistical behavior at small @xmath33 represented by the @xmath26 data , but is insignificant at large @xmath33 , where the power - law behavior is indicative of the effects of hard collisions .",
    "a number of consequences of the scaling distribution , eq.([8 ] ) , can be examined directly .",
    "first , the integral @xmath34 can be evaluated to yield @xmath35 .",
    "using eqs .",

    "we plot in that figure in solid line our calculated result for @xmath39 , which is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) by identifying @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",
    "since @xmath42 is the dominant part of all charged particles , one should regard the comparison between the calculated @xmath43 and the measured @xmath44 to be satisfactory . recall that although the @xmath2 ratio can exceed 1 around @xmath45 gev / c , it is small at small @xmath1 where the distributions are dominant , so the production of proton does not contribute to the integrated result as a large fraction of the total @xmath46 .",
    "compared to the data on @xmath38 @xcite.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    another consequence of @xmath23 is the possibility to calculate the nuclear modification factor @xmath47 the data available for that are given in ref .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "3 the data for two centrality bins : 0 - 10% and 70 - 80% .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath8 are 317 and 9.5 , respectively @xcite , for which the calculated @xmath48 are shown by the solid and dash - dot lines . for @xmath49 in the denominator of eq .",

    "the ratio @xmath48 is defined with @xmath49 in the denominator so as to have a definitive experimental normalization .",
    "we calculate the ratio with @xmath50 in the denominator so that no additional experimental input is used .",
    "our point is to show the consistency of @xmath23 when the value of @xmath8 is extrapolated to extreme limits . toward that end",
    "we find the comparison between the data points and the calculated curves in fig .  3 to be acceptable .     for @xmath0 production .",
    "the preliminary data are from phenix @xcite .",
    "the lines are calculated results using @xmath50 extrapolation of @xmath23 for normalization rather than using independent @xmath51 distribution.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the scaling distribution @xmath23 is a representation of the data over 9 orders of magnitude for all centralities and for all energies where data exist . since the fit is done in the log scale in fig .  1",
    ", one can expect some deviations in the linear scale , as the tests in figs .",
    "2 and 3 are done .",
    "the data must , of course , be self - consistent , so any discrepencies in those figures are due to the extrapolation of @xmath23 to very small @xmath33 in the calculation of @xmath37 and to very small @xmath8 for @xmath52 . we conclude from those tests that the formula ( [ 8 ] ) for @xmath23 is quite reliable even down to very small values of @xmath33 and @xmath8 .",
    "from the scaling distribution of @xmath0 it is possible to derive the quark distribution in the framework of the recombination model .",
    "those quarks have low virtuality ( hence , soft ) and are at the last stage of their existence just before hadronization .",
    "they are not to be confused with the partons at high virtuality ( hence , hard ) just after hard collisions .",
    "the evolution from the hard partons to the soft quarks through gluon radiation and conversion to quark pairs in the dense medium involve both perturbative and non - perturbative qcd processes that are complicated , only some of which can be calculated @xcite .",
    "the last step to hadrons is circumvented by use of the phenomenological fragmentation function that connects hard partons to hadrons directly .",
    "our use of the recombination model treats only the last step from soft quarks to hadrons , and can make no statement about the evolutionary process that begins from hard collisions .",
    "what can be treated is how the soft quarks recombine in different combinations to form different hadrons .",
    "that is what we shall do in the following sections .",
    "here we first derive the quark distributions and examine how they depend on centrality .",
    "the application of the recombination model @xcite to the high @xmath1 problem has been discussed in i. the recombination of a @xmath4 and a @xmath5 to form a @xmath0 , where @xmath53 can be either @xmath54 or @xmath55 , but not both @xmath54 and @xmath56 , is described by [ see i - eq .",

    "the amazing answer found in ref.@xcite is that it is only 8% . due to the large number of gluons produced in heavy - ion collisions that is enough to raise the strange quark density by a factor of 2.1 to 2.3 from the intrinsic level in a free proton , depending on collision energy .    to be precise ,",
    "let us use the notation where the symbols @xmath170 and @xmath70 denote the total number of light and strange quarks , respectively , @xmath170 being @xmath171 , in contrast to @xmath4 being @xmath88 or @xmath172 .",
    "let @xmath173 and @xmath174 denote the numbers of valence quarks , light sea quarks , strange quarks and gluons , respectively , before the gluons are converted to @xmath175 and @xmath176 for recombination to form hadrons .",
    "since only the ratios of these numbers will be relevant below , they will be given modulo a common multiplicative factor that need not be specified .",
    "the numbers for rhic at 130 gev are @xcite @xmath177 it is also found that the fraction of gluon conversion to the strange sector is @xmath178 , i.e. , @xmath179 where the subscript @xmath74 denotes converted quarks .",
    "the net strange to light quark ratio after conversion is then @xmath180 setting @xmath181 for simplicity , we have @xmath182 and @xmath183 since @xmath184 the strange quark multiplicity originally at @xmath185 is more than doubled by gluon conversion .",
    "the above consideration is at the quark level .",
    "how that translates to hadron abundance must take into account hyperon production in addition to kaon production , since the effects of associated production can not be ignored .",
    "the problem of partitioning the total strange quark numbers into various channels of strange hadrons competing for those quarks has been treated in ref .",
    "it is found there that the fraction @xmath186 of @xmath70 quark forming @xmath187 and @xmath188 of @xmath189 antiquark forming @xmath167 can be deduced from the data . that is , defining @xmath190 where @xmath191 and @xmath192 denote the numbers of @xmath167 mesons of various types , one has at 130 gev collision energy @xmath193 for the purpose of calculating @xmath194 ratio , let us use @xmath195 to denote the number of @xmath189 quarks to recombine with @xmath88 quark to form @xmath196 , and we have @xmath197 we shall assume that the @xmath33 distribution of the @xmath195 quark is the same , apart from normalization , as that of the @xmath88 quark , so we get @xmath198    in the recombination model we expect the produced @xmath196 to have also a scaling distribution @xmath199 the recombination function for the @xmath167 meson is similar to that of the pion given in i @xmath200 where @xmath201 is the valon distribution in the @xmath167 meson @xcite @xmath202 with @xmath203 . the parameters @xmath204 and @xmath205 are determined from the analysis of @xmath206 collisions and",
    "are found to be @xmath207 and @xmath208 ( see the second paper in ref .",
    "since @xmath196 is the only state in the pseudoscalar octet that has @xmath209 content , we have @xmath210 and thus @xmath211 we now can calculate @xmath212 using eqs .",

    "14 we show @xmath217 for @xmath17 and 200 and @xmath218 gev . since the determination of @xmath186 and @xmath188 in eq .",
    "( [ 50 ] ) is by use of the data on particle ratios , which are not reliable for non - central collisions , we have no confidence in the strangeness enhancement factor deduced when @xmath8 is low . for @xmath219 fig .",
    "14 shows that the @xmath3 ratio is not sensitive to centrality , and only mildly dependent on @xmath1 .",
    "this result awaits direct check by experimental data .",

    "from the scaling distribution @xmath23 obtained from the data on @xmath0 production , we have derived many quantities by use of the recombination model .",
    "they are the distributions of quarks , protons , and kaons , and their respective dependences on centrality .",
    "all that is made possible by the discovery of the universal function @xmath23 valid for all centrality and collision energy .",
    "the scaling variable @xmath33 that unites the @xmath1 dependences for all @xmath8 and @xmath13 quantifies the difficulty of producing transverse motion , and for that interpretation it can be termed _",
    "transversity_. a particle produced at a particular @xmath1 at high @xmath13 has a lower transversity than that of the same particle produced at the same @xmath1 but at a lower @xmath13 , because it is easier in the former case that involves a smaller momentum fraction .",
    "similarly , it is easier to produce a particle at a given high @xmath1 when @xmath8 is low than to do the same at a higher @xmath8 because there is less degradation of the transverse momentum at lower @xmath8 .",
    "thus the former particle has lower transversity than the latter . with this way of viewing transverse motion",
    "we see that it is the transversity of the produced particles that has the universal property at whatever centrality and collision energy .",
    "the quantitative results that we have obtained have their limitations due to the assumptions that we have made .",
    "for example , for the proton @xmath33 distribution we have assumed that @xmath220 is a constant , which has some phenomenological support in that the observed @xmath73 ratio is roughly constant in @xmath1 ; however , that ratio fails to maintain constancy at very peripheral collisions . thus our result is not likely to be valid when @xmath8 is very low . similarly , whether @xmath221 is a constant and over what range of @xmath8 , if it is , are not known .",
    "the centrality dependence of the strangeness fraction of gluon conversion is also unknown .",
    "our result on @xmath3 ratio can therefore only be regarded as preliminary , pending experimental guidance to improve our simplifying assumptions . despite these uncertainties for non - central collisions ,",
    "the recombination model has enabled us to calculate the scaling behavior of the quark , proton , and kaon distributions , the latter two of which are subject to direct experimental test .    for non - central collisions",
    "we have only calculated the @xmath1 distribution , averaged over the azimuthal angle @xmath59 . clearly , the dependence on @xmath59 is important as it contains dynamical information",
    ". it will be very interesting to investigate whether centrality scaling persists in restricted @xmath59 bins , and if it does , how the scaling curves depend on @xmath59 .",
    "on the basis of the universality in transversity distribution , we expect that such @xmath59-dependent scaling curves can be put into an overall @xmath59-independent scaling curve upon rescaling . at the price of lower statistics",
    "this can be checked by appropriate analysis of the @xmath0 production data .    ultimately , the important issue to focus on is the implication of the existence of the scaling behavior on the possible formation of quark - gluon plasma . at this stage of our",
    "understanding a conservative statement that can be made is that the discovery of scaling violation might provide a strong hint for a drastic change of dynamics , possibly associated with a phase transition . without waiting for lhc to enlighten us with that possibility ,",
    "a more urgent issue to settle is why , if the quark - gluon plasma has been created already at existing collision energies , the change of the nature of the dense medium does not affect the scaling behavior that we have found to be universal between 17 and 200 gev .",
    "either the scaling behavior is insensitive to the change , or the change has already occurred at collision energy less than 17 gev .",
    "if both of these alternatives are incorrect , then the only way out is that quark - gluon plasma has not yet been created at rhic .",
    "these are the unintended , but remarkable , consequences of the scaling behavior .",
    "it is thus paramount to understand whether a phase transition can lead to a violation of the scaling behavior found here .",
