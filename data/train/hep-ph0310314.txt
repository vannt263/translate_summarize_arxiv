    "it is well known that cp - violation in @xmath3 mixing is described by the parameter @xmath4 . within the sm",
    ", this parameter is given by box diagrams .",
    "it depends in particular on the ckm matrix elements . on the other hand ,",
    "the experimentally measured parameters are @xmath1 and @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath5 enter the measured ratios of decay amplitudes of kaons into @xmath6 states .",
    "these amplitudes are superpositions of amplitudes @xmath7 of kaon decays into states with definite isospin @xmath8 , @xmath9 are weak amplitudes , @xmath10 are strong rescattering phases(see appendix for details ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 can be expressed as @xcite :    @xmath11    within the sm , @xmath12 originates from the so - called strong penguin diagrams .",
    "amplitude @xmath13 also has an imaginary part which originates from electro - weak penguin diagrams .",
    "that is why @xmath14 .",
    "the ratio @xmath15 is much smaller than @xmath4 and when the fit of the ckm matrix parameters is performed , one equates the experimentally measured value of @xmath16 and theoretical expression for @xmath17 , neglecting the term @xmath18 , see @xcite,@xcite .",
    "in particular it was claimed in @xcite that the contribution of @xmath15 is `` at most a 2% correction to @xmath1 '' .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to take this usually neglected term into account .    in order to estimate the ratio @xmath19 we exploit the fact that it enters the expression for @xmath20@xcite :    @xmath21~,\\ ] ]    where @xmath22 .    the ratio @xmath20 is experimentally measured and great amount of work was done in order to calculate it(see @xcite - @xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "in particular the quantity @xmath18 was computed theoretically using different methods .",
    "we shall use the results of these computations .",
    "we shall imply the following three step procedure for estimating @xmath15 .    at first step",
    "we neglect @xmath12",
    ". then @xmath23 coincides with @xmath24 , and we reproduce the results of @xcite,@xcite .    at second step",
    "we take into account that @xmath25 , but neglect the contribution of ew penguins in eq.([2 ] ) .",
    "then we extract the value of @xmath15 from experimentally measured quantity @xmath20 with the help of eq.([2 ] ) .    at third step",
    "we take into account the contribution of ew penguins : @xmath26 .",
    "the consequence is that one can not extract @xmath15 from eq.([2 ] ) .",
    "so one has to use the results of theoretical computation of @xmath15 .",
    "finally , we perform a fit of ckm matrix parameters , taking the term @xmath15 in eq.([1 ] ) into account and using numerical estimate of it , obtained at step 3 .",
    "the quantities @xmath1 and @xmath4 are related by eq.([1 ] ) . taking into account that the phase of @xmath0 is approximately @xmath27 @xcite ( see also appendix ) , from eq.([1 ] ) we deduce :    @xmath28    thus :    @xmath29    the experimentally measured value is @xcite :    latexmath:[\\[\\label{33 }     now we start our procedure of estimating @xmath17 .",
    "we neglect @xmath18 and obtain :    latexmath:[\\[\\label{4 }     this formula is always used in the fits of ckm matrix parameters , see @xcite,@xcite .    :",
    "we take into account that @xmath25 but neglect @xmath32 .",
    "then eq.([2 ] ) reduces to :    @xmath33    taking into account that @xmath34 @xcite , we obtain the following expression for @xmath15 :    @xmath35    substituting experimental values from @xcite we get : @xmath36    in this way we get the following value of @xmath37 , which is the result of the second step :    latexmath:[\\[\\label{8 }     this number coincides with the value obtained in @xcite , eqs.(9.3),(9.4 ) .    : now let us take into account the presence of ew penguins : @xmath26 . then eq.([2 ] ) does not allow to extract @xmath15 from the experimental data and we need explicit theoretical result for @xmath15 .",
    "as announced in the introduction , such result was obtained in the literature while calculating theoretically @xmath20 .    in order to calculate @xmath20 from eq.([2 ] ) , one needs theoretical expressions for @xmath12 and @xmath32 ( the values of @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath16 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are well measured experimentally ) .",
    "short review of the history of @xmath20 calculation can be found in @xcite .",
    "the expressions for @xmath12 and @xmath32 are usually presented in the following form :    @xmath43    where    @xmath44    here @xmath45 and @xmath46 are ckm matrix elements , @xmath47 - fermi constant , @xmath48 are matrix elements of 4-quark operators responsible for @xmath49 decays , @xmath50 being their wilson coefficients , @xmath51 introduces a correction due to isospin breaking effects : @xmath52 .",
    "from ( [ 9 ] ) we have :    @xmath53",
    "this formula contains the ckm matrix elements ( which we are going to fit ) , but for the estimate of the small correction to @xmath54 we can use mean values from @xcite : @xmath55 .",
    "@xmath39 is well measured experimentally : @xmath56 .",
    "concerning @xmath57 , we use data from the calculations of @xmath20 done in @xcite , which succeed in describing the experimental value of @xmath20 .    hadronic matrix elements were evaluated in @xcite using large @xmath58 - expansion . from table 2 of @xcite",
    "we find the following range of values ( corresponding to the quark condensate value @xmath59 at @xmath60 ) : @xmath61 .    substituting this into ( [ 10 ] )",
    "we get : @xmath62 .",
    "this leads to the following range of values for @xmath54 :    @xmath63    we have taken the paper @xcite as an example , and similar estimates can be made using other results , obtained in the framework of @xmath20 calculation ( see @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "the range of values for @xmath17 presented in eq.([11 ] ) can be written as :    @xmath64 to perform the fit of the parameters of ckm matrix . as we see",
    "the value of @xmath37 is larger than that obtained at step 1 by @xmath65 .",
    "we use in our fit of the ckm matrix experimentally measured values of modulus of matrix elements @xmath66,@xmath67,@xmath68,@xmath69,@xmath70 , @xmath71 and also @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "we assume these experimentally measured data to be normally distributed .",
    "also the theoretical uncertainties are treated as normally distributed .",
    "let us note that other people treat theoretical uncertainties in other way @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the most precise determination of @xmath75 comes from the averaging data from nuclear and neutron @xmath76 decays @xcite : @xmath77    from kaon semileptonic decays the element @xmath78 is determined with the better accuracy than in other methods ( like hyperon semileptonic decays ) .",
    "we use the recent value @xcite : @xmath79    from the inclusive and exclusive @xmath80-decays governed by the transition @xmath81 we get @xcite :    @xmath82    the element @xmath83 was measured in deep inelastic scattering of neutrinos and anti - neutrinos on nucleons with charm production @xcite : @xmath84    the best accuracy in @xmath85 comes from the measurement of the ratio of hadronic @xmath86-decays to leptonic @xmath86-decays @xcite : @xmath87    the averaged value of @xmath88 extracted from exclusive and inclusive semileptonic @xmath80-decays including @xmath89 quark is @xcite : @xmath90    theoretical expression for @xmath91 valid for @xmath92 was first obtained in @xcite . in modern notations",
    "it looks like : @xmath93+\\eta_{tt } s(x_t , x_t ) im[(v_{ts } v^*_{td})^2]\\nonumber\\\\    & & + 2\\eta_{ct } s(x_c , x_t )   im[v_{cs } v^*_{cd } v_{ts } v^*_{td } ] ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , the @xmath94 are usually called the inami - lim functions @xcite : @xmath95,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath96 depend on the masses of @xmath89 quark and @xmath97 quark ( @xmath98 gev@xcite , @xmath99 gev @xcite , @xmath100 gev @xcite ) .",
    "the qcd corrections have been calculated to next - to - leading order : @xmath101 @xcite , @xmath102 @xcite , @xmath103 @xcite .",

    "should be extracted : @xmath113 where @xmath114 @xcite is a qcd correction , @xmath115 gev @xcite is the @xmath80 meson mass , @xmath116 is the @xmath86 boson mass , @xmath117 is the inami - lim function for the box diagram , @xmath118 , @xmath119 is the @xmath80 meson decay constant , and @xmath120 is the so - called bag factor .",
    "we use the following numerical value : @xmath121 mev @xcite",
    ".    from @xmath80 decays to cp eigenstates containing charmonium and neutral k - meson @xmath122 is measured with good accuracy .",
    "the average result of belle and babar is @xcite : @xmath123 theoretical formula for @xmath122 comes from the consideration of the unitarity triangle : @xmath124    the @xmath125 expression which we minimize looks like : @xmath126 where theoretical expressions depend on the wolfenstein parameters @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 . expression ( [ chisq ] ) was minimized varying @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 .    performing the fit we use the value of @xmath131 from eq.([111 ] ) .",
    "the main uncertainty in @xmath132 originates from that in @xmath108 and it dominates in @xmath133 .",
    "that is why we use @xmath134 .",
    "here are our results : @xmath135 @xmath136 @xmath137 @xmath138 @xmath139    in fig.1 you can see a set of bounds on the parameters @xmath140 and @xmath141 of the ckm matrix .",
    "they comprise three circles , two branches of a hyperbola , and two straight lines .",
    "three circles originate from the @xmath68 measurement ( the green one ) , the measurement of @xmath73 ( the red one ) and from the lower bound on @xmath142 ( the yellow one ) .",
    "the hyperbola originates from the measurement of cp violation in the mixing of @xmath143-mesons .",
