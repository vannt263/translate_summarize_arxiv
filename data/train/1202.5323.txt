    "the maps were observed using beam - switching with a chop throw of 150  arcsec perpendicular to the major axis of cen  a. each jiggle - map covers a @xmath26 area on the sky , and our final map covers an area of @xmath27 , to observe the dust lane out to @xmath28 , which is half the distance from the centre of the galaxy to where the optical magnitude falls to 25 .",
    "the backend receiver , the auto - correlation spectrometer imaging system ( acsis ) , was set to a bandwidth of 1  ghz with 2048 channels , giving us a resolution of 488 khz or 0.43  km  s@xmath23 .",
    "the data were reduced using the starlink software package @xcite , maintained by the joint astronomy centre .",
    "we first flagged the data for any bad pixels in the raw data , and then built a cube ( two spatial dimensions and one in frequency ) with 7.5  arcsec pixels combining all of our observations .",
    "next , we masked out detections of the @xmath15co  @xmath25 line in our cube using an automated fitting routine , then fit a third order polynomial to the baseline in order to remove it from the cube .",
    "we then binned this cube to a resolution of 20  km  s@xmath23 to measure the average rms in the line free regions , which we determined to be @xmath29  mk .",
    "the first three moment maps ( integrated intensity , integrated velocity and velocity dispersion ) were created using the routine ` findclump ' ( part of starlink ) , which looks for detections of greater than @xmath30 .",
    "we first convolve the unbinned cube with a gaussian beam to match the 36arcsec resolution of the _ herschel _ spire 500  @xmath0 m map .",
    "next , we determine the average rms within the line free regions of the spectrum and expand the two - dimensional noise map into a cube . then we create a signal - to - noise cube by dividing the convolved cube by the noise cube and apply ` findclump ' to it .",
    "this method allows us to make detections of low - level emission better than just applying ` findclump ' to our image cube .",
    "the routine creates a mask of the detections in a smoothed version of the cube and then multiplies this mask by the signal - to - noise cube to obtain a cube containing only detections above several different @xmath31 cutoffs .",
    "then this cube is collapsed along the velocity axis to create the three moment maps in terms of the signal - to - noise .",
    "finally , the integrated intensity - to - noise map is multiplied by the two - dimensional noise map to obtain the true integrated intensity map . for a more detailed description of our reduction method see @xcite .    to evaluate the uncertainty in the integrated intensity map , we make use of the following equation : @xmath32 \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{line}}}{n_{\\mathrm{base}}}},\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the width of each channel in km  s@xmath23",

    "this map has a resolution of 19arcsec and units of @xmath36  @xmath37 , with a pixel scale of 4arcsec .",
    "we smoothed the image to a resolution of 36arcsec using a gaussian beam to match the resolution of the spire 500  @xmath0 m image , and regridded the image to match the 12arcsec pixel size .",
    "we also have a map of the radio continuum at 1.425ghz , originally published as part of the _ iras _ bright galaxy atlas @xcite , and retrieved from the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "this map allows us to trace the jets extending out from the central agn .",
    "we convolved this radio image with a gaussian beam and then regridded it to match the spire 500  @xmath0 m image .",
    "to determine the dust temperatures within the disk of cen  a , we fit the far - infrared and submm part of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ; 70 ",
    "500  @xmath0 m ) with a simple modified blackbody with @xmath38 , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a scaling constant to match the model to our observed fluxes .",
    "the parameter @xmath41 originates from the dust emissivity function , @xmath42 .    to constrain our modified blackbody",
    "fits , we created uncertainty maps for each wavelength that are a combination of the measurement uncertainty in the flux value of each pixel , the background noise in each pixel , and the calibration uncertainties for both pacs and spire ( see section  [ subsec : noise ] for details ) , added in quadrature .",
    "the value in each pixel of the resulting map is taken to be the total uncertainty for the equivalent pixel at a given wavelength .",
    "for each pixel in the images that has a s / n  @xmath43 at all five _ herschel _ wavelengths , we fit equation  [ eqn : blackbody ] to our flux measurements to determine the best - fitting temperature @xmath44 and constant @xmath40 for that pixel .",
    "an example of a sed fit for a typical pixel is shown in figure  [ fig : sed ] , and the pixel location is shown with a cross in figure  [ fig : temp ] .",
    "we also show the global sed that was obtained by summing the flux at each wavelength within all of the pixels with good fits in figure  [ fig : sed ] , and fitting the resulting totals .",
    "note that we tested the effect of removing the 70  @xmath0 m data point from our sed fit to ensure it was not forcing the curve to peak at shorter wavelengths , and that it was not from a separate thermal component of the dust .",
    "we found that the 70  @xmath0 m flux falls on the best - fit curves within uncertainties for these tests and thus we use all five wavelengths in our fitting routine .",
    "we then create a map of the dust temperature where pixels with poor chi - squared fits at the 95  percent confidence level have been masked out . in general the pixels with poor fits",
    "coincide with those where non - thermal radiation is making a significant contribution to the flux at 500  @xmath0 m .",
    "the temperature map is presented in figure  [ fig : temp ] , with 500  @xmath0 m contours overlaid to point out the location of the non - thermal emission .",
    "the temperature is about 30  k near the central agn region , and then smoothly falls off to about 20  k in the outer disk , and the average temperature throughout the entire region is approximately ( @xmath45 )  k.             we have also tried allowing both @xmath41 and temperature to vary in equation  [ eqn : blackbody ] , to investigate if the model fits to our data improve . while there is some small variation in @xmath41 throughout the disk , these deviations are small and the average value of @xmath41 is @xmath46",
    ". furthermore , there are no obvious trends in the variation of @xmath41 with radius .",
    "thus , the results of our test are consistent with our one parameter fit , giving us confidence in our fixed @xmath41 fits .",
    "we evaluated the uncertainty on the dust temperature by implementing a monte carlo algorithm on our modified blackbody fitting routine .",
    "for each wavelength , an artificial flux value lying within the uncertainty bounds of our observed measured flux value is generated randomly using a gaussian number generator .",
    "then we run the modified blackbody fitting routine on the simulated dataset and extract the temperature and constant for the best fitting function corresponding to that dataset .",
    "this process of creating artificial data and then fitting a function to them to determine the temperature is repeated 800 times for each pixel .",
    "we take the standard deviation of the temperature distribution for each pixel to be the uncertainty in the temperature .",
    "this uncertainty varies throughout the map , with an average of about 1  percent per pixel .",
    "the highest uncertainties are @xmath47  percent around the very edge of our map , where the signal to noise is lower for the flux maps , and we note that these uncertainties exclude the uncertainties arising from our assumed value for @xmath41 and thus emissivity .",

    "our observations show faint emission at 500  @xmath0 m extending beyond the 120  arcsec chop throw the authors used , and oversubtracting the background will lead to a lower dust mass estimate . studied the submm continuum using laboca 870  @xmath0 m data and combining these data with fluxes spanning 25870  @xmath0 m they found a higher mass of @xmath77  m@xmath5 .",
    "they subtract the flux contribution of the unresolved core from the total flux prior to estimating the dust , but do caution that they may not have removed all of the non - thermal emission arising from the radio jet .",
    "the gas mass we have obtained from our h@xmath20 map alone is @xmath71  m@xmath5 , including the central region which we masked out for our dust fitting .",
    "@xcite determined a molecular gas mass of @xmath78  m@xmath5 , after we adjust their result for our assumed x@xmath8 factor and distance .",
    "in addition , @xcite suggests the total molecular gas mass is @xmath79  m@xmath5 based on observations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our molecular gas mass is thus higher than those values previously published ; this is likely due to the improved sensitivity of our observations .",
    "the molecular gas mass is about twice the atomic mass of @xmath80  m@xmath5 .",
    "the high gas - to - dust mass ratio towards the central agn is a most interesting result .",
    "several studies of spiral galaxies have found that the gas - to - dust ratio is not constant throughout the disk , but rather decreases with decreasing distance from the centre of the galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in contrast to what we have found here .",
    "we have made a rough estimate of the co  @xmath1/co  @xmath14 ratio throughout the central disk using the co  @xmath14 map of @xcite to check if our assumption of 0.3 for this ratio is valid in the centremost regions of the disk .",
    "our calculations show an average value of 0.35 , and more importantly , they show no significant variation with radius .",
    "furthermore , looking at figure  [ fig : g2d ] we see that there is a smooth transition of the gas - to - dust mass ratio between the h@xmath20-dominated region to the hi - dominated region in the outer disk , which also suggests co excitation is not the primary cause of the high gas - to - dust ratio .",
    "the x@xmath8 factor is one variable that might affect the gas - to - dust ratio if it is not constant throughout the disk .",
    "we have assumed the galactic value for our calculations ; however , studies have shown that this conversion factor can vary with metallicity .",
    "if the metallicity decreases as a function of radius within cen  a , we would require a larger conversion factor at larger radii , which in turn would increase the gas - to - dust ratio farther out in the disk , potentially bringing it up to a similar value as that in the centre .",
    "alternatively , the x@xmath8 factor can be smaller by up to a factor of @xmath81 for starbursting galaxies @xcite .",
    "this effect could reduce the gas - to - dust ratio in regions of strong star forming activity ; however , the total far - infrared luminosity for cen  a is @xmath82 , while the x@xmath8 conversion factor is typically affected at luminosities greater than @xmath83 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "one possibility is that dust is being destroyed by the jets extending out in either direction from the agn .",
    "it is plausible that some of the dust grains are being destroyed by the agn either through dust sputtering or through shocks .",
    "the total x - ray luminosity of the agn of cen  a is @xmath84  erg  s@xmath23 @xcite , which is comparable in x - ray luminosity to the agn found in m87",
    ". it might be possible for these photons to deplete the dust in the surrounding ism . in support of this scenario ,",
    "did not detect thermal dust emission in m87 , which also contains a jet .",
    "it is also possible that the dust is entrained in the jets of cen  a. found a dusty halo surrounding the starbursting galaxy m82 using _ herschel _ observations .",
    "they considered entrainment by a galactic wind as a possible explanation even though they finally concluded that the origin was likely due to tidal interactions .",
    "we can not rule out entrainment by galactic winds as a possibility for cen  a. unfortunately , we can not probe close enough to the jets to further investigate this assumption due to our limited resolution and the non - thermal emission component .",
    "alternatively , a larger gas reservoir in the centre could also increase the gas - to - dust ratio .",
    "this would require dust - poor gas falling onto the disk and being funneled toward the centre . however , if this was the case , we would likely have found a high gas - to - dust throughout the disk and not concentrated toward the innermost part of the disk .",
    "it also does not seem plausible for the gas to be migrating through the disk faster than the dust .",
    "interestingly , there is a large ring of material that is seen in the mid- and far - infrared close to the regions in which we see a high gas - to - dust ratio .",
    "first noticed the ` s ' shaped structure with isocam observations at 7 and 15  @xmath0 m , and postulated that this structure was a bar at the centre of the galaxy .",
    "later , observations @xcite supported a tilted ring scenario to explain the structure observed .",
    "our _ herschel _ observations at 70  @xmath0 m also show emission from this ring ( figure  [ fig : herschel_maps ] ) , and in fact , the high gas - to - dust ratio appears to correspond with the 70  @xmath0 m contours of the ring , as shown in figure  [ fig : g2d ] .",
    "the models by @xcite suggest that there is a deficit in the dust distribution at radii less than about 50  arcsec ( @xmath85  pc ) .",
    "this is at a similar radius to our observed high gas - to - dust ratio . a dust deficit throughout @xmath86  arcsec might seem less likely to be related to the agn and is perhaps better related to star formation activity .",
    "observations probing closer to the nucleus are necessary to determine if the gas - to - dust ratio remains high or increases further as we approach the agn .",
    "we have presented new observations of the dust continuum from the pacs and spire instruments on board the _ herchel space observatory _ at 70 , 160 , 250 , 350 and 500  @xmath0 m .",
    "in addition , we present new data tracing the co  @xmath1 transition taken with the harp - b instrument mounted on the jcmt .",
    "we have used these data to probe the interstellar medium within the disk of centaurus  a on a pixel - by - pixel basis .",
    "we observe the ring of emission at 70  @xmath0 m previously reported at infrared and submm wavelengths , while our 500  @xmath0 m ( and to some extent the 350  @xmath0 m ) images show detections of the non - thermal continuum emission previously reported at 870  @xmath0 m by .",
    "we model the dust spectral energy distribution using a single component modified blackbody , and find temperatures of @xmath87  k in the centre that decrease with radius . using the temperature map , we find the total dust mass to be @xmath4  m@xmath5 .",
    "the total gas mass is @xmath6  m@xmath5 , and combining the dust and gas masses we have produced a gas - to - dust ratio map .",
    "the average gas - to - dust ratio is approximately @xmath7 , similar to that of the milky way , with an interesting peak to about 275 towards the centre of the galaxy . after exploring several possible scenarios to explain the high gas - to - dust mass ratio ,",
    "the most appealing one is that of a correspondance between the high gas - to - dust mass ratio and the ring about 1  kpc in size , which is best fit by a warped tilted ring model by @xcite that consists of a deficit of dusty material inwards of the ring .",
    "the deficit of dust may be due to x - ray emission from the central agn destroying the dust grains or the jets are removing dust from the centre of the galaxy .",
