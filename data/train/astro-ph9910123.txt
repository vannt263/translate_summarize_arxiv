    "the infrared emission features ( iefs ) at 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.3 and 12.7 , and their associated continuum , have been the subject of intense study over the last decade .",
    "the ief strengths correlate with the c / o ratio in planetary nebulae , suggesting a carbon - based carrier ( roche & aitken 1986 ; cohen et al .",
    "1986 , 1989 ) .",
    "duley & williams ( 1981 ) were the first to comment that some ief wavelengths are characteristic of the bending and stretching modes of various c  h and c ",
    "c bonds in aromatic hydrocarbons .",
    "there has since been a steady accumulation of evidence , both laboratory and observational , in support of this assertion .",
    "the specific nature of the carrier(s ) , however , is yet to be determined .",
    "the iefs have been attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules ( lger & puget 1984 ; allamandola , tielens , & barker 1985 ) and to more amorphous materials containing aromatic hydrocarbons ( sakata et al .",

    "( 1989 ) attribute the broad spectral structures at 6  9  and 11  13 , which accompany the iefs , to pah clusters and amorphous carbon grains .",
    "the origin of the 1  25 @xmath0 m continuum emission , like that of the associated ief emission , is still the subject of debate .",
    "the continuum is observed in regions of very low radiation density , such as reflection nebulae and infrared cirrus , where the grain equilibrium temperature is too low to explain the emission as being thermal in nature ( sellgren 1984 ; draine & anderson 1985 ; guillois et al .",
    "it has been attributed to single ultraviolet ( uv ) photon excitation of very small grains ( sellgren , werner , & dinerstein 1983 ; sellgren 1984 ) , to pah molecular fluorescence ( lger & puget 1984 ; allamandola et al .",
    "1985 , 1989 ; puget & lger 1989 ) , and to hydrogenated amorphous carbon grain luminescence ( duley & williams 1988 ; duley 1988 ) .",
    "the ief carriers are a ubiquitous component of the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "past studies have found iefs in _ emission _ near galactic regions , reflection nebulae , planetary nebulae , proto - planetary nebulae , and the diffuse ism of our own and other galaxies ( see reviews by aitken 1981 ; allamandola et al .",

    "the 3.3 @xmath0 m ief may have also been detected in _ absorption _ in molecular clouds ( sellgren , smith , & brooke 1994 ; sellgren et al . 1995 ; brooke , sellgren , & smith 1996 ; brooke , sellgren & geballe 1999 ) .",
    "ief spectra have been recently classified into several groups ( geballe 1997 ; tokunaga 1997 ) .",
    "class a spectra at 5  15 @xmath0 m display narrow iefs at 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.3 and 12.7 , as well as associated continuum emission .",
    "the 7.7  ief is invariably the strongest of the class a narrow iefs ( geballe 1997 ) .",
    "by contrast , class b spectra lack the 8.6  ief and have notably broader features at 8 and 11.5  ( kwok , volk , & hrivnak 1989 ) .",
    "class b spectra sometimes also show a strong broad emission feature at 8.8  ( buss et al . 1993 ) . the overwhelming majority of ief spectra currently measured fall under the category of class a. sources with class a iefs are typically uv - rich sources , such as the diffuse ism , reflection nebulae , regions , young stars , planetary nebulae and galaxies hosting star formation .",
    "by contrast , the half - dozen or so class b spectra found to date arise from f and g - type post - agb stars forming planetary nebulae ( i.e. proto - planetary nebulae ; geballe et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "well - developed theoretical work exists for the absorption and emission properties of pahs , inspired by the hypothesis that pahs are responsible for the iefs",
    ". mixtures of pahs and other dust components have been used to model the uv and visible extinction curve and the infrared emission observed in the ism ( puget , lger , & boulanger 1985 ; chlewicki & laureijs 1988 ; dsert , boulanger & puget 1990 ; joblin , lger , & martin 1992 ; siebenmorgen & krgel 1992 ; schutte , tielens , & allamandola 1993 ; dwek et al .",
    "1997 ; li & greenberg 1997 ; silva et al .",
    "all of these models include a size distribution of pahs .",
    "most of these size distributions include large pahs , expected in the ism but not yet measured in the laboratory , by extrapolation from laboratory data on smaller pahs .",
    "interstellar pahs are predicted to be mainly positively charged and neutral in strong uv fields , and mainly neutral and negatively charged when the uv field is weak ( bakes & tielens 1994 , 1998 ; salama et al .",
    "1996 ; dartois and dhendecourt 1997 ) . some interstellar models ( particularly dsert et al . 1990 ) include both neutral and ionized pahs .",
    "these models for the absorption and emission from a size distribution of neutral and ionized pahs predict that the fraction of the total interstellar extinction curve due to pah absorption is much larger at uv wavelengths than at visible wavelengths .",
    "this is vividly illustrated in figures 2 and 3 of dsert et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , figures 1 , 2 , and 3 of joblin et al .",

    "( 1997 ) , and figure 3 of silva et al .",
    "if pahs contribute more to the total interstellar extinction at uv than visible wavelengths , then pahs should absorb and re - emit a larger fraction of the total absorption and re - emission by dust in uv - rich sources than in uv - poor sources .",
    "reflection nebulae are valuable tools for the study of the class a interstellar iefs . the localized heating of an interstellar cloud by a nearby , optically visible , star allows us to study the iefs over varying excitation conditions by observing reflection nebulae illuminated by stars of different effective temperature , @xmath11 .",
    "this localized heating also results in brighter infrared emission than would be observed in a similar cloud heated only by the diffuse interstellar radiation field .",
    "sellgren , luan , & werner ( 1990 ) analyzed _ iras _ observations of reflection nebulae illuminated by stars with @xmath1 = 3,000 k ",
    "33,000 k. they observed that the ratio of nebular emission within the _ iras _ 12 @xmath0 m broadband filter , @xmath12(12 @xmath0 m ) , to the total bolometric far - infrared nebular emission , @xmath13(fir ) , was independent of @xmath1 , for @xmath11 = 5,000 k ",
    "33,000 k. the total infrared emission of a reflection nebula is due to starlight absorbed and re - radiated by the mixture of molecules and grains responsible for the total interstellar extinction curve .",
    "their observation that @xmath12(12 @xmath0m)/@xmath13(fir ) is constant over a wide range of @xmath11 implies that the material emitting in the _ iras _",
    "12 @xmath0 m band has an absorption curve with a wavelength dependence similar to that of the total interstellar absorption curve over both uv and visible wavelengths .",
    "the sellgren et al .",
    "( 1990 ) observations , finding @xmath14(12 @xmath0m)/@xmath13(fir ) to be independent of @xmath11 , appear to be in conflict with theoretical predictions that the _ iras _ 12 @xmath0 m band is dominated by pah emission and that pahs contribute more to the total interstellar extinction curve at uv than visible wavelengths ( dsert et al . 1990 ; joblin et al .",

    "we obtained isocam multi - wavelength images of vdb101 , vdb111 , vdb133 and vdb135 between 1996 march19 and 1998 february 16 .",
    "we used a set of 9  10 cvf wavelengths and 1  2 narrowband filters toward each nebula , in four sequences .",
    "each sequence contains observations at three to four wavelengths , as listed in table [ tab : obswave ] .",
    "we observed all four sequences for each nebula , except for vdb135 , where no sequence 3 observations were made .",
    "while the filter observations within a given sequence were performed consecutively in time , the scheduling of the sequences themselves were not necessarily constrained so .",
    "some sequences thus share common wavelength observations to provide a check for consistency with time .",
    "all observations were made with a 6  pixel@xmath15 scale giving a total field of view of 32 with the 32@xmath932 pixel array .",
    "the cvf spectral resolution was @xmath16 = @xmath17 = 40 and the narrowband filters at 4.5  ( lw1 ) and 15  ( lw9 ) had bandpasses of @xmath18 = 1  and 2 , respectively ( isocam team 1994 ) .",
    "the observations were position - switched ( in a 2-cycle sky@xmath19source@xmath19sky@xmath19source sequence ) , with equal times on the source and sky to allow for the removal of the background and dark current contributions .",
    "the source observations were centered on the illuminating star(s ) of each nebula and the sky positions were toward nearby regions deemed free , based on inspection of the _ iras _ 12  skyview images , of any significant emission above the zodiacal component and the local cirrus background .",

    "the spectral resolution was @xmath16 = 40 .",
    "the observations were spaced in wavelength to provide a factor of 1  2 oversampling in the vdb17 and vdb59 spectra , and 2  4 oversampling in those of the other sources .",
    "the basic exposure time used was 2.1s , with 8 exposures per cvf step ( totalling 17.6s ) toward the bright sources vdb17 and vdb59 , and 11 exposures per cvf step ( totalling 23.1s ) toward vdb101 , vdb133 and vdb135 .",

    "the `` source '' fields were offset from the central star so as not to contain the star , thus allowing us to use longer integration times without saturating the detector .",
    "the vdb133 field was centered toward the peak ief emission in the region , as inferred from the earlier position - switched _ iso _ observations , and those of vdb17 and vdb59 were centered in the directions containing the strongest extended infrared emission in our unpublished near - infrared ground - based images of the regions .",

    "the images were reduced , from the basic ( cisp ) data product , in the idl - based isocam data reduction environment known as `` ice '' , developed at the institut dastrophysique spatiale ( ias ) . by utilizing the basic ice modules we were able to more closely monitor and interact with the various stages of processing (",
    "i.e. , the deglitching of cosmic ray hits from the data , detector transient response rectification and flat - fielding ) than with the standard ( more automated ) cam ia processing package .",
    "indeed , special efforts were made in the restoration of the source fluxes ; the description of the method follows .",
    "the isocam detector array experiences a response lag and a flux - dependent transient response ( or residual memory effect ) . in order to recover the actual source fluxes , @xmath21 ,",
    "models of the detector behavior have been developed by several of the institutes involved with isocam .",
    "we have adopted the transient model developed at the ias ( abergel et al .",
    "1996 ) ,    @xmath22    which has proven from past experience to work best in rectifying low - level flux like that expected of the diffuse nebular emission . the measured flux , @xmath23 , at time , @xmath24 , is the sum of the instantaneous response of the detector , @xmath25 , and the integrated contribution of the exponentially decaying flux history of the detector ( abergel et al 1996 ) .",
    "the detector is characterized by two parameters , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , the exact behavior of which is not well - known but which likely varies somewhat from pixel to pixel and perhaps with time , over the long term ( weeks to months ) .",
    "the time constant for the exponential decay , @xmath28 , is a function both of the measured flux and of the detector parameter , @xmath27 . in the best of circumstances , the flux history of the detector prior to the start of one s own observations",
    "is known and can then be used to rectify the first part of the flux time series .",
    "since , however , the data prior to one s own are generally not available , a number of `` padding '' frames , all with an estimated constant flux value , are instead prepended .",
    "if the detector response were perfect ( figure [ ts]_a _ ) , the flux history of a 2-cycle chop ( sky@xmath19source@xmath19sky@xmath19source ) sequence , for a single pixel or an average of pixels in the array , should appear as a series of square functions with the data points falling on two plateaus at a common minimum and two plateaus at a common maximum ; the entire pattern then repeats itself ( but likely with some general flux offset with respect to the first ) for each of the subsequent position - switched cycles taken with a different filter . figure [ ts]_b _ displays an observed flux time sequence in raw form .",
    "the effects of the detector s finite response time and flux memory are seen to cause significant deviations from the ideal square pattern .",
    "the individual source and sky segments of the flux sequence , which should otherwise have constant levels , are either temporally increasing or decreasing ( depending on the history of the detected signal ) because of the non - ideal detector behavior .",
    "the position - switched data lend themselves well to the determination of the detector parameters . by using the ideal square - wave pattern as the target in a chi - square minimization procedure , with @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and",
    "the `` padding '' constant as free parameters , the best values of these parameters that rectify the observed time sequences can be found .",
    "indeed , a set of parameters was determined for each of the four observation sequences toward vdb133 from averages of those pixels containing the nebular emission .",
    "the four parameter sets ranged between @xmath26 = 0.72  0.73 and @xmath27  = 954  1603 adu gain@xmath15 , with padding values of 9.2  13.8 adu gain@xmath15 , where adu gain@xmath15 are analog - to - digital units divided by the detector gain .",
    "the specific parameter sets were used to rectify the four corresponding vdb133 observation sequences , and their average ( @xmath26 = 0.72 and @xmath27  = 1200 adu gain@xmath15 ) was used to rectify the data sequences of the other sources .",
    "the parameter values determined by us provided some improvement over the results based on the values adopted by abergel et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , @xmath26 = 0.63 and @xmath27  = 1200 adu gain@xmath15 , for observations toward @xmath29 oph .",
    "figure [ ts]_c _ displays a rectified flux time sequence , after the observed flux time sequence ( fig .",
    "[ ts]_b _ ) has been rectified using the appropriate parameter values .",
    "in contrast , it is not possible to deduce the detector parameters from the full cvf scans with the method described above , since these scans involve sequential wavelength observations toward a given position and thus do not possess a predictable pattern , much less the regular `` square wave '' pattern of the position - switched sequences .",
    "all full cvf scan sequences of our supplemental observations were thus rectified using the average of the parameters determined from the original vdb133 position - switched sequences : @xmath26 = 0.72 and @xmath27  = 1200 adu gain@xmath15 .",
    "the source and sky images were rectified separately before being used to produce the final source@xmath30sky maps . in each case , the dark current image ( boulanger 1996 ) was subtracted from the maps to establish the absolute count levels required for the rectification procedure .",
    "it was discovered , however , that the odd - even noise pattern ( isocam team 1994 ) remained in the images after a simple subtraction of the dark and that multiplication of the dark field ( with factors ranging over 1.03  1.13 ) was needed to eliminate this problem .",
    "a single dark multiplication factor was used for all observations of a given source .",
    "an uncertainty of @xmath200.03 adu gain@xmath15 in determining the dark factor value translates to an uncertainty of @xmath203 mjy sr@xmath15 in the individual source and sky map levels .",
    "however , since the source image and the sky image of a given nebula each use the same dark field ( with the same dark multiplicative factor ) , any errors in absolute flux levels of the component fields do not propagate into the source@xmath30sky maps .",
    "the level offset in the source and sky images may lead to differential errors by the rectification process that appear in the source@xmath30sky maps , however , on the order of 5% of the absolute sky level (  4 ) .",
    "figures [ iso1 ] , [ iso2 ] , and [ iso3 ] show our rectified , sky - subtracted spectra of reflection nebulae from position - switched observations and cvf scan observations .",
    "each reflection nebula spectrum is a spatial _ average _ over a subsection of the image containing the localized ief emission .",
    "the specifics of the spatial subregions used to produce the spectra are given in table [ tab : intreg ] .",
    "for the position - switched data , where the image contained the illuminating star , the star and the immediately adjacent region containing a spurious arc - like reflection feature from the star ( typically pixels x , y = [ 620 , 1124 ] of the array ) were excluded from the spatial integration .    the position - switched observations were the first performed in this study .",
    "the 11 unique wavelength measurements were chosen to measure the strengths of the anticipated class a interstellar iefs ( 6.2 , 7.6 , 8.62 , 11.22 @xmath31 ) , their surrounding continua ( 4.5 , 5.8 , 9.5 , 10.5 , and 15.0 @xmath31 ) and broad spectral structures such as the 6  9 @xmath31 bump and the 11  13 @xmath31 plateau ( 7.0 , 8.4 , and 12.0 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "the cvf scan observations , which provide a complete cvf spectrum over 5.14  15.1 @xmath0 m , were performed second . in nearly all the cvf scans , there is a strong curvature at the start of the upward and downward scans because of the detector s flux memory and the satellite having slewed across the bright central star . with such large flux deviations , especially with the case of vdb17 and vdb59 ,",
    "the response at the start of each scan could not entirely be corrected by the aforementioned rectification procedures (  3.1 ) . to avoid these transient artifacts , we discarded data shortward of 8.0 @xmath0 m for the upward scan and data longward of 12.0 @xmath0 m for the downward scan .",
    "our final sky - subtracted spectra are thus constructed from the downward scan at 5.1  8.0 @xmath0 m , from an average of the upward and downward scans at 8.0  12.0 @xmath0 m , and from the upward scan at 12.0  15.1 @xmath0 m .",
    "the difference between the up and down scans is plotted over a slightly wider range of wavelengths for each cvf - scanned spectrum , to estimate the uncertainty in our cvf scan spectra .",
    "the 9  10 @xmath0 m segment of the cvf scan spectra also contain a prominent artifact resulting from the steeply declining transmission functions of the two cvf filter wheels near their wavelength overlap region : the long wavelength extreme of the cvf1 wheel ( 5.14  9.44 ) and the short wavelength extreme of the cvf2 wheel ( 9.33  16.52 ) . thus the 9  10 @xmath0 m spectral region , while shown in some spectra , has been excluded from detailed analysis .",
    "the position - switched spectrum of vdb133 ( fig [ iso1]_a _ ) displays the distinct signature of class a interstellar iefs at 6.2 , 7.6 , 8.62 , and 11.22 @xmath0 m . the overwhelming majority of ief spectra observed fall within this class ( geballe 1997 ; tokunaga 1997 ) . the full cvf - scan spectrum ( fig .",

    "both these nebulae are illuminated by hot , uv - rich stars ( @xmath1 = 12,000 k and 19,000 k for vdb17 and vdb59 , respectively ) and are typical of those that display strong interstellar iefs .",

    "the task of detecting iefs toward vdb101 , vdb111 , and vdb135 , even with isocam operating under optimal conditions , was understood to be a difficult one .",
    "the predicted sensitivity of isocam ( @xmath200.19 mjy sr@xmath15 with 200s integration time per filter in the position - switched observations ) should have been sufficient , in principle . in practice ,",
    "our actual isocam sensitivity limit was @xmath201 mjy sr@xmath15 for our observations , due to the faintness of the three nebulae compared to the relatively high background emission from diffuse galactic emission along the same line of sight .",
    "the larger than anticipated uncertainty is attributed primarily to the limitations of the rectification procedure to completely correct for the detector effects and the uncertainties in the dark - current subtraction procedure required for the rectification process ( discussed in  3 ) . to achieve",
    "the expected sensitivity of 0.19 mjy sr@xmath15 on top of a typical background level of 20 mjy sr@xmath15 would require that our flux rectification procedure be accurate to @xmath201% .",

    "another measure of the uv field is the ratio of the stellar flux emitted at uv wavelengths to the total stellar flux .",
    "this simplifies the treatment of the uv field in vdb 133 , since this ratio equals the sum of the uv fluxes of the two stars divided by the sum of the total flux of the two stars .",

    "we have explored two ranges of uv wavelengths , both inspired by previous theoretical , observational , and laboratory work on pahs and the iefs .",
    "the low ratio of visible to uv absorption , for the distribution of pah sizes included in published models of interstellar absorption and emission , occurs because large molecules in general do not have electronic transitions beyond a cutoff wavelength , @xmath32 , proportional to the molecule s length ( platt 1956 ) .",
    "values of @xmath33 = 300  500 nm have been estimated for neutral pahs containing roughly 40 carbon atoms ( crawford , tielens , & allamandola 1985 ; allamandola et al .",
