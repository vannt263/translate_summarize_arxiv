    "there has been long - standing interest in the phase behavior of many - particle systems in @xmath0-dimensional euclidean spaces @xmath1 in which the particles interact with soft , bounded pair potentials @xcite .",
    "considerable attention has been devoted to the determination of the classical ground states ( global energy minima ) of such interactions @xcite .",
    "while typical interactions lead to unique classical ground states , certain special pair potentials are characterized by degenerate classical ground states  a phenomenon that has attracted recent attention @xcite .",
    "one family of such pair interactions are the `` stealthy potentials '' because their ground states correspond to configurations that completely suppress single scattering for a range of wave numbers .",
    "the fourier transforms of these potentials are bounded and non - negative and have compact support @xcite , and hence they have corresponding direct - space potentials that are bounded and long ranged . because of their special construction in fourier space , finding the ground states of stealthy potentials is equivalent to constraining the structure factor to be zero for wave vectors @xmath2 contained within the support of the fourier transformed potential @xcite , as will be summarized in sec .  [ detail ] .",
    "in the case when the constrained wave vectors lie in the radial interval @xmath3 , the stealthy ground states fall within the class of hyperuniform states of matter @xcite and can be tuned to have varying degrees of disorder .",
    "disordered hyperuniform systems in general are of current interest because they are characterized by an anomalously large suppression of long - wavelength density fluctuations and can exist as equilibrium or nonequilibrium states , either classically or quantum mechanically @xcite .",
    "moreover , because disordered hyperuniform states of matter have characteristics that lie between a crystal and a liquid @xcite , they are endowed with novel physical properties @xcite .",
    "when a dimensionless parameter @xmath4 , inversely proportional to the number density @xmath5 and proportional to @xmath6 ( size of the constrained region ) is sufficiently small , the hyperuniform ground states are infinitely degenerate and counterintuitively disordered ( i.e. , isotropic without any bragg peaks ) @xcite .",
    "however , when @xmath4 is large enough ( @xmath5 is sufficiently small ) , there is a phase transition to a regime in which the ground states are crystalline or highly ordered @xcite . for each spatial dimension @xmath0",
    ", there is a special value of @xmath4 , @xmath7 , at which the ground state is unique @xcite .",
    "the unique ground state is the dual ( reciprocal lattice ) of the densest bravais lattice packing in each dimension @xcite . in two and higher dimensions ,",
    "as soon as @xmath4 drops below @xmath7 , the set of the ground states become uncountably infinite and gradually includes progressively less ordered structures @xcite .",
    "similarly to stealthy potentials , a family of two- , three- , and four - body potentials that lead to disordered ground states has also been defined in fourier space and studied @xcite .    due to the complexity of the problem , almost all previous investigations of the ground states employed computer simulations .",
    "such numerical studies were carried out in one , two and three dimensions @xcite .",
    "the ground states were sampled by minimization of potential energy at fixed densities starting from random initial conditions in a @xmath0-dimensional cubic simulation box under periodic boundary conditions .",
    "a few optimization techniques were employed to find the global energy minima with very high precision @xcite .",
    "generally , a numerically obtained ground - state configuration depends on the number of particles @xmath8 within the fundamental cell , initial particle configuration , shape of the fundamental cell , and particular optimization technique used @xcite .",
    "adding to the complexity of the problem is that the disordered ground states are highly degenerate with a configurational dimensionality that depends on the density , and there are an infinite number of distinct ways to sample this complex ground - state manifold , each with its own probability measure .",
    "these nontrivial aspects had made the task of formulating a statistical - mechanical theory of stealthy degenerate ground states a daunting one .",
    "recently , we have formulated such an ensemble theory that yields analytical predictions of the structural characteristics and other properties of stealthy degenerate ground states @xcite .",
    "a number of exact results for the thermodynamic and structural properties of these ground states were derived that applied to _ general _ ensembles .",
    "we then specialized our results to the canonical ensemble ( in the zero - temperature limit ) by exploiting an ansatz that stealthy disordered ground states ( for sufficiently small @xmath4 ) behave remarkably like  pseudo \" disordered equilibrium hard - sphere systems in fourier space .",
    "our theoretical predictions for the pair correlation function @xmath9 and structure factor @xmath10 of these entropically favored disordered ground states were shown to be in agreement with corresponding computer simulations across the first three space dimensions .",
    "we also made predictions for the corresponding excited states for sufficiently small temperatures that were in agreement with simulations .    because the focus of that previous investigation was the development of ensemble theories , few simulation details were presented about how the canonical ensemble was sampled to produce stealthy disordered ground states .",
    "one aim of the present paper is to provide a comprehensive description of the numerical procedure that we used to produce the simulation results in ref .  .",
    "moreover , here we also extend those results by applying the simulation procedure to study numerically the ground states in the canonical ensemble for all allowable values of @xmath4 and thus investigate the entire phase diagram for the entropically favored states across the first three space dimensions . in the second paper of this series , we will study the exotic aperiodic `` wavy phases '' identified in previous numerical work @xcite ( or `` stacked - slider phases , '' as called in the sequel to this paper @xcite ) , a special part of the ground - state manifold .",
    "an analytical model will enable an even more detailed study of this phase .    as a justification of sampling the canonical ensemble instead of minimizing energy",
    ", we also demonstrate here how a variety of different optimization techniques affect the ground states that are sampled , which was not previously investigated @xcite .",
    "this investigation reveals that the pair statistics of the ground - state configurations indeed generally depend on the algorithm .",
    "moreover , we show here that the energy minimization results depend on the initial conditions as well .",
    "we also provide the reason why the simulations in ref .   and this paper employ noncubic , possibly deforming , simulation boxes for @xmath11 .",
    "because almost all previous numerical simulations were performed using some specific form of stealthy potentials , we show here that different forms of stealthy potentials produce identical pair correlation functions , suggesting that the specific choice of the potential form does not affect the ensemble being sampled .    among our major findings , we show that energy minimizations starting from random initial conditions may lead to clustering of particles , the degree of which depends on the algorithm for a finite range of @xmath4 below 1/2 across the first three space dimensions . when minimizing the energy starting from configurations equilibrated at some temperature @xmath12 , the ground - state configurations discovered depend on @xmath12 .",
    "however , the algorithm dependence diminishes in the @xmath13 limit .",
    "we also demonstrate that the pair statistics [ @xmath9 and @xmath10 ] in this limit do not depend on the particular form of the stealthy potential .",
    "the similarity between the structure factor in this limit and the pair correlation function of an equilibrium hard - sphere system in direct space @xcite is valid for @xmath4 up to some dimension - dependent values between 0.25 and 0.33 in the first three space dimensions .",
    "beyond this range of @xmath4 , the hard - sphere analogy in fourier space undergoes modification . as @xmath4 increases further ( to the value of about 0.4 in two dimensions , for example ) , the first peak in the structure factor diminishes while second peak in the structure factor grows and engulfs the first peak .",
    "our simulated pair statistics obey certain exact integral conditions in ref .   with very high accuracy , indicating the high fidelity of the numerical results .",
    "in the infinite - system - size limit , at @xmath15 , the entropically favored ground states undergo a transition from disordered states to crystalline states . depending on the dimension ,",
    "this phase transition can occur when aperiodic structures still are part of the ground state manifold , demonstrating that crystalline ( ordered ) structures can have a higher entropy than disordered structures .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ detail ] , we briefly summarize the numerical collective - coordinate procedure and other details of the simulation that we employ in the present paper with justifications . in sec .",
    "[ dependence ] , we study the dependence of the results on a variety of energy minimization algorithms , initial conditions , and the forms of the stealthy potentials . in sec .",
    "[ ensemble ] , we provide pair correlation function , structure factor , voronoi cell - volume distribution , and configuration snapshots of the stealthy hyperuniform ground states obtained from the canonical ensemble in the zero - temperature limit .",

    "ii of ref .  , we simulate point processes in periodic fundamental cells ( i.e. simulation boxes ) with a pairwise additive potential @xmath16 such that its fourier transform exists . under nearest image convention , the total potential energy can be calculated by summing over all pairs of particles : @xmath17 where @xmath8 is the number of particles , @xmath18 is the locations of the particles in @xmath0-dimensional euclidean space , and @xmath19 . instead of summing over all pairwise contributions in the real space , the potential energy can also be represented in fourier space : @xmath20 , \\label{pot_f}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the volume of the fundamental cell , @xmath22 is the fourier transform of the pair potential , @xmath23 is the complex collective density variable [ with @xmath24 , and both summations are over all reciprocal lattice vector @xmath25 s appropriate to the fundamental cell . for every @xmath26",
    ", @xmath27 is related to the structure factor , @xmath28 , via @xmath29 given a @xmath30 , the corresponding real - space pair potential is @xmath31 in a finite - sized system , the real - space pair potential has the same periodicity as the fundamental cell .",
    "therefore , in the infinite - volume limit , the cell periodicity disappears .",
    "a family of `` stealthy '' potentials , which completely suppress single scattering for all wave vectors within a specific cutoff in their ground states , are defined as @xcite : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a positive isotropic function and @xmath34 is a constant . in this paper",
    "we always take @xmath35 , which sets the length scale . we will also use @xmath36 unless otherwise specified . in the infinite - system - size limit ,",
    "the isotropic @xmath30 correspond to an isotropic real - space pair potential @xmath37 @xcite . however , for finite systems , the corresponding @xmath37 is anisotropic . in appendix",
    "[ finite ] , we compare the infinite - system - size limit @xmath37 with the finite - size @xmath37 s in different - shaped simulation boxes and select the simulation box shape to be used in this paper based on which @xmath37 is closest to the infinite - size - limit @xmath37 .    from eqs .  and",
    ", one can see that a configuration is a stealthy ground state if @xmath38 for all @xmath25 points such that @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , finding a ground state of a stealthy potential is equivalent to constraining @xmath38 for all of those @xmath25 points .",
    "however , in a simulation , one does not need to check all of the constraints . as detailed in ref .",
    ", if there are @xmath40 @xmath25 points within the constrained radius , only @xmath41 of them are independent and needed to be constrained to zero .",
    "equation   can be simplified as @xcite : @xmath42 where the sum is over all _ independent _ constraints , and @xmath43/(2v_f)\\ ] ] is a constant independent of the particle positions @xmath44 .",
    "we now introduce a parameter @xmath45 which determines the degree to which the ground states are constrained , and therefore the degeneracy and disorder of the ground states @xcite .",
    "note that the constraints depend on @xmath34 and the fundamental cell but are independent of the specific shape of @xmath46 as long as @xmath47 for all @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , changing @xmath46 does not change the set of the ground states . however , there is no proof that changing @xmath46 does not change the relative sampling weights of the ground states .    in this paper",
    "we study various systems with different @xmath4 s and @xmath8 s .",
    "one numerical complication is that these numbers can not be chosen arbitrarily , since @xmath49 must be an integer consistent with the specific shape of the simulation box .",
    "( for example , a list of the allowed @xmath41 values for a two - dimensional square box is given in table ii of ref .  .",
    ") this constraint is especially hard to meet when simulating multiple systems at the same @xmath4 value across dimensions .",
    "in fact , both @xmath4 and @xmath8 in table  [ np1 ] ( see appendix [ number ] ) had to be chosen carefully to meet this constraint .",
    "taking the gradient of eq .",
    "( [ pot_f2 ] ) yields the forces on particles : @xmath50 , \\label{force}\\ ] ] where the sum is also over all independent constraints .",
    "this equation enables us to perform both energy minimizations and molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations . in an energy minimization",
    ", a derivative - based algorithm is used . the first term on the right side of eq .",
    "is provided to the algorithm as the objective function and the negative of the force in eq .",
    "is provided as the derivative . in order to minimize energy ,",
    "we have tried different algorithms including the minop algorithm @xcite , the steepest descent algorithm allowing large steps @xcite , the low - storage bfgs ( l - bfgs ) algorithm @xcite , the polak - ribiere conjugate gradient algorithm @xcite , and our `` local gradient descent '' algorithm described in appendix  [ localgradientdescent ] .",
    "when @xmath51 , the objective function always ends up being very close to zero ( the minimum ) . the maximum ending objective function for different algorithms varies from as high as @xmath52 for a conjugate gradient algorithm to @xmath53 for the local gradient descent and steepest descent algorithms to @xmath54 for the l - bfgs algorithm , and to as low as @xmath55 for the minop algorithm . from our practical point of view ,",
    "all of these algorithms are precise enough , since an error of @xmath52 or lower is indiscernible from any results presented below .",
    "because the l - bfgs algorithm is the fastest , we will use it unless otherwise specified .",
    "the energy minimizations , if started from random initial configurations , will sample an algorithm - dependent , nonequilibrium ensemble . to sample the canonical ensemble at a given equilibrium temperature @xmath12 we use md simulations .",
    "one important parameter in md simulations is the integration time step .",
    "since the optimal choice of the time step depends on the temperature , and the latter varies across several orders of magnitude in this paper , we desire a systematic way to determine the optimal time step . starting from an energy minimized configuration and a very small time step ( 0.01 in dimensionless units )",
    ", we repeat the following steps @xmath56 times to equilibrate the system and find a suitable time step :    * assign a random velocity from boltzmann distribution at @xmath12 to each particle . *",
    "calculate the total ( kinetic and potential ) energy of the system @xmath57 . *",
    "evolve the system 1500 time steps using the velocity verlet algorithm @xcite .",
    "* calculate the total energy of the system @xmath58 . * if @xmath59 , then the time step is too large and errors will build up quickly .",
    "therefore , we decrease the time step by @xmath60 . on the other hand , if @xmath61 , there is still some room to increase the time step . since increasing the time step increases the efficiency of md simulations",
    ", we increase the time step by @xmath60 .",
    "after the system is equilibrated and the time step is chosen , we perform constant temperature md simulations with particle velocity resetting @xcite .",
    "a randomly chosen particle is assigned a random velocity , drawn from maxwell - boltzmann distribution , every 100 steps .",
    "we take a sample configuration every 3000 time steps until we have sampled 20 000 configurations unless otherwise specified .",
    "this amounts to an implementation of the generation of configurations in the canonical ensemble .",
    "the above md procedure works well for @xmath62 .",
    "however , two new features arise when it is applied to @xmath63 in all dimensions .",
    "first , the potential energy surface develops local minima and energy barriers that can trap the system if @xmath12 is too small .",
    "we address this problem by using simulated annealing , employing a thermodynamic cooling schedule @xcite which starts at @xmath64 and ends at @xmath65 .",
    "note that , by adopting a cooling schedule , we concede that we may only take one sample at the end of each md trajectory , whereas a fixed - temperature md trajectory produces multiple samples .",
    "the second new feature is that the entropically favored ground states are crystalline for @xmath63 .",
    "unlike disordered structures , a crystalline structure has long - range order and may not `` fit '' in simulation boxes with certain shapes . to overcome the second problem",
    ", we simulate an isothermal - isobaric ensemble with a deformable simulation box .",
    "every 20 md time steps , 10 monte carlo trial moves to deform the simulation box are attempted .",
    "the pressure is calculated from eq .",
    "( 41 ) of ref .  .",
    "we employed the wang - landau monte carlo @xcite to attempt to determine the entropically favored ground states for @xmath66 in two and three dimensions .",
    "the wang - landau monte carlo is used to calculate the microcanonical entropy @xmath67 as a function of the potential energy @xmath68 .",
    "we limit our simulations to the energy range @xmath69 ( in dimensionless units ) , where @xmath70 is the ground state energy , by rejecting any trial move that violates this energy tolerance .",
    "this energy range is evenly divided into 1000 bins .",
    "starting from a perfect crystal structure in a simulation box shaped like a fundamental cell , small perturbations are introduced so the energy is within the range .",

    "energy minimizations starting from md snapshots at different temperatures can yield ground states with different pair correlation functions . * for configurations obtained by minimizing energy starting from md snapshots at sufficiently small temperature , pair correlation functions do not depend on the minimization algorithm and the form of the stealthy potential .",

    "one important feature of collective - coordinate interactions is that it has uncountably infinitely degenerate classical ground states @xcite . in the case of isotropic pair interactions , the only other system that we know with this feature is the hard - sphere system",

    "first , while the dimensionality of the configuration space of equilibrium hard - sphere systems consisting of @xmath8 particles within a periodic box is fixed [ simply determined by the nontrivial number of degrees of freedom , @xmath121 , the dimensionality of the collective - coordinate ground - state configuration space decreases as @xmath4 increases and , on a per particle basis , eventually vanishes @xcite .",
    "the decreased dimensionality of the ground - state configuration space creates challenges for accurate sampling of the entropically favored ground states using numerical simulations and hence the development of better sampling methods is a fertile ground for future research .",
    "second , while the probability measure of the equilibrium hard - sphere system is uniform over its entire ground - state manifold , that of the stealthy ground states is not uniform . to illustrate this point ,",
    "imagine a one - dimensional energy landscape that has a double - well potential behavior in a portion of the configuration space , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig17 ] .",
    "each minimum represents a degenerate ground state ( as we find with stealthy potentials ) and therefore the well depths of the minima are the same .",

    "at very low temperature , to a good approximation , the system can only visit the part of the configuration space with energy less than @xmath127 , and @xmath128 as @xmath80 . solving @xmath129 , where @xmath130 , one finds the feasible region of configuration space associated with both wells : @xmath131and @xmath132 when @xmath133 , we see that the feasible regions associated with the two potential wells have different ranges .",
    "therefore , the weights associated with the two minima , i.e. , the relative probabilities for finding the system in the vicinity of those minima , will also differ .",
    "similarly , in the stealthy multidimensional configuration space that we are studying , the magnitude of the eigenvalues of the hessian matrix will determine the relative weights .",
    "therefore , the probability measure of the stealthy ground states is not uniform over the ground - state manifold , unlike the degenerate ground states of classical hard spheres .",
    "our low - temperature md simulations sample ground states with this nonuniform probability measure",

    "<S> these results show that as the density decreases from the high - density limit , the disordered ground states in the canonical ensemble are characterized by an increasing degree of short - range order and eventually the system undergoes a phase transition to crystalline ground states . in the crystalline regime ( low densities ) , there exist aperiodic structures that are part of the ground - state manifold , but yet are not entropically favored . </S>",
    "<S> we also provide numerical evidence suggesting that different forms of stealthy pair potentials produce the same ground - state ensemble in the zero - temperature limit . </S>",
    "<S> our techniques may be applied to sample the zero - temperature limit of the canonical ensemble of other potentials with highly degenerate ground states . </S>"
