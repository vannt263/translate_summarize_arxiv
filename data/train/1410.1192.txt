    "the relationship between a galaxy s spin ( angular momentum ) vector and its surrounding environment is of substantial importance to the understanding of galaxy formation and evolution . in the last century , simulations of large scale structure have produced a better understanding of spin alignment in the cosmic web ( faltenbacher et al . 2002 ; cuesta et al .",

    "investigations of alignment in specific environments ( voids , sheets , filaments , and nodes ) have been carried out using the well established tidal torque theory ( hoyle , 1949 ; peebles , p. j. e. , 1969 ; efstathiou , g. , et al .",

    "simulations predict that dark matter haloes above 10@xmath4 m@xmath5 should have spin vectors preferentially directed along the mid - plane of the sheet ( aragn - calvo et al . 2007 ; hahn et al . 2007 ; codis et al . 2012 ; trowland et al .",
    "however , such a prediction is untestable unless the assumption is made that spin vectors for dark and baryonic matter are aligned ( van den bosch et al .",

    "there have been many observational studies to look for alignment of baryonic spin with cosmic structure , but results have been contradictory . while some researchers have claimed to see alignment ( trujillo et al .",
    "2006 ; lee @xmath3 erdogdu 2007 ; paz et al .",
    "2008 ; jones et al .",

    "2010 ) . in those studies which find evidence for alignment",
    ", there is a preference for a disk galaxy to have its spin vector directed along the midplane of its host sheet ( trujillo et al .",
    "2006 ; varela et al . 2012",
    "; tempel et al . 2013 ; tempel @xmath3 libeskind 2013 ) .",
    "however , it is important to realize that observational studies constrain spin directions using axis ratios and position angles only .",
    "for face - on and edge - on galaxies , there are two possible solutions , and for inclined galaxies there are four .",
    "the ambiguity reduces the likelihood of a positive detection of alignment .",
    "galaxies within a distance of 6 mpc from the milky way are localized in a highly flattened configuration known as the local sheet which is distinct from the local supercluster ( peebles et al .",
    "2001 ; tully et al .",
    "2008 ; peebles @xmath3 nusser 2010 ; mccall 2014 ) .",
    "the extent ( diameter ) of the sheet is 10.4 mpc and the thickness ( 2@xmath6 vertical dispersion ) is 0.47 mpc . the sheet hosts 14 giants ( k@xmath0 @xmath1 -22.5 mag ) , of which 2 are in the local group and 12 beyond .",
    "those beyond are distributed around a ring with a radius of 3.75 mpc ( the council of giants ) whose centre is only 1.1 mpc from the centroid of the local group .",
    "mccall ( 2014 ) analyzed the distribution of spin vectors of the local sheet giants with respect to the giants beyond the local sheet in the local volume ( @xmath7 10 mpc ) .",
    "the local sheet giants have a distinct spin distribution from the giants beyond , with vectors arranged around a small circle on the celestial sphere .",
    "however , the spin vectors for giants beyond the local sheet are arranged around a great circle on the sky which is closely aligned with the supergalactic plane ( see figure [ fig : lvgs_spindist ] ) .",
    "the pole of this spin distribution , excluding the three outliers near the poles , is 23@xmath8 from the north galactic pole resulting in a sinusoidal trend in latitude .",
    "the mean supergalactic latitude of spin directions is only @xmath9 .",
    "indeed , coplanar spin vectors for galaxies in the luminosity range spanned is predicted by tidal torque theory .",
    "the distinct spin distribution observed for local sheet giants has been hypothesized to be the result of tidal torquing induced by the local group ( mccall 2014 ) .",
    "first of all , the local group contains 27@xmath2 of the mass of the sheet . by virtue of the pair of interacting giants which dominate it ,",
    "its mass distribution is highly asymmetrical .",
    "also , its location is such that surrounding giants are at comparable distances ; the radial dispersion is only @xmath10 mpc .",
    "thus , the local group is the most likely source of torquing .    )",
    "is shown as a horizontal blurred black line .",
    "the alignment of the giants with the supergalactic plane is in accordance with the prediction of tidal torque theory . ]",
    "to further our understanding of the effect of an interacting pair of galaxies on the spin alignments of galaxies in sheets , analogues of the local sheet were identified within the sloan digital sky survey data release 9 ( conidis @xmath3 mccall , in preparation ) . as controls",
    ", sheets were also identified in which the interacting pair is replaced with a single disk galaxy .",
    "it was expected that if an interacting pair torqued fellow sheet members , the two samples would show a distinct difference .",
    "an assessment of spin distributions was carried out by examining axis ratios for disk galaxies in both analogue and control sheets .",
    "axis ratio distributions were derived for edge - on sheets ( tilt @xmath11 ) and face - on sheets ( tilt @xmath12 ) . the control sheets were predicted to preserve their primordial spin organization , with spin vectors for members pointing along the midplanes of the sheets .",
    "this prediction implied that axis ratios for galaxies in a face - on sheet would be clustered about low values .",
    "figure [ fig : hists_both]a ( grey bars ) is the observed axis ratio distribution for the disk galaxies in face - on control sheets .",
    "it does not cluster at low axis ratios as expected .",
    "it is found that the analogues disk galaxies hosted in a face - on sheet configuration tend to favour a low b / a value ( figure [ fig : hists_both]a , black bars ) . in face - on analogue and control sheets , 56@xmath2 and 46@xmath2 , respectively , of the galaxy population displays b / a @xmath1 0.5 .",
    "furthermore the axis ratio distribution for face - on analogues and control have a 0.0029@xmath2 and 10.1@xmath2 chance , respectively , of being consistent with a random distribution . clearly indicating the analogue and control distributions are distinct from each other . as well , the control s face - on distribution can not be confidently distinguished from random . for edge - on analogue and control sheets ( figure [ fig : hists_both]b ) , 54@xmath2 and 45@xmath2 , respectively , of the galaxy population displays b / a @xmath1 0.5 .",
    "the axis ratio distributions for edge - on analogues and controls have a 0.025@xmath2 and 0.57@xmath2 chance , respectively , of being consistent with a random distribution .",
    "thus , both distributions are found to be distinct from random .",
    "cumulative distributions of the axis ratios of galaxies in analogue and control sheets are shown in figure [ fig : cdfs_both ] .",
    "the likelihood that the spin distributions for analogues and controls are drawn from the same probability distribution are 2.4@xmath2 and 3.1@xmath2 , respectively , for face - on and edge - on orientations .",
    "this clearly shows that an interacting pair of disk galaxies embedded near the centre of a sheet torques the spins of surrounding members .    ) .",

    "the distinct difference between the axis ratio distributions for analogue and control sheets , be they face - on or edge - on , validates the hypothesis that an interacting pair of galaxies changes the spin distribution of other members .",
    "this supports the conjecture that the local group was responsible for torquing the spins of galaxies in the local sheet out of alignment with the plane of the local supercluster .",
    "axis ratio distributions for galaxies in control sheets disagree with the predictions of tidal torque theory .",
    "especially , in face - on sheets , axis ratios do not cluster around low values and the distribution can be considered random within errors .",
    "surprisingly , the axis ratio distribution for face - on and edge - on analogues show a stronger tendency toward low axis ratios . as well , both these distributions are distinct from random providing additional evidence that a galaxy s orientation is environmentally dependant .",
    "analyses here are limited by the use of axis ratios as proxies for spin vectors . for a given axis ratio ,",
    "there are up to four spin directions possible .",
    "currently , the author is engaged in determining unambiguously three - dimensional spin vectors for the disk galaxies in sheets , which will make possible more definitive statements about alignments ( or lack thereof ) with structure .",
    "i would like to thank prof . marshall l. mccall for his insightful discussions and helpful comments while conducting this research and producing this document ."
