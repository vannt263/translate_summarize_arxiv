    "inherent structures or potential energy minima are important for determining the mechanical and dynamical properties of supercooled liquids and glasses @xcite .",
    "recently , a host of computational studies have attempted to relate thermodynamic quantities in supercooled liquids to the number of inherent structures and vibrational motions about them @xcite .",
    "it is often assumed in these calculations that all inherent structures at a given energy are equally probable .",
    "similarly , statistical descriptions of granular media assume that all stable particle packings at a particular volume are equally likely @xcite .",
    "thus , it is important to examine under what conditions and to what extent that inherent structures in glassy systems and jammed packings of granular materials are equally probable . in this short article , we begin to address this question by enumerating nearly all mechanically stable ( ms ) packings in small 2d bidisperse systems .",
    "an innovative feature of this work and our other recent study @xcite is that we focus on systems containing small numbers of disks .",
    "we note that related studies of small hard disk systems have been carried out previously , but these have not investigated the ms packing probabilities @xcite .",
    "we confine our studies to small 2d systems for two key reasons .",
    "first , we are able to generate nearly all of the mechanically stable disk packings in these systems .",
    "the number of ms disk packings grows exponentially with the number of particles @xmath1 , but is finite for any finite @xmath1 . in small systems , we are able to accurately determine the probability with which each ms packing occurs . in contrast , in large systems , only the most frequent ms packings are found .",
    "second , we believe that understanding small jammed systems is crucial to developing a theoretical explanation for slow stress and structural relaxation in large glassy and amorphous systems @xcite . our view of the relationship between jamming in small systems and glassy behavior in large systems will be more fully developed in a future publication @xcite .",
    "we discuss several important results below .",
    "first , we find that the frequency with which mechanically stable packings occur is not uniform , instead it can vary by many orders of magnitude over the range of packing fractions where ms packings exist .",
    "this large variation in frequency occurs even though we do not target specific packings .",
    "moreover , ms packings can have frequencies that differ by many orders of magnitude even over narrow packing - fraction intervals and there are no striking structural differences between rare and frequent ms packings at similar @xmath0 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare ] .",
    "thus , it is not immediately obvious what variables set the frequency of ms packings . also , we show below that even when we significantly alter the protocol used to generate the ms packings , the most frequent packings remain frequent and the rare ones remain rare .",
    "thus , we suggest that although it is clear that the particular protocol chosen to generate the ms packings plays some role in determining the frequency distribution of ms packings@xcite , prominent geometrical features of the configuration space can also strongly influence the frequency distribution .",
    "we study mechanically stable packings of @xmath2 disks that interact via the finite - range , pairwise additive , purely repulsive spring potential @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the characteristic energy scale , @xmath5 is the separation between particles @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath8 is their average diameter , and @xmath9 is the heaviside step function .",
    "we study @xmath10-@xmath10 binary mixtures of particles with diameter ratio @xmath11 to inhibit crystallization @xcite .",
    "the particles have equal mass @xmath12 and are confined to a square unit cell with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we chose the small particle diameter @xmath13 and @xmath14 as the reference length and time scales .",
    "our focus is on configurations that are at a potential energy minimum with infinitesimal overlaps . since these configurations are in mechanical equilibrium and possess vanishingly small overlaps , we term them mechanically stable ( ms ) packings .",
    "ms packings with no overlaps are equivalent to collectively jammed states @xcite of hard disks .",
    "we employ a class of packing - generation protocols that involve successive compression or decompression steps followed by energy minimization @xcite .",
    "the process is initiated by choosing random initial positions for the particles at packing fraction @xmath15 , which is well below the minimum packing fraction at which ms packings occur in 2d .",
    "the system is decompressed when the potential energy of the system at a local minimum is nonzero ; otherwise , the system is compressed .",
    "the increment by which the particle packing fraction is changed at each compression or decompression step is gradually decreased .",
    "after a sufficiently large number of steps a ms packing with infinitesimal overlaps is obtained .",
    "this process is performed for a large number of independent starting conditions to generate an ensemble of ms packings . in this way",
    ", we can measure the probability to obtain a ms packing at a given @xmath0 .",
    "we employ two energy - minimization methods : ( a ) conjugate - gradient ( cg ) minimization algorithm or ( b ) molecular dynamics ( md ) with dissipation proportional to local velocity differences .",
    "the conjugate - gradient method is a numerical scheme that begins at a given point in configuration space and moves the system to the nearest local potential energy minimum without traversing any energy barriers @xcite .",
    "in contrast , molecular dynamics with finite damping is not guaranteed to find the nearest local potential energy minimum since kinetic energy is removed from the system at a finite rate .",
    "the system can thus surmount a sufficiently low energy barrier . in the molecular dynamics method ,",
    "each particle @xmath6 obeys newton s equations of motion @xmath16 { \\hat{r}}_{ij},\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the acceleration of particle @xmath6 , @xmath18 is the relative velocity of particles @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath19 is the unit vector connecting the centers of these particles , and @xmath20 is the damping coefficient .",
    "note that in our previous studies @xcite we used only the cg method .      in our numerical simulations",
    "we distinguish distinct mechanically stable disk packings by the lists of eigenvalues of their dynamical matrices . for a pairwise additive , rotationally invariant potential ( [ spring potential ] ) the dynamical matrix",
    "is given by the expressions @xcite @xmath21 and @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in the above relations the indices @xmath6 and",
    "@xmath7 refer to the particles , and @xmath25 represent the cartesian coordinates . for a system with @xmath26 rattlers and @xmath27 particles forming a connected network the indices @xmath6 and @xmath7 range from @xmath28 to @xmath29 , because the rattlers do not contribute to the potential energy .",
    "the dynamical matrix is symmetric and has @xmath30 rows and columns , where @xmath31 is the spatial dimension .",
    "thus it has @xmath30 real eigenvalues @xmath32 , @xmath33 of which are zero due to translational invariance of the system . in a ms disk packing ,",
    "no set of particle displacements is possible without creating an overlapping configuration ; therefore the dynamical matrix has exactly @xmath34 nonzero eigenvalues . in our simulations we use the criterion @xmath35 for nonzero eigenvalues .",
    "we consider two ms packings to be the same if they have the same list of eigenvalues of the dynamical matrix .",
    "the eigenvalues are considered to be equal if they differ by less than the noise threshold @xmath36 for our calculations . using the cg and md methods , we have identified @xmath37 distinct ms packings for systems with @xmath38 particles .",
    "( packings with rattlers have been included in this count . )",
    "it is in general not true that each distinct ms packing possesses a unique packing fraction @xmath0 .",
    "however , we find that for these systems only at most a few percent of distinct ms packings share the same packing fraction .",
    "thus , in the following we will associate a unique @xmath0 with each ms packing to simplify the discussion .",
    "the principal result of this work is that the frequency with which ms packings occur can vary dramatically  by many orders of magnitude from one packing to another . in fig .",
    "[ fig : td ] , we show the probability @xmath39 to obtain a given ms packing at @xmath0 for the md energy minimization method . @xmath40 is the number of ms packings obtained at @xmath0 out of @xmath41 trials performed . for @xmath2 , we ran more than @xmath42 trials for both energy minimization methods and obtained results that do not depend on @xmath41 .",
    "we notice several interesting features in fig .",
    "[ fig : td ] .",
    "first , the probability distribution is not uniform .",
    "the most probable ms packings occur at large @xmath43 and the least probable occur for @xmath44 .",
    "when averaged over narrow packing - fraction intervals , probability distribution decays exponentially with decreasing @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "even more striking , the probability is not monotonic in packing fraction and is in fact noisy and difficult to predict . in the inset to fig .",
    "[ fig : td ] , we find that even over a narrow range @xmath45 , the probability varies by more than five orders of magnitude , and this occurs over the entire range of @xmath0 .    to understand the influence of the packing - generation protocol on our results , we have examined the probabilities for obtaining each ms packing using two energy minimization methods .",
    "we compared the @xmath46 most frequent ms packings obtained from the cg method to the @xmath46 most frequent packings from the md method .",
    "we find that @xmath47 of the ms packings were common to both sets ; these are shown as filled symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig : frequent ] . a similar comparison of probabilities for obtaining less frequent ms packings using the md and cg methods is also displayed ( using open symbols ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : frequent ] .",
    "we make several important observations .",
    "first , significant shuffling of frequent and rare packings does _ not _ occur  frequent packings remain frequent and rare ones remain rare .",
    "second , within each probability grouping ( i.e. filled versus open symbols ) the more frequent ms packings in the cg method become more frequent in the md method , while the less frequent packings from the cg method become more rare in the md method .",
    "although these results were obtained for small systems , we expect similar findings for large systems .",
    "the result that frequent packings become more frequent and rare ones become more rare when switching from cg to md energy minimization can be explained in part by considering the rate at which energy is dissipated in the system .",
    "the md energy minimization method utilizes a finite rate of energy dissipation .",
    "thus , at various points during the packing generation process , the system can in principle possess enough kinetic energy to jump out of a shallow basin corresponding to a rare ms packing and into the basin of a more frequent packing .",
    "this suggests that understanding the topography of configuration space surrounding ms packings is crucial to understanding the frequency of ms packings .",
    "also , the result that frequent ms packings remain frequent and rare ones remain rare when switching from the md to cg methods implies that geometrical features of configuration space strongly influence the frequency of ms packings .",
    "correlations between the frequency with which ms packings occur and the shape and volume of basins near each ms packing is a topic of our current investigations @xcite .",
    "we have enumerated nearly all of the distinct ms in small systems composed of @xmath10-@xmath10 mixtures of bidisperse disks .",
    "this has allowed us to accurately measure the probability to obtain each ms packing .",
    "we find that the probability is not uniform ",
    "packings with large @xmath0 are exponentially more likely than those at low @xmath0 . moreover , even over narrow packing - fraction intervals , distinct ms packings occur with frequencies that differ by many orders of magnitude .",
    "we have varied the packing - generation protocol and shown that these results do not change qualitatively , which suggests that geometrical features of configuration space strongly influence the packing frequencies .",
    "these results suggest that further work should be carried out to explicitly test the edwards assumption that stable grain packings are equally probable and similar assumptions about inherent structures .",
    "another intriguing possibility is that only the most frequent ms packings are relevant for slow dynamics in glassy and jammed systems .",
    "however , even if this were true , we must first understand what determines ms packing frequencies in order to identify correctly the relevant set of frequent ms packings .",
    "financial support from nsf grant numbers cts-0348175 ( gg , jb ) , dmr-0448838 ( gg , cso ) , and cts-0456703 ( cso ) is gratefully acknowledged .",
    "we also thank yale s high performance computing center for generous amounts of computer time ."
