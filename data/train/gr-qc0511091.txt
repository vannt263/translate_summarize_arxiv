    "the complete family of type d space - times with an aligned non - null electromagnetic field and a possibly non - zero cosmological constant @xmath0 can be represented by a metric that was given by plebaski and demiaski @xcite together with those that can be derived from it by certain transformations and limiting procedures .",
    "these solutions are characterised by two related quartic functions whose coefficients are determined by seven arbitrary parameters which include @xmath0 and both electric and magnetic charges .",
    "for the vacuum case with vanishing cosmological constant , they include all the particular solutions that were identified by kinnersley @xcite . for the sub - cases in which the repeated principal null congruences are expanding ,",
    "these metrics have been analysed further by weir and kerr @xcite , where the relations between the different forms of the line element can be deduced .",
    "( they have also been given independently by debever and kamran @xcite and ishikawa and miyashita @xcite . )",
    "unfortunately , many particular and well - known type d space - times are not included explicitly in the original form of the line element .",
    "they can only be obtained from it by using certain degenerate transformations . moreover ,",
    "the parameters that were introduced in the original papers are not the most useful ones for a physical interpretation of the solutions . one purpose of this paper is therefore to present a new form of the plebaski ",
    "demiaski metric in which the parameters are given a clear physical meaning and from which the various special cases can be obtained in a more satisfactory way . in this way",
    "we will clarify the complete family of solutions .",
    "a new look at these solutions seems to us to be particularly important at the present time because they are now being used in new ways .",
    "people working in semi - classical quantum gravity have used these metrics to investigate the pair production of black holes in cosmological backgrounds ( see e.g. @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "others are working to extend these solutions to higher dimensions . yet",
    "these solutions are still not well - understood at the classical level of general relativity .",
    "in particular , the physical significance of the parameters employed in the original forms are only properly identified in the most simplified special cases .",
    "thus the emphasis here is not to look for the most general metric form which covers all cases .",
    "this was achieved many years ago with the work of carter @xcite , debever _ et al _ @xcite , garca  d. @xcite and others .",
    "rather , our purpose is to cast the metric in a form in which the parameters employed have clear physical interpretations and thus to classify the complete family of solutions in a way that clarifies their physical properties .    in order to achieve this",
    ", we will first modify the original plebaski  demiaski metric to include two parameters , denoted by @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which respectively represent the acceleration of the sources and the twist of the repeated principal null congruences .",
    "then we will derive a more general form of the line element which explicitly contains all the well - known special subfamilies , at least for the cases in which the repeated principal null congruence is diverging and the orbits of the killing vectors are non - null .",
    "( the case in which the group orbits are null is not considered here . )",
    "the solutions contained in this family are characterized by two generally quartic functions whose coefficients are related to the physical parameters of the space - time .",
    "one of our main purposes is to clarify the physical meaning of these coefficients which have traditionally been misinterpreted in the general case . in particular",
    ", we locate the cosmological constant in the most appropriate place and identify the relation between the plebaski ",
    "demiaski parameter @xmath3 and the nut parameter .",
    "it has also been traditional to use an available coordinate freedom to remove the linear term in one of these quartics .",
    "however , as noted by hong and teo in a particular case @xcite , @xcite , it is much more helpful to use the freedom to simplify the roots of this quartic .",
    "it will be shown that this helps very significantly both in the interpretation of these solutions and also in performing the associated calculations .    in section  3",
    ", we will review the family of solutions of this type which possess space - like surfaces of positive curvature .",
    "these include the solutions which are considered to have greatest physical significance as they relate to the fields around generalised forms of black holes .",
    "after that , we consider the complete families of non - accelerating and then non - twisting solutions in more detail .    in practice , it is convenient to distinguish the cases in which the repeated principal null directions are either expanding or non - expanding .",
    "a separate general form of the metric is required for the non - expanding case .",
    "such a form is derived in section  [ nonexpsolns ] using a degenerate transformation of our initial metric .",
    "as the twist also vanishes in this limit , it follows that these solutions must be type  d members of the solutions of kundt s class  a result that is demonstrated explicitly .",
    "finally , we identify the members of this family of solutions which reduce to the bertotti  robinson solution , or other direct product space - times , in an appropriate limit .",
    "we consider here a general family of type  d solutions of einstein s equations including a generally non - zero cosmological constant @xmath0",
    ". these may be vacuum or include a non - null electromagnetic field such that the two repeated principal null congruences of the weyl tensor are aligned with the two principal null congruences of the non - null electromagnetic field .",

    "it can thus be seen that the topological singularity on the axis which causes the acceleration , and the singularity on the axis associated with the nut parameter and the existence of closed timelike lines ( see e.g. @xcite ) , are mathematically independent . they may each be set on whatever parts of the axis may be considered to be most physically significant .    intriguingly , there exists a possibility that the conical singularity may vanish on both halves of the axis simultaneously .",

    "<S> the plebaski  demiaski metric , and those that can be obtained from it by taking coordinate transformations in certain limits , include the complete family of space - times of type  d with an aligned electromagnetic field and a possibly non - zero cosmological constant . starting with a new form of the line element which is better suited both for physical interpretation and for identifying different subfamilies , we review this entire family of solutions . </S>",
    "<S> our metric for the expanding case explicitly includes two parameters which represent the acceleration of the sources and the twist of the repeated principal null congruences , the twist being directly related to both the angular velocity of the sources and their nut - like properties . </S>",
    "<S> the non - expanding type  d solutions are also identified . </S>",
    "<S> all special cases are derived in a simple and transparent way . </S>"
