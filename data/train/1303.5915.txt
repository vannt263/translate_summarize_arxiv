    "the pioneer work by pestun @xcite on the partition function of four - dimensional ( 4d ) @xmath0 theories has served as a trigger to great progress on localization computation of supersymmetric gauge theories in diverse dimensions and on various manifolds @xcite .",
    "localization of three - dimensional ( 3d ) theories is a focus of recent attention .",
    "kapustin , willett , and yaakov @xcite extended pestun s idea to gauge theories on @xmath1 , and they obtained matrix model representations for the supersymmetric partition functions of these theories .",
    "we can solve these matrix models in large-@xmath2 limit , for instance the abjm partition function was computed by drukker , marino , and putrov @xcite .",
    "they found that the free energy of the abjm theory actually shows the @xmath3-scaling behavior which had been suggested by the ads / cft argument .",
    "this result is a typical example of the power of the localization approach .",
    "the efficiency of localization reaches beyond large-@xmath2 approximation .",
    "the matrix models for partition functions of @xmath0 gauge theories on @xmath1 was derived in @xcite .",
    "the integrant of this matrix model consists of a complicated combination of double - sine functions , and it looks hard on first glance to evaluate it exactly . in @xcite , however , the authors succeeded to solve these matrix models exactly .",
    "in particular the partition functions of 3d @xmath0 @xmath4 theories computed in @xcite show the following factorization property : @xmath5 = \\sum_i z_{\\textrm{vort}}^{(i)}\\,\\widetilde{z}_{\\textrm{anti - vort}}^{(i)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the k - theoretic vortex / antivortex partition function @xcite on @xmath8 .",
    "the summation is taken over the supersymmetric ground states which specify the vortex sector .",
    "this factorization into vortexes is 3d analogue of pestun s expression @xmath9 = \\int da\\ , z_{\\textrm{inst}}(a)\\,\\widetilde{z}_{\\textrm{anti - inst}}(a).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this 4d case , ground states are labeled by the continuous moduli parameter @xmath10 , so we take the integral over it after combining the contributions from instantons and anti - instantons .",
    "3d factorization is therefore expected to originate from the localization after changing the way of it .    in this article",
    "we prove the factorization of this type actually occurs in non - abelian gauge theories .",
    "the matrix model for a non - abelian theory involves a complicated interaction , and so it is not easy to compute it straightforwardly .",
    "we therefore employ the cauchy formula and we resolve the problem into that of abelian theory .",
    "we fond that the factorized partition function is consistent with the vortex / antivortex partition functions for the corresponding non - abelian theory .",
    "our result strongly supports the conjecture @xcite on the factorization of generic 3d @xmath0 theories .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we review the factorization of supersymmetric partition functions and superconformal indexes of 3d @xmath0 gauge theories . in section 3 , we compute exactly the partition functions of non - abelian gauge theories based on the matrix model representation coming from localization .",
    "we then find that the partition functions are actually factorized into the holomorphic blocks .",
    "the topological string interpretation of these holomorphic blocks is given in section 4 .",
    "section 5 is devoted to discussions of our results and future directioins .",
    "in this section we provide a review of localization and the resulting factorization of the partition function and the superconformal index of a 3d gauge theory with @xmath0 supersymmetry .",
    "the factorization is only conjecture yet for generic @xmath0 theories , however , there exists a nice geometric interpretation of this phenomenon .",
    "the partition functions of 3d theories were calculated with the help of supersymmetric localization .",
    "the path integral for a theory on squashed three - sphere is @xmath11-t\\{q , v\\}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for suitable choice of the scalar supercharge @xmath12 and the deformation action @xmath13 , we can calculate it exactly in the limit @xmath14 @xcite . as we will review in appendix b ,",
    "the partition function then becomes a kind of matrix model .",
    "the factorization of these partition functions of 3d abelian theories was found by pasquetti in @xcite .",
    "@xmath15 where the operation @xmath16 in the sum acts for instance as @xmath17 .",
    "so this pairing involves the s - duality transformation , and we call it the @xmath18-pairing",
    ". the geometric meaning of the s - transformation will be clear in this section .",
    "the supersymmetric index is also important quantity to catch a part of quantum dynamics of theory .",
    "the 3d superconformal index , which is defined for a 3d scft , is the following trace taken over the hilbert space of the theory on @xmath19 : @xmath20 here @xmath21 is a cartan generator of the flavor symmetry .",
    "the bosonic parti of the 3d @xmath22 superconformal group is @xmath23 , and the quantum numbers under the cartan generators of its compact subgroup @xmath24 label the states of the 3d theory",
    ". then the above superconformal index counts the bps states for @xmath25 and @xmath26 : @xmath27 so this index does not depend on @xmath28 , and we can take the limit @xmath29 to evaluate it .    on the one hand we can write down the index as a twisted partition function of a 3d theory defined on the curved space - time @xmath30 , @xmath31-t\\{q , v\\ } } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the index was also calculated by using the localization formula @xcite , and then the path integral reduces to an ordinary integral over the cartan of the gauge group via supersymmetric localization @xcite .",
    "factorization for the resulting expression of the index was predicted in @xcite @xmath32 in @xcite this conjecture is studied in more detail .",
    "for 3d abelian gauge theories , it is observed that this building block @xmath33 of the index is identical with that of the factorized partition function in @xcite .",
    "the difference is the meaning of the conjugated variables @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the conjugation here is merely the inversion @xmath36 , and we call this paring the @xmath37-pairing .    -gluing of two @xmath38 s : the trivial decomposition of @xmath30 .",
    "( b ) the @xmath18-gluing of two @xmath38 s : the heegaard decomposition of three - sphere @xmath1 through the s element of the mapping class group @xmath39.,width=453 ]    in @xcite , it is proposed that the above - mentioned factorization originates in geometry on which the quantum field theory is defined .",
    "as _ * figure * _ * _ _ * [ fig;dec ] , @xmath30 and @xmath1 are @xmath37- and @xmath18-gluing of a pair of solid tori @xmath40 . actually the squashed sphere @xmath41 , on which our discussion focuses , is the @xmath18-gluing of two half geometries @xmath42 , and this building block is the melvin cigar @xcite where @xmath43 fibers over @xmath44 with holonomy @xmath45 . in @xcite",
    "the authors defined the holomorphic blocks as the partition functions on this melvin cigar @xmath42 .",
    "this partition function is just the wave function for the hilbert space on the asymptotic @xmath46 . here",
    "@xmath47 is the infinite time direction , and then a state evolves into a ground state as @xmath48 .",
    "in this way the wave function depends on the choice of the supersymmetric vacuum @xmath49 which specifies a state on the boundary @xmath50 .",
    "then the gluing of two geometries through an element of @xmath39 implies the following form of the partition function on the total geometry : @xmath51 this is the geometric origin of the factorization which was conjectured in @xcite .",
    "as we mentioned , the factorization is actually observed in abelian partition functions and non - abelian superconformal indexes .",
    "so in order to verify this conjecture for a wide range of 3d theories , we have to confirm the factorization phenomenon for partition functions of non - abelian gauge theories . in the following sections ,",
    "we show that non - abelian partition functions actually factorize into the holomorphic blocks which are consistent with superconformal index @xcite and have a nice 3d interpretation .",
    "the following matrix model gives the partition function of @xmath0 @xmath52 gauge theory with @xmath53 fundamentals and @xmath54 anti - fundamentals on squashed three - sphere @xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the chern - simons coupling , @xmath57 is the fi - parameter for the @xmath4 factor , and @xmath58 is the squashing parameter for the three - sphere .",
    "we give masses for fundamental and anti - fundamental chiral field .",
    "when @xmath59 , this theory is the mass deformation of @xmath60 sqcd and a pair of a fundamental and an anti - fundamental chirals forms a hypermultiplet of the @xmath60 theory .",
    "the deformation of @xmath61 type is the vector mass for the original hypermultiplet , and @xmath62 type is the axial mass . in the following ,",
    "we turn on these mass deformations .",
    "we start with studying @xmath52 non - chiral gauge theory whose matter content consists of @xmath22 mass deformation of @xmath63 hypermultiplets .",
    "the localized partition function is @xmath64 for @xmath65 we can enclose the integral contour in the upper half - plane as _ * figure * _ * _ _ * [ fig;cont ] , and in @xcite the author employed it for generic chern - simons coupling . in this paper",
    "we follow the argument there .        to evaluate the matrix model for non - abelian theory @xmath66 , the best strategy is to translate this ",
    "many - body \" problem into that of abelian theory , or a collection of non - interacting one - body systems .",
    "this idea of  abelianization \" plays a role in solving many problems in for instance @xcite , and the cauchy formula is the key in these articles .",
    "the cauchy formula implies @xmath67 for auxiliary variables @xmath68 ( mod@xmath69 ) .",
    "so with this formula , we can resolve thesinh - interaction \" between  particles \" @xmath70 into a collection of one - particle systems in a background @xmath71 .",
    "we therefore use this formula as a separation of variables of our problem .    substituting the formula ( [ cauh ] ) into the partition function",

    "this integral is essentially equal to that was computed in @xcite , and we provide an explicit computation in appendix c. by computing this integral exactly , we find the following factorized form of the partition function of the 3d non - chiral theory : @xmath74 here the summation is taken over the sequece of integers @xmath75 , which labels the supersymmetric ground states of the theory on @xmath76 .",
    "the perturbative part is given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 the remaining parts , which are the holomorphic blocks , take the form @xmath79 these blocks are precisely equal to the 3d ( k - theoretic ) uplift of the vortex and anti - vortex partition functions @xcite for @xmath52 gauge theory with @xmath53 antifundamental and @xmath80 fundamental chiral multiplets .",
    "the coulomb branch and the mass parameters for the vortex theory are @xmath81 see appendix c for detailed computation and discussion .",
    "the classical and 1-loop part @xmath82 is basically a product of those of @xmath4 theory , and we can show that it is precisely the purtabative part of the vortex / antivortex partition function @xcite .",
    "actually , we have the factorization of the 1-loop contributions @xcite @xmath83 where @xmath84 the prefactor @xmath85 can be absorbed into the classical part , up to irrelevant overall coefficient @xmath86 , by changing the fi parameters @xcite @xmath87 we thus obtain the factorization of the non - chiral @xmath52 theory as a natural extension of that of @xmath4 theory : @xmath88 as we had expected , the holomorphic block @xmath89 coming from this factorization coincides with that of the superconformal index of the same gauge theory @xcite .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the single holomorphic block leads to not only the partition function but also the superconformal index of the vector - like gauge theory . as we will see in below",
    ", this fact holds for chiral theories .    in the next section",
