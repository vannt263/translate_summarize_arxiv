    "random matrix theory ( rmt ) is the study of random matrices with various symmetry conditions imposed on the matrix entries . with scant warning",
    "this young theory has permeated nearly every area of modern physics and even number theory @xcite . in quantum physics ,",
    "random matrices can be used to model the behaviour of hamiltonians or scattering matrices , and many statistical properties of chaotic quantum systems have been found to agree with the appropriate predictions from rmt @xcite . in recent decades",
    "attempts have been made to further refine what has become the canonical theory , by considering symmetries which allow the matrix representations of quantum potentials to impose @xmath1-body interactions between the particles in a system containing @xmath0 particles ( @xmath2 ) . here",
    "the main new feature is that such an interaction , when applied to one of the states with @xmath0 particles , will annihilate @xmath1 particles and create @xmath1 particles in ( possibly ) different single - particle states .",
    "this means that matrix elements between many - particle states that differ by more than @xmath1 occupied single - particle states will necessarily be zero .",
    "canonical rmt , containing no such restrictions , can be associated with the case @xmath8 .",
    "the case @xmath9 describes random single - particle potentials and hopping terms .",
    "although the most common interactions have @xmath10 it remains of great interest to determine the statistics of such interactions for the whole physically relevant domain @xmath2 .",
    "the appropriate generalization of canonical rmt involves _ embedding _ the _ k_-body potential into the _ m_-particle state space creating what has become known as the embedded ensembles .",
    "the embedded ensembles , first introduced by mon and french @xcite in 1975 , gave physicists a powerful framework for studying many - body interactions using random matrix theory .",
    "( see @xcite for reviews , and @xcite for the related two - body random ensemble . ) in particular , the embedded gaussian unitary ensemble of random matrices ( egue ) represents the hamiltonian of non time - reversal invariant quantum systems of @xmath0 particles interacting under the force of a @xmath1-body potential , so called because the potential is a sum of interaction terms between @xmath1-tuples of particles .",
    "in addition , many - body hamiltonians of a similar form are used independently to study the statistics of quantum spin chains , spin glasses and ( hyper)graphs @xcite and recent developments point to a convergence of some statistical properties between these models @xcite .    in one of the main contributions to this area benet",
    ", rupp and weidenmller @xcite showed how a process of eigenvector expansions could be used to calculate certain statistical properties of @xmath1-body potentials , in particular the fourth moment of the average level density .",
    "though a great advance , the eigenvector expansion method is complex to implement , and it remains unclear if it can practically be used to calculate moments higher than the fourth .",
    "the method of supersymmetry , also used in @xcite to investigate the fourth moment , is accompanied by technical difficulties in the loop expansion , and does not allow one to access the regime @xmath11 .",
    "a further technique used to treat embedded ensembles is the trace propagation method @xcite . using a new method however , which utilises feynman - like diagrams to simplify calculations",
    ", we will show that it becomes possible to calculate the fourth , sixth and eighth moments for embedded ensembles in a straightforward way .",
    "the method , which we will call the method of _ particle diagrams _ , is designed to probe the order of magnitude of combinatorial expressions prior to calculating them explicitly .",
    "we will specifically be interested in the case where , in correspondence with many physical systems , the number of available single - particle states @xmath3 is taken to infinity . in this limit estimating the order of magnitude provides a sufficient excuse not to calculate certain terms at all , since we can foretell using particle diagrams that they will not survive in this asymptotic regime .",
    "hence by applying the method of particle diagrams one is in effect washing out much of the complexity of the problem , with enough details remaining to yield limiting statistics .",
    "we will present this technique in detail here , significantly extending our previous rapid communication @xcite .",
    "first , we will introduce the method using the fourth moment as an example .",
    "afterwards we will proceed to the sixth and eighth moments , using a further methodological development that involves studying closed loops on particle diagrams .",
    "a general feature of our results will be a gradual transition from the moments of a semi - circular average level density for @xmath4 to gaussian moments for large @xmath0 , or more precisely in the dilute limit @xmath12 .",
    "reassuringly , the semi - circular regime contains the case @xmath13 corresponding to canonical rmt .",
    "the gaussian behaviour is in line with early observations in @xcite as well as results for quantum spin chains and graphs @xcite .",
    "our general result , interpolating between these two regimes , will be a sum over binomial expressions depending on @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    ". we will see that as @xmath0 is increased the terms responsible for the transition in the @xmath7-th moment ( at least for @xmath14 ) start to contribute immediately from @xmath15 .",
    "correspondingly , if we increase @xmath1 for fixed @xmath0 we have fewer and fewer terms contributing , with contributions vanishing after @xmath16 ; after reaching @xmath17 all subsequent values of the moments are semi - circular .",
    "this form of the transition is consistent with @xcite for the fourth moment but differs from the case of spin glasses where , translated into our notation , the transition occurs when @xmath0 is of the order of @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "in this section we reproduce a known result for the normalised fourth moment , or kurtosis , of the level density for the egue using a simpler alternate calculation to that found in @xcite .",
    "this will serve as a platform for introducing both the basic definitions of the field and the new methodology involving particle diagrams which this paper sets out to explain .",
    "we will consider states of @xmath0 fermions in a system with @xmath19 single - particle states , all interacting under the action of a _",
    "k_-body potential ( @xmath2 ) with an identical gaussian _",
    "p.d.f _ determining its independent entries .",
    "we will neglect spin .",
    "our results will thus apply if the available states are either not distinguished by a spin degree of freedom ; or alternatively if the modelled hamiltonians have no specific features related to spin ( such as coupling terms involving a spin operator ) so that the interactions can be randomised in the same way regardless of whether the interacting states are distinguished by spin or other degrees of freedom .",
    "a generalization to bosons will be given in subsection [ bosons ] .",
    "the single - particle creation and annihilation operators are @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively with @xmath22 and we define a shorthand notation for products of these with the abbreviation @xmath23 , @xmath24 ( similarly for @xmath25",
    ". a useful corollary of this is @xmath26 we will write the orthonormal @xmath0-particle states as @xmath27 , etc , where each state takes the form @xmath28 with @xmath29 denoting the vacuum state and the restriction @xmath30 . the @xmath1-body potential @xcite is given by @xmath31 which can now be abbreviated to @xmath32 as we are considering fermions all @xmath0-particle states are assumed to contain only non - repeating single - particle states and since the number of allowed single - particle states is @xmath3 , the dimension of the @xmath0-body state space is @xmath33 . for the embedded gue ensemble presently under consideration",
    "the only symmetry condition on the potential is that it be hermitian @xmath34 for all @xmath35 which implies that @xmath36 matching coefficients gives @xmath37 as in canonical rmt ( where @xmath8 ) we suppose that matrix elements not related by hermitian symmetry are uncorrelated _",
    "i.i.d _ complex gaussian random variables with mean zero and variance @xmath38 and without loss of generality we take @xmath39 . hence for uncorrelated",
    "@xmath40 and @xmath41 one has @xmath42 whereas for @xmath43 the average instead becomes unity so that @xmath44 the analogous relation for matrix elements of @xmath45 is @xmath46 here summation over repeated indices @xmath47 is implied .",
    "the quantity @xmath48 will be a crucial ingredient for the following calculations .",
    "( note the unusual ordering of indices in line with the notation of @xcite . ) for @xmath48 to be non - vanishing @xmath49 and @xmath50 must both contain the @xmath1 single - particle states included in @xmath51 , and @xmath52 and @xmath53 must both contain the @xmath1 single - particle states included in @xmath54 .",
    "in addition @xmath55 and @xmath56 have to contain the same single - particle states implying that @xmath52 and @xmath49 coincide in the @xmath57 single - particle states not included in @xmath51 or @xmath54 , and the same applies to @xmath50 and @xmath53 .",
    "these relations are illustrated by _",
    "particle diagrams _ as in fig .",
    "[ fig : square ] where solid bonds @xmath58 connect states sharing @xmath57 single - particle states and dashed bonds @xmath59 connect many - particle states sharing @xmath1 single - particle states .",
    "note that in the figure the overlaps indicated by neighbouring bonds are disjoint , e.g. , the single - particle states of @xmath51 form the overlap @xmath60 but are excluded from the overlap @xmath61 because the state @xmath49 contains @xmath0 non - repeated single - particle states . furthermore note that every single - particle state included in @xmath49 is also included in either @xmath50 ( due to the overlap @xmath62 ) or in @xmath52 ( due to the overlap @xmath61 ) .",
    "a similar argument applies to @xmath53 .",
    "as the sizes of all states are equal this implies that the union of the many - particle states @xmath49 and @xmath53 coincides with the union of @xmath52 and @xmath50 .",
    "fixing either @xmath49 and @xmath53 , or @xmath52 and @xmath50 thus determines all participating single - particle states .",

    "each bond between compound states represents a set of single - particle states shared by both of the compound states . ]",
    "we are now interested in moments of the level density @xmath64 of @xmath45 .",
    "these moments can be expressed through traces of the powers of @xmath45 using the fact that @xmath65 .",
    "after ensemble averaging the odd moments trivially vanish , because for odd @xmath66 positive and negative contributions mutually cancel . using the second moment for normalization",
    "we thus have to evaluate the @xmath7-th moments given by@xmath67 we start with the fourth moment , or kurtosis @xmath68 the terms in the numerator and in the denominator of @xmath69 can be evaluated using wick s law which expresses the gaussian average as a sum over all ways to draw contraction lines between the factors @xmath45 , @xmath70 here the brackets @xmath71 are used as an alternative notation for the ensemble average .",
    "we note that the first two contributions to ( [ trv4 ] ) coincide due to cyclic invariance of the trace .",
    "we can now write out the traces of powers in terms of matrix elements .",
    "wick s theorem then allows us to compute the averages of contracted matrix elements as if the remaining elements were absent .",
    "the result can be expressed in terms of ( [ eq : ee46 ] ) , leading to @xmath72 with the summations over repeated indices @xmath73 implicit .",
    "the required expressions for higher moments of the level density will look similar but with more factors @xmath74 , and ( unless further simplification is possible ) each many - particle subscript has to appear twice .    in ( [ eq : ee49 ] ) given the restrictions from fig .",
    "[ fig : square ] we have to sum over all @xmath52 and @xmath50 sharing @xmath57 single - particle states .",
    "there are @xmath75 states in the sum over all possible @xmath52 , @xmath76 ways to choose the overlap with @xmath50 , and @xmath77 ways to choose the rest of @xmath50 .",
    "hence the result is @xmath78      in this paper we are interested only in the limit @xmath79 .",
    "we can thus use stirling s formula @xmath80 ( with @xmath81 denoting asymptotic equality in the limit @xmath79 ) to approximate @xmath82 for fixed @xmath83 and thus @xmath84 for traces of higher powers of @xmath45 we will similarly encounter binomial or multinomial factors of the type @xmath85 or @xmath86 .",
    "these factors count ways to select from all @xmath3 single - particle state ( or a number already reduced by @xmath87 or @xmath88 ) sets of @xmath89 states to be included in the relevant many - particle states appearing as subscripts of the factors @xmath74 . to be able to handle the limit @xmath79 efficiently",
    ", we define the _ _ argument @xmath90 of an @xmath3-dependent binomial expression as its dominating power in @xmath3 , leading to @xmath91 = \\sum_n i_n b_n\\ ] ] and @xmath92 physically the argument thus gives the overall number of single - particle states included in the many - particle states .",
    "the argument of the numerator in the definition of the moments ( [ eq : moments ] ) will always turn out to be smaller or equal to the argument of the denominator .",
    "this implies a huge simplification : for every contribution to the moments we only have to consider those choices for @xmath89 that _ maximise the argument _ of the numerator , and thus the number of participating single - particle states . in case",
    "even these choices lead to an argument smaller than the one in the denominator , the corresponding contribution can be ignored completely . if the argument is equal the case of maximal argument in the numerator is sufficient to fully determine the contribution to the moments in the limit @xmath79 up to corrections of order @xmath93 or smaller .",
    "this approach washes out much of the complexity attendant to the study of embedded ensembles .    for later reference",
    "it is useful to note that due to ( [ divisor ] ) the denominator of the @xmath7-th moment ( [ eq : moments ] ) has the argument @xmath94 . and",
    "since @xmath95 the contributions to @xmath96 thus have to involve @xmath97 single - particle states in order to be relevant in the limit @xmath79 . also for later reference , we want to state the asymptotic form of the most common type of multinomial to be found below . using ( [ factorial ] )",
    "one can show that @xmath98 which combines with ( [ divisor ] ) and the asymptotics of @xmath99 to give @xmath100 where @xmath1 is again repeated @xmath101 times .      for the term @xmath102 in ( [ eq : ee52 ] ) and many terms in higher - order moments",
    "there is a further simplification , due to the fact that at least one factor @xmath74 has coinciding first and second , or third and fourth subscripts representing neighbouring many - particle states in fig . [",
    "fig : square ] .",
    "this situation always arises when wick contractions connect two neighbouring factors @xmath45 , so that either the @xmath103 and @xmath104 or @xmath105 and @xmath106 in the arising factor @xmath107 coincide . in this case",
    "one can show that a contribution to the moments is obtained only if the other two subscripts of this @xmath74 coincide as well . taking the factor @xmath108 as an example we have to consider the diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : square ] with @xmath109 .",
    "the many - particle state @xmath109 then contains @xmath1 states forming the bond @xmath62 and @xmath57 further states .",
    "given that each state is the union of the two attached bonds this means that the remaining @xmath57 states must form the bonds @xmath61 and @xmath110 , which have to be identical .",
    "then the states @xmath52 and @xmath53 share both the latter bond and the bond @xmath111 . as a consequence they have to coincide as well .",
    "whenever we encounter a contribution like this we thus have to ( i ) evaluate the remaining product of @xmath74 s for the case @xmath112 and then ( ii ) take into account the additional freedom of choice due to the factor @xmath113 .",
    "( i ) leads to a term already contributing to a lower - order moment , with the index @xmath112 appearing twice and no occurrences of @xmath50 . for ( ii )",
    "one uses that @xmath114 and @xmath112 have to share @xmath57 states , and there are @xmath115 ways to select these out of the @xmath0 states in @xmath52 .",
    "the remaining @xmath1 states in @xmath50 can be chosen among all @xmath116 states not already included .",
    "altogether step ( ii ) thus leads to a factor @xmath117 .",
    "due to ( [ eq : arg3 ] ) this compensates one of the factors @xmath118 in the denominator ( even for finite @xmath3 ! ) .",
    "we thus get back a diagram contributing to a lower moment , and if the normalization is taken into account we see that this diagram gives the same contribution as the original one .",
    "if the result of ( i ) again involves identical subscripts in a factor @xmath74 this procedure can be applied recursively leading to a diagram of an even lower order .",
    "applying this idea to the first term in the fourth moment and afterwards invoking ( [ eq : arg3 ] ) we obtain @xmath119 at the level of contraction lines , the present procedure amounts to removing two neighbouring factors @xmath45 connected by contraction lines .",
    "recursive application , if possible , allows to remove more of these factors and lines .",
    "if none of the contraction lines intersect , all @xmath45 can be removed in this way and as in ( [ reduced_example ] ) the final result is just the multiplicity factor of the diagram .    for an interpretation in terms of particle diagrams one can draw the states identifying @xmath52 and @xmath53 and then represent the overlap of @xmath57 states between by a `` tail '' @xmath120 .",
    "our result implies that such tails can be removed from the diagram without changing its normalised contribution .",

    "we see that all pairs of neighbouring many - particle states are connected by one bond @xmath123 indicating that they have to share @xmath57 single - particle states and by one bond @xmath124 in a different colour indicating @xmath1 shared states . a priori it is not clear how these two sets of shared single - particle states are related .",
    "however we have seen that in the limit @xmath79 we only need to consider the configuration maximising the overall number of single - particle states participating in the diagram under consideration .",
    "we can now use the fact that , by the reasons given in subsection [ embedded_subsection ] , all single - particle states participating in the diagram are determined by @xmath52 and @xmath50 . hence the number of single - particle states becomes maximal if @xmath52 and @xmath50 are as distinct as possible .",
    "if we now consider @xmath53 we see that each single - particle state in @xmath53 is included in one of the disjoint bonds @xmath111 and @xmath125 , and in one of the disjoint bonds @xmath126 and @xmath127 . however if any single - particle state is included in a bond leading from @xmath53 to @xmath52 and a bond leading from @xmath53 to @xmath50 this gives rise to an overlap between @xmath52 and @xmath50 . hence in order to keep @xmath52 and @xmath50 as distinct as possible we are compelled to include as many states as possible in two bonds leading to the same node @xmath52 or @xmath50 .",
    "this is achieved if e.g. the smaller set of @xmath128 single - particle states shared by @xmath52 and @xmath53 is included in the larger set of @xmath129 states shared by the same two many - particle states .",

    "we will now show that these @xmath131 single - particle states are the same for all pairs of neighbouring nodes and form the minimum possible overlap between @xmath52 and @xmath50 . to explain this",
    "let us first assume that we have @xmath132 and thus @xmath133 , @xmath134 meaning that each bond @xmath123 involves @xmath1 single - particle states also included in the corresponding bond @xmath124 as well as @xmath135 further states .",

    "this means that they have to be part of the bond @xmath125 but they may not be part of the bond @xmath127 . hence they are also part of the neighbouring set of states included in the larger bond but not the smaller one . arguing like this for all further pairs of neighbouring states and generalizing the same reasoning to @xmath4 , we see that there is just one common set of @xmath136 single - particle states shared by all larger bonds and omitted from all smaller bonds in the diagram .    to sum over all relevant choices of states giving non - zero contributions we have to sum over all ways to partition @xmath3 available single particle states into four different sets of @xmath137 states , one set of @xmath138 states , and the rest .",

    "however in the limit @xmath79 the number of additional summands added to the @xmath1-body potential due to this modification is negligible compared to the number of terms without repetitions inside @xmath51 and @xmath54 .",
    "for this reason we expect that that the results obtained in this limit will also carry over to the definition of @xcite and again give agreement with the fermionic case .",
    "if the fourth moment confirmed that the method of particle diagrams can greatly simplify calculations , the sixth moment illustrates the flexibility of the method as well as its ability to scale .",
    "for the sixth moment we transition from flat particle diagrams to three - dimensional graph - like diagrams .",
    "indeed , we will begin to use the terminology of graphs in the following calculations .",
    "in addition to @xmath178 ( states ) and _ bonds _ we will also consider @xmath179 ( sequences of neighbouring nodes ) and @xmath180 on the particle diagrams ( first state in path = last state in path ) , and these will become important tools for maximising the argument of attendant binomial expressions .    the sixth moment of the level density is given by @xmath181 and using wick s theorem we obtain @xmath182 here the prefactors indicate the number of equivalent diagrams that can be obtained by cyclic permutation of the trace . written in terms of @xmath48",
    "the summands are as follows : @xmath183 the first three terms involve contractions between neighbouring @xmath45 and hence have coinciding subscripts in some of the factors .",
    "these terms can be reduced to lower - order contributions using the results in subsection [ identical ] .",
    "taking into account the normalization factors we obtain @xmath184 here we used the results for the fourth moment contribution ( [ reduced_example ] ) in the first two lines , and ( [ standard_result ] ) in the third line .",
    "in the first two lines the nontrivial factors in the numerator and denominator compensate exactly and the results are integers , in line with the general behaviour if contraction lines do not intersect . the particle diagram responsible for the third line is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : tail ] ; it is identical to the `` standard diagram '' except for the addition of a tail @xmath185 .    ; the diagram requires @xmath186 to contribute and it is depicted only for this case . ]      this leaves only two diagrams that can not be reduced to diagrams already contributing to the fourth moment .",
    "for these diagrams , as well as more complicated particle diagrams to follow , the task of identifying the relevant overlaps between states becomes more and more involved , and it is desirable to have a more algorithmic approach .",
    "this can be realised by considering the particle diagram as a graph , and studying closed loops on this graph .    to understand the relevance of closed loops , consider a single - particle state @xmath187 that belongs to a many - particle state @xmath188 appearing in a given diagram .",
    "this @xmath188 has to appear twice as a subscript in the product of @xmath74 s .",
    "if it appears twice as a subscript of the same @xmath74 we can apply the procedure of subsection [ identical ] to simplify the diagram and relate it to a contribution to a lower moment .",
    "hence we can restrict ourselves to the case that the two subscripts belong to different factors .    in the particle diagram",
    "each of these factors @xmath74 is represented by a square as in fig .",
    "[ fig : square ] , and in this square one bond @xmath123 and one bond @xmath124 are attached to @xmath188 .",
    "the single - particle state @xmath187 is included in exactly one of these bonds . as this applies to both squares the state @xmath187",
    "is thus contained in a path that so far contains @xmath188 and two attached bonds belonging to different @xmath74 s .",
    "however now our reasoning can be continued as @xmath187 must also be contained in the many - particle states at the other end of each of the two bonds and then a further bond also attached to these states .",
    "this continues until all bonds included in the path form a closed loop .",
    "all loops in the particle diagram are permissible on condition that subsequent bonds along the loop belong to different @xmath74 s ( depicted in different colours in our figures ) .",
    "the shortest loops consist of two bonds that connect the same two nodes but belong to different @xmath74 s .",
    "the longest loops visit all nodes contained in the graph .    by the above argument each single - particle state contributing to one of the many - particle states belongs to a closed loop .",
    "in fact we can assume that it belongs to precisely one loop .",
    "it clearly can not belong to two different loops that intersect in some nodes  this would mean that for some states more than two of the attached bonds share single - particle states , which for fermionic states is ruled out .",
    "it would in principle be possible to have the same state included in two loops that visit disjoint sets of nodes .",
    "however this would decrease the number of participating single - particle states and hence the argument of the diagram .",
    "hence we can ignore this possibility in the limit @xmath79 .    now",
    "the most general method for evaluating particle diagrams is the following : first , determine all closed loops subject to the constraint above .",
    "our notation for a loop starting from the node @xmath189 and proceeding through @xmath190 before returning to @xmath189 will be @xmath191 ; as the loops are only used to describe overlaps between the bonds , loops with reverted ordering are considered identical .",
    "we introduce variables @xmath192 for the number of single - particle states participating in each loop .",
    "the sum @xmath193 gives the argument .",
    "then we incorporate the constraint that each bond @xmath124 contains @xmath1 states and each bond @xmath123 contains @xmath57 states .",
    "this constraint fixes the sum of the @xmath192 s belonging to all loops that contain a given bond , and thus leads to a system of linear equations for the @xmath192 s .",
    "if we solve this system of equations it yields all @xmath192 s , and therefore also the argument , as a linear function of a reduced number of parameters .",
    "these parameters have to be chosen in such a way that the argument is maximal and this optimal choice will often involve vanishing @xmath192",
    "s i.e. not all permitted loops have to contribute . if one obtains a unique choice for all @xmath192 s we have to consider all ways of selecting from the @xmath3 single particle states the required sets of @xmath192 states . the contribution of the diagram ( prior to normalization )",
    "is then given by @xmath194 if free parameters remain even after maximising the argument we obtain a sum over multinomials representing the remaining choices of @xmath192 .",
    "however in several of the cases to be considered there are shortcuts to the solution so that some of these steps are not needed .      the particle diagram @xmath195",

    "interestingly the motion at the bottom of the prism is determined by the motion on the top .",
    "for example a loop containing the bond @xmath200 can reach the node @xmath201 in the following step only through the bond @xmath202 as the bond @xmath203 belongs to the same factor @xmath74 as the preceding one .",
    "then the only possible choice for the next bond is @xmath204 .",
    "analogous reasoning holds for all sides , meaning that if a loop travelling along the top of the diagram moves down it is afterwards `` reflected '' and follows the image of the previous bonds on the bottom face .",
    "this leads to a number of further loops given by ( see e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : loopsprism]b and [ fig : loopsprism]c ) @xmath205 here the first half of the indices describes the motion on the top face and the second half describes the motion in the opposite direction at the bottom .",
    "finally there are loops travelling only on the top face ( @xmath206 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : loopsprism]d ) or only on the bottom face ( @xmath207 ) . the constraints for the division of states among loops",
    "can be solved consistently only if the numbers of states in the two final loops coincide .",
    "this follows from the fact that all other loops visit the top and bottom face symmetrically , and all other bonds have the same symmetry .",
    "the number of states included in each of the final two loops will be denoted by @xmath208 .",
    "now we have to incorporate the constraint that every bond @xmath123 contains @xmath57 states and every bond @xmath124 contains @xmath1 states .",
    "this fixes the sum of the numbers of states included in the loops traversing each bond .",
    "for the bonds on the top face of the prism this leads to the three equations @xmath209 the equations arising from the bonds on the bottom are identical to these and hence do not give further information .",
    "the equations arising from the six bonds on the sides are @xmath210 the argument is simply the total number of states participating in all loops , @xmath211 , including @xmath208 twice as there are two loops with this number of states .",
    "solving the system of equations provided by ( [ sys1 ] ) and ( [ sys2 ] ) allows one to express six of the loop numbers as linear functions of the others .",
    "summation then leads to the argument as a function of the remaining variables .",
    "if we include @xmath208 among the variables that are not eliminated the result for the argument is @xmath212 .",
    "hence we can maximise the argument by choosing @xmath213 which is the largest possible value for @xmath208 as the corresponding loop contains the bond @xmath214 with @xmath1 states .",
    "this result implies that all other loops containing the bond @xmath214 ( and appearing in the first line of ( [ sys1 ] ) ) must be empty , i.e. , @xmath215 with @xmath214 ( and analogously @xmath216 ) accounted for , the only way to incorporate the bond @xmath203 in a loop is to combine it with @xmath202 to form @xmath217 .",
    "this loop must therefore contain all @xmath1 states of @xmath203 leading to @xmath218 an analogous argument gives @xmath219 if we insert these results into the system of equations above it reduces to @xmath220 where the final two equations fix the number of states associated to the two bonds @xmath221 .",
    "having three equations for four unknowns we could now parametrise the solutions by one variable , express the result as a sum over multinomials depending on this variable , and then simplify the sum .",
    "however the form of the equation allows us to evaluate the diagram more quickly .",
    "we have to consider all ways to select from altogether @xmath3 single - particle states four loops with @xmath1 states each ( along the sides of the top and bottom face , and the two loops @xmath217 and @xmath222 ) and @xmath57 states that according to the first line of ( [ sysred ] ) have to be distributed among the loops @xmath223 , @xmath224 , @xmath225 , and @xmath226 .",
    "this leads to a factor @xmath227 . then , given the second line of ( [ sysred ] ) we have to select @xmath1 of the @xmath57 states in @xmath223 , @xmath224 , @xmath225 , and @xmath226 to be included in @xmath223 and @xmath225 .",

    "these two selections uniquely determine how the final @xmath57 single - particle states are distributed among the four loops in question , i.e. states selected twice are included in @xmath223 and states omitted from both selections are included in @xmath226 .",
    "altogether we thus obtain @xmath229 and , after normalization ( see ( [ multi2 ] ) ) , @xmath230      the only remaining particle diagram contributing to the sixth moment is @xmath231 , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : diamond ] . in this case",
    "there is a convenient shortcut that will allow us to find the optimal numbers of states participating in the loops .",
    "the key to this shortcut is that each participating single - particle state must be included in either @xmath232 or @xmath233 or both . to understand",
    "this we recall that for each quadrangle of many - particle states representing one of the factors @xmath74 , the union of two diametrically opposed states coincides with the union of the two other states . applying this to the blue quadrangles we see that @xmath201 and @xmath234 contain only states included in the union of @xmath232 and @xmath233 . considering the red quadrangle gives the same result for @xmath188 and @xmath235 . to maximise the number of participating single - particle states we thus have to make @xmath233 and @xmath232 as distinct as possible .",
    "this means that we should include as many single - particle states as possible in loops that contain only one of these nodes .",
    "there are four loops containing only @xmath232 , @xmath236 and four loops containing only @xmath233 , @xmath237 assuming that @xmath238 , the number of states in these loops can be maximised if we include the maximum permissible number of @xmath1 states in the first three loops in each group , leaving the final loops @xmath239 and @xmath240 empty .",
    "this choice is optimal because the omitted loops each involve only bonds @xmath124 that contain @xmath1 states that are each shared with one other loop from the same group . hence including one state in , say",
    ", @xmath239 would reduce the maximal number of states that can be included in @xmath241 , @xmath242 , and @xmath243 by one each . choosing @xmath1 states for the first three loops in each of the two groups",

    "all bonds @xmath123 contain @xmath57 single - particle states and participate in two of the loops with @xmath1 states each , leaving @xmath244 states undetermined .",
    "as the bonds @xmath123 together form one single loop @xmath245 the number of states included in this loop must also be @xmath244 .    to evaluate the present diagram we thus have to consider all ways to select from @xmath3 states six loops of @xmath1 states and one loop of @xmath244 states implying @xmath246 using ( [ multi2 ] ) this leads to @xmath247 we still have to check our result also holds in the case @xmath248 .",
    "we use that the argument of @xmath231 is the overall number of states in @xmath232 and @xmath233 , i.e. , it is smaller or equal to @xmath249 . for @xmath248",
