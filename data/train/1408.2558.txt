    "the rate of discovery of new types of low mass stellar systems over the last 15 years has been remarkable .",
    "these new systems include extended clusters ( ecs ) , faint fuzzies ( ffs ) , diffuse star clusters ( dscs ) and ultra compact dwarfs ( ucds ) .",
    "the latter have sizes and/or masses that approach those of dwarf ellipticals ( des ) and compact ellipticals ( ces ) .",
    "this discovery process usually begins with imaging that identifies candidates with _ inferred _ properties of size and luminosity that occupy a previously empty , or sparse , region of size - luminosity parameter space .",
    "the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , with its ability to partially resolve objects of size greater than 3 pc out to 40 mpc distance , has played a key role .",
    "the next step is spectroscopic confirmation that the object is indeed associated with a larger host galaxy / group and is not merely a background object seen in projection .",
    "the scaling relation between physical size and luminosity of confirmed objects can then be examined , with the caveat that selection bias needs to be understood .",
    "a further fundamental parameter of galaxies and star clusters alike is their internal velocity dispersion . measuring this",
    "usually requires dedicated spectroscopic follow - up with a high resolution spectrograph and long exposure times .",
    "as well as probing the velocity dispersion - luminosity scaling relation ( i.e. extending the faber - jackson relation into the low mass regime ) , one can calculate dynamical mass and contrast it with stellar mass estimates to gain insight on issues such as the dark matter content and/or the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "after a few individual objects have been studied in this way , larger , and statistically - complete , samples of objects can eventually be examined .",
    "as recently as 2007/8 , the number of known ces was only half a dozen ( chilingarian et al .",
    "2007 ) and ucds numbered around two dozen ( mieske et al . 2008 ; dabringhausen et al . 2008",
    "; forbes et al .",
    "2008 ) with a largely empty gap in the parameter space of size - luminosity - velocity dispersion between them .",
    "this gap has been filled over the years ( e.g. chiboucas et al .",
    "2011 ; brodie et al .",
    "2011 ; forbes et al . 2013 ) , but velocity dispersions for objects within the gap have not kept pace as they tend to be observed individually or in small numbers ( chilingarian & mamon 2008 ; price et al .",
    "2009 ; forbes et al . 2011 ; penny et al . 2014 ) .",
    "most recently , norris et al .",
    "( 2014 ; n14 ) has identified a number of ucd and ce candidates from hst archive imaging with a variety of telescopes used to confirm their distances .",
    "velocity dispersions have been measured for over two dozen of them .",
    "combining with the literature , a large number of confirmed objects now exist which fill the gap in velocity dispersion - luminosity parameter space between previously known ucds and ces .",
    "in n14 we found many new objects to have lower stellar masses for a given velocity dispersion compared to des and normal elliptical galaxies .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with ucds and ces being the tidally - stripped remnants of des and ellipticals , respectively ( bekki et al .",
    "2003 ; goerdt et al .",
    "2008 ; pfeffer & baumgardt 2013 ; faber 1973 ; bender , burstein & faber 1992 ; huxor et al .",
    "for example , the simulations of pfeffer & baumgardt ( 2013 ) placed a nucleated de galaxy on various orbits in a virgo cluster - like potential .",
    "after tidal stripping of the stars ( there is no dark matter in their model ) the final remnants have sizes and luminosities similar to those of observed ucds and in some cases the remnants are so small that they resemble bright gcs ( i.e. size @xmath4 5 pc and m@xmath6 @xmath4 9.5 ) .",
    "unfortunately they did not predict velocity dispersions .",
    "the objects discovered by n14 came from a range of environments including the field which is dominated by late type galaxies .",
    "thus the progenitors of ucds likely include disk galaxies with nuclei and/or bulges .    in n14",
    "we also found evidence to support the idea of a gradual transition from in - situ formed old star clusters ( globular clusters ) to free - floating remnant nuclei or bulges , as one probes masses from 10@xmath7 m@xmath2 to 10@xmath3 m@xmath2 .",
    "ucds in the mass range 10@xmath0 7 @xmath8 10@xmath5 m@xmath2 include both origins , but for masses @xmath9 m@xmath2 they are predominately remnants of stripped galaxies .",
    "we note that the transition is not only one of mass but also of size ( brodie et al .",
    "2011 ; forbes et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "previous observations of ucds suggest that they have elevated dynamical - to - stellar mass ratios , and the ratio increases with object mass ( e.g. mieske et al . 2013 and references therein ) .",
    "possible explanations , which may all be a consequence of an origin in tidal stripping , include the presence of central black holes , stars with a non - universal imf and dark matter .",
    "central massive black holes are now known to be a common occurrence in large galaxies .",
    "recently , mieske et al . (",
    "2013 ) concluded that central black holes with a mass some 10 - 15 per cent of the current ucd mass could explain the elevated ratios .",
    "this is consistent with ucds being the stripped remnants of @xmath410@xmath1 m@xmath2 galaxy progenitors , based on the black hole ",
    "galaxy scaling relation .",
    "the possibility of a different imf in ucds compared to globular clusters , with either bottom - heavy or top - heavy variants , has been suggested ( mieske et al .",
    "recent support for a bottom - heavy imf ( more low mass stars ) comes indirectly from observations of the cores of giant ellipticals ( e.g. van dokkum & conroy 2010 ) . in favour of a top - heavy imf ( more stellar remnants ) ,",
    "dabringhausen et al . (",
    "2012 ) recently showed that ucds have low mass x - ray binary rates up to ten times those expected for a globular cluster - like imf ( but see also phillips et al .",
    "2013 for an alternative conclusion ) .",
    "if tidal stripping has removed most of the initial galaxy s mass then the remnant will have a stellar population similar to that of the progenitor galaxy core .",
    "if this is the case , then the assumption of the same imf for all ucds gives a relatively lower stellar mass for the higher luminosity ucds , thus effectively raising their apparent dynamical - to - stellar mass ratio .",
    "murray ( 2009 ) and tollerud et al . (",
    "2011 ) have argued that if ucds formed with a nfw - like dark matter profile ( navarro , frenk & white 1997 ) then the expected dark matter density in the central regions would be some hundred times less than that observed for the stellar density , making dark matter relatively unimportant and unlikely to be the cause of the elevated ratios .",
    "furthermore , baumgardt & mieske ( 2008 ) showed that any dark matter can be effectively ` pushed out ' of a globular cluster even if it was present at formation .",
    "however , if ucds formed from the tidal stripping of a larger galaxy , then the remnant ucd may still contain some of the progenitor s dark matter .",
    "for example , in the simulations by goerdt et al .",
    "( 2008 ) of the tidal stripping of a nucleated dwarf disk galaxy , gas that falls into the remnant core can effectively drag dark matter from larger radii into the core region . in the case of a gas - free progenitor dwarf elliptical galaxy the central regions of the remnant ucd would be expected to remain relatively dark matter free ( forbes et al . 2011 ) .",
    "the search for dark matter in ucds has the best chance of success in those ucds with _ low _ stellar densities , i.e. low luminosity ucds with large sizes ( willman & strader 2012 ) ."
