    "it has been two decades since the twisted supersymmetry ( susy ) was first introduced @xcite . although the notion of twisted susy was originally proposed in the context of topological field theories @xcite , it has been recently paid much attention also from the lattice susy point of view @xcite . the main purpose of lattice susy is to provide a constructive formulation of supersymmetric models . to this end",
    "there have been a wide variety of studies addressing this subject @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it has long been recognized that there are a couple of obstacles in formulating lattice susy , such as the breakdown of leibniz rule and the existence of fermion doubling on the lattice .",
    "the twisted susy is providing a fundamental framework to overcome these difficulties . in the series of studies @xcite",
    ", we formulated the @xmath2 twisted wess - zumino type models , @xmath2 twisted super yang - mills ( sym ) and @xmath0 twisted sym on a lattice . starting from a careful observation of difference operators and supercharges , we introduced the notion of lattice leibniz rule conditions .",
    "we then explicitly showed that the dirac - khler twisted susy algebra can satisfy these conditions . as a result",
    ", we could realize all the supercharges and the invariance on the lattice by systematically introducing the link ( anti-)commutator algebra .",
    "it is crucial to observe that the importance of the twisted susy can be traced back to the intrinsic relation between twisted fermions and dirac - khler fermions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the very recent development in terms of the matrix formulation @xcite is serving as a fundamental framework realizing the above picture more rigidly .",
    "it is also interesting to mention that the above link approach of lattice susy and the so - called orbifold approach of lattice susy @xcite turn to be closely related each other , which was mentioned in the discussion in @xcite and also recently pointed out in @xcite .    keeping these circumstances in mind , in this paper",
    ", we describe a manifestly off - shell formulation of the @xmath0 twisted sym in the continuum flat spacetime which underlies our recent proposal of the @xmath0 twisted sym on the lattice .",
    "studies of the @xmath0 twisted sym in the continuum spacetime have been given in the past @xcite with the classification of two inequivalent topological twists which are called the super bf type ( a - type ) and the blau - thompson type ( b - type ) .",
    "the twisted sym multiplets and the algebra given in these studies are not entirely off - shell . in this paper , we explore these inequivalent twists entirely in a off - shell regime .",
    "we then show that the lattice sym multiplet given in @xcite is categorized as the b - type twist .",
    "we also investigate these two inequivalent twists from the lattice point of view and show that only the b - type multiplet can be realized on the lattice consistently with the leibniz rule and gauge covariance on the lattice .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , starting from the @xmath0 susy algebra , we introduce a twisted @xmath0 superspace formulation .",
    "we employ an extended susy superconnection method in order to provide a manifest gauge covariant off - shell framework . introducing the @xmath0 twisted sym constraints for the supercovariant derivatives , we construct a manifestly invariant formulation of @xmath0 twisted sym in the continuum spacetime which underlies the recent proposal of twisted sym on a three dimensional lattice @xcite .",
    "we also discuss about the twisted susy exact relation between the super chern - simons and the sym completely in the off - shell regime , stressing that the existence of sub - algebra and sub - multiplet is responsible for the off - shell super chern - simons realization . in sec . 3 , by a dimensional reduction from the @xmath1 twisted sym",
    ", we explore the two possible twists of @xmath0 .",
    "we then show that the lattice formulation of sym given in @xcite is classified as the b - type twisted sym . in sec . 4 , after reviewing the notion of the lattice leibniz rule @xcite",
    ", we examine the possibilities of realizing the twisted @xmath1 , @xmath0 a - type and b - type sym on the lattice .",
    "we then explicitly show that only the b - type twisted sym can be consistent with the lattice leibniz rule and the gauge covariance on the lattice .",
    "namely , the formulation given in @xcite is the unique lattice realization of @xmath0 twisted sym satisfying these conditions .",
    "sec . 5 gives the summary and the discussions .",
    "in this section , employing a twisted superfield method with eight supercharges , we explicitly perform an off - shell construction of the @xmath0 twisted sym .",

    "there are several remarks in order .",
    "first , since in the constraints ( [ n=4d=3const1])-([n=4d=3const4 ] ) we introduced the scalar fields @xmath65 on the same footing as the gauge fields @xmath64 , one may wonder how these fields are transformed under the lorentz @xmath66 and the internal @xmath67 rotations .",
    "reminding that the fermionic covariant derivatives @xmath49 are transforming just like as @xmath68 in ( [ 3dsj1])-([3dsj4 ] ) , respectively , one finds from ( [ n=4d=3const1])-([n=4d=3const4 ] ) , @xmath69 & = & -\\frac{i}{2}\\epsilon_{\\mu\\nu\\rho}(\\d_{\\underline{\\rho}}+i\\phi^{(\\rho ) } ) -\\frac{i}{2}\\epsilon_{\\mu\\nu\\rho}(\\d_{\\underline{\\rho}}-i\\phi^{(\\rho ) } ) \\\\[2pt ] & = & -i\\epsilon_{\\mu\\nu\\rho } \\d_{\\underline{\\rho } } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from which it obeys , @xmath70 & = & -i\\epsilon_{\\mu\\nu\\rho}\\d_{\\underline{\\rho } } , \\hspace{30pt } [ j_{\\mu},\\phi^{(\\nu ) } ] \\",

    "-i\\epsilon_{\\mu\\nu\\rho}\\phi^{(\\rho ) } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which implies that the @xmath64 and @xmath65 are transforming as @xmath67 scalars and a vector , respectively .",
    "one can thus see that even though the @xmath65 are introduced on the same footing as the gauge fields @xmath64 , they are appropriately transforming as scalars of the original lorentz rotations .",
    "obviously , the sign difference in front of the @xmath60 in ( [ n=4d=3const1])-([n=4d=3const3 ] ) is responsible for these transformation properties .",
    "furthermore , one should notice that , after the twisting , both of @xmath64 and @xmath65 transform as vectors under the twisted rotational group @xmath14 , @xmath72 & = & -i\\epsilon_{\\mu\\nu\\rho}\\d_{\\underline{\\rho } } , \\hspace{30pt } [ j^{diag}_{\\mu},\\phi^{(\\nu ) } ] \\ = \\",

    "the second remark is regarding the hermiticity of the constraints ( [ n=4d=3const1])-([n=4d=3const4 ] ) .",
    "we impose the following hermitian conjugation properties on the fermionic covariant derivatives , @xmath74 which are consistent with the complex conjugation nature of the supercharges @xmath7 and @xmath75 in ( [ n=4d=3susyalgebra ] ) , @xmath76 .",
    "one could easily notice that , in order to be compatible with the constraints ( [ n=4d=3const1])-([n=4d=3const3 ] ) , the supergauge transformation @xmath77 in ( [ gauge_trans_nabla ] ) should be hermitian .",
    "correspondingly , one can take the @xmath64 and the scalars @xmath65 as the hermitian fields which transform under the gauge transformation as , @xmath78 where @xmath79 denotes the @xmath80 independent first component of the supergauge transformation @xmath77 satisfying @xmath81 .",
    "the third remark is that the constraints ( [ n=4d=3const1])-([n=4d=3const4 ] ) corresponds to the naive continuum limit of the @xmath0 lattice sym constraints recently proposed in @xcite , where the gauge fields @xmath64 are exponentiated together with the scalar fields @xmath65 such that they could represent the bosonic gauge link variables either of the forward or the backward type , @xmath82 where the subscripts indicate that they are located on links from @xmath83 to @xmath84 ( forward ) and @xmath83 to @xmath85 ( backward ) , respectively , for a generic site @xmath83 .",
    "as is also stressed in @xcite , the twisting is playing a fundamental role in realizing the supersymmetry on the lattice and it can be traced back to the intrinsic relation between the twisted fermions and the dirac - khler fermions @xcite . here",
    "we find the importance of the twisting in the bosonic sector as well .",
    "namely , the exponential forms in ( [ bosonic_link_variables ] ) can transform covariantly only under the twisted rotational group @xmath14 and not under the @xmath66 and @xmath67 independently .",
    "we will come back to this point once again in sec . [ lattice_realization_other_types ] .",
    "once we impose the constraints ( [ n=4d=3const1])-([n=4d=3const4 ] ) , the whole information of the resulting @xmath0 twisted sym multiplet can be obtained by analyzing the jacobi identities together with the constraints ( [ n=4d=3const1])-([n=4d=3const4 ] ) . for the notational simplicity , we re - write the constraints ( [ n=4d=3const1])-([n=4d=3const4 ] ) as @xmath86 \\{\\d_{\\mu},\\overline{\\d}_{\\nu}\\ } & = &   -\\epsilon_{\\mu\\nu\\rho}\\d_{-\\rho } ,   \\label{n=4d=3const2r}\\\\[2pt ] \\{\\overline{\\d},{\\d}_{\\mu}\\ } & = & -i\\d_{+\\mu } ,   \\label{n=4d=3const3r}\\\\[2pt ] \\{others\\ } & = & 0.\\label{n=4d=3const4r}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the symbols @xmath87 are defined by @xmath88 & = & \\partial_{\\mu}-i(a_{\\mu}\\pm \\phi^{(\\mu ) } ) + \\cdots , \\\\[2pt ] & = & \\dc_{\\pm\\mu } + \\cdots,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we denote the @xmath80 independent part of @xmath87 as @xmath89 . since the @xmath0 sym constraints ( [ n=4d=3const1r])-([n=4d=3const4r ] ) are formally similar to the lattice sym constraints in @xcite , the jacobi identity analysis also goes parallel to the lattice analysis . of this paper . ]",

    "we first remind that , in the manifestly gauge covariant formulation of the lattice sym @xcite , each supercharge @xmath113 is replaced by the corresponding fermionic gauge link variable @xmath114 whose gauge variation is given by @xmath115 where @xmath116 denotes the finite gauge transformation at the site @xmath83 . in order for the sym multiplet to be realized on the lattice , we need to take care of not only the leibniz rule itself but also the lattice gauge covariance of the entire sym multiplet as well . although there is no distinction between the a - type and the b - type in the lattice realizations of the susy algebra itself ( [ 3dalg_lat ] ) except for interchanging the roles of the @xmath117 and the @xmath118 , the situation becomes quite different when one comes to the gauge covariance on the lattice .    for the b - type twisted sym which is subject to the constraints ( [ n=4d=3constb1 ] ) and ( [ n=4d=3constb2 ] )",
    ", we can successfully introduce the bosonic gauge link variables , @xmath119 , as the lattice realization of the gauge covariant derivatives , @xmath120 @xcite .",
    "note that the scalar fields @xmath65 , transforming as a three dimensional vector after the twisting , are embedded in the bosonic gauge link variables @xmath121 . in terms of these link variables ,",
    "the lattice counterpart of the constraints ( [ n=4d=3constb1 ] ) and ( [ n=4d=3constb2 ] ) can be expressed as @xmath122 \\{others\\ } & = & 0 ,   \\label{n=4d=3const_latb3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the anti - commutators in the l.h.s .",
    "are defined as the link anti - commutators as in the supercharge case ( [ link_anti - comm ] ) , @xmath123 notice that the leibniz rule conditions ( [ 3dleibniz_cond ] ) are nothing but the gauge covariance conditions for the b - type twisted sym constraints ( [ n=4d=3const_latb1 ] ) and ( [ n=4d=3const_latb2 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , once the starting constraints are given in a gauge covariant manner , all the analyses of the jacobi identities automatically respect the gauge covariance on the lattice thanks to the link definition of the ( anti-)commutators . in this way",
    ", the gauge covariance for the b - type twisted sym is manifestly maintained on the lattice .",
    "in order to maintain the gauge covariance associated with the twisted susy variations of the component fields on the lattice . ]    as for the a - type twisted multiplet in contrast , one finds that the scalar fields @xmath124 are embedded in the constraints ( [ n=4d=3consta1 ] ) and ( [ n=4d=3consta2 ] ) as follows , @xmath125 this  diagonal \" embedding of the scalar fields is directly related the fact that the @xmath124 are transforming as scalars under @xmath14 even after the twisting ( see ( [ a - type_a_phi ] ) ) .",
    "the crucial observation here is that the equalities in ( [ phi_const ] ) can never be simultaneously satisfied on the lattice since the solutions for the lattice leibniz rule ( [ solution1])-([solution2 ] ) indicate that each anti - commutator should be located on a different link each other .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath126 we have the four anti - commutators obviously located on different links each other , @xmath127 likewise , we do not have any chance to simultaneously satisfy the equalities in ( [ phi_const ] ) in the case of @xmath128 , either .",
    "thus , the scalar fields @xmath124 in the a - type twisted multiplet can never be located on any definite links on the three dimensional lattice .",
    "we conclude that , amongst two types of the @xmath0 twisted sym , only the b - type twisted multiplet can be realized on the lattice keeping the leibniz rule and the gauge covariance on the lattice .",
    "namely , the formulation given in @xcite is the unique lattice realization of @xmath0 twisted sym satisfying these criteria .",
    "one may wonder why the a - type multiplet fails on the lattice even though the starting constraints for the a - type ( [ n=4d=3consta1])-([n=4d=3consta2 ] ) and the b - type ( [ n=4d=3constb1])-([n=4d=3constb2 ] ) are related each other by the linear combinations ( [ recombi1])-([recombi4 ] ) .",
    "one should remind here that although the a - type and b - type basis are related each other , those two give rise to the inequivalent theories after the twisting since they respect the different diagonal subgroups of the lorentz and the internal rotations .",
    "the above analysis suggests that only the b - type twisted rotational subgroup can be survived on the three dimensional lattice consistently with the gauge covariance of the lattice susy multiplet .",
    "it should be mentioned here that we had a similar situation also in the twisted @xmath2 .",
    "the existense of two inequivalent twists in the @xmath2 sym is originated from the two inequivalent internal symmetries , the ghost number @xmath129 and the @xmath130 internal rotation . in the lattice formulation proposed in @xcite",
    ", we introduced the scalar fields in such a way that they transform as a two dimensional vector after the twisting .",
    "we could maintain the gauge covariance of the @xmath2 twisted sym multiplet on the lattice by embedding the gauge fields and the scalar fields in the bosonic gauge link variables just as in the b - type twist of @xmath0 explained above .",
    "the other twisted basis of @xmath2 turned out not to accommodate the lattice gauge covariance just as in the case of the a - type twisted @xmath0 . the lattice formulation given in @xcite is thus providing the unique lattice realization of @xmath2 twisted sym compatible with the lattice leibniz rule and the gauge covariance on the lattice .",
    "an entirely off - shell formulation of the @xmath0 twisted sym is presented .",
    "we employ the twisted superconnection method in order to provide an manifestly gauge covariant off - shell framework .",
    "although the formulation is given in terms of the twisted basis , the resulting sym action respects the entire symmetry group of the three dimensional lorentz rotations @xmath131 and the internal rotations @xmath117 in the flat spacetime .",
    "we also explore the two inequivalent twisted sym of @xmath0 rather explicitly and we then show that the recent proposal of @xmath0 twisted sym on the lattice @xcite is essentially classified as the b - type twisted sym .",
    "we also consider the possibility of realizing the @xmath1 twisted sym as well as the @xmath0 a - type twisted sym on the lattice by analyzing the lattice leibniz rule and the gauge covariance on the lattice .",
    "we then show that the @xmath1 twisted susy algebra can not satisfy the leibniz rule conditions on the four dimensional lattice and that the a - type twisted sym multiplet can not be compatible with the gauge covariance on the three dimensional lattice .",
    "the analyses show that the lattice formulation given in @xcite is the unique realization of @xmath0 twisted sym on the lattice satisfying these criteria . in the same respect",
    ", we also mentioned that the two dimensional lattice sym formulation given in @xcite is providing the unique formulation of @xmath2 twisted sym on the lattice .    in this paper , we also explicitly derive the twisted susy exact relation between @xmath0 twisted sym and the super chern - simons entirely in the off - shell regime .",
    "thanks to the off - shell structure , we clarify the twisted susy invariant nature of these super chern - simons actions .",
    "we point out that the existence of the sub - algebra and the sub - multiplet in the @xmath0 is responsible for the twisted susy invariance .",
    "we observe that these relations are also playing important roles when studying a possible formulation of the super chern - simons on the lattice .",
    "the result of this analysis will be given elsewhere .",
