    "the accelerator properties of lhec have been summarized .",
    "finally , the generator level results of pdf distributions with @xmath1 and @xmath0 pair production obtained using comphep are analyzed in section 4 .",
    "in the @xmath2 option of the lhec one can consider two cases : firstly e - beam energy with @xmath7 gev ( lhec type-1 ) and second @xmath8 gev ( lhec type-2 ) . on the other hand , in another version of the @xmath2 collider , the beam energies can be extended to @xmath14 gev ( and/or @xmath15 gev ) .",

    "furthermore this figure shows two groups of curves for the larger @xmath21 values : the differential cross sections of first group are around at @xmath22 @xmath23 and second at @xmath24 @xmath23 .    in fig .",

    "the difference can be reduced by taken into account unimplemented corrections because total cross section of dis is not simple finite function of @xmath35 , those unimplemented corrections will be searched as a next publication . as a result of calculations done",
