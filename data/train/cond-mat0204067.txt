    "<S> the pump is optimal if the heat current equals to the power of joule heat@xcite . as a result , the optimal pump is noiseless and charge transported is quantized . in a recent paper , moskalets and buttiker@xcite </S>",
    "<S> have also considered the dissipation in an adiabatic quantum pump . the heat current and the noise has been formulated in terms of a parametric emissivity matrix . </S>",
    "<S> the theory of moskalets and buttiker is in the weak pumping regime ( quadratic order in pumping amplitude ) and can go to the finite frequency if one goes beyond the hypothesis of instant scattering . in this paper </S>",

    "<S> recently there is a concern of whether a genuine optimal pump with nonvanishing transmission coefficient exists@xcite . in this paper , we give a nontrivial example of optimal pump . by comparing the pumped heat current and the power of joule heat generated in the system , we found that the double barrier structure is an optimal pump in the strong pumping regime .    </S>",
    "<S> we start with the general definition for the heat current in scattering matrix theory@xcite ,    @xmath0    where the heat current operator is @xmath1 and @xmath2 denotes the quantum average . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 is the energy current operator given by @xmath4 \\label{heat1}\\ ] ] and @xmath5 is the electric current operator , @xmath6 where the operators @xmath7 and @xmath8 are annihilation operators for the outgoing and incoming carriers in the lead @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> they are related by the scattering matrix ,    @xmath10    where the time - dependence of the scattering matrix is due to the slowly time - varying pumping potential @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution function can be obtained by taking the quantum average,@xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the fourier transform of @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the fermi distribution function . for the purpose of presentation </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the energy current first and the electric current can be calculated in a similar fashion . from eqs.([heat1 ] ) , ( [ bb ] ) , and ( [ fermi ] ) , the energy current is given by    @xmath16    where @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> now we will focus on the first term ( denoted as @xmath18 ) in eq.([heat2 ] ) . after changing of the variable @xmath19 and @xmath20 and using the following wigner transform for the scattering matrix@xcite ,    @xmath21    eq.([heat2 ] ) becomes ,    @xmath22 \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    </S>",

    "<S> the heat current is given by @xmath32 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\sum_\\beta \\partial_t s_{\\alpha \\beta}(e , t )   \\partial_t s^\\dagger_{\\alpha \\beta}(e , t ) \\nonumber \\\\ & - & \\frac{1}{2\\pi t_p}\\int^{t_p}_0 dt   \\int de ( e - e_f ) \\partial_e f \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\sum_\\beta { \\rm </S>",
    "<S> i m } [ \\partial_t s^\\dagger_{\\alpha \\beta}(e , t )   s_{\\alpha \\beta}(e , t ) ]   \\label{final}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the second term in eq.([final ] ) vanishes at zero temperature . in the adiabatic regime </S>",
    "<S> , we have@xcite @xmath33 $ ] where @xmath34 . up to the order @xmath27 </S>",
    "<S> , we can neglect the contribution from @xmath35 . at zero temperature , eq.([final ] ) becomes ,    @xmath36    it is straightforward to obtain the heat current at higher order in frequency . to do that </S>",
    "<S> , we have to keep the higher order term in the expansion of @xmath29 in eq.([i1 ] ) and include the contribution of higher order derivatives@xcite such as @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , expanding eq.([i1 ] ) to the third order in @xmath29 and including the contribution from the electric current , we obtain ( up to @xmath38 ) ,    @xmath39 \\label{final2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    there are also third order corrections from eq.([final ] ) where the term @xmath35 should be kept . </S>",
    "<S> we now consider the limiting case of eq.([final1 ] ) when the pumping amplitude is small . for two probe pumping : @xmath40 and @xmath41 , we see that the lowest order pumping amplitude in eq.([final1 ] ) is quadratic by neglecting @xmath42 dependence in @xmath43 . in this case , it is straightforward to show that eq.([final1 ] ) is reduced to    @xmath44 \\label{weak}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    which agrees@xcite with the result of ref ..    we now apply our formula eq.([final1 ] ) to a one - dimensional quantum structure which modeled by double barrier potential @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the well width . for this system the green s function @xmath47 can be calculated exactly@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> with @xmath47 we can calculate scattering matrix from the fisher - lee relation@xcite @xmath48 , with @xmath49 the electron velocity in the lead . the adiabatic pump that we consider is operated by changing barrier heights adiabatically and periodically : @xmath50 and @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be achieved by microfabricating metallic gates at the barrier region and applying a time dependent gate potential . </S>",
    "<S> since the pumped current is proportional to @xmath27 , we will set @xmath52 for convenience . </S>",
    "<S> finally the unit is set by @xmath53@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we first study the pumped heat current with two pumping potentials . </S>",
    "<S> fig.1 depicts the pumped heat current exiting from left lead versus fermi energy for the symmetric barriers at small pumping amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> we have also plotted the transmission coefficient ( solid line ) versus fermi energy for comparison . </S>",
    "<S> the physical picture of heat flow suggested by moskalets and buttiker@xcite is the following : as electron scattered by the oscillating barriers or scatterers , the absorption of energy quantum @xmath54 creates an electron - hole pair . </S>",
    "<S> the flow of electron - hole pair leads to the heat transfer . in the symmetric case , we have @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the heat current is peaked at the resonant levels and is clearly proportional to the density of states of the scattering region . at phase difference @xmath56 ( short - dashed line ) , </S>",
    "<S> the lineshape of @xmath57 is approximately lorentzian similar to that of transmission coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath58 decreases , the lineshape is broadened and deviates from lorentzian considerably . for large pumping amplitude ( see inset of fig.1 ) , we see that there is significant heat current even in the off resonant case ( when fermi enegy is not in line with the resonant level in the static case when pumping potential is off ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is because in the strong pumping regime , the instantaneous resonant level oscillates with a large amplitude and hence can generate heat current in a broad range of energy . </S>",
    "<S> up to the order of @xmath27 , the heat currents @xmath59 and @xmath60 are all positive and flow from the scatterers to the reservoir . </S>",
    "<S> it is no longer true when high order frequency contribution is included . </S>",
    "<S> fig.2 shows the heat current as a function of phase difference for different pumping amplitudes . in general </S>",
    "<S> , there are two extreme points for the heat current at @xmath61 and @xmath62 , where the former corresponds to maximum in heat current and latter for the minimum . in the weak pumping regime , </S>",
    "<S> the sinusoidal behavior is seen . in the strong pumping regime , however , we see significant derivation from the sinusoidal behavior . as a result , when increasing @xmath58 from @xmath61 to @xmath63 , the heat current drops not as fast as in the weak pumping regime away from @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> however , near @xmath62 , the heat current decreases much faster . </S>",
    "<S> fig.3 displays the heat current as a function of pumping amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> the general behaviors of heat current at different @xmath58 are similar . </S>",
    "<S> we see that initially , the heat current increases quadratically with pumping amplitude in the weak pumping regime and then quickly approaches to the linear regime in the strong pumping regime . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior persists for single pumping potential . in the inset , </S>",
    "<S> we present the result for asymmetric barriers . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 , @xmath59 is about twice as large as @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> this is reasonable because it is easier for heat current to tunnel through the lower barrier . in general , the electric pumped current is linear in frequency for two pumping potentials whereas for single pumping potential , it must be zero up to the first order in frequency@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the heat current is different . for both single pump and two potential pump , </S>",
    "<S> the heat currents are of order @xmath27 . in the weak pumping limit </S>",
    "<S> , there is a simple relationship between the following three heat currents@xcite : @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> where @xmath68 is the heat current of two pumping potentials with phase difference @xmath69 , @xmath70 is the heat current of single pump due to the left oscillating barrier , and @xmath71 heat current due to the right barrier . in the strong pumping regime , </S>",
    "<S> the scattering matrix depends on both @xmath72 and @xmath73 in a nonlinear fashion , this simple relation is no longer valid . </S>",
    "<S> denoting the ratio @xmath74 , we found that at small pumping amplitude , @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> as one increases the pumping amplitude the ratio @xmath29 decreases and quickly saturates around @xmath76 . this is understandable since the behavior of @xmath68 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 are similar as one increases the pumping amplitude , one obtains the nearly constant ratio in the linear pumping amplitude dependence regime ( see fig.3 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we study the dissipation of the pump by comparing the heat current and the power of joule heat produced by the electric current@xcite . we found that the heat current is always larger than the corresponding power of joule heat as predicted by ref .. in fig.4 , we plot the pumped charge per cycle and the ratio between the power of joule heat and the heat current as a function of pumping amplitude @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the pumped charge increases as @xmath77 increases . in the large @xmath77 limit </S>",
    "<S> , the pumped charge will eventually reach the maximum value @xmath78@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we see from fig.4 that the ratio also approaches to one just like the pumped charge . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we conclude that the double barrier pump we studied can be optimal in very strong pumping limit .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have developed a general theory for the pumped heat current at finite pumping amplitude and frequency which allows us to investigate the pumped heat current in both weak and strong pumping regimes as different system parameters vary . </S>",
    "<S> as the pumping amplitude varies , we observed the crossover of pumped heat current from quadratic dependence in the weak pumping regime to linear dependence in the strong pumping regime . in the strong pumping regime , </S>",
    "<S> the pumped heat current shows strong nonlineality as a function of phase difference between two pumping potentials . </S>",
    "<S> for the single pump , we found that amplitude of pumped heat current is of the same order as that of two pumping potentials . </S>",
    "<S> finally , our numerical results show that the double barrier structure we examined can be an optimal pump in the strong pumping regime . </S>"
