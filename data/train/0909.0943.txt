    "the observed properties of @xmath1 proto - elliptical galaxies are hard to reconcile with some currently proposed ( idealized ) schemes for the formation of elliptical galaxies : the observations indicate that most early - type galaxies did not form in a simple monolithic collapse or a binary merger of gas - rich disks at high redshift , unless their increase in size is due to subsequent considerable ( and unlikely ) amounts of mass loss @xcite . moreover , simple passive evolution of the stellar populations is in contradiction with observations of local ellipticals @xcite .",
    "dry ( i.e. gas - poor , collisionless ) minor mergers and stellar accretion events are the prime candidates for the strong size evolution of massive stellar spheroids at @xmath21 @xcite as the additional presence of a dissipative component in a major merger event would limit the size increase ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the observed ellipticals are already very massive at high redshift , thus we expect , e.g , . from the shape of the mass function , that minor mergers should be much more common than major mergers until @xmath22 @xcite + the compact @xmath1 galaxies observed by , e.g. , @xcite are very massive , with stellar masses of up to @xmath23 . moreover , in the one case where the stellar line - of - sight velocity dispersion has been measured , this is also very large , @xmath13 km / s ( galaxy 1255 - 0 ; @xcite ) . from a theoretical / numerical point of view , an obvious question is whether @xmath1 galaxies of such extreme characteristics can be reproduced by current cosmological state - of - the - art galaxy formation simulations . in a recent work",

    "we shall hence conservatively denote the mass range @xmath0 , at @xmath4 , the definitely well resolved mass range .    to assess , more quantitatively , the effects of mass resolution and two - body relaxation , we carried out simulations of an individual proto - elliptical galaxy region at much higher mass resolution than used in the proto - cluster simulations ( cf .",
    "table  [ tab : data ] ) .",
    "the main elliptical galaxy formed has a final @xmath22 stellar mass of about @xmath149 , and resides in a `` field '' galaxy region @xcite . at @xmath1 the region",
    "contains 5 galaxies of stellar mass @xmath150 . using eq.[11 ]",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath151 and @xmath152 for simulations `` e4 '' and `` e4hr '' , respectively , where @xmath153 is the present age of the universe . in figures 1 - 3",
    "are shown @xmath84 , @xmath94 and @xmath107 for these five proto - galaxies at @xmath4 . moreover , at @xmath22 , the simulation contains three galaxies of @xmath154 .",
    "the values of @xmath107 for these three galaxies are also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhostar ] . as can be seen from the figures , the @xmath1 high - resolution proto - elliptical results are broadly consistent with the high force resolution proto - cluster results .",
    "this may indicate that the latter results are not severely affected by two - body relaxation effects  but see below . on the other hand ,",
    "the discrepancy between the @xmath22 elliptical galaxy and cluster results could indicate that the latter , at @xmath111 , are affected by relaxation effects .",
    "however , there is no fundamental reason why elliptical galaxies in a `` field '' region and in a cluster regions should have identical properties .",
    "hence , in order to determine the characteristics of @xmath111 , @xmath30 cluster galaxies , simulations of higher mass resolution have to be undertaken - such simulations are in progress .    as proto - cluster regions are some of the first regions in which the growth of small density fluctuations goes non - linear , later causing re - collapse and galaxy formation , it is possible that the galaxies formed in the present simulations on average are even more compact than the limited number of galaxies observed so far - in fact , this is indicated by figs .",
    "[ fig : reffz2 ] and [ fig : rhostar ] .",
    "it is hence important to also simulate other , and perhaps more representative , regions of the universe as well .",
    "this will also be the topic of forthcoming work .    as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : axrat ] , the coma3 and e4hr galaxies satisfy @xmath155 .",
    "three of the nine galaxies observed and analyzed by @xcite are flatter than this , with @xmath156 .",
    "this hints at a real discrepancy , which is only aggravated when considering that the observed axial ratios are _ apparent _ , such that the observed galaxies may be intrinsically even flatter .",
    "the reason for the discrepancy is not clear  it may originate from comparing galaxies formed in different environments , but the discrepancy appears to pertain to both the proto - cluster and proto - elliptical ( `` field '' ) simulations .",
    "it may also stem from not comparing observations and simulations in a consistent way , or , finally , be caused by not including sufficient input physics in the simulations , in this way relating to the `` angular momentum problem '' ( e.g. , sommer - larsen et  al .",
    "2003 ) - work is in progress to address this issue as well .",
    "+ also , the e4hr galaxies appear flatter on average than the coma3 galaxies of the same stellar mass .",
    "this may be an environmental effect , but may also be due to the @xmath111 galaxies spuriously growing rounder with time due to effects of two - body relaxation , cf .",
    "the discussion above .    in our derivation of expected virial velocity dispersions ( eq.[2 ] )",
    ", we have assumed that the galactic mass inside of two effective radii is dominated by stellar mass . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mcum ] , we show the cumulative distribution of gas , stellar and dark matter mass for a massive ( @xmath157 ) , @xmath4 galaxy from the coma3 run . as can be seen ,",
    "the inner mass distribution is indeed dominated by the stellar mass , with the dark and stellar masses only becoming equal at @xmath158 .",
    "this is a general finding at @xmath4 : for the mass range for which the mass resolution is definitely sufficient , @xmath0 , the fraction of dark matter mass inside of @xmath159 is of the order 20% .    finally , it is clearly of interest , in relation to comparison to observations , to calculate surface brightness profiles for the simulated galaxies .",
    "a detailed analysis of this , invoking radially dependent mass - to - light ratios , will be presented in @xcite .",
    "motivated by recent observational findings , we investigate the structure and dynamics of high - mass ( @xmath0 ) @xmath1 galaxies . specifically , a number of cosmological hydrodynamical / n - body simulations of a @xmath2 mpc@xmath3 co - moving ( lagrangian ) , proto - cluster region have been undertaken . at @xmath4 ,",
    "the highest resolution simulation contains @xmath5 resolved galaxies , of which 27 have @xmath7 , and 5 have @xmath8 . + in addition , we ran a number of simulations , including one of ultra - high resolution , of a forming proto - elliptical galaxy .",
    "total stellar masses , effective radii and characteristic stellar densities have been determined for all galaxies . at @xmath4 , for the definitely well resolved ( proto - cluster ) mass range of @xmath0 , we find a relation of the form @xmath160  kpc , where @xmath10 is the total stellar mass in units of @xmath11 .",
    "this is in line with recent observational findings for very massive , compact @xmath1 galaxies , though somewhat _ more _",
    "compact than the observed average .",
    "the only line - of - sight velocity dispersion measured for a @xmath1 compact galaxy is very large , @xmath13 km / s @xcite",
    ". this value can be matched at about the 1-@xmath14 level , although a somewhat larger mass than the estimated @xmath15 is indicated .",
    "+ it is found that the massive compact galaxies are strongly baryon dominated in their inner parts , with typical dark matter mass fractions of order only 20% inside of @xmath19 .    to further study the kinematics and dynamics of the galaxies , we calculated axial ratios , rotation velocities and velocity dispersion tensors for these . for the above mass range ,",
    "the galaxies have an average axial ratio @xmath16 with a dispersion of 0.1 , and an average rotation to 1d velocity dispersion ratio @xmath17 with a dispersion of 0.3 , and a maximum value of @xmath18 .",
    "rotation and velocity anisotropy both contribute significantly in flattening the compact galaxies .",
    "some of the observed compact galaxies appear flatter than any of the simulated galaxies  additional work is required to understand the origin of this possible discrepancy .",
