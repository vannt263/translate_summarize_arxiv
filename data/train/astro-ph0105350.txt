    "it is apparent that _ the innermost regions of m3 have a much bluer hb than the outermost ones_. even though the inner regions were observed with hst - wfpc2 while the outermost regions were observed from the ground , we emphasize that the difference is real , extremely significant , and _ can not _ be accounted for by any conceivable source of systematic observational error .",

    "ignoring , for the sake of argument , the internal 2ndp in m3 and the difference in mass dispersion between the m3 and pal  3 hbs , we find , using an approach similar to catelan s ( 2000 ) , that the relative hb types of m3 and pal  3 can be easily accounted for by a difference in age of @xmath2  gyr ( fig .",
