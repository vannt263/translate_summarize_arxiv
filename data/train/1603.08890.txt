    "this quantity fluctuates due to random variation of the influence quantities during measurements or due to its intrinsic stochasticity .",
    "such a fluctuation can be quantified through the variance of the observations    @xmath6    this variance represents the variability of @xmath7 around its mean value @xmath8 .",
    "finally , the uncertainty associated to the input variable , which is the mean value of @xmath7 , can be estimated as    @xmath9    @xmath10 is a measure of the uncertainty of @xmath8 and quantifies how good @xmath8 estimates the real expectation value of @xmath7 , which is most of the time inaccessible to us .",

    "the dlc-200 tabulation departs the most from the xcom set . at 40 kev",
    ", there is an extreme underestimation of the absorbed dose at 1 cm from a point source determined with the dlc-200 set when compared to that obtained with the xcom compilation .",
    "this seems to be caused by a corresponding underestimation of the photoelectric cross section ( dlc-200.vs.xcom ) , which is of about 10% .",
    "below 10 kev , the ratio between the dlc-200 and xcom absorbed doses tends to diverge through an overestimation .",
    "a year later , bohm et al . @xcite benchmarked the mcnp / mcnpx mc code ( see ref . @xcite and references there in ) for the characterization of low energy brachytherapy sources ( also with @xmath15i and @xmath16pd ) .",
    "they carried out calculations using two cross section sets and reported on the consequent impact on the corresponding dose rate constants and radial dose functions . according to their results , differences of about 10% and 6% in the photoelectric and total cross sections in this energy range , respectively , lead to changes in the dose rate constant of 3% and 5% , and of 18% and 20% in the radial dose function for the @xmath15i and @xmath16pd sources , respectively .",
    "williamson and rivard @xcite carried out a more systematic work on uncertainty propagation when determining brachytherapy sources dosimetric parameters via monte carlo simulations .",
    "they proposed the following formula to account for systematic and statistical uncertainties of a given quantity ( y ) : @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the total attenuation coefficient , @xmath19 is a geometrical parameter and @xmath20 is the statistical uncertainty associated to the mc simulation .",
    "@xmath21 can be any of the interest quantities , such as the dose rate constant ( @xmath22 ) , the radial dose function ( @xmath23 ) , among others .",

    "@xcite studied the systematic uncertainties of ionization chamber quality correction factors ( @xmath26 ) determined by mc simulations .",
    "various uncertainty sources were investigated , including geometrical factors and interaction cross sections . for photons , they scaled the corresponding cross section whereas for electrons , the mean excitation energy was varied as it is the main source of uncertainty for stopping powers .",
    "this way , sensitivity factors were found and combined with the corresponding estimated uncertainty to know how cross section uncertainties propagate to @xmath26 . in a similar work , muir and rogers @xcite carried out a very detailed analysis on systematic uncertainty sources when determining the beam quality correction factors for ionization chambers ( k@xmath27 ) .",
    "they included items such as photon cross sections , electron stopping power , chamber dimensions , and photon spectra .",
    "recently , ali et al .",
    "@xcite used a very sophisticated statistical method to derive uncertainties of photon cross sections .",
    "this method was firstly applied to experimental and monte carlo simulated transmission factors for several megavoltage beams . secondly",
    ", the approach was directly applied to experimental and theoretical ( xcom+iaea set ) photon interaction cross sections . only graphite and lead materials were included in this study .",
    "unfortunately , this method was not sensitive enough to resolve the energy dependence of the uncertainties in question .",
    "thus , the authors reported energy - independent photon cross section uncertainties of 0.6% and 0.2% for graphite and lead , respectively ( 68% confidence ) , obtained from the comparison between experimental and simulated transmission curves .",
    "these uncertainties were 0.2% and 0.9% ( 68% confidence ) for graphite and lead , respectively , when the method was directly applied to experimental and theoretical cross sections . for practical reasons ,",
    "the authors recommend use an overall cs uncertainty of 0.5% ( 68% confidence ) for photons with energies from 100 kev up to 40 mev .",
    "the uncertainties reported by ali et al .",
    "@xcite are lower than those previously estimated by the seminal compilation of hubbell @xcite . according to this review",
    ", photoeffect cross section uncertainties can be estimated as 2% and 1%-2% ( 68% confidence ) for photons with energies of 5 kev-100 kev and 100 kev-10 mev , respectively .",
    "in addition , hubbell recommends an overall uncertainty for the total mass attenuation coefficient ( @xmath28 ) of the order of 1% to 2% ( 68% confidence ) for photon energies from 5 kev up to a few mev .",
    "one of the most important source of systematic uncertainty in mc simulations is interaction cross section . besides the approach followed by ali et al .",
    "@xcite , there are two other approaches for evaluating the impact of systematic uncertainties on a quantity determined by mc simulations .",
    "the first one could be letting the input quantity fluctuate during simulation according to a given distribution and the corresponding variance .",
    "namely , this quantity can be sampled during each mc step . a second simulation can be done by choosing the expected value of the same quantity , or its reference value , during each mc step . that is , not letting it fluctuate so the final result will only represent a pure statistical uncertainty .",
    "then , the two corresponding final uncertainties can be compared and the influence of the systematic uncertainty on the quantity in question can be deconvoluted .",
    "this method could be regarded as a statistical or type a evaluation of the uncertainty associated to a systematic effect .",
    "that is , the systematic effect of this quantity is converted into a random effect during its evaluation ( see @xmath293.3.3 of @xcite ) .",
    "the second one is simpler .",
    "the input quantity can be artificially scaled , let s say in @xmath305 % .",
    "a long enough mc simulation would give back a negligible statistic uncertainty , then the sensitivity factor @xmath31 can be determined .",
    "this factor can be used in conjunction with the known systematic uncertainty of @xmath7 to calculate the contribution of this variable to the quantity @xmath1 uncertainty .",
    "the latter approach was followed in this work .    a complete study of systematic uncertainties in mc simulations for the determination of absorbed dose distributions would involve several parameters , such as both differential and total interaction cross sections , material composition and density , geometrical factors , and so forth .",
    "the systematic study of electron cs must include all the transport parameters related to the history condensation algorithm .",
    "this algorithm and the associated controlling parameters are particular for each mc code .",
    "this could be the matter for another independent work .",
    "for these reasons , electron cs uncertainties were left out of the scope of this work . in this study , only the influence of total photon cross sections on the central depth dose distribution of a primary photon beam is investigated .",
    "this influence is quantified trough the determination of the dose - to - cs sensitivity factors .",
    "the methodology used in this work is able to account for energy dependency of the dose - to - cs sensitivity factors .",
    "that is , the impact of photon cs uncertainty on dose uncertainty can be energy - resolved .",

    "these ratios were obtained by scaling total and only compton cs . in this case ,",
    "a 20 kev pencil beam was simulated .",
    "the first important feature observed in this figure is that the gradient @xmath49 is positive for depths below a certain value , which will be from now on denoted as the equilibrium depth ( ed ) . above the ed , this gradient becomes negative . in other words ,",
    "the dose increases with the increment of cs at depths lower than the ed .",
    "however , this behavior is inverted for depths greater than the ed .",
    "this can be explained as follows .",
    "the mean free path ( @xmath51 ) of 20 kev photons in liquid water is about 1.24 cm ( determined from data found at ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which seems to be very close to the ed extracted from these results ( 1.3 cm ) .",
    "thus , @xmath51 would represent a pivot depth around which the depth dose curve turns on the dose - depth plane when cs are scaled . when cs are reduced ( @xmath52 ) , @xmath51 increases so photons become more penetrating , carrying out their energy towards greater depths .",
    "this is why the dose is reduced at depths lower than the ed ( @xmath53 ) and increased ( @xmath54 ) at depths higher than the ed .",
    "on the one hand , underestimation of cs leads to the decrease ( increase ) of the dose at lower ( greater ) depths . on the other hand , overestimation of cs",
    "leads to the increase ( decrease ) of the dose at lower ( greater ) depths .",
    "in addition , the impact of cs uncertainties on the dose uncertainty is negligible at the ed because @xmath55 .",
    "as the energy deposition process depends on the interplay between photon energy fluence ( @xmath56 ) and mass energy absorption coefficient ( @xmath57 ) at a given depth , the behavior discussed just above can be also explained analyzing these quantities .",
    "when total cs is reduced , @xmath57 decreases proportionally and the energy fluence at lower depths changes little which leads to a dose decrease .",
    "the diminution of cs makes the beam more penetrating , producing an increase of the fluence at greater depths . due to the exponential behavior of fluence as a function of the attenuation coefficient",
    ", this fluence should increase more than the fraction used to scale this coefficient ( or cs ) .",
    "then , the product @xmath58 ( dose ) at high depths tends to increase when scaling down cs . at the equilibrium depth",
    ", the decrease of @xmath57 is compensated by the fluence increase so the sensitivity factor is nearly zero .",
    "[ fig_20kev_a ] shows that the effect of scaling compton cs is relatively weak for this photon energy .",
    "it should be noticed that the curves corresponding to compton cs are collapsed around @xmath59 . however , scaling photo - electric cs ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_20kev_b ] ) has a stronger influence on the dose distribution when compared to that of the compton scattering .",
    "this is an expected behavior since compton scattering cs are lower than those for photo - electric effect in water below @xmath60 26 kev .",
    "in addition , there is a peculiar behavior in the sensitivity factor at 1 cm depth .",
    "the dose at this depth is more sensitive to the scaling of photo - electric cs than to the total cs .",
    "this suggests that the effect of cs scaling in photo - electric effect is opposite to that for compton and rayleigh scattering cs .",
    "this could be related to the trade - off between attenuation and scattering of the photon beam .",
    "[ fig_20kev_c ] depicts the results of scaling the rayleigh cs .",
    "it can be observed that the effect of this scattering is even weaker than that seen for compton scattering .",
    "this effect on the depth - dose curve is not null because , despite that this is an elastic scattering of photons with negligible energy deposition , rayleigh scattering may remove photons from the pencil beam so the dose in the field central axis may be affected .",
    "notice that the sensitivity factor ins this case are always positive .",
    "if the rayleigh scattering cs is reduced , less photons would be scattered out the beam and the central axis dose should increase .",
    "in addition , the effect on the dose distribution increases with depth since photon multiple scattering probability also increases .    since each depth shows a unique and almost constant gradient , the impact of a given cs uncertainty on the depth dose distribution depends on depth .",
    "that is , mc - determined doses for a target sited at depths below or above the equilibrium depth would have greater associated uncertainties than that placed near the ed .",

    "<S> this work studies the impact of systematic uncertainties associated to interaction cross sections on depth dose curves determined by monte carlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding sensitivity factors are quantified by changing cross sections in a given amount and determining the variation in the dose . the influence of total cross sections for all particles , photons and only for compton scattering is addressed . </S>",
    "<S> the penelope code was used in all simulations . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that photon cross section sensitivity factors depend on depth . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , they are positive and negative for depths below and above an equilibrium depth , respectively . at this depth , sensitivity factors are null . </S>",
    "<S> the equilibrium depths found in this work agree very well with the mean free path of the corresponding incident photon energy . using the sensitivity factors reported here , it is possible to estimate the impact of photon cross section uncertainties on the uncertainty of monte carlo - determined depth dose curves .    </S>",
