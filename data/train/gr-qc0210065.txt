    "motion linearized approximation of general relativity ( gr ) , we will deal with some post  newtonian effects of order @xmath3 on the orbits of test bodies freely falling in the terrestrial gravitational field and will examine recent developments about the possibility of measuring them by means of the satellite laser ranging ( slr ) technique .",
    "the geodetic , or de sitter , precession ( de sitter , 1916 ) refers to the coupling of the static , gravitoelectric part of the gravitational field due to the schwarzschild metric generated by a central , non  rotating mass to the spin of a particle freely orbiting around it .",
    "it has been measured for earth ",
    "moon orbit , thought of as a giant gyroscope , in the gravitational field of sun with 1@xmath2 accuracy ( williams et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "it should be measured for four superconducting gyroscopes in the gravitational field of earth by the important gp - b mission ( everitt et al . , 2001 ) at a claimed relative accuracy level of @xmath4 . however , such mission has recently experienced some problems ( lawler , 2003a ; 2003b ) .",
    "perhaps the most famous of the gravitoelectric post ",
    "newtonian orbital effects , the advance of the pericentre @xmath5 of the orbit of a test particle ( i.e. , non  rotating ) due to the schwarzschild part of the metric of a central , non  rotating mass ( ciufolini and wheeler , 1995 ) has represented one of the classical tests of gr thanks to the measurement of the perihelion shifts of mercury and other planets in the gravitational field of sun with the radar ranging technique .",
    "the relative accuracy of such measurements is of the order of 10@xmath610@xmath7 ( shapiro , 1990 ) . here",
    "we will present a proposal for obtaining a complementary measurement of such orbital effect in the gravitational field of earth by using some existing or proposed slr satellites of lageos  type . the achievable relative accuracy should amount to 10@xmath7 ( iorio et al .",
    ", 2002a ) , according to the present ",
    "day knowledge of the models of the gravitational and non  gravitational forces acting on the satellites of lageos  type .",
    "contrary to the classical newtonian mechanics , gr predicts that the gravitational field of a central mass is sensitive to its state of motion .",
    "in particular , if it rotates and has a proper angular momentum j , it turns out that a freely falling body orbiting it is affected by many so called gravitomagnetic effects .",
    "such name is due to the close formal analogies of the linearized approximation of gr with the maxwellian electromagnetism .",
    "for a recent review see ( ruggiero and tartaglia , 2002 ) . in regard to such gravitomagnetic effects , they could be divided into two main categories : those induced by the spin ",
    "spin coupling and those induced by the spin  orbit coupling .      when a spinning particle moves in an external gravitational field one has to describe both its spin precession and the influence of the spin on its trajectory ( khriplovich , 2001 ) .",
    "when the spin j of the central object is taken into account , it turns out that it affects the precessional motion of the spin s of a particle freely orbiting it in a way discovered by schiff ( schiff , 1960 ) in 1960 .",
    "the detection of this subtle precessional effect , in addition to the gravitoelectric geodetic precession of the spin , is one of the most important goals of the gp - b mission ( everitt et al . , 2001 ) ; the claimed accuracy amounts to @xmath1 .    in regard to possible orbital effects on the motion of a spinning particle freely orbiting a central rotating mass in an astrophysical context",
    ", they have been recently calculated in ( iorio , 2003a ) .",
    "unfortunately , they turn out to be too small to be detected in solar system space  based experiments .",
    "see also ( zhang et al . , 2001 ) for a different , phenomenological approach not a priori based on gr , which has been applied to some preliminary earth  based laboratory tests ( zhou et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "the lense  thirring drag of the inertial frames ( lense and thirring , 1918 ) is an effect due to the stationary , gravitomagnetic part of the gravitational field of a central rotating mass on the geodesic path of a test particle .",
    "such effect could be thought of as a spin ",
    "orbit interaction between the spin of the central object and the orbital angular momentum of the test body . for some",
    "spin  orbit effects induced by the rotation of sun on the orbital angular momentum of earth  moon system see ( mashhoon and theiss , 2001 ) . in 1998",
    "the first evidence of the lense  thirring effect in the gravitational field of earth has been reported ( ciufolini et al . , 1998 ) with a claimed accuracy of almost @xmath8 .",
    "it is based on the analysis of a suitable combination of the orbital residuals of the nodes @xmath9 of the lageos and lageos ii slr satellites and of the perigee @xmath5 of lageos ii .",
    "another interesting gravitomagnetic effect of order @xmath3 on the orbit of a test particle has been recently derived in ( iorio , 2002a ) ; it is induced by the temporal variability of the angular momentum of the central mass .",
    "unfortunately , it is too small to be detected with slr in the terrestrial gravitational field .    in this paper",
    "we will show how the launch of the proposed lageos  like lares satellite could allow to measure the lense  thirring effect with an accuracy probably better than @xmath1 ( iorio et al .",
    ", 2002b ) .",
    "moreover , the concept of twin slr satellites placed into identical orbits in orbital planes with supplementary inclinations will be extended to new observables and a possible mission involving the use of an entirely new pair of slr satellites of lageos  type will be sketched .",
    "in all the performed or proposed experiments with which we will deal in this paper the reliable assessment of the error budget is of the utmost importance .",
    "indeed , the terrestrial space environment is rich of competing classical perturbing forces of gravitational and non  gravitational origin which in many cases are far larger than the general relativistic effects to be investigated . in particular , it is the impact of the systematic errors induced by the mismodelling in such various classical perturbations which is relevant in determining the total realistic accuracy of an experiment like those previously mentioned .",
    "the general relativistic effects of interest here are linear trends affecting the node @xmath9 and/or the perigee @xmath5 of the orbit of a satellite .",
    "a lageos  type satellite s orbit is affected by them at a level of @xmath10@xmath11 milliarcseconds per year ( mas / y in the following ) for the gravitomagnetic and the gravitoelectric effects , respectively .    in this context",
    "the most important source of systematic error is represented by the classical secular precessions of the node and the perigee induced by the mismodelled even ( @xmath12 ) zonal ( @xmath13 ) harmonic coefficients @xmath14 of the multipolar expansion of the terrestrial gravitational field , called geopotential .",
    "indeed , while the time  varying tidal orbital perturbations ( iorio , 2001 ; iorio and pavlis , 2001 ; pavlis and iorio , 2002 ) and non  gravitational orbital perturbations ( lucchesi , 2001 ; 2002 ) , according to their periods @xmath15 and to the adopted observational time span @xmath16 , can be viewed as empirically fitted quantity and can be removed from the signal , this is not the case of the classical even zonal secular precessions .",
    "their mismodelled linear trends act as superimposed effects which may alias the recovery of the genuine general relativistic features .",
    "such disturbing trends can not be removed from the signal without cancelling also the general relativistic signature , so that one can only assess as more accurately as possible their impact on the measurement . the systematic error induced by the mismodelled part of the geopotential",
    "can then be viewed as a sort of unavoidable part of the total systematic error .",
    "the same considerations hold also for the aliasing secular trends induced by some tiny non  gravitational thermal perturbations like the terrestrial yarkovsky ",
    "rubincam effect ( lucchesi , 2002 ) .      a possible strategy for reducing the impact of the error due to the geopotential , as we will see in the following sections , consists of suitable combinations of the orbital residuals @xmath17 and @xmath18 of the rates of the nodes and the perigees of different slr satellites . such combinations can be written in the form _",
    "i=1^n c_i f_i = x_gr_gr , in which the coefficients @xmath19 are , in general , suitably built up with the orbital parameters of the satellites entering the combinations , the @xmath20 are the residuals @xmath21 of the rates of the nodes and the perigees of the satellites entering the combination , @xmath22 is the slope , in mas / y , of the general relativistic trend of interest and @xmath23 is the solve  for parameter , to be determined by means of usual least ",
    "square procedures , which accounts for the general relativistic effect .",
    "for example , in the case of the lense  thirring  lageos  lageos ii experiment ( ciufolini , 1996 ) @xmath24 mas / y , while for the gravitoelectric perigee advance ( iorio et al . , 2002a )",
    "@xmath25 mas / y .",
    "more precisely , the combinations of are obtained in the following way .",
    "the equations for the residuals of the rates of the @xmath26 chosen orbital elements are written down , so to obtain a non homogeneous algebraic linear system of @xmath26 equations in @xmath26 unknowns .",
    "they are @xmath23 and the first @xmath27 mismodelled spherical harmonics coefficients @xmath28 in terms of which the residual rates are expressed .",
    "the coefficients @xmath19 and , consequently , @xmath22 are obtained by solving for @xmath23 the system of equations .",
    "so , the coefficients @xmath19 are calculated in order to cancel out the contributions of the first @xmath27 even zonal mismodelled harmonics which represent the major source of uncertainty in the lense  thirring and gravitoelectric precessions ( ciufolini , 1996 ; iorio , 2002b ; iorio et al .",
    ", 2002a ; 2002b ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath19 can be either constant or depend on the orbital elements of the satellites entering the combinations .",
    "now we expose how to calculate the systematic error due to the mismodelled even zonal harmonics of the geopotential for the combinations involving the residuals of the nodes and the perigees of various satellites .",
    "in general , if we have an observable @xmath29 which is a function @xmath30 , @xmath31 of @xmath32 correlated parameters @xmath33 the error in it is given by q=^in which @xmath34 and @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the square matrix of covariance of the parameters @xmath33 .    in our case",
    "the observable @xmath29 is any residuals combination q=_i=1^nc_i f_i(x_j ) ,  j=1,2 ... 10,where @xmath37 are the even zonal geopotential s coefficients @xmath38 . since = _ i=1^n c_i ,",
    "j=1,2 ... 10,by putting in one obtains , in mas / y q=^.the percent error , for a given  trend and for a given combination , is obtained by taking the ratio of to the slope in mas / y of the  trend for the residual combination considered .    the validity of has been checked by calculating with it and the covariance matrix of the egm96 gravity model ( lemoine et al . , 1998 ) up to degree @xmath39 the systematic error due to the even zonal harmonics of the geopotential of the lense  thirring lageos  lageos ii experiment ; indeed the result _",
    "lt=13%  _ ltclaimed in ( ciufolini et al",
    ". , 1998 ) has been obtained again . for the systematic errors due to the even zonal harmonics of the geopotential of alternative proposed gravitomagnetic and gravitoelectric experiments , according to egm96 ,",
    "see ( iorio , 2002b ; iorio et al . , 2002a ; 2002b ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that , since the orbits of the lageos satellites are almost insensitive to the geopotential s terms of degree higher than @xmath39 , the estimates based on the covariance matrix of egm96 up to degree @xmath39 should be considered rather reliable although the higher degree terms of egm96 might be determined with a low accuracy .",
    "it should also be pointed out that the evaluations of the systematic error due to geopotential based on the approach of the combined orbital residuals should be free from some uncertainties due to possible seasonal effects . indeed , according to ( ries et al . , 2003 ) , the covariance matrix of egm96 ( and of other previous gravity models as well ) would not yield reliable results for a generic time span of a few years , but only just for the temporal interval during which the data used for its construction have been collected or , at most , for some very long , averaged time span",
    ". it would be so because of the impact of possible secular , seasonal and stochastic variations of the terrestrial gravity field which would have not been accounted for in the model solution .",
    "however , since it turns out that such seasonal effects would mainly affect just the first even zonal harmonic coefficients of the geopotential , the uncertainty related to them should be very small for residual combinations which , by construction , cancel out just the first even zonal harmonic coefficients of the geopotential . on the other hand , if we cancel out as many even zonal harmonics as possible , the uncertainties in the evaluation of the systematic error based on the remaining correlated even zonal harmonics of higher degree should be greatly reduced , irrespectively of the chosen time span .",
    "moreover , also certain time ",
    "dependent harmonic perturbations of gravitational origin are canceled out .",
    "i.e. , the most insidious of such perturbations is the 18.6year tide which is just a @xmath40 constituent with a period of 18.6 years due to the motion of the moon s node and which affects both the nodes and the perigees of the lageos satellites at a level of 10@xmath41 mas ( iorio , 2001 ) .",
    "it is cancelled out by the combinations of orbital residuals .",
    "a very important point to stress is that the forthcoming new data on earth gravitational field by champ ( pavlis , 2000 ) , which has been launched in july 2000 , and especially grace ( ries et al . ,",
    "2002 ) , which has been launched in march 2002 , should have a great impact on the reduction of the systematic error due to the mismodelled part of geopotential , provided that the great expectations about the level of achievable improvement of our knowledge of the terrestrial gravity field will be finally satisfied",
    ". in particular , if the other existing lageos  type satellites have to be included in the combined residual combinations , it would be very important that the new terrestrial gravity models improve the accuracy in determining the even zonal harmonics of higher degree to which they are sensitive , contrary to the lageos satellites .",
    "the first , very preliminary earth gravity models including some data from champ and grace seem to confirm such expectations ( iorio and morea , 2003 ) .",

    "to the possibility of measuring such rates in the terrestrial gravitational field with slr , in ( ciufolini and matzner , 1992 ) a first attempt using the perigee of lageos only is reported , but the estimated total systematic error is of the order of 20@xmath2 .",
    "if the perigee of lageos or lageos ii only was used , the systematic relative error due to the geopotential , according to the covariance matrix of the even zonal harmonics up to the degree @xmath39 of egm96 , would amount to @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively .",

    "this orbital configuration would be able to cancel out exactly the classical  s , which are proportional to @xmath67 ( iorio , 2002c ) , provided that the observable to be adopted is the sum of the residuals of the  s of lageos iii and lageos ^lageos  iii+^lageos=62.later on the concept of the mission slightly changed .",
    "the area - to - mass ratio of lageos iii was reduced in order to make less relevant the impact of the non - gravitational perturbations , the total weight of the satellite was reduced to about 100 kg , i.e. to about 25@xmath2 of the weight of lageos , and the eccentricity was enhanced to @xmath68 in order to be able to perform other  tests : the lares was born ( ciufolini , 1998 ) . at present the lares experiment",
    "has not yet been approved by any space agency .",
    "although much cheaper than other proposed and approved complex space  based missions , funding is the major obstacle in implementing the lares project",

    "more precisely , for deviations of just 1@xmath69 from the projected nominal supplementary configuration with lageos , the systematic error due to the even zonal harmonics of the geopotential would amount to 1 - 2@xmath2 . of course , this fact would put rather stringent constraints on the quality and , consequently , the cost of the lares launcher .      following the strategy of the combined orbital residuals previously outlined , it could be possible to adopt the following observable ^lageos+c_1^lageosii+c_2^lares+c_3^lageos  ii+c_4^lares=61.8,with c_1 = 610 ^ -3 ,  c_2 = 9.8310 ^ -1 ,  c_3 = -110 ^ -3,c_4 = -210 ^ -3 . according to the covariance matrix of the even zonal harmonics of egm96 up to the degree @xmath39",
    ", the systematic error in due to the geopotential reduces to 0.02@xmath2 , i.e one order of magnitude better than .",
    "moreover , and this is a crucial point , it turns out that such result is completely insensitive to the possible departures of the lares orbital parameters from their nominal values , especially in regard to the inclination @xmath70 , contrary to .",
    "this would allow to use a rather cheap launcher for lares .",

    "of course , when the new , hopefully more accurate data on the static and dynamical parts of the terrestrial gravitational field from the champ and grace missions will be available , a substantial improvement in such estimate should occur",
    ".      it would also be possible to include the data of lares in some combinations of orbital residuals in order to measure the gravitoelectric perigee advance .",
    "e.g. , a possible observable is ^lageos  ii+w_1^lares+w_2^lageos  ii = x_ge_ge , with w_1 = -4.71 ,  w_2 = 2.26 ,  x_ge = -12,117.4  mas / y .",
    "the impact of the uncancelled even zonal harmonics , with degree higher than four , amounts to an uncertainty of about @xmath53 , according to the covariance matrix of the even zonal harmonics up to the degree @xmath39 of egm96 .",
    "this error should be further reduced when the new gravity models from the champ and grace missions will be available .",
    "an interesting feature of is that the impact of the non  gravitational perturbations would produce an uncertainty of about @xmath72 over a time span of 7 years , according to very conservative estimates ( iorio et al . , 2002a ) ;",
    "in particular the earth thermal thrust , i.e. the so - called yarkovski  rubincam effect , would induce a mismodeled secular trend with an uncertainty of only @xmath73 .",
    "for the error due to the non  gravitational perturbations amounts to @xmath74 , while the impact of the yarkovski  rubincam effect amounts to @xmath75 .",
    "the inclusion of lares would thus represent an improvement with respect to the lageos and lageos ii scenario of , especially when , in the near future , the impact of the mismodeled non  gravitational perturbations will increase relatively to the gravitational perturbations thanks to the more accurate earth gravitational field models .",
    "up to now , the concept of twin lageos  type satellites in identical orbits with supplementary inclinations has been used in the context of the originally proposed lageos ",
    "lares mission whose observable is the sum of the nodes of .",
    "it turns out that such concept could be fruitfully extended to another independent observable sensitive to the gravitomagnetic lense  thirring effect . indeed , for a pair of satellites in such orbital configuration , according to ( iorio , 2002c ) and to , on one hand the classical secular precessions of the perigee due to the even zonal harmonics of the geoptential are equal because they depend on @xmath76 and on even powers of @xmath77 , on the other the lense  thirring rates of the perigee are equal and opposite because they depend on @xmath67 .",
    "so , besides the sum of the nodes , also the difference of the perigees ^i -^180 ^ -i = x_lt_ltcould be considered as another independent , although less precise , gravitomagnetic observable ( iorio , 2003b ; 2003c ) .",
    "of course , such observable could not be used in the lares mission because the perigee of lageos is not well defined . moreover",
    ", it would neither be a good idea to think about a possible lares ii satellite supplementary to lageos ii because the perigee of lageos ii is affected by some gravitational and non  gravitational time ",
    "varying perturbations with periods of many years ( iorio , 2001 ; lucchesi 2001 ) , so that over reasonable time spans of only a few years they would resemble superimposed biasing linear trends which would corrupt the measurement of the genuine lense  thirring secular trend .",
    "it turns out that an entirely new pair of twin lageos  type satellites in identical eccentric orbits ( @xmath78 km , @xmath79 ) with supplementary critical inclinations ( @xmath80 , @xmath81 ) would be a good choice .",

    "dependent harmonic perturbations , so that they could be easily fitted and removed from the signal over a time span of a few years .",
    "moreover , since the eccentricities would be the same , the cancellation of the mismodelled classical secular precessions due to the even zonal harmonics of the geoptential would occur at an higher level of accuracy than that of the originally proposed lageos ",

    "thirring effect at an accuracy level of the order of 1@xmath2 by using a not too expensive launcher for lares .",
    "indeed , the error due to the even zonal harmonics of the new proposed observable would be insensitive to the unavoidable orbital injection errors , to the correlations among the even zonal harmonic coefficients and , to a certain extent , to the adopted earth gravity model .",
    "the use of a couple of entirely new slr lageos  type satellites placed into identical eccentric orbits with critical supplementary inclinations would allow to use not only the sum of the nodes but also the difference of the perigees as independent observables for the measurement of the lense  thirring effect .",
    "according to preliminary numerical estimates based on the properties of the existing lageos satellites , the accuracy would be of the order of @xmath1 and @xmath83 , respectively .",
    "when the new , more accurate data for the terrestrial gravitational field from the champ and , especially , grace missions will be available , such estimates should be notably improved .",
    "the first , very preliminary , earth gravity models including some data of champ and grace seem to confirm such expectations .",
