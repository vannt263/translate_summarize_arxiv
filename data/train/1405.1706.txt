    "recently , materials with halide perovskite structure , with the general formula abx@xmath0 , have attracted great interest , primarily because of their potential applications as light harvesters in solar cells @xcite and as topological insulators.@xcite many studies have ensued with the aim of both improving the performance of these materials in photovoltaic cells and of understanding which physical parameters may determine the efficiencies.@xcite for example , lee et al.@xcite report a solution - processable solar cell which uses a perovskite of mixed halide form , namely methylammonium lead iodide chloride , ch@xmath0nh@xmath0pbi@xmath2cl ( abbreviated as mapbi@xmath2cl ) , with a solar - to - electrical power conversion efficiency of 10.9% .",
    "using chemically - tuned mapb(i@xmath3br@xmath4)@xmath0 perovskites as light harvesters , a mesoporous titanium dioxide ( tio@xmath2 ) film , and a hole - conducting polymer , noh et al .",
    "@xcite demonstrate solar cells with a 12.3% power conversion efficiency .",
    "burschka et al .",
    "@xcite describe a sequential deposition method whereby mapbi@xmath0 nanoparticles are formed within porous tio@xmath2 , resulting in a power conversion efficiency of 15% .",
    "liu et al . @xcite",
    "have subsequently shown that such nanostructuring is not necessary for high efficiencies ; a planar heterojunction solar cell , with a deposited thin film of mapbi@xmath2cl acting as a light absorber , can achieve an efficiency exceeding 15% .",
    "mapbi@xmath0 and similar compounds are derived from a class of trihalide perovskite structures with the formula abx@xmath0 ( a = cs , rb ; b = pb ; x = cl , br , i ) by replacing the alkali - metal atom with methylammonium ( ma ) .",
    "such a replacement causes a large downshift in the semiconducting energy gap , making the compounds useful for photovoltaic applications .",
    "it is anticipated that different band gaps may be obtained by replacing methylammonium with other entities such as nh@xmath5 or ch@xmath2ch , by applying pressure , or by using thin films consisting of only a few layers .    to maximize the usefulness of such materials in photovoltaic applications , it is important to begin by developing computational techniques that accurately describe their electronic structure .",
    "density functional theory in the kohn - sham formulation @xcite is the most widely - used method . here",
    ", the exchange - correlation potential is approximated by a functional of the electronic density .",
    "the most common approximations are the local density approximation ( lda),@xcite the generalized gradient approximation ( gga),@xcite and the hybrid approximation.@xcite while lda and gga provide a successful description of ground - state properties in crystals , this success does not extend to a description of excited states . in many semiconductors , lda and gga",
    "strongly underestimate the value of the energy gap .",
    "improved values for the band gaps are usually obtained by using the gw method.@xcite however , the high computational cost of this method limits its applicability to crystals with a small number of atoms in the unit cell .",
    "an exchange potential was recently proposed by becke and johnson ( bj ) , designed to yield the exact exchange potential in atoms.@xcite unfortunately , the use of this potential led to a slight improvement in the energy gap values for many semiconductors.@xcite a simple modification of the bj potential was proposed by tran and blaha.@xcite in this method , known as tb - mbj , the exchange potential is given by    @xmath6^{1/2 } \\label{eq : tbmbjpot}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath7    is the electron density ( @xmath8 is the number of occupied orbitals and @xmath9 is the kohn - sham ( ks ) @xmath10 orbital wave function ) ,    @xmath11\\ ] ]    is the ks kinetic energy density , and    @xmath12\\ ] ]    is the becke - roussel exchange potential.@xcite the function @xmath13 in the above equation is determined by a nonlinear equation involving @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "once @xmath13 is found , @xmath18 is determined by    @xmath19^{1/3}\\ ] ]    in the tb - mbj potential given in eq  ( [ eq : tbmbjpot ] ) ,    @xmath20    where    @xmath21    is the average of @xmath22 over the unit cell of volume @xmath23 .",
    "the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 bohr@xmath26 were chosen because they produce the best fit to the experimental band gaps of many semiconductors .",
    "studies have shown that the tb - mbj potential is generally as accurate in predicting the energy gaps of many semiconductors as the much more expensive gw method.@xcite    despite its many successes , however , the performance of the tb - mbj method is not very satisfactory in certain cases , especially for transition metal oxides . to improve the band gap prediction , koller , tran , and blaha @xcite",
    "consider a more general form for c ,    @xmath27    they vary the values of parameters @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 in order to improve the quality of the fit between the calculated and the experimental energy gaps of many semiconductors . there is an overall improvement in predicting the energy gaps of semiconductors with moderate gaps when @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .",
    "the modified bj method employing these values for @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 will be referred to as the ktb - mbj method .",
    "it should be pointed out that , in terms of computational time and resources , the requirements for the tb - mbj and ktb - mbj methods are essentially the same as those for standard lda or gga methods . therefore , these methods may be easily used to calculate the electronic structure of crystals with large unit cells , where the cost of the gw method is prohibitive .    in this work ,",
    "we present first - principles calculations on the electronic structure of six compounds , namely mapbi@xmath0 , mapbbr@xmath0 , cspbx@xmath0 ( x = cl , br , i ) , and rbpbi@xmath0 .",
    "all of these compounds have a perovskite structure , characterized by a pb atom that is octahedrally coordinated to six halogen atoms .",
    "we show that gga , when spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) is included , severely underestimates the band gaps in these semiconducting materials .",
    "though tb - mbj and ktb - mbj methods lead to significant improvement in the values of the gaps , both methods still underestimate the energy gaps by a wide margin .",
    "we then show that keeping parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 essentially the same as in tb - mbj , while adopting a new value for @xmath28 leads to results that are in excellent agreement with experimental values .",
    "total energy and band structure calculations are carried out using the all - electron , full potential , linear augmented plane wave ( fp - lapw ) method as implemented in the wien2k code.@xcite here , each atom is surrounded by a muffin - tin sphere , and the total space is divided into two regions .",
    "one region consists of the interior of these nonoverlapping spheres , while the rest of the space constitutes the interstitial region .",
    "the radii of the muffin - tin spheres are 2.5 @xmath34 for cs , rb , pb , i , and br , 2.37 @xmath34 for cl , 1.27 @xmath34 for n , 1.33 @xmath34 for c , and 0.68 @xmath34 for h , where @xmath34 is the bohr radius . in gga calculations ,",
    "the exchange correlation potential is that proposed in reference.@xcite    the valence electrons wave functions inside the muffin - tin spheres are expanded in terms of spherical harmonics up to @xmath35 . in the interstitial regions ,",
    "they are expanded in terms of plane waves , with a wave vector cutoff of @xmath36 .",
    "because of the small muffin - tin radius of hydrogen atoms , we set @xmath37 in ch@xmath0nh@xmath0pbi@xmath0 and ch@xmath0nh@xmath0pbbr@xmath0 , where @xmath38 is the muffin - tin radius of the h atom . in the remaining four compounds",
    ", we set @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the smallest muffin - tin radius .",
    "the charge density is fourier expanded up to a maximum wave vector of @xmath41 , where @xmath42 @xmath43 for mapbi@xmath0 and mapbbr@xmath0 , and @xmath44 @xmath43 for the remaining compounds .",
    "the convergence of the self - consistent calculations is achieved with a total energy tolerance of 0.1 mry and a charge convergence of 0.001 e.",
    "at high temperatures , lead halide perovskites have a simple cubic unit cell , where pb sits at the center of the cube and is octahedrally coordinated to six halogen atoms , while alkali atoms sit at the cube corners , as shown in fig .  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "as the temperature is lowered , distortions lead to tetragonal and/or orthorhombic structures . in our calculations",
    ", we use the room temperature crystal structures of the various compounds .",
    "these are listed in table  [ tab:1 ] . for cspbi@xmath0 , which is orthorhombic at room temperature",
    ", we also study the high temperature cubic phase , which was predicted to be a topological insulator when subjected to hydrostatic pressure.@xcite                    the calculated energy bands of mapbi@xmath0 along high symmetry directions in the brillouin zone ( bz ) , in addition to the electronic density of states , are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "the valence band maximum ( vbm ) and conduction band minimum ( cbm ) occur at the @xmath45-point , the bz center . in cubic perovskites ,",
    "the gap occurs at point r(1/2 , 1/2 , 1/2 ) .",
    "however , at room temperature , mapbi@xmath0 has a body - centered tetragonal crystal structure with two formula units per primitive cell .",
    "its conventional unit cell , containing four formula units , is a slightly distorted @xmath46 supercell of the high temperature cubic phase unit cell .",
    "the distortion consists mainly of a rotation of the octahedron by @xmath47 about the c - axis .",
    "point r of the cubic lattice bz is zone - folded into the @xmath45-point of the body - centered tetragonal lattice",
    "the density of states of mapbi@xmath0 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , where we see that the low - lying conduction bands are derived from pb p states . on the other hand ,",
    "the bands in the range -4 ev to -2 ev are dominated by iodine - derived states .",
    "the valence band just below the fermi energy is derived from lead s and iodine p states .",
    "these observations become clear upon considering the atomic orbital character of the bands , which is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "the size of the circles is indicative of the contribution of the chosen atomic orbital to the eigenstates at each * k*-point .",
    "the cbm is derived mostly from pb 6p states .",
    "the vbm , on the other hand , is a mixture of pb 6s and i 5p states .",
    "the antibonding state formed from these s and p states is pushed up in energy close to the fermi level .",
    "the large contribution of pb 6s @xmath48 states to the vbm and pb 6p @xmath49 states to the cbm suggests that there are strong optical transitions between the vbm and cbm @xmath50 , hence the usefulness of this material in solar applications .",
    "ch@xmath0nh@xmath0pbbr@xmath0 ( mapbbr@xmath0 ) has a cubic unit cell .",
    "its band structure is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , and , as expected , the band gap occurs at point r(1/2 , 1/2 , 1/2 ) in the brillouin zone . as with the case of mapbi@xmath0 ,",
    "its vbm is a mixture of pb 6s and br 4p states , whereas its cbm is derived from pb 6p states . in the absence of soc ,",
    "its cbm is six - fold degenerate ( including spin degeneracy ) . due to soc",
    ", its cbm is split into a doublet @xmath51 and a quartet @xmath52 .",
    "the doublet is lowered in energy by an amount @xmath53 , whereas the quartet is raised in energy by @xmath54/@xmath55 , where @xmath56 ev .",
    "similar perovskite structures , namely cssnx@xmath0 ( x = cl , br , i ) , where sn replaces pb , show a much smaller spin splitting of @xmath57 ev.@xcite since the vbm is composed of pb s and br p orbitals , it is shifted slightly upward due to soc on br atoms .",
    "the large energy split of the cbm is , of course , due to the strong soc on pb atoms .",
    "finally , we consider the cspbi@xmath0 crystal . at high temperature ( @xmath58634k ) , the crystal is cubic , but at room temperature , it is strongly distorted to an orthorhombic structure . based on lda and sx - lda calculations ,",
    "it has been suggested that , under hydrostatic pressure , the cubic phase might become a topological insulator.@xcite calculations made using sx - lda suggest a gap of 0.566 ev for cspbi@xmath0 and 0.218 ev for cssni@xmath0 . with decreasing lattice constants , the band width increases and the band gap decreases ;",
    "at some critical pressure , band inversion occurs .",
    "for cspbi@xmath0 and cssni@xmath0 , those critical pressures are predicted to be 3.33 gpa and 0.96 gpa , respectively .",
    "however , gw calculations on cssni@xmath0 give a much larger band gap of 1.008 ev.@xcite our calculation on the cubic phase of cspbi@xmath0 shows that the band gap is 1.07 ev , larger by 0.5 ev than predicted by sx - lda .",
    "assuming linear dependence of the energy gap on lattice constant,@xcite a critical pressure of  6.6 gpa has to be applied to cause band inversion .",
    "the band structure of cubic cspbi@xmath0 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] .",
    "the band gap occurs at point r. as in the cases discussed previously , its cbm is derived from pb 6p states , whereas its vbm is a mixture of pb 6s and i 5p states . without soc ,",
    "the calculated band gap is 2.27 ev , and the cbm is six - fold degenerate ( including spin degeneracy ) .",
    "soc on pb splits its cbm into a doublet @xmath51 and a quartet @xmath52 .",
    "the doublet is lowered in energy by 1.1 ev , while the quartet is raised by 0.55 ev . on the other hand , soc on the i atoms",
    "raises the vbm by 0.1 ev .      as a further check on our results for cubic cspbi@xmath0 , we repeated the calculation of the band gap using the gw approximation within the linear augmented plane wave formalism.@xcite in this method , the electron s proper self energy @xmath59 * is approximated as a product of the electron green s function ( g ) and an effective interaction term ( w ) .",
    "we carried out the calculation in the absence of spin - orbit coupling and using the g@xmath60w@xmath60 and gw@xmath60 approximations .",
    "the electron s proper self energy in these approximations is shown graphically in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] .",
    "we found that within the g@xmath60w@xmath60 approximation , the band gap is 2.04 ev , and it increases to 2.19 ev upon employing the gw@xmath60 approximation .",
    "this result is in excellent agreement with , the value of 2.27 ev , which we obtained for the band gap , in the absence of soc , by using the modified becke - johnson form of the exchange potential .",
    "approximation , and ( c ) g@xmath60w@xmath60 approximation .",
    "w and w@xmath60 are given in ( d ) and ( e ) , respectively .",
    "the single solid line is the noninteracting electron propagator , while the double solid line is the interacting electron propagator .",
    "the single dashed line is the bare coulomb interaction .",
    "the double - dashed line ( w ) is the screened coulomb interaction in the gw approximation , while the wavy line ( w@xmath60 ) is the screened coulomb interaction in the random phase approximation.[fig:6],height=306 ]    in conclusion , we have presented electronic structure calculations on six lead halide compounds using the modified becke - johnson method .",
    "we used the experimental crystal structure of these compounds at room temperature .",
    "we found that by modifying the parameters that characterize the tb - mbj method , we obtain band gaps that are in excellent agreement with experiment .",
    "using this new set of parameters , one should be able to predict the electronic structure of phases of these compounds that occur at different temperatures , as well as those of similar compounds obtained by replacing the alkali metal with various organic cations .",
