    "some years ago , bak , tang , and wiesenfeld introduced the _ sandpile model _ which evolves into a critical state irrespective of initial conditions and without fine tuning of parameters @xcite .",
    "such systems are called _ self  organized critical _ ( soc ) and exhibit power ",
    "law correlations in space and time .",
    "the concept of soc has attracted much interest since it might explain the origin of _ fractal structures _ and _ @xmath1noise_. other soc models e.g. for earthquakes @xcite or the evolution of populations @xcite have been introduced since then , improving our understanding of the mechanisms leading to soc .",
    "recently , a forest - fire model has been introduced which can be viewed as a model for excitable media @xcite .",
    "it becomes self - organized critical when time scales are separated @xcite . in one dimension , the critical exponents could be determined analytically , thus proving the possibility of soc in nonconservative systems @xcite .",
    "analogous to critical phenomena in equilibrium phase transitions , it is expected that the values of the critical exponents depend only on few macroscopic properties of the system as dimension , conservation laws and symmetries , i.e. the critical behavior of the model is _",
    "universal_. computer simulations of the forest - fire model for different lattice symmetries and for a modification with immune trees show indeed universal behavior @xcite , but so far this observation has no analytic foundation .    in this paper",
    ", we show by analytic means that the critical exponents in the one - dimensional forest - fire model are universal when the fire is allowed to jump over holes up to a given size . in sec .",
    "[ u2 ] , we introduce the rules of the model . in sec .",
    "[ u3 ] , we give a short review of the analytic solution of ref . @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ u4 ] , we calculate the critical exponent for the fire size distribution when the fire is allowed to jump over holes of up to @xmath2 sites .",
    "the values of the exponents are confirmed by computer simulations .",
    "finally , we summarize our results .",
    "the forest - fire model is a stochastic cellular automaton which is defined on a hypercubic lattice with @xmath3 sites . in this paper , we consider only the one - dimensional case @xmath4 .",
    "each site is occupied by a tree , a burning tree , or it is empty . during one time step ,",
    "the system is parallely updated according to the following rules    * burning tree @xmath5 empty site * tree @xmath5 burning tree , if at least one neighbor in a distance @xmath6 is burning , @xmath7 * tree @xmath5 burning tree with probability @xmath8 , if no neighbor is burning * empty site @xmath5 tree with probability @xmath9 .",
    "starting with arbitrary initial conditions , the system approaches after a transition period a steady state the properties of which depend only on the parameter values .",
    "we always assume that the lattice is so large that no finite size effects occur .",
    "the steady state is self - organized critical if the parameters satisfy a double separation of time scales @xmath10 the first inequality means that many trees grow between two lightning strokes and therefore large forest clusters and fires occur .",
    "the second inequality means that even large forest clusters burn down before new trees grow at their edge . under these conditions ,",
    "the size distributions of forests and fires obey power laws as we shall see below .",
    "in the case @xmath12 , where the fire is stopped by any empty site , i.e. just jumps to nearest neighbors , many properties of the model have been derived analytically in @xcite . before proceeding to general @xmath2 , we give an illustrative derivation of these results .",
    "the mean number of trees destroyed by a lightning stroke is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the mean forest density in the steady state @xcite .",
    "let @xmath15 be the mean number of forest clusters of @xmath16 trees , divided by the number of sites @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath15 will be shown to obey a power law @xmath18 for clusters smaller than a cutoff @xmath19 besides of possible logarithmic corrections .",
    "the probability that lightning strikes a forest cluster of size @xmath16 is proportional to @xmath20 .",
    "since the fire is stopped by any empty site , the size distribution of fires is also proportional to @xmath20 .    in order to derive the size distribution of fires , consider a string of @xmath21 sites .",
    "this string is too short for two trees to grow during the same time step .",
    "lightning does not strike this string before all of its trees are grown .",
    "since we are always interested in the limit @xmath22 , the following considerations remain valid even for strings of a very large size . starting with a completely empty state , the string passes through a cycle which",
    "is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . during one time step , a tree grows with probabilty @xmath9 on any site . after some time , the string is completely occupied by trees .",
    "then the forest in the neighborhood of our string will also be quite dense .",
    "the forest on our string is part of a forest cluster which is much larger than @xmath23 .",
    "eventually that cluster becomes so large that it is struck by lightning with a nonvanishing probability .",
    "then the forest cluster burns down , and the string again becomes completely empty .",
    "( for a rigorous justification of the neglection of lightning strokes on the n - string leading to random growth of trees , we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite . )",
    "this consideration allows us to write down rate equations for the states of the string . in the steady state , each configuration of trees is generated as often as it is destroyed .",
    "let @xmath24 be the probability that our string is occupied by @xmath25 trees .",
    "each configuration which contains the same number of trees has the same probability .",
    "a configuration of @xmath25 trees is destroyed when a tree grows at one of the empty sites , and is generated when a tree grows in a state consisting of @xmath26 trees .",
    "the completely empty state is generated when a dense forest burns down .",
    "since all trees on our string burn down simultaneously , this happens each time when a given site of our string is on fire .",
    "this again happens as often as a new tree grows at this given site , i.e. with probability @xmath27 per time step .",
    "we therefore have the following equations ( which have been derived more formally in @xcite ) @xmath28 we conclude @xmath29    a forest cluster of size @xmath16 is a configuration of @xmath16 neighboring trees with an empty site at each end .",
    "the size distribution of forest clusters consequently is @xmath30 this is a power law with the critical exponent @xmath31 .",
    "the size distribution of fires is @xmath32 .",
    "there is a characteristic length @xmath33 where the power law @xmath34 breaks down .",
    "we calculate @xmath33 from the condition that a string of size @xmath35 is not struck by lightning until all trees are grown .",
    "when a string of size @xmath23 is completely empty at time @xmath36 , it will be occupied by @xmath23 trees after @xmath37 timesteps on an average .",
    "the mean number of trees after @xmath38 timesteps is @xmath39.\\ ] ] the probability that lightning strikes a string of size @xmath23 before all trees are grown is @xmath40 we conclude @xmath41 leading to @xmath42 .",
    "next we determine the relation between the mean forest density @xmath14 and the parameter @xmath43 .",
    "the mean forest density is given by @xmath44 thus @xmath45 the forest density approaches the value 1 at the critical point .",
    "this is not surprising since no infinitely large cluster exists in a one - dimensional system as long as the forest is not completely dense . combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) and ( [ eq8 ] ) , we obtain the final result for the cluster - size distribution near the critical point @xmath46 with @xmath33 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) .",
    "the size distribution @xmath20 of the fires has also been determined by computer simulations .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "it agrees perfectly with eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) in the region @xmath47 .",
    "we now allow the fire to spread to trees up to a distance @xmath48 from a burning tree , as given by the second rule above",
    ". the fire jumps over holes of up to @xmath2 empty sites , but is stopped by holes of more than @xmath2 sites .",
    "consequently a fire no longer destroys just a single forest cluster , but it may also destroy several clusters which are separated by holes of @xmath0 sites .",
    "the size distribution of fires therefore is no longer given by @xmath20 . in this section",
    ", we will show that the critical exponent which describes the size distribution of fires is still @xmath49 indicating its universality .",
    "we consider a string of @xmath50 sites which is empty in the beginning .",
    "after @xmath38 timesteps , it contains a hole of size @xmath48 with the probability @xmath51 for small @xmath9 but large @xmath52 .",
    "the time after which there are no holes larger than @xmath2 therefore is proportional to @xmath53 .",
    "this time becomes very long for large values of @xmath23 , and consequently the forest is very dense at the moment where all holes larger than @xmath2 have disappeared .",
    "the critical forest density therefore is still @xmath54 . as long as @xmath55",
    ", there is a nonvanishing probability that a hole larger than @xmath2 occurs , and the fire can not spread indefinitely .    as in the previous section ,",
    "we choose @xmath23 so small that the string is not struck by lightning before all empty sites have disappeared , i.e. @xmath56 . in the limit @xmath57 , @xmath33 diverges , and the string can be very large .",
    "the dynamics on our string are exactly the same as before ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , and eqs .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) to ( [ eq7 ] ) are still valid .",
    "the size distribution of forest clusters smaller than @xmath33 remains unchanged , and the critical exponents @xmath31 and @xmath42 characterizing this distribution are universal .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) for the forest density also remains the same in the limit @xmath22 ( besides of a constant which has to be added to the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) but which has already been neglected before , since it is much smaller than @xmath58 ) .",
    "now we calculate the size distribution @xmath59 of fires that destroy @xmath25 trees . for @xmath60 , it can be derived using eqs .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "it is proportional to @xmath25 times the number of configurations which contain @xmath25 trees with at least @xmath48 empty sites at each end and no holes larger than @xmath2 sites between the trees , i.e. @xmath61 since we are only interested in the asymtotic power law for large @xmath25 , this sum can be simplified .",
    "the main contribution comes from values @xmath62 since for larger @xmath63 there are only few configurations which contain no holes larger than @xmath2 ( see the consideration at the beginning of this section ) .",
    "the probability for a hole of size @xmath48 on a string of @xmath64 sites with @xmath65 empty sites is and is obtained as follows : there are @xmath26 possible positions for the hole of size @xmath48 .",
    "the remaining @xmath66 empty sites can be distributed at random over the remaining @xmath67 gaps between trees . to obtain a probability",
    ", we have to divide by all possible configurations of @xmath63 empty sites on @xmath26 gaps . ]",
    "@xmath68 from which we conclude that the first sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) has a cutoff for @xmath69 .",
    "the second sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) counts the number of different configurations of @xmath63 empty sites on @xmath26 gaps with the restriction that each gap contains no more than @xmath2 empty sites . for @xmath63",
    "smaller than the cutoff , the probability for holes larger than @xmath2 is very small anyway , and we are therefore allowed to sum over all configurations of @xmath63 empty sites on @xmath26 gaps which gives @xmath70 . trees on @xmath71 sites with a tree at both ends . ]",
    "we then obtain @xmath72 this is a power law with an exponent @xmath49 which is independent of @xmath2 .",
    "we thus have shown that not only the exponent for the size distribution of forests but also the exponent for the size distribution of fires is universal .",
    "the form of the cutoff functions describing the behavior of these distributions on lengths larger than @xmath33 , however , is different for different values of @xmath2 .",
    "our computer simulations confirm the analytic result . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the size distribution of fires is shown for fire propagation over holes of size 1 and 2 . the slope in the scaling region is @xmath73 each time .",
    "in this paper we have shown by analytic means that the critical exponents of the soc forest - fire model in one dimension show universal behavior when the range of the interaction is changed .",
    "this is additionally confirmed by computer simulations .    in two dimensions , too , computer simulations show that the model is universal under a change of the lattice symmetry . it still remains a challenge to prove universality in dimensions higher than two analytically , e.g. by the renormalization group formalism .",
