    "optomechanical coupling , that is the cross - coupling between the motion of a mirror and a laser field reflected upon it ,  first appeared in the context of interferometric gravitational - wave detection @xcite with the existence of the so - called standard quantum limit @xcite .",
    "the unique sensitivity of interferometric techniques has since then been used for other high - sensitivity measurements , such as afm @xcite or optical transducers @xcite .",
    "the field has recently encountered much attention and has gained a life of its own in the quantum optics community : several schemes involving a cavity with a movable mirror have been proposed either to create non - classical states of both the radiation field @xcite and of the motion of the mirror @xcite , or to perform qnd measurements @xcite .",
    "recent progress in low - noise laser sources and low - loss mirrors have made the field experimentally accessible @xcite .",
    "a recent trend in quantum optics is to fully reconstruct the quantum state of either a mode of the radiation field through the quantum tomography technique @xcite or a trapped atom @xcite , but to our knowledge , no such experiment has yet been performed at the quantum level on a mechanical oscillator .    in this paper",
    ", we present an experiment which completes the analysis of the motion of a plano - convex mirror given in @xcite , reconstructing the phase - space distribution of the motion through the simultaneous classical measurement of both quadratures of the mirror position .",
    "the technique is applied to a variety of states of motion : brownian motion and its cold - damped and squeezed counterparts .    in sec .",
    "[ sec_phasespace ] we present the experimental setup used to monitor the motion of the mirror and we describe how the motion in phase - space can be reconstructed . in sec .",
    "[ sec_brownian ] we consider the case of a free mirror at thermal equilibrium and we compare our experimental results to predictions of the fluctuations - dissipation theorem @xcite .",
    "the experimental setup has also been modified to include an external viscous force applied to the mirror , and a similar analysis is given in sec . [ sec_colddamping ] in the corresponding case of the cold - damped regime .",
    "our results demonstrate that a new equilibrium is obtained with a reduction of thermal noise .    in sec .",
    "[ sec_param ] we present an experiment of parametric amplification of the thermal noise @xcite , below the oscillation threshold .",
    "the experimental setup is modified in order to modulate the strength of the viscous force , and squeezing of the thermal noise has been observed .",
    "the observation of parametric oscillations of the mirror is finally described in sec .",

    "the mirror motion is monitored by an optomechanical displacement sensor .",
    "it relies on the sensitivity of the phase of a reflected light beam to mirror displacements .",
    "monitoring such a phase - shift allows to reconstruct the dynamical evolution of the mirror .",
    "this phase - shift can be induced by various kinds of mirror motions , either external @xcite or internal @xcite .",
    "the former is important for suspended mirrors since the excitation of pendulum modes of the suspension system leads to global displacements of the mirror.the latter corresponds to deformations of the mirror surface due to the excitation of internal acoustic modes of the substrate .",
    "these various degrees of freedom have however different resonance frequencies and one can select the mechanical response of a particular mode by using a bandpass filter .    in our experiment we detect only frequencies around the fundamental acoustic resonance of the mirror so that the mechanical response is mainly ruled by the behaviour of this particular internal mode .",
    "the mirror motion can then be approximated as the one of a single harmonic oscillator characterized by its resonance frequency @xmath1 , its quality factor @xmath2 , and its mass @xmath3 .",
    "this mass actually corresponds to an effective mass which describes the effective motion of the mirror as seen by the light , that is the deformation of the mirror surface averaged over the beam spot @xcite .",
    "the temporal evolution of the mirror position @xmath4 is given by linear response theory @xcite .",
    "assuming that a force @xmath5 is applied to the mirror , the displacement @xmath6 $ ] in fourier space at frequency @xmath7 is related to the force by @xmath8 = \\chi \\left [ \\omega \\right ] f\\left [ \\omega \\right ] , \\label{equ_x}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 $ ] is the mechanical susceptibility of the mirror .",
    "for a viscously - damped harmonic oscillator it has a lorentzian behaviour given by @xmath10 = \\frac{1}{m\\left ( \\omega _ { m}^{2}-\\omega ^{2}-i\\gamma \\omega \\right ) } ,   \\label{equ_chi}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the damping rate @xcite .",
    "depending on the nature of the applied force @xmath5 , the spectrum of the mirror motion will typically be peaked around the mechanical resonance frequency @xmath12 over a frequency span @xmath13 , which is much smaller than @xmath12 for a high-@xmath2 harmonic oscillator .  to study the temporal evolution of the motion in phase - space , it is preferable to describe the motion in the rotating frame in order to remove the intrinsic oscillatory dependence with time .",

    "both position quadratures have a lorentzian response centered at zero frequency and of width @xmath13 .",
    "the harmonic oscillator we consider throughout the paper is the high-@xmath2 fundamental acoustic mode of a mirror coated on a plano - convex resonator made of fused silica .",
    "the resonator is @xmath29 thick at the center with a diameter of @xmath30 and a curvature radius of the convex side of @xmath31 .",
    "such dimensions lead to a resonance frequency of the fundamental mode of the order of @xmath32 .",
    "the oscillator s parameters have the following values @xcite , @xmath33 the mirror coated on the flat side of the resonator is used as the end mirror of a single - ended fabry - perot cavity with a _ newport high - finesse supermirror _ as input mirror ( figure [ fig_setup ] ) .",
    "the whole provides a @xmath34-long cavity with an optical finesse @xmath35 .",
    "the light beam entering the cavity is provided by a frequency - stabilized titane - sapphire laser working at @xmath36 .",
    "the light beam is also intensity - stabilized and spatially filtered by a mode cleaner .    near an optical resonance of the cavity",
    "the intracavity intensity shows an airy peak when the cavity length is scanned through the resonance , and the phase of the reflected field is shifted by @xmath37 .",
    "the slope of this phase - shift strongly depends on the cavity finesse and for a displacement @xmath38 of the end mirror one gets at resonance a phase - shift @xmath39 on the order of @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the optical wavelength and @xmath42 the phase noise of the reflected beam .  at high frequency",
    ", all technical noises can be suppressed and the phase noise corresponds to the quantum noise of the incident beam which is inversely proportional to the square root of the light power .",
    "the phase of the reflected field is monitored by a homodyne detection working at the quantum level . for a @xmath43 incident laser beam",
    ", we have shown that the sensitivity to mirror displacements is limited by the quantum noise of light and it has been measured to @xmath44 at an analysis frequency of @xmath32 @xcite .    to extract both quadratures of the mirror motion we use a demodulation system at frequency @xmath1 ( figure [ fig_demodul ] ) .",
    "a bandpass filter of width @xmath45 @xmath46 first selects frequencies around the fundamental resonance frequency in the signal given by the homodyne detection .",
    "the signal is then mixed with two square signals at frequency @xmath1 , one dephased by @xmath47 with respect to the other one .",
    "harmonics of the output signals are cancelled out by two electronic low - pass filters .",
    "the filters also have to cancel the signal due to other acoustic modes of both the resonator and the coupling mirror .",
    "the expected width of the fundamental mode being of the order of @xmath48 and the closest mode @xmath49 above , we use second - order filters with a @xmath50 cut - off frequency .",
    "we have checked the transfer function of each filter in order to ensure that the dissymmetry between both channels is less than @xmath51 .",
    "note that @xmath14 and @xmath15 are conjugate quantum observables and therefore can not be measured simultaneously at the quantum level .",
    "this is not in contradiction with our experimental setup since we extract the position quadratures @xmath14 and @xmath15 from the phase @xmath52 of the reflected field which also contains the quantum phase noise @xmath42 of light ( eq.[equ_phi ] ) . a measurement of the quadratures is thus contaminated by the quantum noise of light so that it is not possible to measure simultaneously both quadratures at the quantum level .",
    "for this paper this does not constitute a limitation since the signals studied in next sections ( thermal noise and external force ) are way above the standard quantum limit imposed by the measurement and back - action noises @xcite .",
    "we present in this section the results obtained when the mirror is free ( no external force ) and at room temperature .",
    "the thermal equilibrium can be described as the result of a coupling with a thermal bath via a langevin force @xmath53 applied on the mirror.the resulting brownian motion is the response of the acoustic mode to this force according to eq .",
    "( [ equ_x ] ) .",

    "the sensitivity of our experiment is high enough to detect the brownian motion .",

    "the height of the peak is at least 4 orders of magnitude larger than the sensitivity defined by the quantum phase noise of the reflected beam ( eq . [ equ_dxmin ] ) .",

    "this plot can be compared to the brownian motion of a mirror coated on a torsion oscillator , as observed in ref .",
    "@xcite by a similar optical interferometry technique",
    ". the larger density of points and the more circular shape of our results is due to the larger ratio between the acquisition time @xmath60 and the evolution time ( @xmath61 ) of the brownian motion in phase - space . in our experiment , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , so that the phase space is mapped approximately @xmath64 times . in the case of the torsion oscillator ,",
    "as the mechanical resonance frequency is two orders of magnitude lower , @xmath65 and the phase space is mapped just once even for a @xmath66 acquisition time .",
    "this explains why results in ref .",
    "@xcite look similar to the brownian motion of a free particle : ergodicity is irrelevant on such short timescales .",
    "our results are more likely to be compared to the thermomechanical noise observed with an afm cantilever @xcite , although the simpler two - wave technique used in this work yielded a lower sensitivity , on the order of @xmath67 . in this experiment the resonance frequency also lay in the @xmath68 range but the lower mechanical quality factor of the cantilever drastically lowered the timescale of the brownian motion , enabling to display results comparable to ours .",

    "the variance of quadrature @xmath15 increases and diverges at the oscillation threshold @xmath158 , whereas the one of quadrature @xmath14 goes down to @xmath159 .",
    "the efficiency of parametric amplification which is mainly related to the power of the auxiliary laser beam is large enough to obtain a gain @xmath123 close to unity.one then reaches the @xmath160 theoretical limit of squeezing for the variance of quadrature @xmath14 .",
    "as in usual parametric amplification the system oscillates above threshold , that is for a gain @xmath123 larger than @xmath82 .",
    "this threshold is actually a consequence of the fact that the gain @xmath161 of parametric amplification becomes equal to the mechanical losses which are related to the damping @xmath162 .",
    "the damping @xmath143 then vanishes and the noise of quadrature @xmath15 becomes infinite . above threshold",
    "the mirror oscillates at frequency @xmath1 in phase with quadrature @xmath15 .",
    "the amplitude of oscillation depends both on the gain and on saturation mechanisms which take place in the parametric oscillation regime .",
    "in our case they are mainly related to the saturation of the intensity modulation of the auxiliary laser beam .",
    "the distribution of the mirror motion no longer appears as a peak located at the center of phase - space ( @xmath163 , @xmath164 ) .",
    "it rather looks like a squeezed distribution centered at a non - zero position along the @xmath165 axis , the amount of squeezing depending on the distance to threshold . as the modulation of",
    "the feedback loop is at frequency @xmath147 , the system is invariant by a @xmath166 phase - shift and there are two possible positions for the center of the distribution , one for a positive value of @xmath167 , the other one for a negative and opposite value @xmath168 .",
    "figures [ fig_coolabov ] and [ fig_coolabo2 ] show the experimental temporal evolutions and distributions obtained above threshold , respectively for a gain close to unity and for a larger gain . as expected the distribution in figure [ fig_coolabov ] exhibits two peaks along the @xmath165 axis , symmetrically located with respect to the center .",
    "the temporal evolution ( top curve in figure [ fig_coolabov ] ) also shows a concentration of the mirror motion around the two opposite positions .",
    "one can however note that the motion sometimes explores the neighbourhood of the center of phase - space and can jump from one position to the other one .",
    "delay between two jumps can be as small as a few seconds for a gain very close to unity and corresponds to a few minutes in the case of figure [ fig_coolabov ] .  over the @xmath45-minutes acquisition time of the distribution",
    "the system has actually made only one jump and it has stayed a longer time near the negative position than near the positive one .",
    "this explains why the negative peak is higher than the positive one .  for a longer acquisition time one would obtain symmetric peaks .",
    "for a larger gain the system can stay a few hours without any jump .  during the acquisition time",
    "the mirror then stays near one position and the distribution exhibits only one peak as shown in figure [ fig_coolabo2 ] .",
    "parametric oscillation also squeezes the mirror motion along the @xmath14 quadrature .  as usual",
    "the squeezing effect is larger close to threshold and the distribution goes back to a disk for large gain ( figure [ fig_coolabo2 ] ) .",
    "in contrast with parametric oscillation in optics @xcite , the fluctuations are of the same order as the mean value of the oscillation , that is the distance between the two peaks in figure [ fig_coolabov ] is of the same order as their widths . as a consequence one can not use a linear approach to describe the evolution of fluctuations and the distribution does not appear as an ellipse but as a more complex and distorted shape @xcite .",
    "it is however possible to evaluate the variance @xmath169 and one obtains in the case of figure [ fig_coolabov ] a variance equal to @xmath170 times the variance of the thermal noise at room temperature .",
    "let us finally note that the amplitude of the peaks ( distance to the center of phase - space ) depends on the gain .",
    "one gets a larger amplitude for a higher gain .",
    "there is however a limit related to the saturation of the feedback loop . for a very large gain the radiation pressure applied on the mirror",
    "is limited by the modulation capabilities of the laser beam intensity .",
    "one can easily estimate this limit .  when the feedback loop saturates , the intensity modulation tends towards a square signal with a @xmath171 modulation depth .",
    "the component of the radiation pressure force at frequency @xmath1 is thus on the order of @xmath172 where @xmath173 is the light power .  in this expression @xmath174",
    "represents the constant force exerted by light without modulation and @xmath175 is a correction factor due to the fact that the modulation corresponds to a square signal rather than to a sine one .",
    "the response of the mirror is a forced oscillation with a non - zero mean amplitude @xmath176 obtained by identifying the intrinsic damping force to the radiation pressure ,    @xmath177    for a @xmath178 beam , this corresponds to a mean displacement of @xmath99 @xmath179 , in very good agreement with the one observed in figure [ fig_coolabo2 ] .",
    "we have presented an experiment of high - sensitivity displacement measurement , reconstructing the phase - space distribution of a mechanical oscillator with a thousand - fold increase in sensitivity upon what had previously been reported .",
    "the sensitivity of our experimental setup is currently limited to @xmath180 by the damping timescale of the oscillator , but it could easily be extended to the attometer level by reducing the analysis bandwidth .",
    "both feedback schemes studied in this paper are able to reduce the thermal noise of the mirror .",
    "their effects however are different .  in the case of cold damping the resulting state",
    "is still a thermal equilibrium but at a lower effective temperature , in principle down to a zero temperature for a very large gain @xcite .",
    "one then gets a symmetric gaussian distribution in phase - space .",
    "in contrast , parametric amplification only cools one quadrature of the mirror motion , the other one being heated.one then gets squeezed thermal states with an asymmetric gaussian distribution in phase - space .",
    "this situation is somewhat equivalent to the one which would be obtained with quadrature - dependent feedback loops where the zero - temperature quantum state of the mirror should be reached via squeezed thermal states @xcite .",
    "these results show that the observation of motion in phase - space gives a better understanding and control of optomechanical coupling , on the way to experimental demonstration of related quantum effects .",
    "damping for internal acoustic modes may not be viscous , but as we only consider the motion at frequencies close to the mechanical resonance , there is no observable difference .",
