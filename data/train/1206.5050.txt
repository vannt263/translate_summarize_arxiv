    "the question of pairing in polarized fermionic systems came to the fore shortly after superconductivity in unpolarized systems was explained by bcs  @xcite as being due to the formation of cooper pairs with zero center of mass momentum .",
    "fulde and ferrell  @xcite and independently larkin and ovchinnikov  @xcite proposed similar but not identical mechanisms whereby the fermions form pairs with nonzero center of mass momentum .",
    "we will refer to such a phase as the fflo phase . on the other hand",
    ", sarma  @xcite proposed a mechanism where , in spite of the mismatch in the fermi momenta due to the spin population imbalance , the pairing occurs with zero center of mass momentum . verifying these predictions",
    "experimentally proved difficult in condensed matter systems  @xcite .",
    "however , thanks to rapid experimental progress in the domain of ultra - cold atoms , it is now possible to study such population imbalanced systems .",
    "fermionic atoms are made to occupy two hyperfine states thus emulating a system with `` up '' and `` down '' spins .",
    "an advantage of these systems is that the population imbalance ( the polarization ) and the interaction strengths are highly tunable .",
    "such experiments have been performed in three - dimensional  @xcite and one - dimensional  @xcite systems .",
    "it is by now widely accepted that at @xmath0 the fflo phase is robust over a wide range of parameters in one - dimensional systems with imbalanced fermion populations .",
    "this was shown in various numerical studies using , for example , qmc @xcite and dmrg @xcite . in a previous work",
    "we also showed that the fflo phase is stable over a wide range of parameters in the temperature - polarization ( tp ) phase diagram @xcite .",
    "this exotic pairing occurs both in homogeneous and confined systems , and has been shown to survive up to relatively high temperatures ( @xmath1 ) which are achievable in current experiments .",
    "the question of the stability of this phase in higher dimensions remains a subject of debate .",
    "it is believed that `` nesting '' of the fermi surfaces stabilizes fflo pairing .",
    "for example in one dimension one wave - vector connects all points on the fermi surfaces of each species , which would enable all particles from the fermi surfaces to participate in the formation of pairs with finite - momentum .",
    "the effect of `` nesting '' is considerably weaker in higher dimensions . in a two - dimensional lattice system ,",
    "the shape of a fermi surface depends on the filling . at half filling",
    "the fermi surface becomes a square and touches the edge of the first brillouin zone ( van hove singularity ) . around this filling , matching of the fermi surfaces",
    "becomes more efficient , in other words the `` nesting '' is enhanced as compared to the situation when both fermi surfaces are circular ( low filling ) .",
    "this reasoning leads us to expect that fflo pairing should be more prevalent around half filling than at lower fillings .",
    "this lattice enhanced stability of fflo was studied using mean field ( mf ) methods in @xcite and @xcite . in the latter",
    "the authors point also at hartree corrections and domain wall formation as additional reasons for enhancement .",
    "numerous theoretical studies of the system in higher dimensions do not offer a clear conclusion on the stability of the fflo mechanism . in a variational mf study of a three dimensional system in the continuum with and without a trapping potential",
    "it is observed that fflo is a fragile state which can be realized only in a tiny sliver of the interaction - polarization phase diagram @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this study showed that in a trap , fflo can exist only in a thin shell of the atomic cloud .",
    "another study of a three dimensional fermi gas at unitarity  @xcite shows that this phase is competitive over a large region in the phase diagram .",
    "however , the trap would need to be adjusted to allow fflo to occupy a large enough spatial region to be observed . on the other hand , in a bogoliubov - de gennes study @xcite of a trapped system ,",
    "the calculated phase diagram indicates that the ground state of the system is always fflo for any imbalance up to some critical value .",
    "the unsettled status of this phase in higher dimensionality may be clarified with exact numerical simulations .",
    "however , simulations of the hubbard model in three dimensions are not feasible for large systems at low enough temperatures due to the severity of the `` fermion sign problem '' .",
    "on the other hand , exact qmc simulations in two dimensions are feasible but so far none have been done .",
    "in addition , two dimensional systems are intermediate between one dimension where mf is almost certain to fail and three dimensions where mf is more reliable .",
    "consequently , there has been a concerted , yet inconclusive , effort to understand fflo physics theoretically in two - dimensional systems .",
    "homogeneous and trapped two - dimensional polarized fermi gases have been studied with mf calculations which exclude the possibility of fflo pairing ( for _ e.g. _ @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "an interaction - polarization phase diagram is shown in @xcite where fflo pairing is seen to occupy a wide region .",
    "@xcite obtain mf phase diagrams in the polarization versus filling plane for one- , two- and three - dimensional systems .",
    "in the two - dimensional system there is a very strong feature around the van hove singularity of the majority component and the fflo phase is present over a wide range of parameters around this value .",
    "they also show temperature - polarization phase diagrams of one dimensional system which were shown not to agree with exact qmc results @xcite .",
    "the temperature - polarization phase diagram in three dimensions is shown as well but not the two dimensional case .",
    "studies of quasi two - dimensional systems have been done using mf and they predict a first - order transition to fflo at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "another mean field study of two - dimensional two - orbital hubbard model with p - orbitals and highly unidirectional hopping shows enhancement of the fflo region in the phase diagram due to the one - dimensional character of the fermi surface @xcite .",
    "a dmrg study of population imbalanced fermi gas on two - leg ladders has found fflo pair correlations @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a determinant qmc ( dqmc ) @xcite study of the two dimensional hubbard model with imbalanced populations of up and down spins . in section",
    "ii we present the model and discuss our results for the uniform system in section iii . our main result here is the demonstration of the robustness of the fflo phase and the determination of the phase diagram in the temperature - polarization plane at low filling .",
    "we also compare the behavior of the system at low and half fillings . in section",
    "iv we examine the system in a harmonic trap .",
    "our conclusions are in section v.",
    "the system of interest is governed by the two - dimensional fermionic hubbard hamiltonian @xmath2 where @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) create ( annihilate ) a fermion of spin @xmath5 on lattice site @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the corresponding number operator . the near neighbor , @xmath8 , hopping parameter is @xmath9 which we take equal to unity to set the energy scale .",
    "we consider only on - site interaction with an attractive coupling constant @xmath10 .",
    "the number of particles in each population is governed by its chemical potential ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the harmonic trap is introduced via the @xmath12 term in the hamiltonian where @xmath13 is the position of the center of the trap ( also middle of the lattice ) .",
    "all simulations are performed with periodic boundary conditions . in the confined case we ensured that the density vanishes at the edge of the lattice .",
    "the main quantities of interest in this study are the single particle green functions @xmath14 and the pair green function , @xmath15 , @xmath16 where @xmath17 creates a pair on site @xmath6 .",
    "the fourier transform of @xmath18 gives the momentum distribution of the spins-@xmath19 species while the transform of @xmath20 yields the pair momentum distribution . in the trapped case ,",
    "the density profiles of the two species are also studied .",
    "we studied this system numerically using the dqmc @xcite algorithm . in this approach , the hubbard - stratonovich ( hs ) transformation is employed to decouple the quartic interaction term into two quadratic terms coupling the number operator of each species , @xmath21 , to the hs field which effectively acts as a site and imaginary time dependent chemical potential",
    "the fermion operators can now be traced out leading to a partition function in the form of a product of two determinants , one for each spin , summed over all configurations of the hs field . for @xmath10 and",
    "equal populations , @xmath22 , the determinants are identical ; their product is always positive .",
    "but in the imbalanced case , @xmath23 , the two determinants are no longer equal and their product can , and does , become negative leading to the known `` fermion sign problem '' .",
    "this is the main obstacle to the simulation of this system .",
    "we found that at low total filling the sign problem is manageable even at large polarizations and low temperatures .",
    "this was not the case closer to half filling .",
    "typical simulations of the harmonically confined system at low temperature took about two weeks on a 3 ghz processor .    in the presence of the trapping potential ,",
    "we have also studied the system using a mean - field approach .",
    "starting from the full fermi - hubbard hamiltonian  , one can derive the mean - field hamiltonian : @xmath24 where @xmath25 are on - site pairing amplitudes ; @xmath26 is the nambu spinor .",
    "the matrix @xmath27 depicts the one particle hamiltonian , namely hopping terms between nearest neighbors @xmath28 and chemical potential terms @xmath29 . to account properly for spatial inhomogeneities ,",
    "the bcs order parameter at each site , @xmath30 , is an independent variable  @xcite , whose value is determined , for a given temperature , by a global minimization of the free energy , @xmath31 associated with the mean - field hamiltonian : @xmath32 where the @xmath33 are the @xmath34 eigenvalues of the nambu matrix @xmath35 ; @xmath36 is the number of sites .",
    "the minimization of the free energy is performed using a mixed quasi - newton and conjugate gradient method ; additional checks were performed to ensure that the global minimum has been reached .",
    "to set the stage , we start with the homogeneous two dimensional hubbard model with balanced populations at total density @xmath37 . with balanced populations , the pairs form with zero center of mass momentum and a sharp peak in the pair momentum distribution",

    "the issue of this dimensionally driven transition caused considerable interest .",
    "it is interesting to look at the intermediate two dimensions and study the behavior of the density profiles to see whether it follows more closely any of the two limiting scenarios . during our simulations we measure the density profiles of each species and calculate the local magnetization @xmath186 .",

    "where we have shown the relevance of the harmonic levels at low fillings , we believe that this effect stems from the underlying harmonic level structure . in the balanced case , it has already been shown that the density of a fermionic cloud in a trap can exhibit oscillations with minima or maxima in the center of the trap depending on whether the last filled state corresponds to an odd or even harmonic level  @xcite .",

    "this pattern appears first at the center of the trap simply because it corresponds to half filling which , as explained in a previous section , is strongly unstable towards the fflo state .",

    "the fflo state is similar to the bulk situation ( _ i.e. _ particles having a quadratic dispersion relation ) , where the pairs have a vanishing total angular momentum , but a finite radial component for the center of mass momentum . on the contrary , around half - filling",

    "we have given an explanation in terms of matching fermionic momentum on the fermi surfaces .",
    "we have also shown that , in the presence of an harmonic confinement and at low fillings , the harmonic level basis gives rise to a simple understanding of the pairing mechanism .",
    "in addition , we have shown that the harmonic levels are at the origin of the oscillations seen in the local magnetization , which , therefore , are not a signature of the fflo state .",
    "finally , still in the presence of an harmonic confinement , but around half filling , we have shown that the pairing mechanism is essentially identical to the homogeneous situation , leading to clear signatures in the pair density , both in real space ( checkerboard pattern ) and in fourier space ( four peaks ) , which allows for a possible experimental observation with cold atoms .    in the presence of a harmonic trap",
    ", it would be interesting to study the dynamics of the pairs in response to a sudden quench from balanced to imbalanced populations where our study indicates that one could expect to observe the oscillations of the center of mass in the trap .",

    ", one should be able to determine the nature of the pairing and possible transitions between paired phases .",
    "one should also take into account the effects of terms beyond mean field to determine properly the critical temperature of the transition ( bkt - like ) and to estimate the strength of the quantum fluctuations thus allowing for a better comparison with possible experimental results .",
