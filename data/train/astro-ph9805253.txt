    "the understanding of the formation , evolution and present properties of the large  scale structure of the universe is a key problem in modern cosmology ( see peebles 1980 , 1993 ) .",
    "one of the most important results of the first redshift surveys was the previously unexpected existence of coherent structures and voids at very large scales . explaining these structures was a challenge for popular models of galaxy formation , but at the same time represented a problem for the interpretation of results obtained on small volumes which could not be representative of the universe .",
    "therefore , the need of a  fair sample \" of the universe , in order to understand the process of galaxy formation and evolution , led to an increasing number of deeper redshift surveys .",
    "redshift surveys are now an  industry \" with its own standards .",
    "reduction of an ever growing number of data is based on software packages specially developed to this aim .",
    "the redshift @xmath3 , or , less rigorously , the  recession velocity \" @xmath4 , is commonly determined using the wavelength shift of either absorption or emission lines appearing in the optical spectrum of a galaxy .",
    "following the paper by tonry & davis ( 1979 ) , most redshifts based on absorption lines are now obtained by cross  correlating galaxy spectra with one or more ( or an average of ) `` template '' spectra , while redshifts based on emission lines are measured by fitting the individual emission lines .",
    "moreover , emission and absorption lines are produced in different environments . in normal galaxies , the former ( such as the [ oii]@xmath5 line )",
    "are generated in hii regions associated with recent star  formation , while the latter ( such as the calcium ca ii @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) are produced in stellar atmospheres and are related to the bulk of the star population . as a consequence , emission and",
    "absorption redshifts are not required to be exactly the same .    despite the growing number of galaxy redshifts in the literature ,",
    "most catalogues quote only the `` best '' estimate of the velocity of a galaxy , and take for granted the implicit and widespread assumption that , while for a given galaxy the absorption velocity @xmath0 and the emission velocity @xmath1 may differ , the average difference should be consistent with zero .    in the analysis of the eso slice project ( esp ; vettolani et al .",
    "1997 ; zucca et al . 1997 ; vettolani et al . 1998 ) , we have devoted a particular effort to check the quality of our data , and in particular the precision of our absorption and emission redshift measurements which , as we have soon realized , present a puzzling discrepancy .",
    "looking at the past and recent literature , we have also realized that this problem was not new , but was never discussed in a satisfactory way .",
    "we have therefore decided to study the effect in more detail , and we describe in this paper the results of our analysis and the possible explanations .    in section 2",
    "we discuss the evidence of discrepancies in   found in the past and in other surveys , and in section 3 we present the discrepancy detected in the esp data . in section 4 we describe the tests we have performed on the esp data , exploring instrumental and other effects which could in principle affect our results ; in section 5 we analyse in detail the biases on velocity measurements due to the choice of the template spectra ; in section 6 we discuss if such a discrepancy can be partly due to a real , physical effect ; our conclusions are in section 7 .",
    "systematic differences in redshift measurements have been detected and discussed in the past .",
    "for example , roberts ( 1972 ) found a systematic difference between the hi and the optical redshifts of galaxies in the velocity range between 1200 and 2400 km / s , which he attributed to the blending of galaxian and sky ca ii @xmath7 and @xmath6 absorption lines .",
    "a small effect in the same range of velocities was also found by sandage ( 1978 ) , with @xmath8  km / s and @xmath9  km / s , i.e. a positive difference between absorption and emission velocities corresponding to about + 70 km / s .",
    "sandage applied then a zero  point correction of + 30 km / s to the redshifts , for consistency with hi velocities , but tonry & davis ( 1979 ) found that the redshifts of the galaxies they had in common with sandage were consistent with sandage redshifts only if his correction was not applied .",
    "these puzzling results were not isolated .",
    "corwin & emerson ( 1982 ) analysed the spectra of 71 galaxies , and for 24 galaxies with both absorption and emission velocities they found @xmath10  km / s ( hereafter @xmath11 will always indicate the difference @xmath12 ) .",
    "lewis ( 1983 ) found a zero  point error of about 30 km / s in the data of shectman , stefanik & latham ( 1983 ) , for which   was systematically negative .",
    "interestingly enough , when regarding the cases with the largest residuals , he found that the @xmath13 velocity was nearer to the @xmath0 and also that   was systematically positive .",
    "he concluded that these cases `` [ ... ] are most probably explained as large gas outflows from the nucleus '' .",
    "similarly , mirabel & sanders ( 1988 ) measured @xmath14 km / s , where @xmath15 refers to emission line velocities , for a sample of ultra ",
    "luminous dusty iras galaxies ; they concluded that `` the discrepancy could be due to optical line  emitting gas moving radially , probably outward , in the central regions of luminous infrared galaxies . if such outwardly moving emitting ",
    "line gas is mixed with dust , the attenuation of emission from the far side leads to an observed optical redshift below systemic . ''",
    "similar results have been found for the [ oiii ] @xmath165007 line in the narrow line region of agns ( see wilson & heckman 1985 and section 4 ) .",
    "the above discussion shows that a ) non  negligible systematic zero ",
    "point differences are a common problem in redshift surveys ; b ) sometimes , a systematic difference may be due to physical reasons , as in the case of ultraluminous infrared galaxies ; c ) with small number of galaxies , it is difficult to determine the amplitude and the reasons of the difference .",
    "a better analysis of this problem can be done with larger samples . for the main surveys where both absorption and emission line redshifts are available",
    ", we show in table 1 the acronym of the survey ( column 1 ) , the number @xmath17 of galaxies in the sample ( column 2 ) , the limiting apparent magnitude ( column 3 ) and the mean @xmath18 with its error ( column 4 ) . at relatively bright magnitudes ( @xmath19 )",
    ", we have 3 main redshift surveys where both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are available for more than @xmath20 galaxies : the anglo ",
    "australian redshift survey ( aars ; peterson et al . 1986 ) , the south african astronomical observatory redshift survey ( saao ; menzies et al .",
    "1989 ) , and the stromlo ",
    "apm redshift survey ( loveday et al . 1996 ) . as apparent from table 1",
    ", the first two surveys do not show any systematic difference between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "loveday et al .",
    "( 1996 ) find @xmath21  km / s for the stromlo ",
    "apm redshift survey , and conclude that this value  is negligible compared with the rms difference of 124 km / s \" . indeed in the literature the average value of @xmath11 is often compared only with the rms of the @xmath11 distribution . however , as loveday et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have 825 galaxies with reliable absorption and emission velocities , this implies a standard error on the mean of about 4 km / s , i.e. the value of @xmath22 km / s formally differs from zero at more than @xmath23 level .",
    "such a systematic effect is obviously negligible , but in other cases it is not , and it is important to keep distinct the rms of the @xmath11 distribution from the standard error of the mean .",
    "there is indeed another source of redshifts , which gives a somewhat different result : it is the redshift catalogue for a magnitude limited sample ( @xmath24 ) obtained with the flair multi ",
    "object spectrograph ( parker & watson 1990 ) . for a sample of 80 galaxies , the measures of redshift made on the red part of the spectrum give @xmath25 km / s , with rms @xmath26 km / s :",
    "this means that the discrepancy is significant . among various tests ,",
    "parker & watson show that velocity measures of the night sky emission lines are systematically shifted of about @xmath27 km / s . on the other hand ,",
    "absorption velocities are measured by cross ",
    "correlating with only one template and , as they notice , an error of @xmath28 km / s on the published velocity of the template could explain the difference . for these reasons ,",
    "it is not possible to prove the existence of a real discrepancy in the flair data .",
    "the situation is different when looking at results obtained at fainter magnitudes .",
    "for the durham / anglo  australian telescope faint galaxy redshift survey ( broadhurst et al .",
    "1988 , hereafter bes ) , with an apparent magnitude limit @xmath29 , 97 galaxies have both absorption and emission velocity .",
    "while broadhurst et al . do not discuss the problem , from their published velocities and their quoted redshift precision of @xmath30 km / s , we find a systematic difference @xmath31 km / s .    .mean",
    "@xmath32   for various recent redshift surveys [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     in this case the cross ",
    "correlation has apparently overestimated the redshift by @xmath30 km / s relatively to the gaussian fitting measure .",
    "it can be noticed that neither template no.4 nor template no.7 are among the 3 best  fitting templates , and template no.6 gives a relatively high velocity .",
    "we still find a positive @xmath33 km / s ; however , if we could generalize this result , by concluding that the cross ",
    "correlation overestimates the redshift by @xmath20 km / s , the velocity bias would obviously vanish .",
    "the problem is that for spectra with a lower s / n ratio the direct measure of absorption lines is much more uncertain , and when the velocity difference between absorption and emission lines is around 100 km / s the gaussian fitting of a few lines is not sufficiently accurate .",
    "we tried to avoid this problem by selecting a subset of 16 spectra with a large @xmath34 parameter , most of them with 4 emission lines , and with a positive @xmath11 : this subset has an average @xmath35 km / s .",
    "we have shifted these spectra to the rest wavelength expected from their measured _ absorption line _ velocity , as given by _ xcsao _ ; then we have added these spectra , to build a composite spectrum with higher s / n ratio .",
    "we show this spectrum in figure [ fig : composite ] . before addition",
    ", the individual spectra were resampled to 2048 pixels .",
    "we have measured the wavelengths of the main lines through a gaussian fit .",
    "we find that the emission lines are systematically blueshifted : the [ oii]3727 by @xmath36 km / s , the @xmath37 by @xmath38 km / s , and the 2 [ oiii ] lines respectively by @xmath39 km / s and @xmath40 km / s .",
    "the [ oiii ] lines show also an asymmetric `` bump '' in their blue tail .",
    "on the other hand , the wavelength of the ca ii @xmath7 line is at @xmath41  , corresponding to zero km / s .",
    "however , all the other absorption lines are also blueshifted .",
    "for example , the ca ii @xmath6 line has a shift corresponding to -96 km / s .",
    "the @xmath42 line gives @xmath43 km / s , the g  band @xmath44 km / s , the feca -39 km / s .",
    "the absorption @xmath37 and mg@xmath45 lines are also present , but they are quite asymmetric , so that a gaussian fit can not be a reliable measure .    computing the average velocity of the selected lines with their errors , we find @xmath46 km / s including the ca ii @xmath7 line , or @xmath47 km / s excluding it , and @xmath48 km / s .    before drawing strong conclusions",
    ", we should emphasize that the gaussian fit is not very accurate , as it depends on the estimate by eye of the continuum ; moreover , the spectra have been chosen for their strong absorption lines , which implies that they are not among those spectra with the strongest emission lines , and might not be representative of the total sample ; finally , the effect will be somewhat diluted as each galaxy has a different @xmath11 .",
    "we have also applied the cross  correlation method to the composite spectrum .",
    "the formally lowest errors are obtained with the standard shectman template , giving @xmath49 km / s ( @xmath50 ) , and our template no.8 , giving @xmath51 km / s ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the lcrs a template , with strong balmer lines , performs poorly ( @xmath53 ) but gives @xmath54 km / s , a measure in good agreement with the estimate derived from the gaussian fit of the lines ..    with all the uncertainties we have mentioned , it seems that the cross ",
    "correlation overestimates the redshift , apparently giving a large weight to the cai @xmath7 line near the 4000   break , thus confirming , at least in part , the suggestion by shectman et al .",
    "it appears that in our case the effective rest wavelength should be fixed to about @xmath55   ( comparable to the third wavelength value for this line listed by humason et al .",
    "1956 ) , instead of the usual 3968.5  .",
    "we can not conclude , however , that this effect can completely explain the discrepancy with the emission line redshift .",
    "notice in fact that in the average spectrum the two [ oiii ] emission lines are still discrepant by about 70 km / s relatively to the average of the absorption line velocities ( excluding the ca ii @xmath7 line ) .",
    "moreover , as the above examples have shown , for a given galaxy we have no way to decide _ a priori _ which is the template giving the best estimate , if we leave the best ",
    "fit criterium . for the above reasons",
    ", we decided to measure the redshifts of all spectra in the esp with the technique of the best ",
    "fitting template , without forcing a given template to fit a given class of galaxies .",
    "on the other hand , the choice of the template which gives velocities in agreement with emission line velocity means we assume that the system velocity is given on the average by the emission line velocity . in the absence of a definitive understanding of the bias ,",
    "we think it is important to check that emission lines are on the average at rest , and that they can not have at least partially , a physical origin .",
    "we will briefly consider this possibility in the next section .",
    "a relative shift of absorption and emission lines can be a consequence of significant infall or outflow of gas in a galaxy .",
    "cowie et al . ( 1995 ) in fact find evidence of infall of gas from their observations of distant galaxies . assuming that at least part of the velocity shift detected in the esp is real , we have to find a relatively common process internal to galaxies which can give rise to `` peculiar motions '' , with outflow of the line emitting gas of @xmath30 km / s .",
    "as briefly mentioned in the introduction , a similar effect exists for the narrow  line region of agns , consisting in a systematic blueshift of the [ oiii]5007 line velocity relatively to the hi or absorption line velocity , and amounting to about @xmath56@xmath20 km / s ( wilson & heckman 1985 ) , with the difference ranging between -250 and 250 km / s",
    ". it can be due to the asymmetry of the line , generated by an outflow component on the near side of the agn ( see peterson 1997 ) .",
    "it is known that emission lines from normal galaxies tend to trace the young stars formed in hii regions located on the spiral arms of late  type galaxies , while the absorption lines dominate the stellar light from the inner bulge component of galaxies ( vogel et al .",
    "1988 ; see also knapen et al .",
    "1992 ) . however , there is no evidence that the velocity bias we see is connected to the rotation of galaxies as there is no clear correlation between @xmath57 and galaxy inclination , as we could determine from the axial ratios .",
    "while individual hii regions usually have thermal expansion velocities of @xmath58 km / s , which is insufficient to account for the result , there is growing evidence of substantial amounts of diffuse ionized gas at @xmath59 k , shock heated by either supernovae or stellar winds , in some galaxies ; this gas can have expansion velocities @xmath60 km / s after @xmath61 yrs ( spitzer 1990 ) .",
    "such gas has been conjectured to contribute as much as @xmath62 of the line emission in some star - forming galaxies and can propagate to scale - heights ( @xmath63 kpc ) above the galaxy disk forming `` galactic fountains '' of gas .",
    "as already noted , velocity shifts of 100 km / s between optical emission line galaxies and 21 cm observations of the neutral gas component have been found in ultra ",
    "luminous dusty iras galaxies ( mirabel & sanders 1988 ) . in these systems",
    "the effect is explained in terms of line - emitting gas moving radially outward in the central regions of such galaxies .",
    "the presence of large quantities of dust , mixed with the gas , provides the necessary attenuation of the emission from the far side of the galaxy .    in the esp survey",
    "we can only identify a handful of seyferts and since the survey is a complete optically selected sample , the velocity bias should be a more common feature of the overall galaxy population than was previously thought and not simply confined to extragalactic objects with exotic properties .",
    "this could be related to a steady increase in the amount of turbulent gas within galaxies with look  back time .",
    "radial motions of gas could have a significant role to play in galaxy evolution and may well provide a new probe of the early history of galaxies . on the other hand , at a fainter limiting apparent magnitude the fraction of intrinsically faint galaxies can increase due to evolution , and one could alternatively imagine that a population of dwarf , star  forming galaxies is responsible for the effect .",
    "the fact that the @xmath64 may be larger at brighter absolute magnitudes and redshifts ( see table [ tab : app ] for the esp and table [ tab : surveys ] for a comparison with other surveys ) might be more consistent with an evolution with redshift .",
    "we have discussed in detail the errors associated to redshift determinations in the eso slice project ( vettolani et al .",
    "1997 ) . we have found a systematic difference between absorption and emission line velocities of @xmath65 km / s and we have shown that the same effect is present in the durham / anglo  australian telescope faint galaxy redshift survey ( broadhurst et al.1988 ) . in the case of the esp , we have excluded problems of zero  point error or calibration . such a discrepancy has not been detected in large shallower surveys .",
    "shectman et al . (",
    "1996 ) briefly discuss a similar effect for the las campanas redshift survey , which they have corrected by using a different template for emission line galaxies .",
    "we have generalized the suggestion by shectman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , who identify as the main cause of the discrepancy the systematic difference between the absorption line spectra of the standard templates and the typical emission line galaxy , particularly the blend between the ca ii @xmath7 and @xmath66 lines , an effect already discussed by sandage ( 1978 ) .",
    "we find in fact systematic effects even from template to template , apparently due to the way each template fits the galaxy spectra ; this implies that the choice of the template significantly affects redshift measurements .    for the esp data",
    ", we decided to use the best ",
    "fit template ( i.e. the one giving the smallest error ) , as using a different template might introduce unknown biases in the redshift measurement .    in the lack of a definitive explanation ,",
    "the common assumption that the true galaxy redshift is given  on average  by the emission lines , is plausible , but not proven .",
    "it should be verified that the bias can not be due , at least partially , to emission lines , and that the sample is not biased , for some reason , towards galaxies with outflows .",
    "one can for example speculate that other factors may contribute to the effect , such as sampling of different parts of the galaxies , the different mix of morphological types , and evolution with look  back time .",
    "a collection of high resolution data of a sample of galaxies and of different templates will be necessary to give a definitive solution .",
    "we feel it is important to stress the existence of such an  anomaly \" : in view of future , large surveys , the templates used should be carefully checked and made publicly availablecappi / esokp.html ] , as already done by the lcrs group , to discover and quantify any systematic difference . even if the amplitude of the effect is not large , it is quantitatively more important that typical zero  point shifts , and it is significant enough to affect for example measures of velocity dispersions and galaxy peculiar velocities , or the interpretation of results for very distant galaxies , as those which are reported by cowie et al .",

    "lin provided us with the 3 templates used for cross  correlating lcrs spectra .",
