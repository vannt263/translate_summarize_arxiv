    "the quest for room temperature ferromagnetic semiconductors that can be matched to conventional semiconductors resulted in an increasing interest in a@xmath1b@xmath2c@xmath3 as well as in a@xmath4b@xmath5c@xmath6 chalcopyrites@xcite .",

    "the @xmath8 ratio can be different from its ideal value 2 and also the anion which lies in the middle of a tetrahedron can slide along the central axis . in this paper , we present a detailed study of a tight - binding calculation that includes the influence that both distortions have on the bulk electronic band structure of cuinse@xmath0 .",
    "it is straightforward to generalize this work to calculate their influence in the whole series of cu - based chalcopyrites .",
    "the final result is a set of hamiltonians precise enough for the whole series that allow to study different surfaces , monolayers and interfaces of these materials in more complicated systems and situations of current interest with a very simple method .",

    "we use the same hamiltonian described above with the same basis on each atom and introduce the changes that describe the corresponding distortions .",
    "we can use the same symmetry group to construct the hamiltonian since x - ray experiments indicate that the space group is preserved @xcite in spite of the distortions present . in this case the se - atom ( the anion ) will have its first nearest neighbors ( the cations ) at different distances .",

    ", we can say that in several aspects the result including the distortions agrees better with the jz calculation .",
    "the first think to notice is that since the space group remains the same , the degeneracies at the high symmetry points @xmath96 , @xmath54 , and @xmath98  also remain as it is to be expected . on the other hand , we see that the distortions have a mayor or minor effect on almost all the bands .",
    "distortion diminishes the optical gap and as a consequence we get 0.95 ev in closer agreement with the 0.98 ev of jz .",

    "the next mvb appears to be still a very narrow band from the d - cu orbitals mainly .",
