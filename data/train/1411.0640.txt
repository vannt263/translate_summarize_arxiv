    "figure 2 shows that the field lines are continuous through the transition from constant velocity motion to accelerated motion .",
    "as the field lines pass through the spherical surface between the accelerated and the constant velocity motion , the normal component of @xmath50 is continuous , and gauss s law is satisfied at the surface .",

    "( [ lw ] ) , where the discontinuity in the acceleration does not affect the radial component ( @xmath56 ) of the retarded field .",

    "an electric field does not usually have a kink in its field lines .",
    "this is because maxwell s equation @xmath57 usually requires that the transverse component of e be continuous as a field line crosses a surface .",

    "the integral is zero if @xmath61 is finite , but in the present case @xmath61 is infinite because the acceleration is discontinuous . if we write the electric field @xmath50 in terms of its constant velocity and acceleration parts as @xmath62 , then @xmath63 has a delta function part , given by @xmath64 , so the integral equals @xmath65 , which is just the discontinuity in the transverse component of @xmath50 .",
    "the break in the direction of the field lines in fig .",
    "3 is seen to be more extreme than that in fig .  2 , but the normal component of @xmath50 is still continuous , and the discontinuity in @xmath50 transverse is still compensated by the discontinuity in @xmath66 .",
    "in contrast to our fig .  3 , the corresponding fig .",
    "4 in @xcite is particularly unusual .",
    "that figure shows no relation between the constant velocity motion and the ensuing accelerated motion .",
    "a  connecting field \" was introduced to somehow close the gap between these disconnected field lines .",
    "but the connecting field has no physical basis for this case .",
    "figure 4 has a very early transition time , @xmath67 , and shows field lines that look like fig .  1 for positive @xmath68 , but seem to be approaching a delta function near @xmath7 . the sequence of figures 2 , 3 , and 4 is seen to be progressing from an almost normal electric field to a combination of the field of fig .  1 with the addition of a delta function along the z - axis",
    "we can tell that the field lines are approaching a delta function along the z - axis for large negative transition times by looking at eq .",
