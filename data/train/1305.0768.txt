    "in this article we focus on the formulation , interpretation , and simulation of a few representative examples of kinetic exchange models . other social science applications of kinetic exchange models are also summarized .",
    "we introduce the general structure of a kinetic exchange model by a simple example . it is assumed that the @xmath1 ( minimally ) interacting units @xmath2 , with @xmath3 , are molecules of a gas with no interaction energy and the variables @xmath4 represent their kinetic energies , such that @xmath5 .",
