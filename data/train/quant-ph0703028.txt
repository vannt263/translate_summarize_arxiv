    "quantum information science provides fruitful connections between different branches of physics . in this context , the relationship between entanglement , which is a fundamental resource for quantum information applications  @xcite , and the theory of quantum critical phenomena  @xcite has been a focus of intensive research .",
    "specifically , entanglement measures have been proposed as a tool to characterize quantum phase transitions ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in this direction ,",
    "a successful approach has been the analysis of bipartite entanglement in quantum systems as measured by the von neumann entropy . given a quantum system in a pure state @xmath3 and a bipartition of the system into two blocks @xmath4 and @xmath5 , entanglement between @xmath4 and @xmath5",
    "can be measured by the von neumann entropy @xmath6 of the reduced density matrix of either block , i.e. , @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the reduced density matrices of blocks @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , with @xmath10 . by evaluating @xmath6 for quantum spin systems , ref .",
    "@xcite numerically found that entanglement displays a logarithmic scaling with the size of the block in critical ( gapless ) chains and saturates to a constant value in chains with a gap for excitations .",
    "the logarithmic scaling was proven in general for one - dimensional quantum models exhibiting conformal invariance  @xcite , with the scaling governed by a universal factor , given by the central charge of the associated conformal field theory .",
    "indeed , for a block of spins of length @xmath11 in a quantum chain , von neumann entropy @xmath12 scales as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the central charge and @xmath15 is a non - universal constant . recently ,",
    "the behavior of entanglement entropy in critical spin chains has also been discussed in presence of disorder  @xcite .",
    "disorder appears as an essential feature in a number of condensed matter systems , motivating a great deal of theoretical and experimental research ( e.g. , see  @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , disorder usually introduces a further effect , namely , the breaking of conformal symmetry in a critical model .",
    "remarkably , refael and moore  @xcite have shown that , even in the absence of conformal invariance , due to disorder , the logarithmic scaling given by eq .",
    "( [ scalingordered ] ) holds for the spin-1/2 random exchange heisenberg antiferromagntic chain ( rehac ) and for the griffiths phase of the random transverse field ising chain . in this case , however , it is governed by an effective central charge @xmath16 . for the pure , i.e. , with no disorder , antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 heisenberg chain , which presents conformal invariance with a central charge @xmath17 , any amount of disorder drives the ground state of this system to the so - called random singlet phase ( rsp ) .",
    "this is a gapless phase with broken conformal symmetry characterized by a collection of singlet pairs of spins randomly distributed throughout the chain . a schematic view of the rsp is displayed in fig .",
    "the rsp appears not only for spin-1/2 chains , but also for higher spin disordered chains . in the case of integer spin chains ,",
    "the rsp will usually arise whenever disorder is strong enough to close the haldane gap . from the point of view of quantum information applications ,",
    "the rsp is potentially useful for implementing quantum channels with nearly perfect communication fidelity , since it exhibits pairs of distant spins in highly entangled states  @xcite .    one important open question for understanding the behavior of entanglement in random quantum chains concerns how general the logarithmic scaling of the von neumann entropy is in these systems . in this context",
    ", the rsp constitutes a rather interesting and universal disordered ground state , appearing in a number of half - integer and integer spin chains . in this letter",
    ", we investigate the scaling of entanglement in the rsp of arbitrary spin-@xmath0 chains .",
    "we find the logarithmic scaling holds in general and furthermore it is associated with an _ effective central charge _ @xmath18 which depends only on the value of the spins in the chain .",
    "these conclusions apply even if the pure chain , i.e. , with no disorder is described by a non - conformal theory .",
    "renormalization group calculations presented here fully support our results .",
    "renormalization group techniques provide a convenient framework for the conceptualization of the quantum phases of random spin chains . as concerns the rsp",
    ", it was first obtained using a perturbative real - space renormalization group method introduced by ma , dasgupta and hu ( mdh )  @xcite to treat the spin-1/2 rehac .",
    "this approach was proven to be asymptotically exact , which allowed for a fully characterization of the properties of the rsp  @xcite .",
    "consider a chain of spins described by the heisenberg hamiltonian @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a set of spin-1/2 operators and @xmath21 is a positive random variable obeying some probability distribution @xmath22 .",
    "the original mdh method consists in finding the strongest interaction @xmath23 between a pair of spins ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 in fig .",
    "2a ) and treating the couplings of this pair with its neighbors ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 in fig .",
    "2a ) as a perturbation .",
    "the singlet formed by the spins coupled by the strongest bond @xmath23 is decimated away and an effective interaction @xmath28 is perturbatively evaluated . by iteratively applying this procedure , the low - energy behavior of the ground state is obtained as a collection of singlet pairs formed over arbitrary distances . this rsp is pictorially displayed in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] .    unfortunately , when generalized to higher spins , this method , at least in its simplest version , revealed to be ineffective .",
    "the reason is that , after the elimination procedure of the strongest bond @xmath23 , the effective interaction @xmath29 may be greater than @xmath23 .",
    "then , the problem becomes essentially non - perturbative for arbitrary distributions of exchange interactions .",
    "for instance , considering an arbitrary spin-@xmath0 rehac , the renormalized coupling is given by the recursive relation  @xcite @xmath30 notice that , for @xmath31 , the renormalization factor is @xmath32 , resulting in a possible breakdown of perturbation theory depending on the values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 . in order to solve this problem ,",
    "a generalization of the mdh method was proposed in refs .",
    "this modified mdh method consists in either of the following procedures shown in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] . taking the case of the heisenberg chain as an example ,",
    "if the largest neighboring interaction to @xmath23 , say @xmath26 , is @xmath33 , then we eliminate the strongest coupled pair obtaining an effective interaction between the neighbors to this pair which is given by eq .",
    "( [ jprimeh ] ) ( see fig .",
    "this new effective interaction is always smaller than those eliminated .",
    "now suppose @xmath34 and @xmath35 . in this case , using eq .",
    "( [ jprimeh ] ) would give rise to an interaction larger then those eliminated . in order to avoid that",
    ", we consider the _ trio _ of spins-@xmath0 coupled by the two strongest interactions of the trio , @xmath26 and @xmath23 and solve it exactly ( see fig .",
    "2b ) . the trio of spins is then substituted by one effective spin - s interacting with its neighbors through new renormalized interactions obtained by degenerate perturbation theory for the ground state of the trio .",
    "this method has been successfully applied to investigate the quantum phase diagram of the spin-1  @xcite and spin-3/2  @xcite rehacs .",
    "as we show below , it turns out to be also essential for the computation of block entanglement in high spin chains .",
    "let us consider the general structure of the rsp shown schematically in fig .",
    "the ground state of the system consists of pairs of spins coupled into singlets over arbitrary distances .",
    "these can be represented at zeroth order by the tensor product @xmath36 , where @xmath37 denotes the singlet state @xmath38 for spins at arbitrary distant sites labelled by integer numbers @xmath39 and @xmath40 . in order to evaluate entanglement",
    ", we then observe that von neumann entropy of a tensor product @xmath41 for density matrices @xmath42 and @xmath43 is simply @xmath44  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the entanglement entropy of a block of length @xmath11 can be obtained by counting singlet pairs which cross the boundary of the block .",
    "this yields @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the entanglement entropy of a pair of spins and @xmath47 is the configurational average of the number of singlets connecting the two blocks . for a pair of spin-@xmath0 particles in a singlet state , von neumann entropy of the pair",
    "is maximal and given by @xmath48 .",
    "concerning @xmath47 , it has been evaluated analytically for the spin-1/2 random heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain in ref .",
    "@xcite via counting of singlets from the explicit solution of the renormalization group flow equation for the distribution of couplings .",
    "the value obtained for @xmath47 reads @xmath49 with @xmath15 a non - universal constant .",
    "although eq .",
    "( [ n ] ) was derived for the specific case of spin-1/2 , it should actually hold for any spin-@xmath0 chain in the rsp .",
    "the reason is that the average number of singlet pairs should be the same for any ground state which is a completely random collection of singlets along the chain .",
    "indeed , @xmath47 is a number which should be a general property of the structure of the rsp , being independent of the magnitude @xmath0 of the spins composing the chain .",
    "therefore , by inserting eq .",
    "( [ n ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ entangaverage ] ) , we obtain for any random quantum spin-@xmath0 chain in the rsp the following relationship : @xmath50 where @xmath51 notice that @xmath52 depends only on the value of @xmath0 , which is therefore the key object to set the effective central charge of random spin chains in the rsp . notice that eq .",
    "( [ cr ] ) does not involve any central charge of pure ( non - disordered ) models , since we do not have a central charge associated with integer spin chains exhibiting a haldane gap .",
    "let us turn now to the explicit evaluation of entanglement entropy for the spin-@xmath1 and spin-@xmath2 rehacs via numerical implementation of the renormalization group equations .",
    "as it will be seen in the next sections , this will provide a full support to our scaling law for @xmath12 .",
    "we apply now the generalized mdh method to discuss entanglement in the spin-1 and spin-3/2 heisenberg chains .",
    "the hamiltonian for these chains will be given by eq .",
    "( [ hh ] ) , but with the set @xmath20 denoting now spin-1 and spin-3/2 operators , respectively .",
    "decimation of the chain follows the procedure previously described , with the renormalized couplings given by eq .",
    "( [ jprimeh ] ) .",
    "then , block entanglement can be numerically computed in the following way .",
    "if a singlet is decimated and the spins composing the singlet are in different blocks , this singlet adds @xmath53 to the von neumann entropy .",
    "on the other hand , in the case of a _ trio _ elimination , we have seen that one effective spin is returned to the chain .",
    "then , if the spins composing the _ trio _ are in different blocks , the effective spin is introduced , by a majority vote strategy , in the block contributing with more spins to the _ trio _ , such that , each block contributes with one spin for the elimination process . at the time",
    "the effective spin forms a singlet with another spin ( either effective or not ) , entanglement will then be counted as in the singlet case previously described .",
    "hence , notice that von neumann entropy is counted only when a singlet decimation occurs .",
    "this is somewhat similar to the procedure adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite for the transverse field ising model , where entanglement was counted only for effective spins decimated by the transverse field . in our numerical procedure ,",
    "we averaged entanglement over 1000 random coupling configurations following a power - law probability distribution of couplings @xmath54 given by @xmath55 , for which , _ trio _ renormalizations are in a negligible number in the rsp . numerical analysis of entanglement as a function of the length of the block is plotted in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] , where we considered blocks of spins up to 10000 sites in a chain initially with 200000 sites .",
    "notice that : ( i ) block entanglement scales logarithmically with the length @xmath11 of the block ; ( ii ) the logarithmic scaling follows our eq .",
    "( [ scalingrandom ] ) , with @xmath56 for spin-1 and @xmath57 for spin-3/2 .",
    "the case of spin-1 is particularly remarkable , since the scaling is governed by an effective central charge although the model does not exhibit conformal invariance even in the limit of vanishing disorder .",
    "as shown by eq .",
    "( [ cr ] ) , scaling in the rsp depends only on the magnitude of the spins composing the chain , being independent of the particular properties of the model .",
    "indeed , this can be illustrated by considering the spin-1 biquadratic chain , whose hamiltonian is given by @xmath58 where @xmath20 is a set of spin-1 operators and @xmath59 is a positive random variable obeying some probability distribution @xmath22 .",
    "application of the generalized mdh procedure here results only in the formation of singlets , with the renormalized exchange coupling reading  @xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the neighbors to the strongest bond .",
    "notice that _ trio _ renormalizations are completely absent here , since the renormalized couplings generated are always smaller than the energy scale @xmath23 .",
    "similar behavior occurs for the spin-1/2 heisenberg chain , with @xmath63 and , therefore , the original mdh method can be straightforwardly applied . in this simpler situation ,",
    "entanglement between a block of length @xmath11 and the rest of the chain can be computed by exclusively singlet renormalizations ( there is no possibility of _ trio _ renormalizations ) .",
    "block entanglements for both the biquadratic spin-1 chain and the spin-1/2 heisenberg chain are shown in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] . as before , we considered blocks of spins up to 10000 sites in a chain initially with 200000 sites , with entanglement averaged over 1000 random coupling configurations following a power - law probability distribution of couplings @xmath54 given by @xmath55 .",
    "for the spin-1/2 heisenberg chain , the result for the scaling is in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite and reproduces eq .",
    "( [ entangaverage ] ) .",
    "moreover , observe that both the spin-1 rehac in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] and the random biquadratic chain exhibit the same _ effective central charge _",
    "@xmath52 , in complete agreement with eq .",
    "( [ cr ] ) .",
    "in summary , we have characterized the logarithmic scaling of entanglement entropy in the rsp of random quantum chains of general spin-@xmath0 . in particular , we have shown that an _ effective central charge _ governing the scaling can be defined , which depends exclusively on the magnitude @xmath0 of the spin , as given by eq .",
    "( [ cr ] ) . in order to give support to these conclusions , we evaluated entanglement for different spin-1 and spin-3/2 chains using a real space renormalization group approach .",
    "these results are encouraging for the pursuit of a complete characterization of entanglement entropy in general random critical spin-@xmath0 chains .",
    "in particular , characterization of the complete phase diagram , i.e. , for different degrees of disorder of spin-1 and spin-3/2 rehacs , is challenging .",
    "this topic is left for a future investigation .",
