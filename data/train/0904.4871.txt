    "in this paper , a real - valued lvy process is studied .",
    "the problem of existence of a partial right inverse ( pri ) is considered and an explicit integral criterion is provided for testing whether any lvy process possesses a pri .    we continue work by evans @xcite and winkel @xcite .",
    "evans has introduced the notion of a full right inverse and has defined this process @xmath5 as the minimal increasing process that satisfies @xmath6 for all @xmath7 ; winkel , in @xcite , has extended this definition to @xmath8 on some random interval @xmath4 of positive length and has named this process a pri . in these two papers , it is shown that if @xmath5 exists , it is a ( possibly killed ) subordinator .",
    "a lvy process @xmath9 is a stochastic process which possesses stationary and independent increments , starts from zero and whose paths are a.s .",
    "right - continuous .",
    "each lvy process is fully characterized by its lvy triplet @xmath10 , where @xmath11 , @xmath12 and the lvy measure @xmath13 has the property @xmath14 also , each lvy process @xmath1 can be represented as follows : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a standard brownian motion , @xmath17 is a pure jump zero mean martingale and all of the components in ( [ dec ] ) are independent . in the class of lvy processes ,",
    "we distinguish between lvy processes with bounded variation and lvy processes with unbounded variation .",
    "the former are those for which @xmath18 and @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the drift coefficient and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are independent driftless subordinators ( i.e. , increasing lvy processes ) . in our setting , as well as in many other situations ,",
    "these two classes of processes exhibit quite different behaviors and need separate attention .",
    "we write @xmath23 .",
    "it is shown in @xcite , chapter 6 , that @xmath24 is a strong markov process which possesses a local time at zero , @xmath25 , and a corresponding inverse local time @xmath26 such that @xmath27 is a bivariate subordinator : we denote its lvy measure by @xmath28 and we use , in particular , @xmath29 .",
    "we also use the notation @xmath30 and call @xmath31 the _ upward ladder height process_. similarly , we can define @xmath32 and , using the same arguments , we have an associated inverse local time @xmath33 and _ downward ladder height process _",
    "we denote the lvy measure of @xmath35 by @xmath36 . finally , with each of the subordinators @xmath31and @xmath35 , we associate the so - called _ renewal measure _ ,",
    "defined as follows : @xmath37 we refer to bertoin @xcite or doney @xcite for more information on lvy processes .",
    "next , we briefly discuss the definition of a pri , that is , @xmath38 .",
    "we follow an approach developed in evans @xcite .",
    "define , for each @xmath39 and @xmath40 , the stopping times @xmath41 and processes @xmath42",
    "a pathwise argument then shows that @xmath43 it is possible that for each @xmath44 , the definition above gives @xmath45 and , in this case , we say that a pri does not exist .",
    "the question of the existence of a pri has been studied by evans in se and winkel in @xcite .",
    "evans has shown that for any symmetric lvy process with @xmath46 , a full right - inverse exists .",
    "winkel @xcite then showed that the same result holds for any oscillating lvy process with @xmath46 and also described all lvy processes with bounded variation having a pri .",
    "moreover , in the unbounded variation case , he provided a necessary and sufficient condition ( nasc ) for the existence of a pri , but this nasc is not satisfactory since it requires knowledge about the second derivative at zero of the so - called of the given lvy process , which are generally unknown .",
    "therefore , the main aim of this paper is to supply an nasc for the existence of a pri in terms of the lvy triplet , that is , @xmath10 , in the unbounded variation case .",
    "in fact , our method , which is probabilistic in nature , also deals with the bounded variation case and gives the following result .",
    "[ t ] let @xmath1 be a lvy process with a lvy measure @xmath13 such that @xmath47 . then :    if @xmath1 has unbounded variation , it has a partial right inverse ( pri ) iff @xmath46 or @xmath18 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , where , with @xmath50 , @xmath51    if @xmath1 has bounded variation , then it has a pri iff @xmath52 and @xmath1 has a drift coefficient @xmath53 .    if @xmath54 , then @xmath55 is a continuous process and @xmath56 will be a pri on the set @xmath57 .",
    "note that , in this case , @xmath58 will be the empty set iff @xmath18 and @xmath59 .",
    "a lvy process @xmath1 is said to `` creep upward '' if @xmath60 for some ( and then all ) @xmath44 , where @xmath61 .",
    "it is known that this happens iff the ladder height process @xmath31 has drift @xmath62 ; see , for example , theorem 19 , page 174 of @xcite . since it is always the case that @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the drift of @xmath65 , this certainly happens when @xmath46 . if @xmath18 and @xmath66 , then the integral @xmath67 is clearly finite and it is shown in @xcite that this is the nasc for @xmath68 in the unbounded variation case when @xmath18 .",
    "( see also section 6.4 of @xcite for an alternative proof of this result . ) finally , in the bounded variation case , @xmath53 is clearly equivalent to @xmath69 .",
    "we therefore conclude that our theorem is consistent with the intuitively obvious claim that `` upward creeping '' is necessary , but not sufficient , for the existence of a pri .",
    "the next corollary illustrates how our theorem yields specific information in special cases . here , and throughout the paper",
    ", we use the notation @xmath70 to denote the existence of constants @xmath71 with @xmath72 , for all sufficiently small @xmath3 .",
    "[ co]let @xmath1 be a lvy process with @xmath18 and lvy measure @xmath13 such that @xmath73 and @xmath74 , where @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "then @xmath1 has a pri iff @xmath77 .",
    "this result extends proposition 2 and theorem 6 in @xcite .",
    "recall that we denote by @xmath31 the ascending ladder height process of a given lvy process @xmath1 .",
    "we use @xmath78 to denote the drift of @xmath79 and @xmath80 to denote its lvy measure .",
    "we also use @xmath81 and @xmath82 , which are defined in ( [ ren ] ) .",
    "we start the proof by disposing of some special cases .",
    "suppose , first , that @xmath83 . then @xmath84 a.s .",
    "since it is an exponentially distributed random variable with parameter @xmath85 and the given process coincides up to time @xmath86 with the process we get by removing all of its jumps .",
    "the resulting process will be of the form @xmath87 , which possesses a pri iff @xmath46 or @xmath18 and @xmath53 , in accordance with theorem [ t ] .",
    "next , suppose that @xmath88 , but @xmath89 . removing all the positive jumps then gives a spectrally negative lvy process @xmath90 . if @xmath90 has unbounded variation , or has bounded variation and a positive drift @xmath20 , then it passes continuously over positive levels . then with @xmath91 , we obviously have @xmath92 on @xmath93 and we can choose @xmath94 .",
    "alternatively , @xmath90 has bounded variation and a drift @xmath95 , and , clearly , no pri exists for @xmath90 or @xmath1 in this case . noting that in the unbounded variation case , we have @xmath96 so that ,",
    "necessarily , @xmath49 , we see that these results also accord with theorem [ t ] .",
    "next , suppose that @xmath97 , but @xmath98 .",
    "if @xmath1 has bounded variation , then removing all of the negative jumps gives us a spectrally positive process of the form @xmath99 , where @xmath21 is a driftless subordinator . if @xmath100 , then @xmath90 has monotone paths and the assumption that @xmath101 implies the existence of points @xmath102 with @xmath103 , which verifies theorem [ t ] in this case . finally , if @xmath104 or if @xmath1 has unbounded variation , then the decreasing ladder height process is a pure drift , possibly killed at an exponential time , and we see that the hypothesis of proposition [ a ] below holds .",
    "the rest of our proof uses the following simple consequence of the construction of @xmath5 due to evans @xcite .",
    "[ o]let @xmath1 be an arbitrary lvy process , and set @xmath105 and @xmath106 does not visit @xmath107 . then :    a pri exists for @xmath1 if@xmath108    no pri exists for @xmath1 if @xmath109    first , note that the sequence @xmath110 , @xmath111 , where @xmath112 are defined in ( [ k ] ) , is monotone increasing . if we denote its limit by @xmath113 , then it is immediate from ( [ ev ] ) that @xmath114 .",
    "since we know that @xmath5 is a ( possibly killed ) subordinator , we see that existence of a pri for @xmath1 is equivalent to @xmath115 .",
    "however , this is equivalent to @xmath116 for some ( and then all ) @xmath117 . since @xmath118 is the sum of @xmath119 independent random variables distributed as @xmath120 , we have @xmath121 and this is clearly finite for any @xmath122 for which ( [ b ] ) holds . since @xmath123",
    ", we see that this limit is @xmath124 for all @xmath117 whenever ( [ c ] ) holds , and the result follows .    the crux of our proof is contained in the following result , in which @xmath125 for @xmath44 .",
    "[ a ] let @xmath1 be a lvy process having @xmath126 and @xmath127 for all small enough @xmath44 .",
    "then @xmath1 has a pri iff @xmath68 and @xmath128 , where @xmath129    since the existence of a pri is a local property , we can truncate the lvy measure so that it is contained in @xmath130 $ ] .",
    "indeed , the first jump of @xmath1 larger than @xmath131 in absolute value occurs after an exponential time @xmath132 and @xmath0 is a subordinator , therefore @xmath133 pathwise for all @xmath3 small enough .",
    "this shows that the existence of @xmath5 is independent of the large jumps , so we will assume , without loss of generality , that @xmath134))=0 $ ] .",
    "moreover , the value of @xmath78 is also a local property , so this is also unchanged by any alteration of the lvy measure on closed intervals which do not contain 0 .",
    "note that our assumptions imply that @xmath135 and that these alterations do not change the finiteness / infiniteness of @xmath136 .",
    "let us introduce some notation . for @xmath44",
    ", we put @xmath137 and @xmath138 for the first passage times above @xmath3 and below @xmath139 , respectively , and @xmath140 , @xmath141 for the overshoot above @xmath3 and the undershoot below @xmath139 , respectively .",
    "noting that @xmath142 is also the overshoot of @xmath31 above @xmath3 , we can use proposition 2 , page 76 in @xcite to deduce that for @xmath44 , @xmath143,@xmath144\\\\[-8pt ] & \\leq&\\overline{\\mu}^{(+)}(y)u_{+}(x).\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to prove the result in one direction , we alter the lvy measure by adding a mass at @xmath145 , if necessary , to make @xmath1 drift to @xmath146 .",
    "we then have the estimate@xmath147 where the fact that @xmath148 comes from proposition 17 , page 172 of @xcite .",
    "[ it is obvious that , in fact , @xmath149 since @xmath150 as @xmath151 . ] from ( [ bound ] ) , it then follows that@xmath152 finally , we recall from proposition 1 , page 74 in @xcite that @xmath153 so that @xmath154 as @xmath155 , and thus ( [ c ] ) holds and no pri exists , whenever @xmath156 , or @xmath157 and @xmath158 . to argue in the other direction ,",
    "we assume that @xmath62 and @xmath128 .",
    "then , without loss of generality , we can take @xmath159 .",
    "next , we denote by @xmath160 the law of this process killed at an independent exponential time @xmath161 with parameter @xmath122 and note that @xmath162 our aim is to show that there exists some @xmath163 such that @xmath164 since then the existence of a pri for @xmath1 will follow from lemma [ o ] .",
    "we decompose @xmath165 according to the number of upcrossings and downcrossings of level @xmath3 that occur .",
    "to do so , we denote by @xmath166 the time of @xmath167th crossing above @xmath3 , by @xmath168 the time of @xmath167th crossing below @xmath3 and for @xmath111 , we put @xmath169 since @xmath1 creeps upward , it is then easy to see that@xmath170 we start by noting that @xmath171 and @xmath172 is the renewal function of the ladder height process @xmath31 under @xmath160 .",
    "of course , under @xmath160 , @xmath31 is killed at some rate @xmath173 and has lvy measure @xmath174 . however , as we have mentioned , its drift is unchanged and equals @xmath131 . using a version of erickson s bound for killed subordinators , which can be found in @xcite , we therefore have @xmath175 where @xmath176 is an absolute constant .",
    "also , @xmath177 and this gives the bound@xmath178 next , using a similar notation , we see that @xmath179 where we have used the @xmath160 version of ( [ bound ] ) . using ( er ) again gives the bound @xmath180 writing @xmath181 for the successive overshoots upward and downward over level  @xmath3 , we then have @xmath182 also , wald s identity gives @xmath183 , where @xmath184 , and so we have@xmath185 where we have again used ( [ bound ] ) .",
    "iterating this gives @xmath186 where @xmath187 , and thus@xmath188 moreover , using ( [ zero ] ) and ( [ e ] ) , we get the bound@xmath189 so , ( [ lim ] ) will follow , provided that @xmath122 can be chosen such that @xmath190 to see this , we need to note first that @xmath191 . also , provided that @xmath192 , by applying bound ( [ er ] ) to @xmath35 , we get @xmath193 for each @xmath194 $ ] as @xmath195 , and since @xmath196 and @xmath128 , dominated convergence will give @xmath197 to see that @xmath192 , note that the killing time of @xmath35 under @xmath160 is the same as that of the ladder time subordinator @xmath198 and this has the distribution of @xmath199 , which is exp(@xmath200 , where @xmath201 is the laplace exponent of @xmath202 under @xmath203 . the assumption that @xmath127 for all small @xmath44 implies that @xmath202 is not a compound poisson process so , by corollary 3 , page 17 of @xcite , @xmath204 and , thus , if we choose @xmath122 large enough , ( [ claim ] ) will hold and the proof is complete .",

    "it is clear that excursions away from 0 of @xmath253 evolve in the same way as excursions away from 0 of @xmath1 , namely , they have the same semigroup , but their entrance laws will be different .",
    "for example , if @xmath255 , then all excursions of @xmath253 are negative and the characteristic measure @xmath256 is @xmath257 restricted to negative excursion paths .",
    "winkel showed that when @xmath46 , @xmath256 is the restriction of @xmath257 to the set of excursion paths which _ start _ negative .",

    "when @xmath18 and @xmath69 , we have @xmath260 , which means that excursions of @xmath1 have to return to 0 from below . by time reversal , this means that they must start positive and since excursions of @xmath261 start negative , the two measures must be mutually singular whenever @xmath262 .",
