    "deformed quantum field theories have been subject to renewed attention in recent years due to their natural appearance in string theory .",

    "even more recently , non - anticommutative theories in two dimensions have been constructed@xcite , and their one - loop divergences computed@xcite . in ref .  @xcite we returned to a closer examination of the non - anticommutative wess - zumino model ( with a superpotential ) in four dimensions , and showed that to obtain correct results for the theory where the auxiliary fields have been eliminated , from the corresponding results for the uneliminated theory ,",

    "the problem is that the potential part of the classical action contains terms with different combinations of @xmath8 and @xmath7 chiral fields which mix under @xmath0 supersymmetry , but for which the yukawa couplings renormalise differently , at least in the simplest version of the theory .",
    "however , recently an elegant solution to this problem has been proposed@xcite in which the kinetic terms for the @xmath7 chiral fields are modified , in such a way that the @xmath8 and @xmath7 chiral fields ( and consequently their yukawa couplings ) renormalise in exactly the same way .",
