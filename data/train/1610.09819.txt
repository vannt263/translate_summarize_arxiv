    "of all the forces in nature , the gravitational force has proven to be the most resistant to being incorporated into a common framework that would unify all possible interactions . whereas the electromagnetic , weak and strong interactions have all been successfully described by gauge field theories , gravity is accurately described by einstein s general theory of relativity , a mathematical theory based on tensors rather than on four - vectors .",
    "an intrinsic difference arises regarding the spin of the fundamental degrees of freedom in each case : while all gauge bosons have spin one , gravitons have spin two ; this inevitably affects the type of symmetry present in each theory , and eventually determines the mathematical framework that describes it best .    at the same time , gravity could not be more similar to electromagnetism ( em ) at the classical level .",
    "the similarity of the equations obeyed by the newtonian and coulomb potential was noticed centuries ago , and this analogy was re - inforced after the discovery of the lense - thirring effect @xcite where the angular momentum of a rotating body may be interpreted at large distances as a gravitational ` magnetic ' field .",
    "all these cultivated the impression that the unification of gravity with electromagnetism would be straightforward and imminent .",
    "numerous attempts have therefore appeared in the literature over a century - long period including the kaluza - klein theory @xcite , the string and m - theory @xcite@xcite , the loop quantum gravity @xcite , as well as a number of other geometric theories , classical or quantum , that have attempted to connect gravity and electromagnetism @xcite@xcite ( for a more extensive list of references including even earlier works , see @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "so far , the construction of a robust mathematical or geometrical theory , in the context of which the unification of all forces could be realised , is still missing .",
    "a different approach , that has attracted considerable attention over the years , is the one adopted in the theory of gravito - electromagnetism ( gem ) @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite . in this , the dynamics of the gravitational field is described in terms of quantities met in electromagnetism .",
    "the mathematical framework of gem is that of the general theory of relativity , and more specifically , the perturbed einstein s field equations at linear approximation .",
    "the gravitational perturbations @xmath4 may be expressed in terms of a scalar @xmath1 and a vector potential @xmath0 , that at large distances are associated to the newtonian potential and angular momentum of the source .",
    "the linearised field equations then reduce to a set of equations with a close similarity to maxwell s equations in electromagnetism .",
    "the gem fields @xmath2 and @xmath3 are defined in terms of the gem potentials @xmath1 and @xmath0 in a way similar to the usual electro - magnetic . in the absence of a true unification scheme , the theory of gravito - electromagnetism has provided a new perspective on the description and understanding of the gravitational field ; in addition , it has helped to investigate in depth the analogy between these two fundamental forces , and has guided us to look for gravitational analogues of electromagnetic phenomena in the context of general relativity .    in a previous work of ours @xcite , we performed a comprehensive analysis of the set of equations that follow from the linearised field equations for the so - called traditional ansatz for the metric perturbations employed in gem @xcite .",
    "our results demonstrated that the set of equations for the gem fields reduce to maxwell s equations but only under the assumption of a static vector potential @xmath0 - in fact , the staticity of @xmath0 was dictated by the neglected spatial component of the transverse gauge condition , usually adopted in gem , and was thus an intrinsic feature of the theory .",
    "in addition , we showed that the spatial components of the field equations , that are also often ignored in the literature , carry important pieces of information : at times , they may impose unphysical or over - restrictive constraints to the fields or matter distribution of the theory , and therefore should be properly taken into account .",
    "finally , the exact form of the geodesics equation , that in the context of gem reduces to a form similar to that of the equation for the lorentz force , was derived and showed to contain additional terms that may not be easily ignored , even in the non - relativistic limit , unless the scalar potential @xmath1 is also static .",
    "an important conclusion that followed from the analysis of @xcite was that the form of the gravitational perturbations significantly affects the form of the field equations , the expression for the lorentz force and the form of any additional constraints .",
    "indeed , an alternative ansatz employed in @xcite was shown to have attractive features such as the complete absence of additional constraints or the absence of additional terms in the expression of lorentz force . however , this was of limited physical relevance as the analysis was restricted only to a vacuum configuration . in the present work , motivated by our previous findings ,",
    "we introduce two novel forms of metric perturbations .",
    "the first one is a generalisation of the traditional ansatz employed in gem that allows small but non - vanishing spatial components of the metric perturbations @xmath5 .",
    "although the @xmath6 components are not involved in the derivation of maxwell s equations , due to the tensorial structure of the theory , their absence or presence affects other important equations of the theory .",
    "indeed , we show that the set of maxwell s equations are exactly reproduced , and the presence of all terms involving time - derivatives of the vector potential @xmath0 are now restored .",
    "the second novel form of perturbations combines the attractive features of the first one , the _ generalised traditional ansatz _ , and the one employed in @xcite .",
    "this _ alternative ansatz _ has as its core idea the introduction of the scalar potential @xmath1 into the spatial components @xmath6 , too , of the metric perturbations .",
    "then , a cancellation of potentially harmful terms in the expression of the lorentz force leaves behind a minimal form identical , at first approximation , to that in electromagnetism .",
    "in addition , no unphysical constraints on matter or field configurations arise in the theory , and the set of maxwell s equations is again restored for a dynamical vector potential @xmath0 .",
    "what is also important in establishing the extent of analogy between gravity and em is the construction of scalar invariant quantities in the context of gem similar to those in electromagnetism .",
    "previous attempts have appeared in the literature before @xcite where either the weyl or the riemann tensor is employed for this purpose . here",
    ", we search for scalar quantities defined directly in the context of the linearised gravitational theory of gem . to this end",
    ", we define three novel 3rd - rank gravitational tensors in terms of which we construct scalar quantities , compute their expressions for both ansatzes and evaluate their role as analogues of the scalar quantities of em .",
    "finally , we turn our attention to the gauge invariance of the linearised gravitational theory .",
    "it is well known that this may be interpreted as a gauge invariance of the gem fields @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite . however ,",
    "this has been demonstrated for a particular type of coordinate transformations . in the context of the present analysis",
    ", we perform a comprehensive analysis , and derive the most general constraints that the coordinate transformation should obey in order for the gauge invariance of the gem fields to hold .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows : in section 2 , we present the theoretical framework of our analysis , review the most basic assumptions and equations of gem , and discuss the weak points of the traditional analysis . in section 3 , we present the two novel forms of gravitational perturbations , and in each case we derive the complete set of field equations , gauge condition and geodesics equation .",
    "then , in section 4 , we focus on the construction of scalar quantities in terms of three novel gravitational tensors , and we compute their expressions for both metric ansatzes . in section 5 ,",
    "we address the topic of the gauge invariance , derive the full set of constraints on the coordinate transformations and look for the most general configuration",
    ". finally , we present our conclusions in section 6 .",
    "our theoretical framework will be the one developed in the context of the theory of gravito - electromagnetism ( gem ) , therefore we start our analysis by presenting its basic assumptions and equations @xcite@xcite .",
    "the general metric tensor is assumed to be written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the minkowski metric of the flat spacetime signature for the minkowski tensor @xmath8 . ] and @xmath9 are the metric perturbations .",
    "the latter are functions of @xmath10 and are associated to the presence of gravitating bodies .",
    "they are also assumed to obey the inequality @xmath11 , and therefore a linear - approximation analysis may be followed for their study .    by following a standard procedure @xcite@xcite",
    ", the perturbed einstein s equations take the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "a new form of the metric perturbations , defined through the relation @xcite @xmath16 results into a simpler form of the field equations , namely @xmath17 finally , the energy - momentum tensor is assumed to be described by the expression @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the mass / charge density in the context of gem and @xmath20 is the velocity of the source .    in the context of the traditional ansatz",
    "adopted in gem , the components of the metric perturbations @xmath21 have the form @xcite h_00= , h_0i= , h_ij=(c^-4 ) , [ case1 ] where the scalar @xmath22 and vector @xmath23 functions are the so - called gravito - electromagnetic potentials defined in analogy with electromagnetism . in reality , @xmath1 is the newtonian gravitational potential while @xmath0 is associated to the angular - momentum vector , if existent , of the massive body . the spatial components @xmath6 of the perturbations are assumed to be negligible  due to the suppression of the corresponding source by a @xmath24 factor  and are thus ignored throughout the analysis .",

    "assuming again the ansatz ( [ case1 ] ) for the metric perturbations and neglecting the spatial components @xmath6 , we found that the field equations ( [ einstein_new ] ) take in fact the following forms : ^2=4 g , [ poissongem ] for @xmath39 , and -^2 ( ) = , [ 4maxwellgem ] for @xmath40 .",

    "it is therefore the need for the recovery of the analogy between gem and electromagnetism that demands the staticity of @xmath0 in @xcite and not the imposition _ per s _ of the gauge condition .",
    "nevertheless , there is an underlying connection since the forgotten ( @xmath42)-components of the gauge condition @xmath25 in fact reduce to the constraint @xmath43 that consistently complements the aforementioned requirement of a static vector potential ( the role of this constraint in the context of gem was also studied in @xcitef , @xcitea , g and @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , let us note that , due to the tensorial structure of gravity , the field equations ( [ einstein_new ] ) also yield additional constraints arising from the @xmath44 components , namely @xcite -_t ( _ i a^j + _ j a^i ) + _ ij= u_iu_j .",

    "still , the above expression is an extended one compared to eq .",
    "( [ lorentz - force1 ] ) that appeared in @xcite .",
    "the two additional terms proportional to @xmath52 may be indeed safely ignored in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "however , the additional term proportional to the combination @xmath53 is not equally suppressed and thus should be taken into account  unless the scalar potential is also time - independent , as assumed in @xcite .",
    "but although , in this case , this last term that spoils the analogy with the electromagnetism in the expression of the lorentz force indeed drops out , a new problem arises : through eq .",
    "( [ diagonal - gem ] ) , we are forced to restrict our analysis only either to static distributions of matter ( @xmath54 ) , or in pure vacuum ( @xmath55 ) ; both requirements considerably restrict the physical importance of the achieved analogy with electromagnetism ( for a more extended analysis on the link between the time - independence of the gem potentials and the analogy between gravity and electromagnetism , see @xcite ) .",
    "in the previous section , we have demonstrated that , in the context of the traditional gem ansatz for the metric perturbations , a static vector potential @xmath0 is necessary for the field equations to reduce to a set of maxwell - like equations , and that only for a static scalar potential @xmath1 the form of the lorentz force is restored in the non - relativistic limit . in this section",
    ", we will consider two alternative , more generalised ansatzes for the metric perturbations , and investigate whether these two problems can be simultaneously resolved without the imposition of the time - independence of the gem fields .",

    "we therefore conclude that the time - dependence of the vector gem potential @xmath0 is directly related to the spatial components of the metric perturbations @xmath6 .",

    "in the first case , @xmath6 will again be suppressed by a @xmath24 factor , as in eq .",

    "we extend the traditional form assumed for the metric perturbations in the context of gem @xcite , and write the following generalised form h_00= , h_0i= , h_ij=_ij+d_ij .",

    "this condition is one of the two ( [ cond1-epsilon ] ) assumed when the perfect analogy with the em is sought for .",
    "however , as we saw earlier this leads to a more restrictive form of the vector @xmath158 than it is necessary .",
    "for this reason , above , we have followed instead the option of the introduction of the @xmath64 term that , while not affecting any of our results , helps to keep the space of the symmetry as large as possible . ] .",
    "the inconsistency that has arisen in applying the transformation rule ( [ pert - new - trans ] ) to the case of the alternative ansatz is , we believe , a generic one that appears when an over - simplifying assumption is made for the form of the metric perturbations .",
    "although the problem for the alternative ansatz was fixed quite easily , a more serious consistency problem will be present for ansatzes that are  built \" to be very simple .",
    "for example , one may easily see that the traditional ansatz ( [ case1 ] ) , where the @xmath6 components were altogether ignored , faces a similar problem with different transformation rules for @xmath1 following from the general rule ( [ pert - new - trans ] ) and the trace transformation rule ( [ trace - trans ] ) ; unless one restores the spatial components of the metric perturbations ",
    "an approach that we have consistently followed in this work for a number of additional reasons ",
    "the problem can not be overcome .",
    "the striking similarity between the gravitational and electromagnetic forces at classical level , that was found to hold also in the context of the general theory of relativity , has attracted a lot of attention over a century - long period .",
    "the framework of gravito - electromagnetism , the theory that describes the dynamics of the gravitational field in terms of quantities met in electromagnetism , has also been the area of an intense activity over the years and , provided a new perspective on the description and understanding of the gravitational field .",
    "the modern mathematical framework is that of the general theory of relativity , and more specifically , the perturbed einstein s field equations at linear approximation .",
    "the gravitational perturbations @xmath4 involve directly the gem potentials @xmath1 and @xmath0 , and the field equations then reduce to a set of maxwell - like equations for the gem fields @xmath2 and @xmath3 defined in terms of the potentials in the usual electro - magnetic way . in this , and in a previous work of ours @xcite , we have shown that the choice of the form of the gravitational perturbations is of paramount importance for the successful restoration of maxwell s equations and the validity of the analogy between gravity and em . in section 2 , after reviewing the most basic assumptions and equations of gem , we discussed the weak points of the analysis based on the so - called traditional ansatz ( [ case1 ] ) for the gravitational perturbations @xcite : ( i ) although the maxwell s equations are restored , this is realised only for a static vector potential @xmath0 , ( ii ) the form of the lorentz equation is reproduced but potentially important new terms , not present in em , can be avoided only under the assumption of a static scalar potential @xmath1 , ( iii ) the additional components of the field equations and gauge condition , that were ignored , can impose unphysical or over - restrictive constraints to the fields or matter distribution of the theory .    in the light of the above results , in section 3 , we introduced two novel forms of metric perturbations .",
    "the first one was a generalisation of the traditional ansatz , eq .",
    "( [ case_general ] ) , in the sense that allowed small but non - vanishing spatial components of the metric perturbations @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath6 components are indeed not involved in the derivation of maxwell s equations , and one may easily discard them as irrelevant .",
    "however , due to the tensorial structure of the theory the absence or presence of these quantities affect other important equations of the theory .",
    "thus , in section 3.1 , we explicitly demonstrated that , in the absence of @xmath6 , the additional component of the transverse gauge condition _ demands _ the staticity of the vector potential @xmath0 . on the other hand , in its presence",
    ", important terms , involving time - derivatives of @xmath0 that were previously missing , are now restored , and the set of maxwell s equations are exactly reproduced .",
    "moreover , all additional constraints were rendered harmless , and simply connected the form of the @xmath6 components to the distribution of matter in the theory .",
    "the expression of the lorentz equation , though , still suffered from the presence of additional terms that may not be easily ignored . in search of a new ansatz that could perhaps achieve both objectives at once ,",
    "i.e. restore maxwell s equations and the lorentz equation , in section 3.2 we proposed the so - called alternative ansatz ( [ case_alter ] ) .",
    "this comprised a variant of a similarly named ansatz for the metric perturbations proposed in our previous work @xcite its core idea being the introduction of the scalar potential @xmath1 into the spatial components @xmath6 , too , of the metric perturbations ; it was then showed that a cancellation of terms coming from the @xmath75 and @xmath6 components led to an expression for the lorentz equation that was identical to that of em and contained no additional terms .",
    "in the context of the present work , we extended further our previous ansatz , in a way similar to that adopted in section 3.1 , in order to avoid again the unphysical constraints in the theory .",
    "indeed , employing the ansatz ( [ case_alter ] ) , all potentially harmful terms in the expression of the lorentz force were eliminated , and the set of maxwell s equations was restored with no conditions imposed on the field configurations  the only point of disagreement , a superfluous coefficient of 4 , could be absorbed into the redefinition of the matter / charge density in the context of gem .",
    "pursuing further the analogy between gravity and em , in section 4 we searched for scalar invariant quantities defined in terms of gravitational tensors in the context of the linear approximation employed in gem . in section 4.1 , we defined a novel 3rd - rank tensor @xmath102  an analogue of the electromagnetic field strength tensor @xmath119  and the scalar combination @xmath115 was computed . for both metric ansatzes",
    "( [ case_general ] ) and ( [ case_alter ] ) , it was found that , although this scalar combination resembled the one of @xmath175 in em , the presence of additional terms of the same order as @xmath176 and @xmath177 rendered this combination not satisfactory . in section 4.2",
    ", we proceeded to define two novel 3rd - rank tensors @xmath178 and @xmath179 motivated by the fact that the combination @xmath180 exactly matches the gravitational lagrangian in the linear approximation . here , the results were very encouraging : the aforementioned scalar quantity was indeed proportional to a linear combination of @xmath176 and @xmath177 , as expected , with no additional terms of the same order being present",
    ". enforced by these results , we then demonstrated that a second scalar invariant quantity of the form @xmath181 , where @xmath182 is the dual of @xmath178  an analogue again of the @xmath183 quantity in em  could be defined . for both metric ansatzes ,",
    "this second invariant quantity was found to be indeed proportional to the internal product @xmath184 , with no additional corrections of the same order .    in the last section ,",
    "section 5 , we investigated in detail the conditions under which the gauge invariance of the linearised gravitational theory leads to a gauge invariance of the gem fields @xmath2 and @xmath3 . for a small displacement of the coordinates , parametrised by an arbitrary vector @xmath158 ,",
    "the transformation rule for the metric perturbations @xmath4 was found , and from that the transformation relations for the gem potentials and fields were derived . as has been shown in the literature @xcite , the latter transformation relations reduce to the usual gauge transformations of em under the assumption that the spatial components of @xmath158 vanish . here , using our two novel ansatzes for the metric perturbations ( [ case_general ] ) and ( [ case_alter ] ) , that were shown to lead to more satisfactory results than the traditional ansatz ( [ case1 ] ) regarding the restoration of maxwell s and lorentz equations , we have demonstrated that a gauge invariance of the gem fields @xmath2 and @xmath3 holds for a much more general form of the arbitrary vector @xmath158 .",
    "the conditions that the temporal and spatial components of @xmath158 need to satisfy were derived , and their general configuration was determined . in this way ,",
    "an over - restrictive assumption regarding the form of the arbitrary vector @xmath158 was avoided , and the space of the symmetry present in the theory was enlarged compared to previous studies .    in the previous work of ours @xcite , we had also posed the question whether a tensorial theory based on the formalism of general relativity could exactly re - produce the theory of electromagnetism .",
    "the starting point of that analysis was again the linearised einstein s equations with the constant @xmath185 appearing on the right - hand - side being initially arbitrary instead of taking the usual value of @xmath186 .",
    "had we repeated that analysis by employing our two novel ansatzes for the metric perturbations , a number of satisfactory results would have emerged : ( i ) for the generalised traditional ansatz ( [ case_general ] ) , all maxwell s em equations would have been exactly reproduced under the assumption that @xmath187 ; however , the additional terms in the expression of the lorentz force would now have dire phenomenological consequences , ( ii ) for the alternative ansatz ( [ case_alter ] ) , though , these terms would be altogether absent , with the expression of the lorentz force exactly matching the one in em and the only additional corrections being of order @xmath57 and thus negligible both in the non - relativistic and relativistic limit ; in addition , the set of maxwell s equations would have been again reproduced , now under the assumption that @xmath188 , and for the exact same definitions of the fields @xmath2 and @xmath3 in terms of the potentials @xmath1 and @xmath0 as in true em .",
    "we thus conclude that the use of the alternative ansatz has finally provided the proper form of metric perturbations that , in conjunction with einstein s tensorial equations , has reproduced the complete mathematical framework of the theory of electromagnetism .",
    "naturally , the above suggestion does not aim at replacing the theory of electromagnetism by a tensorial theory ; it rather aims at investigating how far the analogy between gravity and electromagnetism extends , given the persistent difficulty in finding a common mathematical framework to unify gravity and gauge forces .",
    "moreover , as it has been the objective of the theory of gem itself , this analogy may open new directions and lead to the discovery of new phenomena in gravitational physics guided by phenomena already observed in em .",
    "the two novel ansatzes that we have proposed here have come a long way in overcoming previous inconsistencies of gem and in achieving the best analogy between gravity and em in the literature so far .",
    "our results have also improved a previous analysis of ours in the sense that the set of perturbed equations derived in this work are free of any unphysical constraints and valid both far away and close to the sources of the gravitational field ; this , may prove to be of significant importance in future applications of our formalism to phenomena in gravitational physics , especially in the light of the recent discovery of gravitational waves whose study is based on the linear approximation method .",
    "part of this work was supported by the cost action mp1210 `` the string theory universe '' .",
    "here , we present the components of the christoffel symbols for both metric perturbations ansatzes that are necessary for the derivation of the lorentz equation in each case .    employing the expression of the christoffel symbols ( [ christoffel ] ) in the linear approximation and of the initial perturbations @xmath9 from the line - element ( [ line - element - general ] ) for the case of the generalised traditional ansatz , we find the following components ^i_00 & = & _ i - _ i + _ t a^i , + ^i_0j & = & f_ij - ^i_j ( _ t + _ t ) + _ t d^i _ j , [ christ_trad ] + ^i_kj & = & -(^i_j _ k + ^i_k _ j",

    "<S> in this work , we focus on the theory of gravito - electromagnetism ( gem )  the theory that describes the dynamics of the gravitational field in terms of quantities met in electromagnetism  and we propose two novel forms of metric perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> the first one is a generalisation of the traditional gem ansatz , and succeeds in reproducing the whole set of maxwell s equations even for a dynamical vector potential @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the second form , the so - called alternative ansatz , goes beyond that leading to an expression for the lorentz force that matches the one of electromagnetism and is free of additional terms even for a dynamical scalar potential @xmath1 . in the context of the linearised theory , </S>",
    "<S> we then search for scalar invariant quantities in analogy to electromagnetism . </S>",
    "<S> we define three novel , 3rd - rank gravitational tensors , and demonstrate that the last two can be employed to construct scalar quantities that succeed in giving results very similar to those found in electromagnetism . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the gauge invariance of the linearised gravitational theory is studied , and shown to lead to the gauge invariance of the gem fields @xmath2 and @xmath3 for a general configuration of the arbitrary vector involved in the coordinate transformations . </S>"
