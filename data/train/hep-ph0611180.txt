    "similar spectral integrals and sum rules can be constructed for general non - spectral weights @xmath22 , for either @xmath28 or @xmath29 , and for any @xmath30 .",
    "the corresponding spectral integrals are denoted generically by @xmath31 in what follows . for `` inclusive '' sum rules ( those with both @xmath9 and @xmath32 spectral contributions ) the purely @xmath9 contribution",
    "will be referred to as `` longitudinal '' .",
    "@xmath1 and/or @xmath0 are then to be extracted using flavor - breaking differences , @xmath33 , defined by @xmath34 since @xmath33 vanishes in the @xmath35 limit , its ope representation , @xmath36 , begins at dimension @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath3 term is proportional to @xmath37 .",
    "experimental determinations of @xmath33 over a range of @xmath38 and @xmath22 allow a fit for @xmath0 and/or @xmath1 to be performed , so long as @xmath38 is large enough that the ope representation can be reliably employed  @xcite .",
    "the approach is especially well - suited to the determination of @xmath1  @xcite since the smallness of @xmath0 makes the integrated @xmath3 ope contributions at scales @xmath39 , and hence also the corresponding flavor - breaking spectral integral differences , much smaller than the individual flavor @xmath40 and @xmath41 spectral integral terms ( typically at the few to several percent level ) .",
    "explicitly , since eq .",

    "moderate precision for @xmath36 thus suffices for high precision on @xmath45 , provided experimental errors can be brought under control .",
    "we report here on a combined extraction of @xmath0 and @xmath45 employing existing spectral data .",
    "the @xmath40 data , especially the v+a sum , are already quite precise  @xcite",
    ". the @xmath41 data  @xcite , however , suffer from low statistics and have very sizeable errors above the @xmath46 .",
    "ongoing analyses at babar and belle will very significantly reduce the @xmath41 errors in the near future .",
    "the focus here will be on bringing uncertainties on the theoretical ( ope ) side of the analysis under better control , in particular those associated with the slower - than - previously - anticipated convergence of the relevant @xmath3 ope series  @xcite .",
    "the first major problem on the ope side is the very bad behavior of the integrated longtitudinal @xmath3 ope series which shows no sign of converging at any kinematically accessible scale  @xcite , and , even worse , for _ all _ truncation schemes used in the literature , badly violates spectral - positivity - based constraints  @xcite .",
    "inclusive analyses employing the longitudinal ope representation are thus untenable .",
    "fortunately , for a combination of chiral and kinematic reasons , the longitudinal @xmath3 ope problem is easily handled phenomenologically .",
    "apart from the @xmath47 and @xmath48 pole terms , longitudinal spectral contributions vanish in the @xmath35 limit and are doubly - chirally suppressed away from it .",
    "this double chiral suppression is preserved in the ratio of integrated non - pole to pole contributions because the longitudinal kinematic weight in eq .",
    "( [ basictaudecay ] ) has essentially the same value at the @xmath48 pole as in the region of excited strange scalar and pseudoscalar ( ps ) resonances .",
    "the small residual non - pole @xmath41 ps and scalar contributions can , moreover , be well - constrained phenomenologically  @xcite , the former via a sum rule analysis of the @xmath41 ps channel  @xcite , the latter by dispersive single- or coupled - channel @xmath49-scattering - data - based dispersive analyses  @xcite . with the dominant @xmath47 and @xmath48 pole contributions already accurately known , a bin - by - bin subtraction of the longitudinal contributions to the experimental distribution , and hence a determination of the @xmath18 spectral function , can be performed , allowing fesr s not afflicted by the longitudinal @xmath3 ope problem to be constructed .    since the @xmath41 scalar and",
    "ps spectral `` models '' used for the longitudinal subtraction correspond , via scalar and ps sum rules  @xcite , to values of @xmath0 in excellent agreement with recent @xmath50 lattice results  @xcite , significantly larger non - pole contributions are ruled out .",
    "the residual non - pole longitudinal subtractions are thus certainly small , and very well under control at the level required for @xmath18 fesr analyses .",

    "since independent high - scale determinations of @xmath64  @xcite correspond , after 4-loop running and matching  @xcite , to @xmath65 , the convergence of this series , at the spacelike point on the contour @xmath66 , is marginal at best , even at the highest scales accessible in hadronic @xmath2 decay .",
    "although @xmath67 _ does _ decrease as one moves around the contour away from the spacelike point , allowing improvement in the convergence through judicious choices of weight , @xmath22 , one must expect to find very slow convergence of the integrated @xmath3 series for those @xmath22 not chosen specifically with this improvement criterion in mind .",
    "the @xmath4 spectral weights , @xmath68 , with @xmath69 , are highly non - optimal in this regard , since @xmath70 ( with @xmath71 the angular position measured counterclockwise from the timelike point ) is peaked precisely in the spacelike direction .",
    "slow convergence , deteriorating with increasing @xmath72 , is thus expected for the integrated @xmath3 series of the @xmath4 spectral weights .",
    "the results of table i of ref .",
    "@xcite bear out this expectation  @xcite .",
    "several estimates of the integrated @xmath18 @xmath3 ope truncation uncertainty have been considered in the literature : the size of the last term kept , the level of residual scale dependence , the difference between the truncated correlator and adler function evaluations , and various combinations thereof .",
    "the slow convergence of the integrated series can make it difficult to be sufficiently conservative .",
    "e.g. , the quadrature sum of the last term size plus residual scale dependence version of the @xmath61 adler function truncation uncertainty  @xcite , yields a result @xmath73 times smaller than the actual difference between the @xmath61-truncated adler function and @xmath60-truncated correlator results  @xcite .    since , due to the growth of @xmath74 with decreasing scale , higher order terms are relatively more important at lower scales , premature truncation of a slowly converging series will induce an unphysical @xmath38-dependence in extracted , nominally @xmath38-independent quantities . with polynomial weights , @xmath75 ( for which integrated @xmath76 ope contributions not suppressed by additional powers of @xmath74 scale as @xmath77 ) such unphysical @xmath38-dependence can also result if higher @xmath78 contributions which might in principle be present are incorrectly assumed negligible and omitted from the analysis .",
    "the absence of phenomenological input for the values of the relevant @xmath79 condensates makes such omission most dangerous for those @xmath80 having large coefficients @xmath81 , with @xmath82 , where such unknown @xmath79 contributions are potentially enhanced .",
    "the @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 spectral weights , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 provide examples of weights having such large higher order coefficients .    in view of the above discussion",
    ", @xmath38-stability tests are crucial to establishing the reliability of any theoretical error estimate .",
    "failure to find a stability window in @xmath38 or , if not a stability window , then at least a window within which the observed instability is safely smaller than the estimated theoretical uncertainty , is a clear sign of an insufficiently conservative error .",
    "we restrict our attention , in what follows , to the v+a spectral combination , to weights satisfying @xmath89 , and to scales @xmath90 , all of which serve to strongly suppress possible residual ope breakdown effects  @xcite .    the form of the known @xmath91 contributions to @xmath92_{ope}$ ] may be found in ref .",

    "an alternate cipt evaluation , employing the truncated , rg - improved adler function , provides one measure of the truncation uncertainty .",
    "( the two versions are equal to all orders but differ at @xmath94 and higher when both are truncated at @xmath95 . )",
    "exact solutions corresponding to the 4-loop - truncated @xmath96 and @xmath97 functions  @xcite are used for the running of @xmath98 and @xmath99 .    for the spectral integrals we employ the aleph @xmath40",
    "@xcite and @xmath41  @xcite data , for which both data and covariance matrices are publicly available .",
    "a small global renormalization of the @xmath40 data is required to reflect minor changes in the @xmath100 , @xmath101 and total strange branching fractions since the original aleph publication .",
    "global mode - by - mode rescalings of the strange exclusive distributions have also been performed to bring the original aleph branching fractions into agreement with current world average ( pdg06 ) values  @xcite .",
    "errors on the @xmath48 and @xmath47 pole contributions have also been reduced by using the more precise values implied by @xmath102 $ ] and @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "the resulting errors on the @xmath40 and @xmath41 spectral integrals are at the @xmath103 and @xmath104 levels , respectively .",
    "the @xmath41 errors will be drastically reduced by results from babar and belle .",
    "as argued above , very slow convergence is expected for the integrated @xmath3 , @xmath32 @xmath4 spectral weight ope series . such slow convergence is seen explicitly in the results reported in refs .",
    "the situation for @xmath105 is of particular practical interest since the @xmath106 , @xmath107 @xmath41 spectral integral is fixed by the total strangeness branching fraction .",
    "spectral integral errors can thus be reduced through improvements to the various exclusive strange branching fractions .",
    "such improvements are much less experimentally challenging than would be an improved determination of the full @xmath41 spectral distribution , which analyses employing other @xmath38 and/or other weights would require .",
    "the very small normalization of the @xmath107 @xmath3 ope integral , which makes for a rather weak dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath0 , is another favorable feature of this weight  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , these positive features must be weighed against the very poor convergence of the integrated @xmath3 ope series , and the concomitant difficulty in obtaining a reliable estimate of the truncation uncertainty . in the most recent version of this analysis ( see the last of refs .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath1 is obtained using external input for @xmath0 , and @xmath106 only .",

    "@xmath1 , e.g. , changes by @xmath109 even over the rather restricted range @xmath110 .",
    "an alternate estimate of the @xmath3 truncation uncertainty , obtained by taking _",
    "twice _ the quadrature sum of the last term kept and the correlator - minus - adler - function difference yields a result , @xmath111 , much more in keeping with the size of the observed @xmath38 instability .",
    "unfortunately , since a reduction in the truncation uncertainty does not appear likely , this more conservative estimate puts a sub-@xmath112 @xmath1 determination out of reach of the @xmath107 spectral weight analysis .",
    "figure 1 shows the ope and spectral integral differences , as a function of @xmath38 , for various input @xmath113 , with @xmath1 in each case obtained by fitting to the spectral integral difference at @xmath106 .",
    "the very different @xmath38-dependences of the two curves is the source of the @xmath38-instability in the extracted @xmath1 values .",
    "the figure makes clear that the instability in @xmath1 found in ref .",
    "@xcite is not specific to the @xmath0 employed as input in that analysis .",
    "a final illustration of the problematic features of the @xmath4 spectral weight analyses is provided in figure 4 .",
    "given any pair of @xmath4 weights , @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be obtained by a simultaneous fit using the two @xmath106 spectral integrals as input . the figure shows the @xmath114 contours for a series of such fits .",
    "it is evident that no good common fit region for @xmath0 and @xmath1 exists , further strengthening the conclusion that the ope representations for the @xmath4 spectral weights are not under sufficiently good control to allow a reliable determination of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .      to reduce the problems associated with the slow convergence of the @xmath3 , @xmath32 ope series",

    "a good common fit region exists , in sharp contrast to the situation for the @xmath4 spectral weights .",
    "this strongly suggests that the lack of a good common fit region for the @xmath4 spectral weights is a result of the poor convergence behavior of the relevant integrated ope series .",
    "the results of figure 5 correspond to @xmath121 and @xmath122 mev .",
    "a modest reduction of the combined fit region can be achieved by adding a new non - spectral weight , @xmath123 , to the analysis  @xcite .",

    "the result for @xmath0 is in excellent agreement with recent strange scalar and ps sumrule , and @xmath50 lattice , results .    to see how a reduction in the @xmath41 spectral errors might impact the errors on @xmath1 and @xmath0",
    ", we consider a scenario in which the @xmath41 spectral function central values remain unchanged but the errors ( covariances ) are reduced by a factor of @xmath129 ( @xmath130 ) .",
    "the combined fit errors on @xmath1 and @xmath0 are reduced to @xmath131 and @xmath132 mev , respectively .",
    "this , of course , provides only a rough guide , since non - trivial shifts in the central @xmath41 spectral function values are certainly to be expected .",
    "nonetheless , the exercise makes clear that very significant reductions in the @xmath1 error should be anticipated once b factory data becomes available .",

    "<S> we discuss the simultaneous determination of @xmath0 and @xmath1 from flavor - breaking hadronic @xmath2 decay sum rules , focussing on weight choices designed to better control problems associated with the slow convergence of the relevant integrated @xmath3 ope series . </S>",
    "<S> the results are found to display improved stability and consistency relative to those of conventional analyses based on the `` @xmath4 spectral weights '' . </S>",
    "<S> the results for @xmath0 agree well with those of recent strange scalar sum rule and strange pseudoscalar sum rule and lattice analyses . </S>",
    "<S> results for @xmath1 agree within errors with those of lattice - input - based @xmath5 /\\gamma [ \\pi_{\\mu 2}]$ ] and @xmath6 analyses . </S>",
    "<S> very significant error reductions are shown to be expected , especially for @xmath1 , once improved strange spectral data from the b factory experiments becomes available . </S>"
