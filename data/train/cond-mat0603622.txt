    "non - hermitean random matrices have interesting and important applications in various physical problems .",
    "examples for such applications are the phase diagram of qcd@xcite , nuclear decay and resonances in multichannel scattering in chaotic and disordered systems @xcite , neural networks @xcite , and asymmetric random hopping matrices - the hatano - nelson model @xcite - with applications to pinning of magnetic flux lines in high temperature superconductors and also as a new tool for studying anderson localization in disordered conductors .",
    "studying anderson localization by means of non - hermitean matrices is also one of the reasons for the very recent growing interest in studying the statistics of resonance widths and delay times in random media @xcite .",
    "our final example is diffusion in random velocity fields @xcite , which gives rise to random fokker - planck operators .",
    "for a nice recent overview of random matrix theory and its applications , including non - hermitean matrices , see @xcite .",
    "let us recall first a few basic facts about hermitean random matrices .",
    "a basic tool in studying hermitean random matrices @xmath0 ( henceforth all matrices will be taken to be @xmath1 with @xmath2 tending to infinity unless otherwise specified ) is the green s function defined by g(z)= [ gz ] where @xmath3 denotes averaging over the random distribution from which the matrices @xmath0 are drawn .",
    "diagonalizing @xmath0 by a unitary transformation we have g(z)= _ k=1^n 1z-_kwhere the @xmath2 real numbers @xmath4 are the eigenvalues of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , @xmath5 is a meromorphic function with poles at the eigenvalues of @xmath0 . in the large @xmath2 limit ,",
    "the poles merge into a cut ( or several cuts ) on the real axis in the large @xmath2 limit ( assuming that all eigenvalues are typically confined in a finite segment , independent of @xmath2 ) . the averaging process smudges the eigenvalues into cuts already at finite @xmath2 . ] .",
    "powerful theorems from the theory of complex - analytic functions can then be brought to bear to the problem of determining @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "all of this is well - known .",
    "in contrast , for a non - hermitean matrix , the eigenvalues invade the complex plane .",
    "for example , for non - hermitean matrices @xmath0 generated with the probability @xmath6 , ginibre determined long ago @xcite that in the large-@xmath2 limit , the eigenvalues are uniformly distributed over a disk of radius unity in the complex plane .",
    "the green s function corresponding to this ensemble is g(z , z^*)= = \\ {    cc z^ *   & |z| < 1 + & + 1z   & |z|>1    . , [ ginibre ] and it is obviously not analytic inside the unit disk",
    ". in general , the eigenvalues of a non - hermitean matrix taken from some probability ensemble , will occupy , on average , a two - dimensional domain @xmath7 of the complex plane , where the green s function is non - analytic .",
    "thus , we lose the powerful aid of analytic function theory in analyzing these ensembles .    in the theory of hermitean random matrices , a powerful method consists of the feynman diagrammatic expansion @xcite in which one expands @xmath8 as a series in @xmath9 , the",
    " bare quark propagator . \"",
    "this method is clearly no longer available in studying non - hermitean random matrices .",
    "the knowledge of @xmath5 as a series in @xmath9 can no longer tell us anything about the behavior @xmath5 for small @xmath10 , as the simple example ( [ ginibre ] ) above makes clear .",
    "the eigenvalues fill a two - dimensional region rather than a one - dimensional region , as is the case for hermitean matrices .",
    "a renormalization group inspired method used in @xcite implicitly involves an expansion in @xmath9 and is thus also not available for dealing with non - hermitean matrices without suitable further developments .",
    "i shall now derive a couple of standard formulas which play a central role in studying the eigenvalue distribution of random non - hermitean matrices .",
    "the derivation is straightforward ( see , e.g. , @xcite and section 2 in @xcite , and references therein ) , and is based on the identities we define @xmath11 so that @xmath12 . clearly , @xmath13 .",
    "similarly , we define @xmath14 so that @xmath15 . ]",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17    we are now ready to deal with the average density of eigenvalues of a non - hermitean matrix @xmath0 .",
    "we diagonalize the matrix by a similarity transformation [ similarity ] = s^-1 s where @xmath18 denotes a diagonal matrix with elements @xmath19 , @xmath20 . taking the hermitean conjugate we have @xmath21 . by definition ,",
    "the density of eigenvalues is [ rho1 ] ( x , y)= _ i ( x-_i )   ( y- _ i ) . from the identities mentioned above , we obtain that @xmath22 .",
    "thus , using the identity @xmath23 we may express @xmath24 in terms of @xmath0 , and in a manner which is manifestly symmetric in @xmath10 and @xmath25 , as [ rho ] ( x , y ) = 1 ^ *   ( z- ) ( z^*-^ ) .",
    "this expression involves the logarithm inside the average , as well as two derivatives . thus ,",
    "unless one has a simple way of calculating the average in ( [ rho ] ) ( _ e.g. , _ the replica method in the case of gaussian ensembles @xcite ) , ( [ rho ] ) is not a practical expression for @xmath26 . in many cases it is easier to calculate the green s function [ greens ] g(z",
    ", z^*)= = _",
    "i 1(x - x_i ) + i(y - y_i ) , ( with @xmath27 ) than to do the average @xmath28 then , from ( [ rho1 ] ) and from one of the identities mentioned above , we have [ rho11 ] ( x , y ) = 1 ^ *  g(z , z^ * ) , which is a simpler representation of @xmath26 than ( [ rho ] ) .",
    "these two representations for @xmath26 and the relation between them can be interpreted by recognizing ( [ rho ] ) as a two dimensional poisson equation for the electrostatic potential @xmath29 created by the charge density @xmath26 .",
    "this connection between eigenvalue distributions of complex matrices and two - dimensional electrostatics has been long known in the literature @xcite .",
    "continuing along this line , consider the green s function @xmath30 in ( [ greens ] ) .",
    "if we define the electric field @xmath31 then from the definition of @xmath30 we have [ electric ] * e * ( * x * ) = d^2 y   ( * y * ) * x*-*y * |*x*-*y*|^2 and thus ( [ rho11 ] ) is simply the statement of gauss law for this electrostatic problem .",
    "i end this section with a speculative remark , made for the first time in @xcite .",
    "as was pointed out earlier , in the theory of random hermitean matrices it is well known that it is much easier to work with @xmath32 rather than with the density of eigenvalues @xmath33 directly , since the power of analytic function can be brought to bear on @xmath5 . of course",
    ", one can go from @xmath34 to @xmath5 with the identity [ plemelj ] 1  = 1x^2+^2(x ) .    here , for random non - hermitean matrices",
    "our formula ( [ rho ] ) gives the density of eigenvalues @xmath26 directly , but this formula is awkward to work with because of the logarithm . its direct analog in the theory of random hermitean matrices would be @xmath35 , which would also be extremely awkward to work with .",
    "it would thus be desirable to define a quantity analogous to @xmath5 and develop a method for calculating it .",
    "reasoning along these lines we are led to an attempt to write a function of a quaternionic variable , in the same way that going from @xmath34 to @xmath5 we went from a function of a real variable to a function of a complex variable .",
    "indeed , the obvious analog of ( [ plemelj ] ) is easy to find , namely , [ quatplemelj ] & & 12 j   +   + & & = |z - j|^3= ( x^2+y^2+^2)^3/22(x )  ( y ) . here",
    "@xmath36 is a complex number , @xmath37 is a small positive real number and @xmath38 is the standard basis of the quaternion algebra replaced everywhere by the third quaternion basis element @xmath39 .",
    "also , @xmath37 may be taken complex . ] .",
    "( the absolute value of a quaternion is defined by @xmath40 . )    unfortunately , ( [ quatplemelj ] ) as it stands , is less useful than ( [ rho ] ) , because it leads to the quaternionic green s function @xmath41 ( @xmath42 being a quaternionic variable ) [ quatg ] g(q ) = _ i 1(q-_i ) | q-_i",
    "|which involves the absolute value operation explicitly , and thus can not be written as a simple trace like ( [ gz ] ) .",
    "note , however , that if we split @xmath42 quite generally into @xmath43 ( @xmath44 being ordinary complex variables ) , then @xmath45 is manifestly non - analytic in @xmath10 as @xmath46 , even before taking the average .",
    "this was posed in @xcite as an interesting problem , namely to find a useful quaternionic generalization of ( [ gz ] ) for random non - hermitean matrices , and to develop the analogue of the work of brzin et al .",
    "@xcite associated with it . unfortunately",
    ", this problem is still open , at the moment of transcribing this talk .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 i present the method of hermitization @xcite by which the problem of determining the eigenvalue density of random non - hermitean matrices can be reduced to the more familiar problem of determining the eigenvalue density of random hermitean matrices . in section 3",
    "i explain how this method was applied in @xcite to derive a master formula for the density of eigenvalues of non - hermitean random matrices taken from a large class of rotationally invariant non - gaussian probability ensembles .",
    "this section contains a detailed pedagogical exposition of the diagrammatic method and its large-@xmath2 behavior , which is the basis for the discussion in that section . in section 4",
    "i present numerical simulations of the quartic ensemble , carried in @xcite , and demonstrate that they fit well with the theoretical predictions of the formalism developed in section 3 . in section 5 i formulate and prove the `` single ring '' theorem of @xcite , according to which , in the large-@xmath2 limit , the shape of the eigenvalue distribution associated with any of the ensembles studied in section 3 is either a disk or an annulus . finally , in sections 6 and 7 , following @xcite , i present universal properties of the disk and annular phases and of the transition between them , as well as nice explicit expressions for the location of the boundaries of the eigenvalue distribution and its boundary values .",
    "unfortunately , for lack of space , i can not cover the interesting topic of adding random non - hermitean matrices .",
    "the interested reader could read about it in @xcite .",
    "i have emphasized that a straightforward diagrammatic method is not allowed for non - hermitean matrices .",
    "somewhat remarkably , it is possible to arrive at a diagrammatic method indirectly .",
    "i will show that the problem of determining the eigenvalue density of random non - hermitean matrices can be reduced to the problem of determining the eigenvalue density of random hermitean matrices , for which the diagrammatic method may be applied .",
    "this is achieved by the _ method of hermitization _ , as it was dubbed in @xcite .",
    "variants of this idea were presented independently in @xcite .",
    "( here we follow the conventions of @xcite . )",
    "we start with the representation @xmath47 ( namely , eq . ( [ rho ] ) . ) by standard manipulations we observe that @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the hermitean @xmath50 matrix hamiltonian [ h ] h= (    cc 0   & -z + & + ^-z^ * & 0    ) .",
    "thus , if we can determine [ object ] f ( ; z , z^ * ) = 12n 2n(- h)we can determine @xmath26 .",
    "the matrix @xmath49 is what is called a chiral matrix .",
    "has been discussed by numerous authors @xcite .",
    "( see also the paper by feinberg and zee cited in @xcite . ) ] due to its block structure , it anticommutes with the `` @xmath51 '' matrix @xmath52 , with the immediate consequence that its spectrum consists of pairs of eigenvalues with equal magnitudes and opposite signs .",
    "namely , if @xmath53 is an eigenvalue of @xmath49 , so is @xmath54 .",
    "consider now the propagator matrix associated with @xmath49 , namely , _",
    "(; z , z^ * ) = ( 1-h ) _ [ propagator ] where @xmath55 is a complex variable and the indices @xmath56 and @xmath57 run over all possible @xmath58 values .",
    "here we followed a common practice and borrowed some terminology from quantum chromodynamics : we may consider @xmath59 as  gluons \" ( in zero space - time dimensions ) , which interact with a @xmath58 dimensional multiplet of  quarks \" @xmath60 , with a complex mass matrix ( the bare  inverse propagator \" ) [ inverseprop ] _ 0 ^ -1 =(    cc   & z + & + z^ * &    ) ( expressed in terms of its @xmath1 blocks ) .",
    "@xmath61 is thus the propagator of these quarks in the fluctuating gluon field .",
    "the crucial point is that since @xmath49 is hermitean , @xmath62 can be determined by the usual methods of hermitean random matrix theory .",
    "in particular , as we already mentioned , the diagrammatic evaluation of ( [ propagator ] ) is essentially the expansion of @xmath61 in powers of @xmath63 , with interaction vertices @xmath49 .",
    "this is a well defined procedure for large @xmath55 , and it converges to a unique function which is analytic in the complex @xmath55 plane , except for the cut ( or cuts ) along the real axis which contain the eigenvalues of @xmath49 . after summing this series ( and thus determining @xmath64 in closed form ) ,",
    "we are allowed to set @xmath65 in ( [ propagator ] ) .",
    "speaking colloquially , we may say that the crucial maneuver here is that while we can not expand in powers of @xmath10 , we can arrange for @xmath10 to  hitch a ride \" with @xmath55 and at the end of the ride , throw @xmath55 away .",
    "we can now calculate @xmath26 by two different methods , each with its advantages .",
    "the first is to observe that -1h =(    cc 0   & 1z^ * - ^ + & + 1z- & 0    ) .",
    "thus , the quantity @xmath66 is simply the lower left block of @xmath67 . in other words",
    ", once we have @xmath64 we can set @xmath55 to zero and use ( [ greens ] ) and ( [ rho11 ] ) to write [ hermitrho ] ( x , y ) = 1n ^ * 2n .",
    "an alternative is to take the trace of @xmath61 : [ gh ] (; z , z^ * ) = 12n 2n  1- h=",
    "n  1 ^ 2 - ( z^*-^)(z- ) , from which one can determine ( [ object ] ) ( in terms of a dispersion integral ) , and therefore determine @xmath26 , as explained in @xcite in detail .",
    "i shall not pursue this possibility here .",
    "however , a few important comments relating to ( [ gh ] ) are in order . observe from ( [ gh ] ) that [ observe ] ( 0-i0 ; z , z^ * ) = in ( ) and thus counts the ( average ) number of zero - eigenvalues of the positive semi - definite hermitean matrix @xmath68 .",
    "thus , if ( on the average ) @xmath0 has no eigenvalues equal to @xmath10 , or in other words , if the density of eigenvalues of @xmath0 vanishes at @xmath10 , then [ boundary ] ( 0-i0 ; z , z^*)= 0 , independently of the large @xmath2 limit . in particular , the boundaries of the eigenvalue distribution of @xmath0 in the large @xmath2 limit , are the curve ( or curves ) in the complex plane which separate regions where @xmath69 from regions where @xmath70 . as a matter of fact",
    ", one can infer the location of these boundaries even without an explicit knowledge of @xmath71 and @xmath72 , by investigating the  gap equation \" for @xmath71 , namely , the trace of both sides of ( [ propagator ] ) , and then setting @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "the  gap equation \" is a polynomial in @xmath74 with real coefficients ( which depend on @xmath10 explicitly as well as through @xmath72 , and the parameters which appear in the probability distribution for @xmath0 . ) due to the chiral nature of @xmath49 , this polynomial contains a trivial factor of @xmath71 which we immediately factor out .",
    "setting @xmath75 in the remaining factor we obtain an equation for the boundary .",
    "this is discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the formalism developed here has nothing to do with large @xmath2 as such .",
    "it is also totally independent of the form of the probability distribution @xmath76 .",
    "the formalism is of course indifferent to the method one may choose to use to determine @xmath77 .    to summarize , we have obtained a formalism - the  method of hermitization \" - for reducing the problem of dealing with random non - hermitean matrices to the well - studied problem of dealing with random hermitean matrices .",
    "given the non - hermitean matrix @xmath0 , we study the hermitean matrix @xmath49 instead . by whatever method one",
    "prefers , once one has determined the quark propagator @xmath61 ( or its trace , the green s function @xmath78 ) , one can in principle obtain @xmath26 using ( [ hermitrho ] ) ( or using the other method mentioned following ( [ gh ] ) ) . whether that can be done in practice",
    "is of course another story . in the next section",
    "i shall present a large family of probability distributions @xmath76 for which it is possible to compute @xmath79 in closed form ( in the large-@xmath2 limit ) by a diagrammatic method .",
    "therefore , for those models , the algorithm discussed above can in fact be followed all the way to the end .",
    "the literature on random non - hermitean prior to @xcite has focused exclusively on gaussian randomness , a prime example being ginibre s work @xcite on the probability distribution @xmath80 . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that using the method of hermitization one can determine the density of eigenvalues of probability distribution of the form [ prob ] p ( ) = 1z e^-nv(^ ) , where @xmath81 is an arbitrary polynomial of its argument .",
    "indeed , by a simple trick , it was shown in @xcite that one can obtain the desired density of eigenvalues with a minimal amount of work , by judiciously exploiting the existing literature on random hermitean matrices . in this section",
    "i explain how this can be done .    in a certain sense",
    ", the work presented in @xcite may be thought of as the analog of the work of brzin et al . for random hermitean",
    "matrices @xcite ; they showed how the density of eigenvalues of hermitean matrices @xmath0 taken from the probability distribution @xmath82 $ ] with @xmath81 an arbitrary polynomial can be determined , and not just for the gaussian case studied by wigner and others , in which @xmath83 .",
    "an important simplifying feature of the analysis in @xcite is that @xmath84 depends only on the eigenvalues of @xmath0 , and not on the unitary matrix that diagonalizes it .",
    "in contrast , the probability distribution ( [ prob ] ) for non - hermitean matrices depends explicitly on the @xmath85 matrix @xmath86 used to diagonalize @xmath87 , and @xmath86 does not decouple .",
    "remarkably however , for the gaussian @xmath84 , ginibre @xcite managed to integrate over @xmath86 explicitly and derived an explicit expression for the probability distribution of the eigenvalues of @xmath0 .",
    "unfortunately , it is not clear how to integrate over @xmath86 and derive the expression for the eigenvalue probability distribution for non - gaussian distributions of the form ( [ prob ] ) . in @xcite",
    "this serious difficulty was circumvented by using the method of hermitization .    due to the symmetry of @xmath84 under the transformation @xmath88 , the density of eigenvalues is obviously rotational invariant .",
    "it is useful to introduce to circularly invariant density as [ radrho ] ( x , y)(r)/2 .",
    "rotational invariance thus leads to a simpler form of the defining formula ( [ greens ] ) for @xmath72 , reproduced here as @xmath89 which reads [ circular ] ( r ) zg(z , z^*)=_0^r rd r  ( r ) , whence [ rhocirc ] ( r ) = 1r ddr .",
    "clearly , the quantity @xmath90 is a positive monotonically increasing function , which satisfies the obvious  sum - rules \" [ sumrules ] ( 0)=0 ( ) = 1 . in particular , observe that the first condition in ( [ sumrules ] ) insures that no @xmath91 spike arises in @xmath26 when calculating it from ( [ rho11 ] ) with @xmath72 given by ( [ circular ] ) , as it should be .",
    "we are now ready to perform the diagrammatic expansion for probability distributions of the form ( [ prob ] ) .",
    "consider the matrix green s function @xmath61 in ( [ propagator ] ) and write it as [ propagator1 ] = ( 1_0 ^ -1 - v ) _",
    ", where @xmath92 is the inverse propagator defined in ( [ inverseprop ] ) and @xmath81 is the random chiral matrix ( the `` gluon field '' ) [ random ] v= (    cc 0   & + & + ^ & 0    ) . for large complex @xmath55 we may perfom the perturbative expansion of @xmath61 in powers s survive in ( [ perturbative ] ) for probability distributions of the form ( [ prob ] ) . ] of @xmath93 [ perturbative ]",

    "this was our motivation to `` hermitize '' the problem to begin with .",
    "the diagrammatic method @xcite provides a convenient and efficient way of representing the various terms which appear in the perturbation series ( [ perturbative ] ) . before sketching the feynman rules for this expansion , some important symmetry considerations are in order .    as was mentioned following ( [ propagator ] ) , @xmath61 is essentially the propagator for the quarks @xmath94 in the fluctuating gluon field @xmath81 .",
    "let us split the @xmath58 dimensional quark multiplet @xmath60 into two @xmath2 dimensional  flavors \" , @xmath95 .",
    "we see then that the  quark - quark - gluon \" interaction is [ qqg ] ^v = u^d + d^^u .",
    "this interaction term , and the probability distribution ( [ prob ] ) are manifestly invariant under the gauge transformation @xmath96 and @xmath97 , where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are two independent unitary matrices , i.e. , under the @xmath100 subgroup of @xmath101 .",
    "these transformations may be written more compactly as [ gauge ] v v u^ , , =(    cc p & 0 + 0 & q    ) .",
    "we shall index quantities which transform under the first @xmath102 in ( [ gauge ] ) by latin indices @xmath103 , and quantities which transform under the second @xmath102 by indices from the beginning of the greek alphabet @xmath104.(indices from the middle of the greek alphabet , @xmath105 are reserved for @xmath58 dimensional objects . ) thus , for example , we have @xmath106,and the mixed object @xmath107 .",
    "let us turn now to the feynman rules for our diagrammatic expansion .",
    "their presentation will be only sketchy and qualitative , since all that will really matter to us in the discussion below is counting powers of @xmath109 .",
    "in fact , we are about to sum an infinite set of leading diagrams without ever computing any specific feynman diagram .",
    "we start with the propagators .",
    "the bare quark propagators @xmath110 and @xmath111 are simply the four @xmath1 blocks of @xmath112 .",
    "they are all of order @xmath108 .",
    "( note that the object traced over in ( [ hermitrho ] ) and ( [ gh ] ) is essentially @xmath113 .",
    "this trivial observation gives at least a practical justification for the factor @xmath108 in the bare quark propagator .",
    "a deeper reason for this normalization of the quark propagator will be provided below . )",
    "these propagators are indicated in fig.1 ( b)-(e ) .",
    "the diagonal blocks of @xmath112 correspond to quark propagation without flavor changing .",
    "the @xmath114 propagator is indicated in fig.1(b ) by a full line , and the @xmath115 propagator is indicated in fig.1(c ) by a dashed line .",
    "the off - diagonal blocks correspond to quark propagation with flavor changing .",
    "the lines are all directed since the quarks are `` charged '' complex fields .",
    "since all the blocks of @xmath116 are proportional to the @xmath1 unit matrix , color is preserved under quark propagation , whether flavor is changed or not .",
    "consider now the `` pure glue '' action [ potential ] nv(^ ) = nm^2 ^+ ng_4 ( ^)^2 + ng_6 ( ^)^3 + in the exponent of ( [ prob ] ) . by definition , it is proportional to @xmath2 , and the `` gluon self - couplings '' @xmath117 are all of order @xmath118 .",
    "thus , a typical matrix element in @xmath0 , drawn from the ensemble defined by ( [ prob ] ) , is of order @xmath119 ( and arbitrary phase ) , which leads , by standard arguments , to the conclusion that typical eigenvalues of @xmath0 are of order @xmath118 , as was already mentioned in the context of ginibre s ensemble .",
    "the bare gluon propagator can be read - off the quadratic term in ( [ potential ] ) in the usual manner .",
    "we find [ gluonprop ] _",
    "i ^*_j_0 = 1n m^2 _ ij_. it is of order @xmath108 , as a direct consequence of the explicit @xmath2 dependence in ( [ prob ] ) . in order that the quark propagator have the same @xmath2-dependence as the gluon s",
    ", we scaled the quark propagator to be of order @xmath108 as well .",
    "this behavior , together with the fact that the `` gluon self - couplings '' @xmath117 are all of order @xmath118 , will ensure that the model has a smooth behavior as @xmath120 , as will be seen in more detail below .",
    "the bare gluon propagator is depicted in fig.1(a ) . following t hooft @xcite ,",
    "it is represented by a double line , simply because @xmath0 carries two indices .",
    "the flows along these lines preserve both color and flavor , as is evident from ( [ gluonprop ] ) .",
    "the reason why the lines in fig.1(a ) run in opposite directions is easy to understand .",
    "observe that @xmath0 transforms under gauge transformations as @xmath121 .",
    "thus , the bare propagation of @xmath0 is similar to a process in one end of which a @xmath122-quark is destroyed and a @xmath123-quark is created , and in the other end of which the opposite occurs .",
    "let us discuss now the vertices .",
    "from the `` quark - quark - gluon '' interaction ( [ qqg ] ) we see that a gluon @xmath0 always absorbs a @xmath123-quark and emits a @xmath122-quark , and @xmath124 does the opposite .",
    "these two processes are described by the two quark - gluon vertices depicted in fig.2(a),(b ) .",
    "both vertices are taken to be proportional to @xmath2 , so that they be of the same order of magnitude as the gluon self - interaction vertices , such as the quartic vertex with coupling @xmath125 shown in fig.2(c ) and the sextic vertex with coupling @xmath126 in fig.2(d ) .",
    "another way of seeing that the quark - gluon vertices should be of order @xmath2 is to note from ( [ propagator1 ] ) that with the @xmath108 normalization of the quark propagator we have @xmath127 .    that all vertices scale in the same way with @xmath2 , as do the propagators , is needed to obtain a smooth large-@xmath2 behavior .",
    "note from figs.2(a)-(d ) that both color and flavor flow unobstructed through the various vertices .",
    "this is , of course , because all interaction terms are gauge invariant .    to summarize , all bare vertices are of order @xmath2 , and all propagators are of order @xmath108 .",
    "now , use the vertices and propagators defined above as building blocks of graphs - feynman diagrams .",
    "the diagrams thus constructed are called double - line diagrams .    in order to compute a certain observable , all double - line diagrams consistent with that observable",
    "should be drawn , computed and added with the appropriate combinatoric factors .",
    "note that when a closed index loop occurs in a diagram , its index should be summed over .",
    "therefore , we should assign a factor @xmath2 to each index loop .",
    "we would like now to study the @xmath108 behavior of these double - line diagrams , and show that it is determined by their topological properties @xcite .",
    "( an excellent discussion of this issue is given in @xcite , which i shall now follow with the appropriate modifications . )",
    "let us start , for simplicity , with connected `` vacuum to vacuum '' diagrams , i.e. , connected double - line diagrams without external legs .",
    "( such diagrams arise , for example , in the perturbative computation of the normalization factor @xmath128 in ( [ prob ] ) .",
    "their sum is essentially @xmath129 .",
    "the expansion ( [ perturbative ] ) of the quark propagator is of course not the sum of vacuum diagrams . )",
    "since there are no external legs , each index line in the diagram has to be a closed _ oriented _ loop . obviously , there are two types of such loops - loops made of a full line and loops made of a dashed line .",
    "let us attach a little surface - a polygon - to each of these index loops . since there are two kinds of loops - there are two kinds of such polygons .",
    "thus , we can think of the double - line diagram in question as a tiled , triangulated ( or more precisely - polygonated ) big two - dimensional surface , where any pair of edges of two different polygons , which share a gluonic double - line propagator , are identified . since these two edges always run in opposite directions ( recall fig.1(a ) )",
    ", the orientations of all polygons are the same , and the surface thus constructed is _",
    "orientable_. moreover , since the two lines which make a gluon propagator are of different types , and since index lines flow unobstructed through the vertices , any two neighboring polygons which share a gluonic edge must be of different types .",
    "in other words , our surface has a checkerboard structure .",
    "this surface may have edges , formed by quark lines . also , it will generally be multiply connected - i.e. , contain `` handles '' and internal holes .",
    "an example of such a ( simply connected ) surface appears in fig.3 .",
    "counting the power of @xmath2 associated with such surface is easy .",
    "assume the surface in question has @xmath81 vertices , @xmath130 edges and @xmath131 faces .",
    "each vertex is an interaction vertex in the feynman diagram , and thus contributes a factor @xmath2 .",
    "each edge is a propagator which carries a factor @xmath108 , and each face is an index - loop carrying a factor @xmath2 .",
    "all - in - all , the graph is proportional to @xmath132 , where [ euler ] = f - e+v is the euler character of the graph - a topological invariant of the graph .    as is well - known , every connected oriented two - dimensional surface is topologically equivalent to a sphere with an appropriate number of punctures ( holes ) and handles ( or `` wormholes '' ) attached to it .",
    "for example , a torus is equivalent to a sphere with one handle attached , a disk - to a sphere with one puncture , a cylinder - to a doubly punctured sphere , etc .",
    "let us denote the number of handles ( the so - called _ genus _ of the graph ) by @xmath133 , and the number of punctures ( holes or boundaries ) by @xmath134 . then a well - known theorem states that [ genus ] = 2 - 2 g - b. thus , the leading vacuum diagrams in the limit @xmath120 must have @xmath135 , i.e. , the topology of a sphere .",
    "they are thus proportional to @xmath136 .",
    "obviously , they can not contain quark loops , which are unpaired index loops and thus correspond to holes in the surface ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "the last observation is more or less straightforward - one needs just one vertex factor to create either a pair of quarks or a triplet of gluons , but there are essentially @xmath2 times more gluon types to sum over than quarks .    by removing a randomly chosen face off our leading order graph ,",
    "we can continuously stretch it open and project it onto the plane . for this reason",
    ", these leading vacuum graphs with spherical topology are also known as _ planar _ graphs .",
    "( we can also patch this planar graph back into a sphere , by including the point at infinity . )",
    "vacuum diagrams which depend of properties of quarks ( i.e. , on @xmath138 in our case ) must contain at least one quark loop .",
    "it follows from ( [ genus ] ) that the leading such graphs in the large-@xmath2 limit must contain precisely one quark loop ( i.e. - a single hole ) and no handles .",
    "such graphs have the topology of a disk , and could thus be drawn on the plane .",
    "they are planar graphs , like the pure glue graphs , with the sole difference between the two cases being that the outer boundary of that graph is that of the hole - i.e. , the quark loop .",
    "there can be no quark loops in the _ interior _ of the graph in the large-@xmath2 limit .",
    "the reader may identify the feynman rules described above as those which correspond to the zero - dimensional `` quantum field theory '' with lagrangian [ lagrangian ] l = nv(^ ) + ^(ng_0 ^ -1 - nv ) .",
    "diagrams which contribute in higher orders of the @xmath108 expansion of this theory do contain quark loops in their interiors , i.e. , correspond to surfaces with internal holes .",
    "diagrams with such internal quark loops obviously _ do not _ appear in the expansion of @xmath139 since the random matrix probability distribution ( [ prob ] ) really does not contain any dynamical quarks .",
    "one method of suppressing these internal quark loops to any order in the @xmath108 expansion of ( [ lagrangian ] ) is to apply the so - called `` replica trick '' ) into @xmath140 copies , with the same inverse bare propagator and coupling to the gluons .",
    "one then computes various observables in the replicated theory as a function of @xmath140 , considered as a complex variable , and then take the limit @xmath141 .",
    "each internal quark loop costs a factor @xmath140 and is therefore suppressed in that limit . ]",
    "since here we are interested only in the @xmath120 limit , namely , the leading order in the @xmath108 expansion , there is no need to invoke any replica considerations .",
    "obviously , by cutting open the quark loop at the boundary of our vacuum diagram at one point , and attaching color indices @xmath56 and @xmath57 at the two ends , we obtain a diagram which contributes to @xmath113 in the expansion ( [ perturbative ] ) .",
    "thus , to leading order in @xmath108 , all diagrams which contribute to @xmath113 ( and are therefore of order @xmath108 ) are planar diagrams , with the quark line running at the boundary , and all gluon double - lines are attached to it on the _ same side _ , without crossing each other .",
    "a couple of such diagrams appear in fig.4 .",
    "i shall now explain how to sum all these planar diagrams systematically and thus obtain @xmath113 in the limit @xmath120 .",
    "the quark propagator ( [ propagator ] ) is given by the dyson - schwinger equation in terms of the one - quark irreducible self - energy @xmath142 : [ selfenergy ] 1n= ( 1n**_0 ^ -1",

    "we emphasize that this equation always holds , and practically amounts to the definition of the one - quark irreducible self energy .",

    "amputating two external legs amounts to multiplication of the latter by @xmath136 .",
    "another way of looking at this is to say that the self - energy should scale with @xmath2 as does the quark - quark - gluon vertex @xmath143 which is combined with the inverse propagator in the averaged quantity in ( [ propagator ] ) . ] .",
    "thus , to leading order , @xmath144 is of order @xmath118 .",
    "a couple of planar one - quark irreducible diagrams which contribute to @xmath142 appear in fig.5 .    for pedagogical clarity",
    ", we also display in fig.6 a couple of non - planar self - energy diagrams which contribute in the next - to - leading order .",
    "the planar self - energy diagrams shown on fig.5 are clearly proportional to the unit matrix . by carefully studying a few additional planar self - energy diagrams",
    "the reader can convince himself or herself that this is a general property : in these planar self - energy diagrams , there is always a unique peripheral index line , which emanates from the quark - quark - gluon vertex at one end of the diagram , and participates in several gluon propagators and flows unobstructed through a number of gluon self - interaction vertices , without crossing any other index line , all the way to the quark - quark - gluon vertex at the other end of the diagram .",
    "( a slightly different way of looking at this is to connect the two ends of the diagram by a quark propagator and close it into a planar vacuum diagram . the point of gluing lies on a quark line , which is of course the",
    "_ outer _ edge of one of the polygons making the surface .",
    "the other edges of that polygon lie within the surface and combine to a directed index line , which becomes the peripheral index line mentioned above upon cutting the diagram open . ) thus , evidently , the off - diagonal blocks of @xmath142 are null and its @xmath114 and @xmath115 blocks must be proportional to the unit matrix . furthermore , the @xmath122 and @xmath123 quarks are completely equivalent .",
    "( we can switch the roles of @xmath0 and @xmath124 in ( [ prob ] ) and nothing would change . ) thus , the @xmath114 and @xmath115 blocks of @xmath144 must be equal .",
    "in other words , for probability distributions of the form ( [ prob ] ) [ sigmamn ] _ = (; r ) _ ( where we recall that @xmath145 . ) note that @xmath146 depends on @xmath147 and not separately on @xmath10 and @xmath25 because it may be expanded as an infinite sum of traces of @xmath148 , each term of which is a function only of @xmath55 and @xmath147 .",
    "thus , from ( [ selfenergy ] ) , [ gmn ] = 1r^2 - ( -)^2   (    cc -   & z + & + z^ * & -    ) , leading to [ selfenergy1 ] _ _ = - r^2 - ( -)^2 .",
    "the important point @xcite is that in the large-@xmath2 limit , the one - quark irreducible self - energy @xmath149 can be written in terms of the cumulants @xmath150 of @xmath151 ( eq . ( [ prob ] ) ) , namely , the connected correlators involving @xmath39 @xmath0 s and @xmath124 s .",
    "thus , to leading order in @xmath108 , this cumulant is the sum of all connected planar pure glue diagrams with @xmath39 external @xmath0 s and @xmath124 s ( with a prescribed index structure ) . by definition",
    ", @xmath150 is a quantity of order @xmath2 .",
    "( it could be thought of essentially as the `` dressed '' gluon self - interaction vertices @xmath152 . )",

    "a moment s reflections reveals that this operation removes @xmath153 index loops ( i.e. , @xmath39 internal index loops as well as the outer perimeter loop ) and also @xmath39 gluon propagators .",

    "it is connected to the internal index line which emanates from the quark - quark - gluon vertex on the left and flows through the gluon dark blob . on the way , that line participates in several gluon propagators and flows",
    "unobstructed through a number of gluon self - interaction vertices in any of the planar pure glue diagrams which make the blob , without crossing any other index line , all the way to the quark - quark - gluon vertex on the right .",
    "thus , it preserves its color index , which must be summed over .",
    "thus , the dressed quark propagator is traced over and produces a factor @xmath159 of order @xmath118 , as defined in ( [ selfenergy1 ] ) .",
    "the overall contribution of fig.7 to self - energy is therefore @xmath160 which is of order @xmath2 . evidently , the diagram shown in fig.5(a ) is the leading contribution to this quantity",

    "evidently , as @xmath254 ranges over @xmath102 ( which is what we expect to happen in the generic case ) , the eigenvalues of @xmath255 could be smeared ( in the sense that they would not span narrow annuli around the circles @xmath256 . )    the last argument in favor of the  single ring theorem \" clearly breaks down when @xmath254 fails to range over @xmath102 , which occurs when the unitary matrices @xmath248 and @xmath81 are correlated .",
    "for example , @xmath0 may be such that @xmath253 is block diagonal , with the upper diagonal block being a @xmath257 unitary diagonal matrix @xmath258 ( and with @xmath259 a finite fraction of @xmath2 ) . in the extreme case @xmath260 , in which @xmath254 is completely diagonal , @xmath261",
    ", we see that @xmath262 is a _",
    "normal _ matrix ( that is , @xmath263=0 $ ] ) with eigenvalues @xmath264 thus , normal matrices , or partially normal matrices ( i.e. , the case @xmath265 ) , evade the `` single ring '' theorem : if the first @xmath259 eigenvalues @xmath266 of @xmath168 split into several disjoint segments along the positive real axis , the corresponding eigenvalues of @xmath0 will split into concentric annuli in the complex plane obtained by revolving those @xmath267-segments .",
    "normal , or partially normal matrices are , of course , extremely rare in the ensembles of non - hermitean matrices studied in this paper , and do not affect the `` single ring '' behavior of the bulk of matrices in the ensemble .",
    "let us sketch now the proof of the single ring theorem , following @xcite .",
    "thus , let us assume for the moment that the domain of eigenvalues has @xmath140 boundaries .",
    "it is easy to see from ( [ circular ] ) , the defining equation of @xmath90 , that in the annular void @xmath268 in the eigenvalue distribution , @xmath199 is a constant which is equal to the fraction of eigenvalues contained inside the disk @xmath269 .",
    "thus , the equation to determine @xmath199 ( eq . ( [ final ] ) which we repeat here for convenience ) [ final6 ] = 0 must have a series of monotonically increasing constant solutions @xmath270 , which correspond to the various voids .",
    "in particular , from ( [ sumrules ] ) we have @xmath242 for @xmath271 , namely , @xmath187 .",
    "thus , @xmath201 must be a solution of ( [ final6 ] ) , the maximal allowed constant solution , as we already saw following ( [ doubleroot ] ) .",
    "also , if @xmath272 , namely , if there is a hole at the center of the eigenvalue distribution , then for @xmath273 we must have @xmath274 ( independently of @xmath147 ) , which is obviously a solution of ( [ final6 ] ) .",
    "( from the paragraph right below ( [ fff ] ) it is clear that @xmath275 at @xmath276 .",
    "thus @xmath274 is indeed a solution . on the other hand , if @xmath277 , so that the eigenvalue distribution includes the origin , an @xmath147 independent solution @xmath215 is of course only a spurious solution which should be discarded . )    assume now that @xmath278 is an @xmath147 independent solution of ( [ final6 ] ) .",
    "taking the derivative of ( [ final6 ] ) with respect to @xmath214 at @xmath279 we obtain [ gam0 ] _ 0_|_^2= _ 0 _ 0 -1r^2 = 0 , which is the condition for the existence of an @xmath147 independent solution @xmath280 .",
    "thus , there are two possibilities : either @xmath281 , which we already encountered , or @xmath282 .",
    "this equation immediately yields [ fxi ] f(^2)=1 ^ 2 , where the integration constant is fixed by the asymptotic behavior of @xmath283 as @xmath284 .",
    "but for a generic @xmath173 , @xmath172 is given by ( eq .",
    "( [ ff ] ) ) f(w ) = _ 0^ , with ( [ fxi ] ) being the asymptotic behavior of @xmath172 as @xmath285 .",
    "we thus conclude that @xmath286 in ( [ fxi ] ) , namely , that @xmath287 .",
    "thus , to summarize , the only possible @xmath147 independent solutions of ( [ final ] ) are @xmath215 and @xmath201 , which we already discussed .",
    "since no other @xmath147 independent solutions arise , there can be no more than a single void in the eigenvalue distribution , whatever polynomial the potential @xmath173 is .",
    "the shape of the eigenvalue distribution is thus either a disk or an annulus .",
    "interestingly enough , we can arrive at the same conclusion by invoking other general aspects of the method of hermitization , and thus providing a nice self consistency check of our formalism .",
    "recall at this point that the boundaries of the eigenvalue distribution are given by ( [ boundary ] ) , namely , the zeros of @xmath74 . but @xmath74 is given by ( eq .",
    "( [ gg ] ) ) ^2 = ( -1)r^2 , from which we see that at the boundaries @xmath199 can take on only two values : zero and one .",
    "since @xmath199 is a constant in the void , by continuity , these are the only possible values of @xmath199 inside any of the voids .",
    "therefore , there may be two circular boundaries at most .",
    "in other words , as far as the eigenvalue density of @xmath0 is concerned , an ensemble of the form ( [ prob ] ) may have two phases at most , as we concluded earlier .",
    "in addition to @xmath288 ( and possibly @xmath289 ) , ( [ final6 ] ) must have other roots which do depend on @xmath147 .",
    "among all these other roots , we expect to find a unique root @xmath90 , which is a positive monotonically increasing function of @xmath147 , that matches continuously at the boundaries @xmath290 to the constant roots of ( [ final6 ] ) .",
    "the actual @xmath291 of the ensemble ( [ prob ] ) is therefore a continuous monotonically increasing function of @xmath147 , as required by ( [ circular ] ) .",
    "if the eigenvalue distribution is annular with boundaries @xmath292 ( the case @xmath293 corresponding to the full disk ) , it vanishes for @xmath294 , rises monotonically from zero to one on @xmath295 , and equals to one for @xmath296 .",
    "the sextic potential @xmath297 is the potential of lowest degree in ( [ prob ] ) for which the eigenvalues of @xmath168 may split into more then a single segment .",
    "therefore , it is the simplest case in which the single ring theorem has non - trivial consequences .",
    "in fact , it is easy to see that there can be at most two eigenvalue segments in the spectrum of @xmath168 , in which case , one segment touches the origin . in @xcite",
    "we used monte - carlo simulations to generate an ensemble of random matrices ( of size @xmath298 ) corresponding to ( [ prob ] ) with the sextic potential .",
    "the coefficients of the latter were tuned to the phase where the spectrum of @xmath168 splits into two segments .",
    "we verified numerically that the eigenvalue distribution of @xmath0 in this phase was always a disk , and not a disk surrounded by a concentric annulus .",
    "according to the  single ring \" theorem , the eigenvalue distribution of @xmath0 is either a disk or an annulus .",
    "the behavior of @xmath172 as @xmath299 turns out to be an indicator as to which phase of the two the system is in @xcite , as i now show :    _ a. disk phase : _  in the disk phase we expect that @xmath300 , as in ginibre s case .",
    "thus , from ( [ rhocirc ] ) @xmath301 and from the first sum rule @xmath192 in ( [ sumrules ] ) we conclude that [ near0 ] ( r)~12 ( 0 ) r^2 near @xmath241 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath147 small , ( [ final ] ) yields [ near00 ] f(-(0 ) r^42 + ) ~- 1r^2 , namely , @xmath302 for @xmath299 , as we could have anticipated from ginibre s case .",
    "this means that in the disk phase we must set @xmath209 in ( [ fff ] ) .",
    "consequently , in the disk phase @xmath210 does not vanish .",
    "we can do even better : paying attention to the coefficients in ( [ fff ] ) and ( [ p ] ) ( with @xmath209 ) we immediately obtain from ( [ near00 ] ) that [ rho0 ] c_-1 = .    _",
    "b. annular phase : _ in the annular phase @xmath90 must clearly vanish identically in the inner void of the annulus .",
    "thus , ( [ final ] ) implies that @xmath172 can not have a pole at @xmath276 , and therefore from ( [ fff ] ) we must have @xmath303 .",
    "thus , the annulus must arise for @xmath208 ( the other possible solution @xmath304 leads to a disk configuration with @xmath215 only at @xmath241 , as we just discussed . )    thus , to summarize , in the disk phase @xmath131 has the form [ fdisk ] f_disk(w)=12v(w)- ( w^-1 + c_0 + c_1  w + + c_p-2  w^p-2 ) , while in the annular phase it has the form [ fannulus ] f_annulus(w)=12v(w)-(c_0 + c_1  w + + c_p-2  w^p-2 ) .",
    "having determined @xmath172 in this way , i.e. , having determined the various unknown parameters in ( [ fdisk ] ) or in ( [ fannulus ] ) , we substitute it into ( [ final ] ) and find @xmath72 .",
    "we can thus calculate the density of eigenvalues @xmath305 explicitly for an arbitrary @xmath81 .",
    "_ c. the disk - annulus phase transition : _ we now turn to the disk - annulus phase transition .",
    "an important feature of this transition is that @xmath172 is continuous through it . to see this we argue as follows : by tuning the couplings in @xmath81",
    ", we can induce a phase transition from the disk phase into the annular phase , or vice versa .",
    "note , of course , that we can parametrize any point in the disk phase either by the set of couplings in @xmath81 or by the set of parameters @xmath306 in ( [ fdisk ] ) .",
    "the  coordinate transformation \" between these two sets of parameters is encoded in the asymptotic behavior of @xmath172 .",
    "similarly , we can parametrize any point in the annular phase either by the set of couplings in @xmath81 or by the set of parameters @xmath307 in ( [ fannulus ] ) . due to the one - to - one relation ( in a given phase ,",
    "once we have established it is the stable one ) between the couplings in @xmath81 and the parameters in @xmath308 ( namely , the @xmath309 s and the locations of the branch points of @xmath172 ) , we can describe the disk - annulus transition in terms of the latter parameters ( instead of the couplings in @xmath81 ) .",
    "clearly , the transition point is reached from the disk phase when @xmath310 , that is , when @xmath210 in ( [ fdisk ] ) vanishes : [ cminus1crit ] c_-1^crit = 0 . similarly , the transition point is reached from the annular phase when the lower branch point @xmath311 in ( [ fannulus ] ) vanishes .",
    "thus , e.g. , in a transition from the disk phase into the annular phase , @xmath312 in ( [ fdisk ] ) would cross - over continuously into @xmath313 in ( [ fannulus ] ) through a critical form [ fcrit ] f_crit(w)=12v_crit(w)-(c^crit_0 + c^crit_1  w + + c^crit_p-2  w^p-2 ) .",
    "the continuity of @xmath172 through the transition was demonstrated explicitly in @xcite for the quartic ensemble @xmath314 .",
    "this discussion obviously generalizes to cases when @xmath172 has multiple cuts , which correspond to condensation of the eigenvalues of @xmath168 into many segments .",
    "if @xmath276 is a branch point of @xmath172 , that is , if the lowest cut extends to the origin , we are in the disk phase , [ fdisk1 ] f_disk(w)=12v(w)-(c_-1w^-1 + c_0 + c_1  w + + c_p-2  w^p-2 ) , with @xmath315 .",
    "the relation ( [ rho0 ] ) then generalizes to [ rho00 ] c_-1 = . since @xmath210 must be real",
    "we conclude that such a configuration exists only for @xmath140 odd",
    ".    if the lowest branch point in @xmath172 is positive , we are in the annular phase with [ fannulus1 ] f_annulus(w)=12v(w)-(c_0 + c_1  w + + c_p-2  w^p-2 ) .",
    "the phase transition would occur when the couplings in @xmath173 are tuned such that @xmath312 and @xmath313 match continuously , as was described in the previous paragraph .",
    "remarkably , with a minimal amount of effort , and based on the mere definition of @xmath172 ( eq . ( [ ff ] ) ) , we were able to derive in @xcite simple expressions for the location of the boundaries of the eigenvalue distribution and also for the boundary values of @xmath305 in terms of the moments of @xmath316 , which , i remind the reader , is the density of eigenvalues for a hermitean matrix problem .    to this end",
    "it is useful to rewrite our master formula ( [ final ] ) for @xmath191 as [ fin ] w f(w ) = with [ w ] w = r^2 - 1 .",
    "we start with the outer edge @xmath317 ( either in the disk phase or in the annular phase . ) near the outer edge @xmath318 , and thus @xmath319 .",
    "we therefore expand @xmath172 in ( [ fin ] ) in powers of @xmath320 . as can be seen from ( [ ff ] ) , the coefficient of @xmath321 in this expansion is the @xmath39-th moment [ moments ] < ^k > = _ 0^ ( ) ^k dof @xmath316 ( which is of course normalized to 1 . ) for the class of models we are interested in here , all the moments @xmath322 are finite . from the expanded form of ( [ fin ] )",
    "one can obtain , by a straightforward calculation @xcite , that [ rout ] r_out^2 = < > and [ rhoout ] ( r_out ) = 2r_out^2 - < > ^2 .",
    "thus , @xmath323 is simply the first moment of @xmath316 , and the density @xmath324 is inversely proportional to the variance of @xmath325 .    for the @xmath316 under consideration here ,",
    "@xmath326 , and consequently @xmath324 , are always finite . outside the boundary @xmath305",
    "vanishes identically , of course , and thus , @xmath305 always  falls off a cliff \" at the boundary , for all probability distributions of the form ( [ prob ] ) with @xmath81 polynomial",
    ". it would be thus interesting to study circularly invariant matrix ensembles @xmath327 such that the eigenvalue distribution @xmath316 of @xmath168 has a finite @xmath328 but an infinite @xmath326 .",
    "then @xmath324 would vanish .",
    "this would naturally raise the question whether in such situations , @xmath305 behaves universally near the edge ( that is , if near the edge it vanishes like @xmath329 with @xmath37 being some universal exponent ) .",
    "we now turn to the annular phase , and focus on the inner edge @xmath330 of the annulus . according to the discussion in the previous section ( see eq .",
    "( [ fannulus ] ) and the discussion above it ) , @xmath207 in ( [ fff ] ) , and thus @xmath172 is analytic in the domain @xmath331 .",
    "we therefore expand @xmath172 in ( [ fin ] ) in powers of @xmath196 . as can be seen from ( [ ff ] ) , the coefficient of @xmath332 in this expansion is the negative moment [ negmoments ] = _ 0^_annulus ( ) 1^k dof @xmath333 from ( [ fff ] ) ( or ( [ fannulus ] ) ) it is possible to see that all these negative moments of @xmath334 exist . from this expanded form of ( [ fin ] )",
    "one can obtain , again , by a straightforward calculation @xcite , that [ rin ] 1r^2_in = and [ rhoin ] ( r_in ) = 2r_in^-6 - < ^-1>^2 .",
    "thus , @xmath335 is simply the @xmath336 moment of @xmath337 , and the density @xmath324 is inversely proportional to the variance of @xmath338 since @xmath339 are finite , @xmath340 jumps from zero ( in the inner void of the annulus ) to a finite value at the inner edge @xmath341 .",
    "it can be shown @xcite , however , that when @xmath342 , that is , in the annular to disk transition , @xmath343 remains finite , but @xmath344 diverges like @xmath345 .",
    "thus , from ( [ rin ] ) we see that @xmath346 , the _ critical _ inner radius , is finite .",
    "the annulus starts up with a finite inner radius .",
    "also , in this limit , we see from ( [ rhoin ] ) that @xmath347 vanishes like @xmath348 . as we approach the annulus - disk transition , the discontinuity in @xmath305 at the ( finite ) inner edge disappears .",
    "we saw at the end of the previous section ( see eqs .",
    "( [ fdisk ] ) -([fcrit ] ) ) that @xmath172 is continuous through the disk - annulus phase transition .",
    "thus , our master formula @xmath349 to determine @xmath90 ( eq . ( [ fin ] ) ) is also continuous through the transition .",
    "consequently , @xmath350 must remain continuous through the disk - annulus transition , and has ( at the transition ) the universal behavior described in the previous paragraph .",

    "<S> i open by explaining why the bag of tools used regularly in analyzing hermitean random matrices can not be applied directly to analyze non - hermitean matrices , and then introduce the method of hermitization , which solves this problem . </S>",
    "<S> then , for rotationally invariant ensembles , i derive a master equation for the average density of eigenvalues in the complex plane , in the limit of infinitely large matrices . </S>",
    "<S> this is achieved by resumming all the planar diagrams which appear in the perturbative expansion of the hermitized green function . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , this resummation can be carried _ explicitly _ for any rotationally invariant ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> i prove that in the limit of infinitely large matrices , the shape of the eigenvalue distribution is either a disk or an annulus . </S>",
    "<S> this is the celebrated `` single - ring '' theorem . </S>",
    "<S> which of these shapes is realized is determined by the parameters ( coupling constants ) which determine the ensemble . by varying these parameters </S>",
    "<S> a phase transition may occur between the two possible shapes . </S>",
    "<S> i briefly discuss the universal features of this transition . as the analysis of this problem relies heavily on summation of planar feynman diagrams , </S>",
    "<S> i take special effort at presenting a pedagogical exposition of the diagrammatic method , which some readers may find useful . </S>"
