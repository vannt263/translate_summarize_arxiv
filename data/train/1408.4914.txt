    "in the past few years , exactly one - dimensional quantum wires have become available for experimental investigation in the form of carbon nanotubes , chains of metal atoms or weakly side - coupled molecular chains in solids .",
    "the new data emerging from these experiments @xcite , in particular in non - equilibrium situations , require a more detailed and more general theoretical description than presently available .",
    "electron transport in nanowires has been studied theoretically for more than two decades . in the first papers it was found that electron - electron interaction affects even the conductance of a clean wire @xcite . in the case of realistic boundary conditions , namely adiabatically attaching ideal leads to the interacting quantum wire , the two - point conductance of a clean wire is that of the leads , equal to one conductance quantum per channel , irrespective of the ( forward scattering ) interaction @xcite .",
    "the work of kane and fisher @xcite and furusaki and nagaosa @xcite showed , that interaction has a dramatic effect on the conductance in the presence of a potential barrier .",
    "namely , for repulsive interaction these authors found that the conductance tends to zero as the temperature @xmath2 , or more generally , the excitation energy of the electrons approaches zero , while for attractive interaction the conductance scales to its maximum value .",
    "this behavior has been shown to carry over to the dependence on bias voltage , at sufficiently low temperatures ( and for long wires ) .",

    "the transport through luttinger liquid junctions at not too strong interaction has also been calculated using the functional renormalization group method as reviewed in @xcite .",
    "the results mentioned above have been mostly obtained within the bosonization method , which needs to be amended by a correction taking care of the physical situation of a wire of finite length attached to reservoirs ( see above ) .",
    "experimentally , the predictions of theory have been found to be observed , at least qualitatively @xcite .",
    "a proper treatment of the two - point conductance in the limit of weak interaction , taking into account the gradual build - up of the friedel oscillations around the barrier as the infrared cutoff is lowered has been given by yue , glazman and matveev @xcite .",

    "to transport under stationary non - equilibrium conditions .",
    "following our extensive work on transport in the linear regime through junctions of luttinger liquids at arbitrary strength of interaction @xcite we derive in the following rg - equations for the conductance at finite bias voltage and for any interaction strength .",
    "we use the fact that the @xmath4- function of the rg - equation for the conductance can be obtained in very good approximation by summing a class of contributions in perturbation theory in all orders of the interaction @xcite . a comparison of our previous results on the linear response conductances of two- @xcite and three - lead junctions @xcite with or without additional symmetries , or an applied magnetic flux aristov2012a , aristov2013 , with the results of the bosonization method , of conformal field theory methods , of bethe ansatz , where available , are in full agreement provided those results were well - founded . in a few cases where the conformal field theory result was based on an additional assumption we found disagreement , which we interpret as saying that the assumption was not justified .    in this paper",

    "far out of equilibrium it would be too costly to perform a similar direct computation of all contributions up to third order .",
    "instead we assume that even out of equilibrium we have the scaling property and the scaling exponents are fully determined by the contribution provided by the approximation of fully dressing the interaction line of the one - loop calculation .",
    "this assumption may be justified by at least two facts .",

    "it may therefore be expected that the structure of the scale - dependent terms generated by the cutoff @xmath1 is analogous to that of the terms generated by the cutoff @xmath2 or @xmath201 .",
    "no additional scale dependent terms are found in non - equilibrium and none of the scale - dependent terms present in equilibrium disappears in non - equilibrium .",
    "this suggests that the structure of the scale - dependent terms is preserved and therefore the scaling property is preserved even out of equilibrium . secondly ,",
    "as will be shown below , the results of our theory are in agreement with exact results obtained by other methods .",
    "we now briefly review the logic by which the rg - equation is derived from the perturbative result .",

    "this leads to the definition of the rg @xmath214-function @xmath215 our earlier direct third order calculation in @xcite showed that the above ratio was indeed independent of @xmath95 to the considered accuracy @xmath216 .",

    "this term is subleading in the sense that it vanishes more rapidly on approach to the fixed points at @xmath219 than the first term and does therefore not influence the critical properties .",
    "there are indications that this is also the case with the higher order contributions not captured by the ladder summation .",
    "a similar conclusion regarding the relative unimportance of corrections beyond the ladder summation @xmath200 was reached in aristov2011 for the more general case of the three - lead y - junction . in the symmetrical setup the y - junction",
    "was characterized by two conductances , and after extensive computer analysis of perturbative corrections we arrived at a set of two coupled rg equations .",
    "we found that the three - loop corrections , not contained in the ladder series of diagrams , did not contribute to the scaling exponents .",
    "we expect that non - universal contributions to the @xmath220function will also exist in the case of non - equilibrium , but those terms will again be unimportant when it comes to determine the critical behavior at the fixed points .",

    "electron transport through one - dimensional quantum wires of various types has been studied experimentally in several recent works . in a typical set - up stationary charge transport",
    "is measured in a two - point geometry of a system of one or several wires connected by a junction .",
    "the quantum wires are adiabatically connected to reservoirs kept at a fixed chemical potential and temperature .",
    "these systems are described by modeling the quantum wires as luttinger liquids ( spinless , or spinful ) of fermions with linear dispersion subject to point - like interaction and treating the reservoirs as non - interacting .",
    "a useful picture of the transport process is to think of individual electrons entering the interaction region ( quantum wires plus junction ) from an initial reservoir and leaving as individual electrons into the final reservoir .",
    "if we model the reservoirs as non - interacting systems there is no room for collective excitations such as fractional quasiparticles or multiple quasiparticles in the final state .",
    "conventionally this problem has been addressed by the bosonization method , which takes advantage of the fact that the exact excitations of a clean luttinger wire are bosons , at least in the infinite wire .",
    "the problem of including the transformation of incoming electrons into bosons has been addressed for the clean wire , and is believed to be solved . for the case of semi - wires connected by a junction there is no convincing calculation of the above transformation available . in order to avoid this difficulty we are using a fermionic representation .",
    "our approach starts with determining the leading scale - dependent contributions to the conductances in all orders of perturbation theory .",
    "we have demonstrated in the linear response case that by summing up these terms one arrives at a description of the critical properties near the fixed points ( i.e. the location of the fps and the critical exponents describing the power laws followed by the conductances ) .",
    "for this it is necessary to establish the scaling property of the conductances ( or else to assume its validity , which is usually done ) , allowing to derive a set of renormalization group equations out of the perturbative result .    in the present paper we followed this approach for the case of stationary non - equilibrium transport .",
    "we first derived a general result for the scale - dependent terms in the conductances of an @xmath9-lead junction in first order of the interaction .",

    "the usual summation over the quantum states in the infinite medium is done as an integration over the momentum @xmath278 or the summation , @xmath279 over the quasi - momentum @xmath280 in a ring geometry with a finite length @xmath23 . in our situation with a broken translational symmetry we should resort to the integration over the energy ,",
    "then the correct normalization factor is given by the density of states , which is the inverse fermi velocity in the simplest situation , @xmath281 . in case with several fermi velocities , @xmath35 , in different wires",
    "we shall keep the integration over the energy , and the normalization factor enters the definition of the wave functions .",
    "thus in the formula for the retarded green s function , @xmath282 we adopt the wave functions in the @xmath13th wire in the form @xmath283 and come to the formula ( [ eq : green ] ) .",
    "notice also that the integration in ( [ app : defgreen ] ) should be restricted by the electronic bandwidth @xmath284 , with the property @xmath285 .",
    "so strictly speaking the formulas ( [ eq : green ] ) are defined at @xmath286 , which justifies the upper cutoff in energy in the calculation of logarithmic corrections and the rg procedure .",
