    "proton decay is one of the most exciting predictions of grand unified theories ( guts ) .",
    "experimental effort over the years has pushed the lower limit on the partial lifetimes to @xmath2 years and @xmath3 years at the 90% confidence level@xcite , and further improvement is expected from the superkamiokande experiment .",
    "a crucial link to relate these numbers to constraints on ( susy-)gut models is the values of hadron matrix elements relevant for proton decay .",
    "model calculations suffer from high degree of uncertainty , various estimations easily differing by a factor ten .",
    "pioneering lattice qcd studies to remove this source of uncertainty were made about ten years ago , first combining calculations of the matrix element @xmath4 and soft - pion theorems to estimate @xmath5@xcite , and subsequently directly evaluating the matrix element @xmath5 itself@xcite .    in this article",
    "we report preliminary results of our renewed effort to determine the matrix elements from first principles of qcd .",
    "in addition to the use of larger lattice sizes and higher statistics to achieve a much better precision , which is made possible through the increase of computing power , we aim to advance the calculation on two fronts : ( i ) calculation of @xmath6 matrix elements relevant for susy - gut as well as those for the @xmath7 mode , for physical values of @xmath8-@xmath9 and @xmath10 quark masses and for physical momenta , and ( ii ) evaluation of matrix elements of all dimension-6 baryon number violating operators classified according to @xmath11 invariance@xcite , so as to cover various gut models and decay processes .",
    "our calculation is carried out in quenched qcd at @xmath12=6.1 with the wilson quark action on a @xmath0 lattice .",
    "we analyze 100 configurations for the hopping parameter @xmath13=0.15428 , 0.15381 , 0.15333 , 0.15287 .",
    "the lattice scale fixed by @xmath14mev in the chiral limit ( @xmath15 ) equals @xmath16gev , and the point for strange quark estimated from @xmath17 is given by @xmath18 .",
    "all errors are estimated by the single elimination jackknife procedure .    to calculate the nucleon ( @xmath19 ) to pseudo scalar ( ps ) meson matrix element of a baryon number violating operator @xmath20",
    ", we form the ratio , @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are extracted from local - local hadron propagators .",
    "we fix the nucleon source at @xmath24=0 , ps sink at @xmath25 and move the operator between them .",
    "matrix elements are evaluated for four spatial momenta @xmath26=(0,0,0 ) , ( 1,0,0 ) , ( 0,1,0 ) , ( 0,0,1 ) in units of minimum momentum @xmath27 injected in the ps meson .",
    "we distinguish @xmath8-@xmath9 and @xmath10 quark masses ; the former is taken to the chiral limit , and the latter interpolated to the physical @xmath10 quark mass in our calculations .",
    "after this procedure , we interpolate the spatial momentum to the physical value .",
    "matrix elements are renormalized , with mixing included , by tadpole - improved one - loop renormalization factors to the @xmath28 scheme@xcite calculated at the scale @xmath29 .",
    "let us define the @xmath30 and @xmath31 matrix elements @xmath32 and @xmath33 by @xmath34 in fig .",
    "[ fig : qmass ] we show our results for these matrix elements at zero momentum @xmath35 , normalized by proton mass measured for relevant values of @xmath8-@xmath9 quark mass . for @xmath32 ,",
    "abscissa represents the @xmath8-@xmath9 quark mass , while it represents the @xmath10 quark mass for @xmath33 , the @xmath8-@xmath9 quark mass having been taken to the chiral limit .",
    "compared to a first calculation of the @xmath32 matrix element@xcite , whose results are consistent with ours , our statistical errors of 48% are improved by about a factor five .",
    "this allows us to observe that the amplitude exhibits a clear decrease of about 40% from the region of @xmath10 quark ( @xmath36 ) to the chiral limit , which was not apparent in results of ref .",
    "@xcite .    for the @xmath31 matrix elements",
    "@xmath33 , after chiral extrapolation of @xmath8-@xmath9 quark mass , the dependence on the @xmath10 quark mass is small .",
    "the point plotted with a cross shows the value interpolated to the physical @xmath10 quark mass .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mom ] we plot @xmath32 and @xmath33 as a function of squared momentum after quark masses are taken to the physical values .",
    "we observe a quite significant momentum dependence for both amplitudes , necessitating an interpolation for a precise estimate of their physical values .",
    "the open circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : mom ] show results of a linear interpolation in @xmath37 to physical momentum .",
    "phenomenological analyses of proton decay often employ the soft - pion relation@xcite @xmath38 to estimate the @xmath30 matrix element , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the axial vector matrix elements of proton . with our results for physical quark masses and momentum ,",
    "the right hand - side is about four times larger than the left hand - side of this relation .",
    "a similar discrepancy was observed in ref .",
    "@xcite . examining the above relation for zero pion momentum in the chiral limit , _",
    "i.e. , _ the real soft - pion limit , we find that the two sides are still discrepant by about a factor two .",
    "the origin of the discrepancy is not clear to us at present .",
    "we plot our preliminary results for matrix elements normalized by proton mass squared relevant for @xmath41 and @xmath42 decay in fig.[fig : amp ] . for comparison ,",
    "predictions from tree - level chiral lagrangian with a choice of the parameters @xmath43 @xmath44 are shown , which represent the smallest values among various model estimations . here",
    "@xmath45 and @xmath12 are defined as @xmath46 .",
    "our lattice results are even smaller for some of the channels , and predictions for the ratio of @xmath47 and @xmath48 amplitudes are also different .    for non - susy minimal su(5 ) gut , the decay width for the @xmath30 mode",
    "is given by@xcite @xmath49 employing the gut gauge coupling @xmath50 and the short distance renormalization factor @xmath51 at @xmath52 as in ref .",
    "@xcite , substituting our preliminary result for @xmath32 yields @xmath53 years where the error is only statistical .",
