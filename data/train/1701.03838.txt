    "magnetic particle imaging ( mpi )  @xcite device has yet to be introduced into clinical practice .",
    "one of the challenges has been the ability upscaling the gradient coils to surround a human body while been able to generate and to drive a sufficiently strong gradient of the magnetic field .",
    "these requirements , however , make a demand on a prohibitively high power consumption in the device with the cylindrical geometry . therefore alternative topologies such as an open geometry scanner would be highly desirable .",
    "one way to make such a practical mpi device is to use a single - sided geometry  @xcite .",
    "the single - sided device has all the hardware on one side from the imaging volume and therefore such a device can be used equally on small animals and humans , as well as an mpi spectrometer for medical and material surveys . due to inherent geometrical constrains , _",
    "i.e. _ lack of counteractive coils in the parallel configuration there is a significant challenge in the implementation of such devices . to date",
    ", only one type of a single - sided ffp - based device has been demonstrated  @xcite .",
    "here we propose a novel design of selection - drive ( sd ) coils for a single - sided device that is capable of 3-d image encoding .",
    "moreover , different from the recent field - free point ( ffp ) based developments  @xcite , in our geometry we utilize a more sensitive field - free line ( ffl ) configuration  @xcite .",
    "the design is capable generating a sufficient magnetic field gradient and drive fields so that the ffl can travel across a volume of a small animal or penetrate deep enough into human organs such as in the vascular or lymphatic systems for sentinel lymph node biopsy  @xcite .",
    "the apparatus and the topology of ffl - based selection coils are shown in fig .",
    "[ setup ] . in general such selection coils consist of several elongated coils placed in parallel to each other . to create a static ffl at some height @xmath0 from the surface of the coils only the two coils are required ( top coils ( 1,2 ) in fig .",
    "[ setup ] ) . to understand the principle of ffl generation above the surface",
    "let us consider four parallel infinite conductors .",
    "the superposition of the magnetic fields from these conductors is shown in fig .",
    "[ vector](a ) .",
    "the two innermost conductors with the equal counter - propagating current create @xmath1 field , which is oriented along @xmath2 in the isoplane ( @xmath3 ) . in order to get a field zero line in that plane an additional bias field @xmath4",
    "is required .",
    "such a field oriented along @xmath5 can be created by two outer conductors with the equal dc counter - propagating current  @xcite .",
    "if we assume infinite length conductors and neglect their finite cross - sections , then from biot - savart law the total @xmath6 field is given by    @xmath7    where @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the permeability of free space , @xmath10 is the ratio of the currents in the pairs of the outer and the inner conductors , @xmath11 is the ratio of the separations of the outer @xmath12 and inner @xmath13 conductors . by setting @xmath14 in eq .",
    "[ field ] we can obtain the height of the ffl as a function of @xmath15 to be @xmath16 eq .  [ height ] defines the critical current ratio @xmath17 so that @xmath18 for the ffl to be above the surface at a finite height .",
    "the gradient of the magnetic field at @xmath19 is given by    @xmath20    where @xmath21 .",
    "the gradient can be maximized for a certain current ratio given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 . when the conductors are equally spaced so that @xmath24 then from eq .",
    "[ gradient ] the maximum gradient for the given @xmath25 is @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "figure  [ vector](b ) shows the dependence of the normalized height of ffl and the normalized gradient vs current ratio @xmath15 .",
    "different from the ideal four - wire geometry for the elongated coils , the current @xmath28 must be the same in all four conductors , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath29 , thus the ffl height _",
    "h _ is independent on the current amplitude . as shown in fig .",
    "[ vector](b ) the maximum gradient can not be reached at @xmath30 and an independent current control is required that can be achieved by the additional coil . from eq .",
    "[ height ] setting @xmath31 we obtain the position of ffl above the surface to be @xmath32 , which does not take into account the finite cross - sections of the conductors .",
    "we note that , the finite length of the coils contributes to the curvature of the ffl along @xmath33 .",
    "for equally spaced conductors.,width=2 ]      while two elongated coils are necessary and sufficient to generate a stationary ffl at a fixed height , for mpi it is required to repetitively move the ffl in space . an arbitrary translation of the ffl in two orthogonal directions _ x , z _ can be accomplished by means of three more elongated coils positioned under the selection coils ( 1,2 ) .",
    "such a three - coil array consists of all equal and equidistant coils with their cores shifted with respect to the top layer by half a separation distance as shown in fig .",
    "[ setup ] .",
    "we note that the same method of equivalent conductors , in principle , can be applied to the array of five coils positioned in the same top layer so that the coils ( 4,5 ) surround coils ( 1,2 ) and the latter surround coil ( 3 ) , however , this configuration is less power efficient due to wider separation per unit conductor size .",
    "let us first consider the depth encoding by sd coils .",
    "a drive field @xmath34 is required in order to shift the height of the ffl in the isoplane so the total field in the isoplane is : @xmath35 that can be achieved by the drive coil ( 3 ) , which is located at @xmath3 . since the two long conductors of that coil directly overlap with the inner conductors of the top coils ( see fig .  [ setup](a ) ) , the ac current        @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the drive frequency and @xmath38 is the current amplitude ratio , effectively modulates the dc current @xmath28 in the two inner conductors of the selection coils thus breaking the current degeneracy of the elongated loop conductors .",
    "therefore the three - coil array creates an equivalent of the ideal four conductor configuration as shown in fig .",
    "[ current](a ) , which is required to move the ffl in the isoplane with relatively large displacements described by eq .",
    "[ height ] .",
    "setting @xmath39 and @xmath40 we can apply the theory developed in sec .",
    "[ station ] .",
    "thus we get a time - dependent current ratio @xmath41 , from which the critical condition is @xmath42 or @xmath43 .",
    "the maximum gradient is obtained for @xmath44 .",
    "this method , in principle , can provide a fast ( @xmath45  khz ) and sensitive 1-d mpi along the _ z_-axis .",
    "another way to achieve depth modulation is to utilize the bias field generated by a pair of outer coils ( 4,5 ) with ac current @xmath46 in each coil    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is the drive frequency , @xmath49 is the current amplitude ratio , and @xmath50 is the phase . if the current in both coils fed in - phase ( see the diagram in fig .",
    "[ current](b ) ) then the drive field @xmath51 competes with the selection field generated by the static coils ( 1,2 ) according to eq .",
    ".  [ field ] can be applied for the coils ( 4,5 ) with the modified separation ratio @xmath52 and the current ratio @xmath31 .",
    "it can be shown that only one field zero exists above the surface in this configuration .",
    "the assembly of four - element coil array ( 1,2,4,5 ) effectively provides an ideal six - conductor configuration as shown in fig .",
    "[ current](b ) .",
    "we can estimate the displacement by noticing that for @xmath53 we get @xmath54 ( see fig .",
    "[ current](b ) ) , so the equivalent geometry with four conductors has @xmath55 . therefore the positive phase of @xmath46 provides @xmath56 so the total displacement around the base height is @xmath57 .    the two methods of the depth encoding described above can be used independently to adjust the gradient of the magnetic field at the different heights and to correct the ffl height during in - plane displacements that are valuable for multidimensional mpi .    to utilize in - plane projection reconstruction algorithms",
    "@xcite it is required to oscillate ffl along @xmath58 for each rotation step , which can be done with an external bias field oriented along @xmath58 that effectively shifts the isoplane .",
    "this x - drive field can be generated by the pair of the outer coils ( 4,5 ) that are driven _ out - of - phase _ as shown in in fig .",
    "[ current](c ) .",
    "such an equivalent six - conductor geometry produces asymmetric current pattern @xmath59 with respect to the isoplane that moves the ffl position along the magnetic field lines @xmath60 in the _ xz_-plane .",
    "the total field is : @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",
    "this x - drive field can produce an oscillating ffl according to eq .",
    "[ zdrive2 ] .",
    "thus the in - plane ( _ xy _ ) encoding can be implemented through a projection imaging by a mechanical rotation of the device or a subject around @xmath5 up to 180@xmath63 while oscillating the ffl along @xmath58 .",
    "[ bx ] assumes a uniform x - drive field @xmath64 .",
    "this condition , however , holds only for the displacements @xmath65 . at the larger displacements the x - drive magnetic field lines bend so that @xmath66",
    "that results in the x - dependent ffl height variation @xmath67 .",
    "for the small field curvatures @xmath68 , where @xmath69 .",
    "this height variations can be corrected by applying an additional bias field @xmath70 , which can be achieved by modulating the current in the coil ( 3 ) or the coils ( 4,5 ) .",
    "thus for known displacements along @xmath58 we can apply eq .",
    "[ height ] solving for @xmath71 to obtain the modulation current ( @xmath72 or @xmath46 ) amplitude .",
    "the _ xy_-plane encoding can be combined with the fast or relatively slow depth modulation that can be used for the slice selection .",
    "to evaluate the magnetic field generated by the single - sided elongated coil topology we carried out quasi - static simulations using wolfram _",
    "mathematica^^ _ software with _ radia _",
    "package ( esrf , france )  @xcite .",
    "the package allows to calculate flux density @xmath73 ( also called @xmath73 field here ) of a coil by utilizing boundary integral methods .",
    "first we consider a static ffl generated by two selection coils ( see fig .",
    "[ setup ] ) as described in sec .",
    "[ station ] . for practical considerations , we modeled two identical elongated coils for the small - scale mpi scanner using the properties of the actual coil structure described in  @xcite with the following dimensions : @xmath74  mm ( straight length ) , @xmath75  mm ( width ) and aspect ratio of @xmath76 . here ,",
    "each coil consists of @xmath77 layers of conductor with cross - section 6.33 @xmath78 0.3  mm@xmath79 , the core is made of a nonconducting material with the width @xmath80  mm , and the coil separation of @xmath81 , which corresponds to @xmath82 .",
    "let us now consider a design of a coil structure that is capable of multidimensional image encoding .",
    "the model coil assembly consists of the pair of the selection coils in the upper layer and three identical elongated coils in the lower layer that are shifted along",
    "_ x_-axis by @xmath83 with respect to the selection coils as described in sec .  [ operation ] and shown in fig .  [ setup](b ) .",
    "we perform quasi - static field simulations with the reference dc current @xmath84  a in the selection coils and the instantaneous current patterns of @xmath85 corresponding to their positive and negative phases as referenced by the direction of @xmath28 .",
    "the power consumption of the actual electromagnetic coil at the operating current of 100 a is 2.5 kw per coil .",
    "thus the estimated dc power consumption of the mpi device at the specified gradient strength is 5 kw .",

    "thus the depth fov spans @xmath101  cm . due to the inhomogeneity of the field in the asymmetric topology",
    "the gradient strength varies with the height that affects the resolution of mpi , therefore current adjustments are necessary . since the field gradient @xmath102 is proportional to @xmath28 ( see eq .",
