    "degenerate optical parametric oscillators ( dopos ) are nowadays the standard squeezed light source .",
    "let us remind that a light mode is said to be squeezed if the fluctuations in one of its quadratures are below the standard quantum limit , which is defined as the vacuum fluctuations level of that quadrature @xcite . in dopos , squeezing is accomplished thanks to the parametric down  conversion process occurring in the nonlinear crystal together with the interference between the intracavity field and the external vacuum fluctuations that enter into the cavity through the output mirror @xcite .",
    "quantum noise reductions as large as 10db ( 90% ) have been experimentally demonstrated with dopos @xcite .",
    "high precision measurements are perhaps the best known applications of squeezed light @xcite , but applications to quantum information with continuous variables are becoming increasingly important @xcite , as squeezed light is the essential ingredient in generating continuous  variable entanglement .",
    "improving the quality and reliability of squeezing is thus an important goal , but the generation of squeezed light with particular spatial distributions could also be important . this has been shown to be of utility in , e.g. , high precision positioning @xcite . recently",
    "gauss beams are attracting much attention because of the many potential applications of the orbital angular momentum ( oam ) carried by these light beams @xcite , and the generation of non classical laguerre ",
    "gauss modes could thus lead to new phenomena in the interaction between these light fields and matter .",
    "here we consider squeezing generation by means of dopos with large fresnel number cavities composed of spherical mirrors . in such systems ,",
    "the cavity can sustain the nonlinear interaction for several transverse modes ( diffraction losses are ideally suppressed ) giving rise to new results concerning squeezing .",
    "quantum fluctuations in large fresnel number cavities have been studied in the past , and new phenomena resulting from the interplay between quantum fluctuations and transverse pattern formation have been predicted .",
    "concerning cavities composed of planar mirrors , the phenomena of quantum images @xcite ( below threshold ) and the perfect noncritical squeezing of the emerging transverse pattern linear momentum @xcite ( above threshold ) have been predicted . regarding spherical mirrors , only below threshold operation has been studied @xcite , showing that also in this case there appear quantum images anticipating the above threshold pattern .",
    "here we consider a dopo cavity with spherical mirrors that is pumped by a gaussian mode .",
    "the novelty of our work with respect to previous analyses of large fresnel number dopos consists in that we study the system above its oscillation threshold , while previous works have treated the below threshold case @xcite .",
    "this has lead us to quantum fluctuations phenomena that have not been previously described . specifically",

    "the squeezing properties of this mode turn out to coincide with those derived in the past , as the case @xmath7 is equivalent to the standard dopo model @xcite , and the case @xmath10 generalizes what has recently been described in @xcite . after reviewing the squeezing properties of cases @xmath11 and @xmath1 in subsection iv.a",
    ", we concentrate in the squeezing properties of the rest of modes ( those with @xmath12 that remain off when the dopo is above threshold ) in subsection iv.b . in this last subsection",
    "we will demonstrate the main result of the present work , namely that certain combinations of opposite oam modes exhibit large squeezing ( which is larger for the larger values of @xmath0 and the lower values of @xmath13 ) .",
    "remarkably , this squeezing is noncritical , i.e. , is independent of the pumping value and admits a simple explanation ( subsection iv.c ) .",
    "we find that this new result is relevant because it establishes a simple way for generating squeezed vacua with shapes different from the gaussian or the tem@xmath14 modes . in section",
    "v we review the main conclusions of our work .",

    "hence , by solving the langevin equations for the amplitudes @xmath79 in terms of the noises @xmath80 , one is able to obtain the variances of the quadratures involved in the problem , and thus the squeezing properties of the field .",

    "we are going to distinguish between the special cases @xmath114 on one hand and cases with @xmath12 , as their properties turn out to be quite different .      here",

( [ parameters ] ) , ( [ coupling ] ) and ( [ il ] ) ] ) . moreover , eqs . ( [ l0 ] ) coincide with those for the paradigmatic single - mode dopo ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , while eqs .",
    "( [ l1 ] ) do with those for the recently studied dopo tuned to its first transverse mode family @xcite .",
    "the conclusions are straightforward :    * for any even @xmath0 ( @xmath7 ) the quantum properties of the classically excited mode coincide with those of the usual single - mode dopo in the linear approximation . at threshold ( @xmath88 )",
    "ideal squeezing is predicted in this approximation and this squeezing degrades as we move apart from threshold .",
    "that is why we speak about _ critical squeezing _ in this case , as the system parameters need to be tuned to a particular value for obtaining the optimum squeezing level . in mathematical terms",
    ", this is a consequence of the existence , at the bifurcation point , of a null eigenvalue and of a companion negative eigenvalue that reaches its minimum possible value .",
    "the former is the responsible for the `` infinite ''  fluctuations of the amplitude quadrature of the signal mode ( which is proportional to the eigenvector associated to the null eigenvalue ) , while the latter is the responsible of the complete suppression ( in the linear approximation ) of the fluctuations in the signal mode phase quadrature .",

    "is always zero ( the eigenvector associated to this eigenvalue is said to be a goldstone mode ) , reflecting the indeterminacy of the phase difference between the two signal modes [ see eq .",
    "( [ stationary above ] ) ] .",
    "this phase difference is nothing but the orientation of the emitted hybrid mode ( the tem@xmath14 mode in @xcite ) that results from the coherent superposition of the @xmath119 and @xmath120 modes .",
    "thus the physical meaning of the goldstone mode is that the orientation of the signal mode emitted above threshold by this dopo  diffuses with time , and is thus undetermined .",
    "this eigenvalue is accompanied by another eigenvalue which always takes its minimum possible value , with the consequence that the amplitude of its associated eigenvector has no fluctuations at all .",
    "this last eigenvector can be easily identified with the oam of the emitted pattern , which is nothing but another hybrid mode spatially crossed ( orthogonal )  with respect to the bright one .",
    "this shows that the generation of noncritical squeezing through the spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking mechanism is not particular of the model considered in @xcite , but should be a general phenomenon .",
    "we address the reader to @xcite for full details of this phenomenon .",
    "in this case the amplitudes @xmath121 and @xmath122 are very small ( they are null in the classical limit even if the system is above threshold ) and then , in the linear approximation we are considering , the nonlinear function @xmath109 ( [ nl1 ] ) appearing in ( [ quantum eqs ] ) must be evaluated at its classical value ( [ stationary above ] ) as not doing would introduce higher order corrections that must be neglected in the used linear approximation .",
    "one then obtains @xmath123 and the langevin equations become    [ quantum higher]@xmath124 as is evident , the evolution of the different pairs of oam @xmath125 is decoupled , what allows us to analyze separately the quantum properties of each @xmath13 couple .",

    "this is in clear contrast to the perfectly squeezed mode in the @xmath172 case @xcite , which has not an arbitrary orientation but is orthogonal to the classically excited mode at every instant .",
    "of course , the reason is that the modes here analyzed are below their threshold , at difference with the case in @xcite .",
    "so far we have proven that the higher oam modes show noise reduction in their phase quadrature .",

    "the coefficient that rules the squeezing properties of the @xmath173 modes is @xmath118 , see eq .",
    "( [ result ] ) . both above and below threshold",
    ", @xmath118 can be written in terms of the stationary pump field as @xmath174 , see ( [ parameters ] ) .",
    "below threshold @xmath175 increases linearly with the external pump amplitude [ see eq .",
    "( [ stationary below ] ) ] and hence so does @xmath118 .",
    "but once the bifurcation is reached and the dopo starts emitting the @xmath176 mode(s ) , the value of @xmath175 saturates , and remains constant irrespective of the pump value [ see eq .",
    "( [ stationary above ] ) ] leading to @xmath166 above threshold , which is independent of the pump value .",
    "this implies that the value of @xmath118 will remain fixed to that at the bifurcation once the dopo is above threshold and , consequently , the squeezing level of these modes becomes noncritical .",
    "we have shown that tuning large fresnel number dopos with spherical mirrors to transverse families is a simple way for generating squeezed light with the shape of hybrid laguerre ",
    "gauss modes with oam @xmath12 , with @xmath7 or @xmath1 depending on the even or odd character of the selected transverse mode family .",
    "the behavior of the system can be resumed as follows : above threshold , only the hybrid mode with @xmath114 is amplified , and the rest of modes ( those with @xmath12 ) remain off .",
    "the amplified modes exhibit squeezing properties that can be found in the literature ( see @xcite for @xmath7 and @xcite for @xmath10 ) as shown in section iv a.    the surprising result is that hybrid modes with @xmath12 exhibit a large degree of squeezing together with the fact that this squeezing is noncritical , i.e. , it remains fixed irrespective of the pump level when the system is above threshold .",
    "thus , squeezed vacua with the shape of higher order hybrid modes can be generated by normal dopos if these have a large fresnel number .    in our model",
    "we assumed equal cavity losses for all signal modes ( in fact , equal cavity losses for all signal modes belonging to the same family ; this is the precise meaning we give to the expression large fresnel number cavity ) .",
    "as we have explained , the squeezing level of modes with oam @xmath12 depends on the distance between their threshold and that for the mode(s ) with lowest oam @xmath176 .",
    "hence , differences in the values of their decay rates could modify quantitatively the results we have presented , as this would change the threshold for the different modes .",
    "if fact , if tailoring the cavity losses for the different modes would be possible , one could obtain even smaller quantum fluctuations for these empty modes if their corresponding thresholds were made closer to that of the @xmath176 mode .",
    "we also assumed perfect cavity resonance for a particular family of modes .",
    "we do not expect that detuning changes our main conclusions , as detuning affects equally all modes within the same family ( apart , of course , from the fact that if the detuning is half the value the transverse free spectral range , competition phenomena between the involved families will manifest , something that is not considered in our model ) .",
    "adding detuning would have the same consequences as in the single - mode dopo : it will increase the threshold and change the phase of the amplified mode ( and hence of the squeezed quadratures ) .",
    "we finally note that laguerre ",
    "gauss modes are becoming important for several purposes , e.g. in quantum information processing and in manipulation of atoms @xcite just to mention a couple .",
    "we hope that our results can be of relevance as squeezed hybrid modes or , equivalently , entangled laguerre - gauss modes , can be of utility for these purposes .",
