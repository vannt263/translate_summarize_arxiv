    "the presence of liquid films at grain boundaries for temperatures below the melting point can alter macroscopic properties of polycrystalline materials and dramatically reduce resistance to shear stresses .",
    "the latter can lead to catastrophic material failure as exemplified by hot cracking during high - temperature processing of metallic alloys @xcite . while there is indirect experimental evidence for the occurrence of grain - boundary premelting in both pure materials @xcite and alloys @xcite ,",
    "it is inherently difficult to image and to measure thermodynamic properties of nanometer - width liquid films .",
    "one exception is optical microscopy of colloidal crystals , which has produced striking `` atomistic''-scale images of premelted grain boundaries @xcite . even in this case",
    ", however , the lack of precise control of grain geometry and external conditions makes it hard to determine the fundamental nature of the premelting transition .",
    "molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations provide in principle a powerful alternative to experiment for studying grain - boundary premelting .",
    "md studies using lennard - jones @xcite and interatomic potentials for metals @xcite and semiconductors such as silicon @xcite have reported evidence for disordered layers at grain boundaries at different temperatures below @xcite and above @xcite the melting point .",
    "in addition , such layers have been reported to exhibit fluid - like properties in a md study of grain - boundary shearing in a lennard - jones system where the shear modulus decreased sharply below the melting point @xcite .",
    "the large fluctuations inherent in md simulations , however , make it generally hard to compute precisely the thermodynamic properties of grain boundaries at high homologous temperature and to quantify the interaction between crystal - melt interfaces .",
    "a remarkable study of grain - boundary premelting was carried out by kikuchi and cahn @xcite using a lattice gas model and a cluster variation approximation for the evaluation of its thermodynamic properties .",
    "their results were later corroborated by monte carlo simulations of the same model @xcite .",
    "they indeed found a liquid - like layer at the grain boundary for temperatures well below the melting point .",
    "the width of this layer diverges logarithmically when the melting point is approached .",
    "while this study gave valuable insights , it did not yield a complete picture of grain - boundary premelting since the construction of the lattice - gas model leads to numerous geometrical constraints , such that only a single misorientation could be investigated .    from a basic thermodynamic viewpoint ,",
    "grain - boundary premelting is governed by the balance between bulk and interfacial free energies .",
    "while the difference in bulk free energies per unit volume between solid and liquid @xcite , @xmath8 , always favors a crystalline state below the melting point , the interfacial free energy favors the formation of a liquid layer for wetting conditions .",
    "the total excess free energy ( per unit area of grain boundary ) that reflects both contributions can be written in the form @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath2 denotes the liquid layer width and the last two terms on the right - hand - side represent the interfacial free energy .",
    "the latter must reduce to twice the excess free energy of the solid - liquid interface , @xmath10 , when the two solid - liquid interfaces are well separated , but generally contains an additional contribution @xmath1 when their separation becomes comparable to the intrinsic nanometer - width @xmath11 of an isolated solid - liquid interface .",
    "this additional contribution , referred to hereafter as the `` disjoining potential , '' represents the interaction due to the overlap of two solid - liquid interfaces , which drives the formation of a liquid layer under wetting conditions , or conversely joins two crystals for non - wetting conditions .",
    "its derivative @xmath12 is directly analogous to the disjoining pressure used in the physics of thin liquid films @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study grain - boundary premelting using the phase - field crystal ( pfc ) modeling approach @xcite inspired from classical density - functional theory @xcite . in the present context",
    ", this mean - field approach has the advantage of resolving the atomic - scale density - wave structure of a polycrystalline material while , at the same time , averaging out fluctuations .",
    "therefore , it is ideally suited for computing quantitatively the disjoining potential and for elucidating its relationship to atomic grain - boundary structure . in a recent study ,",

    "_ observed melting at grain boundaries in three - dimensional phase - field crystal simulations for bcc ordering @xcite , thereby suggesting the usefulness of this method for investigating fundamental aspects of this phenomenon .",

    "the present work focuses on the quantitative study of premelting in the general framework of eq .",
    "( [ gw ] ) with the appropriate choice of thermodynamic ensemble for the phase - field crystal model , for two - dimensional crystals with hexagonal symmetry .",
    "we compute explicitly the dependence of the disjoining potential on layer width and determine wetting conditions as a function of grain - boundary orientation .",
    "this allows us to make contact with sharp- @xcite and diffuse - interface @xcite theories of interfacial premelting . like md studies with truncated short - range interatomic potentials @xcite",
    ", these theories neglect the effects of long - range dispersion forces considered in statistical theories of grain - boundary melting @xcite and in theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite studies of intergranular phases in ceramic materials .",
    "these forces are also neglected in the present phase - field crystal study that focuses on the structural component of the disjoining potential due to partial crystal ordering within premelted layers .      in the simplest theory ,",
    "a `` wet '' grain boundary is modeled as a thin layer of liquid sandwiched between two solid - liquid boundaries , assumed to be sharp and straight .",
    "if only short - range forces are present , an exponential interaction between the interfaces is expected for large film thickness @xcite .",
    "this suggests to write  @xcite @xmath13 where the prefactor @xmath14 guarantees that the total interfacial free energy @xmath15 in eq .",

    "minimization of the total excess free energy in eq .",
    "( [ gw ] ) with respect to @xmath2 , with @xmath1 defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : contactpotential ] ) , predicts that , for @xmath17 , the liquid layer width vanishes for temperatures less than a `` bridging temperature '' @xmath18 , defined by @xmath19 , and increases smoothly as @xmath20 ultimately diverging as the melting temperature @xmath21 is approached from below . for @xmath22 , in contrast ,",
    "boundaries remain completely dry ( @xmath23 ) for all @xmath24 up to a maximum temperature @xmath25 defined by @xmath26 and are in metastable equilibrium with respect to the liquid in the superheated range @xmath27 .",
    "the grain - boundary energy is generally defined as the total excess free energy of the boundary with respect to the solid , or @xmath28 here .",
    "therefore , in the wetting case ( @xmath17 ) , this energy is constant and simply equal to @xmath29 for @xmath30 , consistent with the requirement that @xmath31 , but decreases for @xmath32 until reaching @xmath10 at the melting point where @xmath2 diverges . substituting eq .",
    "( [ wet ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ gw ] ) gives @xmath33,\\label{gben}\\ ] ] for @xmath34 , which has limits @xmath35 and zero at @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "in contrast , for non - wetting conditions ( @xmath22 ) , this theory predicts that the grain - boundary energy retains its dry value for all temperatures : @xmath38 for @xmath39 .",
    "phase - field theories of interfacial premelting @xcite where solid - liquid interfaces are inherently spatially diffuse have yielded predictions that are in part consistent with the above picture , but also point to the possibility of more complex premelting behaviors .",
    "the most detailed studies have been carried out in models where the crystal orientation is represented by a scalar field coupled to the standard scalar phase field that measures the local crystal disorder . for wetting conditions ,",
    "those models predict either a smooth increase of @xmath2 with temperature below @xmath21 , qualitatively similar to the behavior predicted by eq .",
    "( [ wet ] ) , or the existence of first - order transitions between grain - boundary states of different widths  @xcite , in analogy with the theory of critical - point wetting  @xcite .",
    "these predictions , however , depend generally on the choice of phenomenological thermodynamic functions and parameters in those models that can not be derived directly from microscopic physics , and thus are hard to relate to real systems . the phase - field crystal model , in contrast , has the advantage of removing much of the arbitrariness inherent in conventional phase - field theories .",
    "it explicitly describes the dislocation structure of grain boundaries and is formulated in terms of physical quantities , such as the liquid structure factor , that can be either measured experimentally or computed using md simulations .",
    "hence , this model can in principle make quantitative predictions that can be compared to both experiments or md simulations as demonstrated recently for isolated solid - liquid interfaces in a bcc system @xcite .      before summarizing our main results , some thermodynamic considerations relevant for the present phase - field crystal study are worthy of brief mention .",
    "first , while premelting for pure materials has traditionally been discussed in the gibbs ensemble of eq .",
    "( [ gw ] ) with constant @xmath24 , pressure @xmath40 , and particle number @xmath41 , the choice of the grand canonical ensemble with constant @xmath24 , chemical potential @xmath42 , and volume @xmath43 , is more suited for the pfc model where the helmholtz free energy is a function of the density and simulations are carried out at fixed @xmath43 .",
    "thus , the disjoining potential is defined here in terms of the excess of the grand potential in complete analogy with eq .",
    "( [ gw ] ) , i.e. it represents the total interfacial contribution of this excess minus its asymptotic value for well - separated interfaces equal to @xmath10 . for reasons detailed below ,",
    "it is simpler to study premelting as a function of @xmath42 rather than @xmath24 in the pfc model .",
    "both are intensive variables , and the results are expected to be equivalent . in particular , the departure of the chemical potential from its equilibrium value @xmath44 in the grand canonical ensemble is analogous to the departure of the temperature from the melting point @xmath45 in the gibbs ensemble , with the solid ( liquid ) being stable for negative ( positive ) values of both quantities in their respective ensembles . for convenience , even though we work in the grand canonical ensemble with @xmath42 as control parameter , we often refer interchangeably hereafter to temperature and chemical potential to facilitate the comparison of our results to previous theories and experiments .",
    "second , we define the liquid layer width using a gibbs construction .",
    "we first determine the excess mass carried by the grain boundary , which is simply the total mass of the bicrystal system with a grain boundary at fixed @xmath42 minus the mass of a single crystal occupying the same volume at the same @xmath42 . the film thickness @xmath2 is then defined by equating this excess mass to the product of @xmath2 and the difference between solid and liquid densities .",
    "the advantage of this thermodynamic approach is that it gives a precise definition of @xmath2 that remains applicable even when the liquid layer is not spatially uniform along the grain boundary , as is the case here for small misorientations .",
    "this definition of course reduces to the standard definition of the layer width in the limit where the liquid layer width is much larger than the intrinsic solid - liquid interface width ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "let us now summarize our main results as they relate to the theories reviewed above .",
    "the structure and properties of symmetric tilt boundaries were studied as a function of misorientation @xmath0 for two different inclinations where the symmetry axis ( from which each crystal is rotated by @xmath47 ) is parallel ( @xmath48 ) or at a 30@xmath49 angle ( @xmath50 ) to any of the six equivalent close - packed directions of the hexagonal crystal .",
    "we find that high - angle boundaries behave essentially as predicted by the sharp - interface theory .",
    "they are dry well below the melting point and become uniformly wetted with a liquid layer of roughly constant width along the boundary .",
    "the latter diverges logarithmically as the melting point is approached from below , consistent with a disjoining potential that is reasonably well approximated by the simple exponential form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : contactpotential ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the behavior of low - angle boundaries in the pfc model is not correctly predicted by the sharp - interface theory , both qualitatively and quantitatively .",
    "the main qualitative difference is that grain boundaries in the pfc model do not remain dry with zero width as predicted by this theory .",
    "they exhibit local melting around dislocations , as previously seen in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the resulting liquid pools cause @xmath2 to increase smoothly with temperature ( i.e. , @xmath51 in the grand canonical phase - field crystal simulations ) , although @xmath2 remains finite at the melting point and into the superheated range ( @xmath52 ) where these boundaries are metastable . at a more quantitative level",
    ", dislocation - induced premelting contributes to the reduction in the grain - boundary energy from its low - temperature value , which can be larger than @xmath10 even for small misorientations , to a value less than @xmath10 near the melting point .",
    "the other factor contributing to this reduction is the elastic softening of the material at the melting point discussed below .",
    "dislocation - induced premelting of low - angle boundaries is reflected in the @xmath2-dependence of the disjoining potential @xmath1 that exhibits a minimum at a finite width @xmath53 , which corresponds to the equilibrium layer width at the melting point .",
    "therefore , this potential is repulsive for @xmath54 and attractive for @xmath55 .",
    "in contrast , it is predicted to be attractive for all @xmath2 in the sharp - interface theory .",
    "the high- and low - angle regimes can be formally distinguished by defining a critical misorientation @xmath4 such that , for @xmath56 , the disjoining potential is purely repulsive for all @xmath2 , and , for @xmath5 , exhibits a minimum with short - range repulsion and long - range attraction .",
    "our results suggest that the transition between these two regimes is smooth , with the equilibrium layer width at the melting point diverging in the limit where @xmath0 approaches @xmath4 from below , although the nature of this divergence is hard to pinpoint precisely .",
    "it should be emphasized that the transition does not correspond to a sharp transition in the geometry of the grain boundary .",
    "rather , the critical angle falls into a range where the geometry of the grain boundary is somewhere in between the two extremes described above .",
    "namely , when the melting point is approached from below for @xmath0 slightly above or below @xmath4 , the grain boundary consists of liquid pools separated by `` bridges '' , but the distance between the dislocations is comparable to the pool diameter , so that the pools start to overlap and the material of the bridges is no longer fully solid .",
    "while the main results described so far are ostensibly independent of inclination , we find some additional @xmath57-dependent features that require refinement of the above picture . for the @xmath50 inclination , which has the simplest behavior ,",
    "the liquid pools were always found to be centered around isolated dislocations for low - angle boundaries , as seen qualitatively in ref .",
    "@xcite , and to merge progressively to form a uniform film with increasing misorientation .",
    "in contrast , for the @xmath48 inclination , which was investigated here in greater detail , discontinuous structural transitions were seen between different grain - boundary states . in one state ,",
    "each dislocation is surrounded by its own liquid pool . in the other state",
    ", two dislocations combine to share a common liquid pool .",
    "the structural transition between these two states only occurs above a small misorientation well below @xmath4 .",
    "the transition first occurs in the overheated states above the melting point , and shifts to lower values of @xmath44 with increasing misorientation .",
    "furthermore , the transition is hysteretic , such that two grain - boundary states with different liquid - pool structures can coexist over a certain range of @xmath42 .",
    "the jump in @xmath2 at the transitions between different states , which measures effectively the change in liquid fraction associated with the pairing of liquid pools , is small .",
    "hence , it can not be ruled out that these transitions would be smeared by fluctuations and not directly observable as sharp transitions in a real system .",
    "the most relevant aspect of our results for experiment is the quantitative prediction of the critical wetting angle @xmath4 above which the liquid layer width diverges at the melting point . in the sharp - interface theory , this angle",
    "is predicted by the standard wetting condition @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is taken to be the completely dry grain - boundary energy far below the melting point . as such",
    ", this condition predicts a value of @xmath4 that is much smaller than observed in the phase - field crystal simulations .",
    "this failure is due to the fact that the sharp - interface theory predicts that the grain - boundary energy is constant for nonwetting conditions .",
    "as noted earlier , this energy is reduced by both dislocation - induced premelting and the elastic softening of the material at high homologous temperature .",
    "therefore , one would expect a better estimate of @xmath4 to be obtained by comparing @xmath10 to a value of the grain - boundary energy at the melting point , @xmath60 , which is generally much lower than @xmath59 as found in a md study of a tilt boundary in pure cu @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath61 when @xmath0 approaches @xmath4 from below , and @xmath62 for all @xmath0 larger than @xmath4 .",
    "of course , the precise determination of @xmath60 generally requires a complete solution of the problem since it depends on the structural details of the premelted grain - boundary structure . a somewhat better prediction of @xmath4 can nonetheless be obtained by an estimation of the grain - boundary energy at the melting point that takes into account the bulk elastic softening of the material and melting around dislocations . as in previous pfc studies",
    "@xcite , we find that for low - angle grain boundaries @xmath7 is well described by the read - shockley law @xcite .",
    "the physical parameters entering this law are the shear modulus @xmath63 and the dislocation core radius @xmath64 .",
    "hence we have , for small angles , @xmath65 .",
    "elastic softening and dislocation premelting are reflected in the temperature dependence of these quantities .",
    "the shear modulus , which can be calculated analytically in the pfc model , has large variations : denoting by @xmath66 and @xmath67 its values at zero temperature and at the melting point , respectively , we find typically @xmath68 .",
    "the variation of the core radius is obtained by fitting our simulation data with the read - shockley law and describes phenomenologically the dislocation premelting .",
    "we observe an increase of the core radius at the melting point by about 40% with respect to its zero - temperature value .",
    "it should be noted that , whereas data for the variation of the elastic constants are readily available , the variation of the core radius is a result of the premelting around dislocations and hence difficult to quantify in experiments or md simulations .",
    "this suggests that it is useful to consider two successive approximations to improve the estimate of the critical wetting angle .",
    "if only the elastic softening is included , we can exploit the fact that in the read - shockley law the grain - boundary energy is simply proportional to the shear modulus .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath69 , and thus the modified wetting condition @xmath70 if , in addition , the variation of the core radius is included , the estimate for the grain - boundary energy becomes @xmath71 , where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the values of the core radius at zero temperature and the melting point , respectively . inserting the explicit expression of the read - shockley law yields the improved wetting condition @xmath74 }                                     { 1-\\ln[2\\pi\\theta_cr_0(0)/(\\alpha a ) ] } \\approx 2\\gamma_{\\mathrm sl},\\label{modwet2}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 is the lattice constant of the hexagonal crystal , and @xmath76 is the distance between close - packed planes in the hexagonal structure , expressed in units of the lattice spacing . concretely , for the @xmath48 inclination , the phase - field crystal simulations yield @xmath77 .",
    "the standard wetting condition @xmath78 predicts a completely erroneous value of @xmath4 of about @xmath79 .",
    "the condition including only the elastic softening predicts @xmath80 , whereas the condition of eq .",
    "( [ modwet2 ] ) including both effects yields @xmath81 . the remaining discrepancy with the value from simulations reflects the fact that the read - shockley law is no longer valid when liquid pools start to overlap and the structure of the grain boundary is no longer well described by an array of isolated dislocations , which is precisely the range where @xmath82 . while , therefore , even the best estimate is still of limited accuracy , it sheds light on several physical effects determining the critical wetting angle that have not been previously appreciated .",
    "finally , the failure of the sharp - interface theory to predict the critical wetting angle obviously makes this theory inadequate in predicting the superheated range of temperature for low - angle boundaries . for @xmath48",
    ", this theory predicts that only boundaries with @xmath0 less than @xmath83 are superheated , while boundaries in the pfc model can be superheated for @xmath0 up to @xmath77 , with this range vanishing as @xmath84 .",
    "if the computed values for the grain - boundary energy at the melting point are used instead of the low - temperature values , the sharp - interface prediction yields the right order of magnitude for the superheated range for angles close to @xmath4 , but largely overestimates this range for low - angle grain boundaries .",

    "the phase diagram of this model has also been discussed previously @xcite . however , since a precise characterization of the bulk phases is important for the present work , we resume here the main steps that are necessary to obtain the properties which are needed in the subsequent developments . to construct the phase diagram , we calculate separately the free - energy density ( free energy per unit surface in two dimensions ) as a function of the mean density @xmath87 in the solid , denoted by @xmath88 , and in the liquid , @xmath89 , using eq .",

    "the equilibrium densities of the two phases as a function of @xmath100 can then be found by the common tangent construction , which is equivalent to the requirement that the chemical potential @xmath42 and the grand potential density @xmath101 must be equal in both phases , @xmath102 @xmath103 the solution of these equations yields the equilibrium densities as a function of temperature , @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "the phase diagram of the pfc model exhibits a critical point . the parameter @xmath100 plays the role of an undercooling , that is , higher @xmath100 correspond to lower temperatures .",
    "furthermore , the phase diagram is symmetric in @xmath87 and hence exhibits two coexistence zones .",
    "we choose for all our simulations negative values of @xmath87 ; for this branch of solutions the solid has a higher density than the liquid .",
    "finally , for values of @xmath87 close to zero , an additional striped ( nematic ) phase can exist , which is not of importance for the present work .",
    "the one - mode ansatz gives a good approximation for the phase diagram as long as @xmath100 remains small .",
    "however , it turns out that this approximation is not sufficient for our purpose since we want to determine _ excess _ free energies due to surfaces , which requires an excellent precision of the bulk values .",
    "therefore , we obtained the function @xmath99 from the numerical solution of the free energy minimization for a periodic hexagonal pattern , and used this function to perform the common tangent construction , which leads to very precise values of @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 .",
    "the solid - liquid interfaces have been studied in detail in the pfc model and in a ginzburg - landau model @xcite .",
    "the main result that is important for the present work is that for @xmath100 small enough , the interfaces are smooth .",
    "that is , the amplitude of the density waves varies from the solid to the liquid over a distance @xmath109 that is much larger than the spacing between density peaks in the solid .",
    "this makes it possible to use a multi - scale expansion and to obtain a good approximation for the surface tension and the order - parameter profile .",
    "however , as for the bulk densities , this approximation is not precise enough for the purpose of the present work . therefore , the surface tension is extracted from the numerical calculations as detailed below .",
    "the interface thickness @xmath109 is obtained from a fit of the density profile @xmath110 ( the density averaged over the @xmath111 direction , which is parallel to the interface ) with a hyperbolic tangent , @xmath112 as shown in fig .  [",

    "a value of @xmath114 is obtained .",
    "the standard equation of motion of the pfc model is  @xcite @xmath115 which reflects the fact that the density field is a locally conserved quantity .",
    "this equation can be efficiently solved by using a semi - implicit pseudospectral formulation , as detailed in appendix a.    however , for the purpose of finding the equilibrium states , this is not an efficient method .",
    "the reason is that the solid and the liquid have different densities , which have to be adjusted to their equilibrium values in the course of the simulation . since eq .",
    "( [ eq : numerics : implementation : eom ] ) implies that mass is transported by diffusion only , the equilibration time scales as the square of the system size . instead",

    "this method is much faster than the others and will be used for almost all of the simulations presented below .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that it is not suitable to simulate isolated solid - liquid interfaces or two - phase states within the coexistence region , since for such states the density @xmath87 is not a unique function of @xmath42 .",
    "such states have therefore to be calculated with fixed total mass .    here",
    "we neglect the effect of thermal fluctuations that is traditionally incorporated in the pfc model through the addition of a langevin noise term in the evolution equation for the density field , with the amplitude of the noise determined by a standard fluctuation - dissipation relation @xcite .",
    "this choice is motivated by the fact that we focus primarily on computing quantitatively the excess interfacial free energies of dry and wet equilibrium grain - boundary states that correspond to stable or metastable free - energy minima .",
    "this requires an accurate computation of the free energy of the system that is readily obtained from a static crystal density field using the `` bare '' free - energy functional defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : energy ] ) , but that is considerably more difficult to obtain when noise is present . in the latter case , the additional entropy generated by the fluctuations of the crystal density field needs to be computed explicitly to obtain a `` renormalized '' free - energy functional , which is needed to compute in a thermodynamically self - consistent way the disjoining potential .",
    "while such a computation is in principle possible ( although it would require long simulations for statistical averaging ) it appears unnecessary for the computation of static equilibrium properties since the bare free - energy functional is derived from a mean - field classical density - functional theory framework that already contains the effect of microscopic fluctuations on the atomic scale . from this fundamental viewpoint , noise in the pfc model",
    "can only be meaningfully defined in the framework of a long - wavelength hydrodynamic theory where it only acts on length scales larger than the correlation length .",
    "pfc simulations with noise in this hydrodynamic limit and without noise should give essentially identical results as far as static equilibrium properties are concerned .",
    "one possible exception is the case where different grain - boundary states ( corresponding to the isolated and paired liquid pool structures already mentioned in sec .",
    "[ subsec : mainresults ] ) are separated by small free - energy barriers .",

    "it is clear that the film thickness @xmath2 plays , for the excess free energy , the same role as the volume in bulk thermodynamics .",
    "furthermore , since at equilibrium the disjoining pressure vanishes , @xmath190 , the variation of the grain - boundary energy is consistent with the fundamental definition of interfacial excess quantities @xcite .",
    "indeed , since @xmath7 is an excess of grand potential , we can write @xmath191 where @xmath192 is the excess free energy ; differentiation with respect to @xmath42 yields @xmath193 as a corollary , once a value of @xmath7 is known for a single value of @xmath42 , the curve @xmath194 can be obtained by integrating the function @xmath195 extracted from the simulations . furthermore , formally the grain - boundary energy can also be obtained by keeping @xmath42 fixed and integrating the `` mechanical work '' @xmath196 over @xmath2 , noticing that the disjoining pressure is non - zero if @xmath197 .",
    "this procedure , however , can not be carried out in practice since the configurations with @xmath198 are not equilibrium states and hence can not be obtained in simulations .",
    "the second remark concerns the generalization of our definition and procedures to other variables and ensembles .",
    "the various relationships between @xmath2 , @xmath1 , and @xmath7 obtained above all make use of the fact that the film thickness has been defined by a gibbs construction using the interface excess of the density , which is the extensive quantity conjugate to the externally controlled intensive variable @xmath42 .",
    "equivalent constructions can of course be performed with other pairs of variables .",
    "for instance , in their lattice - gas study , kikuchi and cahn kept the chemical potential constant and varied the temperature , while they defined the thickness of the liquid layer by the excess of entropy @xcite . similarly , in the @xmath136 ensemble , a film thickness can be defined _ via _ the excess entropy for varying temperature , or _ via _ the excess volume for varying pressure . since , in this ensemble",
    ", the volume is no longer constant , instead of volume densities as above , quantities normalized by the particle number have to be used . nevertheless , following the ideas in ref .",
    "@xcite to treat this change in normalization , all the relations given above can be translated without difficulties .",
    "a more complex situation arises if both the chemical potential and the temperature ( here , @xmath100 ) are allowed to vary . for clarity of exposition",
    ", we use in the remainder of this subsection the temperature @xmath24 instead of the dimensionless quantity @xmath100 .",
    "the definition of the grain - boundary energy and its variation become @xmath199 respectively , where @xmath200 and @xmath201 are the interfacial excesses of the internal energy and the entropy , respectively .",
    "since @xmath7 as well as all the other excess quantities are defined as excesses with respect to a bulk thermodynamic potential that depends on @xmath42 and @xmath24 , they are all state functions , that is , unique functions of the two intensive variables @xmath42 and @xmath24 .",
    "the same is true of the film thickness @xmath2 , which is defined through an interfacial excess quantity .",
    "in contrast , the disjoining potential is _ not _ a state function .",
    "this is easy to see when considering the equilibrium condition for the film thickness , eq .",
    "( [ eq : eqfilmthickness ] ) : its right - hand side , @xmath202 , now depends on the two variables @xmath42 and @xmath24 , which implies that @xmath12 has the same dependency .",
    "if this is to be integrated to a function of a single variable @xmath2 , a direction in the space spanned by @xmath42 and @xmath24 has to be specified .",
    "another way to state the same fact is to remark that in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vggbrelation ] ) , @xmath7 depends on the two independent variables @xmath42 and @xmath24 , whereas the `` reference value '' @xmath10 depends only on one independent variable , since @xmath203 is only defined on the coexistence line in the phase diagram , @xmath204 . for a given point away from this line , where @xmath7 is still defined , @xmath43 can be defined only if a reference point on the coexistence line is specified .",
    "this amounts to specifying the path in the state space that is to be followed . in the developments above ,",
    "we have supposed a particularly simple path , namely , a constant value for one of the variables .",
    "it would be possible to extract from our pfc model disjoining potentials at constant pressure or at constant density : for both cases , the bulk equation of state for the solid ( which can be obtained from @xmath205 ) fixes a relation between @xmath42 and @xmath24 , and @xmath12 can be integrated along this path .",
    "note , however , that this procedure requires the calculation of both the excess mass and the excess entropy .    in summary ,",
    "the definition of the disjoining potential is only meaningful if the corresponding path in thermodynamic state space is specified , and the knowledge of a single disjoining potential yields only a partial knowledge about the premelting transition .",
    "the more general quantity is the grain - boundary energy , which is the thermodynamic potential for the interfacial excess quantities .",
    "if its dependence with respect to the two intensive variables is known , all the possible disjoining potentials can be easily extracted using eq .",
    "( [ eq : vggbrelation ] ) .",
    "having the discussion of sec .",
    "[ subsec : consistency ] in mind , we need to choose a particular path in the state space to investigate the disjoining potential . it would be possible to approach the melting transition from the solid side for a fixed chemical potential by decreasing @xmath100 .",
    "however , extracting the excess entropy is far more delicate than extracting the excess mass . therefore , in the following we prefer to keep @xmath100 fixed to @xmath206 ( a value that has been obtained for the equilibrium solid - liquid interfaces in pure iron with body - centered - cubic crystal ordering @xcite ) and to explore the melting transition by varying the chemical potential @xmath42 .    for the subsequent presentation of the results , we will use the following rescaled variables : @xmath207 this corresponds to a supersaturation .",

    "while this work has yielded a consistent picture of the thermodynamics of premelting in a microscopic model that can hopefully serve as a basis for developing more accurate mesoscopic models , it has also shown that many questions still need to be answered before a truly quantitative description can be obtained .",

    "the order parameters of this theory are the complex amplitudes of crystal density waves in the solid and one would expect the range of interaction of the disjoining potential to be related to the rate of spatial decay of these density waves in the liquid .",
