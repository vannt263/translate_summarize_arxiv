    "population synthesis for binary stars is a convolution of the statistical data on initial parameters and birthrates of binaries with the evolutionary scenarios for them .",
    "the main goals of population synthesis are :    @xmath0 to understand the descent of binaries of different types from unevolved main - sequence binaries which differ only in the masses of components @xmath1 and their separations @xmath2 and to understand the links between the objects of different types ;    @xmath0 to estimate the incidence of binaries of different types and occurrence rates of certain _ events _ in them ( for instance , explosions of novae or supernovae ) ;    @xmath0 to find the distributions of binaries of different types over parameters like masses of components , orbital periods , luminosity of components , spatial velocities ;    @xmath0 to model ` observed' samples of stars applying selection effects .",
    "below , we review the basic principles of population synthesis , discuss the break - up of low and intermediate mass close binaries over different evolutionary scenarios and , as an example , consider results of population synthesis studies for supernovae ia ( snia ) .",
    "we define _ low and intermediate mass binaries as objects in which components end their evolution as white dwarfs_.",
    "the main concept of the population synthesis is that of an `` evolutionary scenario '' , the sequence of transformations of a binary system with given initial @xmath3 ) that it can experience in hubble time ( the term is coined by van den heuvel and heise @xcite ) .    for construction of evolutionary scenarios",
    "all binaries are separated into `` close '' and `` wide '' ones . in close binaries components",
    "interact between themselves , the principal form of interaction is mass exchange through roche lobe overflow . the possibility for interaction of components in a given binary is defined by critical radius @xmath4 , a boundary within which the atmosphere of the evolving star can expand while star remains a distinctly separate object . if @xmath5 , stellar matter starts to flow out .",
    "figure  [ fig : seprad ] sketches zams- and maximum radii of stars and shows descendants of components of binaries depending on their mass and radius at the instant of rlof ( for solar chemical composition stars ) . the upper mass limit for progenitors of he white dwarfs ( wd ) is certain to several tenth of .",
    "the boundary between progenitors of wd and neutron stars ( ns ) is known to about 1  ( it may be different for single stars and components of close binaries ) .",
    "the least certain is the lower cut - off of the masses of progenitors of black holes ( bh ) .",
    "it is expected that between 20 and 50 , components of close binaries may produce ns or bh , depending on such parameters as stellar winds , rotation , and magnetic fields @xcite ; the limit of 40  is sketched in fig .  1 provisionally .",
    "[ fig : seprad ]    the data necessary for construction of evolutionary scenarios is provided by stellar evolution computations .",
    "the main data are : the rates of mass loss through rlof or stellar wind ( sw ) for stars in different evolutionary stages and the nature of the products of evolution ; time scales of evolutionary stages ; initial  final mass relations ; response of stars to accretion ; transformations of separations due to mass exchange / loss and angular momentum loss , especially in the common envelope stages .",
    "evolutionary scenarios for binaries with certain initial parameters may be convolved with star formation rate , binarity rate , distributions of binaries over @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 to get birthrates of stars of different types .",
    "convolved with lifetimes this gives number distribution of stars of different kinds at any epoch of the galactic history , their distributions over basic parameters , and occurrence rates of different events , e. g. , sn . applying selection effects one gets `` observed samples '' of different binaries .",
    "the first numerical population synthesis studies were carried out independently by kornilov and lipunov @xcite for ns , dewey and cordes @xcite for radiopulsars , politano @xcite for cataclysmic variables , lipunov and postnov @xcite for compact magnetized stars .",
    "binarity rate for stars is not known for sure , it was studied for separate groups of stars only .",
    "studies of selection effects for spectroscopic and visual binaries @xcite suggest that binarity rate may be close to 100% .",
    "the studies of spectroscopic and visual binaries @xcite suggest that ( i ) imf for primary components of binaries may be well approximated by power law @xmath9 ; ( ii ) distribution of binaries is flat in @xmath10 .",
    "this allows to estimate that among binaries @xmath11 are close and @xmath12 are low and intermediate mass ones .",
    "the crucial problem that plagues all population synthesis studies is uncertainty about mass and angular momentum loss ( aml ) from the system and especially about _ common envelopes _ ( ce ) .",
    "it is assumed that ce arise when accretor in a close binary is unable to accrete all matter supplied by the donor @xcite .",
    "the usual assumption is that the envelope of the donor engulfs both components ; the latter spiral in , losing energy .",
    "this results in reduction of the separation of components and may end either in the merger of components or in the dissipation of ce .",
    "this is understood qualitatively , but neither analytical theory nor convincing enough computations of the processes inside common envelopes exist .",
    "therefore , usual approach is based on comparison of the energy released in rapprochement of components and binding energy of ce by applying ( most commonly ) an equation @xcite @xmath13 where indexes @xmath14 and @xmath15 refer to initial and final masses and separations , @xmath16 is the mass of accretor , @xmath17 is the efficiency of deposition of energy into common envelope , @xmath18 is a function of stellar radius that , in essence , describes how well donor envelope is bound to the core ( it varies @xmath19 times along rg and agb and depends on the definition of `` core '' boundary and possible release of thermal energy @xcite . if whole ensemble of close binaries is considered and eq .",
    "( [ eq : ce ] ) is applied to any system , irrespective to the evolutionary state of components , satisfactory agreement with observations is usually achieved if @xmath20 .",
    "however , nelemans and co - authors @xcite , for instance , have shown that it is impossible to reconstruct evolution of observed close binary helium wd back to main - sequence binaries if eq .",
    "( [ eq : ce ] ) is applied for the stage of unstable mass transfer between components of comparable mass . instead , it was suggested in @xcite to use for this stage an equation based on the angular momentum ( @xmath21 ) balance : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the amount of matter lost by the system . @xcite",
    "have shown that applying eq .",
    "(  [ eq : dj ] ) with @xmath24 it is possible to explain the origin of all known binary wd and pre - cv . equations ( [ eq : ce ] ) and ( [ eq : dj ] ) give similar results if masses of components strongly differ @xcite .    in the case of super - eddington accretion in the systems with ns or bh accretors formation of common envelopes , perhaps , may be avoided .",
    "the energy of the accreted matter released close to the compact object ( at @xmath25 ) may be sufficient to expel the `` excessive '' matter from the roche - lobe surface around the compact object ( at @xmath26 ) if accretion rate @xmath27 ( see , e. g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is also suggested that common envelopes may be avoided by driving excess of matter by optically - thick winds from the surface of hydrogen - burning accreting white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "note , that the model of radiatively driven winds still lacks elaborated theoretical justification , but it is supported by the presence of outflows in many systems with compact components .    if ce formation is avoided as described above , it is usually _ assumed _ that the matter leaves the system with specific angular momentum of the accreting component .",
    "this _ assumption _ proved to be useful , for instance , for the models of formation of millisecond radiopulsars @xcite or ultracompact low - mass x - ray binaries with wd donors @xcite .",
    "[ fig : close_ce ]        [ fig : rlof ]     the character of mass - exchange in a binary depends on the mass ratio of components and the structure of the envelope of roche - lobe filling star @xcite . for stars with radiative envelopes ,",
    "to the first approximation , mass exchange is stable if @xmath28 ; for @xmath29 it proceeds in the thermal time scale of the donor ; for @xmath30 it proceeds in the dynamical time scale .",
    "mass loss occurs in dynamical time scale if the donor has deep convective envelope . in practice",
    "this means that overwhelming majority ( @xmath31 ) of close binaries pass through one to four stages of common envelope .",
    "a run of population synthesis code ( e. g. , @xcite ) for @xmath32 close binaries with @xmath33 produces @xmath34 different scenarios of evolution . in fig .",
    "[ fig : close_ce ] we present a kind of summary of scenarios for systems that have first unstable rlof . for description ,",
    "we denote evolutionary routes in fig .",
    "[ fig : close_ce ] as `` path * n * '' .    in the tightest systems primaries",
    "overflow roche lobe when they are still in ms .",
    "the least massive of these systems ( @xmath35 ) evolve under the influence of aml via magnetically coupled stellar wind ( msw ) and gravitational waves radiation ( gwr ) .",
    "an outcome of evolution may be formation of a wuma system that merges into rapidly rotating single star .",
    "about 2% of these systems do not finish their evolution in hubble time and remain ms - stars or giants .",
    "majority of merger products end their evolution as wd .",
    "peculiarly , some merger products accumulate mass @xmath36 and explode as snii .    in wider systems donors overflow roche lobes when they have he- or co - cores .",
    "about one third of binaries avoid merger in ce and form pairs consisting of a he- or co / one - wd and a low - mass companion that does not evolve past ms or subgiant stage .",
    "the systems remain wide enough to avoid merger due to aml via gwr and/or msw .",
    "systems that merge in ce typically finish their evolution as wd .",
    "if a binary with a he - core donor does not merge in ce , it first forms a he - star+ms - star pair , that may be observed as an sdb star with ms companion .",
    "when he - star finishes its evolution , a pair harboring a co white dwarf and a ms - star appears .",
    "similar systems are produced by binaries where rlof occurs at agb .",
    "the tightest of the latter systems ( @xmath37 several ) that have low - mass ( @xmath38 ) ms - companions to wd evolve under aml and may form cataclysmic variables . if accreted hydrogen burns at the surface of wd stably , the system may appear as supersoft x - ray source ( sss in the plot ) .",
    "the outcome of the evolution of cv is not completely clear .",
    "the donor may be disrupted when its mass decreases below several hundredth of  @xcite ; accretor may accumulate enough mass to explode as snia ( see below ) ; wd may experience an accretion induced collapse into a ns and a low - mass x - ray binary may be formed .",
    "actually , for a considerable fraction of cv evolution is , most probably , frozen when @xmath39 becomes low .",
    "the second common envelope may form when ms - companion to wd overfills its roche - lobe .",
    "if the donor has a he - core and system does not merge , an sdb+wd system may emerge . if separation of components is sufficiently small , aml via gwr may bring he - star into contact while he is still burning in its core . if @xmath40 stable mass exchange is possible with typical @xmath41@xcite .",
    "it was suggested that accretion of he onto co wd at such @xmath42 leads to sn , when accreted he - layer detonates and initiates detonation of c ( edge - lit detonation @xcite ) .",
    "however , it seems more likely that the lifting effect of rotation reduces the power of he - ignition and a he - nova is produced instead @xcite .",
    "if the system survives sn or nova explosion , an am cvn - type system may be formed .",
    "some 12% of close binaries merge in the second ce and form single wd",
    ". this may create certain excess of massive wd .",
    "if the system avoids merger , a pair of wd is formed .",
    "the closest of them may be brought into contact by aml via gwr .",
    "if in a co+he white dwarf pair conditions for stable mass exchange are fulfilled , an am cvn system forms , see for details @xcite . about 5% of close binary wd merge ; it is not yet clear how the merger proceeds and it is possible that for he+he or co+he pairs a helium star is an intermediate stage @xcite .    a fraction of close binaries produces merging co wd pairs ( `` double - degenerates , dd '' ) with total mass greater than chandrasekhar mass that may explode as snia @xcite .",
    "they are probably the most promising candidates for snia ( see below ) .",
    "figure [ fig : rlof ] shows typical evolutionary scenarios for the systems that stably exchange mass in the first rlof .",
    "it applies to @xmath43 of all close binaries . in the first rlof binaries",
    "may be identified with algol - type systems .",
    "algol phase ends by formation of wd+ms - star system directly or with an interfering phase of he - star+ms - star ( similarly to in fig .",
    "[ fig : close_ce ] ) . in rare cases",
    "wd+ms remain `` frozen '' in this state .",
    "rlof by the former secondary usually results in ce , since @xmath44 .",
    "if the system did not merge in ce , the donor had a nondegenerate he - core and system is close enough , a semidetached wd+he - star system may arise due to the aml via gwr and in such a system a sn or he - nova may explode . in this case",
    "formation of an am cvn star also is possible , like in in fig .",
    "[ fig : close_ce ] . for the systems that avoid merger in ce",
    "the following outcomes of evolution become possible : formation of a non - merging in a hubble time pair of wd ; formation of a dd that merges due to aml via gwr and possibly produces snia or a massive wd .",
    "merger in ce also produces a massive wd .    a special case of evolution , that involves binaries with both low / intermediate and high mass components , leads to formation of recycled pulsars .",
    "first , in the system with initial @xmath45 the primary becomes a ns .",
    "if the system is not disrupted by sn explosion , low - mass secondary after a stage of stable rlof ( when the system is a low - mass x - ray source ) becomes a he wd . in another scenario @xmath46 is larger and , before forming a wd companion to ns , the system passes through ce . in both cases ns",
    "are recycled by accretion .",
    "another peculiar example of evolution involves binaries with @xmath47 and mass of components @xmath48 .",
    "if the first mass exchange is stable , initially less massive component accumulates enough mass to explode as sn ii . in this case massive white dwarf ( former primary ) gets a young neutron star companion ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "[ fig : snflow ]     figure [ fig : snflow ] summarizes the main evolutionary scenarios that are currently considered to result in formation of candidate snia systems . for completeness",
    ", the channel of symbiotic stars is shown , though , they are not `` close binaries '' strictly . a detailed review of the evolution to snia is recently published in @xcite . here",
    "we give a brief outline .",
    "dd - merger scenario ( * a * ) operates both in young ( @xmath49yr and old ( @xmath50yr populations @xcite and may provide for our galaxy the rate of snia ( ) comparable to the one inferred from observations @xcite : @xmath51 .",
    "the dd - scenario recently got strong support both from the theory and observations .",
    "population synthesis @xcite predicted that it may be necessary to study up to @xmath52 field wd with @xmath53 for finding a proper merger candidate .",
    "this was done within spy - project and resulted in discovery of the first super - chandrasekhar dd [ @xmath54 that will merge in 4 gyr and two dd with mass close to   that will merge in one to two hubble times @xcite .",
    "this means that formation of dd candidate snia is quite possible . on the `` theoretical '' side , sph calculations of dd - mergers with account for nuclear burning @xcite",
    "have shown that in the core - disc structure that forms , in the region of interaction the temperature rises rapidly , lifts degeneracy , expands the matter and thus quenches thermonuclear flash .",
    "flame does not propagate to the center , contrary to previously expected ( e. g. , @xcite ) .",
    "stable accretion from the disk is possible . on the other hand ,",
    "deposition of the angular momentum into the core spins - up rotation of wd , causes deformation of wd and aml by distorted configuration via gwr and finally makes possible close - to - center explosive ignition of carbon @xcite .",
    "scenario * b * operates both in young and old populations , but gives a minor contribution to   since typical total masses of the systems are well below .",
    "`` single - degenerate '' ( sd ) scenario ( * c * ) is often considered as the most promising one .",
    "population synthesis estimates lend to it from @xmath43 @xcite to @xmath55 @xcite of the observed .",
    "the uncertainty in the estimates of  from this channel stems from still poorly constrained efficiency of mass accumulation in the process of accretion that is accompanied by hydrogen and helium burning flashes @xcite .",
    "the estimates become more favorable if mass transfer may be stabilized by mass and momentum loss from the system .",
    "`` observational '' problem with this scenario is the absence of hydrogen in the spectra of snia , while it is expected that @xmath56  of h - rich matter may be stripped from the companion by the sn shell @xcite .",
    "recently discovered snia 2001ic and similar 1997cy with signatures of h in the spectra @xcite may belong to the so - called sn1.5 type or occur in symbiotic systems @xcite .",
    "also , under favorable for this scenario conditions , it seems to overproduce supersoft x - ray sources @xcite .",
    "however , sd - scenario got recently support from discovery of a possible companion to tycho sn @xcite .",
    "scenario * d * may operate in populations where star formation have ceased no more than @xmath57gyr ago and produce sn - scale events at the rates that are comparable with the inferred galactic snia rate . but `` by construction '' of the model , the most rapidly moving products of explosions have to be he and ni ; this is not observed .",
    "the spectra produced by eld are not compatible with observations of the overwhelming majority of snia @xcite . on the theoretical side ,",
    "it is possible that lifting effect of rotation that reduces effective gravity and degeneracy in the helium layer may prevent detonation @xcite .",
    "scenario * e * is the only way to produce snia in a wide system , via accumulation of a he layer for eld or of  by accretion of stellar wind matter in a symbiotic binary @xcite .",
    "however , its efficiency is probably low ( @xmath58 ) , because of typically low mass of wd and low @xmath39 in symbiotic systems @xcite .",
    "for the conclusion , let us note that , despite evolution of close binary stars is , at least qualitatively , understood and for certain systems population synthesis provides even quantitative agreement with observations , there are some important problems to solve :"
