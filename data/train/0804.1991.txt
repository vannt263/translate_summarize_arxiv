    "the realization of two - component bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) of trapped alkali atomic clouds @xcite has stimulated the great interest in the multi - component atomic ( or spinor ) gases .",
    "the competition between inter - species and intra - species interactions gives rise to a richer structure of spinor condensates than their single component counterparts .",
    "many theoretical investigations have focused on its stability , phase separation , collective excitation , dynamics and other macroscopic quantum phenomena @xcite .",
    "moreover resonant control of two - body interactions via feshbach resonances in ultracold gases makes it possible to study a two - component condensate with a tunable interspecies interaction . on the other hand ,",
    "the experimental progress in the creation and manipulation of ultracold atomic gases in effective one - dimensional ( 1d ) waveguides @xcite offers the opportunity of studying the many - body physics of the 1d correlated quantum gases even in the strong interaction limit .",
    "the experimental realization of tonks - girardeau ( tg ) gases @xcite in the strongly interacting limit of bose gases has been reported in two recent experiments @xcite .",
    "for the 1d quantum gases @xcite , quantum fluctuations are greatly enhanced and the effects of strong correlations become very important @xcite .",
    "although two - component quantum gases have been the subject of intensive theoretical interest @xcite , most of the studies were carried out within the scheme of the mean field theory which are proven insufficient for strong interactions between particles .",
    "for the system in the strong interaction regime , non - perturbation theory has to be exerted .",
    "for the 1d homogeneous system with @xmath0-function interaction , the two - component bose gas with spin - independent s - wave scattering ( equal interspecies and intra - species interacting strength ) is known to be exactly solvable by the bethe - ansatz method in the full physical regime @xcite .",
    "the exact results have unveiled that ferromagnetic order emerges in spinor bose gases with spin - independent interaction @xcite .",
    "but for the atomic gases with arbitrary interacting strength ( with the su(2 ) symmetry broken ) or in an inhomogeneous trap , the system is no longer integrable .    despite no exact solution for the many - body systems with arbitrary interacting strength in a harmonic trap available ,",
    "it is still possible to resort to numerical exact diagonalization method to obtain the exact solution for small size system .",
    "most recently , some sophistical theoretical methods , such as the exact diagonalization method @xcite and multi - orbital self - consistent hartree method @xcite have been applied to study the single - component few - boson systems in a harmonic trap . due to properly accounting the many - body effects , such methods work well even in strongly interacting regime and yield consistent results with the exact results obtained by the bethe - ansatz method @xcite . in this work , we shall study two - component boson systems with repulsive interactions and focus on few - atom systems which can be treated exactly by exact diagonalization method .",
    "one of the purpose of the present work is to address the role of the correlation in the trapped interacting two - component system under a well controllable way , in particular in the strongly interacting limit where the approximate mean - field methods are generally not able to give correct results .",
    "our study can display the transition from a weakly interacting condensate to the strongly interacting limit in which the strongly repulsive interactions between atoms plays a role of effective pauli principle . in this limit",

    "our goal is to investigate the ground states of the interacting system for all relevant interaction strengths in a numerically exact way which however restricts our study to small particle system .",
    "we note that either the effort to extend the exact diagonalization method to solve the larger system or to get a well controllable numerical result in the strongly interacting limit is a highly challenging and time - consuming task as what have been displayed in the works for the single - component model @xcite .",
