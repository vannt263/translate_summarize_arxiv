    "additional uncertainty in testing traditional isotropic weak coupling bcs value of @xmath73 in fe@xmath0(te@xmath1s@xmath2)@xmath3 is introduced by the percolative nature of superconductivity with up to 7 % superconducting volume fraction ( fig .",

    "it is absent for fe@xmath82te and fe@xmath81te@xcite@xmath41@xcite , visible for fe@xmath83te and rather pronounced for fe@xmath9te with similar entropy under both transitions ( fig 3a , b ) .",
    "magnetic measurements ( @xmath84 ) closely match thermodynamic data ( fig.3 , fig.4 ) .",
    "whereas temperature of lower temperature transition t@xmath39 ( 59 k ) does not change with change in @xmath20 , fe@xmath0te with higher content of excess fe @xmath20 has transition t@xmath8 at higher temperature ( 70 k and 66 k , table i ) .",
    "the fermi level in fe@xmath0te lies exactly at the sharp peak of  the excess fe density of states n(e@xmath85 ) ; therefore higher t@xmath8 may be magnetically driven based on the stoner criterion n(e@xmath85)i > 1.@xcite increased @xmath42 values for fe@xmath9te when compared to fe@xmath83te are also consistent with this ( fig .",
    "2 ) . higher level of excess fe @xmath20 corresponds to larger size mismatch between cylindrical electron and hole fermi surfaces .",
    "therefore t@xmath39 and t@xmath8 transitions may correspond to successive sdw fermi surface nesting of individual electron - hole cylindrical pieces.subedi@xmath41@xcite recent work shows that the magnetic order in parent compounds of iron based superconductors is established below temperature of structural transition with up to 20 k difference in temperature of transition , as seen in cefe@xmath1co@xmath2asf .@xcite@xmath41@xcite it is unlikely that two transitions seen in our crystals correspond to individual magnetic and structural transitions since they have the same sensitivity to magnetic field .",

    "zero resistivity in fully percolating path was observed for @xmath88 .",
    "the superconducting transition width decreases with the increase of @xmath19 and @xmath6 . clearly , there is a competition between magnetic sdw order and the superconducting state since with increase in sulfur content @xmath19 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 have opposite signs .",
    "having delineated the evolution of magnetic and superconducting properties , it is natural to ask what is the correlation with the structural parameters .",

    "the angle @xmath92 increases up to @xmath43 and then decreases with further sulfur increase .",
