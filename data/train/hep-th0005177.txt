    "the measurement of non - commuting operators in a quantum system is at the root of the well - known paradoxes of quantum mechanics .",
    "for example , the kochen - specker paradox involves measurement of a set of non - commuting operators with mutually commuting subsets @xcite .",
    "the bell inequalities are similarly formulated by incompatible space - like separated spin measurements @xcite .",
    "the connection of these problems to quantum non - locality motivates the consideration of an alternative definition for the measurement of incompatible quantum observables . because measured quantities are inherently statistical , quantum mechanics requires an ensemble of identical systems to establish an expectation value .",
    "the types of measurements on the ensemble in the situation of non - commuting observables is critical to the interpretation of the result . for example , the usual simultaneous measurement of position and momentum would require separate measurements of each operator on half the ensemble at the same time .",
    "this procedure for the assignment of position and momentum to a system , coupled with wavefunction collapse , leads to a built - in non - locality in system observables .",
    "one approach to this problem is to restrict _ valid _ measurement of non - commuting observables to be with special - purpose ancillary quantum systems ( referred to as vacuum meters in this paper ) that are entangled with the original system . in the alternative _ entangled simultaneous _",
    "measurement scheme , all systems in the ensemble have the same experimental set - up with coupling to vacuum meters for a joint position / momentum measurement .",
    "the premise of this paper is that this procedure , while avoiding quantum non - locality , yields results that are properly interpreted as a joint measurement of non - commuting observables .",
    "furthermore , it is assumed that , probably due to a principle involving quantum non - locality , entangled states are fundamental to particle representations . the principle mandates that particle states allow the simultaneous determination of all particle observables .",
    "these assumptions impose the structure of a naimark extension on particle multiplets .    allowed quantum numbers and statistics for relativistic particles are strictly constrained by the dual principles of lorentz invariance and quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "the latter requires states that represent symmetries of the lagrangian . a larger structure , the naimark extension of the poincare algebra @xcite , results if states are required for the measurement of incompatible observables with entangled vacuum meters .",
    "new commuting operators are defined in a naimark extension that project to the original set upon meter measurement .",
    "a key component of the measurement scheme is the entanglement of the system with a vacuum state containing independent meters .",
    "the assumption of fermi - dirac statistics for the meters forces a different particle identity ( flavor ) onto the ancillary particles that make up the meters .",
    "it is shown in this paper that the minimum hilbert space for the naimark extension of the poincare algebra contains six independent fermions , which are identified with left- and right - handed lepton / quark generations .",
    "the particle set is the minimum required for realization of the poincare algebra on commuting operators such that particles can entangle with vacuum meters .",
    "the universal nature of fermionic multiplets , existing for both leptons and quarks , motivates the suggestion of a single underlying principle rooted in relativistic quantum mechanics .",

    "non - orthogonal projection operators , such as generated by optical coherent states @xcite , are extended to orthogonal projection operators in a combined system / meter hilbert space @xcite .",
    "as first proposed by von neumann @xcite , and developed by arthurs and kelly @xcite , a realization of the naimark extension for position and momentum is obtained by the entangling of a harmonic oscillator with meter harmonic oscillators in ground states . in the arthurs - kelly model , measurement on two meters results in the collapse of the system wavefunction to a coherent state corresponding to the measured position and momentum .",
    "as explained by levine and tucci @xcite , entangled simultaneous measurement of position and momentum with a single meter results in the collapse of the system to the eigenstate of the operator that was measured on the system .",
    "however , the system / meter expectation values are still proportional to the desired system expectation values .",

    "the mechanism for entangled simultaneous measurement is particularly transparent for second quantized systems .",
    "the vacuum , which is defined as the state projected to zero by annihilation operators , is critical to isolate incompatible system observables on independent meters .",
