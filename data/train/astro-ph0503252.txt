    "in a supernova ( sn ) explosion of a compact star , a shock wave is accelerated to a relativistic speed in the surface layer with a sharp density gradient and results in relativistic motion of the ejecta @xcite .",
    "this kind of sne is observationally classified into type ic ( sne ic ) . from radio observations for one of sne ic ( sn 1998bw ) , @xcite inferred that the radio shock front originated from this sn was moving at relativistic speeds with the lorentz factor between 1.6 and 2 . since the discovery of a close association of a @xmath0-ray burst grb 980425 with this supernova @xcite , there has been accumulated evidence that some of sne ic are related to a class of @xmath1-ray bursts .",
    "@xcite proposed a plausible model ( the fireball shock model ) to describe @xmath0-ray bursts as phenomena taking place at cosmological distances , in which relativistic motion with the lorentz factor of @xmath2 is required to accommodate the observed variability on very short time scales to huge @xmath0-ray intensities and the shock converts its kinetic energy of the baryons into electrons to emit nonthermal @xmath0-ray photons .",
    "other models involving no relativistic motion would lead to a conflict that the size of the source indicated by the observed short time scales are compact enough for @xmath0-ray photons to collide to yield e@xmath3e@xmath4 pairs and emit little @xmath0-rays .",
    "this model predicted _ afterglows _ of @xmath0-ray bursts @xcite .",
    "the first detection of the x - ray afterglow from grb 970228 by the beppo - sax satellite @xcite and the subsequent identification of the host galaxy confirmed the @xmath0-ray burst as an event at a cosmological distance @xcite .",
    "thus it will be important to investigate under what conditions the matter ejected from a sn ic ( or a core collapse sn in general ) give rise to this relativistic motion .",
    "another aspect of the relativistic sn ejecta can be seen in the production of light elements .",
    "recent observations for metal - poor stars have shown that the abundance of be increases proportionally to the abundance of fe , which indicates that primary processes predominantly produce be .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the relativistic motion of ejecta from sne ic may contribute to the production of light elements li , be , and b through spallation reactions as a primary process because the surface layer of the ejecta is composed of c and o. though these studies are based on spherically symmetric models for sne ic , it would be interesting to investigate the effects of an aspherical sn explosion on the acceleration of the ejecta and the production of the light elements . @xcite and @xcite pointed out that an aspherical explosion may enhance the acceleration compared to a spherical explosion with the same explosion energy .",
    "thus an aspherical explosion might produce more light elements .",
    "furthermore , the acceleration strengthened by an aspherical explosion should be realized by a collimation of the flow . the collimated flow or jet",
    "is required to interpret the time evolution of the afterglow of some @xmath0-ray bursts @xcite .",
    "hence the connection between sne and @xmath0-ray bursts needs to be explored in this respect as well . a linear stability analysis of the corresponding spherical or plane - parallel flow will be a good starting point to understand this possible collimation mechanism .    to study the acceleration of matter before and after the passage of a shock wave across the surface of a stratified medium adjacent to a vacuum in general",
    ", we will present a self - similar solution for an ultra - relativistic shock wave propagating in a plane - parallel medium .",
    "this problem without taking into account relativistic effects was posed by @xcite and fully solved by @xcite .",
    "their solutions inevitably involve an infinite velocity at the surface after the shock emergence",
    ". therefore a self - consistent solution needs to take into account relativistic effects . to obtain a relativistic solution",
    ", we follow the procedure of @xcite with a different choice of non - dimensional independent variables . as was done in @xcite for an ultra - relativistic shock wave emanating from a strong point explosion , the lorentz factor of the shock front",
    "is assumed to evolve with time @xmath5 . for our problem ,",
    "the time @xmath6 is assumed to be measured from the moment when the shock front hits the surface and the parameter @xmath7 is to be determined by the condition that the flow extend through a critical point ( see  [ bse ] ) .",
    "a similar work was studied by @xcite to describe the propagation of a relativistic shock wave in an exponential atmosphere .",
    "in this situation , the flow after the shock emergence can not be treated because the surface is located at infinity .",
    "another work related to the present work was done by @xcite .",
    "they derived a solution for free expansion into a vacuum with the initial condition that the fluid is at rest while we will be concerned with a solution for free expansion of the shocked fluid moving into a vacuum .",
    "@xcite also derived a solution for the shock propagation into a medium of decreasing density which starts from two adjacent fluids at rest with different pressures .",
    "they have treated the same problem as in the present paper except for the initial conditions .",
    "thus the solutions will be compared in some detail .",
    "since the assumed density distribution is realized when a polytropic gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium with a constant gravitational acceleration , there will be many situations to which this solution can apply in addition to the surface of a star . the analytical description of the flow presented in this paper will enable us to easily investigate the linear stability of the flow . therefore this study is essential to investigating whether a disturbed shock front will enhance the acceleration of matter and lead to a collimated flow .",
    "furthermore , this study will give a possible physical mechanism of the energy injection to the fireball model .",
    "next section outlines the problem discussed in this paper .",
    "the flow before shock emergence is formulated and its self - similar solution is derived in  [ bse ] .",
    "the subsequent self - similar flow after shock emergence is described in  [ ase ] .",
    "the analytical solution for the flow at extremely large @xmath6 is also presented .",
    "based on these solutions ,  [ energyspectrum ] discusses the energy spectrum of the outermost layer of the ejected matter as a result of the shock breakout into a vacuum . ",
    "[ summary ] concludes the paper .",
    "the appendix gives the analytical description for the self - similar flow before shock emergence .",
    "a self - similar evolution of the flow associated with the ultra - relativistic shock wave in a plane parallel stratified medium and the subsequent flow after the shock emergence is investigated in the following context :    ( a ) : :    the initial density distribution @xmath8 is given by    a power law as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the distance measured from the    surface .",
    "two positive constants @xmath11 and    @xmath12 have been introduced .",
    "note , however , that this    distribution is a good approximation only near the surface of a star    because the gravitational acceleration needs to be assumed constant    and the sphericity is ignored .",
    "we will consider two specific cases in    some detail : a convective envelope expressed with    @xmath13 and radiative one with    @xmath14 , though our solutions presented in this paper    hold for any positive @xmath12 .",
    "the exterior of the star    denoted by negative @xmath10 is assumed to be vacuum before the    shock emergence .",
    "( b ) : :    an ultra - relativistic shock wave propagates toward the surface in a    static medium with the density distribution given above .",
    "the effect of    gravity on the shock wave is assumed to be negligible .",
    "the pressure in    front of the shock wave is neglected .",
    "the time @xmath6 is    measured from the instant of shock arrival at the surface .",
    "thus this    stage before the shock emergence is denoted by negative    @xmath6 .",
    "( c ) : :    after the shock emergence ( @xmath15 ) , the fluid expands into    the vacuum .",
    "the initial conditions for the flow are given by the    solution in the stage ( b ) when the shock hits the surface    ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the analytical expression for the    asymptotic solution with @xmath17 will be shown .",
    "in this section , we derive equations governing the propagation of an ultra - relativistic shock wave and the associated self - similar flow from basic equations of relativistic hydrodynamics and discuss the boundary conditions at the shock front .",
    "next , we define the similarity variable and convert the partial differential equations into a set of ordinary differential equations . the energy and momentum conservation laws in a fixed frame ( @xmath18 ) can be expressed as @xmath19 @xmath20 in a plane parallel atmosphere . here",
    "@xmath21 denotes the lorentz factor , @xmath22 the velocity divided by the speed of light @xmath23 ( we set @xmath24 in the following ) , and @xmath25 denotes the pressure .",
    "the energy density @xmath26 per unit volume includes the thermal energy and the rest mass energy .",
    "the continuity equation is written in terms of the number density @xmath27 in the fixed frame as @xmath28 this density is defined by @xmath29 with the number density @xmath30 in the co - moving frame .",
    "equations ( [ em1])([cont ] ) are to be solved with an equation of state . since we are concerned with the propagation of a shock wave in the relativistic limit , it will be appropriate to use the ultra - relativistic equation of state @xmath31 using the relation between the partial time derivative @xmath32 at a fixed point and the total derivative @xmath33 : @xmath34 , together with this equation of state , equations ( [ em1])([cont ] ) are combined to yield @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37    then the non - dimensional pressure @xmath38 , lorentz factor @xmath39 , and density @xmath40 are introduced as functions of the similarity variable @xmath41 .",
    "they are defined to become unity at the shock front satisfying the ultra - relativistic rankine - hugoniot relations ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as follows , @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the position and the lorentz factor of the shock front and @xmath47 is the mean mass of the constituent particles .",
    "as was mentioned in  1 , the lorentz factor of the shock front @xmath46 is assumed to evolve with the time @xmath6 as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a constant . following @xcite ,",
    "the similarity variable @xmath41 is defined as @xmath50 here the power index @xmath7 must be greater than @xmath51 so that the shock speed not exceed the speed of light . note that when the shock reaches the surface , i.e. @xmath52 , the lorentz factor @xmath46 diverges , i.e. , the shock speed approaches to the speed of light .",
    "the value of @xmath7 can not be determined from the initial conditions , but from the condition that the solution extend across a critical point to infinity .",
    "the boundary conditions at the shock front are expressed as @xmath53    the coordinate system can be transformed from @xmath54 to @xmath55 by the following relations @xmath56",
    "@xmath57 @xmath58 these relations hold to the accuracy of the order of @xmath59 . using these relations and substituting ( [ rhp])-([rhn ] ) into equations ( [ dpdt])-([adiabat ] ) yields the following ordinary differential equations , @xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath62",
    "these equations have been expanded in powers of @xmath63 and @xmath64 and truncated at the first contributions . given values of @xmath65 and @xmath7 , these equations are integrated from @xmath66 to @xmath67 with the boundary conditions ( [ boundary ] ) .",
    "however , it is found that the derivatives diverge at a finite @xmath41 except for a certain value of @xmath7 . to avoid this",
    ", the denominators and numerators on the right hand sides of these equations must vanish simultaneously , which occurs when @xmath68 the shock being accelerated toward the surface indicates a positive @xmath69 .",
    "if the negative value were chosen , the shock lorentz factor would decrease to zero ( less than 1 ) as the shock approaches the surface .",
    "this is not physical and the approximation of the relativistic limit would not hold . hence , equation ( [ dgdx ] ) is reduced to a simpler form , @xmath70 the other two equations are also simplified to equations ( [ asdfdx ] ) and ( [ asdhdx ] ) in the appendix .",
    "it should be noted here that @xcite have also presented an expression for the shock propagation in equation ( 43 ) of their paper , which indicates @xmath71 this relation is derived from an invariant quantity carried by forward characteristics and should hold in general situations .",
    "since the density @xmath30 at the shock front evolves with time @xmath6 as @xmath72 , this expression is precisely equivalent to the shock propagation indicated by the value of @xmath7 in equation ( [ eigenvalue ] ) .      though the analytical form obtained by integrations of ( [ dfdx])([dhdx ] ) is available and presented in the appendix , the dependent variables @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 can be expressed in terms of @xmath73 rather than the independent variable @xmath41 .",
    "thus we numerically integrate equations ( [ dfdx])([dhdx ] ) to obtain the distributions of the pressure , density , and lorentz factor as functions of @xmath41 .",
    "the results are shown in figure 1 for @xmath74 and figure 2 for @xmath75 .",
    "this expression is more convenient for investigating the distribution and time evolution of the flow .    here",
    "we will make a comparison of this solution with that presented by @xcite . they have derived a relation between the lorentz factors @xmath0 and",
    "the positions @xmath10 of a fluid element at two different moments after passing through the ultra - relativistic shock front propagating in the medium with the density distribution given by equation ( [ density ] ) , @xmath76 here @xmath77 and @xmath78 denote the values at the moment when the fluid element is hit by the shock wave .",
    "note that the original form in @xcite is slightly different from the above expression because our coordinate @xmath10 is different from theirs .",
    "we have confirmed that this relation can be deduced from our solution by the following procedure . in the relativistic limit ,",
    "the distance @xmath10 from the surface is simply proportional to time @xmath6 .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath79 here the time @xmath6 has been converted into the shock lorentz factor @xmath46 using equation ( [ lorentz ] ) .",
    "then the adiabatic evolution of the fluid element after passing the shock front yields a relation between the non - dimensional functions and the lorentz factors , @xmath80 eliminating @xmath39 , @xmath38 , @xmath40 from this equation and equations ( [ truef])([trueh ] ) in the appendix , @xmath73 can be expressed as a function of the ratio of the lorentz factors @xmath81 . substituting this expression into @xmath82 in equation ( [ trueg ] ) ,",
    "then @xmath39 is expressed as @xmath83 eliminating @xmath39 from equations ( [ position ] ) and ( [ ggamma ] ) yields the relation ( [ jmrelation ] ) .",
    "thus the assumption of self - similarity does not lose any generality .",
    "the above relation ( [ jmrelation ] ) can yield the ratio of the lorentz factors @xmath84 of a fluid element when it passes the original surface by setting @xmath85 . at this moment",
    ", the shock is already emerging from the surface . on the other hand ,",
    "the self - similar solution presented in this section holds as long as the shock exists . to describe the flow after the shock disappears as it hits the surface , an extended solution is developed in the following sections .      in order to extend the solution obtained in the previous section to describe the flow after the shock emergence , the limiting behavior of the fluid when @xmath52 needs to be described . from equation ( [ chi ] ) , the position of the shock front is given by the formula @xmath86 hence @xmath87 as @xmath52 .",
    "thus the behavior of @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 defined by ( [ rhp])([rhn ] ) is determined by the condition that @xmath25 , @xmath0 , and @xmath27 must not vanish or diverge at all places with finite @xmath41 s . to satisfy this condition",
    ", we need to eliminate their dependences on @xmath6 to yield @xmath88 @xmath89 @xmath90 where the subscript 1 indicates the limiting functions . in the appendix ,",
    "this argument is verified in the analytical form . as a result ,",
    "their distributions at the instant of the shock emergence are given by @xmath91^ { \\frac { 2\\delta}{2+\\sqrt 3(1+\\delta)}}x^ { \\frac { 2\\delta}{2+\\sqrt 3(1+\\delta ) } } , \\ ] ] @xmath92a}\\right\\}^\\frac{\\sqrt 3\\delta}{2+\\sqrt 3(1+\\delta ) } x^{- \\frac{\\sqrt 3\\delta}{2+\\sqrt 3(1+\\delta ) } } , \\ ] ] @xmath93^\\frac { 2\\delta}{2+\\sqrt 3(1+\\delta ) } x^ { \\frac { 2\\delta}{2+\\sqrt 3(1+\\delta ) } } .\\ ] ] here the subscript 1 indicates distributions at @xmath94 .",
    "the distribution of the density has a clearly different power law index from that in the initial condition .",
    "this is a purely relativistic effect , since it does not happen in non - relativistic case @xcite , in which the strong shock always compresses the fluid by a constant factor .",
    "since no new scale is introduced after the shock emergence , the fluid keeps its self - similarity ( in newtonian case , see * ? ? ?",
    "lagrangian coordinates are convenient for describing the motion of the expanding gas into a vacuum starting from given initial distributions @xcite .",
    "thus we will use a lagrangian coordinate @xmath95 defined as it coincides with the eulerian coordinate @xmath10 at @xmath94 in the previous section .",

    "unlike the flow before shock emergence , the solution does not have a critical point .",
    "the results for @xmath115 and 1.5 are shown in figures 3 and 4 .",
    "there are two invariants in this solution .",
    "one is from the adiabatic condition ( eq . ( [ dhdeta ] ) ) , @xmath116 and the other is @xmath117 obtained by eliminating @xmath118 from equations ( [ dgdeta ] ) and ( [ dfdeta ] ) .",
    "this is the riemann invariant whose precise form in the relativistic limit is given in @xcite . from equations ( [ dgdeta])-([drdeta ] ) , we can derive the asymptotic solution in the limit of @xmath119 undergoing power law evolution : @xmath120 substituting them into equations ( [ dgdeta])-([dhdeta ] ) , it follows that the power law indices must satisfy the following relations @xmath121",
    "@xmath122 @xmath123 @xmath124 where @xmath125 .",
    "these equations have two solutions one of which is independent of @xmath12 or @xmath7 except for @xmath126 .",
    "the other solution gives a negative @xmath127 which is unphysical .",
    "thus the time scale of the asymptotic behavior does not depend upon the initial conditions because the leading edge of the fluid expands as fast as the speed of light . as a result",
    ", we obtain @xmath128 @xmath129 using these power law indices , the non - dimensional position @xmath130 is found to evolve as @xmath131 from equation ( [ drdeta ] ) .",
    "we have confirmed that these are exactly matched with the results of the numerical integration .",
    "furthermore , we can express the coefficients @xmath132 and @xmath133 in terms of @xmath12 using equations ( [ inv1 ] ) and ( [ inv2 ] ) together with the expression for @xmath126 in ( [ afindex ] ) as @xmath134 these values also agree with our numerical results .",
    "all the coefficients depend on @xmath12 and remember the initial density distribution .",
    "our results are similar to those of @xcite in some sense , though their initial conditions are different from ours .",
    "for example , it follows from our results that @xmath135 , where the subscript @xmath38 denotes the final value . on the other hand , @xcite show @xmath136 .",
    "their fluid is initially static and uniform while ours is already not uniform and expanding at this initial moment , though both treat a fluid expanding into a vacuum . due to their initial conditions ,",
    "their problem inevitably involves non - relativistic flow in which the riemann invariant obtained above in the relativistic limit is not appropriate .",
    "this causes the difference in the factor of 4 in front of @xmath137 .",
    "our approach can be applied to any small value of @xmath12 as long as it is positive , because the shock front is eventually accelerated to ultra - relativistic speeds .",
    "it is , however , not appropriate for @xmath138 , a special case of which is treated by @xcite .",

    "the distributions of our self - similar solution converge to power law distributions in this limit , which is referred to _",
    "the asymptotic distribution _ here .",
    "this distribution is still intermediate and eventually changes to non - self - similar distribution when the matter cools down and no longer behaves as ultra - relativistic gas .",
    "of course , a real star is spherical thus sphericity should be taken into account when we consider the motion far from the stellar surface .",
    "the effects of sphericity will be incorporated by expanding the flow variables in the power series of the ratio of the distance from the surface to the stellar radius @xcite or by introducing an empirical formula obtained from comparisons with numerical calculations for spherically symmetric explosions @xcite .    when @xmath141 , i.e. @xmath119 , the asymptotic distributions of @xmath142 and @xmath143 have been already obtained in ( [ afindex ] ) and ( [ afcoeff ] ) .",

    "however , the distributions significantly change after the shock emergence . according to sakurai s solutions for a gas with the adiabatic index 4/3 @xcite , the distributions of pressure and density in the limit of @xmath141 are @xmath149 @xmath150 these power law indices are quite different from those at the instant of shock emergence ( @xmath94 ) , details of the indices are shown in table 1 .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of @xmath151 suggests that the lorentz factor continues to increase without bound as long as the ultra - relativistic equation of state ( [ eos ] ) holds .",
    "the adiabatic expansion will eventually invalidate this equation of state and cease a further acceleration .",
    "this effect will be taken into account to obtain the energy spectrum of the ejecta in the next section .",
    "from the self - similar solution discussed in the preceding sections , the energy spectrum in the ejected matter near the leading edge and its dependence on the initial strength of the explosion will be derived in this section .",
    "the initial strength of the explosion is deduced from the coefficient @xmath49 in equation ( [ lorentz ] ) .",
    "it is expected that @xmath49 is proportional to the square of the explosion energy per unit mass , though both of the total energy and ejected mass involved in this self - similar solution are infinite .",
    "the energy per unit mass excluding the rest mass energy is given by @xmath152 where @xmath153 here we have used the ultra - relativistic equation of state ( [ eos ] ) .    the energy spectrum is defined as the total mass with the energy per unit mass greater than @xmath154 , @xmath155 where @xmath156 denotes the lagrangian coordinate of the fluid element with the energy per unit mass of @xmath154 .",
    "substituting ( [ plim])-([nlim ] ) ( for @xmath94 ) or ( [ pasympt])-([nasympt ] ) ( for @xmath17 ) into ( [ especific ] ) and taking the dominant term at a specific time , we can evaluate the relation between @xmath95 and @xmath154 .",

    ", we obtain the energy spectrum with exactly the same dependence on @xmath166 and @xmath154 as at @xmath94 .",
    "this solution shows that the energy in the outermost layer of the ejected matter is dominated by the kinetic energy at both @xmath94 and @xmath176 and that the velocity profile in this region converges to one with the same power law index in both of these two limits .",
    "therefore , it shows the final energy spectrum of the ejected matter with the same dependence on @xmath166 and @xmath154 as at @xmath94 .",
    "thus @xcite used the relation ( [ sakuraisp ] ) for @xmath115 to derive the empirical formula for the energy spectrum of the ejected matter @xmath177 , where the explosion energy per unit mass is expressed by the ratio of the explosion energy @xmath178 to the ejected mass @xmath179 .",
    "the above energy spectrum ( [ esrelan ] ) as a result of the relativistic shock breakout is still intermediate and the final energy spectrum should be modified from it to that at the moments when the acceleration ceases in each fluid element . assuming that the pressure suddenly drops to zero when @xmath180 reaches 1 @xcite , the lorentz factor @xmath0 at this moment in each fluid element can be obtained as a function of @xmath95 .",

    "the energy spectrum becomes @xmath183 . on the other hand , the non - relativistic treatment yields the energy spectrum @xmath184 for @xmath13 by substituting @xmath185 into the second equation of ( [ sakuraisp ] ) , which coincides with equation ( 24 ) of @xcite .",

    "the asymptotic distributions of the flow as a result of the phenomenon are also presented in the analytical form .",
    "thanks to the detailed comparison with the results of @xcite presented in  [ bsolu ] , one can trace back each fluid element in the final state to the original position . equation ( [ jmrelation ] ) applied to the flow at @xmath94 yields the ratio of the lagrangian coordinate @xmath95 to the original position @xmath78 as @xmath186 these two coordinates are related to each other by the expression for @xmath187 obtained in equation ( [ gamma1 ] ) in terms of the lagrangian coordinate @xmath95 and @xmath188 as indicated by equation ( [ rhg ] ) .",
    "therefore the flow in the final state described in terms of @xmath95 in  [ fsolu ] can be expressed as functions of @xmath78 .",
    "it would be possible to formulate the flow before shock emergence with a lagrangian coordinate as was shown by @xcite for non - relativistic flow .",
    "however , it might not be possible to derive the eigen value of @xmath7 analytically from this formalism because the resultant differential equation corresponding to equation ( [ dgdx ] ) would inevitably involve the self - similar variable for density . furthermore , it is not obvious how to choose an appropriate self - similar coordinate .",
    "the energy spectrum in the ejected matter is deduced from the solution in terms of the mass @xmath189 of the ejected matter with the lorentz factor greater than a certain value .",
    "the power law index of this mass with respect to @xmath49 greater than @xmath190 indicates that the enhancement of the initial explosion energy will accelerate the matter near the leading edge more effectively than that in the inner part of the ejected matter because this relation holds only in the outermost layers of the ejecta .",
    "otherwise , the total energy would not be conserved .",
    "it is also expected from this power law index that if the explosion energy is not distributed uniformly in the lateral direction , the non - uniformity will be enhanced near the leading edge of the ejected matter and result in jets .",
    "this solution will be useful to test relativistic hydrodynamical codes whether they are appropriate to treat the passage of a shock wave across the surface of the matter to a vacuum .",
    "this work has been partially supported by the grant in aid ( 16540213 ) of the ministry of education , science , culture , and sports in japan .",
    "differential equations ( [ dfdx])-([dhdx ] ) can be analytically integrated after some manipulations . using a new independent variable defined as @xmath191 , equations ( [ dfdx])-([dhdx ] ) are transformed into differential equations with respect to @xmath192 , @xmath193 @xmath194 @xmath195 these equations can be integrated to yield @xmath196 @xmath197 @xmath198 where constants have been introduced and are defined as @xmath199 @xmath200 @xmath201 @xmath202 @xmath203 @xmath204 here we have used the initial conditions ( [ boundary ] ) . from ( [ af])-([ah ] ) , we can obtain the behaviors of @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 in the limit of @xmath205 , i.e. , @xmath206 where the constant terms @xmath207 and @xmath208 in these equations are negligible .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath209 which are rewritten in terms of @xmath41 as @xmath210 these results justify our anticipation for the limiting behavior of the solution ( [ fasympt])-([hasympt ] ) .    for the eigenvalue @xmath211",
    "obtained in  [ bse ] , equations ( [ adfdx])([adhdx ] ) are reduced to @xmath212 @xmath213 @xmath214 these can be integrated to the analytical expression for the numerical solution presented in  [ bse ] . by directly substituting the eigenvalue of @xmath7 into equations ( [ af])([ah ] ) , we also obtain the analytical expressions , @xmath215 @xmath216 @xmath217    blandford , r.d . & mckee , c. f. 1976 , phys . fluids , 19 , 1130 colgate , s.  a. , mckee , c.  r. , & blevins , b.  1972 , , 173 , l87 costa , e. , et al .",
