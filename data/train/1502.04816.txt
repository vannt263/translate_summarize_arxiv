    "the determination of asteroid physical properties is an essential part of the complex process of revealing the nature of the asteroid population . in many cases ,",
    "this process starts with obtaining observational data , continues with creating a model of the asteroid ( i.e. , its size , 3-d shape , and spin state , in the first approximation ) , and ends with interpreting new facts based on the model or a set of these . in this sense",

    "results based on individual well - studied asteroids can be generalized to other members of the population . on the other hand ,",

    ", we will build on the content of the _ asteroids iii _",
    "chapter by @xcite about asteroid models reconstructed from _",
    "disk - integrated _ photometry .",
    "although visual photometry still remains the most important data source of the modeling , the main progress in this field since _ asteroids iii _ has been the addition of _ complementary data sources_. many of these data sources are _ disk - resolved _",
    ", thus containing much more information than disk - integrated data .",
    "this shift in paradigm  using photometry not alone but simultaneously with complementary data  was mentioned in the last paragraph of the _ asteroids iii _ chapter as `` _ perhaps the most interesting future prospect _ '' , and we are now at this stage . in the following , we will review all data types suitable for inversion , their sources , uncertainties , and how they can be used in modeling .    when describing the methods of data inversion and the results obtained by these methods , it is also important to emphasize caveats , ambiguities , and possible sources of errors . although the description of what can be obtained from different data sources is exciting , the knowledge of what can not , i.e. , what are limitations of our data sets , is of the same importance .",
    "omitting this may lead to over interpretation of results .",
    "this chapter is structured as follows .",
    "first we review the main principles of the multimodal inverse problem in sect .",
    "[ sec : inversion ] .",
    "then , in sect .  [ sec : data ]",
    ", we discuss each data type and their contribution to model characteristics and details , and we describe some extensions of the predominant model . in sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we discuss the main results based on lightcurve inversion and multimodal asteroid reconstruction .",
    "we conclude with prospects for the future in sect .",
    "[ sec : future ] .",
    "asteroid physical model reconstruction from multimodal data is , by its nature , a mathematical inverse problem .",
    "it is ill - posed ; i.e. , the uniqueness and stability properties of the solution are usually not very good unless the data are supported by a number of prior constraints .",
    "furthermore , it is not sufficient just to fit some model to the data numerically and try to probe the solution space with some scheme .",
    "although there are more approaches to the problem of asteroid shape reconstruction , they are usually dealing with only one data type and we mention them in the next section . here",
    ", we describe the problem in a general way in the framework of _ generalized projections _ : our data are various 1-d or 2-d projection types of a 3-d model , and understanding the fundamental mathematical properties of the inverse projection mapping is essential .",
    "this includes a number of theorems on uniqueness , information content , and stability properties @xcite .",
    "let the projection point @xmath0 in the image plane ( plane - of - sky or range - doppler ) of the point @xmath1 on the body be mapped by the matrix @xmath2 : @xmath3 . define the set @xmath4 for any @xmath5 as @xmath6 where we have explicitly shown the time @xmath7 and the adjustable parameters : @xmath8 for the shape and @xmath9 for the rotation .",
    "the projection point function @xmath10 if @xmath11 , and @xmath12 otherwise .",
    "the ray - tracing function @xmath13 if @xmath14 is visible ( for occultation , thermal , and radar data ) , or visible and illuminated ( for disk - resolved imaging and photometry in the optical ) ; otherwise @xmath15 .",
    "the set @xmath4 is numerable and finite .",
    "the number of elements in @xmath4 is at most one for plane - of - sky projections ( each point on the projection corresponds to at most one point of the asteroid s surface ) ; for range - doppler , it can be more ( more points on asteroid s surface can have the same distance to the observer and the same relative radial velocity ) .",
    "generalized projections , i.e. , all the data modes presented in sect .",
    "[ sec : data ] , can now be presented as scalar values @xmath16 in the image field @xmath17 : @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the luminosity parameters ( for scattering or thermal properties ) , and the luminosity function is denoted by @xmath20 .",
    "the function @xmath21 is the point - spread , pixellation , or other transfer function of the image field . for interferometry , it is typically the fourier transform kernel .",
    "in fact , the reconstruction process works efficiently by taking the fourier transform of any image type rather than using the original pixels @xcite . for lightcurves ,",
    "@xmath22 ( and @xmath5 is irrelevant , @xmath16 is constant ) .",
    "the surface albedo is usually assumed to be constant , although its variegation can be included in @xmath20 by the parameters @xmath19 if there are high - quality disk - resolved data . in the case of lightcurves",
    "only , we can get an indication of non - uniform albedo and compensate for this with a ( non - unique ) spot model @xcite .",
    "the multimodal inverse problem can be expressed as follows .",
    "let us choose as goodness - of - fit measures some functions @xmath23 , @xmath24 , of @xmath25 data modalities .",
    "typically , @xmath26 is the usual @xmath27-fit form between @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "our task is to construct a joint @xmath30 with weighting for each data mode : @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the data from the source @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the weight of the source @xmath33 , and @xmath35 is the set of model parameter values .",
    "the best - fit result is obtained by minimizing @xmath30 with nonlinear techniques , typically levenberg - marquardt for efficient convergence .",
    "regularization functions @xmath36 can be added to the sum ; these constrain , for instance , the smoothness of the surface to suppress large variations at small scales , the deviation from principal - axis rotation to force the model to rotate around the shortest inertia axis ( assuming uniform density ) , or the gravitational slope , etc . @xcite",
    ".    the modality ( and regularization ) weights @xmath37 are determined using the maximum compatibility estimate ( mce ) principle @xcite .",
    "this yields well - defined unique values that are , in essence , the best compromise between the different data sets that often tend to draw the solution in different directions .",
    "moreover , mce values of weighting parameters are objective , not dependent on users choice , although their values are usually close to those determined subjectively based on experience . plotting various choices of weights",
    "typically results in an l - shaped curve shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_hertha_occ_weight ] ; the best solution is at the corner of the curve . in this way , the reconstruction from complementary data sources is possible even if no single data mode is sufficient for modeling alone .    for practical computations ,",
    "the surface is rendered as a polyhedron , and @xmath20 and @xmath38 are computed accordingly with ray - tracing @xcite .",
    "rather than using each vertex as a free parameter , the surface can be represented in a more compact form with spherical harmonics series ( for starlike or octantoid ; i.e. , generalized starlike , shapes ) or subdivision control points @xcite .",
    "these _ shape supports _ are essential for convergence : they allow flexible modifications of the surface with a moderate number of parameters while not getting stuck in local minima or over - emphasizing the role of regularization functions when searching for the best - fit solution .",
    "each shape support has its own characteristic way of representing global and local features .",
    "for example , the octantoid parametrization @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 are linear combinations of the ( real ) spherical harmonic functions @xmath43 , with coefficients @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , respectively , is easy to regularize globally while retaining the ability to produce local details .",
    "the coordinates @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , parametrize the surface on the unit sphere @xmath50 but do not represent any physical directions such as polar coordinates .",
    "this inverse problem is a typical example of a case where model and systematic errors dominate over random measurement errors .",
    "thus the stability and error estimation of the solution are best examined by using different model types ( fig .  [",
    "fig : daphne_shapes ] ) . in the case of shape , for example",
    ", the reliability of the features on the solution can be checked by comparing the results obtained with two or more shape supports ( starlike , octantoid , subdivision ; * ? ? ?",
    "this yields better estimates than , e.g. , markov chain monte carlo sequences that only investigate random error effects within a single model type .",
    "a particular feature of the model reconstruction from disk - resolved data is that the result is dominated by the target image boundaries rather than the pixel brightness distribution within the target image .",
    "this is because the information is contained in the pixel contrast which is the largest on the boundary ( occultations are special cases of this as they are samples of the boundary contour ) .",
    "this is very advantageous when considering the effect of model errors in luminosity properties ( scattering or thermal models ) : it is sufficient to have a reasonable model , and the result is not sensitive to the parameters @xmath19 .",
    "thus , for example , atacama large millimeter array data can be used for efficient reconstruction even with a very approximate semianalytical fourier - series thermal model ",
    "more detailed models have hardly any effect on the shape solution ( sect .  [",
    "sec : interferometry ] , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we describe all data types that can be used , the way of collecting the data , their accuracy , typical number of asteroids for which the data exist , and expectations for the future .",
    "we also discuss a typical result of inversion ",
    "what is the resolution of the model and how many targets can be modeled ( table  [ tab : tech ] ) .",
    "disk - integrated photometry is , and will always be , the most abundant source of data , because it is available for essentially every single known asteroid . because asteroid brightness periodically changes with its rotation , frequency analysis of asteroid lightcurves provides asteroid rotation periods  the basic physical property derivable from time - resolved photometry .",
    "the regularly updated asteroid lightcurve database of @xcite available at http://www.minorplanet.info/lightcurvedatabase.html now contains rotation periods and other physical parameters for almost 7000 objects , for about half of them their rotation period is secure and unambiguous .",
    "the role of amateur astronomers in this field is traditionally strong , getting even stronger with increasing level of their technical and software equipment .",
    "hundreds of asteroid lightcurves are published quarterly in the minor planet bulletin ; most of them are then archived in the asteroid light curve database at the minor planet center site ( http://mpc.cfa.harvard.edu//light_curve2/light_curve.php ) in the alcdef standard @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of lightcurve production can be increased by dedicated wide - field photometric surveys ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) , although the period determination from undersampled lightcurves is often ambiguous @xcite .    for period determination ,",
    "a single lightcurve covering the full rotation is sufficient .",
    "however , a set of such lightcurves observed at different geometries ( asteroid illuminated and seen from various directions ) is needed to reconstruct the shape and spin state of an asteroid . the _ lightcurve inversion _ method of @xcite was already reviewed in _",
    "asteroids iii _ @xcite .",
    "since then , the method has been widely used and hundreds of asteroid models have been derived .",
    "they are publicly available at the database of asteroid models from inversion techniques ( damit , http://astro.troja.mff.cuni.cz/projects/asteroids3d ) .",
    "the reliability of the method was proved by comparing its results with independent data such as laboratory asteroid model @xcite , adaptive - optics images @xcite , stellar occultations @xcite , or spacecraft images of asteroids ( 2867 )  teins @xcite and ( 433 )  eros @xcite .    from disk - integrated photometry alone ,",
    "only a global shape without any small - scale details can be derived . because the reflectivity of the surface is not known , the models are not scaled and the information about the size has to come from complementary data . to avoid over - interpretation and artifacts of the modeling ,",
    "the shapes are usually represented by a _",
    "convex _ model .",
    "this allows to work not in the obvious radius parameter space but in the gaussian image space ( describing a convex body by the curvature of its surface ) .",
    "this is less intuitive but it makes the inverse problem less vulnerable to errors of data and model because of the minkowski stability @xcite  even if the areas of individual surface facets may change significantly for slightly different data sets , the global convex shape changes very little .    from the practical point of view , we are interested in finding a _ unique solution _ of the inverse problem .",
    "to guarantee this , observations covering a sufficiently wide range of viewing and illumination geometries are needed . for a typical main - belt asteroid , it means observations during several apparitions . for a close - approaching near - earth asteroid , several months could be sufficient . for more distant objects , we can in principle",
    "observe changing lightcurve amplitude because of changing aspect , this would anyway take many decades .",
    "nevertheless , trans - neptunian objects ( tnos ) and centaurs can be never observed from earth at geometry significantly different from opposition , which is not sufficient to reconstruct a unique convex model @xcite .",
    "if the lightcurves observed in various filters are different , there is some spectral / color variegation over the surface , and a crude color map can be reconstructed @xcite .",
    "+   +   +    a typical outcome of lightcurve inversion is a convex shape model that describes the global characteristics of the real asteroid .",
    "it is also easy to obtain nonconvex versions with the general inversion procedures ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : inversion ] ) , but then one should produce several solutions with various model types and parameters , and be very cautious about the results @xcite . in general , disk - integrated photometry contains very little information about nonconvexities unless they are very pronounced or observed at very high phase angles where shadowing effects play an important role @xcite .",
    "nonconvex models seldom fit lightcurves better than convex ones simply because the latter typically already fit the data down to noise level .",
    "this sets the resolution limit of photometry ( see the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the relative accuracy of the sidereal rotation period determined from lightcurves is of the order of @xmath51 or better , depending mainly on the time span of observations .",
    "the direction of the spin axis can be determined with an accuracy from a couple of degrees for the models based on many decades of observations with many dense lightcurves , to more than twenty degrees for models based on limited and noisy data . for asteroids orbiting in the ecliptic plane ,",
    "the geometry for an earth - based observer is limited to that plane .",
    "then the disk - integrated brightness of a body with surface described by radius vector @xmath52 and pole direction @xmath53 in ecliptic coordinates is the same as for a body @xmath54 with the spin axis direction @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "that is why for a typical main - belt asteroid , there are usually two equally good mirror shape solutions with about the same pole latitude and pole longitude difference of about 180@xmath56 . this ambiguity can be removed with disk - resolved plane - of - sky projections ( e.g. , images , stellar occultations , see sect .",
    "[ sec : img ] , [ sec : occ ] ) .    apart from `` classical '' lightcurves where the sampling of brightness variations is dense with respect to the rotation period",
    ", there are also data that are _ sparse in time_. such data sets typically consist of only a single to a few brightness measurements per night .",
    "provided the whole sparse data set is internally calibrated , it can be used the same way as a standard lightcurve that would be extremely long and very sparsely sampled @xcite .",
    "these data are routinely provided by all - sky astrometric surveys with various  usually poor  photometric quality .",
    "current surveys provide data of accuracy scarcely better than 0.1mag . given a typical lightcurve amplitude of 0.3mag , the signal is often drowned in noise and systematic errors .",
    "this leads to many physically acceptable models fitting the data to the noise level @xcite . however , the total amount of data is huge and it has been shown that at least for some asteroids , models can be successfully derived from these data or from their combination with dense lightcurves @xcite .",
    "as an example , we show sparse photometry for asteroid ( 21 )  lutetia from us naval observatory ( 260 points covering ten years ) in fig .",
    "[ fig_lutetia_sparse_lc_fit ] and the period search results in fig .",
    "[ fig_lutetia_period_search ] .",
    "the best - fit model based on this data set has the same rotation period and a similar spin axis direction as the models based on much larger and multiple data sets ( fig .",
    "[ fig_lutetia_models ] ) .    when using noisy sparse data or only a limited number of data points , a simple shape model of a triaxial ellipsoid is usually sufficient to model the data and to derive the correct period and spin vector orientation @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that the shape is described by only two parameters ( axes ratios ) and the scanning of the period parameter space is much faster than with general shapes .",
    "the on - going ( pan - starrs , catalina , gaia ) and future ( atlas , lsst ) surveys will provide new data every night for essentially every known asteroid . using this data for automated lightcurve inversion with well - mastered treatment of systematic effects , recognition of the best - fit models , definition of uniqueness of the solution etc . , is the main challenge for the future lightcurve inversion .",
    "the most direct way to obtain information on the shape of an asteroid is to take pictures of it .",
    "the apparent shape as visible on the plane of the sky is delimited by the limb and the terminator , and multiple views obtained while the target rotates can fully characterize its 3-d shape .",
    "to resolve the small angular diameter ( @xmath570.5 ) sustained by asteroids , large facilities are , however , required .    in the 1980s , speckle imaging or speckle interferometry provided `` _ _ the first glimpses of an asteroid s surface _",
    "( i.e. , ( 4 ) vesta by * ? ? ?",
    "this technique is based on the analysis of the speckle pattern in the images of astronomical sources obtained through large telescopes at high magnification power and very short integration time .",
    "the aim is to overcome the blurring effects due to the astronomical seeing and to attain diffraction - limited resolution images .",
    "speckle interferometry has been commonly used to study the size , shapes , and surface features of the largest asteroids @xcite . with the launch of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) in orbit and the first light of the large ( 10-m class ) ground - based telescopes equipped with adaptive - optics",
    "fed cameras ( e.g. , w. m. keck , european southern observatory ( eso ) very large telescope ( vlt ) , geminis , subaru ) , the importance of speckle interferometry has decreased .",
    "the critical issue in direct imaging is of course the angular resolution .",
    "any image is the result of the convolution of the object on the plane of the sky with the instrument response , the point spread function ( psf ) . in space ,",
    "the psf is stable and corresponds to the diffraction pattern of the telescope . from the ground",
    ", the atmospheric turbulence constantly deforms the psf and blurs the images , hence the need of real - time correction of the psf by adaptive optics ( ao ) .",
    "the technical challenges of sending a large telescope in space and of building deformable mirrors , explain why the first disk - resolved images in the 1990s were still limited in resolution and only the largest asteroids ( 1 )  ceres , ( 2 )  pallas , and ( 4 )  vesta have been imaged .",
    "in the decade since _",
    "asteroids iii _ , numerous studies have been based on direct imaging of asteroids .    both from space or with adaptive optics on the ground , however , the contrast and angular resolution can be improved by deconvolution of the image by the psf .",
    "this is particularly true for images acquired from the ground with residuals from non - perfect ao correction .",
    "deconvolution is an ill - posed problem , but robust algorithms adapted to planetary images are available @xcite and have been validated on sky @xcite .",
    "it is nevertheless the most critical part of the post - processing , as an incorrect deconvolution can introduce a systematic error on the apparent size .",
    "an example of an ao image and the reconstructed shape model for asteroid ( 41 )  daphne is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : daphne_ao ]    current facilities deliver an angular resolution of about 30 to 50 milliarcseconds ( mas ) , depending on the wavelength .",
    "the apparent shape can therefore be measured for asteroids with an apparent diameter larger than @xmath5880100 mas , i.e. , a couple of hundred targets . simulations and observations of known targets such as the satellites of saturn @xcite have shown that a precision of a few mas can be derived on the 2-d profile on the plane of the sky , corresponding to only a few kilometers for main - belt asteroids . with upcoming large telescopes ( 30+m , such as the thirty meter telescope or the european extremely large telescope ) , the angular resolution will be improved by a factor 34 , providing more than 500 targets .",
    "second generation instruments with extreme ao foreseen on these telescopes should allow the observation of about 7000 asteroids , with sizes of only a few kilometers @xcite .    using disk - resolved images ,",
    "giant craters have been discovered @xcite , ambiguity in spin solutions have been solved @xcite , albedo maps have been constructed @xcite , convex 3-d shape models from lightcurves have been set to scale @xcite , and full 3-d shape models determined @xcite .",
    "asteroid imaging and mapping _ in situ _ is essentially an extreme example of disk - resolved images .",
    "the modeling in such cases is more a cartographic than an inverse problem as the data are abundant , directly usable ( containing identification points on the surface , etc . ) , and high - resolution ( there is no ill - posedness ) .",
    "however , asteroid _ flybys _ , during which roughly a half of the target is likely to remain unseen ( not visible and illuminated ) , pose a special problem : how to see the dark side ?",
    "the principle here is to use the high - resolution map of the seen side , constructed with a number of methods of photoclinometry , photogrammetry , and image fitting @xcite , as a constraint in the otherwise same multi - mode inverse problem as with ground - based observations .",
    "the procedure is described in @xcite ; with it , the reconstruction of the dark side , such as those of ( 2867 )  teins @xcite or ( 21 )  lutetia ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also fig .",
    "[ fig_lutetia_models ] ) , is more detailed than from , e.g. , lightcurves alone .",
    "this is because half of the target is accurately reconstructed , with practically no error margin : therefore the fluctuation margin of the dark side is considerably smaller as well .",
    "the observation of a stellar occultation consists in recording the duration of the disappearance of a star behind the asteroid . knowing the apparent motion of the asteroid on the plane of the sky , obtained from its ephemeris , this duration can be converted in a physical length on the disk of the asteroid , called a chord .",
    "provided several observers record the same event from different locations on earth , the 2-d profile of the asteroid is drawn on the plane of the sky @xcite . the main difference with disk - resolved imaging resides in the profile , made by only the limb for occultations , and limb+terminator for imaging . in fine , both techniques provide the 2-d profile of the target as projected on the plane of the sky at the epoch of observations ( fig .",
    "[ fig_hertha_occ ] ) .",
    "disk - resolved imaging and stellar occultation are , however , radically different in term of facilities , data processing , potential targets , reproducibility , and achievable precision . for stellar occultations , the properties of the occulted star matter generally more than the actual target : the asteroid .",
    "if the occulted star is bright enough , its occultation , even by a very small asteroid , can be detected with small aperture telescopes .",
    "this is of course the main advantage of stellar occultations , where the apparent size and shape of potentially any asteroid can be measured .",
    "moreover , this technique can be successfully used also for distant tnos , which have angular sizes too small to be resolved by imaging @xcite . in practice , however , a given asteroid will only seldom occult bright stars .",
    "measurements are thus hard , if not impossible , to reproduce .",
    "stellar occultations are nevertheless extremely valuable .",
    "the accuracy of the timing is dictated by time - series photometry , and can therefore be extremely precise .",
    "an uncertainty of 50ms in timings converts into only a 300 m uncertainty in the length of the chord , typical for a main - belt asteroid ( at 1.5au from earth with an apparent motion of 10/h ) .",
    "the main source of uncertainty is , however , the absolute timing of each chord , required to align them on the plane of the sky .",
    "most of historical occultations were recorded by naked eye , and suffered from this . since a decade ago , thanks to the availability of low - cost positioning and timing systems ( e.g. , gps ) , stellar occultations are being more and more valuable .    the main contributors to the field",
    "are currently amateur astronomers : for a given event , observers have to move to set themselves on the predicted occultation path on earth .",
    "small aperture ( @xmath5720 cm ) mobile stations are therefore ideal for recording stellar occultations . because of the uncertainties of the star and asteroid positions on sky",
    ", there is generally an uncertainty of a few tens of kilometers in the location of the occultation path on earth , requiring observers to spread over large area to cover the event .",
    "this usually prohibits dense coverage of the asteroid profile .",
    "when only a couple of chords are available , the event provides only limited information on the size , if any on the shape .",
    "current occultation predictions of sufficient accuracy concern only stars in the hipparcos catalogue and large ( at least tens of kilometers ) asteroids . with the upcoming publication of the esa gaia stellar catalog , and update of asteroid orbits",
    ", this position uncertainty is expected to drop significantly and future occultations will be easier to predict , hence observe @xcite .",
    "overall , stellar occultations can provide precise measurements of the size and shape of an asteroid , as projected on the plane of the sky .",
    "however , events are rare for a given target .",
    "occultations are therefore very valuable in combined data sets , as for instance , to set scale to otherwise dimensionless 3-d shape models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from almost 2500 occultations compiled by @xcite , there are about 160 `` good '' ones that allow a reliable determination of asteroid s size and about 40 `` excellent '' ones that show details in asteroid s profile .      another technique to overcome the limitations of small angular sizes of asteroids , in order to measure their sizes , shapes , and possible presence of satellites , is interferometry .",
    "an astronomical interferometer combines coherently ( i.e. , conserving the phase information ) the light from two or more apertures of the same telescope or of distinct telescopes spaced by a distance @xmath59 . the spatial resolution ( in radians )",
    "is of the order of @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the wavelength .    in the following ,",
    "we give a basic introduction to interferometry of asteroids .",

    "+    interferometers measure the coherence function of the source , also called the interferometric visibility , which is given by the ratio between the correlated and the total flux . the correlated flux is the amount of flux in the interferometric fringes .",

    "a clear limitation of hst / fgs asteroid studies is the bright limiting magnitude of the instrument of about @xmath6214mag .",
    "a recapitulation of the hst / fgs asteroids results can be found in @xcite .",
    "ground - based interferometry is limited to observation of bright targets because of the requirement to take exposures shorter than the atmospheric coherence time of a few milliseconds .",
    "the limiting magnitudes of ground - based long - baseline interferometers and the intrinsic low surface brightness of asteroids , have prevented the use of these instruments for the studies of small solar system bodies until the availability of the vlti .",
    "interferometry in the mid - infrared was proven to be also very sensitive to the global shape of asteroids and also to their surface characteristics @xcite .",
    "in particular , since observations are typically carried out in the thermal infrared ( 813@xmath63 m ) , midi data are sensitive to the surface temperature distribution , which is strongly affected by the value of the thermal inertia ( _ delbo et al .",

    "what is more , the reconstruction of the overall shape is insensitive to inaccuracies and uncertainties in the thermal model used because the model is determined mainly by the boundary of the projection , the distribution of brightness inside the boundary is much less important @xcite .",

    "the separation of the components of these systems is too narrow for traditional observational techniques such as ao at 10-m class telescopes .      the esa gaia mission , whose operations started in 2014 , will provide accurate astrometry and photometry of asteroids .",

    "being designed as an astrometry mission at the @xmath63as level , the psf of gaia is accurately known and stable .",
    "deviations of the psf from that of a point - like source can thus be measured and used to estimate the apparent size of asteroids .",
    "owing to the amount of sources observed by gaia , the satellite does not download images to earth , but only 1-d flux profiles , corresponding to small 2-d windows centered on targets , stacked along one direction , similar to interferometry in that respect .",
    "interpretation of this 1-d profile relies therefore on the _ a priori _ knowledge of the 2-d flux distribution on the plane of the sky . in the creation of gaia catalog ,",
    "this will be done iteratively , starting from simple spheres at zero phase angle to finally use the spin and tri - axial ellipsoid solutions determined otherwise from gaia photometry @xcite .",
    "these measurements represent a great opportunity for multi - data inversion algorithms : the measurement of the extension is direct , but clearly requires a realistic description of the projected shape on the plane of the sky .",
    "considering gaia specifications and observing geometry , @xcite have estimated the fraction of asteroids for which 1-d dimension will be measured with a precision better than 10% .",
    "this fraction is highly dependent on diameter , and 20% of asteroids between 2030 km will be measured at least once , while all asteroids larger than @xmath6480 km will be measured repeatedly .",
    "measurements of asteroids emission in the thermal infrared  in general at wavelengths between 45 and 2030@xmath63 m   are mostly used to determine the sizes of these bodies .",

    "the background also receives contribution from the telescope and the optics .",
    "hence , the thermal infrared observation of asteroids from the ground is limited to relatively bright asteroids ( @xmath70mag with 10-m class telescopes ) .",
    "absolute calibration of the flux is rarely better than 510% . on the other hand , in space",

    "the problem becomes complicated when the system is asynchronous , i.e. , when the rotation period of the primary is different from the orbital period of the secondary .",

    "unsuspected physics has been unveiled with the modeling of the near - earth asteroid ( 66391 ) 1999 kw@xmath73 by @xcite .",
    "some small asteroids present an equatorial bulge , presumably generated by regolith migration toward lower gravity regions .",
    "this process can even form binary systems if the asteroids spin fast enough @xcite .",
    "+      an evident outcome of shape modeling is the capability to detect large impact craters and basins . aside from the spacecraft encounters ,",
    "the first detection was the large impact basin on vesta , progenitor of the vestoids @xcite , detected with the hst @xcite and confirmed by nasa dawn spacecraft @xcite .",
    "another case is the recent impact suffered by asteroids ( 596 ) scheila , detected by the presence of a dust tail @xcite .",
    "lightcurves obtained before and after the impact , under similar geometries are different , revealing different surface properties @xcite .",

    "this question is intrinsically tied with the study of the gravity field around the asteroid .",
    "the latter has been measured during spacecraft encounters ( see * ? ? ? * for instance ) , but studies from earth - bound observations have recently appeared .",
    "by comparing the spherical harmonics of the gravity field as determined from the orbit of a natural satellite , with the expected coefficients resulting from the 3-d shape model , the hypothesis of homogeneous mass distribution can be tested @xcite .",
    "in the decade since _ asteroids iii _ , where the principles of lightcurve inversion based on dense - in - time series were presented @xcite , the number of models has seen a tenfold increase  from a few tens to a few hundreds ( table  [ tab : tech ] ) . the increasing availability of sparse - in - time photometry , and its appropriate handling in the inversion , coupled with a dramatic increase of computer time ( thanks to projects like asteroids@home ) have made this possible .",
    "upcoming all - sky surveys such as pan - starrs , lsst , and gaia are expected to produce enormous data sets and there is little doubt that thousands of models will be derived in the next decade .",
    "our knowledge on non - gravitational effects such as yorp and yarkovsky will directly benefit from this larger sample .    with the large number of data and models",
    ", new challenges will arise  how to extract scientifically interesting information from a large set of models of asteroids ?",
    "with big data flows , the processing has to be automated , with effective data processing .",
    "the obvious search for correlations has to be done with care because of large biases in the set of models .",
    "although the importance of detailed models of individual well - studied asteroids will be important , the main shift in paradigm and probably the main source of interesting findings will be in tens of thousands of asteroid models derived from photometry in optical and thermal infrared wavelengths . only a few years ago",
    ", only photometry in the visible was available for a large number of asteroids .",
    "the situation drastically changed with wise catalog of thermal fluxes for 150,000 asteroids .",
    "automatized procedures capable of dealing with photometry in the visible and thermal infrared will yield not only 3-d shape and spin state for thousands of asteroids , but also their diameter , albedo , and thermal inertia of their surface .",
    "the later being crucial in interpreting asteroid mineralogy once coupled with spectroscopy ( _ reddy et al .",
    "_ , this volume ) .",
    "understanding of observational and modeling biases will be crucial for correct interpretation of the results .",
    "connecting spin and shape distribution of asteroids with their orbital and spin evolution will hopefully lead to a clear picture of the evolution of the main asteroid belt .",
    "the ultimate goal here is the connection of models of evolution of the main belt with spin - axis evolution and current distribution of asteroid physical properties .",
    "another approach that is complementary to modeling individual objects , is modeling distribution functions of parameters of interest . with any inversion technique and photometric data quality",
    ", the number of models will be always much lower than the number of known asteroids just because it takes time to collect enough data at different geometries .",
    "so instead of aiming to create unique models for a statistically significant sample of the ( sub)populations with known observational and modeling bias , one can use other observables than the time  brightness pairs . with this approach",
    ", there is almost no `` wasting '' of data because essentially all photometric points are used in the statistical approach .",
    "the aim is to model characteristics of a given asteroid population as a whole when there are not enough data to model individual members .",
    "one of the observables can be , for example , the mean brightness over one apparition @xcite and its dispersion that correlates with lightcurve amplitude .",
    "if there are not enough data points to estimate mean brightness and its variance , the statistics of scatter of individual pairs of observations can be used @xcite .",
    "if the data come in pairs of observations separated by a constant time interval ( like with pan - starrs ) , the rotation period can be estimated @xcite .",
    "another challenge for next decade resides in the derivation of a large sample of higher - resolution models , based on multiple data sources .",
    "building inversion techniques capable of handling different data sources had been highlighted in _",
    "asteroids iii _ as the next step , and this became reality over the past few years .",
    "the models based on multiple data sources are more realistic , more reliable , more precise than the independent analysis of individual data sets .",
    "if practical issues of merging data sets arise , mathematical solution have been exposed , and algorithms and software are ready and freely available .",
    "the current sample of models derived by such methods is nevertheless still limited .",
    "if the multi data analysis is more efficient than the independent analysis of the individual data sets , the practical problem of data sharing arises .",
    "although the tools to invert multiple data sources are ready and freely available , the data are still hard to get and harder to share . to maximize the scientific output ,",
    "it is necessary to combine all available data sources .",
    "the other observing techniques ( i.e. , disk - resolved imaging , stellar occultations , gaia size measurements , or radar echoes ) will never provide data for more than a few thousands asteroids .",
    "the apparent sizes by gaia will however be measured with a high precision , and will concern a decent sized sample .",
    "because the data will be made public , they should be used on a regular basis for modeling .",
    "the number and quality of profiles derived from stellar occultations have always been restricted due to the intrinsic complexity of prediction , and cost of equipment .",
    "the parallel availability of low - cost telescopes and cameras , together with the publication of gaia stellar catalog and asteroid orbits , will open a new age for stellar occultations .",
    "any mass - production procedure of asteroid models should therefore be able to deal not only with photometry ( visible and infrared ) but also with stellar occultations .    finally ,",
    "if the bulk of asteroids are single objects , rotating along their shortest axis , a small fraction will either be in tumbling state , or have satellites .",
    "automatic modeling procedures should be able to detect such cases , triggering detailed analysis of these peculiar targets .",
    "the rising interest of private companies for near - earth objects as mining resources will inevitably lead to further development of analysis of remote - sensing data , building dedicated ground - based or space telescopes , and eventually moving from asteroids surface into their interiors .    *",
