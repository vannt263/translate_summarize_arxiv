    "the aim of this paper is to describe a process of creation of hyperbolicity in a _ partially hyperbolic _ context called the _ transversality - torsion phenomenon _ introduced in ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "this process comes from the study of instability ( arnold diffusion ) for ( at least ) three degrees of freedom near - integrable hamiltonian systems @xcite and more precisely from the derivation of a smale - birkhoff theorem ( @xcite,@xcite ) for transversal homoclinic partially hyperbolic tori which come along multiple resonances @xcite .",
    "our starting point is the following conjecture of r.w .",
    "easton ( @xcite , p.252 ) about _ symbolic dynamics _ for transversal homoclinic partially hyperbolic tori : in @xcite , easton prove the existence of symbolic dynamics in a neighbourhood of a partially hyperbolic torus whose stable and unstable manifolds intersect transversally ( in a given energy manifold containing the torus ) .",
    "this result is obtained under hypothesis , the most stringent one being on the linear part of the _ homoclinic map _ ( see @xmath0.[mise ] for a definition and @xcite , p.244 ) , called the _",
    "homoclinic matrix_. however , easton conjectures ( @xcite , p.252 ) that this assumption can be weakened , or perhaps cancelled .",
    "moreover , the role of all the parameters of the problem ( transversality , torsion of the flow around the torus ) is not clear .",
    "+ in ( @xcite,@xcite ) , we weaken the homoclinic matrix condition , but mainly , we put in evidence a dynamical and geometrical phenomenon at the origin of the _ hyperbolic nature _ of symbolic dynamics , the _ transversality - torsion phenomenon _ : the transversality of the stable and unstable manifold of the torus coupled with the torsion of the flow around the torus give rise to a hyperbolic dynamics in the neighbourhood of the homoclinic connection . since this first study , the transversality - torsion phenomenon has been identified and extended by others .",
    "we refer in particular to the papers of m. gidea and c. robinson ( @xcite p.64 ) and m. gidea and r. de la llave @xcite , dealing with topological methods in dynamics .",
