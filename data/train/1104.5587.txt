    "@xmath1 meson has been attracting lots of attention in recent years . as the sole heavy quark meson that contains two different heavy flavors , its unique property attracts more and wide interests .",
    "ever since its first discovery at the tevatron @xcite , till now , various investigations on its production and decays have been carried out in aspects of theory @xcite and experiment @xcite . @xmath1",
    "meson provides an excellent platform for testing the standard model(sm ) and effective theories , e.g. , to see whether non - relativistic qcd(nrqcd ) @xcite is suitable for such system or not . in foreseeable near future",
    ", the @xmath2 physics study at the large hadron collider(lhc ) will tell us more about the nature of this special heavy bound system .    of the @xmath1 meson production ,",
    "apart from the direct ones , the indirect yields , like in top @xcite and @xmath0 @xcite decays , are also important sources .",
    "the process of @xmath0 decays to @xmath1 has an advantage of low background , but also with the disadvantage of low production rate , which prompts the lep - i experiment unable to observe the @xmath1 signature @xcite . in the future ,",
    "if a high luminosity , @xmath3 or higher , electron - position collider , e.g. internal linear collider(ilc ) @xcite , can set up , it would then be possible to study the @xmath2 meson indirect production in @xmath0 decays . as estimated by ref.@xcite , there would be @xmath4 @xmath0 events produced each year at the ilc . such kind of high luminosity collider , the so - called `` z factory '' @xcite , will provide new opportunities for both electroweak study and hadron physics .",
    "the indirect production of @xmath1 meson in @xmath0 decays was evaluated by several groups at the leading order(lo ) in strong interaction @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that in charm- and bottom - quark energy regions , the higher order corrections of strong interaction are usually big , sometimes even huge . in order to make a more solid prediction on the @xmath2 production in @xmath5 decays , and to depress the energy scale dependence lying at the lo calculation , an evaluation on the next - to - leading order(nlo ) correction is necessary , which is the aim of this work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : after the introduction , in section ii we repeat the leading order calculation on the @xmath5 to @xmath2 decay width . in section iii , the nlo virtual and real qcd corrections to born level result are performed . in section iv",
    ", the numerical calculation for the process at nlo accuracy is done .",
    "the last section is remained for summary and conclusions .",
    "at the leading order in @xmath6 , there are four feynman diagrams for @xmath1 production in @xmath5 decays , the @xmath7 , as shown in fig.[graph1 ] .",
    "the momentum of each particle is assigned as : @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 . for @xmath15 and @xmath16 quark hadronization to @xmath17 meson",
    ", we employ the following commonly used projection operator @xmath18 here , @xmath19 stands for the unit color matrix , and @xmath20 for qcd .",
    "the nonperturbative parameter @xmath21 is the schrdinger wave function at the origin of the @xmath22 bound states . in our calculation , the non - relativistic relation @xmath23 is also adopted .",
    "production in @xmath0 decays.,width=566,height=377 ]    the lo amplitudes for @xmath17 production can then be readily obtained with above preparations .",
    "they are : @xmath24}{(\\not\\!p_{1 } -\\not\\!p_{3}-m_{b})({p_{4}+p_{5}})^{2}}~i\\gamma_{5 } ( \\not\\!p_{0}+m_{{b}_c})\\gamma^{\\mu}v(p_{5})\\ ; , \\label{eq:4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath25}{({p_{3}+p_{6}})^{2}(\\not\\!p_{1}- \\not\\!p_{4}-m_{c})}\\gamma_{\\mu}v(p_{5})\\;,\\label{eq:5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath26}{(\\not\\!p_{1}-\\not\\!p _ { 5}-m_{c})({p_{3}+p_{6}})^{2}}v(p_{5})\\;,\\label{eq:6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath27}{({p_{4}+p_{5}})^{2}(\\not \\!p_{1}-\\not\\!p_{6}-m_{b})}\\gamma^{\\mu}~i\\gamma_{5}(\\not \\!p_{0}+m_{{b}_c})\\gamma_{\\mu}v(p_{5})\\ ; .\\label{eq:6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath28 , @xmath29 are color indices , @xmath30 belongs to the @xmath31 color structure .",
    "@xmath32 is the weinberg angle with the numerical value @xmath33 .",
    "the born amplitude of the processes shown in fig.[graph1 ] is then @xmath34 , and subsequently , the decay width at lo reads : @xmath35 here , @xmath36 symbolizes the sum over polarizations and colors of the initial and final particles , @xmath37 comes from spin average of initial @xmath0 meson , @xmath38 stands for the integrals of three - body phase space , whose concrete form can be expressed as : @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are mandelstam variables .",

    "at the next - to - leading order , the @xmath0 boson decay to @xmath17 includes the virtual and real qcd corrections to the leading order process .",
    "for the two kinds of vertices , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , we need only to consider one of them , e.g. as shown in figs.[graph2]-[graph5 ] , since they are similar . for the virtual corrections , the decay width at the nlo",
    "can be formulated as @xmath48                  in dimensional regularization scheme , @xmath70 is an object hard to handle ; especially in the process that contains the vector - axial current , things become more complicated . in our work , we adopt the scheme provided in ref.@xcite , where the following rules must be obeyed :    i. the cyclicity is forbidden in traces involving odd number of @xmath70 .    \\ii . for the certain diagrams that contribute to a process ,",
    "we must write down the amplitudes starting at the same vertex , named the reading point .    \\iii . as a special case of rule",
    "ii , if the anomalous axial current exists , the reading point of the anomalous diagrams must be the axial vector vertex , in order to guarantee the conservation of the vector current .    by utilizing this rule in our process , the two anomalous diagrams denoted as @xmath71 and @xmath72 in fig.[graph3 ] are calculated , and the uv divergences in these two diagrams are canceled by each other . to deal with the @xmath73 except for what in anomalous diagrams , the cyclicity is employed to move the @xmath73 together and then are contracted by @xmath74 .",
    "hence , if a trace contains even number of @xmath70 , there will be no @xmath70 left . otherwise , after the contraction of odd number of @xmath70 , one remains .    in the virtual correction ,",
    "ir divergences remain in the triangle and box diagrams .",
    "of all the triangle diagrams , only two have ir divergences , which are denoted by @xmath75 and @xmath76 in fig.[graph3 ] . of the diagrams in fig.[graph4 ]",
    ", @xmath77 has no ir divergence , @xmath78 has merely the coulomb singularity , @xmath79 has both a coulomb singularity and ordinary ir divergence , and the remaining other diagrams have only the ordinary ir divergences .",
    "we find that the combinations of @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 are ir finite , while the remaining ir singularities in @xmath83 and @xmath84 are canceled by the corresponding parts in real corrections .",
    "the coulomb singularities existing in @xmath78 and @xmath85 can be regularized by the relative velocity @xmath49 .",
    "the @xmath86 terms are renormalized by the counter terms of external quarks which form the @xmath17 , while the @xmath87 term will be mapped onto the wave function of the concerned heavy meson . in the end ,",
    "the ir and coulomb divergences in virtual corrections can be expressed as @xmath88\\label{eq:14}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath8 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 . here , in this work @xmath86 in fact represents @xmath91 .",

    "the feynarts @xcite was used to generate the feynman diagrams , the amplitudes were generated by the feyncalc @xcite , and the looptools @xcite was employed to calculate the passarino - veltman integrations .",
    "the numerical integrations of the phase space were performed by the mathematica .",
    "to complete the numerical calculation , the following ordinarily accepted input parameters are taken into account : @xmath125 @xmath126 @xmath127 here , @xmath128 is radial wave function at the origin of @xmath1 meson , which is estimated via potential model @xcite and @xmath129 is fermi constant in weak interaction .",
    "the one loop result of strong coupling constant is taken into account in our calculation , i.e. @xmath130    with the above preparation , one can readily obtain the decay width of @xmath0 to @xmath2 meson in nlo accuracy of pqcd . in practice",
