    "the many flavours of synchrony that emerge as a consequence of different coupling scenarios have been examined in detail over the last couple of decades .",
    "the roles of topology and nonlinearity have been studied , and a fair understanding of the different forms of synchrony that can arise  given a specific scheme through which dynamical systems interact with each other  is understood to some degree @xcite .",
    "synchronization in various forms is common in forced and coupled nonlinear systems @xcite .",
    "the manner in which the interacting subsystems are coupled plays a crucial role in determining which form of synchrony arises .",
    "for example , when identical nonlinear systems are coupled unidirectionally with one subsystem ( the master ) driving the response subsystem ( the slave ) complete synchronization occurs .",
    "when the coupled systems are not identical , generalized synchronization can occur @xcite .",
    "`` mixed '' synchrony is observed in counter  rotating coupled oscillators @xcite while phase synchronization occurs in mutually coupled chaotic systems : the phases of interacting systems are entrained while the amplitudes remain uncorrelated @xcite .",
    "this is a phenomenon of great interest due to potential applications in different fields , ranging from physics , chemistry to biological and medical sciences @xcite .",
    "since the coupling can be uni or bi  directional and can be linear or nonlinear @xcite , and can be through similar or dissimilar variables @xcite , as the number of interacting components increases , the possible variations grow exponentially .",
    "our interest in present work is to examine a small number of `` typical '' patterns or motifs of coupling , and investigate the different patterns of synchronization phenomena that result .",
    "an additional motivation arises from the fact that in a variety of natural systems that are subject to forcing , the modulation can be either direct , namely when a given system is itself subject to driving , or indirect , when it is coupled to another system which is the one that is being modulated .",
    "such indirect modulation is likely to be operative in biological phenomena @xcite or in networks of coupled dynamical systems @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we study coupled chaotic oscillators which are externally forced .",
    "we find that as the number of mutually coupled oscillators increase , the phase synchronization ( ps ) regime gets truncated if the coupling is heterogeneous , namely through different variables , while the same does not hold if the coupling is homogeneous , namely through the same variables .",
    "the different coupling schemes are discussed in the following section ii where we also study phase synchronization between the drive and the response .",
