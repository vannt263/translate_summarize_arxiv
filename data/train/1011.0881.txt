    "it has been considered that a meson - nucleus system may exist as a quasi - bound state , mediated by strong interaction . for example",
    ", an antikaon attracts a nucleon very strongly in the isospin-0 channel , which is characterized by the existence of the @xmath3 resonance below the @xmath4 threshold .",
    "the possibility of a @xmath5 nuclear bound state is suggested  @xcite .",
    "its decay width can be very narrow when the states lies below the @xmath6 decay threshold , corresponding to @xmath7 binding of an antikaon .",
    "experimental searches and reanalyses of past experiments have been performed , some of which reported observations of the simplest kaon - nuclear bound state , @xmath8  @xcite , while the existence of such a state with its decay width narrow enough to be observed experimentally is still controversial .",
    "further experiments will be planned at j - parc , fopi and da@xmath9ne , aiming to settle this problem .    as well as a kaonic nucleus ,",
    "an @xmath0-mesic nucleus is also an interesting object to be investigated both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "the interaction between an @xmath0 meson and a nucleon is attractive , and the corresponding scattering length is estimated , with a large ambiguity , to be @xmath10@xcite . while the first calculation by haider and liu  @xcite indicated the existence of @xmath0-mesic nuclei for @xmath11 by using the scattering length of @xmath12 or @xmath13 , a larger scattering length may allow an @xmath0 meson to be bound in a lighter nucleus .",
    "the reason for the large uncertainty of the scattering length arises from the difficulty to extract its information from experimental data ; different from the case for charged pions or kaons , neither a scattering experiment in a direct way nor an x - ray measurement of mesic atoms is possible . then",
    ", experimental observables such as the binding energy and the decay width of an @xmath0-mesic nucleus  if it does exist and can be observed experimentally  will provide us important information on @xmath14 interaction .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath15 resonance plays an important role in near - threshold @xmath14 interaction , since the resonance lies only @xmath16 above the @xmath14 threshold , and it has a strong coupling with the @xmath14 channel . if the properties of the resonance change at finite density , the @xmath14 interaction will be different from that in free space , and this will affect the @xmath0-nucleus optical potential  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the main decay mode of an @xmath0-mesic nucleus will proceed via @xmath17 .    therefore , systematic investigations by using the same reaction on different nuclear targets to produce the known resonance of @xmath15 and @xmath0-mesic nuclei will be valuable for a better understanding of @xmath14 interaction both in free space and in nuclear medium .",
    "this strategy is almost the same as a series of j - parc experiments , to investigate the @xmath3 resonance by the ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) reaction on liquid deuterium target ( e31 experiment  @xcite ) , and to search for a kaon - bound state @xmath8 by the same reaction on liquid helium-3 target ( e15 experiment  @xcite ) .    in this paper ,",
    "a possibility to use the ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) reaction , which may be feasible at j - parc , will be discussed .",
    "the j - parc accelerator complex , located in tokai , japan , consists of a proton linac , and a @xmath20 rapid cycle synchrotron , and a @xmath21 main ring synchrotron .",
    "intense proton beam is extracted from the main ring , and is transported to a production target , where secondary particles , such as pions and kaons , are produced .",
    "these particles are guided to experimental areas through beamlines .",
    "as of summer 2010 , there are two beamlines for charged particles , k1.8 and k1.8br ( branch line of k1.8 ) , and the k1.1br beamline is under construction .",
    "their maximum momenta available are @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "secondary beams , especially kaons , were successfully observed in both the k1.8 and k1.8br beamlines in 2009 .",
    "already approved experiments , mainly on strangeness nuclear physics , are planned to start data taking at these beamlines . while pion beam with a proper momentum to investigate @xmath0-mesic nuclei can be extracted at either beamline , experimental plans by using the k1.8br beamline will be discussed in the following .    at the k1.8br beamline , the preparation of the e15 experiment  @xcite is going on .",
    "it aims to search for a deeply - bound kaonic nuclear states @xmath8 by the @xmath25 ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) reaction .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the setup in the k1.8br area .",
    "the k1.8br beamline is branched from the k1.8 beamline at a dipole magnet , drawn in the lower right of the figure .",
    "the helium-3 target will be located near the end of the beamline , and will be surrounded by the cylindrical detector system ( cds ) .",
    "the cds serves to detect the decay particles of the @xmath8 bound state into a @xmath26 and a proton .",
    "the cds consists of a solenoid magnet with a magnetic field of @xmath27 parallel to the beam axis , the cylindrical drift chamber ( cdc ) , and the cylindrical detector hodoscopes ( cdh ) .",
    "the momentum of a charged particle is obtained by reconstructing its trajectory by the cdc .",
    "the cdh , which locates outside of the cdc , is used for the trigger purpose and the particle identification .",
    "forward - scattered neutrons by the ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) reaction will be detected by an array of plastic scintillators , which will be put @xmath28 downstream from the target .    as well as",
    "the ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) reaction , the ( @xmath18 , @xmath29 ) reaction will be measured by adding plastic scintillators ( p28 experiment  @xcite , approved as a part of the e15 experiment ) . since a beam sweeping magnet will be located downstream of the target in the original e15 setup , scattered protons will be bent from the beam axis .",
    "installation of drift chambers between the target and the magnet will help to reconstruct the reaction vertex , together with the trajectory of the scattered proton .    while this setup is optimized for the e15/p28 experiments , a measurement of the ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) reaction is also possible with a small modification . as discussed below",
    ", the detection of the decay particles of @xmath0-mesic nuclei and @xmath15 is very important for improving the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the usage of the cds around the target is very suitable for this purpose .",
    "the first experiment to search for @xmath0-mesic nuclei was carried out at bnl by using the ( @xmath30 , @xmath29 ) reaction on lithium , carbon , oxygen , and aluminum targets  @xcite .",
    "the spectrometer was tilted by @xmath31 against the beam axis , which was the best condition according to a theoretical suggestion by liu and haider  @xcite .",
    "however , a peak structure corresponding to @xmath0-mesic nuclei was not observed for any of the targets .",
    "it does not necessarily mean that the ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) reaction is not a proper way to produce @xmath0-mesic nuclei .",
    "first , the momentum transfer is as large as @xmath32 for the scattering angle of @xmath31 ( see fig .  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "_ calculated the missing - mass spectra for the same reaction with different scattering angle ( @xmath33 and @xmath31 )  @xcite . for the former case , the magic momentum exists , so that the momentum transfer can be zero .",
    "then , only substitutional states are excited , because the angular momentum of the target nucleus should be conserved . on the other hand , many subcomponents of different configurations of a nucleon - hole and an @xmath0 meson will be populated , and they will hinder the observation of a possible contribution of @xmath0-mesic nuclei .    secondly , the inclusive spectrum chrien _",
    "_ obtained would contain a huge background from multi - pion production _ etc .",
    "_ , irrelevant to @xmath0 production .",
    "if they had used a decay counter for coincidence analysis , they might get a spectrum with a better signal - to - noise ratio .    for these reasons , there is still room to consider an experiment with the same reaction , which satisfies the recoilless condition .",
    "an exclusive measurement , the detection of decay particles of @xmath0-mesic nuclei ( @xmath34 ) , as the taps / mami experiment  @xcite and the cosy - gem experiment  @xcite have adopted , is mandatory .",
    "we proposed to study the ( @xmath35 , @xmath19 ) reaction , @xmath29 ) reaction because of the isospin symmetry . in the loi",
    ", we limited the discussion to the ( @xmath35 , @xmath19 ) reaction only , taking into account merits from an experimental point of view , but the other reaction may be feasible as well . ] on @xmath36 and @xmath37 targets at j - parc  @xcite , motivated by recent theoretical calculations on this reaction  @xcite .",
    "they focused on in - medium property of @xmath15 , to which an @xmath0 meson and a nucleon in an @xmath0-mesic nucleus couples ; the @xmath0-nucleus optical potential is attractive ( replusive ) when @xmath38 is negative ( positive ) , where @xmath39 is the @xmath0 energy , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are effective masses of @xmath2 and @xmath42 at nuclear density @xmath43 , respectively . in free space ,",
    "since the mass gap of @xmath42 and @xmath2 , i.e. @xmath44 , is larger than the @xmath0 meson mass , @xmath0-nucleus interaction is attractive at threshold . if the mass gap reduces at finite density and becomes smaller than the @xmath0 meson mass , the interaction near threshold will be repulsive . in the chiral doublet model , which treats a negative - parity @xmath15 baryon as the chiral partner of the nucleon",
    ", the mass gap is expected to reduce as a function of nuclear density @xmath43 . to the contrary , the mass gap will not change largely at finite density according to the chiral unitary model , since @xmath15 is regarded as a dynamically generated resonance of meson - baryon scattering , with a large contribution of the @xmath45 channel , and a @xmath46 baryon is free from the pauli blocking in a nucleus",
    ".    the beam momentum will be around @xmath47 so as to satisfy the recoilless condition .",
    "the scattered neutron ( proton ) will be detected by zero - degree detectors like the e15/p28 experiment .",
    "the decay particles of @xmath0-mesic nuclei , such as a proton and a @xmath35 , will be also identified by a decay counter .",
    "however , even though a proton and a @xmath35 are detected in coincidence , there still remain background events which do not associate with an @xmath0 meson . in order to estimate the background level in the actual experiment , a pilot experiment to investigate the elementary process by use of deuterium target , @xmath48 , because the @xmath15 serves as a doorway in forming @xmath0-mesic nuclei .",
    "the background mentioned above may correspond to an event which does not produce a @xmath49 baryon in the @xmath50 reaction .",
    "the detail of the @xmath50 reaction will be discussed in the next section .",
    "a clear signal to identify the production of the @xmath15 baryon is to identify the @xmath52 decay , since its branching ratio is 4560%  @xcite , significantly larger than that from other @xmath42 baryons .",
    "therefore , the cross section of the reaction : @xmath53 will give a good estimation of the @xmath15 production cross section .",
    "it should be noted that this final state can be originated not only from a double - scattering reaction ( fig .",
    "[ fig2a ] ) , but also from a quasi - free reaction ( fig .  [ fig2b ] ) , and",
    "their contributions should be distinguished experimentally .",
    "the double - scattering reaction is a two - step process , the elementary process of @xmath54 , followed by the rescattering of the @xmath0 meson , and it is similar to the formation of @xmath0-mesic nuclei by the ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) reaction , except for the target of the rescattering process with the @xmath0 meson . as the spectator proton in the quasi - free reaction has a small momentum , the detection of two protons in the final state in the laboratory system easily stops in the target itself , which means most of spectators protons can not be detected without some effort .",
    "] will suppress the contribution of the quasi - free process .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the momentum transfer for this reaction with the scattering angle @xmath33 , together with that for the quasi - free reaction .",
    "when the beam momentum is around @xmath55 , the momentum of the @xmath15 baryon is small .    on the other hand , the reaction with a different final state : @xmath56 corresponds to the actual measurement about @xmath0-mesic nuclei",
    ". some of the @xmath15 baryon via the double - scattering reaction can decay into @xmath57 , but other reactions , such as the rescattering of @xmath1 or @xmath43 mesons , will contribute to this final state .",
    "if we compare the differential cross section of the reactions ( [ re1 ] ) and ( [ re2 ] ) for the same forward - going proton momentum , or the same energy of @xmath58 or @xmath57 system , we will be able to estimate the contribution of @xmath15 in the reaction ( [ re2 ] ) , and at least a qualitative evaluation of the background level in the @xmath59(@xmath1 , @xmath2 ) reaction to produce @xmath0-mesic nuclei will be possible .    furthermore , the cross section of the double - scattering reaction is sensitive to low - energy @xmath14 interaction ( see fig .  [ fig2a ] ) , because a quasi - elastic scattering of an @xmath0 meson and a proton takes place .",
    "therefore , the differential cross section of the reaction ( [ re1 ] ) may provide independent information on this interaction , which has been investigated by photoproduction and @xmath1-induced reactions .",
    "th experimental setup for this pilot experiment is still under consideration .",
    "if we can use the e15/p28 setup , the detection of only two protons is enough to distinguish the possible final states of @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , by the missing - mass analysis for @xmath51(@xmath30 , @xmath63)@xmath64 .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] is a preliminary result of a monte carlo simulation , taking into account the detector resolution these contributions are well - separated from each other .",
    "the ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) reaction , once investigated by chrien _",
    "et al . _ at bnl , is revisited .",
    "an exclusive measurement with the recoilless condition may enhance a signal from @xmath0-mesic nuclei . before starting such an experiment , a pilot experiment with the @xmath51(@xmath30 , @xmath29 ) is also planned .",
    "it aims to estimate the contributions of the @xmath15 production and irrelevant backgrounds by detecting the @xmath65 and @xmath66 states .",
