    "furthermore , @xmath30 is the local time for the process @xmath22 on @xmath13 , i.e. it is a continuous , non - decreasing process that increases only when @xmath31 such that the lebesgue measure @xmath32 ( eg . see @xcite ) .",

    "owing to the non smoothness of the limiting function , one can not hope to obtain a limit in mean square sense to a standard diffusion process as before .",
    "in particular , as we will see , the non smoothness of the limiting function leads to the effect that the limiting diffusion may have points where the scale function is not differentiable ( skew diffusion ) and also points with positive speed measure ( points with delay ) .    for any @xmath42",

    "hence , we have @xmath419 similarly , it can be shown that ( [ maxminprobalternativestatement1a ] ) holds for @xmath420 as well .    secondly , we observe that if ( [ maxminprobalternativestatement ] ) holds for @xmath421 and @xmath422 then it will hold for any @xmath408 with @xmath409 . indeed ,",
    "we have @xmath423 the last two terms in the right hand side of the inequality above converge to zero as @xmath4 by the discussion above .",
    "hence , it remains to prove that @xmath424 let us choose some @xmath425 such that @xmath426 .",
    "obviously , if the process starts from some point on @xmath427 with @xmath428 $ ] then @xmath429 .",

    "namely , for @xmath432 we have @xmath433 uniformly in @xmath434 .",
    "this implies that the first term on the right hand side of ( [ maxminprobalternativestatement2b1 ] ) can be made arbitrarily small .",
    "we show now how the second term on the right hand side of ( [ maxminprobalternativestatement2b1 ] ) can be made arbitrarily small . for @xmath58",
    "sufficiently small and for @xmath425 much smaller than a small @xmath197 , it can be shown that @xmath435 $ ] and @xmath436 $ ] are arbitrarily close to 1 .",
    "this can be done by an argument similar to the one that was used to prove lemma [ lemma24 ] . similarly",
    "to there , one estimates the difference @xmath437-\\hat{\\mathbb{p}}^{\\epsilon}_{\\kappa_{0}}[\\hat{x}^{\\epsilon}_{\\hat{\\tau}(-\\kappa,\\kappa^{'}_{0})}={\\kappa^{'}_{0}}]|\\ ] ] and uses the corresponding estimate for @xmath438 $ ] for @xmath58 sufficiently small , where @xmath312 is the process defined by ( [ escordprocess ] ) .",
    "one also needs to use lemma [ lemma24 ] .",
    "the treatment of @xmath436 $ ] is almost identical with the obvious changes .",
    "we will not repeat the lengthy , but straightforward calculations here .",
    "hence , the second term on the right hand side of ( [ maxminprobalternativestatement2b1 ] ) can be made arbitrarily small .    using the above we finally get that @xmath439 therefore , we have established that ( [ maxminprobalternativestatement ] ) holds for any @xmath440 .",
    "next , we prove that @xmath441 where @xmath442 , y\\in d^{\\epsilon}_{x}\\rbrace$ ] .",
    "we use again the strong markov property .",
    "let us choose some @xmath26 such that @xmath443 and @xmath444 .",
    "by strong markov property with respect to the exit time from @xmath445 we have : @xmath446 the latter implies that for any @xmath447 : @xmath448 the latter inequality and ( [ maxminprobalternativestatement ] ) imply ( [ maxminprob ] ) .",
    "therefore @xmath406 has approximately the same value for all @xmath449 for @xmath58 small enough .",
    "let us now identify this value .",
    "in order to do this we use the machinery with the invariant measures .",
    "in particular , we consider again the two cycles of markov times @xmath178 and @xmath351 that are defined by ( [ markovtimes3 ] ) .",
    "the numbers @xmath450 and @xmath451 are strictly positive .",

    "can be written as @xmath456 furthermore , we for @xmath134 sufficiently small we have @xmath457 the latter and lemma [ lemma52 ] imply for sufficiently small @xmath134 and sufficiently small @xmath58 that @xmath458 similarly , we have for sufficiently small @xmath134 and sufficiently small @xmath58 that @xmath459 therefore , we finally get for sufficiently small @xmath134 and sufficiently small @xmath58 that @xmath460 \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\kappa-\\kappa_{0}}.\\label{asymptoticsofinvariantmeasures3b}\\ ] ] hence , by equations ( [ maxprobability3])-([asymptoticsofinvariantmeasures3b ] ) we get for sufficiently small @xmath134 and sufficiently small @xmath58 that @xmath461^{-1}}{[u'(0+)]^{-1}+[u'(0-)]^{-1}}|<\\eta\\ ] ] similarly , we can prove that @xmath462 then for @xmath463 we can obtain that @xmath464^{-1}}{[u'(0+)]^{-1}+[u'(0-)]^{-1}}|<\\eta\\ ] ] and that the corresponding relation ( [ maxprobability2 ] ) holds , i.e. @xmath465 for all @xmath26 such that @xmath169\\times d^{\\epsilon}_{x}$ ] for @xmath58 sufficiently small .",
