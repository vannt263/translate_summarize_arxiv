    "in recent years there have been several reported detections of free floating brown dwarfs with planetary masses in very young galactic clusters ( eg .",
    "oasa , tamura & sugitani 1999 ; lucas & roche 2000 ; zapatero osorio et al.2000 ; allers et al.2006 ; jayawardhana & ivanov 2006 ) .",
    "many of these candidates are not yet confirmed as cluster members with the low temperatures predicted by theoretical models .",
    "however , at least 1 confirmed pmo probably has m@xmath4",
    "m@xmath1 : cha 1109 - 7734 ( luhman et al.2005 ) . here",
    "we adopt a planetary mass threshold of 15  m@xmath1 ( 0.014  m@xmath5 ) in order to include sources on the deuterium burning limit , which is at 13 - 14  m@xmath1 for solar abundance ( chabrier et al.2000 ; burrows et al.1997 ) but may be marginally higher in orion , which has a low d / h ratio ( see odell 2004 and references therein ) .",
    "lucas , roche & tamura ( 2005 ) ( hereafter lrt ) detected 33 candidate pmos in a deep imaging survey of the trapezium cluster , and showed that @xmath613% of cluster members have masses in the range 3 - 13  m@xmath1 .",
    "these masses were estimated from source luminosities and an assumed age of 1  myr , using the isochrone of the lyon group . here",
    "we present spectra of a sample of candidates chosen from lrt and lucas & roche ( 2000 ) in an attempt to constrain the inital mass function ( imf ) at planetary masses . in section 2",
    "the observations are described . in section 3",
    "we determine spectral types and surface gravity status and assess cluster membership .",
    "we then compare the results with the predictions of pre - main sequence models and discuss the imf .",
    "near infrared spectra of pmo candidates in orion were obtained in two observing programmes : one with gnirs at gemini south observatory and one in classical mode with niri at gemini north observatory .",
    "the gnirs data were taken in queue mode between november 2004 and november 2005 .",
    "the niri data were obtained in the classical observing mode on 5 - 8 december 2003 .",
    "useful results were obtained for 11 candidate pmos ( see table 1 ) .",
    "all are located in the outer parts of the trapezium cluster where the pervasive nebulosity is relatively faint .",
    "they were selected for low extinction ( @xmath7 mag ) which reduces the chance of observing background stars ( see lrt ) .",
    "the gnirs sample consisted of 7 candidate pmos from lrt .",
    "with niri we observed 5 candidate pmos , 4 selected from lrt and 1 ( 022 - 115 ) from lucas & roche ( 2000 ) .",
    "for one of these 5 candidates , 188 - 658 , the data were of poor quality , so it was reobserved with gnirs .",
    "the gnirs data were taken with a short slit , so only one source could be observed at a time .",
    "slit orientations which minimise the local nebulosity gradient in were chosen .",
    "the long slit of the niri spectrograph was oriented so as to include 2 or 3 sources simultaneously .",
    "hence , an additional selection criterion , for the niri sources only , was a very weak local nebulosity gradient , in order to minimise the effects of the structured background on the extracted spectra . in both programmes",
    "the background emission was subtracted using a 3nod between 2 positions along the slit at intervals of 2 - 4 minutes .",
    "the gnirs data were taken in cross dispersed mode with the 32 lines / mm grating . here",
    "we focus on the data in 2 orders covering the h ( 1.65  @xmath8 m ) and k ( 2.2  @xmath8 m ) bands , where the data quality is best .",
    "slit widths of 0.45 or 0.675 were used , depending on the seeing conditions .",
    "the spectral resolution was r=@xmath9 in the h and k bands with the 0.675 slit and r@xmath101400 with the 0.45 slit .",
    "the niri spectra were taken with a 0.75 slit and the f/6 camera .",
    "the k band grism was used for most observations but the h band grism was used to take some data at relatively high airmass .",
    "the resolution was r@xmath11 for all the niri data .",
    "the data were reduced with the iraf software package .",
    "the oh sky lines were used to wavelength calibrate the gnirs spectra , and argon lamp spectra were used for the niri data . f and",
    "g - type stellar standards were used to calibrate the throughput .",
    "the extracted spectra were cleaned of narrow noise spikes attributable to bad pixels , cosmic rays and time variable telluric oh emission lines , using independent subsets of the data to ensure that genuine features were not discarded .",
    "residual background features caused by 3 to 5 of the brightest hi , h@xmath12 or hei lines ( see marconi et al .",
    "1998 ) were also fitted and subtracted.the independent subsets were then coadded and dereddened with the deredden task in iraf to produce the final results .    *",
    "table 1 - source list and integration times * +    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     source notes : ( 1 ) greater weight was given to the h band indices for 092 - 532 , owing to the poorer quality of the k band spectrum .",
    "( 2 ) the qk value was neglected , since 107 - 453 appears to have a k band excess , judging by the jhk fluxes and the k band continuum profile .",
    "( 3 ) 016 - 430 shows a significant discrepancy between the wk and qk results , probably due to the low signal to noise of the data .",
    "( 4 ) the k band results were given more weight than h band for 183 - 729 , due to the longer integration time .",
    "183 - 729 was found to have low gravity and type m8.75@xmath13 in the optical spectrum of riddick ( 2006 ) .",
    "pmos with the canonical 1  myr age of trapezium cluster members are predicted to have surface gravities 50 to 100 times lower than field dwarfs of similar spectral type , since they have not yet contracted to the stable radius ( r@xmath100.1  r@xmath5 ) that is supported by degeneracy pressure in mature field dwarfs .",
    "the clearest indicator of cluster membership in very young sources is the detection of low surface gravity ( low - g ) features in the optical or infrared spectrum ( eg .",
    "mcgovern et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the most easily detected low - g feature is the triangular profile of the h band pseudo - continuum , which peaks at @xmath14 m in an f@xmath15 plot , identified by lucas et al.(2001 ) ; see also natta et al.(2002 ) , meeus & mccaughrean ( 2005 ) .",
    "this contrasts with the flat topped profile observed in late m and l type high gravity ( high - g ) field dwarfs , a difference attributed by kirkpatrick et al.(2006 ) to less collision induced h@xmath12 absorption in low - g objects .",
    "in addition , the following systematic differences between the pseudo continua of low - g and high - g objects are observed in the k band in the template samples .",
    "( 1 ) f@xmath15 spectra of very young late m type brown dwarfs have a typically quite flat maximum between 2.18 and 2.28  @xmath8 m ( eg .",
    "luhman , peterson & megeath 2004 ) whereas field dwarfs with types m7-l7 all have a maximum between 2.14 - 2.18  @xmath8 m and decline slowly from @xmath16 m .",
    "this decline is more pronounced at mid - late l types .",
    "( 2 ) the co ( v=2 - 0 ) absorption trough located at @xmath17 m is weaker in very young brown dwarfs with types m7-m9.5 than in the field dwarfs with equivalent ( optically determined ) spectral type .",
    "the surface gravity status of the 8 cool orion dwarfs is indicated in table 2 .",
    "for some sources , eg .",
    "152 - 717 and 057 - 247 , the triangular h band profile is obvious from visual inspection .",
    "however , for several candidates the low signal to noise required a statistical test to determine whether the h and k band spectra data are more consistent with low - g template spectra than high - g field dwarf templates . for each candidate reduced @xmath18 values were calculated separately for the smoothed h and k band spectra using young dwarf and field dwarf spectra from the template samples .",
    "best fits were identified by @xmath18 minimisation for a range of spectral types : m4 to m9.5 for the young dwarf templates and m4 to l3 for the field dwarf templates .",
    "the uncertainties in f@xmath15 at each wavelength were estimated using the scatter calculated in narrow wavelength bins and were propagated through to the smoothed spectra .",
    "this will underestimate the errors if there are also systematic effects , e.g. correction for atmospheric absorption .",
    "hence , the absolute values of @xmath18 are difficult to interpret and are not used to derive formal probabilities .",
    "however , relative values can be used to determine whether high - g or low - g templates provide the better fits .",
    "the @xmath18 results show that 4 sources have spectra that are more consistent with low - g late m or early l type templates than high - g templates in the h and/or k bands : 057 - 247 , 152 - 717 , 137 - 532 , and 183 - 729 ( table 2 ) .",
    "low - g status is also probable for 188 - 658 , though the result is less clear . for 107 - 453 ,",
    "the k - band fits are poor owing to an unusually high flux at @xmath19 m .",
    "this may be due to circumstellar dust emission , which would suggest that it is a young object .",
    "the @xmath18 values for the best fits to 016 - 430 and 092 - 532 are not significantly different for the low- and high - gravity templates .",
    "the 3 sources exluded from table 2 are almost certainly field stars , with spectral types @xmath6m5 .",
    "it is instructive to calculate the expected number of high - g field dwarfs within the 26  arcmin@xmath20 area of the lrt survey with similar spectral types and fluxes to the pmo candidates .",
    "the typical absolute magnitudes for single m9 and l5 field dwarfs are m@xmath21=10.29 , 11.61 respectively ( kirkpatrick et al .",
    "2000 ) on the mko system .",
    "hence m9 and l5 field dwarfs would appear fainter than all the sources in table 1 at distances , @xmath22339  pc ( m9 ) or 185  pc ( l5 ) .",
    "spectral types @xmath23l5 were ruled out by the @xmath18 fits .",
    "m9-l5 type field dwarfs have effective temperatures @xmath24  k ( golimowski et al.2004 ) and a space density in the range 0.0067 - 0.0145  pc@xmath25 ( burgasser 2004 ) . multiplying the space density for each sub - type by the appropriate volume and summing the results , an expected contamination of 0.36 - 0.72 m9-l5v single systems was calculated .",
    "this rises to 0.61 - 1.22 objects when unresolved binaries are included , assuming an incidence of 25% ( basri & reiners 2006 ) and equal luminosity for both components . if we conservatively assume a poisson distribution with a mean of 1.22 and neglect candidates which have not yet been observed , the probability that all 6 sources in table 2 with types @xmath0m9 are field dwarfs is 0.2% and the probability that more than 3 are field dwarfs is 3.6% .",
    "when m6-m8 objects are included , the expected number of contaminating objects rises by a factor of @xmath26 , so it is quite possible that 1 or 2 of the sources whose gravity status is uncertain are field dwarfs .",
    "( 100,170 ) ( 0,0 )    we estimate the masses of the cluster members by comparison with the model isochrones of chabrier et al.(2000 ) .",
    "the masses can be derived from the isochrone using ( i ) luminosity and assumed age ( see lrt ) , or ( ii ) temperature and assumed age . in theory ,",
    "both mass and age can be derived from luminosity and temperature using the hr diagram but this method is too temperature sensitive at 2000 - 2500  k to produce useful results .",
    "if an age of 1  myr is assumed , method ( i ) gives masses m@xmath27  m@xmath1 in every case .",
    "spectral types @xmath0m9 correspond to t@xmath28  k , using the temperature scale of luhman et al.(2003 ) that has been extensively applied in star formation regions . at 1 myr , method ( ii ) then indicates m@xmath29  m@xmath1 . hence the luminosities and temperatures agree with expectations for pmos with an age of @xmath30myr . if an age of 10 myr is assumed then the masses derived from method ( i ) increase somewhat , as shown in fig.2 . however , m@xmath31",
    "m@xmath1 in every case , and we find m@xmath32 for the confirmed cluster member 057 - 257 and the likely cluster members 188 - 658 and 016 - 430 . for method ( ii )",
    "a 10  myr age also gives m@xmath31  m@xmath1 for the 6 sources with spectral types @xmath0m9 . since the cluster appears to contain fewer pmos than more massive brown dwarfs ( see lrt ) any age spread in the cluster would be expected to bias our luminosity selected sample towards larger ages than the cluster average .",
    "most researches have shown that the great majority of stellar and substellar cluster members have ages less than a few myr(riddick 2006 ; lucas et al.2001 ; hillenbrand 1997 ; lada et al.2004 ) however , some studies suggest a broader age spread .",
    "palla et al.(2005 ) detected lithium depletion in some low mass stars and proposed that star formation began in the cluster at a low rate @xmath33myr ago and accelerated toward the present day .      since 10  myr ages are possible for the pmo candidates , it is not yet proven that any have mass m@xmath34 . however , even at age 10  myr at least 1 source is confirmed with m@xmath35 , along with 2 other likely cluster members .",
    "the model isochrones also become highly uncertain at ages less than a few myr ( baraffe et al.2002 ) .",
    "however recent dynamical mass measurements of an eclipsing binary brown dwarf in the trapezium cluster agree well with the predictions of the 1  myr isochrone ( stassun , mathieu & valenti 2006 ) and less direct mass estimates based on surface gravities ( mohanty et al.2004 ) are also fairly consistent with the predictions for very young brown dwarfs .",
    "hence , at present the evidence suggests the model isochrones yield approximately correct masses at ages as low as 1  myr .",
    "this dataset therefore adds significantly to the evidence that free floating pmos exist in very young clusters , extending the results of lucas et al.(2001 ) to lower luminosities . in a sample of 11 pmo candidates we have 4",
    "confirmed cluster members , 1 very probable member , 3 sources with uncertain status , and 3 field stars .",
    "assuming an age of 1  myr , lrt found that pmo candidates with m=3 - 13  m@xmath1 number 13.2% of the population . considering only the 7 sources",
    "whose status is clear , and assuming a 1  myr age and poisson statistics , a number fraction of confirmed pmos of @xmath36 is simplistically derived .",
    "however , @xmath3750% of the candidates of lrt lay in the 3 - 5  m@xmath1 mass bin , which is under - represented in this sample ( see fig.2 ) but may contain a higher fraction of field stars .",
    "in addition , since the bias towards ages @xmath38myr at very low luminosities is not quantified , the number fraction of pmos can only be loosely constrained .",
    "however , we can say that the pmo number fraction in the range 3 - 15  m@xmath1 is almost certainly between 1% and 14% , and the fraction with m@xmath2m@xmath1 is @xmath235% .",
    "we thank kevin luhman for supplying the template spectra used to calibrate the orion spectra .",
    "this paper is based on observations obtained in programmes gs-2004b - q-11 and gn-2003b - c-1 at the gemini observatory , which is operated by the association of universities for research is astronomy , inc .",
