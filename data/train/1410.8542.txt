    "note that schottky semigroups @xmath63 , @xmath75 are very rarely topologically conjugate on all of @xmath65 ; for , they are invertible on @xmath65 , and therefore any conjugacy would extend to a conjugacy between the _ groups _ they generate .",

    "it is an easy calculus exercise to show the lemma if @xmath1211 approaches @xmath469 vertically , i.e. if @xmath154 is fixed at @xmath977 .",
    "however , we desire convergence in general , so we will need to look at power series .",
    "write @xmath1212 as the power series @xmath1213 .",
    "then @xmath1214 the terms which contribute to the imaginary part of this sum are exactly those for which @xmath551 is odd .",
    "hence @xmath1215 the top limit on the inner sum indicates that we should run the inner sum until @xmath1216 is larger than @xmath881 .",
    "also note we are recording the imaginary part of @xmath1217 , so the @xmath1218 terms have disappeared .",
    "therefore , @xmath1219 the entire sum is controlled in absolute value by @xmath1220 , which is uniformly convergent for @xmath1221 . therefore ,",
    "as @xmath1222 , the entire sum converges , at a rate controlled independently of @xmath160 , to @xmath1223 .",
    "the point in @xmath1210 associated with @xmath160 has coordinates @xmath1224 in @xmath1073 , and the point in the vertically scaled copy of @xmath1208 has coordinates @xmath1225 , and the lemma follows .",
    "if affine traps are dense in @xmath1088 , then near any point in @xmath1088 , by lemma  [ lemma:2difs_is_limit_of_nonreal ] there are nonreal parameters which have a trap and therefore lie in the interior of @xmath0 .",
    "so every point in @xmath1088 would be in the closure of the interior of @xmath0 ; i.e. conjecture  [ conjecture : omega_2_interior ] implies @xmath1226 .",
    "@xmath21 is path connected @xcite , but bousch s proof is somewhat indirect .",
    "his strategy is to show that every point can be joined by a path to some parameter with absolute value close to @xmath19 . since @xmath21 contains an annulus around the unit circle , this gives path connectedness .",
    "he does not directly address what the paths in @xmath21 actually look like , or when a ( polygonal ) path near @xmath21 can be approximated by a path contained in @xmath21 .    in this section ,",
    "we show how to certify the existence of a point in @xmath21 in a neighborhood of a given point and how to certify a path in @xmath21 in a neighborhood of a given polygonal path .",
    "if we can certify paths , we can certify loops , and thus exotic holes in @xmath21 . as with @xmath0 , by a _ hole _ in @xmath21 , we mean a connected component of the complement which is distinct from the connected component of the complement which contains @xmath17 .",
    "just as @xmath0 closely resembles the limit set @xmath42 at many points , @xmath21 closely resembles @xmath10 .",
    "thus the methods in this section are closely related to the methods we developed in section  [ subsection : lz_paths ] to construct paths in @xmath10 ( e.g. proposition  [ proposition : path_in_lambda ] ) .      in this section ,",
    "we prove a lemma in complex analysis , but we first motivate it .",
    "suppose we have a holomorphic function @xmath1227 , and we find that @xmath1228 is quite close to a value we desire @xmath137 .",
    "we would like to conclude that there is a @xmath696 near @xmath688 so that @xmath1229 .",
    "if the derivative of @xmath1230 is bounded away from @xmath17 , and does not vary much near @xmath688 , then @xmath1230 can be well approximated by a linear function , and @xmath696 can be found .    thus to certify the existence of such a @xmath696 , and to prove the validity of the certificate , is not technically difficult .",
    "however , lemma  [ lemma : nearby_root ] is organized carefully to be of use to us later , and it can be confusing to read .",
    "one should understand the lemma as saying `` if there are four constants @xmath1231 which satisfy the hypotheses , then the conclusion holds '' . do not worry about where the constants come from at this stage .",
    "this lemma is very similar to lemma  3.1 in @xcite .",
    "[ lemma : nearby_root ] let @xmath1230 be a holomorphic function and @xmath1232 with @xmath1233 .",

    "if @xmath1247 , the image circle will enclose @xmath17 , and hence @xmath1248 , or equivalently @xmath1244 will have a zero within @xmath1249 , the ball of radius @xmath203 centered at @xmath688 .",
    "now consider @xmath1230 ; it might not be affine , and we record the remainder term as @xmath1250 : @xmath1251 suppose that there were a radius @xmath203 such that for all @xmath1252 , we had @xmath1253 .",
    "in other words , the error in the affine approximation is smaller than the radius of the affine image circle minus @xmath384 .",
    "then the image of the circle @xmath1245 under @xmath1230 would have to contain @xmath1254 , and hence @xmath1230 would have a zero in @xmath1249 . additionally , this follows immediately from rouche s theorem , which also gives the claimed uniqueness .    to prove the lemma , then , it suffices to find a @xmath203 such that @xmath1255 for all @xmath1252 . from taylor",

    "rearranging the inequality in the hypothesis of the lemma , we have @xmath1261 since @xmath1262 , and plugging in @xmath1260 , we have @xmath1263 therefore , @xmath1264 satisfies the necessary inequality , so there is @xmath1265 with @xmath1229 . since making @xmath490 smaller maintains the validity of the bounds @xmath1266 for @xmath1267 , we may shrink @xmath490 until the inequality in the lemma is an equality , so the claimed bound on @xmath1268 holds .",
    "the hypotheses of lemma  [ lemma : nearby_root ] may seem somewhat technical , but in fact they are not difficult to check in practice .",
    "we set @xmath490 to be quite small but still large compared to @xmath384 , and we get bounds on the derivative",
    ". then @xmath355 can be found by trial and error or any minimum - finding algorithm .",
    "in fact , mathematica produces an explicit formula for the @xmath355 which minimizes the expression on the right of the inequality for @xmath490 ; this formula is rather large and unedifying , so we omit it .",
    "one feature we will make use of is that lemma  [ lemma : nearby_root ] can be checked for large collections of elements in @xmath169 at the same time , since two words with a large common prefix will satisfy the same @xmath1266 bounds with similar values of @xmath384 .",
    "lemma  [ lemma : nearby_root ] requires good derivative bounds on @xmath1269 a given ball @xmath1270 . a naive way to approach",
    "this is to get a universal upper bound @xmath318 on the second derivative and then state that @xmath1271 on @xmath1270 .",
    "this is typically a bad estimate because @xmath490 can be large compared to the potential change in @xmath1269 .",
    "here is a better way .",
    "since @xmath1267 is holomorphic , its maximum will lie on the boundary of @xmath1270 .",
    "cover the boundary circle of @xmath1270 with many ( say , @xmath1272 ) small balls , use the naive approach on these small balls , and take the maximum . because the radius on which we apply the naive approach is now quite small",
    ", our error will be much less .",
    "we now give some initial observations about paths in @xmath21 to clarify the construction to follow . to each point @xmath1 in @xmath21 , there is a set of distinguished words in @xmath169 ; namely , the words @xmath154 such that @xmath1273 .",
    "therefore , if we have a path @xmath1274 \\to \\d^*$ ] such that the image of @xmath74 lies in @xmath21 , there is a combinatorial map @xmath1275 \\to \\partial \\sigma$ ] such that @xmath1276 .",
    "of course , @xmath135 is not uniquely defined , as there may be more than one word mapping to @xmath20 for a given parameter .    in order to build paths in @xmath21 ,",
    "we essentially go in the other direction , given two words @xmath452 , we first build a nice combinatorial path interpolating between @xmath469 and @xmath977 .",
    "then , provided we are close enough to @xmath21 , we show how apply lemma  [ lemma : nearby_root ] to produce a path of parameters which drags this combinatorial path along @xmath20 .",

    "consequently , there is a map @xmath1291 such that @xmath1290 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath811 is uniformly continuous and the image @xmath1292 is path connected .",
    "that the map @xmath811 exists and is well - defined ( single - valued ) follows immediately from lemma  [ lemma : nearby_root ] , so the content of the lemma is the uniform continuity and path connectedness . we first address the former .",
    "this is with respect to the cantor metric , so it suffices to show that if two words @xmath1293 have a sufficiently long common prefix , then their images under @xmath811 are close ( independent of what the prefix is ) .",
    "let @xmath318 be equal to @xmath1294 .",
    "we claim that there exists a constant @xmath628 such that if @xmath1293 have a common prefix @xmath229 of length at least @xmath628 , then @xmath1295 we now prove this claim .",
    "we remark that @xmath160 is a prefix of @xmath229 , since @xmath1296 already have the common prefix @xmath160 . by lemma  [ lemma : diameter_bound ] , for a given @xmath1 , the limit set @xmath10 is contained in a ball of radius @xmath1297 centered at @xmath20 , so if @xmath160 is a word of length @xmath51 , then @xmath973 is contained in a ball of size @xmath1298 centered at @xmath434 . in our situation , then , the limit set @xmath1299 is contained inside a ball of radius @xmath1300 .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath1301 we are going to apply lemma  [ lemma : nearby_root ] to @xmath1302 and @xmath1303 to get nearby roots , but there is a slight subtlety .",
    "we have derivative bounds on all words in @xmath1304 and @xmath1305 , but to apply lemma  [ lemma : nearby_root ] , we need derivative bounds in a ball centered at @xmath1306 .",
    "we can achieve these bounds in the following way . since @xmath1307 , the derivative bounds @xmath49 and @xmath748 must be valid over @xmath1308 .",
    "so if @xmath1309 for @xmath628 sufficiently long enough , then @xmath1310 so we can apply lemma  [ lemma : nearby_root ] to the words @xmath1296 at the point @xmath1306 with radius @xmath1311 and @xmath1312 ; this gives nearby @xmath1313 so @xmath1314 and @xmath1315 .",

    "it remains to show that the image @xmath1292 is path connected .",
    "analogous to the set @xmath488 we constructed to build paths through @xmath10 in section  [ section : topology_of_lambda ] , given any two words @xmath1319 , we will construct a combinatorial path through @xmath1304 interpolating between them , and then show that applying @xmath811 to this path gives a continuous path in @xmath21 .",
    "given a finite word @xmath229 , denote by @xmath1320 the word obtained from @xmath229 by swapping @xmath16 and @xmath18 .",

    "furthermore , we ll show that the images encircle a point which is not in @xmath21 .",
    "this will complete the proof of the existence of a hole in @xmath21 .",
