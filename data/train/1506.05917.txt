    "recent observations suggest that supermassive black holes ( smbh ) reside in the centers of most massive galaxies . in the nearby universe a variety of host galaxy properties are known to be correlated with the central smbh mass .",
    "for instance there is a tight correlation between the smbh mass and the bulge luminosity , the bulge mass , and the central velocity dispersion .",
    "these empirical correlations suggest that black holes ( bhs ) may play a key role in the growth and evolution of galaxies .",
    "recent studies , however , reveal that the correlation between the smbh mass and bulge / host galaxy properties are more complex than originally thought . for instance @xcite showed that the best - fit @xmath5 relation differs between early- and late - type galaxies .",
    "the difference results in the smbh mass to be two times larger at a given velocity dispersion for the early - type @xmath5 relation than for the late - type systems .",
    "in contrast , there does not seem to be a correlation between galaxies hosting psuedo - bulges and their smbh masses .",
    "much of the uncertainty comes from the scarce number of measurements of the smbh masses especially in late - type galaxies , which is especially difficult with current methods for measuring the smbh mass .",
    "the most reliable way to estimate smbh mass is to use dynamics / kinematics of gas or stars near the smbh in a galaxy .",
    "so far , smbh masses have been measured in the following ways : using proper motion of stars around the smbh ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , using proper motion and dynamics of megamasers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , stellar dynamics ( usually only for elliptical or lenticular galaxies ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and ionized gas dynamics .",
    "the method using the proper motion of stars around the central smbh is the simplest of the four , but spatially resolving stars around a smbh , besides the one in our galaxy , is not currently possible .",
    "the smbh mass measurements in galaxies using megamasers , which are rare and difficult to find , requires observations with very high angular resolution ( @xmath6 0.3 milliarcsecond , for example , in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , accomplished with very long baseline interferometer .",
    "stellar dynamics have been used to measure the largest number of smbh masses at this point .",
    "an orbit superposition model @xcite is fit to spectroscopic observations and the method is primarily restricted to elliptical and lenticular systems .",
    "the errors in this method can be amplified when a mass profile is asymmetric .",
    "ionized gas dynamics can be observed in larger samples ( at least compared to the use of stellar or maser dynamics ) , by taking spectra of a galaxy using multiple slits or integral field units ( ifus ) .",
    "the weak point of this method is that ionized gas is not necessarily settled into a pure rotating disk because it is more easily affected by non - circular motion from turbulence , shocks , radiation pressure , outflows , etc .",
    "inferring the velocity field from slit observations is also problematic because such measurements may not always show non - circular motions which could be affecting the gas dynamics .",
    "note that recent integral field unit ( ifu ) observations can avoid this problem and are improving to be very useful to obtain velocity fields .",
    "deriving smbh mass from molecular gas dynamics was not accomplished until @xcite because millimeter - wavelength interferometers did not have sufficient angular resolution and sensitivity to map out the precise kinematics of molecular gas around a black hole .",
    "the smbh mass in the central region of ngc 4526 was measured using the observed co emission line from its circumnuclear , molecular - gas disk @xcite .",
    "this method was also proposed by @xcite .",
    "this technique is similar to the one used for ionized gas dynamics except that a molecular gas velocity field , which is primarily observed at millimeter / submillimeter wavelengths with interferometers , can provide very high spectral resolution with full two - dimensional kinematics compared to optical or near - ir observations .",
    "another major strength for molecular gas observations is that they can be utilized across the hubble sequence from early- to late - type galaxies , as long as there is molecular gas in the galaxy centers .",
    "thus molecular gas observations with new facilities like _ atacamma large millimeter / submillimeter array _ ( alma ) offer a new and promising avenue for increasing smbh measurements .",
    "a figure of merit for this method is summarized by @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we use the method initially employed by @xcite and extend it to measure the smbh mass using the alma data for ( project code = 2011.0.00108.s ; pi = k. kohno ) .",

    "while we determine the smbh mass and the i - band m / l ratio from the molecular gas dynamics , there are some uncertainties coming from the assumption we made when calculating the model .",

    "we estimate the expected stellar mass profile by excluding the bright agn profile and luminosity enhancement by the starburst ring ( section  [ subsec : model_lumdis ] ) , but we could not avoid the dust extinction effects , which could be important for this starburst galaxy with its prominent dust lane around the starburst ring .",
    "one way to mitigate the dust extinction effects is to observe at longer wavelengths such as the near infrared .",
    "nicmos on _ hst _ has a narrow band filter f190n which observes at 1.9 microns .",

    "this comparison already shows that the difference between the two luminosity profiles is negligible .",
    "we also examine the s4 g data at 3.6 microns to compare the stellar profile with the _ hst _ data but the _ spitzer _ infrared array camera ( irac ) psf is too large ( @xmath68 ) to do any detailed comparison .",
    "we normalize the peak luminosity at 1.9 microns to the i - band peak , and then subtract the luminosity enhancement of the agn , as described in section  [ subsec : model_lumdis ] .",
    "we also ignore the starburst region and use the same m / l ratio to calculate the velocity field for the two stellar mass profiles .",
    "we find that a @xmath69 and m / l@xmath57 gives the best - fit value for an inclination of @xmath2 .",
    "the pvds calculated as such are shown in figure  [ fig : kbandvelfield ] .",
    "black and gray contours in figure  [ fig : kbandvelfield ] are the pvd calculated from two stellar mass profile models ",
    "these do not differ much between the two luminosity profiles .",
    "we therefore conclude that the dust extinction effect with the f814w filter is not too serious for the measurement of the smbh mass .",
    "we discuss briefly on the difference coming from how we set the inclination angle .",
    "the accuracy of the inclination angle is critical for calculating the velocity and therefore crucial for the smbh mass estimation .",
    "it is however not straightforward to determine the inclination angle when comparing observations at different field of view .",
    "previous studies of ngc 1097 have determined a dynamical inclination angle of @xmath70 ( hi observations at 3 kiloparsec scales , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or @xmath71 ( h@xmath72 line profile study , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite reported that the inclination angle of ngc 1097 is @xmath73 using the kinematic parameters of @xmath74 observed with submillimeter array ( _ sma _ ) .",
    "they argue that the circumnuclear ring is nearly circular for the inclination of @xmath75 , by which means the ring has an intrinsic elliptical shape in the galactic plane , of which case is not symmetric to the axis .",
    "though the suggested asymmetry is interesting to note , we would like to leave it as a further discussion , since in this work we assume an axisymmetric distribution for stars and molecular gas when calculating the circular velocity field .",
    "this time we assume the galaxy inclination angle to be @xmath76 by referring to @xcite and the axis ratio of the hst i - band observation .",
    "we evaluate the smbh mass to be @xmath65 and the the i - band m / l ratio to be @xmath4 at the inclination angle of @xmath2 , with the chi - square value of 113 ( 1.09 when divided with the degree of freedom 104 ) .",
    "we also follow the same process in section  [ sec : model ] with the inclination angle of @xmath77 and evaluate the smbh mass to be @xmath78 and the i - band m / l ratio to be @xmath79 with the chi - square value of 117 ( 1.13 when reduced with the degree of freedom ) .",
    "see also dashed curves in figure  [ fig : errbars ] for the chi - square distribution , used to determine the error bar for each parameter .",
    "we can also consider the case of the inclination angle is @xmath80 by multiplying a factor of @xmath81 to the velocity where we write @xmath82 as an inclination angle of the observed component . under the simplified assumption that the smbh mass is proportional to the square of the velocity , we can estimate the change of the smbh mass to be smaller than @xmath83 , which is mostly included in the error bar of our result @xmath84 .",
    "we therefore consider that it is not crucial to count this error into our error budget .",
    "note that , however , this galaxy could have a warped or a misaligned structure , which could be interesting to investigate but requires a calculation for an asymmetric potential field .",
    "our main result is obtained using the hcn line because it had the highest signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "it is important to measure the smbh mass from other molecular species as well for consistency .",
    "we therefore repeat our method using the @xmath85 emission line .",
    "we apply the fitting procedure described in section  [ subsec : model_fit ] to the pvd for @xmath86 , and estimate the smbh mass to be @xmath87 and the i - band m / l ratio to be @xmath88 with a galaxy inclination of @xmath2 .",
    "these derived values are consistent with the measurement using @xmath0 . from figure",
    "[ fig : pvdhcnhco ] , we see that the observed pvds of two molecular gases are in good agreement , indicating that the fitting parameters will be consistent between the two .",
    "reaching the velocity structure from multiple molecular species is one of the particular benefit of the smbh mass measurement with millimeter / submillimeter wavelength observation , which enable one to observe more than two molecular species at the same frequency band .",
    "we derive the smbh mass in ngc 1097 to be @xmath84 by using dense molecular gas dynamics traced with @xmath0 and @xmath89 observed with alma .",
    "the value of smbh mass is measured with two emission lines is in good agreement , indicating the applicability of this method to any nearby galaxy with detectable molecular gas .",
    "furthermore , the mass is consistent with @xmath5 relation @xcite from the velocity dispersion observed by @xcite .",
    "we can comment that the derived mass does not coincide with the @xmath5 relation for early - type galaxies , but for mixed samples and for late - type galaxies .",
    "this time we consider that the dust extinction effect is not very crucial to model the luminosity distribution of the galaxy , but the inclination angle could affect the smbh mass when we observe the rotational motion with better resolution . as millimeter",
    "/ submillimeter interferometers develop their angular resolution and sensitivity , this method will provide more samples , especially late - type galaxies with their central gas dynamically well relaxed , to correlations between smbh mass and galaxy properties such as @xmath5 relation .",

    "<S> we present an estimate of the mass of the supermassive black hole ( smbh ) in the nearby type-1 seyfert galaxy using atacamma large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) observations of dense gas kinematics . </S>",
    "<S> dense molecular gas dynamics are traced with @xmath0 and @xmath1 emission lines . assuming a host galaxy inclination of @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> , we derive a smbh mass , @xmath3 , and an i - band mass to light ratio to be @xmath4 , using @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the estimated parameters are consistent between the two emission lines . </S>",
    "<S> the measured smbh mass is in good agreement with the smbh mass and bulge velocity dispersion relationship . </S>",
    "<S> our result showcases alma s potential for deriving accurate smbh masses , especially for nearby late - type galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> larger samples and accurate smbh masses will further elucidate the relationship between the black hole ( bh ) and host galaxy properties and constrain the coevolutionary growth of galaxies and bhs . </S>"
