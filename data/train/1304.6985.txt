    "a remarkable consequence is that a theory of integration along @xmath1 can be established in the sense of riemannstieltjes , which leads to a theory of differential equations driven by @xmath14 such a theory for paths with bounded variation is classical and well - studied .",

    "the fundamental reason is that the path @xmath1 itself",
    "does not reveal enough information on its differential @xmath13 , which is essential to be fully understood if we want to develop an integration theory along @xmath14 as pointed out by t. lyons in @xcite , for this purpose , together with the path itself , a finite sequence of iterated integrals up to level @xmath17 $ ] satisfying chen s identity should be specified in advance . such a finite sequence of iterated integrals @xmath18})\\ ] ] is regarded as a multiplicative functional @xmath19 from the simplex @xmath20 to the truncated tensor algebra @xmath21)}(\\mathbb{r}^{d})=\\oplus_{n=0}^{[p]}\\mathbb{r}^{nd}.\\ ] ] @xmath19 is called a rough path with roughness @xmath22 according to @xcite , @xmath19 extends uniquely to a multiplicative functional from @xmath23 to @xmath24 in the founding work of t. lyons in @xcite , a general theory of integration and differential equations for rough paths was established .    for a rough path @xmath19 with roughness",

    "chen in @xcite and t. lyons in @xcite , can be regarded as the collection of overall information of any arbitrary level @xmath29 about the rough path @xmath30 it is of central interest and conjectured in the theory of rough paths that the signature @xmath28 contains sufficient information to recover the path @xmath19 completely . in the groundbreaking paper @xcite by b. hambly and t. lyons",
    ", they proved that for a path @xmath1 with bounded variation , the signature of @xmath1 uniquely determines the path up to a tree - like equivalence .",
    "however , for paths with unbounded variation , very few results are available and it remains a lot of work to do .    in the work @xcite by y. le jan and z. qian ,",
    "they considered the case of multidimensional brownian motion and proved that for almost surely , the brownian paths can be recovered by using the so - called stratonovich s signature , which is defined via iterated stratonovich s integrals of arbitrary orders . since the brownian paths are of unbounded variation and can be regarded as rough paths with roughness @xmath31",
    ", we may need to specify the second level in order to make sense in terms of rough paths .",
    "however , according to @xcite , @xcite , there is a canonical lifting of the brownian paths to the second level by using dyadic approximations , which is called the l@xmath32vy s stochastic area process and it coincides exactly with the iterated stratonovich s integral defined in the same way as ( [ iterated integrals ] ) .",
    "such lifting is determined by the brownian paths itself , and in @xcite when regarding the brownian motion as rough paths such lifting was used by the authors .",
    "therefore , the recovery of brownian motion as rough paths is essentially the recovery of the brownian paths in terms of stratonovich s signature .    in the present paper",
    ", we are going to generalize the result of y. le jan and z. qian in @xcite to the case of multidimensional diffusion processes ( possibly degenerate ) .",
    "the main idea of the proof is similar to the case of brownian motion , in which the authors used a specially designed approximation scheme and chose special differential 1-forms to define the so - called extended stratonovich s signatures to recover the brownian paths .",
    "however , there are several difficulties in the case of diffusion processes .",
    "firstly , we need quantitative estimates for rare events of diffusion processes to prove a convergence result similar to the case of brownian motion . in @xcite , the authors used the symmetry and explicit distribution of brownian motion , which are not available in the case of diffusion processes and hence we need to proceed in a different way . secondly , to construct special differential @xmath33-forms , a quite special case of h@xmath34rmander s theorem was used to ensure the existence of density , in which the so - called h@xmath34rmander s condition was easily verified . in the case of diffusion processes ,",
    "the construction of differential @xmath33-forms is more complicated to ensure similar kind of hypoellipticity .",
    "lastly , in the brownian motion case , the laplace operator is well - posed so that pde methods could be applied to obtain a crucial estimate which enables us to relate the extended stratonovich s signatures to the brownian paths . however , for a general diffusion process , the generator @xmath35 may not be well - posed any more ( we do nt impose uniform ellipticity assumption on @xmath35 ) and pde methods may no longer apply ( in fact , to ensure the application of pde methods , rather technical assumptions should be imposed on the differential operator @xmath35 and the domain if without uniform ellipticity ) . therefore , we need a different approach to recover the diffusion paths by using extended stratonovich s signatures .",

    "is that when given @xmath80 we actually think of @xmath73 as a piecewise linear graph by connecting the points in @xmath73 by line segments in order .",
    "here we should point out that the order of points in @xmath73 is rather important , and no parametrizations are involved .",
    "for @xmath81 a _ parametrization _ @xmath69 of order @xmath29 is a partition of the time interval @xmath0 $ ] into @xmath82 nontrivial subintervals : @xmath83 the space of all parametrizations of order @xmath29 will be denoted by @xmath84    let @xmath73 be a p.l.t . in @xmath74 and",

    "[ thm 2.1]let @xmath90 be the space of p.l.t.s in @xmath91 equipped with the discrete @xmath69-algebra .",

    "@xmath96    before proving our main result theorem [ thm 2.1 ] in the next section ,",
    "we first illustrate the idea and main steps of the proof .",
    "we adopt the scheme and the key observation that the diffusion paths can be recovered by reading out the maximal sequence of well - chosen compactly supported differential @xmath33-forms such that the iterated stratonovich s integral of those @xmath33-forms ( extended stratonovich s signature ) along the diffusion paths over the duration of visiting their supports is nonzero , which were proposed in @xcite .",
    "the idea of the proof of theorem [ thm 2.1 ] is the following .",
    "firstly , decompose the euclidean space @xmath74 into disjoint small boxes and narrow tunnels . by recording the successive visit times of those small boxes",
    ", we can construct a piecewise linear approximation of the diffusion paths .",
    "a convergence theorem can be proved by developing certain types of estimates of rare events for the diffusion process . by enlarging the size of those small boxes a little bit ( by a higher order infinitesimal relative to the size of boxes )",
    ", we can similarly get another piecewise linear approximation also converging to the diffusion paths as the size of boxes goes to zero . secondly",
    ", we construct a family of `` special '' differential 1-forms on @xmath74 ( depending on the size of boxes ) in a way that for any larger box , we construct a @xmath33-form supported in it such that it is highly non - degenerate on the inner smaller box .",
    "the crucial observation is that the stratonovich s integral of any of those @xmath33-forms along the diffusion paths over the duration of visit of its support is nonzero .",
    "it turns out that for a diffusion path , we can read out an associated unique maximal finite sequence of @xmath33-forms ( a p.l.t . ) recording a sequence of boxes in order such that the iterated stratonovich s integral of this sequence of @xmath33-forms ( extended stratonovich s signature ) along the diffusion path over the duration of visiting their supports is nonzero .",
    "it provides us with sufficient information to recover the diffusion path by taking limit in a reasonable way .",
    "this is due to the fact that based on our construction , we can prove that such a maximal sequence always `` lies '' between the two piecewise linear approximations constructed before , both of which converge to the diffusion path .",
    "here we need to develop a kind of squeeze theorem for the type of convergence ( convergence in trajectory in the setting of p.l.t.s defined as before ) in our situation .",
    "to carry out the above idea , we are going to establish the following three steps .",
    "\\(1 ) step one : proving a convergence result for the piecewise linear approximation based on successive visit times of small boxes .",
    "the proof consists of two ingredients .",
    "the first one is a probabilistic estimate of the number of boxes visited over the time duration @xmath0,$ ] which can be developed by using a random time change technique .",
    "it turns out that we can reduce to the brownian motion case .",
    "the importance of such an estimate is that we can get an asymptotic rate of the probability that the number of boxes visited over @xmath0 $ ] is quite large .",
    "the second one is the probabilistic estimate of the uniform distance between the piecewise linear approximation path and the original diffusion path , provided the number of boxes visited over @xmath0 $ ] is fixed .",
    "this can be done by using the strong markov property and a quantitative result in @xcite by g. ben arous , s. kusuoka and d.w .",
    "stroock , which gives us control on the density of the poisson kernel of a given bounded domain in @xmath74 and enables us to estimate the probability that the diffusion process travels through narrow tunnels . combining the two ingredients , it is not hard to prove the convergence result by using the borel - cantelli s lemma via a subsequence .",
    "\\(2 ) step two : constructing special differential @xmath33-forms and using extended stratonovich s signatures .",
    "for any larger box , we are going to construct a suitable differential @xmath33-form supported in it and highly nondegenerate on the inner smaller box .",
    "the construction of such a differential @xmath33-form can be reduced to the construction of a differential @xmath33-form such that the generator of some associated sde with dimension @xmath97 is hypoelliptic on the support of the differential @xmath33-form .",
    "the family of diffenrential @xmath33-forms constructed in such a way will be used to construct extended stratonovich s signatures , which in turn will be used to recover the diffusion paths as stated in the idea of the proof .",
    "\\(3 ) step three : proving a squeeze theorem for convergence in trajectory to recover the diffusion paths .    from the above two steps we constructed two sequences of piecewise linear approximations of the diffusion paths , and between which a sequence of p.l.t.s in terms of extended stratonovich signatures . we will formulate the term `` lying between '' in a rigorous way in the setting of p.l.t.s and prove a squeeze theorem for convergence in trajectory which fits our situation . here the squeeze theorem we are going to prove is not in the most general case ( we need to make use of special parametrizations ) , so we need to modify the piecewise linear approximation associated to larger boxes to fit our case .",
    "an advantage of using such a squeeze theorem is that we can get around the estimates based on potential theory and partial differential equations , which was used in @xcite for the laplace operator .",
    "in fact , for a general elliptic operator @xmath98 the associated partial differential equation may not be well - posed and the conditions to ensure a ( regular ) probabilistic representation of a solution is quite restrictive and technical .",
    "in this section , we will give the detailed proof of our main result theorem [ thm 2.1 ] .",
    "recall that @xmath99 is an @xmath40-dimensional diffusion process defined by the following sde : @xmath100 with @xmath101 in which the generating vector fields satisfy assumptions ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) .    in the following the coordinates of @xmath53",
    "is taken with respect to the orthonormal basis given in assumption ( c ) .",
    "similar to the idea of y. le jan and z. qian , we first construct a suitable approximation scheme for the diffusion paths .    for convenience ,",
    "a constant is called universal if it depends only on the generator @xmath35 and the dimensions @xmath102 moreover , sometimes we may use the same notation to denote universal constants coming out from estimates , although they may be different from line to line .",

    "we assume that the boundary of @xmath105 is smoothed to the order of @xmath108 .",
    "such a smoothing procedure can be done in a simple geometric way , or by using standard mollifiers . in the case of",
    "@xmath109 we can simply replace each corner of @xmath105 by a quarter of a circle with radius @xmath108 .",
    "the space @xmath74 is then divided into disjoint small boxes and narrow tunnels .",
