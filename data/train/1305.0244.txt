    "the x(3872 ) state was first detected in august 2003 by belle @xcite in @xmath2 , and its existence was quickly confirmed by the cdf @xcite , d0 @xcite and babar @xcite collaborations .",
    "the observation of the x(3872 ) and other new states with masses in the range 3.84.7  gev has led to a resurgence of interest in exotic meson spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "recently the lhcb collaboration has measured the x(3872 ) mass as @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the pdg summary table has listed the x(3872 ) with an average mass @xmath4 and a narrow width @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the radiative decay @xmath6 @xcite implies the c - parity of the x(3872 ) is even .",
    "the lhcb collaboration has recently provided evidence to preclude @xmath7 from the @xmath8 and @xmath9 assignments @xcite ( ref .",
    "@xcite is another recent work supporting @xmath0 ) .    with strong evidence supporting the @xmath8 quantum numbers , the x(3872 )",
    "does not appear to be a pure conventional charmonium state because the mass of @xmath8 @xmath10 from the quark model calculation is too large .",
    "the @xmath8 assignment of the x(3872 ) , due to its exotic interpretation , has attracted a lot of attention . to date , many structures for the x(3872 ) have been proposed , such as a tetraquark state @xcite , @xmath11 hybrid state @xcite , charmonium @xcite and a @xmath12 molecule state @xcite ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for comprehensive reviews ) .",
    "the @xmath1 molecule picture was developed before the experimental observation , so it attracted considerable attention , but the molecular scenario is hard to reconcile with the large radiative @xmath13 decay rate because the loosely bound @xmath1 is unlikely to annihilate into @xmath13 .",
    "the tetraquark or hybrid scenarios may explain the decay rate puzzle .",
    "but the expected mass of the pure axial - vector charmonium hybrid is about 5  gev @xcite , well above the x(3872 ) .",
    "furthermore , the diquark - antidiquark ( tetraquark ) scenario should have partners of x(3872 ) , with the charged partner possibly identified as the @xmath14 seen by bes and belle @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "more recently , a mixing scenario has been proposed @xcite , where it is suggested that the @xmath15 @xmath8 @xmath10 strongly couples to @xmath1 so that its mass is dynamically shifted about 100 mev downwards from the bare @xmath10 state .",
    "thus this scenario may both solve both the mass and decay width puzzles .",
    "qcd sum - rules have been used to study a number of @xmath8 scenarios for the x(3872 ) @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to assess whether the tetraquark or molecular currents provide an adequate description of x(3872 ) .",
    "for example , refs .",
    "@xcite find a tetraquark mass of about @xmath16 and a molecular mass of about @xmath17 , while refs .",
    "@xcite find nearly degenerate molecular and tetraquark masses of about @xmath18 .",
    "however , in these analyses it is not possible to find a sum - rule window of validity unless a 50% continuum contribution is permitted .",
    "mass predictions for @xmath8 states seem to be insensitive to the choice of tetraquark or molecular currents @xcite , but lead to different consequences for branching ratios @xcite . however , the tetraquark and molecular currents are related through fierz transformations , leading to ambiguities in interpreting the underlying quark configuration from the structure of the currents @xcite .",
    "qcd sum - rules have also been used to study mixed interpretations of the x(3872 ) .",
    "if mixed molecular and charmonium currents are used , the mass prediction decreases to about @xmath19 @xcite . from the qcd sum - rules perspective , the four - quark state ( or @xmath1 molecular state ) may couple more strongly to the charmonium hybrid than the @xmath15 charmonium , because the latter is @xmath20 suppressed in perturbation theory ( _ i.e. , _ the leading - order correction is chirally suppressed ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore whether the x(3872 ) can be described through a mixture of hybrid and molecular currents . although naive considerations seem to preclude such a mixing scenario because the expected masses of both the four - quark state and hybrid from qcd sum - rules are widely separated @xcite , our detailed analysis shows that a proper mixing current may lower the predicted mass compared to the pure charmonium hybrid .",
    "varying the mixing parameter , we can find a mass near x(3872 ) , suggesting that the mixing between the molecular and hybrid components lowers the energy to form a more stable state .",
    "the resulting sum - rule is also better behaved than the pure molecular case because we are able to find a sum - rule window of validity for a smaller continuum contribution ( 30% as opposed to 50% ) .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : section  [ thecorrelationfunction ] contains the field - theoretical calculation of the mixed correlator of molecular and hybrid charmonium currents , section  [ theanalysis ] presents the laplace qcd sum - rule analysis , and concluding remarks are in section  [ theconclusion ] .",

    "as mentioned earlier , the mass predictions emerging from tetraquark and molecular currents are very similar @xcite ; we have focussed on the molecular currents because the analysis can be contrasted with the scenario of mixed molecular and charmonium currents @xcite . in this work",
    "we consider mixed molecular / hybrid currents @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a dimensionless parameter that will be varied in the section  [ theanalysis ] analysis and @xmath32 is a mass scale that accounts for the different mass dimensions of the hybrid and molecular currents . with no loss of generality ,",

    ". nevertheless , we explore the effect of using the pole - scheme charm mass @xmath112 @xcite as a source of theoretical uncertainty . in this case",
    "the mass in the pure molecular limit ( @xmath113 ) is significantly above the x(3872 ) , and decreases with increasing @xmath31 until reaching the optimized mixing parameter @xmath114 ( see figs .",
    "[ continuum_pole_fig ] and [ mass_pole_fig ] ) .",
    "there is minimal effect on the sum - rule window and the continuum .",
    "thus in the pole scheme , mixing effects seem to be necessary for consistency with the x(3872 ) .     as a function of the continuum @xmath83 for @xmath114 for borel scales @xmath99 within the sum - rule region of validity : @xmath115 .",
    "the pole scheme has been used for the charm quark mass . ]     as a function of the borel scale @xmath99 for @xmath114 and the optimized continuum @xmath116 ( blue curve ) and a slightly smaller value @xmath109 ( red curve ) .",
    "the range of @xmath99 corresponds to the sum - rule region of validity @xmath117 for the central @xmath83 values .",
    "the pole scheme has been used for the charm quark mass . ]",
    "in summary , we have calculated the mixed correlation function of @xmath8 hybrid charmonium and molecular currents , enabling a qcd sum - rule analysis of the x(3872 ) as a mixed state coupling to both hybrid and molecular currents . in the range of mixing parameters near the pure molecular limit",
    ", the largest mass prediction is in good agreement with x(3872 ) and represents a significant mixing of hybrid and molecular currents . in general",
    ", the mixed current increases the stability of the sum - rule analysis compared to the pure molecular case @xcite . a mixed scenario where the x(3872 )",
    "couples to a mixture of hybrid and molecular currents is thus viable .",
    "however , as mentioned earlier , the sum - rule molecular and tetraquark currents are related by fierz transformations and hence the interpretation of the underlying quark configuration is ambiguous .",
    "we anticipate that use of tetraquark currents would not lead to a substantial change in our conclusions because the molecular and tetraquark qcd sum - rule analysis mass predictions are virtually indistinguishable @xcite .",
    "since only the four - quark state with @xmath118 can mix with the hybrid , the mixing pattern may have a role in explaining the x(3872 ) isospin - violating decay puzzle because the hybrid component @xmath119 decay channel is highly suppressed @xcite and will mainly decay into @xmath120 @xcite .",
    "the standard explanation of isospin violation in x(3872 ) decay is that , for some non - perturbative reasons , quarks like to be in diquark ( or meson ) pairs , so that @xmath121 $ ] and @xmath122 $ ] diquarks ( or meson clusters ) in the multi - quark system can be considered as a quasiparticle .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , @xmath121[\\bar c\\bar u]$ ] and @xmath122[\\bar c\\bar d]$ ] are independently bound .",
    "this pattern predicts two neutral ",
    "x(3872 ) \" states with a small mass difference , and charged partners of the x(3872 ) @xcite",
    ". similarly , the molecular scenario explains isospin violation in the decays @xcite and predicts a second neutral state with a larger mass mass splitting between the charged and neutral states ( see e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent discussion ) .",
    "previously , the charged partners of x(3872 ) had not been observed @xcite , but there is now evidence for their existence @xcite .",
    "note that the experimental mass difference from the x(3872 ) is about 20  mev , which does not seem to fit either the tetraquark or molecular expectation .",
    "the discovery of the neutral partner of the x(3872 ) is thus crucial for four - quark models of the x(3872 ) . in both models ,",
    "the neutral partners are composed of @xmath123 states , so a hybrid mixture in the @xmath118 component provides a new mechanism for a mass splitting between the neutral states .",
    "however , future work is needed to determine how a mixed charmonium hybrid and @xmath1 molecular scenario would affect the mass splitting of the neutral states and whether it would accomodate the observed isospin violation in x(3872 ) decays @xcite .",
