    "since the ll contribution corresponds to the on - shell quarks one can treat @xmath16 in the above formula as equal to the part of four momentum of the initial photon carried by the quark ; this latter variable is usually denoted by @xmath60 ( or simply @xmath61 ) .",
    "note also that in the above formula instead of a quark mass there appears the qcd scale @xmath62 .",
    "therefore this expression allows to describe all the light quark ( light as compared to the scale @xmath47 ) contributions to @xmath19 in a universal way .",
    "heavy quark contributions should be treated separately , according to the eqs .",
    "( [ mh ] , [ beta ] ) @xcite",

    "therefore in practice while solving the equations ( 14 ) the initial conditions have to be assumed from a model or taken from measurements at some ( low ) @xmath69 scale @xcite . on this basis the parton parametrizations for the photon can be constructed , see the appendix for the details of existing parton parametrizations .    in pre - qcd times , the hadronic structure of the photon has been solely attributed to the vector meson component ( @xmath70 ) in the ( real ) photon .",
    "therefore for the matrix element of the photon between the nucleon states , the following representation by the corresponding matrix elements for the @xmath71 current was assumed @xcite : = -m_^21 < n_n>+ ...    that was the basic assumption of the vector dominance model ( vdm ) or generalized vdm ( gvdm ) if higher vector mesons states were included @xcite .",
    "this non - perturbative ( or hadronic ) contribution to the structure of the photon is present of course in the measured structure function @xmath19 , as well as in @xmath72 or @xmath64 extracted from the experimental data .",

    "note that in practice not @xmath16 but the quantity @xmath73 is measured , x_vis = q^2 , where @xmath74 is the invariant mass of the visible hadronic system .",
    "for the nonzero target - photon virtuality @xmath75 , the measured quantity is x_vis = q^2 . from a measured value for @xmath73 one can reconstruct @xmath16 by an unfolding procedure .",
    "recently , in order to perform reliable unfolding , the events are grouped into classes of similar topology ( see ) , which roughly coincide with the contributions due to qpm , vdm or rpc ( rpc - resolved photon contribution , where photons interact through their partonic contents ) .    in the early analyses the separation between these contributions ( qpm with qcd corrections and vdm , basically )",
    "was obtained by introducing the parameter of the minimal transverse momentum of the produced hadrons , @xmath76 .",
    "the vdm ( or hadronic ) contribution should be negligible for the production of particles with @xmath0 larger than @xmath76 , where , on the other hand , other contributions should be included .",
    "the fkp approach @xcite , where this kind of cutoff parameter is built in , was natural here .",
    "note that in generation of two quark final state ( in f2gen event generators ) two extreme types of angular dependence for final quarks are assumed : point - like ( pl ) with angular dependence as in the lepton pair production in photon - photon collision and a `` peripheral '' one with the distribution corresponding to an exponential form of the @xmath0 dependence , with a mean of 300 mev ( as if the photon interacted as a hadron )  .",
    "nowadays the monte carlo generators herwig and pythia , adapted for dis@xmath5 in 1995 , can describe all these types of contributions with any of the existing parton parametrizations .",
    "it is no longer necessary to fit an empirical @xmath76 parameter to the data before unfolding .",
    "it is worth noticing here , that at present energies ( or @xmath15 scales ) light quark ( @xmath77 ) and heavy quark distributions are treated differently . for @xmath78",
    "quarks the qpm formula ( eq .",
    "( [ mh ] ) ) is applied ( at least close to the threshold ) , while for the lighter quarks the qcd corrections are necessary .",
    "note also that in the earlier measurements the @xmath79 quark contribution was usually subtracted from the structure function @xmath19 .",
    "unfolding can be performed using the traditional method based on linear scale or using the new approach with the logarithmic scale , especially useful for extracting @xmath19 results in the small @xmath16 region .    as we have already pointed out ,",
    "the study of the hadronic final state became part of the measurements of the structure function for the photon at @xmath11 colliders .",
    "the details of the studies of the hadronic final state will be presented in the next section . here",
    "we would only like to stress that some discrepancies have been found for certain distributions , like the pseudorapidity @xmath80 of final hadrons distributions .",
