    "unfortunately , it has turned out to be extremely difficult to obtain reasonable conjectures  not to mention the proofs  about the properties of a spacetime given by an initial value problem , as illustrated , for example , by the history of the cosmic censorship hypothesis .",
    "+ getting an overview for the phenomena appearing and making reasonable conjectures is an area numerical relativity can contribute a lot to and actually already has ; most impressive illustrated by the discovery of the echoing property by m. choptuik @xcite . but",
    "most of the codes used so far are designed to analyze local behaviour .",
    "statements about the behaviour in the large , global issues , are obtained by assuming that the extension of the grid used approximates an infinite grid well enough . this way it is very difficult to get a reliable error estimate and to decide ,",
    "what is sufficiently far , if not impossible at all . + but what global issues are of interest and why are they interesting ?",
    "+ firstly , there are questions related to cosmic censorship , especially the location and penetration of an event horizon , which is the boundary of the region of spacetime from where no null geodesic reaches null infinity . in a recent review article @xcite about cosmic censorship c.",
    "clarke writes about the location of event horizons : `` in terms of numerical simulations , this means that it is essential to perform the simulations in the compactified picture in which @xmath2 is represented explicitly '' .",
    "+ secondly , there is the whole topic of gravitational radiation on asymptotically flat spacetimes . due to the gauge freedom and the non - linearity of the theory",
    "the classification of radiation as ingoing and outgoing is a difficult issue .",
    "in- and outgoing gravitational waves are defined with respect to null infinity only .",
    "the related difficulties in extracting gravitational waves from the grid at finite distances and the problem with the avoidance of an unphysical reflection on the outer boundary of the grid are well    known and have been a topic for research for a long time . in most methods developed",
    "so far the error made consists of the error from reading off at finite distances and the discretization error .",
    "+ in this paper i will present the numerical implementation of a formalism allowing to calculate a `` compactified '' spacetime including @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "the solution of the problems concerning radiation is trivial by construction as will be seen .",
    "the only errors which may appear are caused by the discretization error of the numerical partial differential equation solver .",
    "these errors can be estimated and controlled by grid extrapolation techniques ( e.  g.  richardson extrapolation ) .",
    "although the calculations have been done under the assumption of spherical symmetry with a scalar field as model for radiation the simplicity and exactness of radiation extraction hold for arbitrary symmetry assumptions .",
    "+ furthermore , due to the spherical symmetry a special coordinate gauge could be found allowing to cover the complete domain of dependence of the initial hypersurface and to calculate the causal structure of a singularity .",

    "null caustics , which are caused e.g.  by gravitational lensing effects , must not appear .",
    "furthermore the evolution scheme can not penetrate event horizons .",
    "the extraction of radiation is complicated slightly as the weyl spinor is not a variable of the system  the determination of gravitational radiation requires to calculate numerically derivatives on .",

    "the definitions of asymptotical flatness given in the literature differ slightly .",
    "the following will be used here :    [ asymflat ] a spacetime @xmath9 is called * asymptotically flat * if there is another `` unphysical '' spacetime @xmath10 with boundary and a smooth embedding by which @xmath7 can be identified with @xmath11 such that :    1 .",

    "this method has been developed and applied to various matter sources by h.  friedrich   @xcite and myself @xcite .",

    "in addition to the already presented determination of the bondi mass i am going to demonstrate the simplicity of radiation extraction on two more examples in this subsection . in the first case the effects of the nonlinearities in the equations are analyzed  the purely backscattered radiation in region iii and the decay of the radiation in region iv of a regular spacetime model . in the second case values of the bondi mass in a singular model",

    "the main signal is stronger in the nonlinear case and there is some scalar field left in region ii .",

    "is approached and the values become inaccurate , only those points have been included in the plot where the results of a richardson extrapolation with 5000 and 10000 grid points are visually indistinguishable from those of an extrapolation with 10000 and 20000 grid points . in this plot the last 10 ( of 5000 ) points on before @xmath1 are missing .",
    "+ the slope in the asymptotical region is approximately @xmath272 .",
    "thus for very late times @xmath273 .",
    "+ unfortunately the bondi mass falls off so fast that rounding errors of the graphic program , with which the calculation of the mass is done and which has only single precision , do not allow to enter the asymptotical region with the constant slope for @xmath46 .",
    "+ but in spite of the accuracy problem near the center , figure [ purerest ] illustrates an advantage of the conformal method : the time scale of the collapse of the initial matter shell is of order @xmath134 , the fall off of the decay could be investigated for almost @xmath274 times the dynamical time scale .",
    "a rough estimate of the errors which are to be expected by reading of radiative quantities at finite radius has been made in the following way : given a lower bound for the area radius , the grid on a time slice has been searched for the first grid point @xmath275 with larger area radius . at that point",
    "@xmath275 the value for the hawking mass @xmath276 and the `` finite '' bondi mass , @xmath277 have been calculated .",
    "those values have been compared with the bondi mass on the intersection point of the future directed light cone of @xmath275 and @xmath0 .",
    "the model used corresponds to the parameter @xmath218 and develops strong gravitational fields , the spacetime has a singularity which catches approximately @xmath278 of the adm mass of @xmath279 .",
    "the outer boundary of the compact support of the scalar field lies at an area radius @xmath280 , @xmath275 has been chosen two , five and ten times that value , expressed in units of the adm mass , @xmath275 is at @xmath281 , @xmath282 or @xmath283 .",
    "+ the maximal relative error , i.  e.  error over adm mass , is approximately @xmath284 , @xmath285 and @xmath286 .",
    "but the relative error in the backscattering region iii ( error / mass loss in region iii ) is by a factor of 10 larger .",
    "those errors are the errors made by approximating null infinity by grid which ends at a finite physical distance .",
    "there is almost no difference between @xmath276 and @xmath287 .",
    "in the work reported in this paper a mathematical formalism , designed to investigate the structure of a spacetime in the large by conformal techniques , has been introduced into numerics .",
    "this paper demonstrates that global properties of a spacetime are numerically calculable and must not necessarily be estimated from a numerical simulation by heuristic arguments .",

    "the form of the equations differs from einstein s equations .",
    "the technical tricks developed for the numerical solution of einstein s equations can not be used unchanged . the accuracy problem",
    "as described in section [ accuracyproblem ] shows that there is still the potential for further progress .",
    "recently , too late to be included in this paper , a new way of discretizing was found , which propagates the regularity condition at the center without switching schemes near the center , as done here .",
    "the accuracy has improved by a factor of @xmath281 for models near the critical parameter .",
    "+ in this formalism important properties of spacetimes are automatically fulfilled , the adm mass is always conserved , the energy radiated away equals the change in the bondi mass , and there is no spurious ingoing wave caused by an unphysical reflection at the outer boundary .",
    "furthermore the location of event horizons is straightforward and the calculation yields `` penrose '' diagrams allowing to read off the causal structure of singularities .",
    "+ the obvious advantages might not be worth the effort for the investigation of astrophysical questions where most of the uncertainty originates in an approximate equation of state .",
    "but if one is interested in the use of numerical relativity as a substitute for the lacking experimental approach to the open problems of mathematical relativity , the conformal techniques provide a very promising approach . in this circumstance",
