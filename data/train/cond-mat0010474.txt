    "after the initial work by lampert,@xcite who proved the stability of the charged exciton complexes , charged excitons in bulk semiconductors @xcite as well as in an exactly two - dimensional ( 2d ) configuration @xcite were studied theoretically .",
    "these studies revealed that , due to the confinement , the 2d charged excitons have binding energies which are an order of magnitude larger than charged excitons in the corresponding bulk materials .",
    "the increased binding energy in reduced dimensionality systems together with the improved experimental techniques have allowed the experimentalists to observe them in quantum well structures.@xcite many of the experimental results reported in the literature are for charged excitons in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field.@xcite up to recently , there was little or no agreement between the experimental results and the available theories.@xcite    lately , however , progress was made in the direction of bringing theoretical prediction and experiments closer to each other .",
    "stb and moradi@xcite used a variational method which was valid in the low magnetic field regime and explained the minimum around @xmath4 tesla observed experimentally by shields _ et al._@xcite in the charged exciton singlet transition energy for a @xmath5   wide quantum well .",
    "recently muntenau _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite found a transition between the singlet ground state and the triplet ground state at @xmath6 t for a @xmath7   wide asymmetric quantum well , similar to the one predicted earlier by whittaker and shields@xcite for a @xmath8   wide symmetric quantum well .",
    "the triplet transition energies which have been so far identified are assigned to the angular momentum @xmath1 triplet state . in exactly 2d systems with translational invariance",
    "this state was shown@xcite to be an optically _ dark _ state .",
    "as a consequence , one would expect that such a state is dark also in quasi-2d systems , particularly in narrow quantum wells .",
    "the fact that the @xmath1 triplet is observed in quantum wells suggests that a breaking of symmetry occurs and in particular that the system is no longer invariant under a magnetic translation .",
    "recently , the existence of a bound _ bright _ triplet state , i.e. @xmath3 was predicted.@xcite due to its small binding energy , this triplet state could be difficult to detect .",
    "the possible existence of such a triplet state may force us to review the assignment that has been made of some of the photoluminescence lines .",
    "our previous works@xcite on charged excitons in quantum wells was limited to the case of zero magnetic field and showed that the stochastic variational method ( svm ) is an efficient technique for solving the effective mass hamiltonian of exciton complexes without involving any approximations . in ref .",
    "we showed that approximations made by stb _",
    "et al._@xcite in the coulomb matrix elements lead to an overestimation of the trion binding energy .",
    "the latter approximation aimed to convert the problem into an effective 2d problem . in our approach no simplifying approximations are made and the full 3d nature of the quantum well problem is retained .",
    "here we extend our previous work to the important experimental situation in which an uniform magnetic field is applied along the quantum well growth axis .",
    "our results for the magnetic field dependence of the trion singlet binding energy agrees , for the first time , with available experimental results on 100   and 300  wide gaas / algaas quantum wells .",
    "furthermore we find that the earlier predicted bright triplet is unbound for the 300   wide quantum well and probably marginally bound for the 100   wide quantum well .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present the hamiltonian of the problem and outline our method to obtain the energy of the exciton and charged exciton .",
    "the conditional probability density function of the trion , its pairs correlation functions and the average distance between the different particles in the trion are discussed in sec .",
    "iii . in sec .",
    "iv we compare our results for the transition energy and in sec .",
    "v for the binding energy with available experimental data on symmetric gaas / algaas quantum wells and with the theoretical results of whittaker and shields.@xcite in the last section we summarize our results and present our conclusions .",
    "in the effective mass approximation the hamiltonian describing a negative charged exciton , i.e. x@xmath9 , in an uniform magnetic field b is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the vector potential ; @xmath12 are the masses and charges of the interacting particles ; @xmath13 is the dielectric constant ; the confinement potential is @xmath14 if @xmath15 , with @xmath16 the quantum well width .",
    "the reference system is taken such that the origin of the coordinate system is at the center of the quantum well . for a gaas",
    "/ al@xmath17ga@xmath18as quantum well the heights of the square well confinement potentials are @xmath19 ev for the electrons and @xmath20 ev for the hole . if we consider the case where the magnetic field is applied along the growth axis of the well , i.e. @xmath21 , the hamiltonian becomes : @xmath22 is the @xmath23-component of the orbital momentum of the @xmath24th particle .",
    "the hamiltonian under examination has cylindrical symmetry with respect to the quantum well axis , i.e. @xmath23-axis , which implies that the z - component of the total orbital angular momentum , @xmath25 , is a conserved quantity , i.e. a good quantum number .",
    "the spin interaction is not explicitly included in our hamiltonian .",
    "the total spin of the electrons , @xmath26 , and the spin of the hole , @xmath27 , and their projections along the z - axis , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , are conserved quantities .",
    "notice that the state of the system is not degenerate with respect to the total electron spin .",
    "in fact the two electrons obey fermi - dirac statistics which means that the electronic part of the total wave function must be antisymmetric , i.e. when @xmath30 the spatial part of the electronic wave function must be symmetric and when @xmath31 the spatial part of the electronic wave function must be anti - symmetric .",
    "thus , @xmath26 can be used as a quantum number which indicates the parity of the state . once the projection along @xmath23 of the total orbital momentum , @xmath25 , and the electron spin @xmath26 are fixed we obtain , after solving our hamiltonian , a series of energy levels which we indicate by the quantum numbers @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the principal quantum number .",
    "these levels are degenerate with respect to the quantum number @xmath34 and @xmath29 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) is solved using the stochastic variational method which was outlined in ref . .",
    "the trial function , for the variational calculation , is taken as a linear combination of `` deformed '' correlated gaussian functions ( dcg ) , @xmath35 with @xmath36   k\\in \\{x , y , z\\ }   \\end{array}}}\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\beta^{k}_{qjln}(\\vec{r}_{j}-\\vec{r}_{l})^2\\right ] \\chi(1,2,3)\\right\\ } , \\nonumber } \\ ] ] and @xmath37 where @xmath38 gives the position of the @xmath39-th particle in the @xmath40-direction ; @xmath41 is the antisymmetrization operator and @xmath42 are the variational parameters , @xmath43 is the three particle spin function , and @xmath44 with @xmath45 integers such that @xmath46 for each value of @xmath47 , with @xmath25 the projection of the total angular momentum along the @xmath23-axis ; @xmath48 is the number of _ channels _ used to obtain our state ; @xmath49 indicates for brevity the set of quantum numbers which characterizes our state , i.e. @xmath32 .",
    "note that in contrast to the `` classical '' correlated gaussians , here , the parameter @xmath50 which expresses the correlation among the particle @xmath51 and the particle @xmath52 in the direction @xmath40 , is allowed to be different from the parameter @xmath53 which couples the same two particles @xmath51 and @xmath52 in a different direction @xmath54 .",
    "this additional degree of freedom in the calculation allows us to take into account the asymmetry introduced in the 3d space by the presence of the quantum well and of the magnetic field .",
    "a basis of dimension @xmath55 , e.g. 10 , is at first selected using the stochastic procedure .",
    "this does not ensure that the best basis set is found , so a refinement procedure is carried out on the basis set in order to improve it .",
    "the refinement is made by replacing the @xmath56-th state with a new state , i.e. with a state built using new parameters @xmath57 in such a way that the total energy is lowered .",
    "when the refinement process does not change the total energy significantly , the number of basis states is further increased .",
    "the process is reiterated multiple times for different and increasingly larger dimensions of the basis set , until the energy reaches the desired accuracy .",
    "the final dimension of the basis set consists typically of 400 states .",
    "faster convergence is obtained by taking into account the cylindrical symmetry , i.e. by choosing @xmath58 .",
    "notice also that with respect to the case without magnetic field , less basis states have to be used because the magnetic field localizes the particles around the magnetic center of mass leading to a faster convergence of the energy .",
    "the number of channels used depends on the magnetic field .",
    "for example , for the case @xmath3 , we found that for low magnetic fields we already obtain good results using one channel , which actually gives the largest contribution , while for large fields we have to use up to 7 channels , to obtain a reasonable convergence . on the other hand , for small magnetic fields",
    "we need larger number of states @xmath55 in order to accurately describe the trion energy .",
    "our numerical results are given for a gaas / al@xmath59ga@xmath18as quantum well .",
    "the parameter used in our calculation are @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 @xmath63 which give for our unit of length @xmath64 and energy @xmath65 mev .",
    "notice that @xmath66 and @xmath67 are calculated for the donor problem and do not depend on the hole mass which we took to be @xmath68 .",
    "often one uses @xmath69 and @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the exciton reduced mass , i.e. @xmath72 , which for our problem is @xmath73 corresponding to @xmath74   and @xmath75 mev .",
    "first we studied the magnetic field dependence of the interparticle average distance . in fig .",
    "[ average ] we present the 2d average distance , @xmath76 , vs. the magnetic field for the electron - electron pair and for the electron - hole pair , both in the @xmath77 state , i.e. the singlet ( solid curves ) and in the @xmath78 state , i.e. the triplet ( dashed curves ) for a 100   wide quantum well . as a comparison",
    "we show also the exciton electron - hole interparticle distance vs. magnetic field . for the exciton problem",
    "the electron and the hole are more strongly bound and the interparticle distance decreases more slowly than for the trion s singlet and triplet state .",
    "nevertheless , it decreases by @xmath79 over the magnetic field range shown in the figure . for the negatively - charged exciton",
    "the electron - electron average distance is always larger than the electron - hole average distance both for the electron spin - singlet state and for the electron spin - triplet state .",
    "this of course is a consequence of the repulsive electron - electron interaction , while the electron - hole is attractive .",
    "notice that for @xmath80 the electron - hole distance for the negative charged exciton is about twice the exciton one .",
    "the triplet state is more than 20 times larger than the singlet - state in the small magnetic field range where the triplet state is , in fact , unbound .",
    "the size of the charged exciton decreases with increasing magnetic field .",
    "this decrease is faster in the low magnetic field region , and it is faster for the triplet than for the singlet state .",
    "the reason is that the triplet state is more extended , it is less bound , and consequently an external magnetic field will have a larger effect on its size .",
    "notice also that for both states , i.e. singlet and triplet , the curves for @xmath81 and @xmath82 are almost parallel to each other , but nevertheless with increasing magnetic field the distance between them slowly decreases .",
    "next we calculated the 2d pair correlation function , @xmath83 , for the spin - singlet and spin - triplet state of a charged exciton in a quantum well of width 100   in a magnetic field of b@xmath84 t , see fig .",
    "we notice that the electron - hole pair correlation function both for the spin - singlet state ( dashed curve ) and for the spin - triplet state ( dash - dotted curve ) has its maximum when the distance between the particles is zero .",
    "this means that in both states the electron and hole have the tendency of staying close to each other .",
    "notice that the triplet electron - hole pair has a longer tail compared to the singlet one , indicating that the triplet is more extended but , nevertheless , the particles in this state are still correlated even at large distances .",
    "on the other hand the electron - electron pair correlation function in the singlet state ( solid curve ) shows that , even though the electrons have a significant probability of being close to each other , the correlation is maximal for @xmath85 which is a consequence of the coulomb repulsion between the electrons . in the triplet state",
    "the pair correlation function is zero if the particles are in the same position in space , which is an expression of the pauli exclusion principle , and has a maximum at @xmath86 .    to gain further understanding on how the system is influenced by the presence of a magnetic field",
    ", we studied the conditional probability , which gives the probability of finding one of the three particles in position @xmath87 when the other two particles are fixed at @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "notice that by fixing two of the particles we obtain information on the positional correlation of the third particle .",
    "we focus on the @xmath90-correlation since the effect of the applied magnetic field along the quantum well axis is larger in the plane orthogonal to the quantum well axis . along the @xmath23-direction",
    "the probability is mainly determined by the confinement potential . because the @xmath91- and @xmath92-axis are equivalent due to the cylindrical symmetry of the problem we take @xmath93 for all three particles and for brevity we will indicate @xmath94 by @xmath95 . in fig .",
    "[ sing - ee](a , b , c ) we plot @xmath95 for a negatively charged exciton in a 100 wide quantum well when the two electrons are fixed at a distance given by their average distance @xmath96 .",
    "notice that for @xmath80 t ( fig .",
    "[ sing - ee](a ) ) the hole is centered around each of the two electrons , while for @xmath97 t and for @xmath98 t ( fig .",
    "[ sing - ee](b , c ) ) the hole is mostly situated in the region between the two electrons . for @xmath80 t",
    "there is a smaller but not zero probability that the hole is between the two electrons .",
    "this binds the two electrons together .",
    "when a magnetic field is applied the electrons are on the average closer to each other and as a consequence the two `` hole clouds '' around the electrons overlap .",
    "the hole has almost the same probability of sitting on top of the two electrons or between them .",
    "notice , that when a magnetic field is applied the conditional probability still shows two `` kinks '' at the position of the two electrons , which are memories of the two peaks present in the conditional probability function at @xmath80 .",
    "furthermore , for increasing @xmath99 the hole wave function decays much faster when the hole moves away from the electron .",
    "the increased probability for the hole to sit between the two electrons leads to an increased _ bonding _ between the electrons .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the fact that the binding energy of the charged exciton increases when a magnetic field is applied .    in fig .",
    "[ sing - eh](a , b , c ) we plot @xmath95 for a charged exciton in a 100  wide quantum well when the hole and one electron are fixed at a distance equal to their average position @xmath100 , for the @xmath80 t case ( fig .",
    "[ sing - eh](a ) ) , the @xmath97 t case ( fig .",
    "[ sing - eh](b ) ) and the @xmath98 t case ( fig .",
    "[ sing - eh](c ) ) . the qualitative difference , between the situation when a large magnetic field is applied and when a low magnetic field is applied is not very pronounced , except for the length scale .",
    "however , we observe that for @xmath80 t the probability of having the second electron near the fixed electron is zero , while in the case in which a magnetic field is applied there is a finite probability for the second electron to be at the position of the first electron .",
    "since the charged exciton is in the singlet state , the spin function is asymmetric for an interchange of the two electrons and consequently there is no pauli exclusion principle to forbid the two electrons to be at the same position in space .",
    "only the electron - electron interaction will make the latter probability as small as possible .",
    "this result is consistent with the result obtained for the pair - correlation functions .",
    "next we consider the triplet state and limit ourselves to the magnetic field @xmath97 t. notice , that the triplet state is not bound for small magnetic fields .",
    "we plot @xmath95 for a charged exciton in a 100    wide quantum well when the two electrons are fixed ( fig . [ trip - ee](a ) ) and when one electron and the hole are fixed ( fig . [ trip - ee](b ) ) .",
    "notice that there is not much qualitative difference between the conditional probability function of the triplet state and of the singlet state ( see fig .",
    "[ sing - ee](b ) ) .",
    "quantitatively there are two major differences : i ) the average distance between the particles is substantially larger , and ii ) the probability to find the second electron at the same spatial position as the first one ( see fig . [ trip - ee ] ) is zero , while this is not the case for the singlet state . the latter is consistent with the fact that in the triplet state the electronic part of the wave function is antisymmetric under an exchange of the two electrons , which is also consistent with the fact that the electron - electron pair - correlation function is zero at the origin .",
    "in comparing our theoretical results with the available experimental data we assume that the observed peaks in the pl spectra are associated with an exciton , in which the electron and the hole recombine with emission of light , or with a recombination of a negatively - charged exciton , which leaves behind an electron in the lowest landau level .",
    "consequently , the transition energies are defined as @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the energy band gap and @xmath103 is the energy of a free electron in a quantum well of width w and in a magnetic field of strength @xmath99 ; @xmath104 and @xmath105 are , respectively , the exciton and charged exciton total energy .",
    "we will also take into account the zeeman splitting induced by the magnetic field , under the assumption that the transitions observed follow the energy diagram discussed in ref . .",
    "we also assume that the electron gyromagnetic factor , @xmath106 , and the hole gyromagnetic factor are the same for the exciton as well as for the charged exciton . the total zeeman splitting of each transition",
    "can then be written , in agreement with the results presented in ref .",
    ", as @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the bohr magneton .",
    "notice also that the gyromagnetic factor is defined using the same conventions as in ref .",
    ", i.e. the hole is considered to have an effective spin of @xmath109 instead of the real hole spin @xmath110 . as a consequence of this zeeman effect each transition line @xmath111",
    "is split into two lines , i.e. @xmath112 , associated to a change of 1 and -1 in the @xmath23-projection of the total angular momentum @xmath113 , i.e. @xmath114 , respectively .    in fig .",
    "[ shields - f ] we compare our theoretical results for the transition energies of a @xmath115 in a 300   wide quantum well ( curves ) with the experimental results of shields _ et al._@xcite ( symbols ) .",
    "we obtained the exciton gyromagnetic factor @xmath116 from the measured splitting between the negatively ( @xmath117 ) and the positively ( @xmath118 ) circularly polarized lines of ref . using eq .",
    "( [ zeeman ] ) .",
    "this value of @xmath119 is consistent with the results by ossau _",
    "et al._@xcite who found @xmath120 for a 250   wide quantum well .",
    "the experimental data presented in fig . [ shields - f ] are from the emitted negatively ( @xmath121 ) circular polarized light which results from transitions with @xmath122 .",
    "we choose the energy gap such that the exciton peak at @xmath80 t coincides with the experimental exciton peak for b=0 , which leads to @xmath123 mev .",
    "notice that for the singlet we reproduce the experimental behaviour , including the small minimum observed at low magnetic fields .",
    "both for the exciton and for the triplet state of the charged exciton we find good agreement up to 8 t. at small magnetic fields : 1 ) the theoretical results slightly overestimate the singlet transition energy which is probably a consequence of the importance of localization as argued , e.g. , in ref . , and 2 ) the triplet state is unbound for small magnetic fields and consequently not observable .",
    "notice also that the recently discussed@xcite bright triplet ( dotted curve ) is not bound in the considered magnetic field region .",
    "none of the observed transitions can be associated to such a bright triplet .",
    "the data in the range 8 - 20 t are from ref . and are obtained under different experimental conditions as compared to those from ref . which were measured in the range 0 - 8 t. for example , an increase in electron density",
    "will shift the experimental photoluminescence towards larger energies.@xcite if we perform an uniform shift of the experimental data by 0.5 mev in the 8 - 20 t range , which leads to the open symbols , a much better agreement with our theoretical results is obtained .    in fig .",

    "the energy gap is fixed by matching the @xmath127 t experimental and theoretical @xmath115 singlet transition energies which resulted into @xmath1281520.35 mev .",

    "is in rather good agreement with our results for the charged exciton singlet transition energy . for @xmath130 t ( see fig .",
    "[ manus - f](a ) ) there is a substantial deviation between theory and experiment which again may be attributed to an enhancement of the negatively charged exciton binding energy due to localization of the trion",

    "we may construct the following picture : 1 ) in the magnetic field range @xmath134 t quantum well width fluctuations and disorder break the translational invariance of the system which results into a breakdown of the optical selection rule , thus allowing the dark triplet negatively charged exciton state to be optically active ; 2 ) only in the very small magnetic field range , i.e. @xmath135 t , the localization of the trion due to quantum well width fluctuations leads to an increase of the singlet and triplet @xmath115 binding energy .",
    "for the 300 wide quantum well the effect of the quantum well width fluctuations on the trion energy is substantially smaller.@xcite this agrees with fig .",
    "[ shields - f ] where the magnetic field range over which the singlet binding energy is strongly enhanced is much smaller , i.e. @xmath136 t , and the size of the enhancement is also substantially smaller ; 3 ) in the very large magnetic field range @xmath2 t the optical selection rule is restored and no transition from the @xmath115 dark triplet is observed . because of the inhibition of the decay of the @xmath115 dark triplet it is possible that the bright triplet becomes sufficiently populated making it experimentally observable .",
    "we found that this @xmath115 bright triplet is at most marginally bound and therefore has almost the same transition energy as the exciton .    for @xmath137 t",
    "the experimental results are slightly lower in energy as compared to our theoretical results . a possible reason for this deviation may be the importance of band non - parabolicity at such large magnetic fields . for example ,",
    "if we increase the hole mass to @xmath138 at @xmath139 t , the @xmath115 singlet ( exciton ) transition energy becomes 1.5780 ev ( 1.5812 ev ) which is almost 2 mev lower than the @xmath68 result 1.5796 ev ( 1.5824 ev ) , thus proving a strong dependence of the transition energy on the hole mass value .",
    "this is mainly due to the difference in confinement energy .",

    "up to 15 t. for @xmath151 t the present triplet binding energy becomes appreciably larger than the one of ref . .",

    "previously we showed@xcite for @xmath80 , that the approximations i ) and ii ) lead to an overestimation of the binding energy of the charged exciton.@xcite whittaker and shields @xcite showed that the inclusion of higher subbands and of higher landau levels in the wave function substantially increases the high field singlet binding energy , while they have a smaller effect on the triplet binding energy .",
    "note that in agreement with whittaker and shields,@xcite and in contrast to the recent work by stb and moradi,@xcite we find that the spin - triplet state is unbound for @xmath80 t. this disagreement with the work of stb and moradi@xcite can be traced back to their poor variational function which gives an exciton energy which is about @xmath161 larger than ours , while the negatively charged exciton singlet energy is about @xmath162 lower than ours .",
    "it has been argued that the hole mass is asymmetric and that the in - plane hole mass depends on the magnetic field .",
    "one expects that the hole mass in the z - direction , i.e. the confinement direction , will almost not influence the exciton and trion binding energies .",
    "this is different for the in - plane hole mass which , e.g. through the reduced exciton mass @xmath71 , will change the exciton and to a lesser extent the trion energies . in a recent cyclotron resonance experiment by cole _",
    "et al._@xcite on p - doped ( 311)a gaas quantum wells the measured hole mass varies from @xmath163 for @xmath135 t to @xmath164 at higher fields for a 150   wide quantum well . for wider wells",
    "the large hole mass value was reached at smaller magnetic fields and therefore , this mass variation is expected not to be relevant for the 300 sample . in order to investigate the influence of the value of the in - plane hole mass on the trion singlet and triplet binding energy we compare in fig .",
    "[ bindingm ] our results with those for the asymmetric hole mass ( thin solid and dashed curves in fig .",
    "[ bindingm ] ) in which the in - plane hole mass was reduced to @xmath165 .",
    "notice that : i ) the singlet trion binding energy is substantially reduced ( about 0.5 mev ) ; ii ) the triplet binding energy is practically not altered and coincides with the whittaker and shields@xcite results for @xmath166 t , and iii ) there is a singlet - triplet crossing at about 40 t. with this smaller hole mass the exciton reduced mass is diminished by @xmath167 leading to a lower exciton binding energy and also to an increase of the trion total energies .",
    "this shifts the theoretical curves in fig .",
    "[ manus - f ] in such a way that an unrealistic low band gap of 1518.3 mev has to be assumed in order to match the experimental and theoretical @xmath168 t trion transition energies .",
    "furthermore , the agreement between theory and experiment is lost for @xmath169 t and the experimental trion singlet energy for @xmath170 t is now higher than the theoretical curve which disagrees with the idea of an enhanced trion binding energy in this low field region due to quantum well width fluctuations .",
    "these findings argue against such a reduced hole mass , even in the low magnetic field range .    it should also be noted that the use of a cyclotron mass in our calculation may be questionable . in a cyclotron resonance experiment ,",
    "transitions between two landau levels are induced and from the transition energy @xmath171 one defines the cyclotron mass @xmath172 , where @xmath173 is the energy of the n - th landau level .",
    "notice that such a definition only corresponds to the effective hole mass if the hole mass is independent of the landau level .",
    "furthermore , e.g. , electric subband crossings and polaron effects may invalidate such an assignment . a further argument against the use of the low magnetic field cyclotron hole mass published by cole _",
    "et al._,@xcite is that those results are for the ( 311 ) gaas plane while the experiments of vanhoucke _ et al._@xcite were performed on samples with quantum wells in the ( 100 ) plane .",
    "it is well known that in the latter crystallographic direction , with increasing density or increasing magnetic field , the hole mass very quickly reaches a value in the @xmath174 range , the exact value depends on the quantum well width ( see for example ref . ) .",
    "we believe that this argues in favor of the use of @xmath68 in the important @xmath175 t magnetic field region as we did .",
    "for the 100   wide quantum well no experimental results on the trion binding energy are available .",
    "therefore , we show in fig .",
    "[ manus - f1 ] the energy difference between the two transition lines as measured in ref .",
    "and compare them with : 1 ) the negatively charged exciton singlet binding energy ( solid curve ) , 2 ) the energy difference between the negatively charged exciton dark triplet and singlet ( dashed curve ) , 3 ) the energy difference between the negatively charged exciton bright triplet and singlet ( dotted curve ) . to be complete",
    "we also show the negatively charged exciton bright triplet binding energy .",
    "this figure nicely illustrates how in the low magnetic field region , and more precisely in the range 6 - 18 t the experimental results are clearly not related to the binding energy of the @xmath115 singlet state but rather to the difference between the dark triplet state and the singlet state energy . in the high magnetic field region , i.e. @xmath176 t ,",
    "the experimental results are closer to the singlet state binding energy and to the energy difference between the bright triplet state and the singlet state .",
    "we presented a calculation of the lowest energy levels of the negatively charged exciton spectrum in a quantum well and in the presence of a magnetic field which is perpendicular to the quantum well plane .",
    "our approach is based on the stochastic variational method in which the trion wavefunction is expanded in deformed correlated gaussian functions .",
    "the important correlation between the particles is built in this wavefunction and therefore such an approach is well suited for problems in which the binding of the system is a pure consequence of the particle - particle correlation as is the case for the trion .",
    "we do not observe any spin - singlet / spin - triplet transition using the symmetric mass approximation , however such a transition is found for the 100   wide quantum well if we use the asymmetric hole mass approximation ( i.e. a substantially lower in - plane hole mass ) , in agreement with what was predicted by whittaker and shields.@xcite the singlet - triplet transition is found to occur at about @xmath177 t , in contrast to the predicted @xmath178 t reported in ref . .",
    "we have argued that at such high magnetic fields the larger in - plane hole mass should be used and consequently we believe that this transition should not occur in reality for @xmath179 t. muntenau _ et al._@xcite observed a spin - singlet / spin - triplet transition in an asymmetric quantum well in which electrons and holes are spatially separated .",
    "such a singlet - triplet transition is then of the same nature as the one predicted for spatially separated charged donor systems.@xcite    a comparison between our theoretical results and available experiments gives good agreement for the trion singlet and triplet energy .",
    "particular good agreement is achieved with the experimental results of shields _",
    "et al._@xcite on the 300   quantum well . for the results on the 100   quantum well we find good agreement for the trion singlet state while for the higher energy transition we find for @xmath131 t that the results agree with the dark triplet transition , while for @xmath2 t this transitions agrees more closely with the exciton transition energy or the bright triplet energy . because the latter two have , in this magnetic field region , practically the same energy we are not able to make any definite assignment for this transition line .",
