    "<S> the convergent close - coupling method is applied to the calculation of fully differential cross sections for ionization of atomic hydrogen by 15.6  ev electrons . </S>",
    "<S> we find that even at this low energy the method is able to yield predictive results with small uncertainty . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> , we suspect that the experimental normalization at this energy is approximately a factor of two too high .    at the base of all electron - atom scattering and </S>",
    "<S> ionization problems is the fundamental , yet unsolved , three - body problem of an electron interacting with atomic hydrogen . </S>",
    "<S> this problem occupies a special place in the set of unsolved problems of interest to physicists due to its fundamental nature in the realm of atomic physics . </S>",
    "<S> it represents a class of coulomb three - body problems which includes electron interaction with the single positive ion of helium , and hence the problem of helium double photoionization .    for heavier atoms the complexity of the coulomb three - body problem may be masked by the collective behaviour of the many target electrons </S>",
    "<S> similarly , for high incident electron energies the complicated role played by the long - ranged coulomb interaction is also somewhat hidden . </S>",
    "<S> the problem exhibits all of its complexities at energies a little above the ionization threshold for the simplest atomic target , namely hydrogen . </S>",
    "<S> here we have the possibility of exciting a countably infinite number of the hydrogen discrete states as well as the three - body continuum of two very slow strongly interacting electrons . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we consider the e - h problem at the incident electron energy of 15.6  ev , i.e. only 2  ev above the ionization threshold .    to solve the e - h problem at a total energy @xmath0 ( presently 2  ev ) and spin @xmath1 means to correctly predict all of the possible scattering amplitudes @xmath2 for discrete excitation of target eigenstates with energy @xmath3 with @xmath4 , and ionization amplitudes @xmath5 with @xmath6 . for the discrete transitions the close - coupling methods have proved to be the most successful , particularly at low energies . </S>",
    "<S> these rely on expanding the total wave function in a set of orthonormal states . from the landmark work of , followed by , and others , it became clear that the set of orthonormal states obtained by diagonalising the target hamiltonian in a laguerre basis formed an unusual equivalent - quadrature rule . </S>",
    "<S> thus - obtained states provide a quadrature rule that incorporates both the infinite set of true target discrete states and the true target continuum . </S>",
    "<S> this is an immensely powerful result and forms the basis of the convergent close - coupling ( ccc ) method for the calculation of electron - atom scattering  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the idea relies on simply increasing the number of expansion states @xmath7 until convergence in the amplitude of interest @xmath8 is obtained to an acceptable accuracy , just like with standard numerical quadrature . </S>",
    "<S> this approach has proved very successful for the discrete transitions at all energies . in the rare case of substantial discrepancy with experiment  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite subsequent new measurements were found to be in agreement with the ccc theory  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> obtaining reliable scattering amplitudes for the discrete transitions is a good start , but what about ionization ? the square - integrable expansion - states @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , obtained by diagonalising the target hamiltonian in a laguerre basis of size @xmath11 , have both negative and positive energies @xmath12 . with increasing @xmath13 </S>",
    "<S> the negative - energy states converge to the true eigenstates ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) , and the positive - energy states yield an increasingly dense discretization of the continuum . by summing the integrated cross sections , obtained upon solution of the close - coupling equations , for just the positive - energy states </S>",
    "<S> yields excellent agreement with the measurements of the e - h total ionization cross section ( tics ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> though this is the least informative ionization process it is an encouraging first step . the question is : do the scattering amplitudes for the excitation of the positive - energy @xmath9 contain all of the detailed ionization information ?    before proceeding further let us define some convenient notation . </S>",
    "<S> suppose we are interested in describing an experiment where the two outgoing electrons have momenta @xmath16 and @xmath17 with @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> when performing the diagonalizations we ensure , by varying the exponential fall - off parameter @xmath19 @xcite , that for each @xmath20 we have a state @xmath21 whose energy is @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> we will refer to these states collectively as @xmath23 with energy @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> though it is rarely practical , let us further suppose that the same diagonalizations have resulted in states @xmath25 whose energies @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> we shall collectively refer to these states as @xmath27 with energy @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the scattering amplitudes @xmath8 for the excitation of the states @xmath23 and @xmath27 , arising upon solution of the @xmath13-state close - coupling equations , we write as @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> note that the close - coupling formalism ensures that the total wave function is expanded explicitly antisymmetrically using the states @xmath9 , with the arising equations solved separately for each total spin @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , each @xmath32 may always be thought of as a combination of the direct @xmath33 and exchange @xmath34 amplitudes , eg . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath35 for hydrogen . </S>",
    "<S> the close - coupling boundary conditions assume that only one electron is ever allowed to escape to true infinity , asymptotically as a plane wave . </S>",
    "<S> it is helpful to keep in mind that the energies @xmath36 are symmetrically on either side of @xmath37 , and that the summation of the integrated cross sections to obtain tics includes both sets of amplitudes @xmath29 and @xmath30 combined as cross sections . for equal - energy sharing @xmath38 , which we consider as the limit @xmath39 .    the work of attempted to provide a correct interpretation of the already calculated positive - energy - state scattering amplitudes , with some surprising and controversial results . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that the ( e,2e ) ionization amplitudes may be defined from the @xmath29 by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a coulomb wave ( in the case of h target ) of energy @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> this definition is in fact a simplification of the pioneering work of . </S>",
    "<S> the overlap has the effect of changing the unity normalization of @xmath23 to that of the true continuum , as well as introducing a one - electron coulomb phase . </S>",
    "<S> the controversy @xcite arises not from the above definition , but from the subsequent use of ( [ e2eamp ] ) to define the triply differential cross section ( tdcs ) by @xmath43 the second term above looks like an exchange term , but it is not . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitudes @xmath29 , and hence @xmath44 are already a coherent combination of their own direct and exchange amplitudes as determined by @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the two terms have very different origin . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitudes @xmath29 arise from the excitation of the states @xmath23 , with the boundary condition that the `` @xmath16 '' electron exits as a plane wave totally shielded from the ion by the bound @xmath23 electron . for @xmath45 </S>",
    "<S> this is the physically sound shielding approximation , as used in the born approximation where the slow electron is modeled by a coulomb wave and the fast one by the plane wave . </S>",
    "<S> however , the boundary conditions for the amplitude @xmath30 are unphysical ( low - energy outgoing plane wave shielded by a higher energy bound state ) . yet , these two theoretically distinguishable amplitudes correspond to the same ionization process since @xmath46 .    from ( [ tdcs ] ) we see that close - coupling yields twice as many amplitudes as we may expect from formal ionization theory . in the often used language of direct and exchange amplitudes we have two such pairs @xmath47 and @xmath48 , which are very different for @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> note , there is no symmetrization relation between the close - coupling theory calculated @xmath44 and @xmath50 as claimed by . in forming the tdcs we have @xmath51 , @xmath52 and cross terms @xmath53 , generally very different for each @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> a careful numerical study of the problem led to the suggestion that with increasing @xmath13 the second term in ( [ tdcs ] ) and hence both @xmath55 and @xmath56 converge to zero  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this allows for consistency with formal ionization theory except that the @xmath57 are obtained only for @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> however , for finite @xmath13 a consistent interpretation ( compatible with the definition of tics ) of the close - coupling approach to ionization requires the use of both terms . </S>",
    "<S> a further consequence of the numerical study  @xcite is that the close - coupling method is unable to obtain convergence to a satisfactory accuracy in the singly differential cross section ( sdcs ) whenever the true sdcs at equal energy - sharing is substantial . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , it was argued , that if the true sdcs was known then accurate angle - differential ionization cross sections could still be predicted . </S>",
    "<S> here we test this claim at just 2  ev above threshold , where the sdcs may be reasonably assumed to be approximately flat @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the concept of convergence with increasing @xmath58 involves both the increase of @xmath59 and @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> we performed a series of calculations for various @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the ones presented may be conveniently denoted by ccc(@xmath60 ) with @xmath61 . to examine the rate of convergence we present two vastly different calculations ccc(20,5 ) and ccc(13,4 ) , which require approximately 2 gb and 500 mb of computer ram , respectively . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> the laguerre exponential fall - off parameter was @xmath62 with the variation performed to ensure that for each @xmath20 there was a state @xmath21 with energy @xmath63=1  ev . in the present equal energy - sharing case the two terms in </S>",
    "<S> are evaluated using the same set of amplitudes , assuming a continuous limit of @xmath64 .    </S>",
    "<S> the first test of the calculations is the comparison of the total ionization cross sections ( tics ) and its spin asymmetry @xmath65 with the highly accurate measurement @xcite of tics 1.08 ( @xmath66 ) and the @xmath67 measurements  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ccc(20,5 ) and ccc(13,4 ) results for the tics , @xmath65 are 1.18 , 0.50 and 0.91 , 0.51 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we see that both calculations attribute approximately the correct amount of electron flux to the two spin ionization channels . the tics results from other calculations typically varied around the experimental value . </S>",
    "<S> the reliability of various close - coupling based theories for the calculation of the tics at low energies has been discussed in detail by . </S>",
    "<S> the difficulty of the problem of obtaining accurate ionization amplitudes at this energy is indicated by the fact that the total cross section is more than forty times bigger , 4.7 , 4.8 and 4.6@xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) respectively for the ccc(20,5 ) , ccc(13,4 ) and experiment of .    </S>",
    "<S> next we consider the energy distribution within the ionization channels , i.e. the sdcs , defined by @xmath70 the tics @xmath71 is obtained by performing the integration @xmath72 the integral in is equivalent to the sum of the integrated cross sections for the excitation of the positive - energy states . </S>",
    "<S> the step function hypothesis @xcite says that the second term in converges to zero with increasing @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of the two terms in are the two terms in . </S>",
    "<S> we think of the second term as numerical `` left - overs '' from an incomplete convergence with @xmath13 , due to its minor contribution ( past 1  ev ) to the tics . </S>",
    "<S> integration of , for a given secondary energy @xmath73 , over the angular variables yields the integrand of .    </S>",
    "<S> 2truecm    in the spin - averaged sdcs are presented . </S>",
    "<S> we see that there is no convergence in the ccc(20,5 ) and ccc(13,4 ) results , though the integral of both is much the same . </S>",
    "<S> the step function ccc(@xmath74 ) is an estimate of what the ccc - calculated sdcs would converge to for @xmath75 ( there are no problems in obtaining convergence with increasing @xmath76 ) . in other words </S>",
    "<S> , we assume that at this low energy the true sdcs is approximately flat . </S>",
    "<S> since the close - coupling theory is unitary we can not have double counting of the tics , and hence suppose that with increasing @xmath13 the sdcs defined in becomes non - zero only for @xmath77 . in experiment the observed sdcs is symmetric about @xmath37 with the tics being obtained upon integration to @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> comparison with the experimental sdcs requires both terms of . </S>",
    "<S> for the substantially asymmetric energy - sharing kinematics    only the first term contributes significantly , but both are necessary at equal energy - sharing . from </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the angular distributions determined by ( [ tdcs ] ) will be much too small in magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> in order that the integration of ( [ tdcs ] ) over the angular variables , the endpoint of the integrand in , yielded the estimated sdcs of 1.08 ( @xmath66/ev ) we will multiply the equal energy - sharing ccc - calculated tdcs by @xmath78 .    </S>",
    "<S> in we present the tdcs calculated by the two ccc models and compare these with experiment and the previously overall best agreement - yielding theory , the distorted - wave born approximation ( dwba ) of . </S>",
    "<S> the relative measurements were initially presented by , but were remeasured and put on the absolute scale , with an estimated 35% uncertainty , by . </S>",
    "<S> the dwba calculations  @xcite work relatively well at this low energy since they utilize the effective charge formalism of in the distorting potentials . for an example of a more common dwba approach and the 3c theory see and , respectively .    in the tdcs figure </S>",
    "<S> we use the convenient , for the coplanar geometry , convention that the negative scattering angles are on the opposite side of the incident beam ( @xmath79-axis ) . </S>",
    "<S> for best visual comparison with the rescaled ccc calculations we have multiplied all of the experimental values by the single constant of 0.45 . </S>",
    "<S> having done so , we see excellent agreement between the two ccc calculations and experiment for all geometries , which is of considerable improvement on the comparison with the dwba calculation . </S>",
    "<S> the quality of the agreement gives us confidence that the rescaling of the experiment has brought it into consistency with the estimated sdcs value at 1  ev of 1.08 ( @xmath66/ev ) . </S>",
    "<S> should the true sdcs prove to be a little convex(concave ) then the experimental rescaling should be done by a factor a little greater(smaller ) than 0.45 . </S>",
    "<S> perhaps the experimentally determined normalization is an indication that the sdcs is more convex than concave . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> , we do not believe that the theory of pan and starace as presented by is a factor of two too low at 15.6  ev , and may indeed be accurate at all energies . </S>",
    "<S> though not presented they are almost indistinguishable from the @xmath80 rescaled ccc(20,5 ) tdcs .    </S>",
    "<S> let us turn specifically to the case where the two detectors are kept @xmath81 apart . </S>",
    "<S> though no experiment is available for this case we present it because it shows the greatest difference between the two ccc calculations , but is still experimentally measurable . in fact , smaller @xmath82 geometries yield even greater differences . </S>",
    "<S> such geometries , first suggested by , are an excellent test of the ccc theory because the cross sections fall rapidly with decreasing @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the bigger calculation yields the smaller cross section for @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> this is an important indication of how well the ccc theory is working . for the other presented cases </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the shapes of the two calculations are much the same , even though one requires four times as much computational resources as the other , suggests rapid shape convergence for the largest cross sections . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , almost identical overall magnitude suggests that convergence to the true correct sdcs is extremely slow .    </S>",
    "<S> so how is it that the ccc theory yields such good tdcs angular distributions ? to help answer this question let us have a look in more detail at the symmetric geometry </S>",
    "<S> . given the good agreement between ccc(13,4 ) and ccc(20,5 ) tdcs </S>",
    "<S> one would imagine that one may readily interchange the partial wave amplitudes of ( [ e2eamp ] ) @xmath83 in the two calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the curve labeled by ccc(mix ) was generated by taking the 1  ev @xmath84 partial wave amplitude of the ccc(20,5 ) calculation and using it with the other @xmath20 ccc(13,4 ) amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> whereas one may reasonably expect the ccc(mix ) calculated tdcs to be between the other two , it differs substantially when the two electrons emerge close together . </S>",
    "<S> this is an indication of the importance of treating all partial waves in a consistent manner . the laguerre basis choice @xmath61 with similar @xmath19 results in much the same integration rule over the true continuum for each @xmath20 . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> the number of positive energy states and their separation is similar for each @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> we also use the same set of states for each partial wave of total orbital angular momentum @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for each @xmath85 , the error in the energy distribution is also very similar for each @xmath20 , and this is why the ccc(@xmath86 ) calculations yield good tdcs angular distributions whose magnitude is in error by a single constant .    what have we learned from this and preceding studies ? </S>",
    "<S> the ccc approach to e - h scattering has not fully solved this coulomb three - body problem . </S>",
    "<S> given the complexity of the problem it is not surprising that the close - coupling approach should run into an intractable problem . </S>",
    "<S> whereas we are confident of obtaining accurate discrete scattering amplitudes ab initio at all energies , not so for the ionization amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> accurate ionization amplitudes may require too many states , depending on the incident energy , for practical implementation of the ccc theory . </S>",
    "<S> however , we have suggested two empirical prescriptions that still allow for the ccc - calculated ionization amplitudes to be useful and predictive , though with some uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> the first , demonstrated here , ensures rapid convergence in the angular distributions . </S>",
    "<S> it relies on taking a similar quadrature rule in the continuum for all target - space @xmath20 , total orbital angular momentum @xmath85 and total spin @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> defining @xmath61 with @xmath87 for each @xmath85 and @xmath31 achieves this . </S>",
    "<S> there may be other more efficient approaches that use a different basis as in say the intermediate - energy r - matrix method @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a sensible choice for @xmath88 is also important . </S>",
    "<S> the second prescription , necessary at low energies when the true sdcs is substantially large at @xmath37 , is that of rescaling the cross sections according to the ratio of the estimated true sdcs and the close - coupling - calculated sdcs . at high - enough energies </S>",
    "<S> no such rescaling is necessary and most aspects of the problem may be obtained accurately fully ab initio @xcite . given the general structure of the true sdcs at low energies , and that the close - coupling based theories obtain the correct tics , estimating the true sdcs is likely to yield only a minor error . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in some cases accurate sdcs are available from experiment and other theories . with these two empirical prescriptions </S>",
    "<S> the close - coupling approach to ionization has practical application at all incident energies , energy - sharing , and geometries of the two detectors .    </S>",
    "<S> there are a number of opinions relating to improving the close - coupling - calculated ionization amplitudes in an ab initio manner such as by matching the calculated total wave function to the correct asymptotic three - body boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> however , we note that once the close - coupling equations have been solved the electron flux has been incorrectly distributed within the ionization channels . </S>",
    "<S> this information will be hidden in the total wave function and we suspect will require empirical correction of some kind prior to matching . </S>",
    "<S> we thank steve jones for providing the dwba data in electronic form . </S>",
    "<S> support of the australian research council and the flinders university of south australia is acknowledged . </S>",
    "<S> we are also indebted to the south australian centre for high performance computing and communications . </S>"
