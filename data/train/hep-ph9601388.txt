    "it has been shown @xcite for the @xmath79 case , that in the infinite momentum frame ( imf ) contributions of fock states with anti - particles vanish and only contributions with forward moving particles survive .",
    "this statement is also true for other fock states we are dealing with . in the imf - limit",

    "@xmath88 has been taken out .",
    "it would cancel when going to probability densities by an appropriate factor of the jacobian of the transformation ( [ kinimf ] ) .",
    "if the vertex function used does not contain a derivative of the meson field , we could have equally well used covariant perturbation theory instead of topt .",
    "but if the vertex function used contains a derivative of the meson field this is no longer true . to illustrate this point",
    "let us consider the example of the pseudovector @xmath19 vertex , given by @xmath89 where for simplicity the coupling constant and isospin structure have been suppressed .",

    "the reason for this puzzle is , that by using a derivative coupling , an additional off - shell dependence is introduced into the vertex function , which can not be suppressed in the imf - limit .",
    "a way out is to use topt . here",
    ", however , the problem arises how to choose the meson energy in the vertex . in principle",

    "the resulting splitting functions for the baryon and meson fulfill eq.([sym ] ) .",
    "thus topt , in contrast to a covariant calculation , is consistent with the convolution approach .",
    "the remaining point to clarify is which of the two prescription one should use .",
    "we will always use prescription b , because in this prescription the splitting functions for the pseudovector case are identical to those of the pseudoscalar case , if the coupling constants are identified properly .",
    "moreover , in this prescription the structure of the vertex is due to the baryonic current only @xcite .",
    "the most general structure of the hadronic tensor must include the dependence on off - shell effects @xcite .",
    "because a realistic calculation of such off - shell effects is not possible at present , we shall neglect such effects in this paper . because of the extended nature of the hadrons involved one has to introduce phenomenological vertex form factors , which parameterize complicated unknown microscopic effects .",
    "the form factors are included in the calculation by replacing the vertex function @xmath98 by @xmath99 .",
    "now relation ( [ sym ] ) , which can be shown to hold exactly in the case of point - like particles ( in either covariant and topt calculations ) , imposes a severe restriction to these form factors : @xmath100 the form factors often used in meson exchange models and convolution models are functions of @xmath18 only , the four - momentum squared of the meson .",
    "it is to be expected that form factors which depend only on the kinematical variables of only one of the two particles of the two - body system , like the often used dipole form factor @xmath101 will not satisfy eq.([sym ] ) .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that these form factors do not conserve basic quantities like charge and momentum simultaneously .",

    "an universal cut - off parameter of the dipole form factor has been assumed for simplicity @xcite , the procedure proposed in section iii leads to important modifications .",
    "we find a much smaller probability of the @xmath181 ( 6.2 % in comparison to 16.1 % in ref.@xcite ) fock component and a substantially larger probability of the @xmath182 component ( 10.9 % in comparison to only 1.6 % in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "summarizing , including all components in the nucleon wave function expansion ( [ fock ] ) leads to a good agreement with the nmc result @xcite of the gottfried sum rule @xmath183 ( see table 2 ) .",
    "it should be noted here , that the true experimental value of @xmath176 might be even somewhat smaller than the nmc result due to shadowing effects in the deuteron @xcite .    in calculating the @xmath184 asymmetry in the present paper we have neglected the interference diagrams like @xmath185 or @xmath186 .",
    "while the contributions of such diagrams to the number and momentum sum rule cancel , their contribution to @xmath187 , @xmath188 as well as to the @xmath184 asymmetry is not protected by any conserved current and is in principle possible .",

    "there are different reasons for the smallness of these contributions . while the @xmath185 is small due to a small coupling constant @xmath198 , the @xmath186 contribution is small due to the vanishing tensor coupling constant @xmath199 .",
    "thus the peculiarities of the nucleon - meson - nucleon couplings allows one to safely neglect the interference terms .",
    "as has been emphasized in ref.@xcite , an attractive feature of the meson cloud is that a large fraction of the nucleon sea can be attributed to the virtual mesons ( see also ref.@xcite ) .",
    "let us consider this issue in more detail in the case of the present model .",
    "for this purpose the global ccfr experimental data @xcite    @xmath200    obtained at an average value of @xmath201 are useful . in the formulas above @xmath202 denote second moments of the quark distributions @xmath203 . obtaining the quantities given by eq.([ratio ] ) in our model is not straightforward .",
    "first of all , the experimental data has been measured at relatively large @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , the model has to be extended by the inclusion of extra sea of a perturbative nature .",
    "secondly , the quantities in eq.([ratio ] ) are sensitive to the valence quark distributions which can not be calculated fully consistently @xcite . in spite of these difficulties it seems instructive to make an estimate of those quantities .",
    "it is consistent within our approximation scheme to assume a simple structure of bare baryons and take into account fully dressed mesons .",
    "calculation of the ccfr quantities implies knowledge of the @xmath1-dependences of the quark distributions . for the mesons we take quark distribution functions known from the analysis of the drell - yan processes in the pion - nucleus collisions @xcite . for the bare baryons the situation is somewhat more complicated , and some approximations are unavoidable . for the purpose of comparison with the global quantities like those given by eq.([ratio ] ) it is sufficient to approximate valence quark distributions by those of the physical baryons . a similar approximation for the sea quarks is , however , not realistic as within our model a large fraction of the nucleon s sea is included explicitly via the pionic ( mesonic ) cloud . as discussed in ref.@xcite",
    ", this effect can be approximately included by reducing the total nucleon s sea , known from dis , by a factor @xmath204 .",
    "our model , as discussed later , predicts both asymmetry between @xmath205 and @xmath206 quark distributions and a suppression of the strange sea in comparison to the non - strange sea . on the other hand ,",
    "perturbative qcd predicts @xmath207 - @xmath206 symmetry and allows for relative suppression of the strange component .",
    "it is an empirical fact that at @xmath41 = 4 gev@xmath208 the strange sea is suppressed by a factor 2 .",
    "it is interesting how much of this effect is of perturbative / nonperturbative nature .",
    "one could use the ccfr parameter @xmath209 ( see eq.([ratio ] ) ) to fix the strangeness suppression factor @xmath210 for the sea quark distributions in mesons , baryons and the bare nucleon ( not dressed with mesons ) , @xmath211    in the present paper we adjust the two unknown parameters @xmath204 and @xmath210 to the ccfr quark distributions @xmath212 @xcite and to the ccfr parameter @xmath209 @xcite . in principle",
    "both @xmath213 and @xmath209 depend explicitly on @xmath204 , @xmath210 . in practice",
    "the situation is simpler because @xmath213 depends mainly on @xmath204 and is almost independent of @xmath210 while @xmath209 depends mainly on @xmath210 and is almost independent of @xmath204 .",
    "this allows us to extract the two parameters .",
    "if we take the @xmath214 msr @xcite sea parameterization for the bare nucleon ( we assume that the valence quark distributions in baryons are related via @xmath10 symmetry ) , we find @xmath215 and @xmath216 . the corresponding @xmath217 is compared with the `` experimental '' sea quark distribution of the ccfr collaboration @xcite in fig.9 and the resulting parameter @xmath209 = 0.40 .",
    "the other ccfr parameters are then : @xmath218 , @xmath219 , slightly above their experimental counterparts .",
    "the small overestimation can be easily understood because these two quantities are sensitive to the valence quark distributions which can not be calculated fully consistently @xcite .",
    "we expect the values of @xmath220 and @xmath221 to be biased by the approximations made up to 15% .",
    "while @xmath204 depends to some extend on the parameterization of the sea quark distributions used , @xmath210 is fairly stable",
    ". therefore the result of the fit suggests that the empirical suppression of the perturbative strange sea component at @xmath41 values of a few gev@xmath208 is about 0.75 in comparison to the total strange sea suppression of 0.5 .",
    "the difference is due to nonperturbative effects of the meson cloud .",
    "not only global quantities like the gottfried sum rule or the ccfr parameters are of interest .",
    "also the @xmath1-dependence of various quantities is helpful in testing models .",
    "it is known that sufficiently far above the strangeness production threshold the qcd evolution equations @xcite lead to the production of a perturbative @xmath10 symmetric sea . in this context",
    "it is useful to study differences of quark distributions instead of the distributions themselves , especially those describing the @xmath1-dependence of the @xmath173 and @xmath10 symmetry violation of the sea quarks @xcite .",
    "the @xmath222 is the quantity which describes the @xmath1-dependence of the @xmath173 symmetry breaking of the nucleon sea .",
    "this quantity can not be easily obtained from the integrand of @xmath176 which , in addition to @xmath223 , involves the @xmath1-dependence of valence quark distributions ( see eq.[gottfried ] ) , making the extraction of the interesting quantity rather difficult .",
    "the analysis of dilepton production in @xmath154 and @xmath224 collisions seems to be much better in this respect @xcite .",
    "@xmath225 is of special importance since it can be used to verify our model as it does not require further parameters .",

    "we can not allow for variation of the remaining parameters ( @xmath311 , @xmath314 , @xmath317 , @xmath318 ) , because a completely unrestricted fit could result in unphysical values of parameters since the number of experimental data points is limited to only 5 .    in order to demonstrate the effect of different fock components we present in table 5 the axial - vector coupling constants @xmath28 calculated with the inclusion of intermediate pseudoscalar mesons and octet baryons @xmath327 , with the additional inclusion of decuplet baryons @xmath328 and with the additional inclusion of vector mesons @xmath329 . in the case of the @xmath3 axial coupling constants ( eq . [ su6coup ] ) the inclusion of pseudoscalar mesons ",
    "octet baryons fock components improves the quality of the fit to the experimental @xmath28 s in comparison to nqm ( see the @xmath325 values in the last row of the table ) tremendously .",
    "the additional inclusion of intermediate decuplet baryons deteriorates the fit , increasing the @xmath325 value . in this context",
    "it is worth mentioning that the contribution of the octet - decuplet interference terms to the axial - vector coupling constant for neutron beta - decay @xmath330 obtained in our calculation is much smaller than in the cloudy bag model@xcite . adding vector mesons",
    "again improves the fit to the experimental axial - vector coupling constants .",
    "summarizing , taking into account both pseudoscalar and vector meson corrections does not lead to any significant deviations from the experimental data for semileptonic decays .",
    "the quality of the fit is comparable to that of the original cabibbo model .",
    "therefore , the experimental data for semileptonic decays does not contradict the meson cloud model of the nucleon , which one might naively expect .",
    "we do not predict any essential difference between the @xmath10 cabibbo model and our model for any so far unmeasured transitions .",
    "the meson radiative corrections were recently calculated in the framework of baryon chiral perturbation theory including pseudoscalar mesons with both intermediate baryon octet @xcite and decuplet @xcite components . in order to simplify the calculation",
    "the baryon fields were treated there as heavy static fermions . although the details of the calculation in refs.@xcite differ from ours , similar conclusions have been drawn . in comparison",
    "to refs.@xcite , where the experimental error bars where increased in calculating their @xmath325 values , our agreement with the data is much better .",
    "if we increase the error bars as in refs.@xcite we would get @xmath331 of the order of 0.1 - 0.4 , compared to @xmath332 in refs.@xcite .",
    "in section ii we discussed how the matrix elements of axial currents of the dressed nucleon are related to the corresponding matrix elements of the constituents ( intermediate baryons and mesons ) in the convolution approach . eq.([currents ] ) allows one to relate axial current matrix elements to quark polarizations .",
    "then the ellis - jaffe sum rule can be expressed in terms of axial - vector matrix elements @xmath270 , @xmath333 and @xmath334 ( eq . [ currents ] ) @xmath335 in the same way the bjorken sum rule becomes @xmath336 dx = { 1\\over3}\\delta q_3\\ ] ] which can be expressed in terms of the axial - vector coupling constant for neutron beta decay @xmath337    practical calculation of axial - vector matrix elements ( see eq .",
    "[ axial ] ) requires additional assumptions about the axial properties of the bare particles .",
    "we will assume @xmath338 for all non - strange bare particles , which is an extension of the original ellis - jaffe ansatz @xmath339 @xcite .",
    "in analogy to the previous section we will consider two models : the @xmath3 model , with axial coupling constants given by eq.([su6coup ] ) and the @xmath10 model with @xmath265 and @xmath266 fitted to the semileptonic data .",
    "in table 6 we present our results for the ellis - jaffe sum rule for the proton @xmath9 , the ellis - jaffe sum rule for the neutron @xmath340 , the bjorken sum rule @xmath341 and @xmath270 in both models with different fock states included : ( a ) tree level , ( b ) octet baryons and pseudoscalar mesons @xmath327 , ( c ) octet and decuplet baryons and pseudoscalar mesons ( @xmath342 ) and ( d ) the same with an additional inclusion of vector mesons ( @xmath343 ) .    in the case of the @xmath3 model inclusion of the @xmath327 fock states",
    "brings the bare @xmath3 value of @xmath344 for the proton ellis - jaffe sum rule almost half way down to the experimental result @xcite .",
    "inclusion of the intermediate decuplet baryons enhances @xmath9 a little bit , and conversely the addition of vector mesons decreases @xmath9 slightly .",
    "even with the inclusion of all fock states we are not able to describe the experimental emc result for @xmath9 .",
    "it would be , however , too naive to expect that our model alone can account for all spin problems ; other effects , like the famous axial anomaly ( see section v ) , should be present as well .",
    "currently it is , however , very difficult to give a quantitative estimate of the axial anomaly effect . on the purely phenomenological side one could try to map the @xmath1 dependence of the axial anomaly contribution to @xmath345 by ascribing all the deficiencies of the existing models with respect to the experimental data to the axial anomaly",
    ". then one can write @xmath346 where @xmath347 is the contribution of the axial anomaly .",
    "in ref.@xcite the unknown contribution was ascribed to the deficiency of the mit bag model .",
    "such an estimate of the axial anomaly must rely on the model calculation of @xmath348 and @xmath349 . in the present paper we have concentrated on the role of mesonic corrections ,",
    "therefore considered only very simple models of the bare nucleons ( baryons ) .",
    "it has been shown very recently @xcite that by combining the mesonic effects calculated according to the present paper together with one version of the adelaide group bag model @xcite an impressive agreement with the emc @xcite and the slac @xcite data can be obtained at @xmath350 .",
    "the meson cloud scenario leaves therefore much less phenomenological room for the axial anomaly contribution , at least at @xmath350 .",
    "there is still some room left at @xmath351 , i.e. precisely in the region where the gluonic contribution is expected to play an important role @xcite .",
    "the bjorken sum rule is independent of the anomaly .",
    "here we get a good agreement with the classical value eq.([bjorken ] ) ( without qcd corrections ) when including only intermediate octet baryons with pseudoscalar mesons as well as in the full model . in this context",
    "the similarity to the gottfried sum rule is worth noting . in order to compare @xmath341 with the experimental results of the slac and smc experiments ( see lower panel of table 6 ) , higher order perturbative corrections have to be included @xcite .",
    "perturbative qcd corrections to the bjorken sum rule have been calculated up to @xmath352 @xcite @xmath353.\\ ] ] in the case of the slac experiment also higher twist effects probably play an important role @xcite .",
    "once higher - order perturbative corrections are taken into account we get a good agreement with the result of the smc analysis which include all available proton and deuteron data @xcite .",
    "the classical @xmath3 model is attractive due to its simplicity . in practice , in order to describe different data it is necessary to break this symmetry and allow @xmath265 and @xmath266 to be fitted to the semileptonic decay data .",
    "we also follow this line here .",
    "then we get @xmath9 closer to the experimental emc result with the best result when only intermediate octet baryons and pseudoscalar mesons are included . in this case",
    "@xmath340 becomes negative , which seems to be the case experimentally @xcite .",
    "of course the bjorken sum rule is fulfilled here in all cases , which is due to the relation between @xmath341 and neutron beta decay constant @xmath354 ( eq . [ bjorken ] ) .",
    "also the calculated ellis - jaffe sum rule has to be corrected for perturbative qcd effects .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the singlet ( @xmath355 ) and the non - singlet ( @xmath356 ) contributions to the integral of the ellis - jaffe sum rule get different corrections @xmath357 for example for @xmath358 @xmath359 calculated within our model ( see table 6 ) is reduced : @xmath360 @xmath361 and @xmath362 @xmath363 . here",
    "we have taken @xmath364 @xcite .",
    "although substantial , the pqcd corrections does not allow to bring our results down to the experimental @xmath359 .    in all models considered ,",
    "the singlet axial matrix element @xmath365 and @xmath273 are far from the one obtained from the emc analysis ( ! ) @xcite .",
    "we have stressed the word analysis , as the emc result is biased by the assumption of the @xmath10 symmetry .",
    "since our model violates @xmath10 symmetry , @xmath366 does not need to coincide with the value extracted by the emc . in our model",
    "@xmath270 is reduced mainly due to the @xmath79 fock state admixture , which causes a partial depolarization of the spin as discussed in refs.@xcite .",
    "the depolarization is caused by a cancellation of the spin - preserving and spin - flipping contributions to the @xmath79 fock state .",
    "please note that our model predicts @xmath367 in contrast to the negative value found from the emc analysis . in the constituent quark models the nucleon does not contain any internal strangeness and as a consequence @xmath368 because @xmath369 is known to be an almost pure @xmath370 state .",
    "this is also the case of the so - called @xmath3 related coupling constants @xcite which we have used throughout this paper .",
    "however , @xmath369 could couple to the nucleon through @xmath371 very much the same as the @xmath21 meson couples to the nucleon via @xmath372 @xcite . due to its structure",
    "the @xmath369 meson could be a good candidate to understand the problem of the `` missing '' polarized strangeness . to estimate a maximal possible effect of @xmath369 we have taken @xmath373 from the vector meson dominance model @xcite .",
    "then we get extra @xmath374 , which is rather small and of opposite sign to the `` experimental '' @xmath273 .",
    "in the light of recent experiments on the deep - inelastic lepton scattering by nucleons , the understanding of the nucleon structure has become a hot topic in particle and nuclear physics .",
    "the recent observation of gottfried sum rule breaking strongly suggests a flavour asymmetry of light sea quarks in the nucleon .",
    "the asymmetry occurs in a natural way within the meson cloud model .",
    "the meson cloud model , as in any phenomenological model , requires specification of some external parameters which can not be calculated at the present time from a more microscopic theory . analysis of the model over the past few years has shown that the results are rather sensitive to these parameters . at the present stage",
    ", it seems to be impossible to derive these parameters from the underlying qcd . in the present paper",
    "we have tried to set limits on these parameters by applying the model to high - energy baryon production data .",
    "the application of the mcm to these reactions is consistent with its application to the nucleon structure . in practical calculations",
    "one has to make an ansatz for the vertex form factors .",
    "it was argued @xcite that one should use form factors which guarantee certain symmetries of the longitudinal momentum distribution functions of virtual mesons and baryons . in the present work we followed this approach .",
    "in contrast to form factors often used in traditional nuclear physics calculations , the symmetric form factors give a good description of the experimental data .",
    "we find an universal cut - off parameter for all fock states involving octet baryons .",
    "this leads to important differences in comparison to other calculations , where universality has been assumed for the @xmath18-dependent form factors .",
    "after we had fixed the parameters of the vertex form factors in the hadronic sector , we have looked at the consequences in unpolarized and polarized deep - inelastic scattering and for the semileptonic decays .",
    "we find a few interesting results .",
    "the value of the gottfried sum rule obtained from our model ( @xmath375 ) is in good agreement with the experimental result obtained by nmc ( @xmath183 ) .",
    "the meson cloud model predicts a @xmath376 asymmetry concentrated at rather small @xmath1 in impressive agreement with a recent global fit to the world data on the drell - yan and dis @xcite .    since in our model the probability of the strange meson  strange baryon fock components",
    "is substantially reduced in comparison to the non - strange counterparts , we obtain a significant reduction of the strange sea quark distributions .",
    "we find @xmath377 in contrast to the customary assumption @xmath378 .",
    "the effect found is small and differs from naive expectations .",
    "the mesonic corrections lead to renormalization of axial - vector current matrix elements .",
    "large one - loop corrections , which explicitly violate @xmath10 symmetry , are in surprisingly good agreement with semileptonic data even with @xmath3 axial coupling constants for bare particles .    we find that a significant fraction ( 20% ) of the nucleon spin is carried by the angular momentum of the mesonic cloud .",
    "although the meson cloud model does not reproduce completely the emc result for the ellis - jaffe sum rule , the contribution of the meson cloud can not be neglected in the total balance of the proton spin , especially in the context of the success of the meson cloud in the explanation of the gottfried sum rule violation and @xmath379 asymmetry .",
    "the presence of higher fock components seems , however , not sufficient to resolve the spin crisis . here",
    ", probably other effects , to mention only the axial anomaly , play an important role .    summarizing , in our view",
    "the meson cloud model has many attractive features and can account for the description of many experimental data . here , we have discussed only some aspects .",
    "it should be mentioned that this picture of the nucleon provides , in addition , a good description of nucleon electric polarizabilities @xcite and that it has a close connection to very successful models of low - energy hadron - hadron scattering @xcite .",
    "finally we want to point out that the same model ( with the same set of parameters which has been determined from quite different phenomena ) turned out to be very successful @xcite in the description of the new na51 cern data for the dilepton production in the proton - proton and proton - deuteron collisions @xcite .",
    "the model provides also a good description of the production of slow protons on the `` neutron '' ( extracted from the deuteron target @xcite ) in the charge - current neutrino and antineutrino dis reactions @xcite .",
    "the model discussed here gives also unique predictions for the semi - inclusive dis @xmath380 which will be tested soon at hera @xcite .",
    "such a measurement is being prepared by the zeus collaboration which is installing the forward neutron calorimeter @xcite . a pilot experiment on detecting neutrons from the beam - gas interactions",
    "has already been performed and the result is in good agreement with the pion - exchange predictions @xcite . like any model , the meson cloud model requires further testing . in this respect",
