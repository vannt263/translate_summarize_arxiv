    "the kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) instability is a basic hydrodynamic phenomenon in sheared flows  @xcite .",
    "magnetic fields can strongly influence the linear and non - linear behavior of this instability .",
    "a recent full parameter study  @xcite ( paper i ) of the growth and saturation of the kh instability in two - dimensional ( 2d ) compressible magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) augmented the vast body of knowledge on magnetically induced effects  @xcite .",
    "it illustrated how a weak , uniform @xmath0 field gets amplified by the developing vortical flow and how this in turn changes the redistribution of mass as compared to pure hydrodynamic cases .",
    "figure  [ f-2d ] , taken from paper i , shows a close - up of the density pattern after four transverse sound travel times in a magnetically modified kh evolution .",
    "parameter values are listed below in section  [ ss - iv ] .",
    "the magnetic field becomes dynamically dominant at the time shown , halting the further growth in the transverse @xmath1-direction .",
    "the @xmath2-direction is periodic , so fig .",
    "[ f-2d ] shows alternating regions of density enhancements ( bright ) and depletions ( dark ) .",
    "the narrow lanes of low density intersecting the high density regions signal sites of strong magnetic fields .",
    "the kh instability is important for numerous astrophysical applications .",
    "shear flows occur in jets ejected from star forming regions , in stellar winds , in winds emanating from accretion disks ,  many of the jet - type astrophysical flows are at such high speeds that the dominant dynamics is through shock interaction both internal to the jet and at its leading working surface where the jet penetrates the ambient plasma .",
    "the fundamental shear - induced instabilities that can develop at the jet surface are ultimately responsible for entrainment and mixing with the ambient material .",
    "recently , bodo _ et al . _",
    "@xcite performed comparative 2d and 3d hydrodynamic simulations of supersonic ( mach 10 ) jets . in their 3d simulations of a jet ,",
    "10 times less dense than its environment , faster decay into small - scale structure was demonstrated , as well as strong mixing with the external medium .",
    "the evolution was governed by the formation of internal shocks , induced external shocks , and consequent momentum and material mixing processes .",
    "usually , the initial perturbation in 2d and 3d studies of this kind consists of a superposition of all linear wave modes , mimicking the dynamics resulting from random excitations .",
    "it is then very difficult to disentangle what causes the separate modes to couple .",
    "therefore , we take a different approach and perturb at selected mode pairs .",
    "our aim is to clearly identify cause and effect in the non - linear dynamics .",
    "typically , highly collimated jets are seen as bipolar outflows from young stellar objects .",
    "it is generally believed that the magnetic field plays an as yet not fully understood role in this collimation .",
    "insights from 2d simulations have been carried over to 2.5 dimensions  @xcite .",
    "numerical , fully three - dimensional calculations of astrophysical phenomena involving shear flow and magnetic fields consider mhd simulations of relativistic jets in aligned  @xcite and oblique magnetic fields  @xcite , and have focused on density effects in poloidally magnetized supermagnetosonic jets  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these studies where the long - term coherence of the jet is of interest , we assess initial transient features and the way in which lorentz forces can saturate and control the jet deformation and breakup .",
    "we highlight this role played by magnetic fields in a simple cylindrical jet configuration with a uniform field parallel to the shear flow .",
    "our study of 3d jets looks at these magnetic effects in the subsonic kelvin - helmholtz unstable regime .",
    "we concentrate on the three - dimensional non - linear hydrodynamic and magnetic effects . due to the large computational cost required for 3d simulations , we restrict ourselves to two cases which are an immediate 3d generalization of the 2d case shown in figure  [ f-2d ] .",
    "the governing parameters  @xcite are chosen such that ( i ) the magnetic field is weak initially , allowing the hydrodynamic kelvin - helmholtz instability to develop ; and ( ii ) the shear flow strength corresponds to its most unstable value in 2d in the sense that the saturation level is highest at fixed axial mode number .",
    "this axial wave number is taken close to , but slightly below the most unstable linear mode from the 2d case . by setting the mode number in the azimuthal direction we can investigate the influence of the three - dimensional geometry .    in this parameter regime",
    ", we can simulate the dynamics using two entirely different numerical tools : the general finite - volume based versatile advection code ( vac  @xcite ) , and the combined finite - difference , spectral code heating by resonant absorption ( hera  @xcite ) . while the latter is designed for magnetized loop dynamics involving strong radial gradients only ,",
    "the former offers a choice of high - order , shock - capturing schemes typically used in computational fluid dynamics calculations .",
    "of these two codes , only vac is able to investigate the supersonic regime relevant for astrophysical jets . in this combined vac - hera study of the subsonic regime",
    ", we not only verify both codes against eachother , but also get additional insight in the various spectral contributions to the dynamics .",
    "the mhd equations , initial conditions , and the numerical tools used are discussed in section  [ s - eq ] .",
    "we limit the discussion of the non - linear dynamics to two cases that only differ in the perturbation applied to the kh unstable jet .",
    "section  [ s - dynamics ] contains a detailed analysis of their saturation behavior and illustrates the role played by the magnetic field .",
    "we briefly comment on the further evolution .",
    "conclusions are presented in section  [ s - concl ] .",
    "the ideal mhd equations constitute a set of conservation laws .",
    "the eight partial differential equations govern the time evolution of mass density @xmath3 , momentum density @xmath4 , total energy density @xmath5 , and magnetic induction @xmath0 . written in these conservative variables ,",
    "we get @xmath6 @xmath7=0,\\ ] ] @xmath8 @xmath9 we introduced @xmath10 as the total pressure , and @xmath11 as the identity tensor .",
    "the thermal pressure @xmath12 is related to the energy density as @xmath13 .",
    "we set the adiabatic gas constant @xmath14 equal to @xmath15 .",
    "magnetic units are defined such that the magnetic permeability is unity .",
    "the numerical 3d time - dependent calculation of the kelvin - helmholtz instability in magnetized plasma jets is done twice with two completely independent software tools , the versatile advection code ( vac  @xcite ) , and the heating by resonant absorption code ( hera  @xcite ) .",
    "detailed descriptions of the algorithms employed in these codes are found through the references , here we only highlight the differences .",
    "vac is more general in terms of algorithms  @xcite , applications  @xcite , and geometry , while hera is truly specialized to the solution of the 3d mhd equations in cylindrical geometry  @xcite .",
    "both codes run on vector and distributed memory architectures , and their implementation and performance aspects are detailed elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the vac and hera results in this paper were obtained on a shared memory vector cray c90 and on 16 processors of the cray t3e and ibm sp .",
    "vac employs a finite volume discretization on a structured grid , while hera uses finite differences in the radial direction , and a 2d spectral @xmath16 representation in the azimuthal direction ( @xmath17 ) and along the cylinder ( @xmath18 ) . in vac , we selected the explicit , one - step total variation diminishing scheme  @xcite with _ woodward",
    "_ limiting  @xcite .",
    "this scheme makes use of a roe - type approximate riemann solver  @xcite .",
    "the conservation form of the mhd equations is taken and ensured by this discretization .",
    "hera uses a semi - implicit predictor - corrector time stepping algorithm  @xcite and advances the primitive variables @xmath3 , @xmath19 , @xmath12 , and @xmath0 . the discrete equivalent of @xmath20 is ensured in vac by applying a projection scheme at every time step  @xcite using an efficient iterative method .",
    "hera instead uses a staggered radial mesh , which allows to encode a discretization that keeps the field divergence identically zero . for the hera calculations reported in section  [ s - dynamics ] , we use a stabilizing ` artificial viscosity ' term @xmath21 added to the momentum equation , with @xmath22 .",
    "for the resolutions used in the calculations , this turns out to be roughly at the order of the numerical dissipation inherent to the scheme used from vac .",
    "the 3d jet configuration generalizes the 2d simulation shown in figure  [ f-2d ] .",
    "this calculation started from a uniform density @xmath23 , pressure @xmath24 and magnetic field @xmath25 parallel to a shear flow of the form @xmath26 .",
    "the initial plasma beta was @xmath27 , and this 2d reference case is further characterized by the dimensionless sound mach number @xmath28 ( ratio of the shear flow amplitude to the sound speed ) and alfvn mach number @xmath29 ( ratio of shear flow amplitude to the alfvn speed ) .",
    "our previous study in two space dimensions  @xcite showed that for these parameters , the non - linear saturation level is maximal at the chosen sound mach number for the mode with wave number @xmath30 .",
    "therefore we apply a perturbation to the shear flow according to @xmath31 .    in 3d , we consider a jet - like flow .",
    "using @xmath32 cylindrical coordinates , we set up a flow field @xmath33 parallel to a cylinder of length @xmath34 and radius @xmath35 , which is sheared in the radial direction .",
    "note that the jet surface @xmath36 is easily identified as the @xmath37 isosurface .",
    "the strength of the velocity shear is fixed at @xmath38 , and the width of the shear layer is @xmath39 exactly like in the reference 2d case .",
    "further , the initial pressure @xmath40 and density @xmath41 are equal to unity everywhere , and we impose a uniform initial field @xmath42 parallel to the jet . taking @xmath43 , we have a 3d configuration with identical properties as the reference kh unstable 2d case  @xcite shown in fig .",
    "we perturb the cylindrical jet surface by imposing a radial velocity profile @xmath44 hence , we impose a perturbation at specific mode numbers @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "this does represent a truly 3d perturbation , as it translates into the simultaneous excitation of four 2d fourier modes ( [ q - spectral ] ) , namely @xmath47 with complex amplitude @xmath48 , @xmath49 with amplitude @xmath50 , and similarly for the @xmath51 modes ( since the velocity is a purely real quantity ) .",
    "these symmetry considerations will allow us to refer to @xmath52 mode pairs with always @xmath53 and @xmath54 , tacitly assuming the @xmath55 individual mode contributions .",
    "the amplitude of the perturbation is fixed at @xmath56 and its radial width is chosen to be @xmath57 .",
    "we calculate the evolution of the kh unstable jet with both vac and hera .",
    "for vac , we set up the jet configuration in a cartesian @xmath58 box of sizes @xmath59 .",
    "note the difference between the cartesian @xmath60 and the cylindrical @xmath18-direction .",
    "in fact , the first , periodic @xmath2-dimension is now along the jet .",
    "we assume outflow boundary conditions on the sides parallel to the jet .",
    "we take @xmath34 and an aspect ratio of @xmath61 .",
    "we use @xmath62 equidistant grid points .    for hera , the jet is placed within a co - axial cylinder of radius @xmath63 .",
    "we took @xmath64 radial grid points , and 32 modes both in the @xmath17 and @xmath18 dimensions .",
    "hera naturally assumes periodic boundary conditions along ( @xmath18-direction ) and about ( @xmath17-direction ) the loop , while a regularity condition holds at @xmath65 .",
    "we took a closed , perfectly conducting wall at the outer radius , which is the only difference in the problem setup between vac and hera .",
    "all calculations reported below are not ( yet ) influenced by this difference in ` open box ' versus ` closed cylinder ' outer boundary configuration .",
    "figure  [ f - vachera ] shows the time evolution of the scaled poloidal kinetic and magnetic energies from both calculations when we perturb at mode numbers @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "these are volume integrated quantities , namely @xmath68 and similarly @xmath69 and they allow a determination of the growth rate and the saturation behavior of the instability . note that the difference in the total volume of the simulated box ( vac ) or cylinder ( hera ) does not make a difference for these volume integrals since the functions are zero far from the jet surface .",
    "the agreement between the finite volume based vac code and the pseudo - spectral hera code is excellent : the growth and saturation behavior is clearly captured at about @xmath70 .",
    "the spectral code allows us to identify the contributions of all linear wave numbers @xmath52 at any particular moment in time .",
    "the contributions to the poloidal magnetic energy of the most dominant wave numbers are indicated in the figure .",
    "we immediately read off how the @xmath71 perturbations induce @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 modes , in that order . these couple and",
    "reverse their original ordering at @xmath75 . at saturation @xmath70 ,",
    "the three most important mode number pairs are the excited @xmath71 and the induced @xmath76 and @xmath72 modes .",
    "note that , interestingly , the @xmath77 modes with @xmath78 of similar helicity as the excited @xmath71 mode never play an important role during and beyond the saturation phase , at least not for @xmath79 .",
    "this is in spite of the fact that they are excited fairly early on in the growth phase of the instability : the @xmath73 modes enter in the quasi - linear regime for @xmath80 ( see figure  [ f - vachera ] ) , and @xmath81 , @xmath82 ,  pairs are among the first excited wave numbers . for times",
    "@xmath79 , they never amount to a significant contribution to the total poloidal magnetic energy .    while we now know which mode numbers are dominating the dynamics at any particular time , it remains to identify what causes their various couplings . in what follows ,",
    "we sketch the physical mechanisms which trigger individual modes during the growth and saturation phase of the 3d kh instability",
    ". it should be clear that the _ combined _ finite volume and spectral calculations led us to a fairly detailed insight in the intricate non - linear dynamics .",
    "first , we can make some analytic predictions for times earlier than @xmath83 , where the behavior is essentially ` quasi - linear ' .",
    "since the initial plasma beta is high , @xmath84 , we can neglect magnetic effects altogether during this phase .",
    "we employ a cylindrical coordinate system @xmath32 centered on the jet .",
    "the total velocity field can be written as a sum of the equilibrium shear flow , the imposed radial velocity perturbation , and an induced small velocity perturbation as follows : @xmath85 we then analyse the linear and most dominant non - linear effects in a pure hydrodynamic description . on the jet surface @xmath36 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 . in the vicinity of this jet surface",
    ", we can safely assume that @xmath88 is constant .",
    "we start from the hydrodynamic equations , written in cylindrical coordinates , and employ primitive variables @xmath3 , @xmath12 , and @xmath19 . the continuity equation in cylindrical coordinates is @xmath89   =   0 .",
    "\\label{q - rho1}\\ ] ] using expression  ( [ q - vel ] ) , writing @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and evaluating at @xmath36 , we get : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the sound speed for the unperturbed configuration .",
    "hence , the linear pressure perturbation on the jet surface , in phase with the density perturbation , follows immediately from the non - vanishing radial divergence of the imposed perturbation through the term @xmath94 .",
    "all other terms in equation  ( [ q - rho1 ] ) lead to @xmath95 contributions , which enter the dynamics later .    in the @xmath17-component of the momentum equation ,",
    "@xmath96 the dominant term at @xmath36 is the linearly induced pressure gradient in the @xmath17-direction , so using  ( [ q - p ] ) we get : @xmath97 similarly , the longitudinal velocity @xmath98-component at @xmath36 is dominated by purely linear effects , but it has two distinct contributions .",
    "the full equation is @xmath99 again , the induced pressure gradient term along @xmath18 contributes , but now also the shear in the background flow profile has a linear term associated with it , such that @xmath100 so far , all terms considered are purely linear .",
    "the quasi - linear effects enter by a consideration of the equation for the radial velocity , @xmath101 close to the jet surface , the appropriate ordering of terms becomes @xmath102 the non - linear effects arise from the @xmath103 terms .",
    "we can approximate  ( [ q - vr1 ] ) , using the linear terms in the expressions  ( [ q - p ] ) ,  ( [ q - vphi ] ) and  ( [ q - vz ] ) , as @xmath104   \\nonumber \\\\    & - & t^2 ( \\delta v_r)^2 \\frac{c^2_0}{2 r_{jet } }    \\left[\\frac{4\\pi^2}{l^2}\\cos^2{\\varphi}\\cos^2\\frac{2\\pi z}{l }    + \\frac{1}{r^2_{jet}}\\sin^2{\\varphi}\\sin^2\\frac{2\\pi z}{l}\\right ]    + { \\cal o}\\left\\{t^4 ( \\delta v_r)^2\\right\\ }   \\nonumber \\\\ \\label{q - vr2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , the @xmath71 excitation leads to @xmath72 , @xmath73 contributions in the quasi - linear regime . the third term in expression  ( [ q - vr2 ] )",
    "has a @xmath74 effect in it as well , since @xmath105 .",
    "the quasi - linear analytic reasoning thus validates the observed ordering in time in the first - excited linear mode numbers as seen in fig .",
    "[ f - vachera ] . at the same time",
    ", we identified the physical effects that cause their excitation .      beyond this quasi - linear phase , the physical interpretation of various non - linear coupling events",
    "must be guided by the numerical solutions calculated with both codes .",
    "following fig .",
    "[ f - vachera ] , it remains to identify why , in addition to the excited @xmath71 modes , the @xmath106 and @xmath107 wave numbers govern the dynamics at the time of saturation at @xmath108 .",
    "moreover , the influence of the magnetic field needs to be discussed .",
    "this is best illustrated using the picture gallery shown in fig .",
    "[ f - t4 ] .    the first frame a shows the density perturbation at @xmath70 in a horizontal cutting plane through the jet axis .",
    "the sinusoidal , sideways @xmath71 displacement of the jet essentially reduces to a ` doubled ' 2d simulation in this plane . indeed , at each of both intersections with the jet surface we created initial conditions much like those used for the 2d result shown at saturation in fig .",
    "the 3d result shows that the basic features are unaltered : vortical flow has redistributed mass along the direction of the jet in periodic depletions ( dark regions ) and enhancements ( bright ) . at the center of those regions where mass is accumulated ,",
    "a narrow lane of low - density is formed which coincides with high magnetic fields , as the field gets entrained and compressed by the global plasma circulation .",
    "there is a significant difference with the 2d result , namely that the positioning of the resulting saturation pattern is shifted along the jet axis . in the pure 2d simulation from fig .",
    "[ f-2d ] , the induced vertical pressure gradient @xmath109 is in phase with the initial vertical velocity perturbation @xmath110 .",
    "the shear background flow introduces a force within the shear layer which is purely along the @xmath2-direction .",
    "the quasi - linear analytic treatment presented above clearly shows in equation  ( [ q - vz ] ) how an extra pressure gradient term , out of phase with the imposed velocity perturbation , enters the description . as a result , the observed axial shift of the pattern ensues .",
    "frame b in fig .",
    "[ f - t4 ] shows the same horizontal cut in a 3d view of the simulation domain , and a specific high - density isosurface where @xmath111 .",
    "the actual range in density is now @xmath112 $ ] .",
    "note how the high density zones appear as two ` banana'-shaped surfaces at diagonally opposing positions with respect to the center of the box .",
    "the density perturbation is thus clearly dominated by a @xmath71 mode number pair .",
    "the enhanced density regions coincide with zones of excess pressure , according to equation  ( [ q - rho ] ) .",
    "this is best demonstrated by visualizing the jet surface @xmath113 , and coloring it with its local thermal pressure .",
    "this is done in frame c of the picture gallery .",
    "note the diametrically opposing high pressure zones ( bright ) in the same location as the high density regions , and similarly for the low pressure ( or density ) regions along the other diagonal .",
    "for the particular aspect ratio of the simulated jet , the resulting poloidal pressure gradient in the @xmath17-direction on the jet surface has induced a particular poloidal flow pattern on top and bottom of the jet surface .",
    "this flow essentially wraps the high pressure regions around top and bottom of the jet surface , thereby invading the low pressure zones .",
    "this occurs along the positive @xmath1-direction in the front half of the jet , and along the negative @xmath1-direction at the back half .",
    "this effectively doubles the axial mode number @xmath46 of the perturbation along top and bottom of the jet . if we make a vertical cut through the density structure containing the jet axis , as in frame d of fig .",
    "[ f - t4 ] , an induced @xmath107 kh perturbation is clearly visible .",
    "so far , the role of the magnetic field is not fully explained .",
    "however , at saturation @xmath70 , the plasma beta is locally reduced to @xmath114 from the initially uniform @xmath84 , while the alfvnic mach number @xmath115 is as low as @xmath116 .",
    "magnetic effects can no longer be ignored .",
    "the induced flow pattern causing the excitation of a @xmath107 kh perturbation at top and bottom of the jet also entrails the field lines .",
    "frame e in figure  [ f - t4 ] shows the @xmath117 isosurfaces of the squared poloidal magnetic field strength , which was zero at @xmath118 .",
    "these are cospatial with the strongest total magnetic field zones , and four distinct regions are visible : two sheet - like structures at the positions where the density is enhanced , and two curly fibril structures along top and bottom of the jet .",
    "the sheet structures are the immediate 3d generalization of the low - density , high - field lanes visible in the 2d calculation shown in fig .",
    "note how they coincide with a central low - density zone within the ` banana ' high density isosurface from frame b. the fibril structures are high field regions built up by the induced flow pattern around top and bottom of the jet , discussed earlier .",
    "they coincide with low pressure , low density regions with a similar 3d curved shape .",
    "in fact , the vertical cut of the density structure from frame d contains three intersections of the actual 3d low density fibril at each jet crossing . just as in 2d ,",
    "the magnetic field has become locally dominant in the dynamics , and thereby saturates the instability and controls the further evolution .",
    "the final frame illustrates this clearly , where we now visualize the velocity field in a vertical cut perpendicular to the jet axis at @xmath119 .",
    "the arrows indicate the poloidal velocity field , and a clear circulation is seen about the high field fibrils .",
    "the contours of the @xmath2-component of vorticity are also showing the same effect .",
    "the thick solid line is the @xmath113 jet surface , which has a clear @xmath106 perturbation in it .",
    "hence , the thermal pressure and the magnetic field cooperate to induce @xmath107 and @xmath106 contributions that dominate the saturation behavior along with the @xmath71 initial disturbance .",
    "the resulting density variation in three space dimensions is shown in fig .",
    "[ f - rhot4 ] , and can now be interpreted from the preceding exposition .",
    "figure  [ f - vachera2 ] shows the development and saturation behavior of the kh unstable jet , when the initial excitation has a @xmath121 variation .",
    "figure  [ f - rhot4m2 ] gives a 3d impression of the density variation at @xmath70 for this case , and there is significant fine structure in all spatial directions .",
    "the information on the excitation and coupling events between linear modes can again be extracted directly from the hera calculation , and used for the physical interpretation of the non - linear dynamics .",
    "a quasi - linear description , completely analogous to the one for @xmath66 , predicts the initial excitation of the @xmath72 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 modes .",
    "the later evolution and saturation is dominated by the imposed @xmath124 and the excited @xmath123 mode pair .",
    "the discussion of the simpler @xmath66 case in terms of pressure - gradient induced effects and the role of the magnetic field can be carried over to the present configuration .",
    "note that the initial @xmath124 perturbation leads to four distinct zones where flows converge , building up high density , high pressure regions . instead of the two diagonally opposing regions as shown in frame b of figure  [ f - t4 ] , we now have two regions in the front half of the jet @xmath125 , and two in the back half @xmath126 .",
    "the front two are at the top and the bottom of the jet , with the back ones at the left and right edge .",
    "figure  [ f - rhot4m2 ] shows three of the enhanced density zones ( bright ) using various cutting planes through the simulation box at @xmath70 . as a result of the associated pressure variations about the jet surface , flows",
    "are set up which again entrail magnetic field lines . as a direct generalization of frame e in figure  [ f - t4 ] ,",
    "one ends up with sheets of high magnetic fields intersecting the four compression zones , and a set of four fibril structures curled in between these zones as a secondary effect from the pressure induced flows .",
    "the effects on the density structure are well represented in figure  [ f - rhot4m2 ] .",
    "values range from @xmath127 to @xmath128 .",
    "the evolution beyond the non - linear saturation is governed by many more mode numbers , as clearly seen in figures  [ f - vachera]-[f - vachera2 ] .",
    "the regions where the magnetic field dominates essentially break up the jet , as identified by its @xmath113 isosurface .",
    "a transition to more turbulent flow sets in , but quantitative statements about this transition would require higher resolution 3d studies .",
    "these must assess the role played by numerical dissipation , not only in the way it affects the momentum evolution ( viscous effects ) , but also in the developing fine - scale magnetic field ( through resistive studies ) . a combined approach , like the simultaneous finite volume and spectral calculations presented here , will certainly help in sorting out physics from possible numerical artefacts .",
    "both the @xmath66 and the @xmath120 case study concentrated on the growth and saturation phase of kh unstable sheared magnetized jets .",
    "for the chosen parameters , a detailed account of the non - linear excitation of several @xmath52 2d fourier modes was presented .",
    "the combined finite volume and spectral calculations allowed for an in - depth analysis of the physical mechanisms behind non - linear mode couplings . the initially weak magnetic field could be ignored to make analytic predictions about the initial excitation of several mode pairs during the quasi - linear phase .",
    "the field eventually becomes locally dominant , and controls the 3d density structure at saturation . at the particular aspect ratio @xmath61",
    ", we saw how an @xmath129 kink perturbation of the jet leads to a secondary kh instability , characterized by an axial @xmath107 wave number , along top and bottom of the jet .",
    "the induced poloidal pressure gradient triggers this instability .",
    "the magnetic field gets compressed in narrow sheets that intersect @xmath71 compression zones , and in 3d fibrils due to these secondary kh flows .",
    "these , in turn , cause an @xmath106 deformation of the jet surface .",
    "similar effects were present in the @xmath130 case study .    clearly , the initial plasma beta , the strength of the shear flow , and the aspect ratio of the jet all play an important role in this process .",
    "a detailed parameter study should explore their influence , along the lines of previous 2d studies  @xcite .",
    "the particular choice of parameter values used here ( subsonic , high beta ) could occur in the lower atmospheric regions of stars like our sun : the high beta photospheric and chromospheric layers possess a variety of magnetically modified , shear flow regimes .",
    "we can safely speculate that magnetic effects will be important in highly supersonic , extragalactic jets as well .",
    "initially weak fields can become locally dominant , e.g. through shock compression . in turn",
    ", the field may then dictate the type of shock interactions possible to the flow .",
    "future investigations can look at specific geometries ( flaring flux tubes , solar coronal loops ) and adjust field strengths , shear strengths , include gravitation , etc . instead of a uniform , weak @xmath0 field parallel to the jet , the initial magnetic field configuration could contain current sheet(s ) .",
    "it is then possible to investigate tearing unstable situations in conjunction with background shear flows .",
    "such effects have recently been studied in 3d incompressible mhd calculations of a magnetized wake  @xcite for studying the slow component of the solar wind .",
    "the effects of compressibility , which we analyzed for cases whithout initial current sheets , should be quantified in subsequent work .",
