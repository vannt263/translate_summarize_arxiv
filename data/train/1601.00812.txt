    "energy harvesting of heat dissipated from electronic circuits and other heat sources is one of the most important energy issues.[1 ] the realization of such type of energy harvesting typically relies on the search of thermoelectric ( te ) materials with high figure of merits ( @xmath0).[2 ] impressive zt values for quantum - dot superlattices ( qdsl ) systems have been demonstrated experimentally.[3 ] the enhancement of zt mainly arises from the reduction of phonon thermal conductivity in qdsl , which is due to the increased rate of phonon scattering from the interface of quantum dots ( qds).[1,2 ] if the zt value can reach 3 , the solid state cooler will have the potential to replace conventional compressor - based air conditioners owing to its long life time , low noise and low air pollution . besides the search of te devices with large zt value , the optimizing of nonlinear thermoelectric behavior under high temperature bias is crucial for the design of the next - generation energy harvesting engine ( ehe).[1,2 ]    recently , a grate deal of efforts was devoted to the studies of the nonlinear response of thermoelectric devices under high temperature bias .",
    "the nonlinear phonon flow of nanostructures with respect to large temperature bias were investigated experimentally[4 ] and theoretically.[5 - 8 ] the phonon thermal rectification behavior of silicon nanowire ( which has a very low efficiency ) was reported experimentally.[4 ] more recently , the highly efficient electron thermal diode was reported in a superconductor junction system.[9 ] however , such a thermal rectification behavior only exists at very low temperatures . unlike heat rectifiers which are used to control the direction of heat flow [ 4 - 9 ] , the design of an ehe driven by a large temperature bias needs to optimize the efficiency in the energy transfer from the waste heat[1,2 ] . to design a nanoscale ehe , which can be integrated with semiconductor electronic circuits , it is important not only to collect the waste heat but also to improve the performance of electronic circuits .",
    "so far , experimental studies of ehe made of semiconductor qd molecules ( qdms ) have not been reported , mainly due to technical difficulties and the lack of theoretical designs . therefore , it is desirable to have theoretical studies which can provide useful guidelines for the advancement of nanoscale te technology .",
    "most theoretical studies of te properties are limited in the linear response regime.[10 - 13 ] the many - body effect of qdms also presents a big challenge to the development of theoretical studies for te properties . in this article , we study the nonlinear behavior of ehe made of serially coupled triple qds ( sctqds ) based on a previously developed numerically method,[12,13 ] which can suitably address the many body effect in the coulomb blockade regime . in addition , we investigate an engine with direction - dependent electrical output driven by a temperature - bias for application as a novel nonlinear te devices .",

    "<S> the transport of electrons through serially coupled quantum dot molecules ( scqdm ) is investigated theoretically for application as an energy harvesting engine ( ehe ) , which converts thermal heat to electrical power . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the charge current driven by a temperature bias shows bipolar oscillatory behavior with respect to gate voltage due to the unbalance between electrons and holes , which is different from the charge current driven by an applied bias . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we reveal a lenz s law between the charge current and the thermal induced voltage . the efficiency of ehe is higher for scqdm in the orbital depletion situation rather than the orbital filling situation , owing to the many - body effect . </S>",
    "<S> the ehe efficiency is enhanced with increasing temperature bias , but suppressed as the electron hopping strength reduces . </S>",
    "<S> the fluctuation of qd energy levels at different sites also leads to a reduction of ehe efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we demonstrate direction - dependent charge currents driven by the temperature bias for application as a novel charge diode . </S>"
