    "the quest for quasibound antikaon - nuclear states has become a persistently hot topic in nuclear physics .",

    "an experiment performed at kek with stopped @xmath3 on @xmath4he  @xcite seemed to indicate such deeply bound narrow structures .",
    "however , the repetition of this experiment with better statistics  @xcite did not confirm the previously published results . the finuda measurements with stopped @xmath3 on @xmath5li and @xmath6c targets  @xcite suggested an interpretation in terms of quasibound @xmath7 clusters with binding energy @xmath8 mev and width @xmath9 mev",

    "@xcite with the argument that the observed spectrum may be explained by final - state interactions of the produced @xmath10 pairs .",
    "although these issues are unsettled , the experimental search for kaonic nuclei continues vigorously .    calculations of strong binding of antikaons in a nuclear medium based on chiral su(3 ) dynamics have a long history ( see , _",

    "@xcite ) , starting from the early discussions of kaon condensation in dense matter  @xcite .",
    "the recent revival of this theme was prompted by akaishi and yamazaki  @xcite , who used a simple potential model [ unconstrained by chiral su(3 ) ] to calculate bound states of few - body systems such as @xmath7 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "the possibility that such systems could be highly compressed was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , but this was considered  @xcite to be an artifact of an unrealistic nucleon - nucleon interaction being used .",
    "faddeev calculations were performed for @xmath13 with phenomenological input  @xcite , and with a leading - order chiral interaction  @xcite .",
    "both studies found a @xmath7 quasibound state above the @xmath14 threshold with relatively large width .",
    "the @xmath13 system has also been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite by using a variational approach with phenomenological local potentials  @xcite , leading to a bound state at about 50 mev below the @xmath13 threshold .",
    "one should note that the predictive power of all such investigations is limited because the energy range of the @xmath0 interaction relevant for deeply bound kaonic nuclei lies far below the @xmath0 threshold .",

    "it turns out , namely , that the peak position in the @xmath16 mass spectrum is not to be identified with the pole position of the @xmath17 in the @xmath0 amplitude .",
    "thus , naively assigning a @xmath18 binding energy of 27 mev to the @xmath17 , as is frequently done in phenomenological potential approaches , is not justified in view of the strong @xmath19 coupled - channel dynamics . in any event",
    ", we need to extrapolate the interaction calibrated around the @xmath0 threshold down to much lower energies to explore the possible existence of deeply bound @xmath1-nuclear systems .",

    "this potential is generally complex and energy dependent .",

    "there appears to be no prominent resonance structure in this amplitude , but it nevertheless develops a pole in the complex energy plane at @xmath82 the large imaginary part , in spite of the relatively small phase space ( @xmath8350 mev above the threshold ) is a special feature of this @xmath29-wave @xmath16 single - channel resonance .        in the right panel of fig .",

    "thin lines represent the results with the two - channel model ; the results of the full model are also shown as thick lines .",
    "one also observes that the imaginary part of @xmath55 is almost identical in the two - channel and full models .",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "first , the imaginary part of @xmath55 comes only from the loop of the @xmath16 channel @xmath84 in this energy region , when we expand the amplitude .",
    "taking into account the zeros in the coupling strengths @xmath85 , one can show that the difference between @xmath86 and @xmath87 is of the order of @xmath88 $ ] .",
    "however , the magnitude of @xmath89 is roughly estimated as @xmath90 . numerically , the magnitudes of the real and imaginary parts are smaller than 0.7 for the relevant energy region .",

    "[ fig : contribution2 ] , together with the tree - level weinberg - tomozawa term for the @xmath0 channel . by construction of the effective interaction [ eq .  ] , the difference from the tree - level one is attributed to the coupled - channel dynamics . as seen in the figure , the @xmath16 and other coupled channels enhance the strength of the interaction at low energy , although not by a large amount .",
    "the primary difference is seen in the energy dependence of the interaction kernel .",
    "the imaginary part is smaller in magnitude than the real part .",
    "this permits treating the imaginary part perturbatively in the effective @xmath0 interaction .        in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : full ] , we show the result of @xmath0 scattering amplitude @xmath93 , obtained by solving the single - channel scattering equation with @xmath51 .",

    "we numerically checked that @xmath93 coincides with @xmath52 resulting from the coupled - channel equations .    in the @xmath0 scattering amplitude , the resonance structure is observed at around 1420 mev , significantly higher than the nominal position of the @xmath17 .",
    "however , the peak in the @xmath16 amplitude ( shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : full ] ) is in fact located close to 1405 mev .",
    "this is a consequence of the two - pole structure  @xcite , which we will discuss in detail in the following sections .",
    "results with the full model ( thick lines ) are not very much different from those with the two - channel model ( thin lines ) .",
    "this indicates that the scattering amplitude around the @xmath0 threshold is well described by the @xmath0-@xmath16 coupled - channel system , and we confirm that the @xmath94 and @xmath39 channels are unimportant for the physics of the @xmath0 interaction in the energy region of interest .",
    "we now discuss the pole structure of the @xmath17 resonance in greater detail .",
    "the @xmath0 scattering amplitude @xmath95 , obtained by using the two - channel model , develops two poles at @xmath96 these pole positions move slightly , to @xmath97 in the full model with four channels .",
    "again , the deviation from the two - channel model is only marginal .",
    "we thus confirm the dominance of the @xmath0-@xmath16 coupled - channel dynamics in the @xmath0 amplitude . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the poles @xmath98 and @xmath99 have different coupling strengths to the @xmath16 and @xmath0 channels , leading to the different shapes in the @xmath0 and @xmath16 amplitudes , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : full ] .",
    "next we study the origin of these poles .",
    "as previously mentioned , there is a pole [ eq .  ] in the amplitude @xmath100 representing @xmath16 single - channel resummation .",
    "we can also perform the resummation of the tree - level weinberg - tomozawa term in the single @xmath0 channel , which generates a bound state pole at @xmath101 the pole positions for single - channel , two - channel , and full models are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : pole ] .",
    "these positions obviously suggest that the pole @xmath102 is the origin of the poles @xmath103 and @xmath104 , whereas @xmath105 is the origin of the poles @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "this observation agrees once again with the qualitative behavior discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite that the pole @xmath98 strongly couples to the @xmath0 channel and the pole @xmath99 to the @xmath16 channel .    the principal features from chiral su(3 )",
    "dynamics underlying this behavior are as follows .",
    "the driving ( attractive ) @xmath29-wave interactions in the @xmath0 and @xmath16 channels are determined by the goldstone boson nature of the pseudoscalar octet mesons . in the chiral limit ( i.e. , with all quark masses @xmath108 and",
    "@xmath109 strictly equal to zero ) these interactions would all vanish at threshold , with massless kaon and pion .",
    "chiral symmetry dictates that their interaction strength grows linearly ( in leading order ) with their energy .",
    "explicit chiral symmetry breaking gives those mesons their masses and moves the meson - baryon threshold energies to their physical values . at the kaon - nucleon threshold ,",

    "the ratio of these driving interactions , @xmath119 is about 1.6 .",
    "the @xmath0 interaction is effectively stronger , but the @xmath16 interaction is sizable and can not be ignored even though the @xmath16 resonance pole is located at a considerable distance from the real axis in the complex energy plane .",
    "the isolated @xmath0 bound state , in contrast , has a binding energy of only 5 mev at this stage . by turning on the nondiagonal @xmath120 couplings , @xmath121 , both the @xmath16 resonance and @xmath0 bound state poles move to their final positions as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pole ] .",
    "the @xmath0 bound state turns into a quasibound state embedded in the @xmath16 continuum , with a decay width of about 35 mev . at the same time , by its coupling to the ( virtual ) @xmath0 channel , the previously isolated @xmath16 resonance shifts and reduces its width by about @xmath122 , from @xmath123 mev to @xmath124 mev .",
    "these considerations imply a subtlety in assigning a mass ( or a @xmath0 binding energy ) to the @xmath17 .",

    "the actual @xmath130 decay width is about 20@xmath131 smaller than the one naively identified with the breadth of the @xmath16 mass spectrum .",

    "\\label{eq : aypotential}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the amplitudes resulting from these potentials are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : potential_ay ] by thin lines , to be compared with our present results ( thick lines ) .",
    "the behavior of the amplitudes derived from the phenomenological potentials is seen to be drastically different from the chiral dynamics prediction , especially in the lower subthreshold energy region .",
    "the difference is certainly beyond the theoretical uncertainties estimated in sec .",
    "[ subsec : theoretical ] . as we discussed , chiral dynamics locates the @xmath17 in the @xmath0 amplitude around 1420 mev , whereas the phenomenological ay potential uses the pdg value of around 1405 mev .",
    "the difference is not only in the position of the @xmath17 but also in the magnitude of the amplitude .",
    "note also that the imaginary parts remain finite even below the @xmath16 threshold , since there is no energy dependence in the potentials  .    however , above the @xmath0 threshold , both chiral and phenomenological amplitudes behave similarly as both approaches are adjusted to describe existing data . these and the previous observations clearly point out the considerable ambiguities involved in the extrapolation of the amplitudes below the @xmath0 threshold .",
    "existing data sets are not sufficient to constrain the @xmath0 interaction in the energy region relevant for subthreshold antikaon - nucleon physics . at this point",
    "the minimal theoretical constraints from chiral su(3 ) dynamics turn out to be of crucial importance .",
    "we have constructed an effective @xmath0 potential in coordinate space based on chiral su(3 ) dynamics .",
    "this procedure involves two steps :        in performing step 1 we have systematically investigated how the dynamics of the @xmath16 channel ( and of other channels , which turn out not to be important ) influence the effective @xmath0 interaction .",
    "it is found that the @xmath16 interaction generates a broad resonance whereas the @xmath0 interaction produces a weakly bound state .",
    "the attractive forces in the @xmath0 and @xmath16 coupled channels cooperate to form the @xmath17 as a @xmath0 quasibound state embedded in the @xmath16 continuum .    as a consequence of the two - pole structure of the coupled @xmath0-@xmath16 system ,",
    "the @xmath0 quasibound state is located at @xmath146 mev , at a mass shifted upward from the pdg value of @xmath17 deduced from the maximum of the @xmath16 mass spectrum .",
    "we have examined several versions of chiral su(3 ) dynamical models to estimate theoretical uncertainties .",
    "the occurrence of the quasibound state at @xmath146 mev turns out to be model independent , irrespective of the wide spread in the locations of the second pole .",
    "this implies that the @xmath0 binding energy associated with the @xmath17 is actually not 27 mev but only 12 mev , indicating significantly less attraction in the effective @xmath0 interaction than previously anticipated on purely phenomenological grounds .",
    "in step 2 , we have constructed an equivalent local potential , with a gaussian r - space form factor reflecting finite range effects .",
    "the range parameter is adjusted so as to reproduce the position of the @xmath0 quasibound state and found to be somewhat smaller than that expected from a vector meson exchange picture . in any case , a local parametrization of the @xmath0 effective interaction works only with an adjustment of its energy dependence .",
    "this extra energy dependence considerably reduces the attractive strength of the potential in the subthreshold region as compared to naive expectations .",
    "uncertainties concerning subthreshold extrapolations of the effective @xmath0 interaction still remain as long as the constraints from threshold @xmath0 data and from the @xmath16 mass spectrum in the @xmath21 channel are relatively weak and partly ambiguous .",
    "there is a strong demand for further improvements in this empirical data base .",
    "nonetheless , the theoretical constraints on the strengths of the @xmath0 and @xmath16 interactions from chiral su(3 ) dynamics are certainly mandatory to reduce the freedom of extrapolation .",
    "the potential so obtained suggests itself for applications in antikaon - nuclear few - body calculations .",
    "results for the @xmath7 prototype system are reported in ref .",
    "the overall picture presented here , constrained by chiral su(3 ) dynamics , differs strongly from previous purely phenomenological approaches , in that the resulting effective potential is significantly less attractive in the energy range relevant to the discussion of deeply bound antikaon - nuclear clusters .",
