    "since the concept of pseudospin ( ps ) was introduced more than 40 years ago  @xcite , the pseudospin symmetry ( pss ) in single particle states has been an interesting topic in nuclear physics  @xcite . in 1997",
    "it was found that the pss in nuclei is a relativistic symmetry which is exactly conserved when the scalar and vector potentials have the same size but opposite sign , i.e. , @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "later it was shown that the pss is exact under a less strict condition , @xmath1  @xcite .    by extending the study of the pss to negative energy states , it was found that the above mentioned conditions also result in the spin symmetry ( ss ) in anti - nucleon spectra which is much better developed than the pss in nuclear single particle spectra  @xcite .",
    "the ss and pss have been investigated extensively within the relativistic framework including the pss in deformed nuclei  @xcite , the ss for @xmath2 spectra in hyper - nuclei  @xcite , and these symmetries in various potentials  @xcite .",
    "the readers are referred to ref .",
    "@xcite for a review and refs .",
    "@xcite for recent progresses .",
    "in particular , a very extensive overview was given in ref .",
    "@xcite for the study of pss and ss .",
    "quite recently , the node structure of radial dirac wavefunctions in central confining potentials was studied and it was shown in a general way that it is possible to have positive energy bound solutions for these potentials under the condition of exact pss  @xcite .",
    "note that there have been some investigations of pss connected with some specific forms of confining potentials  @xcite .    in recent years , the study of nuclear single - particle resonant states , especially those in exotic nuclei with unusual @xmath3 ratios becomes more and more important  @xcite .",
    "there have been some numerical studies on the pss  @xcite and ss  @xcite in single particle resonant states . in a recent work",
    ", we have shown that the pss in single particle resonant states is also exactly conserved under the same condition for the pss in bound states , i.e. , @xmath4 or @xmath1  @xcite . in this contribution we will present some results given in ref .",
    "we gave a rigorous justification of the pss in single particle resonant states by examining the asymptotic behaviour of the radial dirac wave functions in ref .",
    "@xcite ; more details will be given in a future publication  @xcite .",
    "next we briefly mention the justification of the pss in single particle resonant states under the condition @xmath4 or @xmath1 .    in relativistic mean field models ,",

    "for brevity we will omit the subscripts from @xmath17 and @xmath18 whenever no confusion arises .",
    "the radial dirac equation is a first order coupled equation and can be rewritten as two decoupled second order differential ones . for the small component to which the pss is directly connected",
    ", the second order differential equation reads , @xmath19 g(r )   & = &    0 ,    \\label{eq : g}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 .    for the continuum in the fermi sea , i.e. ,",
    "@xmath22 , there exist two independent solutions for eq .",
    "( [ eq : g ] ) .",
    "the physically acceptable solution is the one that vanishes at the origin and behaves like @xmath23 as @xmath24  @xcite , @xmath25    the resonance parameters are connected with the asymptotic behavior of the regular solution as @xmath26 . at large @xmath27",
    "the potentials for neutrons vanish and the wave functions oscillate , eq .  ( [ eq : g ] ) becomes a ricatti - bessel equation with angular momentum @xmath28 and the solution can be written as a combination of the ricatti - hankel functions , @xmath29 ,     \\",
    "r\\rightarrow\\infty   , \\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the jost function for the small component and @xmath31 the ricatti - hankel functions .",
    "it has been argued that in nuclei the jost function is an analytic function of @xmath32 and can be analytically continued to a large area in the complex @xmath32 plane  @xcite .",
    "the zeros of the jost function @xmath30 on the complex momentum plane correspond to bound states or resonances : the zeros on the positive imaginary axis of the @xmath32 plane represent bound states of the original eigenvalue problem , while those on the lower @xmath32 plane and near the real axis correspond to resonant states .",
    "the resonance energy @xmath33 and width @xmath34 are determined by the relation @xmath35 . by examining the zeros of the jost function we studied the bound and resonant states on the same footing  @xcite .    in the pss limit , eq .",
    "( [ eq : g ] ) is reduced as @xmath36   g(r )   =   0   . ~\\label{eq : psleqg}\\ ] ] for the continuum @xmath37 can be any value @xmath38 and one can mainly focus on wave functions and their asymptotic behavior .",
    "for ps doublets with different quantum numbers @xmath39 and @xmath40 with @xmath41 , the small components satisfy the same equation because they have the same pseudo - orbital angular momentum @xmath28  @xcite . in particular , for continuum states , @xmath42 for any energy @xmath37 . because the definition of the jost function @xmath30 only depends on the asymptotic behavior of the small component",
    ", we have @xmath43 on the positive real axis .",
    "this equivalence can be generalized into the complex @xmath32 plane due to the uniqueness of the analytic continuation .",
    "thus the zeros are the same for @xmath44 and @xmath30 : if there exists a resonant state with energy @xmath33 and width @xmath34 and the quantum number @xmath39 , there must be another one with the same energy and width and quantum number @xmath45 .",
    "that is to say , the pss in single particle resonant states in nuclei is exactly conserved when the attractive scalar and repulsive vector potentials have the same magnitude but opposite sign  @xcite .    in scattering theories , one can also determine resonance parameters from the change of cross section or phase shift which give us more insights into the resonant phenomena . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the pss in resonant states has also been studied by examining the phase shift . for simplicity",
    ", we do not give the details here .",
    "for ps doublets of single particle resonant states in nuclei , not only the energies , but also the widths are exactly the same in the pss limit .",
    "similar to what happens in bound states , when the pss limit is not realized , the pss in resonant states is broken . in ref .",
    "@xcite we used a solvable model and the woods - saxon potentials to illustrate the conservation and the breaking of the pss in resonant states .",
    "we considered that @xmath46 and @xmath47 are both spherical square - well potentials , @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are constants and @xmath51 is the width . for @xmath52 , eq .",

    "the coefficient @xmath56 is inserted in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ eq : regularsolution ] ) and @xmath57 as @xmath58 .",

    "therefore , in the pss limit , i.e. , @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "consequently the pss is conserved both in bound states and in resonant states .",
    "if @xmath62 , the pss is broken and we can study the ps splitting of the energy and the width for resonant states . due to the special form of the spherical square - well potentials ,",
    "the pss - breaking term is separated from the pss - conserving term in the jost function , which makes the study of the conservation or the breaking of the pss very convenient .     on the complex energy plane in square - well potentials ( [ eq : square_well ] ) with @xmath60 ( solid symbols ) and",

    "it is found that splittings of energy and width both become smaller compared with the results with the square - well potentials .",
    "the reason is that the derivative of @xmath46 is smaller due to a non - zero diffusivity parameter .",
    "we showed that the pss in single particle bound and resonant states in nuclei can be investigated on the same footing within the relativistic framework by examining the zeros of jost functions corresponding to small components of nucleon dirac wave functions . in the pss limit ,",
    "i.e. , the attractive scalar and repulsive vector potentials have the same magnitude but opposite sign , small components of ps doublets are exactly the same . thus jost functions describing the asymptotic behavior of the radial wave functions are identical to each other .",
    "when analytically continued to complex momentum plane , the resonant states , showing themselves as zeros of the jost functions , are always paired in the pss limit , which leads to the exact pss .",
    "the conservation of the pss in the pss limit was also justified by examining the phase shift of continuum states .",
