    "since the discovery of the cosmic microwave background , the predominant view has been that the universe originated from a cosmic singularity .",
    "an important consequence is that the universe has a finite age and a finite causal horizon distance . for the standard hot big bang model ,",
    "this leads to the horizon puzzle that inspired inflationary cosmology @xcite . by introducing a period of superluminal expansion",
    ", inflation alleviates the horizon puzzle , but it is generally believed that an initial singularity is still required at the outset .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the possibility that the singularity is actually a transition between a contracting big crunch phase and an expanding big bang phase .",
    "if true , the universe may have existed for a semi - infinite time prior to the putative big bang .",
    "the horizon puzzle would be nullified , eliminating one of the prime motivations for inflation .",
    "the analysis opens the door to alternative cosmologies with other solutions to the remaining cosmological puzzles .",
    "the discussion in this paper focuses on @xmath0-dimensional field theory and is not specific to any particular cosmological model . a crucial role in our analysis",
    "is played by a massless scalar field - a modulus .",
    "( the cosmology of such fields has been analyzed by many authors.@xcite ) we eschew any use of branes and strings until absolutely necessary .",
    "string theory will become important at the point where the universe bounces from contraction to expansion .    here",
    ", our discussion is closely related to considerations of the reversal problem in the pre - big bang scenarios of veneziano , _",
    "et al._@xcite and related scenarios@xcite .",
    "a notable difference , as we shall emphasize below , is that the reversal in the pre - big bang model occurs in the limit of strongly coupled string theory whereas we are interested in reversal in the limit of weakly coupled string theory @xcite .",
    "the differences have profound consequences for both cosmology and fundamental physics .    in section",
    "ii , we show that reversal requires either a violation of the null energy condition or passage through a singularity where the scale factor shrinks to zero .",
    "the remainder of the paper explores the second possibility . in section iii ,",
    "we obtain the solutions for a single scalar field evolving in a contracting friedmann - robertson - walker background and use them to demonstrate the difference between our proposal and the pre - big bang scenario . in section iv",
    ", we reformulate the theory in variables which are finite as the scale factor shrinks to zero and which suggest a natural way to match solutions at the bounce .",
    "section v solves for the evolution before and after the bounce in cases where the bounce is elastic and time - symmetric and cases where it is inelastic and time - asymmetric .",
    "section vi compares the singularity considered here to bounces and singularities considered in other contexts in string theory .",
    "section vii focuses on the bounce itself where , we argue , string theory must play a critical role in passage through the singularity .",
    "we conjecture that the cosmological singularity connects contracting and expanding solutions in a manner analogous to the conifold and flop transitions . in section viii",
    ", we discuss the implications of our results for cosmology , particularly the ekpyrotic scenario @xcite .",
    "we suggest a major modification of the scenario in which the hot big bang phase is created in a collision between two boundary branes , removing the need for bulk branes .",
    "the reversal problem is notoriously difficult because a violation of the null energy condition is required . consider a general 4d theory of scalar fields @xmath1 coupled to gravity .",
    "we are free to weyl transform to the einstein frame : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the spacetime metric ( in minkowski space , @xmath4 ) , @xmath5 is the ricci scalar , and @xmath6 is the metric on field space .",
    "we consider unitary theories in which @xmath7 is positive definite .",
    "the energy momentum tensor is @xmath8,\\ ] ] where the repeated greek or roman indices follow the standard summation convention .",
    "if we assume homogeneity and isotropy , then @xmath3 is a friedmann - robertson - walker metric and the energy density @xmath9 and the pressure @xmath10 are @xmath11 where dots denote proper time derivatives , and @xmath12 .",
    "a problem arises because scalar fields satisfy the null energy condition : @xmath13 in a friedmann - robertson - walker universe , the expansion rate is set by the parameter @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the scale factor .",
    "the time variation of @xmath16 assuming a flat universe is given by @xmath17 if @xmath18 , then reversal from contraction ( @xmath19 ) to expansion ( @xmath20 ) is not possible .",
    "hence , we obtain the theorem : given a flat universe and a unitary theory with terms second order in field derivatives , then the contracting big crunch phase and the expanding big bang phase are separated by a singularity .",
    "similar theorems and considerations of ways of circumventing them have been discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "both the pre - big bang model and the scenario we consider entail the problem of reversal from contraction to expansion in the einstein frame . in pre - big bang models , the common approach has been to consider violating one of the assumptions of the theorem derived above @xcite . for example , by introducing higher derivative terms in the action , the null energy condition can be violated and reversal might take place without reaching the singularity . in this paper , we consider the alternative possibility of proceeding to @xmath21 and bouncing without introducing new terms in the action .",
    "both approaches can be modeled by an action with a scalar field @xmath22 plus gravity : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the ricci scalar based on the metric @xmath3 .",
    "here we have generalized to @xmath0-dimensions and simplified to the case of a single field @xmath22 , and we have chosen units in which the coefficient of @xmath5 in the @xmath25dimensional einstein - frame lagrangian is unity . for the moment , we consider the case where the potential @xmath26 .",
    "this kind of model arises in the low energy approximation to type iia and iib string theory for @xmath27 .",
    "it also arises whenever a @xmath28-dimensional gravity theory is compactified to @xmath0-dimensions , where @xmath22 ( the ` radion ' ) determines the length of the compact dimension .",
    "we further simplify by restricting ourselves to a mini - superspace consisting of spatially flat , homogeneous and isotropic solutions with metric @xmath29 $ ] . in the gauge @xmath30 , @xmath31 is conformal time . then , the solutions to the equations of motion up to a shift in @xmath31 are : @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 and @xmath35 are integration constants set by the initial conditions .",

    "the universe contracts to a big crunch as @xmath37 . for @xmath38 ,",
    "the universe expands from a big bang beginning at @xmath39 .    at @xmath40 ,",
    "the solutions are singular and @xmath41 . in the case of type iia ( or heterotic ) string theory in @xmath27 ,",
    "the string coupling is @xmath42 ( see discussion of eq .",
    "( [ eq : stringmet ] ) below ) , so the two solutions at the bounce ( as @xmath43 ) correspond to weak and strong coupling , respectively .",
    "we will find it useful to re - express the model in terms of the  string metric \" @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "the action based on the string metric is : @xmath46 this definition of the string metric agrees with the standard metric for @xmath27 and the string metric for @xmath47 as defined in the pre - big bang literature @xcite .    the two solutions in eq .",
    "( [ sol ] ) are easily transformed to the string frame @xmath48 , where we can compare them to solutions in the pre - bang scenario .",
    "we can express the solutions in terms of string - frame frw time @xmath49 , where @xmath50 : @xmath51 using these we find @xmath52 where dot denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath49 .",
    "there is a key difference between the pre - big bang scenario and the reversal considered here .",
    "we approach weak coupling as @xmath53 corresponding to the @xmath54 branch of eq .",
    "( [ sol ] ) .",
    "the pre - big bang scenario approaches strong coupling as @xmath55 corresponding to the @xmath56 solution .",
    "the two scenarios may be compared by mapping their trajectories in the plane spanned by @xmath57 and @xmath58 , a method commonly introduced@xcite to describe the pre - big bang picture in @xmath47 .",
    "note that the ratio @xmath59 is negative for @xmath60 if @xmath61 ( our solution ) and positive if @xmath62 .",
    "this expression describes the four solutions shown in fig .  1 .",
    "as noted above , for the pre - big bang model , the @xmath56 solution in which @xmath22 runs to @xmath63 ( strong coupling ) is chosen for @xmath36 .",
    "it has been proposed @xcite that new terms in the action appear in the strong coupling limit that violate the null energy condition ( _ e.g. _ , by introducing high derivative interactions and potentials ) making it possible to avoid @xmath22 running off to @xmath63 , as shown by the dashed curve .",
    "whatever physics is involved , it is presumed to freeze the dilaton ( so eq .  ( [ sol ] ) is no longer applicable ) and create radiation that dominates the universe .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath64 is positive and @xmath65 ( assuming @xmath22 is frozen ) is negative .",
    "hence , the universe joins onto a path similar to what is shown in the figure .",
    "by contrast , the trajectory proposed in this paper maintains @xmath66 throughout .",
    "this is a fundamental difference that distinguishes everything we say in the remainder of this paper from the pre - big bang scenario .",
    "a key step in tracking the universe across the bounce at @xmath21 is to find variables which are finite as @xmath67 .",

    "their range for @xmath70 and @xmath22 real is the quadrant @xmath71 or @xmath72 .    the effective lagrangian for @xmath73 is transformed to @xcite : @xmath74 = -\\frac{4 ( d-1)}{n(d-2 ) } { a}_+ ' { a}_-',\\ ] ] where primes denote derivatives with respect to conformal time @xmath31 . in the moduli space spanned by @xmath75",
    "we identify @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) as a time - like ( space - like ) variable and @xmath78 as light - cone coordinates",
    ". we shall consider trajectories which bounce at @xmath79 corresponding to a point on the moduli space boundary @xmath80 . without loss of generality the value of @xmath31 at the bounce",
    "can be chosen to be @xmath40 .",
    "we can not describe exactly what occurs at @xmath40 .",
    "however , what is encouraging is that we have found a choice of variables , @xmath81 that remain finite for @xmath36 and @xmath38 , and there appears to be a natural way to match at @xmath40 .",
    "it is instructive to change variables for the solution to eq .",
    "( [ sol ] ) with @xmath54 to @xmath82 this leads to a reformulated action @xmath83 with no kinetic term for @xmath84 .",

    "coordinates one can always set @xmath91 . in terms of the original metric @xmath3 ,",
    "the universe shrinks to a point at @xmath40 .",
    "however , we see that the metric @xmath86 is smooth there .    one should not read too much into this .",
    "the change of variables does not make the problem entirely regular .",
    "first and foremost , since @xmath92 , the planck scale vanishes at the bounce in these coordinates .",
    "hence , there is the concern that quantum fluctuations become uncontrolled at @xmath40 .",
    "note also that @xmath93 is singular at @xmath40 , so higher dimension operators are also important at the bounce .",
    "therefore , even in these variables , we see the importance of going beyond the field theoretic descriptions to understand the physics at @xmath40 .",
    "we must assume that the field theories considered here are low energy approximations to some more fundamental theory .",
    "the action in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) in terms of @xmath84 and @xmath86 is just the einstein - hilbert action for @xmath94-dimensional gravity theory compactified to @xmath0 dimensions . to see that ,",
    "consider the @xmath28-dimensional metric @xmath95 and let it depend only on the @xmath0-dimensional variables @xmath96 .",
    "( for simplicity , we neglect the vector field arising from the @xmath97 components of the metric . )",
    "a straightforward calculation leads to @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the metric in @xmath28-dimensions .",
    "constraining @xmath100 to lie in the range @xmath101 $ ] , the @xmath28-dimensional hilbert - einstein action is reduced to eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "for example , the compactification can be on a circle , as in kaluza - klein theory , or on an interval , where @xmath22 or @xmath84 can be interpreted as a radion .",
    "if the compactified dimension is a line segment there are two boundary branes at the ends @xcite . then , @xmath21 corresponds to a circle collapsing to a point or the branes colliding at @xmath40 .    substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq : barsol ] ) into the metric , we obtain @xmath102 the space - time is remarkably simple .",
    "it is simply @xmath103 , where the @xmath104 dimensions are euclidean and @xmath105 is a @xmath106 compactified milne universe ( figure [ milne ] ) with @xmath107 .",
    "each branch of our solutions spans a wedge in minkowski space compactified on an interval @xmath108 $ ] with endpoints identified .",
    "equivalently , if the metric is re - expressed in minkowski lightcone coordinates @xmath109 where @xmath110 , then @xmath105 corresponds to flat minkowski space modded out by the boost @xmath111 , @xmath112 .",
    "such a compactified milne universe has been discussed g. horowitz and a. steif.@xcite our bounce connects two branches of @xmath105 at @xmath40 . as mentioned ,",
    "if the extra dimension is a circle , it contracts to zero at @xmath40 , and re - expands .",
    "if the extra dimension is an interval , the two boundary branes follow the heavy lines in figure [ milne ] , bouncing off each other .",
    "equivalently , as the figure suggests , one can say that the two boundary branes meet and pass through one another .",
    "the variables @xmath76 and @xmath77 defined above are given by @xmath113 , @xmath114 , so these bounce at @xmath40 . finally , note that the proper distance between the branes in the milne metric is @xmath115 , and we see the physical interpretation of the constant @xmath116 as the magnitude of the relative velocity of the branes .",
    "in the usual kaluza - klein reduction from @xmath28 to @xmath0 dimensions the variables defined in ( [ defns ] ) parameterize the geometry as follows",
    ". the scale factor of the noncompact @xmath0 dimensional space as measured by the canonical @xmath28 dimensional metric is @xmath117 , which has been set to unity .",
    "the size of the extra dimension is proportional to @xmath118 , which can take on any positive value .",
    "thus the range of @xmath22 is @xmath119 .",
    "other @xmath28 dimensional theories can reduce to the same @xmath0 dimensional effective field theory , but the geometrical meaning of the @xmath15 , @xmath22 variables and their range may differ .",
    "for example , consider @xmath120 bounded by a positive and a negative tension brane .",
    "the induced scale factor on the positive ( negative ) tension brane is @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) , with @xmath121 , so that @xmath22 is restricted to be less than zero .",
    "the distance between the branes is proportional to log@xmath122 , which agrees with the kaluza - klein result at short distances where the variation of the warp factor is negligible .",
    "we note that more general compactifications with additional dimensions lead to more complicated actions which depend on several moduli .",
    "if the moduli space can be reformulated in terms of variables analogous to @xmath78 that are finite at the bounce , a similar analysis should hold .",
    "alternatively , the bounce trajectories are restricted to cases where the time - derivatives of the additional fields are zero and the theory reduces to the current examples . however , the simple interpretation of @xmath86 in eq .",
    "( [ met ] ) as a time - independent metric is only valid for compactifications of a single dimension .    when the theory in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is derived from compactification as in eq .",
    "( [ tran ] ) , the bounce solution corresponds to shrinking the compact dimension to zero size and then expanding it again .",
    "( in the work of brandenberger , vafa , and tseytlin @xcite , they considered the situation where one spatial dimension collapsed and a different one opened up .",
    "this is also an interesting possibility which may be equally good for our purposes . ) throughout this process the metric in the noncompact dimensions as measured by the @xmath28-dimensional metric in eq .",
    "( [ met ] ) is unchanged .",
    "such an intuitive picture suggests that indeed the two branches of the solution in eq .",
    "( [ sol ] ) ( or in terms of the coordinates @xmath123 , @xmath84 in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) ) are indeed connected .",
    "however , it should be stressed that the dimensional reduction from @xmath28 dimensions to @xmath0 dimensions makes the bounce natural but it does not prove that it exists .",
    "we have the machinery in hand to track the evolution as the universe approaches the bounce ( or rebounds afterwards ) . from varying the action in eq .",
    "( [ eq : apm ] ) with respect to @xmath124 , we obtain the constraint , @xmath125 . ( expressed in terms of @xmath15 and @xmath22 , this corresponds to the friedmann equation . )",
    "consequently , we are only permitted solutions where @xmath126 .",
    "the minus sign solution must apply if the branes are to collide .",
    "the incoming trajectory intersects the light - like boundary of moduli space @xmath127 along a light - like trajectory .",
    "if we assume that no radiation is produced , then to satisfy the energy constraint , the solution after collision must also be light - like .",
    "there then appears only one natural possibility for the trajectory to follow , which is to bounce straight back off the light cone , @xmath128 , as occurs in the milne universe example explained above .",
    "returning to the lagrangian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : apm ] ) , we now add a potential term , @xmath129 .",
    "up to an unimportant constant , the total lagrangian becomes : @xmath130 where the function @xmath131 is related to the potential .",
    "since our convention is that the weak coupling region is @xmath132 , the potential should vanish in that limit or , equivalently , @xmath133 should vanish for small values of its argument .    as an exercise , it is instructive to consider a case where the equations of motion are exactly solvable : @xmath134 where @xmath135 .",
    "this example corresponds to @xmath136 . in the gauge",
    "@xmath30 the solution up to a shift of @xmath31 around @xmath40 is @xmath137 where @xmath10 is an arbitrary positive constant .",
    "consider first the case of @xmath138 positive , i.e.  a positive potential .",
    "the universe has @xmath21 at @xmath40 where @xmath139 . for positive @xmath31",
    ", the universe expands to infinite size .",
    "@xmath22 on the other hand approaches @xmath140 at @xmath141 , it increases , reaches a maximum value at some fixed @xmath31 , and then slides back to @xmath140 as @xmath142 . for negative times",
    "the picture is symmetric . in particular , the universe is contracting as @xmath55 .    for negative @xmath138",
    "the potential is negative . in this case",
    "the solution eq .",
    "( [ soleomg ] ) can not be trusted beyond a critical value of @xmath143 where @xmath144 vanishes . at that point @xmath21 and @xmath145 .",
    "since the potential is not bounded from below , it is not surprising that @xmath22 reaches @xmath146 in finite time . in the brane picture , the repulsion makes the higher dimensional space infinite in a finite time .",
    "we have no reason to expect another bounce at this point . again , the picture is symmetric around @xmath40 .",
    "the two solutions are represented in figure [ figure3 ] .    in the examples considered thus far ,",
    "the bounce at @xmath132 is time - symmetric .",
    "the potential is taken to vanish in that limit , and the trajectory in the @xmath75-plane intersects the boundary of moduli space @xmath147 along a light - like direction . after the bounce it simply reverses , corresponding to the matching condition @xmath148 .",
    "this could be described as an _",
    "collision , since the internal states of the two branes are unchanged after collision .",
    "as the velocity approaches zero , the boundary brane collision may be nearly elastic , resulting in no radiation being produced on the branes . but at finite velocity",
    ", we should expect entropy production as radiation modes are excited both in the bulk and on the colliding branes .",
    "let us consider the description of fluids produced on the branes at the collision .",
    "the action for a fluid in a background metric @xmath149 is @xmath150 , where @xmath9 is implicitly determined in terms of @xmath149 by the fluid equations . in the present context , where the matter couples to the higher dimensional metric , we should take @xmath149 to be @xmath86 given in eq .",
    "( [ barg ] ) , rather than the einstein - frame four dimensional metric @xmath3 .",
    "this difference is very important . whereas the einstein frame scale factor @xmath15 vanishes at the singularity ,",
    "the scale factor @xmath151 is finite there . in consequence ,",
    "fluids coupling to @xmath151 have finite density and temperature at the singularity . the usual infinite blue - shift caused by the vanishing of @xmath15",
    "is precisely cancelled by an infinite ` fifth force ' red - shift due to the coupling to @xmath22 , as @xmath152 .",
    "we see once more that within the context we are discussing , the big crunch / big bang singularity is remarkably non - singular .",
    "let us consider as an example the case where the incoming state has no radiation , and the potential @xmath153 asymptotes to zero as @xmath154 , and remains zero after the collision .",
    "assume also that a small amount of radiation is produced , so the collision is slightly ` inelastic ' .",
    "the ` elastic ' matching condition discussed above , @xmath155 , can not apply , since it would be incompatible with the friedmann constraint , which reads @xmath156 as stressed above , each term in this equation is perfectly finite at @xmath21 ( the ` singularity ' ) .",
    "but the presence of the positive radiation / matter density term on the right hand side means that the outgoing trajectory must be time - like in the @xmath157-plane .",
    "the details of the microscopic physics determine the amount of radiation which is generated by the collision . in terms of the long distance",
    "effective theory that we have been using the microscopic physics also determines the precise boundary conditions on @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "if before the collision the system has no radiation and the potential vanishes for @xmath160 , the trajectory in field space hits the boundary along a light - like curve . as we said , because of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fc ] ) if radiation is being generated , it bounces off the boundary along a time - like curve and the trajectory is not time - symmetric .",
    "this discussion will be further elaborated upon in ref .",
    "( [ lyth ] ) .",
    "when referring to the moduli space in string theory , one usually has in mind the moduli of the compact dimensions , keeping the noncompact dimensions unchanged . in particular ,",
    "the scale size of the noncompact dimensions @xmath15 is not usually considered to be one of the coordinates on moduli space .",
    "most of the singularities which are studied in string theory are at finite distance in moduli space . at such a singularity",
    "the presence of gravity can be neglected , and the essential physics of the singularity is described by local quantum field theory .",
    "the latter can be either a weakly coupled quantum field theory with new light degrees of freedom which become massless at the singularity , or a strongly coupled quantum field theory at a nontrivial fixed point of the renormalization group .",
    "a typical example of such a singularity is the small @xmath161 instanton transition in which a bulk brane hits the boundary brane @xcite .",
    "this is the singularity which was proposed to be the initiation of the big bang phase in the ekpyrotic model @xcite .",
    "the singularity of interest here is of a totally different nature .",
    "we are interested in the singularity at @xmath162 .",
    "the metric on @xmath163 space is given from the kinetic terms in the action ( [ eq : apm ] ) .",
    "after a trivial scaling of @xmath15 the line element is proportional to @xmath164 . for fixed @xmath15 ,",
    "the singularity is clearly at infinite distance in moduli space .",
    "the way we manage to reach it at finite time is to consider a motion not only in the @xmath22 moduli space but in an extended space including also the scale size of the noncompact dimensions @xmath15 .",
    "since this extended space has lorentzian signature , the proper distance to @xmath165 can be finite even when it is infinite to any generic @xmath15 .",
    "the fact that @xmath15 vanishes at the singularity has profound implications . unlike the other singularities which are field theoretic , here gravity can not be ignored .",
    "therefore , the physics of the singularity can not be described by local quantum field theory coupled to weakly coupled gravity .",
    "it is an important challenge to find other such singularities and to describe them in detail .",
    "to prove that the transition past @xmath21 can occur smoothly , one must have a consistent theory at short distances and complete control of the dynamics at the singularity .",
    "here is where string theory becomes an essential element . to determine what happens at @xmath21 , it is natural to try to embed our solution in string theory which provides a complete theory of quantum gravity .",
    "our equations can be embedded in string theory in several different ways .",
    "the most straightforward way is to embed it in type iia or the heterotic string in @xmath27 by identifying @xmath22 with the dilaton . as pointed out in the discussion following eq .",
    "( [ met ] ) , @xmath166 of eq .",

    "is our background a solution of the m theory equations of motion ?",
    "the fact that the m theory metric @xmath168 is flat might suggest that the answer to this question is positive .",

    "the string coupling @xmath179 also becomes large .",
    "however , the theory is still manageable . in type iia theory ,",
    "the theory becomes m - theory in eleven dimensions where the size of the eleventh dimension is large @xcite .",
    "we can also consider type iib theory on our background .",
    "the low energy theory is still of the form in eq .",
    "( [ eq : stringact ] ) , and its solution can be expressed using the string theory variables as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : stringmet ] ) .",
    "however , we no longer have the argument for the bounce which is based on the compactification of a higher dimensional theory .",
    "still we can examine the behavior of each branch of the solution . at long time the string coupling is large and",
    "we can use s - duality to transform the solution to another weakly coupled description with @xmath189 .",
    "the canonical einstein metric , @xmath190 does not transform and remains large , but the string metric , @xmath191 shrinks to a point .",
    "another context in which our background can arise in string theory is when there are some other compact dimensions .",
    "consider for example the compactification of m theory on the flat space @xmath192 .",
    "that is , we compactify one of the euclidean dimensions of the previously mentioned background on a circle .",
    "we consider the @xmath193 factor as the m theory circle , and interpret the theory as type iia theory on @xmath194 .",
    "since the size of the @xmath193 is independent of spacetime , the string coupling is constant .",
    "furthermore , since the metric on @xmath195 is flat ( except perhaps at @xmath40 ) this is an exact solution of the string equations of motion to all orders in @xmath186 . as we explained above , the background breaks supersymmetry and , therefore",
    ", we can not argue that this is also an exact solution to all orders in @xmath179 .",
    "of particular interest are the winding modes around the spatial circle in @xmath105 near @xmath40 .",
    "they are reminiscent of the tachyonic winding modes which were recently studied by adams _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "these modes might lead to an instability of our system near the singularity and to a divergence of the loop diagrams .",
    "one might be tempted to use t - duality to transform the winding modes to momentum modes .",
    "the t - dual metric and string coupling are @xmath196 and @xmath197 .",
    "both the t - dual curvature and the t - dual string coupling are large for @xmath198 and , therefore , the t - dual picture is not useful . the precise behavior of these modes and of other effects near the singularity is a fascinating issue which we hope to return to in a future publication .",
    "our conjecture is that the universe can undergo a transition from a big crunch to a big bang by passing through a string theoretic regime which connects the two phases .",
    "it is standard in string compactifications to have a singularity which is common to several different classical spaces .",
    "the theory at the singularity is often less singular than one might expect classically@xcite .",
    "the flop @xcite and the conifold @xcite transitions are particular examples of this general phenomenon .",
    "even though these singularities are spatial singularities , it is also likely that dynamical singularities like our big crunch and big bang singularities are similarly connected in string theory .",
    "if so , what has been perceived as the beginning of time may simply be a bridge to a pre - existing phase of the universe .",
    "the door is thereby opened to whole new classes of cosmological models , alternatives to the standard big bang and inflationary models .",
    "a particularly pertinent example is the recently proposed `` ekpyrotic '' model of the universe @xcite . according to this model ,",
    "the universe began in a non - singular , nearly vacuous quasistatic state that lasted for an indefinite period .",
    "the initial state can be described as a nearly bps ( bogolmonyi - prasad - sommerfeld ) configuration of two orbifold boundary branes and a ( 3 + 1)-dimensional brane in the bulk moving slowly along the intervening fifth dimension .",
    "the bulk brane is attracted to a boundary brane by a force associated with a negative scalar potential .",
    "the radiation that fuels the hot big bang is generated in the collision between the branes .",
    "the bps condition ensures that the universe is homogeneous and spatially flat .",
    "ripples in the brane surface created by quantum fluctuations as the branes approach result in a nearly scale - invariant spectrum of density perturbations after the collision . in short ,",
    "all of the cosmological problems of the standard hot big bang model are addressed .    for a bulk - brane / boundary - brane collision ,",
    "the modulus that determines the distance between the branes remains finite and gravity is only a spectator .",
    "consequently , this collision entails none of the subtleties discussed in this paper .",
    "however , in order for the ekpyrotic model to be viable , there remains an important challenge . in the long wavelength limit",
    ", the brane picture can be described by an effective 4d field theory with negative potential energy .",
    "beginning from a static state , a negative potential energy causes the effective 4d scale factor to shrink @xcite . in the braneworld picture",
    ", the universe continues to shrink because the boundary branes are approaching one another@xcite .",
    "it is essential that a mechanism exist that will reverse contraction to expansion after the bulk and boundary branes collide , a point emphasized by many people @xcite .    in this paper , we have focused on the reversal process and , particularly , on the possibility of a collision and rebound between the boundary branes .",
    "our result suggests that the reversal to increasing @xmath15 might be accomplished by a second collision between the boundary branes .",
    "the essence of our argument is that there exist variables that remain finite on each side of the bounce and that there is a natural way to match across the bounce . in ref .",
    "( [ lyth ] ) , we discuss how perturbations created during the contracting phase evolve into the expanding phase by identifying a set of perturbation variables that also remain finite at the bounce and naturally match across the boundary .",
    "a major modification of the ekpyrotic scenario suggests itself .",
    "perhaps the scenario can be accomplished with only the boundary branes and no bulk brane .",
    "qualitatively , it is straightforward to show that , if there is a negative , attractive potential drawing the two boundary branes towards one another which satisfies the conditions assumed before for the bulk brane - boundary brane potential , a nearly scale - invariant spectrum of perturbations will be produced that remains after the bounce , as discussed in ref .",
    "( [ lyth ] ) .",
    "we are currently examining this alternative scenario to determine if the quantitative requirements for the density perturbations can be met .",
    "if so , this would represent a significant simplification relying on novel physical processes that occur when boundary branes collide .      we thank t. banks , g. horowitz , j. maldacena , j. polchinski and e. witten for useful discussions .",
