    "it is well known that the standard model ( sm ) amplitudes for many processes exhibit zeros in the angular distributions .",
    "many of these zeros are in the physical region and therefore can , in principle , be observed experimentally . since the zeros leave deep dips in angular distributions for many high energy physics processes , they can be used to test the sm .",
    "any non - standard model physics has a strong impact on these dips and will tend to wash them out .    in section  2 , we discuss the processes @xmath2 where these zeros were encountered first . in section 3",
    "we briefly review classical radiation zeros , which are a limiting case of the quantum radiation zeros . in section 4",
    "we discuss the conditions which have to be fulfilled in order that radiation zeros can occur . in section 5",
    "we consider several examples of radiation zeros .",
    "zeros in @xmath3 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 production at hadron colliders and their role in testing the sm are discussed in section 6 .",
    "the @xmath5 and @xmath6 collision processes @xmath7 , initially proposed as a candidate for measuring the magnetic moment of the @xmath8 boson @xcite , exhibit zeros in the angular distribution at the parton level @xcite .",
    "ll & +    the position of the zero depends only on the charge of the quark ( no helicity dependence )  : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the angle between @xmath11 and @xmath12 quark ( see fig .",
    "[ parton_wgamma]a ) , and @xmath13 is the electric charge of the quark in units of the proton charge @xmath14 .    the value of @xmath15 ( see fig .",
    "[ parton_wgamma]b ) , obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : zero ] ) , is in fact , characteristic for some other sm based process amplitudes too , as we will discuss later .    from the experimental point of view , the tevatron collider ( @xmath6 ) is especially well suited to observe the radiation zero predicted in @xmath4 production .",
    "sea quark effects tend to wash out the dip caused by the radiation zero . at tevatron energies ,",
    "valence quark effects dominate and this effect is not a problem and the radiation zero leaves a clear signature .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ wgamma ] where we display the distribution of the difference between the rapidities of the @xmath8 boson , @xmath16 , and the photon , @xmath17 .",
    "the dip at @xmath18 is due to the radiation zero @xcite .",
    "the boost invariant quantity @xmath19 contains the same information as the @xmath20 distribution .",
    "the @xmath19 distribution is very similar to the distribution of the rapidity difference between the photon and the charged lepton originating from the @xmath8 decay , which can be readily observed .",
    "this is due to the @xmath21 nature of the @xmath8 fermion antifermion coupling and the fact that @xmath8 s in @xmath4 production in the sm are strongly polarized : the dominant helicity of the @xmath22 boson in sm @xmath23 production is @xmath24 .",
    "in this section we briefly review the classical radiation zeros , which in fact are the limiting case of the so called type  i zeros in quantum field theory , which will be discussed in the next section @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the electromagnetic radiation originating from a dipole with dipole moment @xmath25 vanishes , if @xmath26    for particles with spin , the magnetic dipole moment is : @xmath27 if the constants @xmath28 are the same for all particles , the condition of eq .",
    "( [ eq : q / m ] ) is satisfied , and there are no external torques , @xmath29 no radiation occurs .    for the scattering of @xmath30 particles",
    ", the amplitude for photon radiation in the infrared limit can be written in the form @xmath31 where @xmath32 before ( after ) photon radiation . if @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the momentum of the photon , then @xmath35 from momentum conservation and the transversality condition @xmath36 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : relav ] ) we observe that the condition for a radiation zero in the case of the scattering of relativistic particles via the dot product in the denominator exhibits a dependence on the scattering angle of the photon .",
    "the amplitude zero observed in @xmath4 production belongs to the family of so - called `` type  i '' zeros which can be explained as a consequence of the factorization of the amplitude , shown soon after they were first discussed in the literature @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the scattering amplitude for the above mentioned process can be obtained starting from the vertices which describe the interaction of the charged particles , attach a photon to each charged particle leg in turn and add all diagrams , as schematically depicted below : one can show that the amplitude ( for particles of any spin ) can be written in the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are factors which depend on the charge and polarization .",
    "@xmath40 represent the particle propagators .",
    "this leads to the factorization of the amplitude into separately charge dependent and polarization dependent factors : @xmath41 the factorization of the amplitudes holds for any _ * gauge theory based vertex * _ with no restriction on the number of particles , due to the relation between the photon ( gauge boson ) coupling and poincare invariance . for the complete tree level amplitude for a source graph @xmath42 consisting of a single vertex ( no internal lines ) @xmath43 the vertex currents @xmath44 which depend on the polarizations , but not on the charges of the particles obey the identity @xmath45 for all yang - mills type vertices , as a result of momentum conservation , lorentz invariance and the bianchi identity .",
    "thus the vertex amplitude @xmath46 vanishes if @xmath47 similar to the classical case ( @xmath48 )",
    ". the well - known radiation zero occurring in @xmath4 production belongs to this type .",
    "since @xmath49 , the amplitude @xmath46 will be zero , if @xmath50 or @xmath51 these zeros correspond to the @xmath52 @xcite .    from the conditions above we see that the null zones connect intrinsic ( charge , spin ) and space - time properties ( poincare transformation ) of the particles involved .",
    "this makes it possible to use them in analyzing the structure of the sm .",
    "radiation zeros can also be explained as a consequence of the decoupling theorem  @xcite .",
    "the wave function of a system of particles in an external yang - mills field can be written as @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the free solution of the field equations ( @xmath55 , no gauge boson emission ) , and @xmath56 is the product of the local gauge ( @xmath57 ) , lorentz ( @xmath58 ) , and displacement ( @xmath59 ) transformations .",
    "the null zone condition @xmath60 leads to the charge null condition discussed above .    from the condition for the charge null zone",
    "we conclude that ( since @xmath61 ) @xmath62 notice that the zeros will not necessarily be in the physical range of the parameters ( @xmath63 in the case discussed here ) .    in @xmath64 scattering processes , where one of the final particles is a massless , neutral gauge boson , in the relativistic limit",
    ", the zeros occur at the angle @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the charges of the initial state particles .    for the reaction",
    "@xmath68 we indeed get @xmath69 , consistent with the result from a direct computation of the matrix elements .",
    "the presence of amplitude zeros also requires a gyro - magnetic factor of @xmath70 .",
    "any anomalous @xmath71 coupling changes the value of @xmath72 and destroys the radiation zero .",
    "amplitude zeros can be observed in many interesting reactions . in this section",
    "we discuss several examples .",
    "a radiation zero exists not only when one massless neutral gauge boson is emitted , but also if two or more are radiated , provided that the neutral gauge bosons are all collinear @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the radiation zero is located at the same scattering angle as in the case where only one boson is radiated .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ waa_wz_zeros]a where we show the squared amplitude as a function of the photon scattering angle for @xmath73 production at @xmath74  gev .",
    "a @xmath75  gev cut has been imposed to avoid the infrared singularities associated with photon emission .    in the case of massive neutral gauge bosons ,",
    "the radiation zero will have an approximate character . only some of the amplitudes will exhibit a true zero , which is weakly energy dependent .",
    "[ waa_wz_zeros]b shows the @xmath76 squared helicity amplitude for @xmath77 and @xmath78 where @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) is the helicity of the @xmath8 ( @xmath81 ) boson @xcite .    [ cols= \"",
    "> , > \" , ]     similar to @xmath3 production , the amplitudes for @xmath1 production exhibit an approximate radiation zero if the two @xmath81 bosons are collinear .",
    "it leads to a dip in the @xmath82 distribution , which , however , is much less pronounced than the corresponding dip in the @xmath83 distribution in @xmath0 production .",
    "a comparison of the two distributions at the lhc is shown in fig .",
    "[ wzgh_wzzh ] .",
    "only the helicity amplitudes which give the dominating contributions to the cross section have been taken into account here .",
    "the radiation zeros can be used for testing the models beyond the sm @xcite-@xcite . any anomalous coupling term added to",
    "the lagrangian causes the dips originating from the amplitude zeros to be washed out . in fig .",
    "[ wzg_a ] we show how an anomalous coupling described by the effective lagrangian @xmath84 with @xmath85 affects the @xmath82 distribution in @xmath1 production @xcite .",
    "radiation zeros are a consequence of the factorization of tree level amplitudes in the sm .",
    "the zeros occur for processes where one or more neutral , massless gauge bosons are radiated . if the emitted gauge boson is massive , only some of the helicity amplitudes exhibit zeros .",
    "radiation zeros leave deep measurable dips in rapidity difference distributions for many hadron collider processes , such as @xmath4 , @xmath3 , @xmath1 and @xmath0 production .",
    "since anomalous coupling terms destroy the radiation zeros , they can be used for probing the sm .",
