    "magnesium diboride owes its high critical temperatures of 40 k @xcite to the interplay between two distinct electronic bands crossing the fermi level .",
    "about half of the quasiparticles belongs to the quasi two - dimensional hole @xmath3 band and the cooper pairs there are strongly coupled via the boron vibrational mode @xmath4 .",
    "the rest of the quasiparticles resides in the three - dimensional @xmath2 band with a rather moderate electron - phonon interaction . without the effect from the @xmath3-band",
    "the transition temperature @xmath5 would be just a fraction of those found in the real mgb@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the two band superconductivity is the most spectacularly revealed by the presence of two very distinguished energy gaps , large in the @xmath3 and small in the @xmath2 bands @xcite .",
    "superconducting properties of such a system are sensitive to the scattering . due to coexistence of charge carriers from two almost completely separated bands two _ intraband _ and one _ interband _ scattering channels have to be distinguished .",
    "the _ interband _ scattering by non magnetic scatterers is supposed to have a particularly strong effect in a two - band superconductor : it will blend the strongly and weakly coupled quasiparticles , merge two gaps and consequently decrease @xmath5 . in the case of mgb@xmath0 @xmath5 can drop down to about 20 k @xcite .",
    "fortunately , a different symmetry of the bands ensures that the interband scattering remains small also in very dirty mgb@xmath0 samples which show about the same @xmath5 as the purest material @xcite .",
    "a systematic decrease of @xmath5 is achieved in substituted mgb@xmath0 samples .",
    "the only on site substitutions by non magnetic elements which are known so far are carbon for boron and aluminium for magnesium .",
    "the carbon and aluminium atoms in mgb@xmath0 take indeed a role of scatterers but they also dope the system with one extra electron which inevitably leads to the filling effect in the @xmath3 band , with strongly coupled holes . recently ,",
    "@xcite have introduced a model incorporating both effects : interband scattering and band filling in mgb@xmath0 .",
    "the former effect leads to an increase of the small gap @xmath6 and decrease of the large @xmath7 while the latter suppresses both @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "there is a rather controversial situation as far as the strength of both effects in the al and c - doped mgb@xmath0 is concerned @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the interband scattering an increase of the scattering within the bands does not have any effect on the two gaps .",
    "but , the selective tuning of the _ intraband _ scattering can lead to the expressive variation of the values of the upper critical magnetic field @xmath8 and its anisotropy @xcite . upon increased c - doping @xmath8 is increased significantly in both principal crystallographic directions ( parallel to the @xmath9 hexagonal boron layers and the @xmath10-axis direction ) . on the other hand al substitution",
    "suppresses @xmath11(0 ) in the @xmath9-plane direction and in the @xmath10-axis direction @xmath11 is hardly changed .",
    "this difference behavior is due to a different influence of c- and al - doping on intraband scatterings .",
    "while the strong increase of @xmath8 with the c - doping is due to graded dirty limit conditions , al - doped samples stays still in the clean limit and the decrease of @xmath11 is just a consequence of the lower @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "a weight of scatterings in separated bands is still not clear .    in this paper",
    "we present the systematic study of the superconducting energy gaps in both al- and c - doped magnesium diborid systems at stoichiometries mg@xmath12al@xmath13b@xmath0 with @xmath14 and 0.2 and mg(b@xmath15c@xmath16)@xmath0 with @xmath17 and 0.1 . for",
    "the carbon doping this work is a supplement to our previous studies @xcite on mg(b@xmath15c@xmath16)@xmath0 with @xmath18 and 0.1 .",
    "the influence of both substitutions for the scattering processes is discussed .",
    "polycrystalline samples of al - doped mgb@xmath0 have been prepared by a two step synthesis at high temperatures as mg@xmath19al@xmath20b@xmath0 and mg@xmath21al@xmath22b@xmath0 with @xmath5 = 30.5 k and 23.5 k , resp . @xcite .",
    "the carbon substituted samples mg(b@xmath23c@xmath16)@xmath0 with @xmath24 and with the respective transitions at @xmath5 = 39 k , 33 k , 28.2 k , and 22 k , were synthesized in the form of pellets following the procedure described in ref.@xcite from magnesium lumps and b@xmath25c powder .",
    "for @xmath26 we have worked with the wire segments with @xmath5 = 39 k , 37.5 k , and 36.2 k @xcite .",
    "the undoped mgb@xmath0 sample with @xmath27 k in a dirty limit with the high upper critial field has been prepared from boron and magnesium powder as described elsewhere @xcite    the point - contact ( pc ) measurements have been realized via the standard lock - in technique in a special point - contact approaching system with lateral and vertical movements of the pc tip by a differential screw mechanism .",
    "the microconstrictions were prepared in situ by pressing different metallic tips ( copper and platinum formed either mechanically or by electrochemical etching ) on different parts of the freshly polished surface of the superconductor .",
    "point - contact measurements on the wire segments have been performed in a `` reversed '' configuration - with the mg(b@xmath12c@xmath13)@xmath0 wire as a tip touching softly a bulk piece of electrochemically cleaned copper .",
    "s in both series of substitutions have been determined from the resistive transitions and also from the temperature dependences of the point - contact spectra .",
    "the transition temperatures found by both methods were essentially the same , indicating that the information obtained from a more surface sensitive point - contact technique is relevant also for the bulk .    the point - contact spectrum measured on the ballistic microconstriction between a normal metal ( n ) and a superconductor ( s ) consist of the andreev reflection ( ar ) contribution and the tunneling contribution @xcite .",
    "the charge transfer through a barrierless metallic point - contact is realized via the andreev reflection of carriers .",
    "consequently at @xmath280 the pc current as well as the pc conductance inside the gap voltage ( @xmath29 ) is twice higher than the respective values at higher energies ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the presence of the tunneling barrier reduces the conductance at the zero bias and two symmetrically located peaks rise at the gap energy . the evolution of the point - contact spectra between the pure andreev reflection and the giaver - like tunnelling case has been theoretically described by the blonder - tinkham - klapwijk ( btk ) theory @xcite .",
    "the point - contact conductance data can be compared with this theory using as input parameters the energy gap @xmath31 , the parameter @xmath32 ( measure for the strength of the interface barrier ) and a parameter @xmath33 for the spectral broadening @xcite . in any case",
    "the voltage dependence of the n / s point - contact conductance gives direct spectroscopic information on the superconducting order parameter @xmath31 .",
    "for the two - gap mgb@xmath0 superconductor the point - contact conductance @xmath34 can be expressed as a weighted sum of two partial btk conductances : those from the quasi two - dimensional @xmath3-band ( with a large gap @xmath35 ) and those from the 3d @xmath2-band ( with a small gap @xmath6 ) @xmath36 the weight factor @xmath37 for the @xmath38 - band contribution can vary from 0.6 for the point - contact current strictly in the mgb@xmath0 @xmath9-plane to 0.99 of @xmath10-axis direction @xcite .",
    "a large number of the point - contact measurements have been performed on the tested samples of pure mgb@xmath0 and both substituted series .",
    "the point contacts revealed different barrier transparencies changing from more metallic interfaces to intermediate barriers with @xmath39 for the aluminium doped serie and @xmath40 for the c - doped samples . by trial and error",
    "we looked for the spectra showing both gaps of a polycrystalline specimen . for more detailed studies we chose those junctions revealing the spectra with a low spectral broadening @xmath33 ,",
    "i.e. with an intensive signal in the normalized pc conductance . as a result we succeeded to obtain many point contact spectra with well resolved two superconducting gaps directly in the row data for all of the studied substitutions except for the highest dopings , mg@xmath19al@xmath20b@xmath0 and mg(b@xmath21c@xmath22)@xmath0 .",
    "figure 1 displays the representative spectra of the aluminium doped serie and fig .",
    "2 resumes the results for the carbon doped mgb@xmath0 .",
    "the experimental data are presented by the full lines , while the fits to the two - gap formula are indicated by the open circles .",
    "all shown point - contact spectra have been normalized to the spectra measured in the normal state at a temperature above @xmath5 .",
    "the upper curves are shifted for the clarity .",
    "the retention of two gaps for all dopings apart from the highest substitution is evident .",
    "for the highest dopings ( always with a larger spectral broadening , @xmath41 ) , the spectra in figs . 1 and 2 reveal only one pair of peaks without an apparent shoulder at the expected position of the second gap . for those data measured at 1.6 k ( the rest of tha data was measured at 4.2 k ) also the one - gap fit is presented .",
    "the one - gap fit can reproduce either the height of the peaks or the width of them , while the two - gap fit can reproduce both .",
    "the size of the apparent gap is well indicated by the peak position , which is about 2 mev for mg@xmath19al@xmath20b@xmath0 and 1.6 mev for mg(b@xmath21c@xmath22)@xmath0 .",
    "but , this size is too small to explain the superconductivity with the respective @xmath5 s equal to 23.5 k and 22 k within the single - gap bcs scenario suggesting , that we are dealing with a smeared two - gap structure . in the case of the 10% c - doped mgb@xmath0 an existence of the large gap was clearly shown by the specific heat mesurements @xcite .",
    "moreover , an existence of the both gaps was strongly evidenced in a single experiment by our previous point - contact spectroscopy measurements in applied magnetic field @xcite . there , the spectrum at @xmath42 = 0.7 t showed that the contribution from the @xmath2 band was partially suppressed and the large - gap shoulder clearly appeared near 3 mv besides the gap peak at 1.6 mv .",
    "a similar effect has the magnetic field in the case of 20 % al doped mgb@xmath0 : as shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "5 , the peak position being at about 2 mv in zero field , is shifted towards 3 mv at 1 tesla . in the case of a single - gap superconductor",
    "the application of magnetic field can only lead to a shrinkage of the distance between the peak positions in the point - contact spectrum .",
    "it is a simple consequence of an introduction of the vortices and magnetic pair - breaking @xcite .",
    "the shift of the peak of the pc spectra to higher voltages demonstrated in fig .",
    "5 is then due to an interplay between the two gaps , because the dominance of the @xmath6 peak at zero field is suppressed in increasing field and @xmath7 contributes more .",
    "thus , the retention of two gaps is proved in the all presented doped mgb@xmath0 samples with @xmath5 s from 39 down to 22 k.    al@xmath13b@xmath0 with @xmath43 0 , 0.1 and 0.2 - solid lines .",

    "the left coordinates indicate the transition temperature of the junctions , while the right one counts the number of junctions with the same size of the gaps .",
    "the energy width of a particular count indicates the fitting uncertainty .",
    "all the samples , the undoped mgb@xmath0 as well as the aluminium and carbon doped material reveal a certain distribution of the small and large gaps but the two gaps are well distinguishable in the histogram and no overlap of @xmath7 and @xmath6 is observed .",
    "already from this figure a general tendency is evident , namely that the reduction of the large gap is proportional to the decreasing transition temperature . on the other hand",
    "the changes in the small gap are proportionally smaller .",

    "the points ( open squares for al dopings and solid circles for c ones ) are positioned at the averaged energies of the gap distributions from fig . 3 and the error bars represent the standard deviations .",
    "the large gap @xmath7 is essentially decreased linearly with the respective @xmath5 s .",
    "the behavior of @xmath6 s is more complicated . for both kind of substitutions",
    "the gap is almost unchanged at smaller dopings . in the case of c",
    "- doped mgb@xmath0 it holds clearly down to @xmath45 33 k. in ( mg , al)b@xmath0 @xmath6 of the 10 % al doped sample seems to even slightly increase .",
    "but for the highest dopings @xmath6 decreases in both doping cases . the dashed lines in fig .",
    "4 are calculations of kortus _",
    "@xcite for the case of a pure band filling effect and no interband scattering .",
    "although , the constant @xmath6 is not reproduced , the @xmath5 dependence of @xmath31 s for carbon doping are broadly well described .",
    "the solid lines show the kortus s calculations including the interband scattering with the rate @xmath46@xmath47 ( or @xmath48@xmath47 ) . as can be seen the gaps in the al doped samples",
    "can not be accounted without an interband scattering but it is smaller than in the presented calculations .",
    "recently , similar results on the superconducting energy gaps have been obtained on the al - doped single crystals by some of us and other authors @xcite exploring the specific heat as well as the point contact spectroscopy measurements .",
    "those data also show a tendency of approaching of the two gaps with their possible merging in the al - doped samples with @xmath5 below 10 - 15 k. it is worth noticing that those and here presented results do not show any decrease of the large gap below the canonical bcs value for the al - doped mgb@xmath0 with @xmath5 s below 30 k found earlier @xcite .    for the carbon doped samples we have not found any stronger tendency to blend both gaps down to @xmath49k , being in contrast with the data obtained on single crystals by gonnelli _",
    "_ @xcite . on the other hand",
    "our data are very compatible with the recent arpes measurements of tsuda _ et al . _ where both gaps have been directly seen in the row data down to @xmath5 of 23 k. a presence of two gaps is also evidenced by the point contact measurements of schmidt _ et al . _",
    "@xcite on the heavily carbon doped mgb@xmath0 .",
    "we remark that the data showing no merging of the gaps on the heavily doped mgb@xmath0 with @xmath5 down to 22 k have been collected from the measurements on the samples of different forms ( wires , sintered pellets , polycrystals ) prepared by different methods .",
    "moreover it is very important that two gaps have been directly experimentally evidenced in the row data without any dependece on the model or fit .",
    "the theoretical calculations of erwin and mazin @xcite on merging of the gaps due to a substitution are also supporting the picture presented here . by them the carbon substitution on the boron site should have zero effect on the merging of the gaps .",
    "it is due to the fact that a replacing boron by carbon does not change the local point symmetry in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 orbitals which are both centered at the boron sites .",
    "then , the interband scattering is of little probability without incorporating extra defects producing a change of the symmetry of orbitals . on the other hand much bigger effect",
    "is expected for the out of plane substitutions ( al instead of mg ) or defects which would indeed change the local point symmetry .",
    "the substitution of al instead of mg leads also to a significant decrease of the @xmath10-lattice parameter @xcite ( it is basically nullite in case of carbon doping ) , which helps the interlayer hopping from a @xmath50 orbital ( @xmath2-band ) in one atomic layer to a @xmath3 bond orbital in the next one .",
    "of coarse , a particular strength of the interband scattering can scatter among samples due to deffect and thus the merging of two gaps could be sample dependent .      in the following we present the effect of magnetic field on the point contact spectra of the aluminium as well as carbon doped mgb@xmath0 samples .",
    "the field effect has been measured on a number of samples of each substitution .",
    "the field was always oriented perpendicularly to the sample surface and parallel with the tip having the point contact area in the vortex state .",
    "figure 5 displays the typical magnetic field dependences of the pc spectra ( lines ) obtained on mg@xmath51al@xmath13b@xmath0 samples with x = 0 , 0.1 and 0.2 .",
    "the zero - field spectrum of the undoped mgb@xmath0 ( bottom panel ) reveals an expressive two - gap structure . at small fields",
    "the peak corresponding to the small gap @xmath6 is very rapidly suppressed and only the peak responsible for the large gap @xmath7 is apparently visible above 1 tesla . at 10 % of al doping",
    "the zero field spectra also show both gaps but the large one is now revealed more as a pronounced shoulder .",
    "again at a small magnetic field the @xmath2-band - gap peak is rapidly suppressed but its signature is still distinguishable at 0.5 tesla . at higher fields the signatures of both gaps",
    "are not resolvable due to an interference of the related peaks placed at closed positions .",
    "the resulting maximum is located in the intermedium position between them . at the highest doping ( 20 @xmath52 al )",
    "such an interference of even closer gaps is graduated , so already at zero magnetic field one can see only one pair of peaks at the position of the small gap ( it has always much higher weight at zero field ) and a minor shoulder at the voltage of the large one . in the increasing field",
    "the peak is broadened and its position shifted to higher voltages ( indicated by arrows ) . as mentioned above the shift is an indication of two gaps present in the spectrum with an increasing weight of the large - gap peak with respect to the small one .",
    "the in - field measurements have also been performed on the carbon doped samples . in our previous paper @xcite",
    "they have been demonstrated on the heavily doped , 10 % c mgb@xmath0 sample .    in two sets of measurements and subsequent analysis on the aluminum and carbon doped samples",
    "two different types of undoped mgb@xmath0 samples have been used .",
    "the carbon doping increases the upper critical fields @xcite despite the decreased @xmath5 and both superconducting gaps .",
    "thus , these samples are driven to the dirty limit by doping .",
    "that is why we compare the 6.5 % and 10 % c - doped samples with the undoped mgb@xmath0 crystal being already in a dirty limit ( @xmath53 k , @xmath54 t ) @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the aluminum doping leads only to a decrease of @xmath11 for the field in @xmath9 planes or a constant value in perpendicular orientation with @xmath55 t @xcite , so we have chosen the pure mgb@xmath0 sample with @xmath56 k and @xmath57 t as a reference .    from the in - field spectra",
    "the excess current @xmath58 has been determined .",
    "it was calculated by integrating the pc spectra after subtracting an area below unity .",
    "when a single gap superconductor is in the vortex state , each vortex core represents a normal state region and this region /",
    "vortex density increases linearly up to the upper critical magnetic field .",
    "thus , the pc excess current ( @xmath59 ) is reduced linearly in increasing magnetic field by the factor of @xmath60 , where @xmath61 represents a normal state region - the pc junction area covered by the vortex cores .",
    "the field dependences of the excess currents @xmath58 obtained on the carbon and aluminum doped samples are shown in fig .",
    "6a and 6b , respectively .",
    "the magnetic field coordinates have been normalized to an appropriate @xmath62 referred to as @xmath63 @xcite . in a none case the linear decrease of @xmath58 was observed . on the contrary ,",
    "a strong non - linearity observed in all curves approves a presence of two gaps in the quasiparticle spectrum of the material .",
    "there , a more rapid fall of @xmath64 at low magnetic fields is ascribed to a strong filling of the @xmath2-band gap states up to a virtual / crossover @xmath2-band upper critical field @xmath65 .",
    "then , at higher fields , the low temperature superconductivity is maintained mainly by the @xmath3-band @xcite , with the @xmath3 gap getting filled smoothly up to the real upper critical field of the material @xmath66 .",
    "due to a small , but finite coupling of the two bands , the superconductivity is maintained also in the @xmath2-band above @xmath65 , but , as shown e.g. in the tunneling data of eskildsen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , the @xmath2-gap states are filled much more slowly than in the low field region . a magnitude of the upper critical fields of two bands can be estimated in the clean limit @xcite as @xmath67 and @xmath68 , with @xmath69 or @xmath70 for the fermi velocity of the respective band ( since only @xmath62 is considered the anisotropy due to an effective mass tensor is neglected ) .",
    "a similar estimates can be done in the dirty limit when taking into account the respecive diffussion coefficients @xmath71 .",
    "6a shows that the carbon doping leads to changes in the field dependence of the excess current .",
    "the undoped mgb@xmath0 reveals a very steep fall of @xmath58 already at small fields indicating also proportionally small crossover field @xmath65 . by doping the @xmath2-band crossover field",
    "apparently shifts to higher values . from the previous subsection",
    "we know that the carbon doping does not influence significantly the interband scattering in mgb@xmath0 .",
    "the ratio between the two gaps , @xmath72 remains almost unchanged .",
    "then , following from the dirty limit theory the shift of the normalized crossover field @xmath73 is due to an increase of the ratio of the diffussion coeficients @xmath74 .",
    "this is an indication that the carbon doping leads to a significant enhancement of the @xmath2-band scattering .    in fig .",
    "6b the excess currents on the aluminum doped samples show different picture : there is no change in the field dependence of @xmath58 upon the aluminum doping up to 20 % indicating constant value of the crossover field @xmath65 .",
    "qualitatively , it can be understood in the framework of the clean limit persisting in the al - doped mgb@xmath0 up to 20 % al doping region .",
    "indeed , the constant value of the upper critical field @xmath62 , which is equal to approximately 3 tesla for all three dopings , indicates the constant ratio between @xmath7 and @xmath70 .",
    "it means that the electron filling of the hole @xmath3-band decreases both quantities proportionally .",
    "then , @xmath75 must be only weakly doping dependent . as @xmath76 and @xmath6 remains almost constant for x",
    "= 0.1 and 0.2 this would suggest that @xmath77 remains also unchanged .",
    "quantitatively , @xmath58 of the two - gap superconductor in the mixed state can be described by the sum @xcite @xmath78    for the point - contact conductance a similar expression can be written @xmath79g_{\\pi }                                         + ( 1-\\alpha)[n_{\\sigma}+(1-n_{\\sigma})]g_{\\sigma}.\\ ] ]    considering that @xmath80 and @xmath81 represent independent fillings of the respective gaps in increasing applied field , their values can be identified with the values of the zero - energy density of states ( dos ) @xmath82 and @xmath83 averaged over the vortex lattice .",
    "this model proposed by bugoslavsky _",
    "_ @xcite enables a direct experimental determination of the field dependent energy gaps and zero - energy dos @xmath84 from the point - contact spectra in mgb@xmath0 .",
    "the calculations of koshelev and golubov @xcite show that the low field slope of @xmath82 is controlled by an important parameter @xmath74 which can thus be established .",
    "unfortunately the fitting of the pc conductance of mgb@xmath0 in the mixed state is not trivial because of too many ( 9 ) parameters . moreover",
    "two pairs of the parameters @xmath85 vs. @xmath86 and @xmath87 vs. @xmath88 manifest very similarly in the fit . hence , before fitting the spectra by the formula ( 3 ) we estimate @xmath82 values from the excess currents . here",
    "some simplifications were made : if the real upper critical field @xmath11 is large compared to @xmath65 , in the region @xmath89 the suppression of the @xmath3 band contribution by the field can be neglected ( @xmath90 .",
    "if we also neglect a small reduction of the energy gaps at these fields @xcite , then @xmath91 can be represented by a single parameter formula expressed as @xmath92 since all other parameters ( @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath37 ) have already been determined from the btk fit at @xmath95 .",
    "the resulting @xmath82 is later used as a first approximation in the fit of the pc conductance spectrum . there , also",
    "the values of @xmath96 and @xmath97 determined from btk fits at @xmath98 are kept unchanged . in the second step",
    "all parameters except for @xmath99 and @xmath37 are adjusted for the best fit .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath82 are decreased by 5 - 20% in comparison with the first estimate from @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "also the values of the smearing parameters @xmath100 and @xmath97 reveal about @xmath101 of increase in the interval @xmath102 t accounting for the magnetic pair - breaking of the superconducing dos . in the same field interval a small @xmath103 ) suppression of the values of the energy gaps has been obtained .",
    "the resulting zero - energy dos @xmath82 and @xmath83 are plotted in fig.6c for the carbon - doped samples and in fig.6d for the al - substituted mgb@xmath0 .",
    "again , the carbon and aluminium dopings reveal very differently . the steep increase of @xmath104 in the undoped mgb@xmath0 can be ascribed within the framework of the dirty superconductivity model @xcite to a small value of the ratio of in - plane diffusivities @xmath105 ( see dotted line , calculated for @xmath106 ) .",
    "it means a dirtier @xmath3-band than the @xmath2-one .",
    "the subsequent decrease of the low field slope of @xmath104 upon c - doping can be explained by an increase of the @xmath107 ratio , i.e. by a more rapid enhancement of the @xmath2-band intraband scattering as compared with the scattering in the @xmath3-band .",
    "the dashed line plots the theoretical @xmath104 dependence at @xmath108    the situation is different for the al - doping . here",
    "the field dependences of @xmath104 reveal no change upon doping .",
    "the same explanation as used above for the excess current versus field can be applied , underlying the conservation of the superconducting clean limit for al doping .",
    "the influence of carbon and aluminium doping on the two - band / two - gap superconductivity in mg@xmath109 has been studied by the point - contact spectroscopy .",
    "it has been shown , that the decreased transition temperatures and the evolution of the gaps upon both substitutions is mainly a consequence of the band filling effect . however , in the case of an increased al - doping also an increase of the interband scattering has to be taken into account . by the analysis of the field dependences of the point - contact spectra we have shown , that the c - doping increases the scattering in the @xmath2-band more rapidly then in the @xmath3 one . on the other hand , the al - doping does not introduce significant changes in the relative weight of the scatterings within two bands .",

    "<S> two gaps are preserved in all samples with @xmath1 down to 22 k. the evolution of two gaps as a function of the critical temperature in the doped systems suggest the dominance of the band - filling effects but for the increased al - doping the enhanced interband scattering approaching two gaps must be considered . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field dependences of the andreev reflection excess currents as well as zero - energy density of states determined from the experimental data are used to analyze the intraband scattering . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown , that while the c - doping increases the intraband scattering in the @xmath2-band more rapidly then in the @xmath3 band , the al - doping does not change their relative weight . </S>"
