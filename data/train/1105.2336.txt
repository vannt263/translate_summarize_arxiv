    "the rapid recent progress in circuit quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) @xcite has motivated the question of how superconducting microwave circuits can be interfaced with quantum optics technology for long - distance quantum information transfer .",
    "this task requires efficient and coherent frequency conversion between microwave and optical photons .",
    "existing proposals involve the use of mechanical oscillators as mediators between electrical and optical systems @xcite , but a more straightforward way is to take advantage of the well known pockels electro - optic effect in a noncentrosymmetric material , such as lithium niobate @xcite .",
    "the pockels effect is the change in the optical index of refraction of a material under an applied voltage .",
    "a pockels cell can be satisfactorily modeled as a broadband second - order nonlinear optical medium and a capacitor on the electrical side @xcite , so the effect is inherently coherent and suitable for quantum optics experiments , much like the use of second - order nonlinear crystals in optical parametric amplifiers and oscillators . in the classical regime ,",
    "high - quality cavity electro - optic modulators that can resonantly couple microwave and optical fields have been extensively studied and experimentally demonstrated @xcite , but a quantum analysis of the photon frequency conversion problem is still lacking .    in the previous paper @xcite , i have developed a quantum model of cavity electro - optic modulators that can be used to address the frequency conversion problem . while the previous paper focuses on the analogy between electro - optics and optomechanics and the interactions between resonator modes , the present paper studies the relations between the traveling microwave and optical fields coupled to the cavities and the conversion efficiencies in the presence of parasitic losses .",
    "i consider two modes of operations : red - sideband optical pumping and blue - sideband optical pumping .",
    "red - sideband pumping in the classical regime has been considered previously in refs .",
    "@xcite with the assumption that the microwave field is undepleted ; here i shall do a quantum analysis assuming that the optical pump is undepleted instead and allow the microwave fields and the up - converted optical fields to exchange energy .",
    "this process is shown to be a fundamentally noiseless operation resembling that of a variable beam - splitter , so that in the ideal case of zero parasitic loss and critical coupling , microwave photons can be coherently converted to optical photons with unit efficiency , and vice versa . with blue - sideband pumping ,",
    "the electro - optic modulator acts as a nondegenerate parametric amplifier , which can generate two - mode squeezing and hybrid entangled photon pairs at optical and microwave frequencies .",
    "given the fundamental importance of beam - splitters and parametric amplifiers in quantum optics @xcite , such operations enabled by the cavity electro - optic modulator should be similarly useful for future quantum optical interconnect technology , if the technical challenges of implementing a quantum - efficient cavity electro - optic modulator can be overcome .",
