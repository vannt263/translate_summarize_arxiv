    "recently intensive theoretical and experimental search for the ( tri-)critical endpoint of strongly interacting matter at small enough chemical potential become very fascinating and promising branches of research activity in the context of relativistic heavy ion programs of many laboratories . in particular ,",
    "the most powerful computers and very sophisticated algorithms are used for the lattice quantum chromodynamics ( lqcd ) simulations to locate this endpoint with maximal accuracy and to study its origin and properties @xcite , but despite these efforts the present results are still far from being conclusive .",
    "the general arguments for a similarity with the critical point features in the other substances are not much convincing mainly because of a lack of rigorous critical point theory which exists , in a sense , for the spin systems only @xcite , whereas the origin and physics of the critical point for realistic gases and nuclear matter are described , at best , phenomenologically .",
    "for example , the fisher droplet model ( fdm ) @xcite turns out rather efficient in studying the critical point of realistic gases .",
    "this model was applied to many different systems with the different extents of success including a nuclear multifragmentation @xcite , a nucleation of real fluids @xcite , the compressibility factor of real fluids @xcite , the clusters of the ising model @xcite and the percolation clusters @xcite , but really its phase diagram does not include the fluid at all and , therefore , is not completely satisfactory and theoretically well defined .",
    "the statistical multifragmentation model ( smm ) @xcite looks much more elaborated in this aspect because defines the phase diagram of the nuclear liquid - vapor type phase transition ( pt ) in some controlled approximation @xcite and predicts the critical ( tri - critical ) endpoint existence for the fisher exponent @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) @xcite together with giving the possibility to calculate the corresponding critical exponents @xcite .",
    "however , the predicted location of the smm ( tri-)critical endpoint at maximal density of the nuclear liquid does not seem to be quite realistic .",
    "actually , the relations between all these critical points are not well established yet . in principle , the complement method @xcite provides us with the possibility to describe accurately the size distribution of large clusters of 2- and 3-dimensional ising model within the fdm in rather wide temperature interval but the detailed numerical comparison of the ising model and the fdm critical endpoints is hardly possible because of the large fluctuations even in relatively small systems . in meantime , taking the formal limit of the vanishing nucleon proper volume leads to the situation in which the smm grand canonical partition function covers the fdm partition function , but the analytical properties are not the same and , as a result , the condensation particle density of gaseous phase is finite not for the fisher exponent @xmath2 , as in the smm , but for @xmath3 @xcite . besides , it leads to the various correlations between the @xmath4 exponent and other critical indices in the fdm @xcite and the corresponding relations in the smm are different what signals the universality classes for these models are different as well @xcite .    as to the model calculations of the qcd phase structure they are based on the universality arguments advanced in @xcite and concern mainly the temperature driven chiral symmetry restoration transition .",
    "in fact , it can not provide the reliable conclusion about the transition order at @xmath5 = 0 , its dependence on the number of flavors @xcite and especially about the location of the point ( tri - critical ) on the pt line where the transition changes its order .",
    "it seems the lattice qcd ( lqcd ) simulations at vanishing @xmath5 give more definite evidence that this temperature driven phenomenon could really be a crossover @xcite .",
    "then , clearly the @xmath6 phase diagram contains a critical point caused by the @xmath7 crossover turning into the first order pt .",
    "however , this wisdom is rather questionable as well @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the recent lqcd simulations @xcite teach us that even at high temperatures up to a few @xmath8 ( @xmath8 is the cross - over temperature ) , a qgp does not consist of the weakly interacting quarks and gluons and its pressure and energy density are well below of the corresponding quantities of non - interacting quarks and gluons .",
    "although such a strongly coupled qgp ( sqgp ) @xcite has put a new framework for the qcd phenomenology , the feasibility of understanding such a behavior within the ads / cft duality@xcite or statistical approaches is far from being simple and transparent .",
    "here we investigate the possibility to resolve the problem by formulating an approach based on the model of quark - gluon bags with surface tension ( qgbstm ) @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "ii contains the formulation of model basic elements ( hereafter the model is named qgbstm2 in order to distinguish it from the model with the tri - critical endpoint ) . in sect.iii",
    "we analyze all possible singularities of the qgbstm2 isobaric partition for non - vanishing baryonic densities and discuss the necessary conditions for the critical point existence . the conclusion are summarized in sect.iv .",
    "the most convenient way to study the phase structure of the qgbstm is to use the isobaric partition @xcite analyzing its rightmost singularities .",
    "hence , we assume that after the laplace transform the qgbstm2 grand canonical partition @xmath9 generates the following isobaric one : @xmath10 } \\ , , % \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the function @xmath11 includes @xcite the discrete @xmath12 and continuous @xmath13 volume spectra of the bags @xmath14   } \\ , .",

    "the term @xmath23 describes the hard - core repulsion of the van der waals type .",
    "@xmath24 denotes the ratio between the @xmath25 and @xmath5 dependent surface tension coefficient and @xmath25 ( the reduced surface tension coefficient hereafter ) which has the form @xmath26 at making choice in favour of such a simple surface energy parameterization we follow the original fisher idea @xcite which allows one to account for the surface energy by considering a mean bag of volume @xmath27 and surface extent @xmath28 . as it has been discussed in @xcite",
    "the power @xmath29 inherent in bag effective surface is a constant which , in principle , is different from the typical fdm and smm value @xmath30 .",
    "let us stress here that we do not require the precise disappearance of @xmath31 above the critical endpoint as it is usual in fdm and smm .",
    "it was shown in @xcite and is argued here , this point is found crucial in formulating the statistical model with deconfining cross - over ( in contrast with previous efforts @xcite ) .",
    "we would like also to note the negative value of the reduced surface tension coefficient @xmath31 above the @xmath32-line in the @xmath33-plane should not be surprising .",
    "it is the well - known fact that in the grand canonical ensemble the surface tension coefficient includes the energy and entropy contributions which have the opposite signs @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath34 does not mean that the surface energy changes the sign , but it rather signals that the surface entropy contribution simply exceeds the surface energy part and results in the negative values of surface free energy . in other words ,",
    "the number of non - spherical bags of fixed volumes becomes so big that the boltzmann exponent which accounts for the energy `` costs '' of these bags does not provide their suppression anymore .",
    "such a situation is standard for the statistical ensembles with the fluctuating extensive characteristics ( the surface of fixed volume bag fluctuates around the mean value ) @xcite .    by construction",
    "the isobaric partition ( [ zs ] ) develops two types of singularities : the simple pole @xmath35 which is defined by the equation @xmath36 and in addition there appears an essential singularity @xmath37 which is defined by the point @xmath38 where the continuous part of spectrum @xmath39 ( [ fsq ] ) becomes divergent .",
    "this singularity is also defined by eq.([eqvi ] ) .",
    "usually the statistical models similar to qgbstm @xcite have the following structure of singularities .",
    "the pressure of low energy density phase ( confined ) @xmath40 is described by the simple pole @xmath41 which is the rightmost singularity of the isobaric partition ( [ zs ] ) , whereas the pressure of high energy density phase ( deconfined ) @xmath42 defines the system s pressure , if the essential singularity @xmath43 of this partition becomes the rightmost one ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "such an interplay of rightmost isobaric partition singularity and the pressure of the grand canonical ensemble is the typical feature of the laplace transform technique @xcite .",
    "the deconfinement pt occurs at the equilibrium line @xmath44 where both singularities match each other @xmath45 in this equation one can easily recognize the gibbs criterion for phase equilibrium .",
    "such a behavior of the rightmost singularities is shown in fig.1 .",
    "it was demonstrated in @xcite the deconfinement pt takes place if the phase equilibrium temperature ( [ eqvii ] ) is lower than the temperature of the null surface tension line ( [ sigma ] ) for the same value of baryonic chemical potential , i.e. @xmath46 , whereas at low values of @xmath5 the pt is degenerated into a cross - over because the line @xmath47 leaves the qgp phase to appear in the hadronic phase .",
    "the intersection point @xmath48 of these two lines @xmath49 is the tricritical endpoint @xcite since for @xmath50 and @xmath51 at the null surface tension line @xmath47 there exists the surface induced pt @xcite .",
    "the important element of our deliberation here is a way found out to get rid of the surface induced pt and to ` hide ' it inside the deconfining one . in order to demonstrate the result we assume the surface tension coefficient changes its sign exactly at the deconfinement pt line",
    ", i.e. for @xmath52 and @xmath53 one has @xmath49 while keeping the cross - over transition for @xmath54 similar to @xcite .",
    "the possibility to match these two pt lines was clear long ago , but a nontriviality is seen in the fact that an existence of both the critical endpoint at @xmath55 and the 1@xmath56 order deconfinement pt at @xmath57 is generated by an entire change of the rightmost singularity pattern .",

    "under adopted assumption the rightmost singularity in the qgbstm2 is always the simple pole since in the right hand side vicinity of @xmath70 the value of @xmath71 for @xmath72 .",
    "then the motion of singularities corresponds to fig . 2 in this situation .",
    "the question , however , appears whether such a behavior corresponds to pt . to clarify the point it is convenient to introduce the variable @xmath73 and to compare the @xmath25 derivative of the right most singularity @xmath74 below and @xmath75 above the pt line @xmath76 for the same magnitudes of @xmath5 . due to the relation between the system pressure @xmath77 and the rightmost singularity @xmath78 ,",

    "the higher order pt at the critical endpoint may exist for @xmath117",
    "here we presented new exactly solvable model , qgbstm2 , ( or even the class of models ) which develops the critical endpoint at @xmath48 .",
    "this model naturally explains the transformation of the 1@xmath56 order deconfining pt into a weaker pt at the endpoint and into a cross - over at low baryonic densities as driven by negative surface tension coefficient of the qgp bags at high energy densities .",
    "it sheds new light on the qgp equation of state suggested in ref.@xcite where it has been shown that the deconfined qgp phase presents itself just a single infinite bag whereas the cross - over phase consists of the qgp bags of all possible volumes and only at very high pressure values this phase is presented by one large ( infinite ) bag .",
    "the important consequence of such a property is that the deconfined qgp phase should be separated from the cross - over qgp by another pt which is induced by the change of surface tension coefficient sign of large bags .",
    "furthermore , qgbstm teaches us that for the fisher exponent the 1@xmath56 order deconfinement pt exists for @xmath118 only , whereas at the endpoint there exists the 2@xmath116 order pt for @xmath119 and this point is the tri - critical one .    on the other hand",
    "the important message of qgbstm2 is that a solvable model of the qcd critical endpoint can be formulated for @xmath120 .",
    "technically it is achieved by matching the deconfinement pt line with the line of vanishing surface tension coefficient @xmath121 for @xmath50 and @xmath53 .",
    "this step leads to new strong assertion that the 1@xmath56 order pt in qgbstm2 is not accompanied by change of the leading singularity type as was argued earlier in refs .",
    "thus , the high density qgp phase is defined by not an essential singularity of the isobaric partition ( [ zs ] ) but its simple pole .",
    "similar to qgbstm the high density phase of this model is defined by the qgp crossover whereas the deconfined matter ( an interior of single infinite bag ) may exist at the mixed phase inherent in the deconfinement pt only .",
    "besides we find also that the 1@xmath56 order deconfining pt , i.e. a discontinuity of the first derivative of a system pressure , which is a three - dimensional quantity , is generated by the discontinuity of surface tension coefficient derivative , which is a two - dimensional quantity .",
    "thus , we explicitly show that within the present model the deconfinement 1@xmath56 order pt is the surface induced one .",
    "+ another distinctive feature of these results is that for the first time we see the critical endpoint in the model with the constituents of nonzero proper volume exists not for @xmath122 as in the smm @xcite and not for @xmath123 as the tricritical endpoints in the smm and in the qgbstm @xcite , but for @xmath120 , i.e. as in fdm @xcite .",
    "perhaps , this feature may be helpful to distinguish experimentally the qcd critical endpoint from the tri - critical one .",
