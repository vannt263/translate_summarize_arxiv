    "gravitational microlensing as a means to detect compact objects in the galactic halo was first considered by paczyski ( 1986 ) , but the basic idea is much older ( einstein 1936 ) .",
    "this suggestion was realized as results from two surveys of microlensing events towards the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc ) ( alcock et al .",
    "2000 ; ansari et al .",
    "these were consistent with a significant , but subdominant , contribution of microlensing masses to the galactic dark matter halo . nonetheless , these conclusions are still controversial , and the identity and location of the microlensing masses are still mysterious .",
    "a decade ago , m31 was suggested as a promising venue where galactic microlensing might be explored in ways advantageous and distinctive from that in and around the galaxy ( crotts 1992 ) .",
    "several papers ( jetzer 1994 ; han & gould 1996 ; baltz & silk 2000 ; kerins et al .",
    "2001 ) have confirmed that a substantial microlensing signal can be expected .",
    "two collaborations , mega ( preceded by the vatt / columbia survey ) and agape have produced a number of microlensing event candidates involving stars in m31 ( crotts & tomaney 1996 , ansari et al .",
    "1999 , aurire et al .  2001 , uglesich 2001 ,",
    "calchi novati et al .",
    "2002 ) . here",
    "we show the potential for these and future surveys to settle some of the outstanding questions regarding microlensing in spiral galaxies .",
    "this is the second paper in a series .",
    "paper i ( gyuk & crotts 2000 ) provides optical depth maps for m31 . while these are useful tools for certain purposes they are unfortunately not directly measurable .",
    "event rates on the other hand _ are _ directly measurable and hence their magnitude and variation across the face of m31 are more meaningful in planning and evaluating surveys of microlensing . in this paper",
    "we extend paper i to include event rate maps , both total and also differential rates with respect to the event timescale .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  [ model ]",
    "we briefly discuss the m31 models we used , including disk , bulge and halo components . following this we present rate maps for various halo models , including the self lensing contribution , in ",
    "[ ratemaps ] . in  [ timescales ]",
    "we provide differential rate distributions as a function of two different timescale measures , and we discuss how cuts in timescale can be used to separate self lensing from a macho halo contribution to the lensing rate .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of measuring lens masses and halo properties in ",
    "[ discussion ] .",
    "the execution of a microlensing survey of m31 is qualitatively different from those towards the magellanic clouds or our own galactic bulge . for the latter , individual stars",
    "can often be resolved , and their unlensed fluxes measured , admitting a direct measurement of the magnification during a microlensing event .",
    "in contrast , m31 is more than ten times farther away , and individual stars are rarely resolved from the ground .",
    "images are almost always highly crowded , and individual sources are almost always highly blended .",
    "this is the `` pixel lensing '' regime ( crotts 1992 ; baillon et al .",
    "image subtraction , necessitated by the high degree of crowding , has been very successful . while this technique allows the detection of variable objects of any kind , and is photon noise limited , the unlensed fluxes of lensed sources are unknown .",
    "thus m31 microlensing surveys must make do with a full width at half maximum timescale and a flux increase at maximum as the useful fit parameters . the unlensed flux measured by classical microlensing surveys is unavailable under most circumstances .",
    "sources are taken to reside in a luminous two - component model of m31 consisting of a double exponential disk and a bulge .",
    "the disk model is inclined at an angle of 77@xmath0 and has a scale radius of 5.98 kpc , a scale height of 400 pc , a central surface brightness of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and we ignore spiral arm effects ( walterbos & kennicutt 1988 ; gould 1994 ) .",
    "we take an @xmath3 band surface brightness profile from the @xmath4 color and the observation that @xmath5 ( bessel 1979 ) .",
    "the rotation velocity is taken to be 240 km s@xmath6 , with a linear rise from the center to 6 kpc .",
    "the bulge model is based on the `` small bulge '' of kent ( 1989 ) with a central surface brightness of @xmath7 , and @xmath8 ( walterbos & kennicutt 1988 ; bessel 1979 ) .",
    "this is an axisymmetric bulge with a roughly @xmath9 falloff in volume density with an effective radius of approximately 1 kpc and axis ratio , @xmath10 .",
    "values of the bulge density are normalized to make @xmath11 .",
    "the velocity distribution of bulge stars is taken to be maxwellian ( @xmath12 ) , with .",
    "these quantities are fairly well known , and unlikely to change the results by a large amount if revised .",
    "we explore a parameterized set of m31 halo models .",
    "each model halo is an axisymmetric cored `` isothermal sphere '' determined by two parameters : the axis ratio or flattening @xmath13 ( where @xmath14 indicates no flattening ) and the core radius @xmath15 . as we are concerned with lensing objects",
    "we also define the macho fraction ( @xmath16 ) as the fraction of the halo mass that consists of lensing objects .",
    "together , the mass density of halo lensing objects is then @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 km s@xmath6 is taken from observations of the m31 disk .",
    "the velocity distribution of the halo is taken to be maxwellian , with a circular velocity equal to @xmath20 , making @xmath21 km s@xmath6 .",
    "we compute rate distributions with respect to two different timescales .",
    "the first is the more familiar einstein time @xmath22 , defined as the time to cross the full einstein disk which has radius @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the fractional distance to the lens in relation to the distance to the source , @xmath25 .",
    "the einstein time is then given in terms of the lens velocity perpendicular to the line of sight , @xmath26 the second timescale we use is the full  width at half maximum of the lightcurve @xmath27 , much more easily measured when the source fields are crowded , as is the case for m31 .",
    "this timescale is simply related to the einstein time and to the minimum impact parameter @xmath28 of the lens relative to the line of sight ( taken in units of @xmath29 ) .",
    "this timescale is given by ( gondolo 1999 ) @xmath30 with the following definitions @xmath31 the function @xmath32 for all values of @xmath28 , with the limiting behavior @xmath33 thus , @xmath34 , and is more degenerate than @xmath35 due to the dependence on impact parameter .",
    "a further complication is that @xmath27 is essentially the measured timescale .",
    "determining the einstein time requires knowledge of the magnification , which can be very difficult in highly crowded fields as the source stars are highly blended .",
    "the einstein time might be inferred with extra effort , either by high resolution imaging of the source star or statistically with the @xmath36 technique ( baltz & silk 2000 ) .",
    "it is crucial to evaluate if these are necessary .",
    "using the model of  [ model ] , we compute the rate of detectable microlensing events . two computer codes written entirely independently and described elsewhere ( baltz & silk 2000 ; gyuk & crotts 2000 ) have been used , and produce nearly identical results .",
    "a numerical integration of the rate is performed , over the positions and velocities of the source ( with fixed brightness ) and lens ( with fixed mass ) along a given line of sight .",
    "the probability that an event with given parameters is detected is folded into the the integral .",
    "mass functions for the lenses and luminosity functions for the sources are applied at the end .    with lines of sight spaced at one arcminute intervals ,",
    "we construct contour maps of the event rate for `` self lensing '' by stars ( assuming no binary lenses , at most a 15% contribution ( mao & paczyski 1991 ; baltz & gondolo 2001 ) ) as well as for halo lensing .",
    "the self lensing contribution has four logical contributions , taking sources and lenses from the bulge and disk .",
    "the bulge - bulge contribution dominates the self lensing near the center of the bulge , along the minor axis the bulge - disk and disk - bulge contributions dominate , and far from the bulge the disk - disk contribution dominates ( though this is always dominated by the halo contribution for @xmath37 ) .",
    "these four in sum give a self lensing rate that is nearly symmetric about both the major and minor axes of m31 .",
    "the halo lensing contributions arise from both the m31 and milky way halos , lensing both disk and bulge stars .",
    "the milky way contribution has a nearly uniform optical depth .",
    "the m31 contribution is strongly asymmetric , with a significantly larger rate from the far edge of the minor axis .",
    "we have assumed the following definition for a detectable microlensing event .",
    "the mega survey most frequently employs the mdm 2.4 m telescope , thus we use its capabilities in the following .",
    "we assume that integrations totaling three hours are taken twice weekly during the m31 observing season : this is fairly conservative .",
    "we define an event as a deviation that has two consecutive samples four standard deviations above the baseline .",
    "we assume one arcsecond seeing , which is typical : the median mdm seeing is 0.95 arcsecond . to approximate the sensitivity of mdm , we assume that a star of @xmath38 magnitude @xmath39 or @xmath3 magnitude @xmath40 gives one photoelectron per second , and furthermore that the noise in the images is twice the photon counting noise ( this is quite conservative ) .",
    "we take the distance modulus to m31 as @xmath41 , a distance of 795 kpc .",
    "we assume a sky brightness of @xmath42 and @xmath43 mag arcsec@xmath44 . here",
    "we reiterate the fact that the source stars are not resolved , but instead are typically _ highly _ blended . only with difference imaging",
    "can the microlens variability be detected .",
    "the only measured `` baseline flux '' is the light falling within a resolution element due to several stars in the highly crowded fields .",
    "the luminosity function of m31 sources must be specified . for the disk , we take @xmath38 and @xmath3 band luminosity functions from mamon & soneira ( 1982 ) . for the bulge",
    ", we take the @xmath3 band from terndrup , frogel & whitford ( 1990 ) .",
    "data for the @xmath38 band is scarce , so we average ( in @xmath45 ) @xmath46 and @xmath3 band data for @xmath47 ( using terndrup et al .",
    "( 1990 ) for @xmath3 and holtzman et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for @xmath46 ) .",
    "for @xmath48 we attach a power law slope of 0.59 taken from the macho project data ( alves 2001 ) .    the mass function of lenses , both stellar and the macho component , is somewhat problematic .",
    "for the stellar component , we use the exponential chabrier ( 2001 ) mass function , down to @xmath49 .",
    "this is steeply decreasing , so there is little mass in the lowest decade ( the brown dwarfs ) .",
    "varying the stellar mass function in acceptable ranges has little effect unless for example there is a large component of brown dwarfs ( baltz & silk 2001 ) . the mean stellar mass of about @xmath50 is what dominates the rate and timescale from self lensing . we have also investigated a scalo ( 1986 ) mass function , which has a slightly higher mean mass , thus longer timescales and lower rates .",
    "the differences are not very large however . for lack of convincing evidence to the contrary",
    ", we take a fixed mass for machos .",
    "based on alcock et al .",
    "( 2000 ) we assume a mass of @xmath51 dex relative to solar @xmath52 , and we test values of @xmath53 and @xmath54 as well .",
    "we note here that macho mass can have a large effect on the expected timescales and rates .",
    "larger masses would indicate a lower rate and longer events , while smaller masses give a higher rate but shorter events .",
    "this is discussed further in the next section .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : map1]-[fig : map_mass ] we plot event rate contours for @xmath38 band observations .",
    "the contours for @xmath3 band are very similar .",
    "the only pronounced difference is in the bulge , where the @xmath3 band luminosity function is quite shallow , there is a significantly larger rate in the most central 4 square arcminutes . while it is desirable to detect events in two bands to test that the flux _ enhancement",
    "_ has a constant color ( in time ) , as should be the case for gravitational lensing , we will not include this criterion .",
    "the separate event rates are very similar , thus we deem it unlikely that the joint event rate will be much different . in fig .",
    "[ fig : map1 ] we plot the rate contours for self lensing and for m31 halos with a 20% macho fraction c.f.alcock et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ( @xmath55 ) and a core radius of 2 kpc .",
    "both round ( @xmath14 ) and flattened ( @xmath56 ) halos are illustrated .",
    "these maps are given as contours of constant rate , in units of events yr@xmath6 arcmin@xmath44 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : map2 ] we plot rate contours again for @xmath55 , but compare the small ( @xmath57 kpc ) and large ( @xmath58 kpc ) core cases , for both round and flattened halos . in fig .",
    "[ fig : map3 ] we illustrate the event rate from milky way machos , assuming both round and flattened cases again .",
    "the rate should be related to the surface brightness , also illustrated .",
    "in fact a naive calculation indicates that the rate from a constant optical depth of lenses ( such as a milky way population , which would nt vary much over the m31 fields ) should be proportional to the square root of the surface brightness .",
    "this can be seen from the following simple argument .",
    "the number of monitored sources is proportional to the surface brightness ( the proportionality constant depends on luminosity function ) , but the noise level increases as the square root of the surface brightness , necessitating an increase in magnification by the same factor to obtain an equivalent signal to noise .",
    "since the peak magnification of the event is proportional to the inverse of the impact parameter , the total cross section goes down by this square root of surface brightness .",
    "thus , the number of monitored sources times the cross section is proportional to the square root of the surface brightness .",
    "this argument breaks down at very high surface brightness where the magnification required implies events whose full width at half maximum timescales are too short to detect , however , this regime is not reached for m31 for the masses assumed . from fig .",
    "[ fig : map3 ] we see that this calculation is reasonable , as the shape of rate contours matches the shape of the surface brightness contours , and the rate of decline is roughly half on the logarithmic scale illustrated .",
    "the flattening of the milky way halo only changes the normalization of the rates , not the shape of the contours .    combining all of these components ,",
    "we illustrate the total expected event rate . in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : map_dist ] , we plot contours of the total microlensing rate , from self lensing and 20% macho halos for both the milky way and m31 . the self lensing dominates in the inner 5 kpc , but outside , the 20% halo provides most of the events .",
    "changing the halo fraction @xmath16 has little effect on the shape of the contours , and only in the region where the self lensing and halo lensing are comparable ( roughly speaking within the 0.3 events arcmin@xmath44 yr@xmath6 contour assuming a 20% halo ) .",
    "the overall normalization of the event rate away from the bulge can give a clear measurement of @xmath16 .",
    "for example , comparing a 20% halo to the case of a 5% halo , the inner contours ( within 1 event arcmin@xmath44 yr@xmath6 ) are not much affected since self lensing dominates and the _ shape _ of the outer contours is very similar since it is the halo that dominates there in both cases . between the 1.0 and 0.3 contours the event rate drops more quickly in the 5% halo case since this is the region where the microlensing rate from the halo and stellar components are comparable .",
    "this is clear from inspecting the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : map1 ] ( the self lensing rate ) and comparing to the bottom panel ( the m31 halo lensing rate ) which is trivially rescaled according to macho fraction .    fig .",
    "[ fig : map_dist ] shows the difference in the rate contours for round @xmath14 and flattened @xmath56 halos .",
    "the two cases appear to be easily distinguishable , especially along the major axis . in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : map_sn ] , we again plot contours of the total microlensing rate , this time varying the halo core radius from @xmath59 kpc .",
    "the significant difference is on the far side , along the minor axis",
    ". a crude measurement of core radius may thus be possible .",
    "here we see the utility of using the raw event rates to determine parameters .",
    "we do not need to evaluate the optical depth to do so .",
    "since in the end we are interested in the halo parameters like macho fraction and flattening , the optical depth is secondary .",
    "the einstein time is the fundamental timescale parameterizing the variability due to lensing , but it is notoriously difficult to measure from a pixel microlensing event . the directly measured parameter is the full - width at half - maximum timescale",
    ". we will illustrate the rate distribution of events in both of these timescales in fig .",
    "[ fig : map_dist ] , and we will discuss the extraction of halo parameters using both .",
    "the calculation of the differential rate with respect to @xmath27 follows baltz & silk ( 2000 ) , based on griest ( 1991 ) who discusses the differential rate with respect to @xmath35 .",
    "we plot the differential rate with respect to the logarithm of the timescale , normalized by the differential rate at a fixed timescale @xmath60 , @xmath61 taking @xmath60 longer than the the peak timescale then illustrates the variation in how rapidly the differential event rate falls at long timescales . in the upper panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : map_dist ] we illustrate @xmath62 for both @xmath35 and @xmath27 . for lines of sight",
    "far from the bulge , the distribution in @xmath27 peaks at around 20 days , while the distribution of @xmath35 peaks at around 100 days . near the bulge , the peaks of both timescale distributions are shorter .",
    "away from the bulge , where macho events dominate , the peak timescale is a measurement of the macho mass , as @xmath63 .",
    "taking a single mass , the @xmath35 distributions are @xmath64 dex wide in @xmath35 , translating to @xmath65 dex wide in @xmath66",
    ". with 50 events , a @xmath67 measurement of the mass would be possible with known einstein times . with only @xmath27 ,",
    "the situation is considerably worse , as the distribution in @xmath27 for a fixed mass is @xmath65 dex wide in @xmath27 , thus @xmath68 dex wide in @xmath66 . with the same 50 events , a mass measurement at the level of @xmath69 can be made .",
    "we thus see the utility of determining the einstein times for the events .",
    "we expect macho events to have longer timescales than stellar events simply due to the geometry , i.e.  the source  lens distances can be much larger . to compare , the bulge is of order 1 kpc in size , while a cored halo does not drop appreciably in density for of order 10 kpc .",
    "halo lenses have a larger velocity dispersion than bulge lenses , but not by a large factor . in all",
    ", we might expect halo lens timescales to be a factor of 2.5 or so larger .",
    "this fact can be used to determine cuts in timescale , either @xmath35 or @xmath27 , that maximizes the possibility that macho events can be distinguished from stellar events .",
    "we want a cut that both excludes as many self lensing events as possible and includes as many macho events as possible .",
    "we thus wish to maximize the signal to noise , including both the poisson counting of events , and a systematic error due to the uncertainty in the self lensing model . for a given area , observation time and minimum timescale",
    ", we expect @xmath70 events from m31 machos , @xmath71 events from milky way machos , and finally @xmath72 events from stellar lenses , with an uncertainty of @xmath73 ( which we take to be @xmath74 ) .",
    "we minimize the quantity @xmath75 as a function of minimum timescale to determine what , if any , timescale cut to use .",
    "these results are plotted in the top panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : map_sn ] . for most of the field , we find that no timescale cut should be made . near the center of the bulge , within 6 arcmin on the minor axis and 12 arcmin on the major axis , the situation is different . if the einstein times are known , it is advantageous to cut all events with @xmath76 days",
    ". this allows the largest signal to noise for separating the halo component . without the cut , for a one year survey",
    "the separation can be done at the @xmath77 level over the interior region . with the cut ,",
    "the significance rises to 4@xmath78 .",
    "if only @xmath27 is known , a similar timescale cut does not help much .",
    "we comment here that if we were to take a more conservative value for the model uncertainty ( say @xmath79 ) , the results are only affected near the center of the bulge , but the desired cutoff in einstein time and the signal to noise for detecting a halo knowing the einstein times are hardly affected even there .",
    "we also note that the utility of timescale cuts may change if the macho mass were to be significantly different from typical stellar masses .",
    "as it is now , the macho project mass value and the typical stellar mass are quite similar .    over the full far  side mdm field , a microlensing halo for m31 can be detected at roughly @xmath80 significance with one full year of well  sampled data , or approximately three observing seasons .",
    "this assumes @xmath81 , but the significance is roughly linear with @xmath16 . for @xmath82 ,",
    "a microlensing halo can be detected at roughly @xmath83 significance , and with @xmath84 , the significance drops to about @xmath77 .",
    "thus , @xmath84 is about the limit of detectability for a microlensing halo with three seasons of observing .",
    "this 5% value is also a plausible lower limit to halo lensing , caused by a much greater number of stars in m31 s halo / spheroid than the galaxy s ( reitzel et al .",
    "1998 , scaled to produce a microlensing prediction using alcock et al .",
    "1997 , table 10 ) .",
    "finally , we discuss the effects of varying the macho mass on the total and differential rates .",
    "the stellar mass function will remain that of chabrier ( 2001 ) . in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : map_mass ] rate contours are plotted for fixed macho masses ( for both the m31 and milky way contributions ) of @xmath54 , @xmath51 dex solar , and @xmath53 . as expected ,",
    "the lower masses give larger rates .",
    "we have also given the machos a chabrier ( 2001 ) function , identical to the stars .",
    "the resulting rates are similar to the @xmath85 case ( as the chabrier mass function peaks there ) , thus we do not illustrate them . in the top panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : map_mass ] we show @xmath86 for lens masses of @xmath54 and @xmath85 .",
    "the shift in peak is clearly seen , as is the higher rate for smaller lenses .",
    "taking a chabrier ( 2001 ) mass function , the rate distribution is very similar to the fiducial case illustrated in fig  [ fig : map_dist ] .",
    "we have provided maps of the microlensing event rate towards m31 in a model including m31 disk and bulge sources , and lenses from the m31 disk and bulge , as well as lenses in the dark halos of m31 and the milky way .",
    "we have varied the parameters of the dark halo , namely the core radius and the flattening , and studied the effects on the rate contours .",
    "the core radius affects the rates most in the galaxy center but these changes are partially obscured by the high rate of self lensing events there .",
    "the flattening does have a significant effect , especially along the major axis .",
    "the normalization of the rate contours away from the bulge gives a measure of the halo macho fraction .",
    "the easily measured timescale parameter is the full width at half maximum , but the more physical timescale is the einstein time .",
    "knowing the einstein times allows a much more accurate measurement of the lens mass , thus it is worth the extra trouble to try to measure the einstein times of the detected events .",
    "we have shown that a microlensing halo in m31 should be clearly distinguishable from self lensing if an appreciable event rate away from the m31 bulge is measured .",
    "we have explored the use of cuts in event timescale to separate the self lensing component from the halo lensing component of the event rate , and found that this helps near the bulge , but not further away .",
    "we have quantified the level of halo that is detectable , and found that a marginal detection of a 5% microlensing halo would be possible in three seasons of ground  based observations .",
    "higher halo fractions can be detected more convincingly of course .",
