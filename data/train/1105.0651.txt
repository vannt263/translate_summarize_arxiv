    "<S> many models have been proposed with the aim to find answer to these puzzles , for example : the quintessence@xcite , coupled quintessence@xcite , @xmath0-essence@xcite,@xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> the avoidance of the initial singularity will be the central question that we will address in this paper , exploring the idea of the `` emerging universe '' , where the universe has a non singular origin , such that the einstein universe . </S>",
    "<S> although the original proposal for the emerging universe @xcite suffered an instability , several proposals to formulate a stable model have been given @xcite , in particular one is obtained by invoking jordan brans dicke models@xcite    in this paper we explore a model including gravity and a single scalar field @xmath1 in the framework of the so called two measures field theory ( tmt)@xcite-@xcite . in tmt , many cosmological issues can be addressed : zero vacuum energy is obtained without fine tuning , the fifth force problem is resolved and the einstein s gr is restored when the local fermion matter energy density ( i.e in the space - time regions occupied by matter ) is much larger than the vacuum energy density . in this paper , we will address the existence and stability of the emerging universe in tmt . in a previous work , </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in which a square curvature term was almost of the tmt structure ( except for a contribution that gave rise to a cosmological term ) , an emergent universe was described .    </S>",
    "<S> tmt is a generally coordinate invariant theory , where the action has to be of the form@xcite-@xcite @xmath2 including two lagrangians @xmath3 and @xmath4 and two measures of integration @xmath5 and @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> one is the usual measure of integration @xmath5 in the 4-dimensional space - time manifold equipped with the metric @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the other is the new measure of integration @xmath6 in the same 4-dimensional space - time manifold . </S>",

    "<S> in such a case , i.e. when the measure fields enter in the theory only via the measure @xmath6 , the action ( [ s ] ) possesses an infinite dimensional symmetry . in the case given by eq.([phi ] ) these symmetry transformations have the form @xmath11 , where @xmath12 are arbitrary functions of @xmath13 ( see details in ref.@xcite ) . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we will insist in keeping this symmetry and therefore the tmt structure .    </S>",
    "<S> we assume here that all fields , including also the metric , connection and the _ measure fields _ are independent dynamical variables . </S>",
    "<S> all the relations among them are results of the equations of motion . in particular , the independence of the metric and the connection means that we proceed in the first order formalism and the relation between connection and metric is not necessarily according to riemannian geometry .    </S>",
