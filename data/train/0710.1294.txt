    "in a series of recent papers @xcite , we have advocated that factorisation theorems @xcite for exclusive processes may be extended to the case of other reactions such as @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the kinematical regime where the virtual photon is highly virtual ( of the order of the energy squared of the reaction ) but the momentum transfer @xmath8 is small .",
    "this enlarges the successful description of deep - exclusive @xmath9 reactions in terms of distribution amplitudes @xcite and/or generalised distribution amplitudes @xcite on the one side and perturbatively calculable coefficient functions describing hard scattering at the partonic level on the other side .",
    "the reactions @xmath10 in the near forward region and for large virtual photon invariant mass @xmath11 , may be studied in detail at intense electron colliders such as those which are mostly used as @xmath5 factories .    with the kinematics described in fig .",
    "[ fig : ggstarab ] , we define the @xmath12 transition distribution amplitudes ( tdas ) @xmath13 as the fourier transform of matrix elements @xmath14 where @xmath15\\,\\gamma{\\psi}(\\frac{z}{2})$ ] with @xmath16 . the wilson line @xmath17 $ ] provides the qcd - gauge invariance for non - local operators and equals unity in a light - like ( axial ) gauge .",
    "we do not write the electromagnetic wilson line caused by the presence of the photon , since we choose an electromagnetic axial gauge for the photon .",
    "we then factorise the amplitude of the process @xmath18 as @xmath19 with a hard amplitude @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the hadron @xmath22 distribution amplitude ( da ) .",
    "the variable @xmath23 is as usual the light - cone momentum fraction carried by the quark entering the meson @xmath22 , @xmath24 ( resp .",
    "@xmath25 ) is the corresponding one for the quark leaving ( resp",
    ". entering ) the tda .",
    "the skewness variable @xmath26 describes the loss of light - cone momentum of the incident photon and is connected to the bjorken variable @xmath27 .",
    "contrarily to the case of generalised parton distributions ( gpd ) where the forward limit is related to the conventional parton distributions measured in the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , there is no such interesting constraints for the new tdas .",
    "the only constraints are sum rules obtained by taking the local limit of the corresponding operators and possibly soft limits when the momentum of the meson in the tda vanishes . lacking any non - perturbative calculations of matrix element defining tdas , we are forced to build toy models to get estimates for the cross sections , to be compared with future experimental data .    for definiteness ,",
    "let us consider the @xmath28 vector tdas which is given by ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) :    @xmath31\\gamma^\\mu{u}(\\frac{z}{2})| \\gamma \\rangle   \\nonumber\\\\ = & \\frac{1}{p^+ } \\frac{i\\;e}{f_\\pi}\\epsilon^{\\mu { \\varepsilon}p \\delta_{\\perp } }   v^{\\pi^-}(x,\\xi , t)\\ ; . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    a sum rule may be derived for this photon to meson tda . since the local matrix element appears in radiative weak decays , we can relate it to the form factor @xmath32 : @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "let us consider the @xmath35 production case when the @xmath36 flies in the direction of the virtual photon and the @xmath37 enters the tda .",
    "note that in the neutral @xmath38 case , the tda process is forbidden by @xmath39-conjugation .    for definiteness ,",
    "we choose , in the cms of the meson pair , @xmath40 and @xmath41 and we express the momenta trough a sudakov decomposition :    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     with @xmath42 .",
    "we can see that @xmath26 is determined by the external kinematics through @xmath43  similarly to @xmath44 to which it is linked via the simple relation @xmath45 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath46 for the reaction @xmath47 is proportional to @xmath48 ; it reads @xmath49 where the hard amplitude @xmath50 is ( @xmath51 ) : @xmath52    we choose @xmath53 as the asymptotic normalised meson distribution amplitude and @xmath54 gev . after separating the real and imaginary parts of the amplitude ,",
    "the @xmath55-integration gives : @xmath56    the scaling law for the amplitude is @xmath57 up to logarithmic corrections due to the anomalous dimension of the tda .",
    "to quantify the magnitudes of the cross section , we need to adopt a specific model for the non perturbative tda . as a first choice , we start from a double distribution for @xmath58  @xcite which leads to a @xmath55- and @xmath26-dependence of the tda in the form @xmath59 : @xmath60 with @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is analogous to the forward quark distribution in the gpd case and @xmath63 is a profile function parametrised as @xmath64^b}{(1-|\\beta|)^{2b+1 } } , \\nonumber\\ ] ] where the parameter @xmath65 characterises the strength of the @xmath66dependence . as a first guess , we assume that the @xmath67dependence of @xmath68 is given by a simple linear law @xmath69 and we assume a mild @xmath26 dependence as given by @xmath70 .",
    "moreover we implement the normalisation ( with @xmath71 ) and the @xmath72dependence of the tda through the vector form factor : @xmath73 the @xmath72dependence of this form factor has been studied in chiral perturbation theory and turned out to be weak , so we shall neglect it in this model and we shall use the measured values at @xmath8=0 .     vector transition distribution amplitude @xmath74 in model 1 and in model 2 ( for @xmath75 gev@xmath76).,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]   vector transition distribution amplitude @xmath74 in model 1 and in model 2 ( for @xmath75 gev@xmath76).,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    as a second model",
    ", we use the initial @xmath8-dependent double distribution of tiburzi  @xcite .",
    "explicitly , @xmath74 is written as @xmath77 where @xmath78 is set to @xmath79 gev  @xcite .",
    "the sum rule is satisfied for @xmath75 gev@xmath76",
    ". we shall keep @xmath8 fixed in the following to enable comparison with model 1 . in the following",
    ", we shall refer to this approach as model 2 .",
    "we see that these two models give quite different results and we shall use both in section 3 to estimate the sensitivity of the cross sections to tda models .",
    "other models for tdas have recently been worked out @xcite and models for pion gpds  @xcite could also be applied to the tda case .",
    "since we want to focus on the study of the tda behaviour , we decide to choose @xmath80 , @xmath8 , @xmath26 and @xmath81 as our kinematical variables .",
    "the differential cross section reads @xmath82    in fig.[fig : rho_cross_section_xi_q2 ] ( a ) , we plot the cross section ( after a trivial @xmath81 integration ) vs @xmath26 and in fig.[fig : rho_cross_section_xi_q2 ] ( b ) vs @xmath80 for both models of the vector tda .",
    "the behaviour for intermediate values of @xmath26 is sensitive to specific models for the tda . as shown in [ fig : rho_cross_section_xi_q2 ] ( b ) , the @xmath80-behaviour is model independent and thus constitutes a crucial test of the validity of our approach .",
    "both real and imaginary part of the amplitude contribute significantly to the cross section , which is reasonable at these moderate energies .",
    "since the phenomenological analysis of the pion form factor indicates that a rather large value of @xmath83 should be used together with the asymptotic da , we use @xmath84 in our numerical study .",
    "our conclusions would not be strongly affected by a different choice .",
    "it is now time to test experimentally the new factorised qcd approach to forward hard exclusive scattering in @xmath2 exclusive reactions .",
    "we believe that our models for the photon to meson transition distribution amplitudes are sufficiently constrained to give reasonable orders of magnitude for the estimated cross sections .",
    "cross sections are large enough for quantitative studies to be performed . after verifying the scaling of the cross sections ,",
    "one should be able to measure these new hadronic matrix elements , and thus open a new gate to the understanding of the hadronic structure .",
