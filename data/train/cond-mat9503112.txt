    "@xcite such a pairing would result in presence of `` nodal '' points in the superconducting excitations spectrum in whose vicinities it has gapless phonon - like character .",
    "it should essentially modify the damping behavior comparing to the @xmath2-wave pairing state .",
    "the quasiparticle damping owing to impurities has been extensively studied in literature .",
    "@xcite however , this is not the only channel , though , maybe , the more interesting one .",
    "the excitations scattering by phonons and also by each others always contribute to the damping , as well .    in the present paper",
    "we evaluate the quasiparticle damping in two - dimensional ( 2d ) superconductors with @xmath1-wave - like pairing appeared due to their four - fermionic interaction",
    ". it may be the on - site coulomb repulsion in the small-@xmath3 hubbard model , or the residual part of the interaction which provides the pairing in the strong correlations scheme .",
    "@xcite    in the bcs case , the damping at zero temperature has the threshold at @xmath4 .",
    "we show that for the gap function with nodes it demonstrates gapless @xmath0 low - frequency behavior at the nodal points .",
    "the results obtained for high frequencies depend on details of fermi surface ( fs ) parametrization .",
    "the damping for the circular fs will increase quadratically while for the spectrum with van - hove singularities the additional linear regime appears .",
    "being generalized onto finite temperatures , this results allow us to conclude about existence of crossovers in temperature dependence of damping in the superconducting state .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sect .",
    "ii we obtain general expression for damping of superconducting excitations due to their interaction . in sect .",
    "iii we evaluate it for the case of 2d superconductor with nodes in the spectrum .",
    "since the high - frequency behavior of damping depends strongly on fs parametrization , in the consequent subsections we analyze three principal cases : ( i ) the case of circular fs and also the case of fs of varying curvature when the gap node intersects it ( ii ) at the almost flat piece or ( iii ) in the vicinity of saddle - point of the spectrum . at last , in sect .",
    "iv we generalize and discuss the results obtained .",

    "in this section we will evaluate eq .",
    "( 5 ) in the case of 2d superconductor with unconventional pairing assuming different model parametrizations for the fermi surface .",
    "we shall suppose that the gap function has nodal lines @xmath31 in the 2d brillouin zone .",
    "let these lines intersect fermi surface at a set of the points @xmath32 .",
    "then in the vicinities of such points one can write @xmath33 where @xmath34 and the index @xmath35 labels the nodal point .",
    "we see that the excitation spectrum near these points has gapless linear character .",
    "in general , the quasiparticle damping due to their interaction has to reveal threshold feature in frequency in the superconducting state .",
    "the threshold corresponds to the minimal energy of the excitation needed to decay into three quasiparticles in the intermediate state . for the gap function with nodes",
    "however it disappears at the nodal points of the spectrum .",
    "consequently , the damping at this points appear to be gapless . taking it into account",
    ", we restrict ourselves in treatment of damping in the vicinities of nodal points only .    the straightforward calculations at @xmath36 yield @xmath37 where the indices @xmath38 run over all the nodal points .",
    "here @xmath39 are some dimensionless positive factors .",
    "the diagonal terms of the matrix @xmath40 ( i.e. , referring to a single nodal point ) are always numbers of order of unity while the off - diagonal ones could have additional smallness for particular fs parametrizations via their dependence on spectrum parameters .",
    "the principal contribution to the damping at low frequencies comes from excitations with momenta lying in the small elliptic vicinities of nodal points ( see fig . [ 1 ] ) wherein linear approximation for the spectrum works well .",
    "note that we obtain the universal cubic frequency dependence of the excitations damping at the nodal points without appealing to any fixed parametrization for spectrum . by the way , such dependence means the stability of nodes with respect to this kind of interaction .    at the same time , some features of the model may , in principle , lead to different power laws . in particular , the damping would increase with frequency slower than @xmath41 if at least one of spectrum zeroes ( i ) appeared due to tangency of fs and gf node , or ( ii ) coincided with van - hove singularity in the band structure and/or ( iii ) with cusp- or discontinuity - point of the nodal line of the gap function .",
    "all these cases are obviously quite exotic .    when the frequency increases , the integration in eq .",
    "( 5 ) can not be restricted to the nodal vicinities and such characteristics as general shape of fs , curvature of fs at the nodal points , existence of van - hove singularities in the spectrum , @xmath42 should be taken into account .",
    "one can distinguish three qualitatively different cases : ( i ) the circular fs and also the fs of varying curvature with the nodal points located ( ii ) far from or ( iii ) at the sharp curvature maximum .",
    "we shall illustrate the above cases by examples which would allow us to examine in detail the intermediate asymptotics and to express the corresponding crossover scales through the parameters of the models used .      putting the lattice parameter to be unity , we write the circular fs as follows : @xmath43 . for definiteness",

    "@xcite in line with eq .",
    "( 8) we get : @xmath46 where @xmath47 . the principal contribution to @xmath48",
    "is obtained when all the momenta @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are almost parallel and belong to the vicinities of the nodal points ( see fig .",
    "[ 1 ] ) .    at higher frequencies @xmath52",
    "we find @xmath53\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to obtain eq .",
    "( 10 ) , the curvature of fs was taken into account ( see appendix ) .",
    "the crossover from the cubic dependence to the quadratic one appears at @xmath54 .",
    "it can be qualitatively explained on the following way .",
    "one can show that , when @xmath55 , the areas of integration defined by arguments of @xmath56-functions in eq .",
    "( 5 ) are located near the nodal points ( see fig . [ 1 ] ) where the spectrum can be well approximated by ellipses . when @xmath57 , the areas of integration propagate along the whole fermi surface so that not only the vicinities of the nodal points principally contribute to @xmath58",
    ". for @xmath59 , we obtain the quadratic intermediate asymptotic regime with unconventional logarithmic factor of the form @xmath60 which stems from integration over the fs . at frequencies",
    "higher then the gap value @xmath61 information about the superconducting state disappears , and the conventional 2d fermi - liquid result @xcite is restored .",
    "note that principal contributions to @xmath62 in the latter case again come from almost parallel @xmath63 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "now we will demonstrate how the deformation of fs affects the damping . as before we shall consider @xmath65 gap function .",
    "let us adopt the simplest tight - banding form for the normal - state dispersion : @xmath66+\\mu$ ] . here",
    "@xmath67 is the nearest - neighbors hopping integral and @xmath68 is the chemical potential measured from the half - filling .",
    "note that for small enough @xmath69 fermi surface has long almost flat pieces near the points of intersection with the nodal lines of the @xmath65 gap function ( see fig .",
    "[ 2]a ) .    under the above conditions one can easily rewrite the low - frequency asymptotics of damping by substituting @xmath70 in the parenthesis and @xmath71 in other parts of eq .",
    "the range of validity for such expression is restricted by the condition @xmath72 .",
    "next , in order to obtain expression for damping at @xmath73 , the same substitutions in eq .",
    "( 10 ) should be done .",
    "obviously , all the statements concerning the areas of principle contributions still hold .",
    "finally , at @xmath74 we obtain @xmath75    thus , the additional linear - in-@xmath76 high - frequency regime appears in this case .",
    "it occurs since at @xmath77 the areas of integration in eq .",
    "( 5 ) engage the saddle - points of the normal - state spectrum located at @xmath78 and @xmath79 . for the normal state crossover to the linear behavior",
    "has been demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "it follows from the aforementioned that there is no room for linear regime of damping at @xmath80 while the crossover from the cubic dependence to the quadratic one occurs at @xmath81 .",
    "this case can be treated as the one of slightly deformed circular fs without additional characteristic scales .",
    "when @xmath68 decreases ( i.e. , close to the half - filling ) the long almost flat pieces of the fs appear as well as the saddle - points in the normal - state spectrum come into play . for @xmath82 there",
    "co - exist three ranges with cubic , quadratic and linear frequency dependencies matching at @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively . at last , for very small @xmath85 linear approximation for spectrum works well unless the ellipses touch the saddle - points .",
    "consequently , the range of quadratic dependence in the latter case disappears and there exist the only crossover scale @xmath86 .      finally , let us consider the situation when the nodal points lie at the points of maximum of fs curvature . to illustrate this case we write the normal - state spectrum in the tight - binding form and choose the gap function as @xmath1-wave with @xmath88-symmetry , @xcite @xmath89 ( see fig . [ 2]b ) .",
    "then the straightforward calculations at @xmath90 yield the formulas similar to those obtained in previous subsection : @xmath91 when @xmath92 we have @xmath93.\\ ] ] again , we obtain the crossover from the cubic regime to the quadratic one .",
    "we see that close to the half - filling ( at @xmath94 ) the energy scale of this crossover ( @xmath95 ) is much less than that previously considered .",
    "it is connected with large curvature of fs near the nodal points so that the linear approximation for the spectrum breaks down much earlier .",
    "note that this narrowing of the @xmath0 region is accompanied by the strong parametric enhancement of im@xmath22 by factor @xmath96 .    at higher frequencies @xmath97 we get @xmath98 \\label{14}\\ ] ] comparing this formula with formula found in previous subsection we see that the additional logarithmic factor exists stemming from closeness of saddle - point to the nodal one .",
    "note also that under @xmath99 we deal with poor - defined excitations since as it follows from our calculations @xmath100 for all @xmath76 in this case . from eq .",
    "( 14 ) and kramers - kronig relations one can find that the quasiparticles are well - defined if @xmath101 ^ 2 \\leq 1\\ ] ] which is nothing but the criterion of absence of spin density wave .",
    "we note here that the same criterion arises in the case considered in subsect .",
    "b , as well .",
    "the additional logarithmic enhancement stems in that case from the self - energy behavior near the `` corners '' of fs ( cf .",
    "all the results presented in previous section may be rewritten in an universal form . to do that more compactly",
    "let us introduce the following variables @xmath102 and @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the curvature of fs at the nodal point .",
    "we define also @xmath105 as the angle between @xmath106 and @xmath107",
    ". then we may write down the following formula :    @xmath108 , & \\min \\ , ( a , b ) \\ll \\omega\\ll \\max \\left(b,{\\displaystyle\\frac{b^2}{a } } \\right ) ; \\\\",
    "\\omega b^2\\times\\left ( 1\\ \\mbox{or } \\",
    "\\ln { \\displaystyle \\frac{a\\omega}{b^2 } } \\right)\\ , , & { \\displaystyle\\frac{b^2}{a}\\ll\\omega } , \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] this result is valid until @xmath109 and @xmath110 , as it takes place in all principal cases .",
    "the additional extrafactor @xmath111 at high frequencies @xmath112 appears only when the nodal point lies near the saddle one .",
    "it is easy to see that all previous results are reproduced by the following substitutions ( i ) @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 ( assuming @xmath116 ) for circular fs , ( ii ) @xmath117 , @xmath114 , @xmath118 and ( iii ) @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 for fs of varying curvature .",
    "we mention also that the quadratic regime disappears completely when @xmath122 and that the intermediate crossover scales differ principally as @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "note that we have evaluated the damping using spectrum expansion near specific points up to the second order terms in deviations from this points .",
    "this is obviously valid for fermi surfaces smooth enough .",
    "we undertake our consideration for circular and simplest tight - binding fss .",
    "meanwhile , in the adequate theory of high - temperature superconductivity the next - nearest - neighbor hopping terms in the tight - binding scheme should be taken into account .",
    "@xcite it is clear from our analysis how the picture will be modified in this case .",
    "say , for @xmath44-wave pairing the range of cubic regime will be shrunken and a set of intermediate crossovers may appear in the range of the quadratic one .",
    "however , they will differ only by the logarithmic factor .",
    "next , for the special choice of the parameters @xmath125 and @xmath126 the saddle - points near @xmath127 and @xmath128 appear to be the `` extended '' ones ( quasi-1d ) .",
    "@xcite here @xmath129 is the next - to - nearest neighbor hopping integral and @xmath68 controls the filling .",
    "this case should be treated separately .",
    "the above consideration was made for zero temperature .",
    "it can be trivially generalized onto low finite temperatures ( less than @xmath76 and minimal frequency scale in ( 16 ) ) . in the opposite limiting case ( but not very close to @xmath130 ) eqs .",
    "8 - 14 can be rewritten by substitution @xmath131 for @xmath76 . in particular",
    ", it leads to the cubic @xmath131-dependence of damping for sufficiently small temperatures : @xmath132 ( the temperature dependence of the gap function yields only the corrections for this law ) . in order to apply our results to the normal state one should put simply @xmath133 . note",
    "that divergence in the low - temperature asymptotics never exist , since always @xmath134 .",
    "if the crossover scales @xmath135 or @xmath136 are found below @xmath130 , @xmath137 or @xmath131 regimes should appear in the superconducting phase .",
    "when @xmath138 , the crossover from the conventional 2d fl behavior to the linear one occurs in the normal state .",
    "our treatment has demonstrated , in particular , that the `` purely nodal '' regime for damping takes place in the quite narrow frequency ( temperature ) range .",
    "it is restricted from above by the much less scale than the gap value as one could expect .",
    "it seems to be not a feature of damping only , so that the same characteristic scale should appear for other quantities such as density of states , nuclear relaxation rate , penetration depth , inelastic scattered neutron intensity near incommensurate and internodal vectors , @xmath139 .",
    "since , on the other hand , the impurities scattering restricts this range from below , one can estimate it as follows : @xmath140 ^ 2,\\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\varepsilon_{n}&=&\\left(\\frac{q_{f}^{2}}{2m}\\right)_{{\\bf   q}={\\bf q_{n } } } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath141 is the damping due to impurities .",
    "the estimates show that the range defined by eq .",
    "( 17 ) appear to be quite narrow for the high-@xmath142 compounds .",
    "it may even disappear if @xmath141 will be large enough ( @xmath14310@xmath144 ) .    in conclusion , we consider the damping of excitations in the 2d superconductor with nodal points in the spectrum .",
    "we show that at @xmath27 this damping demonstrates gapless cubic - in-@xmath76 low - frequency behavior at the nodal points .",
    "the results obtained for high frequencies depend on details of fermi surface parametrization .",
    "we have analyzed two important particular fs parametrizations such as the models of almost free and tight - binding electrons .",
    "we find the frequency variation of damping and the crossover scales for these cases . for smooth enough",
    "fs they may be expressed through the model - free characteristics of the spectrum at the nodal points .",
    "we argue that the excitations are well - defined in the wide frequency range .",
    "we extend our treatment to finite temperatures and study the possibility of crossovers in temperature dependence of damping below the superconducting transition .        here",
    "we study eq .",
    "( 5 ) for circular fs : @xmath145 .",
    "we shall assume that @xmath146 is finite in the important areas of the integrand in eq .",
    "also , let us take for a moment the combination of @xmath147 coefficients in eq .",
    "( 5 ) to be of order of unity .",
    "then we should analyze the following expression @xmath148 where d is defined by the condition @xmath149 it is convenient to make the substitution @xmath150 , @xmath151 in eq .",
    "( a1 ) , then @xmath152 , @xmath153 , where @xmath154 and @xmath155 are the corresponding polar angles .",
    "taking @xmath156 , we may represent the normal - state dispersion as @xmath157 .",
    "besides , we expand the gap functions up to the linear in angle terms @xmath158 , @xmath159 . using such parametrization and leaving the principal terms only , we reduce eq .",
    "( a1 ) to the following one @xmath160 where the limits of integration stem from inequality ( a2 ) .",
    "this condition means , in particular , that at small @xmath76 momenta integrations in eq .",

    "it is convenient to pass therefore to the elliptic coordinates in eq .",

    "we can neglect the second term in @xmath56-function .",
