    "light can be slowed down by seven orders of magnitude using the electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite .",
    "the eit makes a resonant , opaque medium transparent by means of quantum interference between the optical transitions induced by the control and probe laser fields . as a result",
    ", a weak probe pulse travels slowly and almost without a dissipation in a resonant medium controlled by another laser @xcite .",
    "electromagnetically induced transparency was shown not only to slow down dramatically laser pulses @xcite but also to store them @xcite in atomic gases . following the proposal of ref .",
    "@xcite , storage and release of a probe pulse has been demonstrated @xcite by dynamically changing the intensity of the control laser .",
    "the possibility to coherently control the propagation of quantum light pulses opens up interesting applications such as generation of nonclassical states in atomic ensembles and reversible quantum memories for light waves @xcite .",
    "associated with eit is a dramatic modification of the reflective properties of the medium . in this paper",
    "we analyse the manifestation of the orbital angular momentum ( oam ) of light in such a highly dispersive medium . during the last decade optical oam",
    "has received a great deal of interest @xcite .",
    "however most studies on the topic deal with ordinary ( not slow ) light . here",
    "we consider the propagation of a slow light with an oam in a moving atomic medium , the emphasis being placed on a rotating medium , such as a vortex lattice in an atomic bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) . unlike the previous studies on the slow light in moving media @xcite , we allow the light to carry an oam along the propagation direction . we show that the oam of slow light manifests itself in a rotation of the polarisation plane of a linearly polarised light . to extract a pure rotational phase shift",
    ", we suggest to measure a difference in the angles of the rotation of the polarisation plane for two light beams characterised by opposite oam .",
    "the differential angle @xmath3 is proportional to the rotation frequency of the medium @xmath1 , as well as to the oam of light .",
    "the effect can be used as a tool for measuring the rotation frequency @xmath1 of the medium and/or the oam of slow light .",
    "we should note that rotational phase shifts have been shown to lead to rotation of an image by propagation through a rotating medium ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this suggests that such effects might also be observable in the configuration discussed here .",

    "consider an ensemble of @xmath4-type atoms characterized by two hyper - fine ground levels @xmath5 and @xmath6 , as well as an electronic excited level @xmath7 ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the translational motion of atoms is described by the three component or vector operator for the translational motion , @xmath8 , in which the three components , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , correspond to the three internal atomic states . the quantum nature of the atoms comprising the medium",
    "will , of course , determine whether these field operators obey bose - einstein or fermi - dirac commutation relations .",
    "the atoms interact with two light fields : a strong classical control laser induces a transition @xmath12 and a weaker quantum probe field , which drives a transition @xmath13 , see fig .  1 .",
    "the electric field of the probe beam is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the central frequency for probe photons , @xmath16 is the wave - vector and @xmath17 is the unit polarization vector .",
    "this field may be considered as either a classical amplitude or a quantum operator .",
    "we have chosen the dimensions of the electric field amplitude @xmath18 so that its squared modulus represents the number density of probe photons .",
    "the probe field @xmath19 obeys the following wave - equation @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the polarisation field of atoms , @xmath22 being the dipole moment for the atomic transition @xmath13 .",
    "let us introduce the slowly varying matter field - operators : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the energy of the atomic ground state @xmath5 and @xmath25 is the frequency of the control field .",
    "the probe field is quasi - monochromatic , so that its amplitude @xmath26 varies very slowly in time during an optical cycle . in this case",
    "the following equation holds for the slowly - varying amplitude of the probe field : @xmath27 where the parameter @xmath28 characterizes the strength of coupling of the probe field with the atoms .",
    "note that , unlike in the usual treatment of slow light @xcite , we have retained the second - order derivative @xmath29 in the equation of motion ( [ eq : e - equation ] ) .",
    "this allows us to account for the fast changes of @xmath18 in a direction perpendicular to the wave - vector @xmath30 , i.e. in the @xmath31-plane .",
    "therefore , our analysis can be applied to the twisted beams of light @xmath32 carrying an oam of @xmath33 per photon .      in the following",
    "we shall adapt a semiclassical picture in which both electromagnetic and matter field operators are replaced by c - numbers .",
    "the equations for the matter fields are then : @xmath34 with @xmath35 here @xmath36 is the atomic mass , @xmath37 is the trapping potential for an atom in the electronic state @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) , @xmath40 is the rabi - frequency of the control laser driving the transition @xmath12 ; @xmath41 and @xmath42 are , respectively , the frequencies of electronic detuning from the two- and one - photon resonances . in the limit of infinite mass we can ignore the spatial derivatives in these equations which then reduce to the familiar equations for the probability amplitudes describing the coherent excitation of three - level atoms in the @xmath4 configuration @xcite . for us , however , retention of this center of mass motion is essential in order to describe light dragging effects .",
    "note also that the equation of motion ( [ eq : phi1 ] ) for @xmath43 does not explicitly accommodate collisions between the ground - state atoms . in the case of a bec where the state @xmath5 is mostly populated",
    ", the collisional effects can be included replacing @xmath44 by @xmath45 in eq .",

    "( [ eq : phi1])-([eq : phi2 ] ) the coupling with the probe and control fields has been written using the rotating wave approximation .",
    "therefore the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi1 ] ) has a positive frequency part of the probe field ( i.e. @xmath48 ) , whereas the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi3 ] ) has a negative frequency part ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "for the same reason , eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi3 ] ) contains a factor @xmath40 , whereas eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi2 ] ) contains a factor @xmath49 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : phi2 ] ) relates @xmath50 to @xmath51 as : @xmath52 initially the atoms are in the ground level @xmath5 and the rabi frequency of the probe field is considered to be much smaller than @xmath40 .",
    "consequently one can neglect the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi1 ] ) that causes depletion of the ground level @xmath5 , giving @xmath53 . in the case of a bec",
    "the wave - function @xmath54 represents an incident variable determining the atomic density @xmath55 and velocity field @xmath56 .",

    "the adiabatic approximation is obtained neglecting the excited state population in eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi3 ] ) to yield : @xmath57 equations ( [ eq : e - equation ] ) , ( [ eq : phi3-phi2 ] ) and ( [ eq : phi2-adiabat ] ) provide a closed set of the equations for the electric field amplitude @xmath18 : @xmath58 this equation suffices to describe a wide variety of phenomena . in particular",
    "it can be used to model light storage by introducing time - dependence in @xmath59 @xcite and light dragging due to spatial variation of @xmath40 and/or @xmath43 . here",
    "we shall be especially interested in image rotation associated with spatial variations of @xmath43 , corresponding to a moving medium and with light beams carrying orbital angular momentum so that @xmath60 .",
    "suppose the probe and control beams co - propagate : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the wave - number of the control beam . for paraxial beams the amplitudes @xmath63 and @xmath64 depend only weakly on the propagation direction @xmath65 .",
    "furthermore the amplitude of the control field @xmath64 is considered to change weakly in the transverse direction as well . neglecting the spatial dependence of @xmath64 , the equation ( [ eq : e-2 ] ) for the probe field takes the form @xmath66\\tilde{\\mathcal{e}}=0\\ , , \\label{eq : e-3}\\ ] ] where we have replaced @xmath29 by its transverse part @xmath67 because of the paraxial approximation . here",
    "@xmath68 is the radiative group velocity , @xmath69 is a complex atomic velocity field , and @xmath70 is the two - photon frequency mismatch .",
    "as the beams co - propagate , the ordinary two - photon doppler shift @xmath71 and two photon recoil @xmath72 are of little importance and hence have been omitted .",
    "furthermore , the radiative velocity @xmath73 is much larger than the velocity of the atomic recoil @xmath74 , so the latter @xmath75 has been neglected in the equation of motion ( [ eq : e-3 ] ) .    the term with the spatial derivative @xmath76 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : e-3 ] ) describes the radiative propagation along the @xmath65-axis with the group velocity @xmath73 . on the other hand ,",
    "the term containing @xmath77 represents the dragging of light by a moving medium .",
    "the amount of such a dragging is determined by the difference in the group velocity and the speed of light .",
    "for fast light there is no dragging , but for slow light a substantial dragging is possible .",
    "consider a probe beam carrying an orbital angular moment ( oam ) @xmath33 per photon along the propagation axis @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the azimuthal angle .",
    "suppose the medium is rotating as a rigid body with a frequency @xmath1 in the @xmath31 plane .",
    "for instance , an atomic vortex lattice exhibits such rigid body rotation on a coarse grained scale @xcite . in such a situation",
    "the linear velocity is @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the unit vector along the azimuthal direction and @xmath82 is the cylindrical radius . under these conditions the dragging term featured in the equation of motion ( [ eq : e-3 ] ) takes the form @xmath83 suppose the atomic density ( and hence the group velocity ) is approximately constant in the transverse direction @xcite , so that the group velocity depends on the propagation coordinate only : @xmath84 . using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : e-3 ] ) and ( [ eq : v - a - rotating ] ) , the total phase shift then acquired by the beam propagating along the @xmath65-axis is @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the entrance point into the medium .",
    "the first term in @xmath87 represents the rotational frequency shift due to the orbital angular momenta @xmath33 of the probe photons .",
    "if the control and probe fields are circularly polarised , the second term accommodates the rotational two - photon frequency shift @xmath88 , as well as the residual detuning @xmath89 @xmath90 where the sign of @xmath88 depends on the polarisations of the control and probe field .",
    "the factor @xmath6 appears because the control and probe beams are considered to have opposite circular polarisations leading a double frequency shift . in the slow - light experiments involving a @xmath4 scheme",
    "@xcite it is quite common for the control and probe fields to have the opposite circular polarisations which drive the atomic transitions with @xmath91 .",
    "the residual detuning @xmath89 depends neither on the orbital angular momentum of a photon nor on its polarisation and is hence of little importance for the subsequent discussion .",
    "a characteristic feature of an eit medium is that only one circularly polarised component of light ( say left polarised light ) is slowed down .",
    "the right circularly polarised light has a forbidden resonant transition to the excited state and is propagating with a group velocity close to the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "if the medium rotates and the probe beam carries an oam , the left circularly polarised beam of light acquires a large rotational frequency shift because of its small group velocity . on the other hand , the right polarised light is a fast light and hence experiences almost no rotational frequency shift . if the incoming light beam is linearly polarised , this leads to the rotation of the polarisation plane by an angle @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the dynamical phase shift acquired by the fast ( right polarised ) light , @xmath94 being the phase shift acquired by the slow ( left polarised ) light given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta - theta ] ) . to extract a pure rotational phase shift , we suggest measuring the difference in the angles of the polarisation plane rotation for two consecutive probe beams characterised by opposite oam @xmath95 where we have taken advantage of the fact that @xmath93 and @xmath96 do not depend on the winding number @xmath2 .",
    "the angle @xmath97 is proportional to the rotation frequency of the medium @xmath1 and to the winding number @xmath2 .",
    "therefore the effect is due to the orbital angular momentum of slow light .",
    "furthermore , the angle @xmath3 is inversely proportional to the group velocity of light .",
    "this suggests that for slow light the angle @xmath97 should be large enough to be detectable .",
    "let us make some numerical estimates for typical bec / slow light experimental parameters . in the experiment by hau _",
    "et al _ @xcite the radiative group velocity is @xmath98 , whereas the length of a cigar shaped bec is @xmath99 .",
    "typically the transverse frequency of an elongated trap is @xmath100 , so the rotation frequency @xmath1 should be of the same order .",
    "thus the difference in the angle of the polarisation plane rotation is @xmath101 .",
    "this is a small angle , yet by no means beyond current experimental expertise @xcite .",
    "for fast light the corresponding angle @xmath3 should be far too small to be observed .",
    "in the present paper we have considered the propagation of a slow light with an orbital angular momentum in a moving atomic medium .",
