    "the observation of long - lasting oscillations in peak amplitudes of two - dimensional ( 2d ) echo spectroscopy as function of increasing delay time between pump and probe pulses @xcite has lead to an intensive search for quantum mechanical effects in photosynthetic systems at physiological temperatures .",
    "the general theoretical model of excitonic energy transfer from the antenna to the reaction center is well established @xcite . for the fenna - matthews - olson ( fmo ) complex an efficient transfer relies on a dissipative coupling of electronic and vibronic degrees of freedom @xcite , which puts the excited system in an energy funnel towards the reaction center .",
    "the oscillations recorded in 2d echo spectra were not anticipated within a simplified rate equation formalism based on markovian approximations for the dissipative coupling of vibronic and electronic degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the physical origin of the experimental observations has lead to various theoretical proposals , which are roughly divided into two mechanisms .",

    "[ fig : fmospectraldensity ] ) puts the vibronic contributions on a much smaller scale compared to electronic coherences , which lead to oscillation periods determined by the differences in excitonic eigenenergies .",
    "the second proposed mechanism @xcite identifies two prerequisites for long - lasting electronic coherences and oscillations of cross - peaks of 2d - spectra in the continuous part of the vibronic mode distribution : ( i ) a small initial slope of the vibronic density towards zero frequency , and ( ii ) a larger coupling between a continuum of vibrations whose frequencies are in the range of the typical excitonic energy gaps .",
    "both conditions are fullfilled by the florescence line - narrowing spectral density @xmath1 .",
    "it remains an open question to what extend 2d spectra are probing vibrational or electronic properties of light - harvesting complexes .",
    "moreover , for the design of artificial nanostructure it is of interest to identify the physical mechanism for efficient transport and conditions for the accompanying vibronic density . here , we disentangle the interplay of electronic and vibronic effects on the transport by introducing a reliable method to dissect the 2d - echo signal .",
    "we show that a time - windowed short - time fourier transform ( stft ) is a suitable tool to track and assign specific vibronic and electronic contributions at all delay times .",
    "we find that two - dimensional echo - spectra can significantly _ underestimate _ the duration of electronic coherences due to the destructive superposition of several pathways related to additional excitations and ground - state bleaching .",
    "such pathways are not important for excitonic energy transfer , which for the same system displays longer electronic coherences than the 2d spectra .",
