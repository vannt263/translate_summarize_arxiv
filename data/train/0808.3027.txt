    "since shor s quantum algorithm for factoring large integers more efficiently than classical algorithms appeared @xcite , many researchers have been devoting themselves to realization of quantum computation in their laboratories . to implement a quantum computer , we have to prepare quantum bits ( qubits ) , which are two - state quantum systems , and quantum logic gates , which apply unitary transformations to qubits . in general",
    ", we can apply an arbitrary unitary transformation to a single qubit at ease no matter which physical system we choose as the qubit .",
    "however , almost all the researchers think implementation of a two - qubit gate to be very difficult because it has to generate nonlocal quantum correlation ( entanglement ) between two local qubits .",
    "furthermore , it is shown that we can construct any unitary transformation applied to qubits from the one - qubit transformations and a certain two - qubit gate , such as the conditional sign - flip gate @xcite . from these reasons ,",
    "many physicists aim for realizing the two - qubit gate .    here",
    "we show how to construct the conditional sign - flip gate with jaynes - cummings model ( jcm ) , which is a quantum mechanical model describing the interaction between a single two - level atom and a single electromagnetic field mode .",
    "we also give discussions about experimental setups for realizing our scheme .",
    "properties of the jcm have been studied theoretically from 1960s @xcite and they were confirmed by experiments in 1980s @xcite , so that the jcm is very familiar and well - studied to the researchers in the field of atomic and optical physics .",

    "moreover , we can expect that our proposal becomes one of the important candidates for the method of implementing quantum logic , for example , cold trapped ions interacting with laser beams @xcite , polarized photons in the cavity quantum electrodynamics system @xcite , and so on .    to construct a quantum computer",
