    "the probability density function ( pdf ) of the mass density in non - self - gravitating isothermal supersonic turbulence is believed to be lognormal @xcite .",

    "* ) , the origin of the power - law tail in self - gravitating supersonic turbulence still awaits a credible explanation .",
    "a related question pertains to the power index value for the tail .",
    "@xcite find a slope of @xmath2 in non - magnetic kpc - scale interstellar turbulence simulations , while @xcite measured @xmath3 in isothermal adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) mhd simulations of supersonic molecular cloud turbulence in a 10  pc box .",
    "is there a universal power index value that applies to self - gravitating isothermal turbulence ? what determines the slope ? to address these questions , we analyze a deep amr simulation with a linear dynamic range of @xmath4 that follows the star formation process from turbulent initial conditions on a scale of a few pc down to a few au .",
    "we describe the simulation detail in the following section , while section  3 presents the analysis of the density distribution and provides testable predictions for the power index values .",
    "section  4 discusses the limitations of the model and effects of the magnetic field on the density pdf",
    ". the final section outlines conclusions .",
    "our star formation simulation was performed with the enzo code for cosmology and astrophysics @xcite and discussed earlier in @xcite .",
    "we solve the hydrodynamic equations , including self - gravity and a large - scale random force to drive the turbulence .",
    "we also adopt an isothermal equation of state and periodic boundary conditions . in this simulation ,",
    "amr is automatically carried out in collapsing regions in order to properly resolve the jeans length @xcite .",
    "we use root grid of @xmath5 cells and five amr levels with a refinement factor of four .",
    "the computational box has a size @xmath6  pc , and the gravitational collapse of dense protostellar cores is resolved down to the scale of 2  au .",
    "the temperature is uniform , @xmath7  k , and the sound speed is constant , @xmath8  km  s@xmath9 .",
    "the mean density @xmath10  @xmath11 and the rms flow velocity of @xmath12 km  s@xmath9 , typical of molecular clouds on scales of @xmath13  pc , correspond to sonic mach number @xmath14 .",
    "the free - fall time @xmath15 the dynamical time @xmath16 and the virial parameter for this model @xmath17 correspond to a @xmath18  @xmath19 molecular cloud prone to collapse on its free - fall timescale .",
    "indeed , the dendrogram analysis applied to a snapshot from a larger @xmath20 simulation @xcite resembling the initial conditions adopted here , indicated the presence of gravitationally bound objects on essentially all scales within the computational domain @xcite .",
    "we began the simulation as a uniform grid turbulence model by stirring the gas in the computational domain for @xmath21 with a large - scale random force that includes 40% dilatational and 60% solenoidal power and then , at @xmath22 , turned the forcing off to continue the simulation with amr and self - gravity for about @xmath23 .",
    "figure  [ long ] shows the density distributions in this simulation .",
    "the red line corresponds to the initial condition at @xmath22 , when we turn on self - gravity .",
    "the density pdf at this time can be perfectly represented by a lognormal distribution @xcite .",
    "once gravity starts to operate , a power - law tail develops at the high end of the distribution .",
    "after @xmath24 , when the creation of first - level amr subgrids is triggered by the first collapsing objects , the density distribution no longer remains lognormal . as",
    "the collapse of these first objects proceeds , followed by further grid refinement , an extended power - law tail emerges with a slope of about @xmath25 .",
    "the tail departs from the initial lognormal distribution already at @xmath26 and continues straight for nearly 10  dex in probability and more than 6  dex in density .",
    "as the simulation progresses , the slope continues to evolve slowly toward shallower values .",
    "the power index at the end of the simulation is @xmath27 .",
    "an even shallower tail at very high densities , @xmath28 , develops as an indication of mass pile - up due to an additional support against gravity that comes from the conservation of angular momentum .",
    "the power index for this centrifugally supported part of the density distribution is very close to @xmath29 .",
    "the fact that the power law breaks at a density slightly in excess of @xmath30 may indicate the minimum grid resolution requirement for convergence in star formation simulations with sink particles ( roughly @xmath31 for this set of parameters ) , but the main focus of this letter is on the origin of the extended power law at densities below @xmath30 .",
    "why does it cover over six orders of magnitude in mass density without a tiny bit of slope change ?",
    "what fundamental physics is involved ?",
    "let us first recall that supersonic turbulence is a multi - scale phenomenon shaping the structure of the mass distribution in molecular clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at mach numbers , @xmath32 , the turbulence creates a `` fractal '' density distribution with the mass dimension of @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "since this mass dimension is larger than the critical value for gravitational instability , @xmath34 , these highly inhomogeneous systems are still subject to gravitational collapse @xcite .",
    "the extent of the power law we obtain in the deep amr simulation hints at the tail origin in the hierarchical nature of gravitational collapse of dense structures in molecular clouds .",
    "let us take a look at the very bottom of the hierarchy , where amr resolves collapsed protostellar cores .",
    "we used density fields for approximately cubic subvolumes centered on several selected dense cores to obtain the pdfs in the immediate vicinity of these objects .",
    "the linear size of these subvolumes is of order @xmath35  pc .",
    "figure  [ extract ] offers three example pdfs and volumetric rendering of the corresponding cores .",
    "stretches of the power - law distributions are clearly present in all three cases , although the slopes vary from as shallow as @xmath36 to as steep as @xmath37 . , while the third case shows only a hint of the pile - up at @xmath28 .",
    "the first two cores have already developed relatively thin centrifugally supported disks , as can be seen in the renderings that show both face - on and edge - on views of the disks .",
    "the third core displays a rather modest flattening in the edge - on projection , indicating a weak rotation .",
    "] when the contributions from individual cores combine to form the density pdf for the whole computational domain , by some magic the resulting slope appears to be the same as that from the collapsing larger - scale structures characterized by a lower density , @xmath38 $ ] .",
    "the easiest way to solve this puzzle is to assume that a self - similar collapse solution would act as a strong attractor determining the form of the density pdf in hierarchical , turbulent , self - gravitating molecular clouds .",
    "there is a large inventory of ( semi-)analytical solutions for the collapse of spherically symmetric isothermal configurations to choose from .",
    "@xcite arranged these similarity solutions into a banded two - dimensional continuum embracing the limiting cases of _ fast _ ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter lp ) and _ slow _ @xcite collapse and their generalization by @xcite .",
    "while this family of solutions describes gravitational condensation starting from a diverse set of idealized initial conditions , they have two important features in common .",
    "first , during the early stages of the evolution preceding the formation of a singularity at the center , all of them develop a @xmath39 density profile .",
    "configuration from the outset . ]",
    "second , at late stages an expansion wave ( ew ) forms and propagates from the central singularity through the accreting material leaving behind a self - similar distribution with @xmath40 at @xmath41 .",
    "it can be readily shown that the mass density pdf for a spherically symmetric configuration with a @xmath42 density profile is a power law @xmath43\\propto d\\left(\\rho^m\\right ) \\label{32}\\ ] ] with an index @xmath44 .",
    "thus , formally , the similarity solutions generate power - law pdfs with a slope @xmath45 corresponding to the @xmath46 profile during the early collapse stages and with a combination of slopes @xmath45 ( @xmath46 profile at lower densities ) and @xmath47 ( @xmath48 profile at higher densities ) after the singularity has formed at the center .",
    "if the spherical symmetry is broken , for instance due to the presence of rotation , the situation becomes substantially more involved and hardly tractable analytically .",
    "@xcite suggest that a weak inward propagating compression wave that triggers the formation of the singularity would converge incoherently on the center and interfere with any reflected ew .",
    "the interference would then cause a significant degradation in the density profile at small radii .",
    "we believe this lowers expectations for the pure ew solution in realistic situations .",
    "however , the @xmath46 density profile and the corresponding slope of the density pdf @xmath45 could potentially be preserved if an equilibrium singular disk with a flat rotation curve would form at the center @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the disks formed in our simulation ( figure  [ extract ] ) typically show steeper density profiles ( @xmath49 ) and rotation curves that peak at @xmath50  au and then monotonically decline with radius up to @xmath51  au .",
    "higher resolution would be required to follow the formation and structure of these disks with amr properly .",
    "the pdf slope @xmath52 at the end of the simulation continues to evolve slowly toward shallower values , but may still remain steeper than @xmath2 corresponding to the @xmath46 density profile .",
    "neither does it approach @xmath53 of the ew solution .",
    "interestingly , a similar slope of @xmath54 was independently obtained by @xcite in a driven super - alfvnic amr mhd turbulence simulation with @xmath55 .",
    "this might indicate that some physics is missing in our discussion above .",
    "indeed , both simulations model self - gravitating supersonic turbulent flows capable of creating the initial conditions for very dynamic collapses involving masses much in excess of the bonnor  ebert critical mass @xcite .",
    "such situations will be better approximated by pressure - free ( pf ) collapse solutions @xcite .",
    "the final stages of self - similar spherically symmetric pf collapse prior to the formation of central singularity are characterized by the @xmath56 density profile @xcite which corresponds to the pdf power - law tail with @xmath57 .",
    "the free - fall collapse approximation , however , always breaks down near the center where the effects of pressure inevitably become important , so the slope of the high end of the pdf should still converge to @xmath45 .",
    "we indeed observe a slope change from @xmath25 to @xmath2 at @xmath58 , see figure  [ long ] .",
    "since the ratio of gravitational - to - pressure forces in the isothermal pf collapse @xmath59 @xcite , it scales with the mass density as @xmath60 .",
    "this weak dependence of @xmath61 on the density is consistent with the appearance of break in slope at very high densities .    the projected density of an infinite sphere with the @xmath62 density distribution",
    ", @xmath63 also has a power - law pdf , @xmath64 but with a slope @xmath65 . for the lp , pf , and ew similarity solutions , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "figure  [ project ] shows the projected mass density pdfs from the amr simulation at @xmath22 ( red line ) and @xmath69 ( blue line ) .",
    "the blue line is based on a subset of the amr data up to 8  au in resolution ; only the first four levels of fine mesh were used to make the plot . similar to the three - dimensional density pdf , the initial distribution is well represented by a lognormal .",
    "the evolved self - gravitating configuration shows a clear power - law tail at high column densities with a slope of @xmath70",
    ". the actual slope uncertainty may be larger than the formally determined value of @xmath71 .",
    "the distributions in figure  [ project ] show the average pdfs for all three projections , while only one projection would be available in real observations .",
    "the root grid - based high - density tails for individual projections show some bumps ( very similar to those seen in figure  4 of @xcite and some straight sections with slopes broadly varying from as flat as @xmath53 to steeper than @xmath72 .",
    "overall , power index @xmath73 measured in the simulation is right in between the predicted slopes for the pf and lp solutions , but the ew option ( @xmath74 ) seems to be rejected .",
    "we expect shallower slopes in simulations with lower mach numbers or in longer turbulence decay simulations without continuous resupply of kinetic energy from random forcing .",
    "finally , a hint of a shallower slope at @xmath75 may indicate the effect of centrifugal support , similar to the slope flattening in figure  [ long ] .",
    "we do not expect significant differences between driven and decaying turbulence models within the fraction of the first free - fall time in this amr run ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "by the end of the simulation , the system would still retain @xmath76% of the kinetic energy delivered by the stirring force , if self - gravity were not included .",
    "however , self - gravity slightly increases the kinetic energy of a turbulent system ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thus the lack of forcing does not really make a big difference .",
    "since the free - fall time is shorter than the dynamical time that determines the energy decay timescale , the density pdf established by @xmath69 can be only weakly sensitive to the lack of forcing .",
    "since the virial parameter for this model is rather small , the role of self - gravity can be somewhat exaggerated . in situations with @xmath77",
    "one should expect a weaker effect . with @xmath78 close to unity , assuming the same mach number and domain size , the power - law tail will be shallower ( more closely resembling the lp case ) in a more extended density range and will depart from the initial lognormal distribution at densities somewhat higher than @xmath79 . while our adopted low value of the virial parameter",
    "creates a distribution similar to that of the taurus molecular cloud , a higher @xmath78 value would perhaps produce a distribution more similar to that of the lupus  i cloud ( see figure  2 in * ? ? ?",
    "overall , it seems that cloud - to - cloud variations in the virial parameter @xmath78 and in the age of the cloud in combination with projection effects can account for the full diversity of high - density tails in the observed star - forming clouds ( figure  4 of * ? ? ?",
    "in this discussion on the density pdf , we so far ignored the effects of magnetic fields that are important for star formation .",
    "our recent isothermal and multiphase mhd turbulence calculations , however , both show that variations in the level of magnetization of interstellar clouds make little or no difference for the high - density end of the density pdf ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in the absence of self - gravity , the high end of the distribution preserves its lognormal shape . in super - alfvnic turbulence",
    ", the magnetic field strength also shows a weak correlation with the gas density of the form @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "the most recent zeeman splitting data for molecular cores also indicate a slope of @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "a similar relation can be inferred theoretically for dynamically collapsing magnetized protostellar cores ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "assuming that the correlation @xmath82 exists , we predict a similar power - law tail in the pdf of the magnetic field strength with a slope from @xmath83 to @xmath84 for the range of @xmath85 $ ] and @xmath86 $ ] .",
    "a power index of @xmath87 measured by @xcite is consistent with @xmath88 at @xmath89 and with their pdf slope @xmath90 .",
    "we found an intriguing agreement between the probability distribution of molecular cloud densities in recent observations @xcite and in a deep amr simulation of self - gravitating , supersonically turbulent molecular cloud @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "star - forming clouds display strong deviations from lognormal density distribution in the form of power - law tails at high density .",
    "in contrast , clouds with no active star formation display purely lognormal distributions of density .",
    "we attribute the origin of the tails to the fundamental self - similar properties of the @xmath46 isothermal collapse and @xmath91 pressure - free collapse laws , which control the density profiles of collapsing structures .",
    "this allows us to predict the power - law indices for the mass density ( @xmath86 $ ] ) and for the projected density ( @xmath92 $ ] ) depending on the physical conditions in the parent molecular cloud ( @xmath93 , @xmath78 , etc . )",
    "that broadly agree with both observations and simulation results .",
    "our results may suggest a reconciliation of various attempts to build a phenomenological theory of star formation and will contribute to the interpretation of numerical simulations in terms of the proposed phenomenologies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
