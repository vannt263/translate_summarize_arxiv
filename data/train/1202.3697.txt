    "the main goal of the lhc physics program is to unravel the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking , with the leading explanation being the standard model higgs boson . in considering the sm higgs hypothesis , or more generally the correct description of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) as realized in nature , it is important to synthesize the experimental results which are determined to date , in terms of symmetries that must be ( at least approximately ) respected in a successful effective description of physics at the weak scale .",
    "probes of the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking can be summarized in terms of tests of the properties of the @xmath5 , @xmath6 bosons through electroweak precision data observables ( ewpd ) , probes of the low energy flavour changing signatures of weak scale physics , and direct searches .",
    "the results of the first two of these probes indicate that a viable theory of ewsb can reduce parameter tuning by adopting an approximate @xmath7 custodial symmetry to comply with ewpd @xcite , and imposing approximate minimal flavour violation ( mfv ) @xcite , in order to be robustly consistent with the results of the flavour physics program .",
    "the sm higgs sector with renormalizable couplings to the fermions is exactly consistent with mfv by definition , but it is only approximately @xmath7 symmetric",
    ".    recently , atlas and cms have reported significant exclusion limits for a standard model higgs boson over a broad range of masses .",
    "the current exclusion regions reported by atlas @xcite are @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 at @xmath11 confidence level ( cl ) . while the higgs mass region excluded by cms @xcite at this cl",
    "is @xmath12 .",
    "there is also a suggestive combination of experimental hints in multiple final state signatures pointing in both experiments to a higgs mass @xmath13 .",
    "although certainly not conclusive , the evidence for a light resonance with this mass scale and approximately sm higgs - like properties has also been augmented by the observation of 7 events ( compared to an expected background of 2 events ) within one @xmath14 of 124 gev in the @xmath15 channel at cms @xcite , which would correspond to a sm higgs boson produced through vector boson fusion . we will use these experimental results in this paper to determine to what degree current data is selecting a sm higgs boson or not .",
    "these experimental hints , along with the lack of any clear evidence of new states discovered to date at the lhc are suggestive that an effective theory of the ewsb sector , including a light scalar resonance and the approximate symmetries of @xmath7 as well as mfv , is currently an appropriate description of the data .",
    "we will examine recent results from the lhc in this framework and ascertain up to what degree experiment is selecting a sm higgs doublet at present .",
    "we perform a broad analysis of this question in sections  ii and  iii in terms of two parameters characterizing the deviation from the sm value in the gauge and fermion couplings of a higgs boson .",
    "we find two nearly degenerate minima in the global fit .",
    "the effective lagrangian we employ emerges naturally in composite higgs scenarios .",
    "we comment on their interpretation in terms of current data .",
    "the lhc results should be interpreted in the context of the indirect evidence for the sm higgs and its properties in ewpd .",
    "we examine the consistency of the results of our global fit to lhc higgs - like data and ewpd in section iv .    finally ,",
    "in section v , we discuss how future measurements can be presented in a manner that can more precisely and efficiently refine the understanding of such an effective theory with the aim of clarifying if the correct description of ewsb is the sm higgs mechanism or not .",
    "in particular we point out the utility of ratios of best fit signal strengths which can be provided by the experimental collaborations and which have the ability to resolve the degeneracy in the two best fit regions we find when examining lhc higgs - like data .",
    "this is due to the fact that , although an individual experimental signal can be faked by a higgs - like degree of freedom , it is difficult for such a degree of freedom to simultaneously reproduce the higgs predictions in other channels with different dependencies on effective couplings .",
    "we consider an effective lagrangian with a light scalar resonance , denoted as @xmath16 in the following , that includes the goldstone bosons associated with the breaking of @xmath17 and the sm field content . a minimal description of these degrees of freedom",
    "is given by an effective chiral lagrangian with a nonlinear realization of the @xmath18 symmetry .",
    "the goldstone bosons eaten by the @xmath19 bosons are denoted by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 , and are grouped as ( x ) = e^i _ a ^a / v , with @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath23 field transforms linearly under @xmath24 as @xmath25 where @xmath26 indicate the transformation on the left and right under @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively , while @xmath7 is the diagonal subgroup of @xmath24 , under which the scalar resonance @xmath16 transforms as a singlet .",
    "a derivative expansion of such a theory is given by @xcite & = & ( _ h)^2 - v(h ) + ( d_^ d^ ) , + & & - ( |u_l^i |d_l^i ) (    c y_ij^u u_r^j + y_ij^d d_r^j    ) + h.c . , + v(h ) & = & m_h^2 h^2 + ( ) h^3 + ( ) h^4 + .",
    "[ eq : efflag ] here we have adopted for later convenience the notation of composite models @xcite .",
    "minimal flavour violation dictates that the sole source of flavour violation are the yukawa couplings and that @xmath16 is a singlet in flavour space and that its couplings to fermions ( @xmath29 ) are flavour - universal .",
    "( note that mfv is also compatible with @xmath30 proportional to a combination of the sm yukawa matricies . )",
    "we adopt this assumption , although we note that the lhc data is essentially only sensitive to flavour violation linked to the large top coupling ( scaled by @xmath31 from its sm value ) at present .    the @xmath17 subgroup of @xmath24 is weakly gauged in such theories .",
    "we will fit the current data including the leading linear higgs - like coupling effects in the lagrangian of eq .",
    "( [ eq : efflag ] ) .",
    "we will neglect , however , dimension five operators @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and other higher dimension operators in the fit , focusing on the effect of @xmath35 and @xmath31 .",
    "this can be justified by uv model building , for example in the composite higgs case . in general , the coefficients @xmath36 are arbitrary numerical parameters subject to experimental constraints .",
    "model building in the uv of this effective theory fixes relations between the parameters .",
    "the completion of the theory with a sm higgs boson fixes @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and higher order terms in the polynomial expansion of the @xmath16 field vanish . in this case",
    "@xmath16 becomes part of a linear multiplet u = ( 1 + ) , reducing the theory to the sm higgs boson lagrangian where the growth in @xmath39 of the high energy scattering cross section @xmath40 is exactly cancelled .",
    "for other choices of these parameters the growth in @xmath39 of high energy scattering processes is only moderated .",
    "first we will explore to what degree a light scalar resonance leading to the current experimental excesses reported by cms and atlas is consistent with a sm higgs boson interpretation or not .",
    "note that the fermiophobic higgs hypothesis is frequently interpreted to correspond to the singular point where @xmath41 , while a more general interpretation of this hypothesis is @xmath42 with @xmath35 unfixed , but constrained by current data .",
    "the experimental hints for the higgs boson that have been reported to date in each channel individually provide only marginal evidence .",
    "the best fit values to the signal strengths @xmath43 for particular higgs masses are summarized in table i.    in table i we also give in the second column the expected mass sensitivity of the various experimental signatures as well as in the third column the best fit value for @xmath44 together with the @xmath45 experimental error and the @xmath11 confidence level limit . if the mass resolution is not explicitly quoted , as in the @xmath46 and the @xmath47 results given by atlas , we display as an estimate the mass sensitivity for these channels as quoted by cms .",
    "since the mass sensitivity is such that the best fit masses can reasonably be interpreted to overlap , we do not introduce a correction factor in the fit to shift to a common mass value .",
    "we also display , in column two , the local significance when given by the experiments . in column four",
    "we schematically list the leading sensitivity of the signal in terms of the cross section rescaling and the effective branching ratios to final states @xmath48 given by @xmath49 $ ] .",
    "the actual production cross section rescalings are combinations including subdominant channels , that can introduce further dependence on ( a , c ) , see section  iii.a .",
    "we do not include a look elsewhere effect as we are performing a global fit for a particular mass value @xmath50 gev .",
    "the cms photon measurements are split up in accordance with ref .",
    "the @xmath51 events are classified by the conversion of the photon in the crystal - defining a parameter @xmath52 - and their location in the detector , being endcap - e or barrel - b. the data we fit to also have associated exclusion curves .",
    "we take these exclusions into account by another procedure described in the text .",
    "note that the @xmath53 searches at atlas are included in the exclusion analysis but not fit to in the signal strength best fit as the corresponding experimental error is not available .",
    "the excesses of events with @xmath54 the same mass scale in various channels are suggestive of a resonance , that could be interpreted as evidence of a light higgs boson .",
    "we will assume that these excesses of events correspond to the same underlying physics and fit the data to discern the degree up to which the excesses are consistent with a sm higgs boson interpretation .",
    "our procedure to perform a global fit to the current data is as follows .",
    "we also show joint fits for the higgs mass values @xmath56 where we have taken the experimentally reported @xmath57 and the corresponding theory predictions at a common @xmath58 due to the release of the required data by cms , after version one of this paper .",
    "the data we use is given in table iii for each particular higgs mass value chosen .",
    "these results are shown for various masses in fig .",
    "8 . examining the results",
    ", one clearly sees that the excess at @xmath59 can be distinguished globally to be a likely statistical fluctuation compared to the global fit to the excess of events around @xmath60 . for the three mass values , the best fit points @xmath61 are @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , where for the latter two masses we use the cms di - photon data resolved into subclasses .",
    "fitting to @xmath65 with global di - photon best fit data only , compared to di - photon data split into subclasses , shows that the discrimination on the parameter space offered by separately reporting the vbf induced @xmath66 signal is important .",
    "we also encourage the experimental collaborations to report the degree of contamination of this signal with @xmath67 initial state higgs events to enable a consistent treatment of the reported best fit signal stengths .",
    "one can demonstrate how the vbf signal interpolates between the two results shown in fig .  8 by adding in contamination due to @xmath68 events with our consistent rescaling procedure . one finds the series of plots shown in fig .  9 for various degrees of contamination .",
    "note that cms also reports @xmath69 events which offer a similar discrimination of the parameter space as the @xmath66 signal in principle .",
    "however , again contamination due to @xmath68 events will exist and is not reported by the collaborations .",
    "we do not use this data as a separate channel at present .",
    "the update to the data has a small effect on the @xmath70 of the sm higgs hypothesis compared to the best fit value of the current data . assuming no contamination due to gg for vbf events one finds that our previously reported global fit with the moriond 2012 data update ( but without correcting to a single higgs mass value in the experimental best fit signal strengths ) has the sm hypothesis residing on a @xmath71 curve around the best fit value of @xmath72 . assuming a @xmath73 contamination of the vbf events due to gg , the sm hypothesis remains consistent with the data at @xmath74 compared to the best fit value . for a direct comparison ,",
    "the fermiophobic scenario with @xmath75 is consistent with the data at @xmath76 for the same global fit .",
    "when a @xmath77 contamination due to gg events for the vbf diphoton signal of cms is assumed , the same fermiophobic scenario is consistent with the data at the @xmath78 .",
    "we do not consider a fermiophobic scenario to be favoured by the global data or the pattern of deviations from the sm in the current data set .",
    "with such marginal signal events , statistical fluctuations in the data are still present affecting the pattern of deviations .",
    "finally , the 95% cl exclusion curves from atlas and cms in the plots of this appendix have been determined using a more precise method than eq .",
    "( [ applim ] ) . in the same spirit of ref .",
    "@xcite , for each individual search channel @xmath79 , we have first approximated the corresponding probability density function of the signal strength parameter @xmath44 by a gaussian @xmath80 $ ] .",
    "we have obtained the quantities @xmath81 and @xmath82 trying to get the best approximation to the reported 95% cl in that channel , @xmath83 ( obtained from the equation @xmath84 ) . in the case of cms channels",
    ", we use the approximation of ref .",
    "@xcite ( which uses @xmath85 and obtains @xmath86 by solving the equation that determines @xmath83 ) . in the case of atlas data ,",
    "we find better agreement with the reported limits by directly using @xmath87 and @xmath82 as provided channel , where we find a discrepancy between the limit derived from @xmath88 and @xmath82 and the reported limit .",
    "we therefore do not use this channel to extract the combined limit in the @xmath72 plane .",
    "although this is a subdominant channel , the impact of such discrepancy on the sm exclusion around @xmath89 gev is not negligible . in the case of the @xmath90 channel , for some ranges of higgs masses",
    "the reported ( negative ) value of @xmath91 is hitting a boundary and we could not use it to reproduce well the experimental limit . in these cases",
    "we use the same approximation as for the cms channels . ] . to illustrate the precision of our approximations to the exclusion limits we compare them with the official 95% cl limit on @xmath92 in fig .",
    "[ fig : limitscomp ] . in the left ( right )",
    "panel we show the cms ( atlas ) limit , with the official curve in black .",
    "the red curve is the simple approximation of eq .",
    "( @xmath93 ) and the green curves are more precise determinations of the limit as explained above .",
    "the dashed green line corresponds to an approximate determination of @xmath94 and @xmath82 as in ref .",
