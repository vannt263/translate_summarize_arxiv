    "nature which is composed of dead and living things is a system far out of equilibrium .",
    "this can be evidenced by measuring nature s evolution with the appropriate scales of space and time .",
    "in particular , the dynamics of the living things is basically governed by the theory of natural selection first proposed by charles darwin @xcite .",
    "this theory is certainly one of greatest scientific achievements of the nineteenth century . very briefly",
    ", this theory simply says that evolution occurs not by breeding species best adapted to their environment but by driven to extinction those less or poorly adapted .",
    "this mechanism leads to the emergence of highly specialized structures .",
    "if we also consider the astonishing variability of the species , we then can say that nature is a complex system .",
    "indeed , for all we know , nature operates _ at _ the self - organized critical state @xcite .",
    "one of the most fundamental characteristics of a system with self - organized criticality ( soc ) is to exhibit a stationary state with a long - range power law decay of the spatial and temporal correlations @xcite .",
    "power law is a very abundant behavior found either in natural phenomena such as the light emitted from quasars , the earthquake s intensity , the water level of the nile or as a direct result of human activities like the distribution of cities by size , the repetition of words in the bible and in traffic jams .",
    "self - organized critical systems evolve to the complex critical state without the interference of any external agent . differently from what happens in the usual critical phase transition , in soc",
    "there is not a tuning parameter .",
    "the prototypical example of soc is a pile of sand @xcite .",
    "another common property of soc is that the self - organization state only takes place after a very long transient period .",
    "last but not least , a minor change in the system can cause colossal instabilities called avalanches .",
    "intermittent bursts of activity separating long periods of quiescence is called punctuated equilibrium .",
    "gould has conjectured that the biological evolution itself shows , in fact , this kind of equilibrium @xcite .    now ,",
    "if nature can really be found in a critical self - organized state , is this state optimal or extremal in some sense ? .",
    "through the systematic rejection of the worst , the darwinian evolutionary theory is a born optimization structure . by adding interactions and competition between the species we will witness the emergence of co - evolution .",
    "one model specially tailored to represent the co - evolutionary activities of the species is the bak - sneppen model @xcite . in this model ,",
    "each species is located on the sites of a lattice and has associated a fitness value between 0 and 1 ( randomly drawn from an uniform distribution ) . at each time step , the species with the smallest associated value as well as its nearest neighbors are selected to replace their fitness with new random numbers . in one dimension , after a long transient time , almost all species have fitness larger than the critical value 0.67 @xcite .",
    "recently , inspired by natural processes , some heuristic optimization techniques have been proposed : genetic algorithms @xcite , simulated annealing @xcite and extremal optimization @xcite .",
    "the extremal optimization ( eo ) method seems to be the most efficient of them since it brings the system faster and closer to its ground - state @xcite . in a few words , this method consists of the following rules : i ) a discrete dynamical variable @xmath1 ( initially chosen at random ) is associated to each site @xmath2 of a lattice with @xmath3 points ; ii ) a fitness @xmath4 is attributed to that site using some given prescription ; iii ) all lattice sites are then increasingly ranked according to their fitness ( the site with the worst fitness is of rank 1 ) ; iv ) a site of rank @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) is selected with probability @xmath7 ( @xmath0 is an arbitrary real positive number ) and its dynamical variable @xmath1 is changed to @xmath8 ( @xmath9 , compulsorily ) ; v ) repeat at step iii ) as long as desired .    in this paper , a kind of bak - sneppen dynamics",
    "is applied to a spin system which possesses a complex ground state structure in one dimension . the _ discrete fitness variability _ is identified as being responsible for the _ absence _ of a critical self - organized state . by introducing a noise in the spin configuration space , we show that the system can now reach a critical self - organized state with power law correlations .",
    "this simple trick can easily be extended to other types of discrete systems .",
    "on the other hand , through an analysis of the spatial and temporal correlations , we provided a numerical confirmation that the extremal optimization method is not a soc dynamics but a non - critical algorithm with an infinite spatial range and an exponential time decay of the avalanches .",
    "the two dynamics : the bak - sneppen with noise ( bsn ) and the extremal optimization ( eo ) are then investigated with respect to their efficiency to minimize energy .",
    "there is an optimal interval of the parameter @xmath0 where eo is superior to bsn .",
    "to explain our main ideas , we have chosen the one dimensional p - states chiral clock model ( @xmath10 ) @xcite as our experimental system . in higher dimensions ,",
    "this system exhibits a complex phase transition diagram with commensurate and incommensurate phases . in one dimension , the competition between the applied magnetic field , which tries to align the spins , and the chirality , which tries to flip them , gives rise to a rich ground - state diagram in the space of the parameters .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by    @xmath11\\ } = -\\sum_{i=1}^{n } \\lambda_{i}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath12 is a positive integer number , @xmath13 is the spin variable at the site @xmath2 ( with periodic boundary conditions applied ) and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the magnetic field and chirality , respectively . by symmetry arguments , @xmath14 and @xmath15",
    "may be restricted to the intervals @xmath16 $ ] and @xmath17 $ ] .     versus the chirality @xmath15 for the ground state diagram of the @xmath18 chiral clock model .",
    "the regions @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 have periods 1 , 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "the marked points @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 were tested for the universality of the bsn dynamics.,width=302 ]    for @xmath18 , the chiral clock model has 3 regions with different ground - states ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 the regions with periods 1 , 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "the numbers correspond directly to the sequence of the spin states .",
    "the region @xmath20 is super degenerate , i. e. , the spin state sequence 12 may be equally followed by 12 or 13 . for a finite ring",
    ", this means that the degenerescence of this region grows exponentially with the lattice size .",
    "we choose the following form for the fitness @xmath26",
    "@xmath27 + \\notag \\\\ & & \\frac{1}{2 } [ 1-\\cos(2 \\pi ( \\frac{s_{i}-s_{i-1}}{p } - \\delta ) ) ] + \\notag \\\\ & & \\frac{1}{3 } h [ 1-\\cos(2 \\pi ( \\frac{s_{i+1}-1}{p } ) ) ] + \\notag \\\\ & & \\frac{1}{3 } h [ 1-\\cos(2 \\pi ( \\frac{s_{i}-1}{p } ) ) ] + \\notag \\\\ & & \\frac{1}{3 } h [ 1-\\cos(2 \\pi ( \\frac{s_{i-1}-1}{p}))]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    there is a certain art and arbitrariness to select the fitness form .",
    "for instance , one could equally well have chosen a pre - factor 1/4 for the magnetic fields at the sites @xmath28 and @xmath29 and 1/2 for the site @xmath2 .",
    "different fitness forms may lead to quite different values of some physical quantities determined by the dynamics , e. g. , the average energy in the stationary state .",
    "the fitness defined by equation ( 2 ) is the form with the highest symmetry - the magnetic field is equally distributed between the sites @xmath29 , @xmath2 and @xmath28 as well as is the chirality between the pair of sites @xmath30 $ ] and @xmath31 $ ] .",
    "it represents the best result we got for the average energy in a bunch of trials .",
    "let us now describe our procedure .",
    "initially , to each site @xmath2 of the ring , we attribute by chance one of the @xmath12 possible values of the spin variable @xmath1 .",
    "using equation ( 2 ) , we calculate all the corresponding fitness @xmath26 and find the smaller ( worst ) one @xmath32 .",
    "new spin variables are then randomly assigned to the sites @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "so although the dynamics involves 3 spins , due to our fitness definition , it affects ( changes ) 5 consecutive fitness ( from the site @xmath36 to @xmath37 ) .",
    "observe that here the bak - sneppen dynamics is being applied to the _ spin configuration _ space not to the _ fitness _ space itself ( as it was originally done in the evolutionary context @xcite ) . in the final step , a new site with the smallest fitness is searched and the whole process continues as long as we wish .",
    "however , even for a modest lattice size , this dynamics is _ hampered _ by the discrete fitness variability .",
    "let us explain why .",
    "if @xmath18 ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 fixed ) there are at most 27 possible values of the fitness ( besides , some of these may be degenerate ) .",
    "this means that , for a lattice with a reasonable size , we will generally find not just _ one _ but a _ large _ number of sites with exactly the _",
    "same_(smallest ) fitness value .",
    "the simplest solution to the problem seems to put all those sites in a list and to choose one of them at random .",
    "we will call this dynamics as the bak - sneppen with draw ( bsd ) . as we shall see later ,",
    "neither from the point of view of the spatial correlations nor from the time correlations is this dynamics a true soc .",
    "it is the discrete variability of the fitness ( or , equivalently , of the spin variable ) which precludes the establishment of a self - organized critical state , so we searched a simple way to solve the problem .",
    "suppose that a noise @xmath38 is added to the original spin variable @xmath1 ( an integer in the interval @xmath39 $ ] ) , i. e.    @xmath40    where @xmath41 $ ] is a random number generated from a flat distribution .",
    "the new spin variable @xmath42 as well as the corresponding fitness have now the desired continuous characteristic . by choosing the noise @xmath38 sufficiently small",
    "the relevant physical properties ( like the energy per site or the magnetization per site ) will not be affected . in this paper",
    "we set @xmath43 . using double numerical precision , we varied @xmath44 from @xmath45 up to @xmath46 with no important difference for the physical quantities . with this trick",
    ", any previously discrete fitness @xmath47 is turned into a continuous variable inside some interval @xmath48 controlled by the noise @xmath49 , the chirality @xmath50 and the magnetic field @xmath14 .",
    "we will call this dynamics as the bak - sneppen with noise ( bsn ) .",
    "our next objective is to compare the 3 dynamics eo , bsd and bsn with respect to their efficiencies .    in order to guarantee that the stationary state had already been reached and to get good averages for the physical quantities , a huge amount of computation was performed . using the same fitness definition ( equation ( 2 ) ) for all the three algorithms bsd , bsn and eo , we simulated each one of them over @xmath51 @xmath52 runs on a ring of 4001 sites . discarding the first @xmath53 @xmath54 runs ( @xmath55 of the total ) as the transient time",
    ", averages were then taken over the remaining steps .",
    "the results for the energy histograms are shown in figure 2 .     and @xmath56 ) , bsn and bsd dynamics .",
    "they were determined at the point @xmath24 of the figure 1 .",
    "the exact ground state energy per spin is 0.8055.,width=302 ]    the simulations were done at the point @xmath24 of the region @xmath57 ( see figure 1 ) where the ground state energy per spin is equal to @xmath58 .",
    "the best performance was obtained by the eo algorithm with @xmath59 , followed by the eo with @xmath60 , bsn and bsd .",
    "their respective mean energies were @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "to study the spatial correlation , we measured the distribution @xmath65 , of the distance @xmath66 between two subsequent activated sites @xcite .",
    "recall that for the three algorithms we activate a site @xmath2 by changing its spin state @xmath1 and the corresponding fitness @xmath4 .",
    "we plotted @xmath67 in the figure 3 .     versus the distance @xmath66 between two subsequent activated sites .",
    "the algorithm eo shows an infinite spatial range while the bsn algorithm has a power law scaling.,width=302 ]    clearly , eo is an algorithm with an _ infinite spatial range _ - it does nt matter how far one site is of the other , the activation probability is constant . on the other hand ,",
    "the bsn algorithm exhibits a _ power law _ dependence @xmath68 with the exponent being compatible with that of the bak - sneppen model ( @xmath69 @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , we got at the points @xmath22 , @xmath70 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( see figure 1 ) the same exponent value , indicating that the universality principle holds in the space of the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 . finally , from the figure 3 we conclude that the bsd algorithm is of a mixed kind , having the bsn behavior for small distances and the eo for large distances .    in the stationary regime ,",
    "the bsn dynamics shows an intermittent time evolution with long periods of passivity interrupted by sudden bursts of activity , i. e. , it exhibits a _",
    "punctuated equilibrium_. this abrupt change of activity is called an avalanche .",
    "we say that an avalanche is happening if there exist one site of the ring whose fitness is smaller than a certain threshold @xmath71 .",
    "the size @xmath72 of an avalanche is defined as the number of subsequent time steps with at least one fitness below that threshold . for each one of the three dynamics we calculated the probability distribution of the avalanches @xmath73 .",
    "the results are illustrated in the figure 4 .",
    "versus the avalanches size @xmath72 for the bsn , eo and bsd algorithms in ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively .",
    "the insets correspond to the fitness histograms evaluated at the time step @xmath51 @xmath74.,width=302 ]    the figures 4(a ) , 4(b ) and 4(c ) correspond to the bsn , eo and bsd algorithms , respectively .",
    "before we analyze @xmath73 , let us first discuss how the critical thresholds were obtained . at the time step @xmath51 @xmath74 ( the end of the transient period ) and with the magnetic field and chirality fixed at the values @xmath75 and @xmath76 ,",
    "respectively , we determined the fitness histograms of the whole ring .",
    "they are shown as insets of the figure 4 . since in the eo and the bsd algorithms",
    "there are only some few possible values for the fitness @xmath47 ( a maximum of 27 when @xmath18 and many of them are degenerate ) , we may vary the ( discrete ) @xmath47 values until the avalanches are founded .",
    "remember that if @xmath77 there will be no avalanches while if @xmath78 only one ( infinite ) avalanche is present .",
    "due to the discreteness values of @xmath47 , it is very improbable to find the system in a sub or supercritical regime .",
    "we found @xmath79 and @xmath80 for the eo and bsd dynamics , respectively . for the bsn algorithm , however , the fitness is continuous .",
    "there is a fitness fluctuation @xmath81 due to the presence of the noise @xmath38 . in our case ,",
    "the maximum value of the relative fluctuation @xmath48 / @xmath47 is @xmath82 @xmath46 . to find the critical threshold",
    ", we wrote a program which varies the fitness values ( inside the range @xmath48 ) until the resulting avalanches have sizes between 500 and 2000 ( which seems reasonable to avoid the sub and supercritical regimes ) .",
    "we determined @xmath83 .",
    "we can now go back to the probability distribution of the avalanches @xmath73 .",
    "they were all calculated at their respective thresholds @xmath71 .",
    "the eo algorithm ( figure 4(b ) ) shows an _ exponential _ decay with @xmath72 .",
    "the bsn ( figure 4(a ) ) , on the other hand , has a _ power law _ scaling @xmath84 .",
    "this value is somewhat discrepant from that of the evolutionary bak - sneppen model ( @xmath85 @xcite ) , but we should remember that , for our system , the exact determination of the critical threshold position is much more difficult and one can easily be found in a sub or supercritical regime . for the bsd algorithm ( figure 4(c ) ) , we found once more a mixed behavior described by @xmath86 .",
    "based on the bak - sneppen ideas , we proposed an optimization algorithm whose dynamics , in the steady state regime , exhibits self - organized criticality .",
    "it has been successfully applied to find the ground states of the clock chiral model and it can be easily extended to any other magnetic system . from the three dynamics studied in this paper ,",
    "we conclude that only the bsn algorithm conducts the system to a self - organized critical state .",
    "the essential point was to recognize that the discrete fitness values , present in the eo and bsd algorithms , preclude the system to have a power law decay of the spatial correlation . to overcome this problem we introduced a small noise in the spin configuration space .",
    "another important conclusion we arrived is that to possess soc characteristics does not guarantee a dynamics to be optimal .",
    "this statement was proved here for the eo algorithm .",
    "the eo algorithm , which is not soc since it has an infinite spatial range and the avalanches decay exponentially , has a peak of the energy histogram ( with @xmath59 ) which is only @xmath87 further from the exact ground state value .",
    "this is a stunning result which can not be beaten by the bsn dynamics . at @xmath88 ,",
    "the eo and bsn are almost equivalent . on the other hand ,",
    "the bsd algorithm is of a mixed type .",
    "it can be obtained by taking the limit @xmath89 in the bsn .",
    "finally , it is important to observe that , contrary to what happens with bsn , the eo algorithm has one arbitrary and free parameter @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath90 , eo becomes a random walk and if @xmath91 , the system may stack in a dead end . in both limits , the eo efficiency is completely spoiled and an optimal value of @xmath0 should be found in somewhere between . in the bsn dynamics",
    "there is no tuning parameter . using the ideas described here , we wish to develop a soc optimization algorithm to some classical combinatorial problems like the bipartition of graphs ."
