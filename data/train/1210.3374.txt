    "stars which pass too close to supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) are disrupted by the enormous gravitational gradients acting on them .",
    "the eventual fallback of @xmath1 of the star s mass onto the black hole can produce a highly luminous , multiwavelength flare - the primary observable signature of a tidal disruption event ( tde ) .",
    "over a dozen strong tde candidates have been observed , with most detections made in x - ray @xcite or uv @xcite , but some in optical archival @xcite and transient @xcite searches .",
    "recently , collimated jets from two relativistic tde candidates have been detected by the swift satellite @xcite .",
    "the rate of tdes is highly uncertain , from both theoretical and observational perspectives . on the observational side , uncertainties stem from both the low sample size and unclear sources of systematic error ; nonetheless , observational estimates of the tde rate per galaxy generally find @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this is in rough agreement with the wide range of theoretical predictions for the tde rate , which invoke different ways to scatter stars into the smbh `` loss cone '' ( the region of low angular momentum phase space containing orbits which pass inside the tidal sphere ) .",
    "the most theoretically secure method of feeding stars into the loss cone is standard two - body relaxation , which sets a conservative lower limit on @xmath3 between @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "alternative mechanisms for enhancing the tde rate include triaxiality in a galaxy s nuclear potential @xcite , encounters with massive perturbers @xcite , the effect of an inspiraling secondary smbh @xcite , and gravitational wave recoil after the merger of a binary smbh @xcite .    past theoretical work on tdes",
    "has included analytic estimates of event energetics and timescales @xcite , hydrodynamical simulations of the disruption process in both smoothed - particle - hydrodynamics @xcite and mesh @xcite codes , and radiative transfer work to quantify emission and absorption processes in tdes @xcite .",
    "the large hierarchy of time and length scales involved in a tde makes it difficult to self - consistently simulate one from disruption to the onset of accretion , so other work has focused on the formation @xcite and evolution @xcite of tde accretion disks .",
    "the properties of these flares depend crucially on the spread in orbital specific energy of the post - disruption debris streams , as that spread sets the mass fallback rate onto the smbh .",
    "all fallback rates are generally expected to produce multicolor blackbody emission from the accretion disks they feed @xcite , while super - eddington fallback rates may drive powerful outflows , increasing the optical luminosity by orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "much of the pioneering work on tdes was done in the 1980s using the semi - analytic affine model ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter cl83 ) , which treats the disrupting star as a set of concentric ellipsoidal shells evolving under the combined influences of self - gravity , pressure , and the smbh tidal field @xcite .",
    "this model has found a wide range of uses , and has been generalized to include both thermonuclear reaction networks @xcite and general relativistic ( gr ) effects @xcite , although its validity tends to break down at late times as the stellar debris exits the tidal sphere .",
    "one key finding of the affine model is that during the early stages of disruption , prior to the star s arrival at pericenter , motion orthogonal to the orbital plane decouples from motion within , leading to a strong , one - dimensional compression ( a vertical `` pancaking '' ) of the star .",
    "this effect scales strongly with the penetration factor @xmath0 , defined as the ratio of the tidal radius @xmath6 to the pericenter radius @xmath7 .",
    "the pancaking of the star is reversed by the buildup of internal pressure , which leads to a rebound in the vertical direction .",
    "shock formation accompanies this rebound ( and occasionally the infall period prior to maximum compression ) , with x - ray shock breakout a potential though as yet undetected observational signature of tdes @xcite .    in this paper , after establishing basic dynamical features of tdes (  2 ) we present a new analytic model to analyze the tidal free fall of the star prior to its maximum vertical compression (  3 ) . in many ways ,",
    "this represents a simplification of the affine model , and its primary appeal is its greater analytic tractability . using our model we correct a longstanding error in the literature on the spread in debris energy @xmath8 .",
    "we verify the robustness of our estimates by considering redistribution of vertical collapse energy to in - plane motion (  4 ) , the desynchronization of vertical collapse (  5 ) , and leading - order gr corrections (  6 ) , the latter of which are found to be small .",
    "we examine the gravitational waves ( gws ) generated by rapid changes in the star s quadrupole moment during maximum compression , and find them to be detectable by advanced ligo for disruptions of white dwarfs (  7 ) .",
    "we conclude with the observational implications of our work , which primarily involve the suppression of strongly super - eddington tdes (  8) , and a general discussion (  9 ) .",
    "a star is tidally disrupted if the pericenter of its orbit , @xmath7 , lies inward of the tidal radius , @xmath9 here @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the mass and radius of the victim star , and @xmath12 is the black hole mass . in reality",
    ", this expression for the tidal radius is not exact and contains weak , order unity dependences on stellar structure @xcite , stellar spin , and black hole spin @xcite .",
    "we ignore these complications in this paper . very shortly after entry into the tidal sphere ( and before pericenter passage for @xmath13 ) , the smbh s tidal forces do an amount of work exceeding the star s gravitational binding energy , and the star s fluid elements begin moving on roughly geodesic trajectories . in the standard picture ,",
    "hydrodynamic forces are subsequently neglected and the specific orbital energy @xmath14 of the debris streams is `` frozen in , '' with a spread given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the gravitational constant and @xmath17 a constant of order unity related to stellar structure and rotation prior to disruption .",
    "this approximate estimate can be obtained by taylor - expanding the smbh potential around the star at pericenter , or alternatively by multiplying the equivalent tidal acceleration at pericenter @xmath18 by the dynamical time @xmath19 to get @xmath20 .",
    "using @xmath21 , one can then find @xmath22 .",
    "we note that eq .",
    "[ uncorrectedenergy ] is widely used in the literature @xcite .",
    "however , this reasoning is incorrect ; by the time the star reaches pericenter its fluid elements are moving on almost ballistic trajectories .",

    "@xmath24 is the orbital separation .",
    "the work done by internal forces decreases more slowly , @xmath25 , although this simple expression overestimates the amount of work done by internal forces , which at @xmath26 will self - cancel each other to first order ( given that the star is initially in hydrostatic equilibrium ) .    to accurately evaluate @xmath27 at pericenter passage",
    ", one would need to account for distortions in the free - falling star s physical shape , as well as internal velocities . at any point along the star s orbit , a cartesian coordinate system @xcite will define the principal axes ( eigenvectors ) of the tidal tensor .",
    "if we define @xmath28 parallel to the vector connecting the star and smbh , @xmath29 in the orbital plane but perpendicular to @xmath28 , and @xmath30 perpendicular to the orbital plane , the star will be stretched in the @xmath28 direction but compressed in the @xmath29 and @xmath30 directions .",
    "the compression along the @xmath29 axis reduces the potential gradient across the star , invalidating the above formula ; further inaccuracy is introduced by the internal motions ( i.e. velocity shear among ballistic debris trajectories ) of the star within the smbh s tidal sphere",
    ". a more accurate estimate of the spread in specific energy can be found by taking the potential gradient at the moment of tidal disruption , i.e. when the star crosses the tidal sphere and becomes unbound , as after this point the motion of the debris becomes roughly geodesic .",
    "this revision to the approximation of energy freeze - in yields @xmath31 we note that an analogous conclusion ( on the @xmath0-independence of the energetics of tidal disruption ) can be seen in tidal separations of binary stars by smbhs ( * ? ? ?",

    "the observational implications of changes to @xmath8 are discussed in  8 .",
    "other factors could influence or invalidate the simple analytic argument presented in  2 , such as redistribution of energy during the moments of maximum compression , gr corrections , stellar spin , or simply work done on the star s fluid elements by subdominant internal forces inside the tidal sphere . in this section ,",
    "we introduce a new analytic model for the tidal free fall of a disrupted star that will help us approach these issues .",
    "because the dominant source of tdes is expected to be stars scattered onto radial orbits from @xmath37 pc scales @xcite , we assume a parabolic orbit for the center of mass of the star , with distance from the smbh given by : @xmath38 for such an orbit time @xmath39 is related to true anomaly @xmath40 via @xmath41 although the differential form @xmath42 is more generally useful .",
    "we set @xmath43 at @xmath44 , and use @xmath45 throughout this paper",
    ".    the sequence of events in a tde , first noted by cl83 , will be useful shorthand for us , so we introduce it here",
    ". phase i ( near - equilibrium ) of a tde lasts while @xmath46 , and the star remains in approximate if slightly perturbed equilibrium .",
    "phase ii ( free fall ) begins when the star crosses the tidal sphere and becomes gravitationally unbound ; in this paper we will treat the transition between phases i and ii as instantaneous , an assumption we justify below in  5 .",
    "the assumption of tidal free fall is very useful because of the existence of analytic , `` free '' solutions to the hill equations in the parabolic restricted 3-body problem , but it is not immediately obvious that internal forces in the star can be neglected for @xmath47 . to first order",
    "the approximation seems reasonable because the ratio of tidal acceleration to self - gravitational acceleration grows quickly , as @xmath23 for the bulk of the star .",
    "furthermore , the star s internal pressure and self - gravity partially cancel each other , further reducing their combined contribution . for",
    "now , we assume the validity of the free fall assumption , but after developing further machinery we will justify it further in  5 .    during this free fall ,",
    "the star is compressed perpendicular to the orbital plane ( along @xmath48 ) and in one direction within the orbital plane , while being stretched along the other in - plane direction .",
    "although for the limiting case of radial infall the problem is self - similar in all three dimensions ( skr10 ) , the rotation of the line connecting the star s center of mass to the smbh breaks the in - plane similarity . by the time the star has reached pericenter , the @xmath49 direction ( which is parallel to the line between the smbh and the orbital pericenter ) ,",
    "is compressed , and @xmath50 is stretched , but the distortions are both much smaller than the compression orthogonal to the orbital plane . shortly after passing pericenter , synchronous tidal free fall in the @xmath48 direction leads to very strong compression of the star , which is eventually reversed by hydrodynamic forces .",
    "phase iii ( bounce ) begins when hydrodynamical forces become strong enough to begin slowing the collapse of the star along its vertical axis .",
    "once the star s collapse has reversed , hydrodynamical forces quickly become negligible again , and phase iv ( the rebound ) begins , with stellar gas once again moving on ballistic trajectories .",
    "we take as initial conditions for phase ii a spherically symmetric star at the tidal sphere , with fluid elements possessing initial positions @xmath51 ( the coordinate origin tracks the star s center of mass ) and initial velocities in the center of mass frame @xmath52 . making the approximation that upon entering the tidal sphere , internal forces become negligible unless and until compression triggers shock formation or isentropic pressure buildup",
    ", we take the pre - shock trajectories of these fluid elements to be completely ballistic .",
    "this means that their trajectories are given by the parabolic hill equations , @xmath53 .",
    "the free solutions to these equations , neglecting self - gravity , can be written in closed form ( skr10 ) using coordinates where distance has been normalized by @xmath54 and time by @xmath55 ; we denote such coordinates in this paper by writing tildes over them .",
    "all other coordinates are in physical units , unless otherwise noted .",
    "although there are 6 independent solutions to these equations , motion out of the orbital plane is decoupled from motion within it , so only two are relevant for perturbed motion in the @xmath48 direction : @xmath56 here @xmath57 and @xmath58 are undetermined coefficients that are set by the initial conditions described above .",
    "in particular , if we require that a fluid element of initial position @xmath59 has initial velocity @xmath60 at @xmath61 , where the true anomaly upon entry into the tidal sphere is given by @xmath62 then @xmath63 if we introduce a tidal potential @xmath64 felt in the rest frame of the star , the tidal acceleration is given by skr10 as @xmath65 we note that the self - similarity of eq . [ selfsimilar ] implies that the free solutions all collapse to @xmath66 simultaneously at a true anomaly @xmath67 , although physically this collapse will be reversed shortly before by the buildup of pressure gradients strong enough to counteract the tidal forces compressing the star .",
    "however , it is useful to solve for @xmath67 using eq .",
    "[ ansatz ] : @xmath68 from this formula we see that in the limit of @xmath69 , collapse along the z - axis occurs at @xmath70 , i.e. at pericenter , while in the marginal disruption limit of @xmath71 , collapse occurs at @xmath72 , i.e. at a fixed point past pericenter .",
    "we have already mentioned that the free solutions become less valid for small @xmath0 due to the increasing importance of internal forces , but we can see from eq .",
    "[ fc ] a second , stronger , inconsistency at low @xmath0 , which is that the free solutions dictate vertical collapse after the disrupted star leaves the tidal sphere , i.e. @xmath73 .",
    "this occurs for @xmath74 .",
    "although the onset of phase iii is dictated by compression in the @xmath48 direction , the outcome of the bounce will be affected by motion within the orbital plane during phase ii , when @xmath75 .",
    "we therefore describe here the free solutions within the orbital plane ( skr10 ) :    @xmath76    if we consider a point on the star with an initial position , relative to the star s center of mass , of @xmath77 and zero initial velocity ( here , as before , `` initial '' refers to @xmath61 , i.e. crossing into the tidal sphere ) , then we have 4 initial conditions for 4 unknowns : @xmath78 . using eq .",

    "in this paper , we have analyzed the tidal disruption and free fall of a star in the context of `` free solutions '' to the hills equations of the parabolic restricted three - body problem .",
    "the important conclusions of this work are the following :    1 .   during the tidal disruption of a star ,",
    "debris energy freezes in at @xmath120 , not @xmath44 .",
    "2 .   consequently",
    ", the spread in debris energy is smaller than in past analytic predictions .",
    "this will result in flares with longer fallback times , i.e. ones that decay more slowly but have smaller initial fallback rates .",
    "fewer tdes will drive powerful super - eddington outflows than has been predicted in the past .",
    "the spread in debris energy is generally dominated by the freeze - in energy , although redistribution of the kinetic energy of vertical collapse to in - plane motions may result in slight variation in @xmath27 for low @xmath357 . rapidly spinning stars",
    "may see a stronger version of this effect at high @xmath0 if their spins are misaligned with the orbital angular momentum vector .",
    "4 .   the leading order gr corrections to the frozen - out value of @xmath8 are small , and generally negligible unless @xmath358 . for such tdes ( i.e. all tdes for smbh masses above @xmath359 )",
    "we have derived for the first time the 1pn modifications to @xmath8 .",
    "the free solution model we have introduced is , in the limit of spherical and static initial conditions , an approximate simplification of the affine model .",
    "however , the ability to include a range of nonspherical or dynamic initial conditions gives it a degree of flexibility not present in the affine model .",
    "furthermore , the deformations to an initially spherical body in tidal free fall are not ellipsoids , as is assumed by the affine model .",
    "gravitational waves are generated from variation in the internal quadrupole moment of a tidally disrupting star , reaching peak amplitude at the moment of maximum compression and bounce .",
    "gw emission is likely dominated by a single term in the quadrupole moment tensor , @xmath360 . for main sequence stars ,",
    "these are unlikely to be detectable by ground - based gw interferometers .",
    "gws from the tidal disruption of wds by imbhs are more promising targets , and for modest @xmath0 values ( @xmath361 ) could be detectable to tens of megaparsecs .",
    "gravitational wave emission from nondiagonal terms in the star s quadrupole moment could alter the previous conclusion , since @xmath362 .",
    "however , in order for these terms to possess a nonzero prefactor , the reflection symmetry of the tde about the orbital plane must be broken by either smbh or stellar spin . whether this can be done without desynchronizing the vertical collapse and weakening",
    "the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath363 is unclear .",
    "the existing hydrodynamical literature did not until very recently support the first three of these conclusions . with a few exceptions ,",
    "prior work has focused mainly on the common @xmath339 events , for which eqs .",
    "[ uncorrectedenergy ] and [ correctedenergy ] are identical . in @xcite",
    ", the authors conducted sph simulations in a static schwarzschild background geometry for @xmath364 .",
    "they found that the fallback time scaled approximately as @xmath365 and the velocity of unbound ejecta @xmath366 , both of which imply the intermediate value of @xmath367 , for the power - law index defined in eq .",
    "[ paramenergy ] as @xmath368",
    ". however , the limited resolution of their simulations ( 7000 sph particles ) makes it unclear whether they would have possessed the midplane resolution to resolve the phase of maximum compression ; indeed , they find that @xmath369 , a scaling well below analytic predictions as well as the higher - resolution one - dimensional simulations of bl08 .",
    "it is also possible that our approximations have underestimated the efficiency with which the bounce phase can redistribute the energy of vertical collapse to motions within the orbital plane , perhaps due to neglect of gr effects during phase iii .",
    "alternatively , the simulations of @xcite may be altered by entropy production due to artificial viscosity , as suggested by the authors .",
    "more recent hydrodynamical simulations of high-@xmath0 disruptions did not publish details on the spread of debris energy @xcite , although we note that @xcite , using a one - dimensional mesh code , found results in qualitative agreement with bl08 . on the other hand , @xcite found a vastly lower degree ( @xmath370 ) of central compression for a @xmath207 event than what is predicted analytically , by the affine model , or by one - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations , with the difference attributed to a combination of insufficient midplane resolution and the physical , three - dimensional effects discussed in  5 .",
    "however , we have shown that these multidimensional effects are unlikely to be large due to the proximity of the sonic point to the region of maximum compression .    during the completion of this paper , an independent numerical study @xcite",
    "was posted which found an approximate constancy in @xmath27 for @xmath371 , in the course of a thorough investigation of low-@xmath0 tdes .",
    "this result is broadly compatible with our paper , although further hydrodynamical simulations will be required to explore high @xmath0 values , and to test our prediction of desynchronized collapse for rapidly rotating , misaligned stars ( which could restore a @xmath0 dependence to @xmath8 , for deeply plunging disruptions ) . like @xcite",
    ", we argue that the assumption of frozen - in debris energy is made much more valid by assuming the energy freezes in when internal forces become negligible at @xmath120 , not at later times .",
    "we note that the free solutions are of course an approximation to the physical reality of tidal disruption , and neglect a number of important physical effects .",
    "some areas in particular need of further clarification by hydrodynamical simulation are the velocity and shape perturbations induced on the star by the nonlinear hydrodynamics of tidal disruption at @xmath26 .",
    "although bl08 found these effects to generally be negligble for phase ii and iii of a tde , their simulations were one - dimensional and it is conceivable that in three dimensions the picture may change .",
    "the free solutions also fail to capture gr effects relevant for large @xmath0 values , although we have argued based on our own analysis and past literature that these effects do not qualitatively change our conclusions .",
    "furthermore , we have not considered the effects of smbh spin , which if misaligned with the orbital plane may be able to desynchronize stellar collapse .    despite these limitations ,",
    "the free solutions are a simple yet powerful method for considering the tidal free fall of disrupted bodies .",
    "although we have focused on the disruption of main sequence stars by supermassive black holes , we stress that much of our analysis is general and applies equally well to other scenarios , such as tidal disruption of white dwarfs by intermediate mass black holes , or of planets or asteroids by more compact bodies . in all of these scenarios , the decoupling of vertical from in - plane motion",
    "will strongly compress the disrupted object , often by many orders of magnitude . in future work",
    ", we aim to apply the free solutions to these alternative physical regimes , as well as to internal motions such as pre - disruption rotation or post - disruption shock formation .",
