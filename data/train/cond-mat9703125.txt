    "anomalous 4@xmath1- and 5@xmath1-compounds , including so - called kondo lattices and heavy - fermion systems , are studied extensively starting from the middle of 80s @xcite . from very beginning of these investigations",
    "it became clear that the effects , connected with regular arrangement of the kondo centres ( rare - earth or actinide ions ) play a crucial role in the physics of such systems . when passing from one magnetic centre to the kondo lattice ,",
    "two main new features appear .",
    "first , provided that the strong coupling regime takes place , the abrikosov - suhl resonance in the one - site @xmath2-matrix leads to formation of a complicated band structure near @xmath3 on the new energy scale ( the kondo temperature @xmath4 with sharp peaks and pseudogaps in the density of states@xcite .",
    "this provides a common explanation of the heavy - fermion behavior .",
    "second , the competition between the kondo screening of magnetic moments and intersite magnetic interactions has a great importance @xcite . following to the old paper by doniach @xcite ,",
    "it was believed in early works that this competition leads to total suppression of either magnetic moments or the kondo anomalies .",
    "however , more recent experimental data and careful theoretical investigations made clear that the kondo lattices _ as a rule _ demonstrate magnetic ordering or are close to this .",
    "this concept was consistently formulated and justified in a series of our papers @xcite .",
    "a very important circumstance is that interspin coupling between the kondo sites results in a smearing of singularities in electron and magnetic properties on the scale of the characteristic spin - dynamics frequency @xmath5 at the same time , @xmath6 itself acquires renormalizations resulting in its decrease due to the kondo screening . a simple scaling consideration of this renormalization process in the @xmath0 exchange model @xcite yields , depending on the values of bare parameters , both the `` usual '' states ( a non - magnetic kondo lattice or a magnet with weak kondo contributions ) and the peculiar magnetic kondo - lattice state . in the latter state ,",
    "small variations of parameters result in strong changes of the ground - state moment .",
    "thus a characteristic feature of heavy fermion magnets  high sensitivity of the ground - state moment to external factors like pressure and doping by a small amount of impurities  is naturally explained . at the same time , only the simplest @xmath0 model was considered in ref.@xcite , and the equations obtained were not investigated in detail",
    ". therefore a number of important features of the kondo magnets were not described .",
    "recently , a number of anomalous @xmath1-systems ( u@xmath7y@xmath8pd@xmath9 , upt@xmath10pd@xmath7 , ucu@xmath11pd@xmath7 , cecu@xmath12au@xmath7 , u@xmath7th@xmath8be@xmath13 etc . ) demonstrating the so - called non - fermi - liquid ( nfl ) behavior have become a subject of great interest ( see , e.g. , the reviews @xcite ) .",
    "it should be noted that such a behavior is observed not only in alloys , but also in some stoichiometric compounds , e.g. , ce@xmath14ni@xmath9 @xcite , cecu@xmath15si@xmath16ceni@xmath15ge@xmath15 @xcite .",
    "these systems possess unusual logarithmic or power - law temperature dependences of electron and magnetic properties .",
    "it is a common practice to discuss such a behavior within the one - impurity two - channel kondo model @xcite .",
    "however , the nfl behavior is typical for systems lying on the boundary of magnetic ordering and demonstrating strong spin fluctuations @xcite .",
    "so , many - center effects should play an important role in this phenomenon . at the same time , for a number anomalous @xmath1-systems as sm@xmath9se@xmath17 yb@xmath18as@xmath19 as well as for the only `` moderately heavy - fermion '' @xmath20-system y@xmath8sc@xmath7mn@xmath16 the heavy - fermion state itself seems to be connected with peculiarities of intersite couplings ( e.g. , frustrations ) , rather than with the one - impurity kondo effect@xcite .",
    "thus the interplay of the kondo effect and intersite spin dynamics results in very rich and complicated picture rather than in trivial mutual suppression .",
    "the aim of the present paper is a systematic investigation of formation of the magnetic kondo - lattice state and of its properties for various magnetic phases depending on the character of spin dynamics .    in sect.2",
    "we introduce main theoretical models which enable one to treat the kondo effect in a lattice in different cases with account of orbital degeneracy . in sect.3",
    "we analyze the properties of the localized spin subsystem for these models in the absence of @xmath0 interaction .",
    "the kondo renormalizations in the paramagnetic state with account of spin dynamics are considered in sect.4 . in sects.5 and 6 we calculate the kondo corrections to the electron spectrum ( and thereby to the effective @xmath0 coupling ) and magnon frequencies in the magnetically ordered phases . in sect.7",
    "we write down the scaling equations for the effective @xmath0 parameter and spin - fluctuation frequency which plays the role of a cutoff for the kondo divergences in concentrated @xmath1-systems . in sect.8",
    "we generalize the scaling approach for the ordered state by including the renormalization of the residue of the spin green s function at the magnon pole . the most simple large-@xmath21 limit in the coqblin - schrieffer model where spin dynamics is unrenormalized",
    "is considered in sect.9 .",
    "the scaling picture for finite @xmath21 is discussed in sect.10 . in sect.11",
    "we discuss the critical behavior near the magnetic phase transition and discuss a possibility of the fermi - liquid picture violation .",
    "the scaling behavior in the @xmath0 exchange model with a large orbital degeneracy is investigated in sect.12 , and an explicit description of the non - fermi - liquid behavior is obtained in this limiting case .",
    "to treat the kondo effect in a lattice we use the @xmath22 exchange hamiltonian @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the band energy .",
    "we consider the pure spin @xmath25exchange model with @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are spin operators and their fourier transforms , @xmath29 are the pauli matrices . for the sake of convenient constructing perturbation theory",
    ", we explicitly include the heisenberg exchange interaction with the parameters @xmath30 in the hamiltonian , although in fact this interaction can be the indirect rkky coupling . expanding the @xmath22 interaction in spherical functions we have @xmath31",
    "hereafter we retain in ( [ yy ] ) only one term @xmath32 ( @xmath33 for @xmath20-electrons and @xmath34 for @xmath1-electrons ) . introducing the operators @xmath35 which satisfy , after averaging over the angles of the vector * k * , the fermi commutation relations",
    ", we reduce @xmath36 to the form @xmath37 assuming the electron and spin excitation spectrum to be isotropic , in final expressions for self - energies we can perform averaging over the angles of all the wavevectors and use the orthogonality relation @xmath38 thus the factors of @xmath39=(2l+1)$ ] occur in any order of perturbation theory , and we have to replace @xmath40i_l^n$ ] in the `` connected '' terms of perturbation expansion in comparison with the `` standard '' @xmath41 model ( @xmath42 .",
    "it is worthwhile to remember main results for the one - impurity version of this model @xcite .",
    "perturbation theory treatment leads to occurrence of infrared divergences .",
    "provided that @xmath43 the characteristic energy scale ( the kondo temperature ) @xmath44 occurs , where @xmath45 is of order of bandwidth , @xmath46 is the bare density of electron states at the fermi level with one spin projection . at @xmath47",
    "the effective @xmath0 interaction becomes very large and the system enters the strong coupling regime .",
    "the electron energy spectrum in this region is determined by the presence of the abrikosov - suhl resonance of the width @xmath48 properties of the ground state and character of the low - temperature behavior depend crucially on the parameters @xmath49 and @xmath39.$ ] at @xmath50 $ ] the fermi - liquid singlet state occurs . at",
    "@xmath51 $ ] the localized moment and logarithmic behavior of electronic characterisitics retains , but the replacement @xmath52/2 $ ] takes place . at @xmath53 $ ] a very interesting `` overcompensated ''",
    "regime occurs .",
    "last time , the particular case of this regime with @xmath54=2 $ ] ( the two - channel kondo model describing the non - fermi - liquid behavior , see , e.g.,@xcite ) is a subject of great interest .    in the case of the periodic model presence or absence of the strong coupling regime",
    "depends also on the character of intersite spin - spin interactions which are described by @xmath55 this factor will be analyzed in detail below .",
    "the @xmath22 model does not take into account scattering by orbital degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "another important model , which is used frequently to describe the kondo effect , is the coqblin - schrieffer model . for its periodic version with the @xmath56 exchange interaction of the @xmath57 form",
    "we have @xmath58 where @xmath59 are the fourier transforms of the hubbard s operators for the localized spin system @xmath60 @xmath61 is the total angular momentum ( this notation is used for the sake of convenience and has a somewhat different meaning in comparison with the spin @xmath49 in the @xmath0 model ) , the operators @xmath62 possess , after averaging over the angles , the fermi properties due to the orthogonality relations for the clebsh - gordan coefficients @xmath63 . as well as for the model ( [ sfe ] ) , we will assume that this averaging should be performed when calculating the green s functions .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath36 with @xmath64 can be derived from the degenerate anderson - lattice model for rare - earth compounds ( @xmath65-coupling ) ; a hamiltonian of the same form occurs in the case of @xmath66-coupling ( actinide systems ) @xcite .",
    "for @xmath67 the models ( [ sfe ] ) and ( [ cs ] ) reduce to the standard @xmath0 model with @xmath68 and coincide .",
    "the ground state in the one - impurity coqblin - schrieffer model is similar to that in the @xmath0 model with @xmath50,$ ] i.e. complete screening of the localized moment and a fermi - liquid picture take place . due to another structure of perturbation theory for the coqblin - schrieffer model , we have to replace @xmath69 in ( [ tk ] ) .",
    "thus the role of the degeneracy factors in both the models under consideration is different : the expression for @xmath70 does not contain the factor of @xmath39=(2l+1)$ ] in the model ( [ sfe ] ) , but contains the factor of @xmath21 in the model ( [ cs ] ) .",
    "peculiarities of the coqblin - schrieffer model are determined by that the transitions between any values of localized @xmath1-state projection @xmath71 are possible , so that the number of excitations branches is large .",
    "we shall see that this may result in essential modifications of magnetic behavior .",
    "the interaction @xmath72 in ( [ cs ] ) can be obtained as an indirect rkky - type interaction which arises to second order in @xmath36 .",
    "using the standard heisenberg interaction ( as in ( [ sfe ] ) ) , where only @xmath73 transitions are allowed , is incovenient since other transitions acquire an energy gap .",
    "however , inclusion of this interaction does not lead to a strong change of the physical picture.the standard angular momentum operators on a site are expressed in terms of the @xmath74-operators as @xmath75    of course , both the @xmath0 exchange model and coqblin - schrieffer model are some idealizations of realistic situation .",
    "choice of adequate model for a given compound depends mainly on the relation between the width of @xmath1-level and the spin - orbital coupling parameter .",
    "if the broadening of @xmath1-level due to either the hybridization or direct @xmath76 overlap is larger than its spin - orbital splitting we should consider the latter after the transition from atom - like @xmath1-states to the crystal states .",
    "usually the orbital moment is quenched in bloch - like states @xcite and therefore only the spin moment should be taken into account when considering the interaction with conduction electrons .",
    "the coqblin - schrieffer model was initially proposed to describe cerium and ytterbium systems , especially diluted ones @xcite . however , as it is clear now , the situation for cerium compounds is more complicated .",
    "first , the spin - orbit coupling for cerium is in fact not too large ( about 0.25 ev ) and comparable with the width of the virtual @xmath1-level .",
    "second , a number of cerium system , including the pure @xmath77cerium have rather large @xmath76 overlap ( the relative role of @xmath76 overlap and hybridization is discussed in detail in the review @xcite ) .",
    "thus the applicability of one of these models should be considered separately for any specific compound .",
    "we shall demonstrate below that results of the scaling consideration for the coqblin - schrieffer model and @xmath0 exchange model are essentially different .",
    "the model ( [ cs ] ) may be generalized to include two magnetic @xmath1-configurations with the angular moments @xmath78 and @xmath79 so that @xmath80 ( we restrict ourselves for simplicity to the case of @xmath66-coupling bearing in mind uranium compounds ) .",
    "however , this hamiltonian has a complicated tensor structure @xcite and does not enable one to calculate an unique energy scale by using perturbation expansion .",
    "such an energy scale can be obtained starting from the low - temperature regime and reads@xcite @xmath81   \\label{twom}\\ ] ] ( note that the exponent in ( [ twom ] ) for the case @xmath82 differs by an unity from the correct result ; such a difference is typical for the methods which are in fact based on the large-@xmath21 expansion @xcite ) . in the case",
