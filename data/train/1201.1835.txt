    "since the introduction of the aloha protocol @xcite , several random access ( ra ) schemes have been introduced . among them , some feedback - free ra protocols originally proposed in @xcite re - gained attention in the recent past @xcite . in @xcite , the capacity of the so - called collision channel without feed - back ( ccw / ofb ) was analyzed , assuming slot - aligned but completely asynchronous users transmissions . moreover , a simple approach to achieve error - free transmission over the ccw / ofb was proposed .",
    "the approach of @xcite consists of assigning different periodic protocol ( access ) sequences to the users .",
    "each sequence defines in which slots each user is allowed to access the shared channel .",
    "furthermore , the users encode their packets by means of erasure correcting codes .",
    "the user s packet can be recovered whenever a sufficient number of codeword segments are received collision free .",
    "hence , by selecting proper protocol sequences , it is possible to ensure that a sufficient number of segments per user are recovered , even if the beginning of the different protocol sequences is unsynchronized . in this way , a capacity equal to @xmath1}$ ] is achieved as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the number of users accessing the ra channel .",
    "the same capacity is achieved also in the unslotted case .",
    "although simple , the approach of @xcite poses some challenges , especially if a large ( and varying ) number of users has to be served @xcite .",
    "recently , ra schemes profiting from sic have been introduced and analyzed @xcite .",
    "these schemes share the feature of canceling the interference caused by collided packets on the slots where they have been transmitted whenever a clean ( uncollided ) copy of them is detected . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the successive interference cancellation ( sic ) process can be well modeled by means of a bipartite graph .",
    "the analysis proposed in @xcite resembles density evolution analysis of low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) and doubly - generalized ldpc ( d - gldpc ) codes over erasure channels @xcite . by exploiting design techniques from the ldpc context , a remarkably - high throughput ( e.g. up to @xmath4}$ ] )",
    "can be achieved in practical implementations .",
    "the schemes considered in @xcite assume a feedback from the receiver to achieve a zero packet loss rate .",
    "furthermore , the approaches proposed in @xcite has been recently considered for inclusion in the next generation digital video broadcasting return channel via satellite ( dvb - rcs ) standard @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the application of sic to collision channels without feedback . with respect to @xcite ,",
    "the proposed ra scheme does _ not _ require the assignment of protocol sequences to users , who select time slots for their transmissions in a randomized and uncoordinated fashion .",
    "the proposed scheme stems from the coded slotted aloha ( csa ) protocol proposed in @xcite .",
    "each user splits his generic packet into segments , that are encoded through a binary linear ( erasure ) block code chosen on a packet - by - packet basis , according to some probability distribution .",
    "the resulting encoded segments are then transmitted in time slots selected with uniform probability out of the slots composing the medium access control ( mac ) frame .",
    "if for a packet a sufficient number of encoded segments are correctly received , its entire set of encoded segments can be recovered by the erasure code .",
    "moreover , the contribution of interference of cleaned segments can be canceled from the slots in which they caused collisions .",
    "it is shown how , iterating this process , for a channel traffic below a threshold value , arbitrarily low error probabilities can be achieved .",
    "we refer to this threshold as the _ capacity _ of the scheme . by suitably selecting the distribution of erasure codes , capacities close to @xmath5}$ ]",
    "can be obtained .",
    "it is also shown that there is a fundamental trade - off between the rate of the scheme and its capacity .",
    "an upper bound on the capacity is proved , and code distributions tightly approaching it derived .",
    "we consider a slotted ra scheme where slots are grouped in mac frames , all with the same length ( in slots ) .",
    "each user is frame- and slot - synchronous , and attempts one _ burst _",
    "( i.e. , packet ) transmission per mac frame . consider @xmath3 users , each attempting the transmission of a burst of time duration @xmath6 over a mac frame of time duration @xmath7 .",
    "neglecting guard times , the mac frame is composed of @xmath8 slots .",
    "we say that the offered ( channel ) traffic is @xmath9 .",
    "user @xmath10 encodes them by a @xmath11 linear block code , users @xmath12 and @xmath13 by a @xmath14 single parity - check ( spc ) code .",
    "the darkened squares denote parity segments . ]",
    "the proposed access scheme works as follows . prior to transmission of a user s burst of time duration @xmath6",
    ", the burst is divided into @xmath15 information _ segments _ , each of time duration @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath15 information segments are then encoded by the user via a packet - oriented linear block code generating @xmath17 encoded segments , each of time duration @xmath18 . for each transmission , the @xmath19 code",
    "is chosen randomly by the user from a set @xmath20 of @xmath21 candidate codes .",
    "for @xmath22 the code @xmath23 has length @xmath17 , dimension @xmath15 , rate @xmath24 , and minimum distance at least @xmath12 .",
    "each code @xmath23 has no idle symbols . at any transmission",
    ", each user draws his local code from the set @xmath25 independently of his previous choices and without any coordination with the other users .",
    "the code is drawn according to a probability mass function ( p.m.f . ) @xmath26@xmath27 which is the same for all users .",
    "the mac frame is composed of @xmath28 slots .",
    "slots is instrumental to the definition of load @xmath29 only .",
    "the actual minimum unit that can be allocated to a segment transmission are the sub - slots . ] the @xmath17 coded segments are then transmitted by the user over @xmath17 slots picked uniformly at random .",
    "an example for @xmath30 is provided in fig .",
    "[ fig : cra_model ] . for the special case of @xmath31 , @xmath32 and",
    "each @xmath23 is a repetition code of length @xmath17 .",
    "the overall _ rate _ of the scheme is defined as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the expected length of the code .",
    "does not represent the average code rate @xmath35 adopted by each user .",
    "it is easy to prove ( jensen s inequality ) that the average rate @xmath36 is lower bounded by @xmath37 .",
    "] we also define the polynomial @xmath38 and the polynomial @xmath39 , where @xmath40 .",
    "we refer to @xmath41 as the component code distribution .",
    "we adopt a graph representation of the ra scheme , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : cra_graph ] ( related to the same example as fig .",
    "[ fig : cra_model ] ) . consider @xmath3 users transmitting over a frame composed of @xmath28 slots .",
    "the situation can be represented by a bipartite graph , @xmath42 , consisting of a set @xmath43 of @xmath3 _ burst nodes _ ( one for each user ) , a set @xmath44 of @xmath28 _ sum nodes _",
    "( one for each slot ) , and a set @xmath45 of edges .",
    "an edge connects the @xmath46-th burst node ( bn ) to the @xmath47-th sum node ( sn ) if and only if an encoded segment associated with the burst of the @xmath46-th user is transmitted in the @xmath47-th slot .",
    "the number of edges connected to a bn or sn is the node degree .",
    "therefore , a burst encoded via the code @xmath23 is represented as a degree-@xmath17 bn , and a slot where @xmath48 segments collide as a degree-@xmath48 sn . moreover , a bn where @xmath23 is used during the current transmission is named a bn of type  @xmath49 .    .",
    "subslots are represented by sns , bursts by bns .",
    "each segment corresoends to an edge . ]",
    "each coded segment associated with a type-@xmath49 bn is equipped with information about its relevant user and with pointers to the other @xmath50 segments of the user .",
    ", one may include in the segment header the code index @xmath49 together with a random seed , out of which it is possible to reconstruct ( by a pre - defined pseudo - random number generator ) the positions of the @xmath17 segments .",
    "] we assume that collisions are always detected at the receiver and that they determine a complete loss of information about the colliding segments .",
    "we also assume that , when a burst is received in a clean slot , it is always successfully decoded . therefore ,",
    "after transmission , we can think of each bn as connected to `` known '' edges and to `` unknown '' ones , so that some of its information segments are known , and the others unknown . at a bn of type @xmath49 , erasure decoding of the code",
    "@xmath23 may recover some of the unknown encoded and information segments .",
    "it is now possible to subtract the interference contribution of the newly recovered encoded segments from the signal received in the corresponding slots .",
    "if @xmath51 segments that collided in a sn of degree @xmath48 have been recovered by the corresponding bns , the remaining segment becomes known .",
    "the sic process combined with local decoding at the bns proceeds iteratively , i.e. , cleaned segments may allow to resolve other collisions .",
    "in this paper , ideal sic is assumed .",
    "this procedure is equivalent to iterative decoding of a d - gldpc code over the erasure channel , where variable nodes are generic linear block codes and check nodes are single - parity - check ( spc ) codes .",
    "in this section , the evolution of the sic process for given @xmath15 and @xmath29 , in the asymptotic case where @xmath52 ( and @xmath53 ) is overviewed .",
    "most of the results presented in this section were developed in @xcite .",
    "this serves to define the extrinsic information transfer ( exit ) functions for the bn and sn sets , used in the proof of our main result presented in section  [ sec : capacity ] , and to formalize the concept of capacity under iterative sic .",
    "we start by briefly recalling the definition of information function of a linear block code @xcite .",
    "consider an @xmath54 linear block code @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the codeword length and @xmath15 the code dimension , and let @xmath57 be any generator matrix of @xmath55 .",

    "next , assume that maximum a - posteriori ( map ) decoding is used locally at each bn . at the @xmath46-th iteration of the sic process ,",
    "let @xmath61 be the average probability that an edge is connected to a sn associated with a slot where a collision still persists , before map decoding is performed at each bn .",
    "moreover , let @xmath62 be the average probability that an edge is connected to a bn whose contribution of interference on the corresponding sn can not be yet canceled , after map decoding has been performed at each bn . then : @xmath63 = : f_{\\mathsf{b}}(p_{i-1 } ) \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] adopting a consolidated terminology in the theory of modern error correcting codes , the function @xmath64 is referred to as the average exit function of the bn set .",
    "it is easy to verify that @xmath65 where @xmath66\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is called the average exit function of a type-@xmath49 bn , under map decoding .    equation [ eq : q_i(p_i-1 ) ] allows to update @xmath62 given @xmath61 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath67 on @xmath62 is instead obtained by observing that the number of segments received in a slot follows the distribution @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the probability to receive @xmath70 segments in the generic slot . defining @xmath71 and letting @xmath72 ,",
