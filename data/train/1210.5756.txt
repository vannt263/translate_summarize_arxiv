    "<S> the contact graph of an arbitrary finite packing of unit balls in euclidean 3-space is the ( simple ) graph whose vertices correspond to the packing elements and whose two vertices are connected by an edge if the corresponding two packing elements touch each other . </S>",
    "<S> one of the most basic questions on contact graphs is to find the maximum number of edges that a contact graph of a packing of n unit balls can have . in this paper , improving earlier estimates , we prove that the number of touching pairs in an arbitrary packing of @xmath0 unit balls in @xmath1 is always less than @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , as a natural extension of the above problem , we propose to study the maximum number of touching triplets ( resp . , quadruples ) in an arbitrary packing of @xmath0 unit balls in euclidean 3-space . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we prove that the number of touching triplets ( resp . , quadruples ) in an arbitrary packing of @xmath0 unit balls in @xmath3 is at most @xmath4 ( resp . , @xmath5 ) . </S>"
