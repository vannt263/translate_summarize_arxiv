    "the physical picture of the phenomenon studied here suggests that the ir dressing laser pulse couples the singlet autoionizing states 2s2p ( @xmath0 ) , 2p@xmath1 @xmath2and the continuum states made accessible by the ir pulse .",
    "the energy difference between the ground state and the lowest odd - parity , singlet excited state - 1s2p(@xmath7p@xmath77 ) of the field - free atom is so high that it requires more than 18 photons to be absorbed to excite the ground state by the ir pulse .",
    "transitions of higher orders would thus be necessary to excite higher excited states directly from the ir pulse acting on the ground state .",
    "therefore , it is a reasonable assumption to neglect the ir coupling of the ground state with excited states .",
    "note that the weak effect of the ir field for intensities considered in this work is also suggested in ref .",
    "therefore , the matrix elements of the dipole operator in the interaction matrix for the ir field @xmath78 were explicitly set to zero ( considering the ground state the first element in the basis set ) .",
    "this assumption allows for a dramatic improvement in the convergence of the solutions of the tdse with respect to the size of the basis set . on the other hand , it is the primary role of the xuv probe laser pulse to couple the ground state with the autoionizing state 2s2p ( @xmath0)and with nearby continuum states . since it has rather high photon energy and low intensity ( perturbative regime ) , it is unlikely that the xuv coupling between the doubly - excited states and the continuum states will play any significant role .",

    ". it would also then be necessary to perform the propagation of the wave function until the time @xmath87 .",
    "although the total wave function described by the vector @xmath69 changes at times @xmath88 due to the presence of the cap , the population of the ground state will remain constant after the end of the pulses , since the ground state wave function is well localized in the region where the cap is zero .",
    "therefore , for the purpose of the present project it is enough to perform the propagation until @xmath89 and extract the population of the ground state @xmath90 .",
    "the approximation that the ir field does not affect the ground state allows for the start of the propagation at time @xmath91 and terminate it at time @xmath92 . in view of the long duration of both pulses , this is an important simplification of the numerical calculations .",

    "this allows to relate the theoretical results presented here with the experimental transient absorption spectra published in ref .",
    "although we have found that the eigenrepresentation of the atomic hamiltonian @xmath44 without the cap is more practical for the solutions of the tdse  ( [ eq : approxmat ] ) , it is useful to study the spectrum of the complex symmetric hamiltonian @xmath93 .",

    "in addition , the density of the discretized continuum states must be sufficient to accurately describe the interaction between the autoionizing states and the continuum and to allow for converged calculation of the photoionization yield .",
    "these properties of the basis set are controlled by the size of the box @xmath95 , the position of the absorbing boundary @xmath42 and the strength of the cap @xmath94 , as is described in ref .",
