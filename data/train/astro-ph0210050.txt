    "the evolution of supermassive black holes and that of their host galaxies appear to be closely coupled .",
    "every bulge system studied with high spatial resolution shows a central black hole , presumably a relic of agn activity ( kormendy  & richstone 1995 ; richstone  1999 ; kormendy & gebhardt 2001 ) . the black hole mass is roughly proportional to the luminosity of the bulge of the host galaxy , albeit with scatter of @xmath5  dex in  ( magorrian  1998 ) .",
    "gebhardt  ( 2000a ) and ferrarese  & merritt ( 2000 ) found a tighter correlation involving  and @xmath1 , where @xmath1 is the stellar line - of - sight velocity dispersion at radii outside the gravitational influence of the black hole .",
    "tremaine et al .",
    "( 2002 ) give this relationship as @xmath6 with an intrinsic scatter @xmath7 .",
    "( the measure of scatter here is 1  @xmath8 for at fixed bulge luminosity or @xmath1 , respectively . )",
    "theoretical interpretations of this correlation ( e.g. , silk  & rees 1998 ; adams  2001 ; burkert  & silk 2001 ; ostriker 2001 ; balberg  & shapiro 2002 ; haehnelt  & kauffmann 2000 ) variously would have the black hole form before , during , or after bulge formation .",
    "given this uncertainty , measurements of  in galaxies with large look - back times would be valuable .",
    "most promising would be a measurement of the  relationship at high redshift , because the relatively small scatter of this relationship in the local universe should make it possible to discern even modest changes over time .",
    "unfortunately , measurements of  and @xmath1 at high redshift are challenging because spatially resolved kinematical studies are feasible only for nearby systems .",
    "however , recent work indicates that useful measures of  in agn are possible ( see peterson 1997 ; wandel , peterson , & malkan 1999 ) .",
    "mclure  & dunlop ( 2001 ) and wandel ( 2001 ) summarize the `` reverberation '' and `` photoionization '' methods to measure  in seyfert galaxies .",
    "the results correlate with bulge luminosity in a way consistent with nearby galaxies , confirming the calibration of for agn . however , the host galaxy brightness is difficult to measure in the presence of a bright active nucleus , and a direct measurement of @xmath1 for quasar host galaxies using stellar absorption - lines is likewise difficult .",
    "alternatively , the narrow emission - line widths can serve as a surrogate for @xmath1 .",
    "nelson  & whittle ( 1996 ) find agreement between narrow emission - line widths in agns and widths measured from stellar absorption - line kinematics . on this basis , nelson ( 2000 ) proposes to use the width of the [ oiii ] @xmath9 lines of agn as a surrogate for @xmath1 .",
    "thus , one takes @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and fwhm is the full width at half maximum .",
    "the divisor 2.35 relates @xmath8 and fwhm for a gaussian profile .",
    "taking black hole masses from reverberation mapping , nelson finds no systematic offset in the  relationship between low redshift agn measured this way and measurements of galaxies based on observed stellar velocity dispersions .    in this paper",
    ", we use emission - line widths to study the relationship for a sample of quasars at redshifts up to 3.3 .",
    "our goal is to assess the evolutionary history of black hole growth compared with that of the host galaxy . in section 2",
    ", we describe the derivation of  and the use of the [ o  iii ] line width as a surrogate for @xmath1 .",
    "then we describe our adopted data set , which relies on published data covering a range of redshift together with our unpublished observations of low redshift qsos . in section 3 , we present the results , and we examine the trend of  with @xmath12 and the redshift dependence of this relationship . in section 4 , we discuss these results and the needed improvements . throughout our discussion",
    ", we use a cosmology with @xmath13 .",
    "all values of luminosity used in this paper are corrected to our adopted cosmological parameters .",
    "the derivation of black hole masses from agn broad line widths has been discussed by a number of authors , recently including laor ( 1998 ) , wandel  ( 1999 ) , kaspi  ( 2000 ) , vestergaard ( 2002 ) , and mclure & dunlop ( 2001 ) .",
    "the method relies on assuming that the line widths , at least for some lines , are dominated by orbital motion of the emitting gas in the gravitation potential of the black hole .",
    "this is supported by the generally symmetrical time variability of the wings , and the decrease in line width with increasing radius for different lines in a given object ( see wandel  1999 , and references therein ) . the black hole mass is then given by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are an appropriate velocity and radius for the blr .",
    "deriving @xmath15 and @xmath16 from the observations is not entirely straightforward , as the emitting gas spans a range of radii and velocities .",
    "pragmatically , the radius is derived from `` reverberation mapping '' or `` echo mapping '' studies that monitor the variation of the continuum and emission lines .",
    "the characteristic time lag between continuum variations and the response of a given line gives a measure of the radius of the region emitting that line ( see review by peterson 1993 ) .",
    "given this determination of @xmath16 , one needs a measure of line width which , combined with this radius , gives the correct black hole mass .",
    "this choice can be parameterized as @xmath17 for the line .",
    "some authors use @xmath18 , appropriate for isotropic velocities .",
    "however , mclure & dunlop ( 2001 ) argue that allowance for a flattened geometry of the blr is preferable .",
    "most work has employed the balmer lines , in particular .",
    "black hole masses determined in this way for agn with measured @xmath1 show overall agreement with the  relationship ( gebhardt  2000b ; ferrarese  2001 ; mclure & dunlop 2001 ) .",
    "the work of wandel  ( 1999 ) and kaspi  ( 2000 ) generated a set of blr radii based on variability of the balmer lines for 17 seyfert 1 ( sy 1 ) galaxies and 17 pg qsos .",
    "this work supports earlier indications that the blr radius increases with luminosity , approximately as @xmath19 .",
    "photoionization physics suggests @xmath19 , and this is also consistent with the idea that the blr radius may be limited by the minimum radius at which dust grains survive ( netzer & laor 1993 ) .",
    "this relationship is enormously useful , for it opens the door to measuring black hole masses in large numbers of agn from measurements of line width and luminosity at a single epoch . by determining the blr radius in this way",
    ", one avoids the need for long series of observations of variability , which are in any case impractical for luminous , high redshift qsos with long variability timescales .",
    "the use of such `` photoionization masses '' , calibrated in terms of echo results , has been discussed by several authors , including wandel  ( 1999 ) and vestergaard ( 2002 ) .",
    "there is some controversy over the slope of the radius - luminosity relationship .",
    "kaspi ( 2000 ) find @xmath20 , based on echo radii .",
    "however , mclure & jarvis ( 2002 ; see also maoz 2002 ) , find @xmath21 . on this basis , they fit the echo masses with @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 , using the same cosmology that we have adopted .",
    "the difference in slope results from several factors , including a new echo mass for ngc 4051 , different continuum luminosities , and the cosmological model .",
    "here we take for our primary calibration the physically motivated slope @xmath19 .",
    "we adopt the @xmath25 fit shown in figure 6 of kaspi , @xmath26 where we have adjusted the coefficient to our cosmology .",
    "( this expression agrees with our own fitting of the kaspi et al data and depends little on ngc 4051 because the slope is fixed . )",
    "we use the  line width in this fashion to determine , adopting the calibration of equation ( 2 ) for most of our discussion but illustrating the key results also for @xmath27 .",
    "mclure & jarvis and vestergaard ( 2002 ) discuss the use of other lines .",
    "the use of the @xmath28 continuum follows wandel  ( 1999 ) and kaspi  ( 2000 ) .",
    "mclure & jarvis ( 2002 ) and laor  ( 1997 ) argue that the @xmath29    continuum may work better , but the differences are not great .",
    "the @xmath30 continuum has the practical advantage that it can be measured in the same spectra as the and  lines , and it is less affected by dust extinction .",
    "nelson & whittle ( 1996 ) have compared [ o  iii ] line widths and stellar velocity dispersions in agn , finding generally good agreement . for the quantity log @xmath31",
    ", they find a mean @xmath32 and a dispersion @xmath33 , supporting the idea that the motions of the nlr gas are largely determined by the gravitational potential of the host galaxy .",
    "this is reinforced by the analysis by nelson ( 2000 ) , who shows essentially that  and  obey equation ( 1 ) for agn with echo values of @xmath0 .",
    "these results support the use of @xmath12 as a surrogate for @xmath1 .",
    "a caution , however , is that [ o  iii ] profiles often have substantial asymmetry and non - gaussian profiles , possibly resulting from outflow combined with extinction of the far side of the nlr ( e.g. , wilson & heckman 1985 ; nelson & whittle 1995 ) .",
    "radio loud agn tend to have stronger [ o  iii ] emission than radio quiet objects , as reflected in `` eigenvector 1 '' of boroson & green ( 1992 ) .",
    "radio jets may contribute to the motions of the nlr gas ( nelson & whittle 1996 ) .",
    "for this reason , we emphasize radio quiet objects in this paper , and we discuss radio loud objects separately .",
    "we include here results from an unpublished set of spectra of qsos obtained at mcdonald observatory with the large cassegrain spectrograph ( lcs ) on the 2.7-meter telescope .",
    "these objects correspond to the x - ray sample studied by laor et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , which is in turn taken from the bright quasar survey based on the palomar green ( pg ) survey ( boroson & green 1992 ; schmidt & green 1983 ) .",
    "we take values of fwhm(@xmath34 ) from boroson & green .",
    "the instrumental resolution was 150 to 180  fwhm , depending on redshift .",
    "emission from fe ii blends was removed from the spectra with the aid of the boroson & green ( 1992 ) template .",
    "table 1 gives the widths for 2 rl and 14 rq objects in the redshift range 0.09 to 0.33 derived from our spectra .",
    "we use here the results of directly measuring the half - maximum point of the observed line profile rather than by fitting any kind of curve .",
    "the width of @xmath35 was noted for corroboration .",
    "( see below for a discussion of methods of measuring the [ o  iii ] line width . ) our own measurements of fwhm for  ranged from 0.95 to 1.35 times the bg92 values , with a mean ratio of 1.09 .",
    "this may give some indication of systematic uncertainties arising from fe ii subtraction and fitting procedure , although real temporal variations may affect individual objects .",
    "for our pg sample , continuum luminosities were taken from laor  ( 1997 ) .",
    "table 2 lists the redshift , adopted line widths , continuum luminosity , and black hole mass derived from equation ( 2 ) .",

    "the quantity @xmath69 is then a measure of the vertical deviation of a given object from the tremaine  ( 2002 ) mean trend in figures 1 - 3 . in figures 4 and 5",
    ", we plot this quantity as a function of redshift for our full and select rq samples , respectively . in the mean ,",
    "the high redshift objects show little deviation from the  trend . because the most massive objects are the high redshift objects , we can not independently assess the slope of the  relationship and the redshift dependence .",
    "our point is that _ the data are consistent with a  relationship that extends to high masses with a slope close to that of tremaine  ( 2002 ) and that does not evolve strongly with time . _    a quantitative measure of the adherence of the high redshift objects to the low redshift trend is difficult , given the small number of high redshift objects in the select sample and the various systematic errors .",
    "we may estimate the intrinsic scatter of the high redshift samples on the basis of the pg sample , which has the higher luminosity of the low redshift samples .",
    "the rq objects in our pg sample show a mean @xmath70 of + 0.10 and a dispersion 0.5 ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "the mean of @xmath70 is -0.11 for the 9 high redshift rq objects in the select sample .",
    "the standard deviation of the mean for these 9 objects , if drawn from a population with similar dispersion to the pg sample , would be about 0.2  dex . for the full rq sample , there are 23 objects with a mean @xmath70 of -0.15 , which suggests that there is no significant bias in our select sample .",
    "these results indicate that , at times corresponding to redshifts @xmath72 to 3 , the average  at a given  was within a factor 2 or 3 of the present day value .",
    "one systematic uncertainty is the slope of the radius ",
    "luminosity relationship for the blr .",
    "the high redshift rq select objects are on average 1.8  dex more luminous than the pg sample .",
    "use of the mclure and jarvis ( 2002 ) relationship , with @xmath21 , elevates the high redshift points by @xmath68  dex in figures 1 - 5 while having little effect on the low redshift samples .",
    "this brings the high redshift and pg samples into even closer agreement , with a mean @xmath70 of + 0.15 for the rq pg sample and + 0.14 for the rq high redshift select sample .",
    "figure 6 shows @xmath70 versus redshift for the mclure and jarvis calibration ( given before equation  2 above ) .",
    "another uncertainty is the slope of the  relationship , discussed by tremaine  ( 2002 ) .",
    "the high redshift objects in figure 1 have @xmath73 .",
    "if the slope were @xmath74 rather than @xmath75 , for example , the predicted mass for the high redshift objects would be lowered by about 0.2  dex .",
    "this would raise these objects by this amount in figures  4 - 6 .",
    "there are two main points that come from our analysis .",
    "first , figures  1 and 2 show that we can place agn on the  correlation using the [ oiii ] emission - line width as a surrogate for @xmath1 .",
    "this bypasses the need to obtain high signal - to - noise spectra in order to obtain the host galaxy absorption line kinematics .",
    "nelson ( 2000 ) was the first to point this out .",
    "we confirm it with our independent data set including luminous qsos and using photoionization masses rather than reverberation masses .",
    "second , given that one can measure [ oiii ] line profiles at fairly modest signal - to - noise levels in agn , one can now study the relationship between black holes and their host galaxies at high redshift .",
    "although a larger sample of high redshift objects is needed , figures  4 - 6 suggests that the  relationship is not a strong function of redshift . for the adopted cosmology , the age of the universe was 2.0 gyr at @xmath76 and 3.3 gyr at @xmath77 .",
    "the objects in this redshift range have black hole masses up to @xmath78 and implied host galaxy masses up to @xmath79 , if @xmath80 ( kormendy & gebhardt 2001 ) .",
    "our results suggest that black holes typically grow contemporaneously with their host galaxy bulges , or else that both were well formed by @xmath4 .",
    "recent results on black hole demographics suggest that high mass black holes acquire most of their mass from luminous accretion during episodes of qso activity ( yu & tremaine 2002 , and references therein ) .",
    "yu & tremaine find that half the black hole mass is accreted before a redshift @xmath81 , and only 10% before @xmath82 .",
    "thus , our results suggest that the black hole - galaxy bulge relationship is roughly obeyed , at least by very massive holes , at a time when much of the growth of present - day black holes lay in the future .",
    "previous workers have noted a tendency for [ o  iii ] widths to increase with luminosity for agn ( e.g. , b96b ; m99 ; vron - cetty , vron , & gonalves 2001 ) . in the present context , this is a natural consequence of the tendency to have larger  in more luminous objects , together with the  relationship .",
    "b96b suggested that the mass of the host galaxy might be involved in the increase of [ o  iii ] width with luminosity .",
    "the conclusion that galaxy growth is contemporaneous with black hole growth is consistent with chemical abundances in qsos .",
    "heavy element abundances in luminous qsos are solar or several times solar ( hamann  2002 ) .",
    "the highest abundances are typically found in the centers of large galaxies ( e.g. , garnett  1997 ) .",
    "we have crudely estimated bolometric luminosities for the agn in our sample by taking @xmath83 ( kaspi   2000 ) .",
    "on average the various data sets have @xmath84 , where the eddington limit @xmath85 is calculated from @xmath86 .",
    "this ratio shows little systematic difference between the samples at higher and lower luminosity or redshift .",
    "some individual objects exceed the eddington limit on this basis , but only by amounts that may be consistent with uncertainties in  and @xmath87 .",
    "the use of  provides a new way to estimate black hole masses in agn .",
    "once the systematics of the [ o  iii ] profile are understood in this context , black hole masses from  may be as reliable as `` photoionization masses '' based on  width and continuum luminosity .",
    "the availability of two independent estimates of  will allow workers to compare each for consistency with other approaches , such as accretion disk fitting of the continuum energy distribution ( e.g. , mathur  2001 ) .",
    "both measures of  may likewise be examined for systematic correlations with various properties of agn , such as the correlation of @xmath88 with `` eigenvector 1 '' found by boroson ( 2002 ) .",
    "the  relationship offers , in principle , a new standard candle for cosmology .",
    "the value of  derived from the broad  line width varies as @xmath89 , with @xmath90 to 0.6 ( see discussion preceding equation 2 ) . if one assumes that either  or  correctly predicts  through equation ( 1 ) , then equation ( 2 ) can be solved for @xmath91 in terms of  and fwhm(h@xmath2 ) .",
    "this gives @xmath92 however , the use of equation ( 3 ) for cosmological measures will be challenging , given the large exponents of @xmath93 and @xmath94 and the uncertainties in the calibration of the  and @xmath95 relationships .",
    "future work on this topic should include a systematic examination of the best way of characterizing the width of the [ o  iii ] lines for use in predicting @xmath1 and calibration of the chosen measure .",
    "use of shorter wavelength narrow lines such as [ o ii ] would allow study of higher redshift objects at a given observed wavelength .",
    "an obvious need is for more and better observations of the  and [ o  iii ] region in high redshift qsos . in order to minimize the uncertainty associated with the scaling of blr radius with luminosity",
    ", observations of high and low redshift qsos should be made as nearly as possible at similar intrinsic luminosity .",
    "high resolution imaging studies may provide direct measures of the host galaxy luminosity as a check on @xmath12 .",
