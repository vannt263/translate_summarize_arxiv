    "after the discovery of the higgs boson @xcite , many questions regarding its properties remain unanswered . in the standard model ( sm ) , the higgs boson couples to fermions through yukawa interactions , which after electroweak symmetry breaking generate the fermion masses .",
    "these masses , which exhibit a large hierarchy spanning many orders of magnitude , enter as input parameters in the sm lagrangian , and the question whether their hierarchy follows a more fundamental pattern remains open .",
    "the fermion mass matrix is aligned with the yukawa couplings , and as a result the higgs couplings are flavor - diagonal in the physical basis .",
    "models beyond the sm exist , in which the higgs couplings to fermions are changed in a non - trivial way , potentially leading to sizeable deviations from the sm predictions and allowing for flavor - changing and cp - violating higgs interactions .",
    "additionally , heavy new particles can induce non - standard higgs couplings to gauge bosons . at present , the loop - induced @xmath4 couplings are least constrained by experimental data .",
    "it is of paramount importance to probe these couplings in any way conceivable .    in this work",
    "we advocate the use of the exclusive weak radiative higgs - boson decays @xmath8 , where @xmath2 denotes a meson and @xmath9 an electroweak gauge boson , as probes for non - standard higgs couplings .",
    "the case @xmath10 has already been studied in great detail in @xcite .",
    "the corresponding decay amplitudes receive contributions from two types of decay topologies , which interfere destructively : the `` direct contributions '' , which involve the coupling of the higgs boson to the quarks forming the meson , and the `` indirect contributions '' , in which the higgs decays to an off - shell vector boson that converts to the meson through a local matrix element .",
    "the direct amplitudes can be evaluated in the framework of the qcd factorization approach @xcite , in which the large separation between the hard scattering scale @xmath11 and the hadronic scale @xmath12 yields to a factorization of the amplitudes into convolutions of hard functions with light - cone distribution amplitudes ( lcdas ) for the meson @xmath2 .",
    "while the hard function can be calculated in perturbation theory , the lcdas encode the physics at the hadronic scale and have to be extracted from non - perturbative methods such as lattice gauge theory or qcd sum rules . for mesons containing heavy quarks , insight into the structure of the lcdas can be obtained using heavy - quark effective theories such as nrqcd and hqet .",
    "the qcd factorization formula can be derived elegantly using soft - collinear effective theory @xcite , as has been demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "the interplay between direct and indirect contributions gives rise to a strong sensitivity of the @xmath13 decay rates on the quark yukawa couplings .",
    "the aim of the present work is to investigate whether such an interference pattern persists in the case of the weak radiative decays @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and what other possibilities of probing new - physics effects open up in these modes . some of these modes have already been explored in the literature .",
    "the authors of @xcite have discussed the indirect contributions to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 decay amplitudes induced by the @xmath16 and @xmath17 vertices .",
    "they have missed the indirect contributions involving the effective @xmath4 vertex , which turn out to give the dominant effects for @xmath3 decay modes containing a light final - state vector meson .",
    "we also extend their work in an important way by performing a careful treatment of the flavor - specific decay constants of neutral mesons , and by evaluating the direct contributions to the amplitudes and studying to which extent these are suppressed . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "the decays @xmath18 and @xmath19 into heavy quarkonia have been analyzed including the indirect contributions involving both the @xmath16 and @xmath4 vertices .",
    "the second paper also provides an estimate of the direct contributions based on the non - relativistic approximation .",
    "the sign of the interference term of the two indirect contributions found by these authors appears to be opposite to the one we obtain , and as a result their branching ratios are typically about 40% larger than our values .",
    "the authors of @xcite have very briefly discussed the sensitivity of the @xmath20 decay rate to the flavor - changing higgs couplings to top and up quarks .",
    "our detailed analysis does not fully confirm the result presented in this paper .",
    "in our analysis we assume sm couplings for all particles other than the higgs boson .",
    "for the higgs interactions with sm particles , we use the phenomenological lagrangian @xmath21     & \\quad\\mbox{}+ \\frac{\\alpha}{4\\pi v } \\left (       \\kappa_{\\gamma\\gamma}\\,h\\,f_{\\mu\\nu } f^{\\mu\\nu }      - \\tilde\\kappa_{\\gamma\\gamma}\\,h\\,f_{\\mu\\nu } \\tilde f^{\\mu\\nu }       + \\frac{2\\kappa_{\\gamma z}}{s_w c_w}\\,h\\,f_{\\mu\\nu } z^{\\mu\\nu }       - \\frac{2\\tilde\\kappa_{\\gamma z}}{s_w c_w}\\,h\\,f_{\\mu\\nu } \\tilde z^{\\mu\\nu } \\right ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the sine and cosine of the weak mixing angle . here",

    "these couplings are so small that they will play no role in our analysis .",

    "the decays @xmath0 are interesting by the fact that the massive final - state gauge boson can be in a longitudinal polarization state . as a consequence , both pseudoscalar and vector mesons",

    ". we will thus keep the dependence on all masses in our analysis .",
    "the form factors in contain the direct and indirect contributions .",
    "we start with the indirect contributions , since they are found to give rise to the dominant effects .",
    "they involve hadronic matrix elements of local currents and hence can be calculated to all orders in qcd .",
    "we obtain @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the vector and axial - vector couplings of the @xmath45 boson to the quark @xmath47 .",
    "the flavor - specific decay constants @xmath60 and @xmath61 are defined in terms of the local matrix elements @xmath62 with @xmath63 .",

    "qcd corrections to the @xmath71 amplitude were calculated in @xcite and found to be very small , about 0.1% .",
    "to evaluate these expressions we use the running quark masses evaluated at the hard scale @xmath72gev , corresponding to twice the energy of the meson @xmath2 in the rest frame of the decaying higgs boson , in the limit where the meson mass is neglected .",
    "we use the running quark masses at next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) in the @xmath73 scheme , starting from the low - energy values given in @xcite .",

    "the stronger bound from cms implies the constraint @xmath93    the structure of the results for vector mesons in ( [ avindir ] ) is interesting . the photon - pole diagram in figure  [ fig : hmz ] yields contributions to the transverse form factors which are formally power - enhanced by @xmath94 , and after squaring the form factors this enhancement more than compensates for the suppression factor @xmath55 in ( [ hmzrates ] ) . by power",
    "counting these are thus the leading contributions to the decay rates .",
    "however , these contributions are suppressed by @xmath95 , and hence there is an subtle interplay of suppression factors at work .",

    "this was also noted in @xcite but overlooked in @xcite , where the photon - pole graph was neglected .",
