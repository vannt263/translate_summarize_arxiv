    "several works @xcite have provided a sound procedure to include resonance states within the chiral framework , namely the resonance chiral theory ( r@xmath5 t ) . as the couplings entering the effective lagrangian are not fixed by the symmetry alone , one should rely on the phenomenology or , alternatively , construct theoretical tools that could provide a meaningful way to compare the results of the effective theory with those of qcd . the pioneering work of ref .",
