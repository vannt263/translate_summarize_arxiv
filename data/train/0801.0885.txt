    "for example , the domain walls formed during the phase transition in the early universe has a topology of sphere but with a very complicated surface form .",
    "when these closed domain walls are turned out inside the horizon , they become self - gravitating . inside",
    "the horizon domain walls tend to obtain a spherical form due to surface tension , but at the same time they strongly oscillate and generate gravitational and scalar waves . as a result their mass gradually diminish .",

    "in fact , any inflationary model using potential with two or more minima must take into account this mechanism of primordial bhs overproduction .    in this paper",
    "we choose parameters of the potential which lead to formation of relatively small primordial bh clusters .",
    "we suppose that relatively small primordial bh clusters provide the major contribution to initial density perturbations which afterwards evolve into protogalaxies .",
    "the hierarchical clustering of protogalaxies during the cosmological time leads to the observable large scale structure .",
    "we describe the gravitational dynamics of dm coupled with primordial bh clusters and demonstrate that a protogalaxy could be formed without any initial fluctuations in dm density . in this case",
    "the clusters of primordial bhs play the role of initial fluctuations .",
    "two scenarios of supermassive bhs formation could coexist : ( i ) the most massive clusters of primordial bhs account for an early quasar activity @xcite , but ( ii ) less massive ( considered in this paper ) clusters of primordial bhs produce more numerous supermassive bhs observed nowadays in almost all structured galaxies .",
    "there are several stages of bhs and galaxies formation in the described scenario : ( i ) formation of closed walls of scalar field just after the end of inflation with a subsequent collapse some of these walls with formation of massive primordial bh cluster with the most massive bh in the center after the horizon crossing according to @xcite .",

    "the possibility of ig spiralling down to the galactic center by the influence of dynamical friction depends on the initial orbit of ig .",
    "suppose for estimation that orbit of ig is circular . by using the known expression for dynamical friction force @xcite and an equation for the angular momentum loss , one finds the differential equation for orbital radius evolution @xmath195 where @xmath196 , @xmath197 , @xmath198 . as it was shown above , the tidal stripping is ineffective and so the mass of ig @xmath199 .",
    "consider at first the density profile ( [ halonfw ] ) for our galaxy .",
    "it was formed when age of the universe was approximately one fourth of the nowadays days age .",
    "numerical solution of equation ( [ difdyn ] ) demonstrates that only igs inside the radius @xmath200  kpc have enough time to sink down into the galactic center .",
    "the typical elliptical galaxies are formed earlier than our galaxy and being much more denser .",
    "therefore , all igs in elliptical galaxies sank down to their centers .    according to observations the masses of central supermassive bhs in sa , sb , sc galaxies are in general smaller than those in e and s0 galaxies . in our model this",
    "is connected with a relatively late formation of sa , sb , sc galaxies , when the main part of primordial bhs have not enough time to sink down to the galactic center .",
    "in particular , @xmath201 bhs with mass @xmath202 enveloped by ig can inhabit in our galaxy .",
    "they could be observed as the widely discussed ultra - luminous x - ray sources .",
    "the fate of primordial bhs inside the central parsec of the host galaxy is rather uncertain .",
    "we suppose that during the hubble time major part of these bhs are merged into a single supermassive bh .",
    "namely , the dynamical friction is a very effective mechanism for bh merging at final stage because the density of ig , @xmath203 ( see in the fig .  [ solgen2 ] ) , is strongly growing towards the center and smoothed out only at very small distance @xmath170  pc from the central bh .",
    "an additional dynamical force is produced by interactions of igs with stars from the bulge and central star cluster . as a result , the late phase of bhs merging proceeds very fast .",
    "the probability of simultaneous presence in the galactic nucleus of three or more bhs is very low due to the slingshot effect . on the contrary",
    ", a substantial amount of massive bhs may inhabit the galactic halo , if they turn out rather far from the galactic center from the very beginning @xcite .",
    "our assumption of multiple merging of primordial bhs may be violated in the less dense galaxies of late hubble types .",
    "multiple coalescence of massive primordial bhs in the galaxies is inevitably accompanied by the strong burst of gravitational radiation .",
    "the future interferometric detector lisa is capable to detect these coalescence events .",
    "a simple estimation of the burst rate from an observable part of the universe gives @xmath204 where @xmath205 is a mean number density of structured galaxies ( galaxies with nuclei ) and @xmath31 is a mean number of merging events per galaxy .",
    "gravitational bursts provide the principal possibility for the verification of considered model by the lisa detector .",
    "recent observations ( see e.  g. @xcite ) reveal the correlations between the mass of the central supermassive bh ( sbh ) in the galactic nucleus @xmath206 and velocity dispersion @xmath207 at the bulge half - optical - radius : @xmath208 in other set of observations @xcite a different form of correlation was derived : @xmath209 .",
    "we show below that our model of igs reproduces correlations ( [ korsig ] ) . at the early stage of hierarchical clustering of small protogalaxies into the bigger ones",
    "the discussed primordial black holes are homogenously mixed with dm at the scales greater than igs .",
    "for this reason a total mass of these primordial bhs in any galaxy @xmath210 would be proportional to the galactic dm halo mass @xmath110 .",
    "after the final merging of primordial bhs into a single central bh the similar relation retains : @xmath211 . by taking in mind that velocity dispersion in galaxy is determined mainly by dm , one may expect the existence of some relation between @xmath206 and @xmath207 .",
    "we find the form of this relation in the following way .",
    "the condition for galaxy formation from a density fluctuation @xmath212 is @xmath213 where the function @xmath214 is from ( [ glam ] ) , @xmath215 is the threshold value of fluctuation for spherical collapse and @xmath110 is a mass of the galaxy . for fluctuation amplitude @xmath216",
    "we take the r.m.s .",
    "fluctuation ( [ sig ] ) , and so we neglect the distributions but take into account only the mean values . equation ( [ forcond ] )",
    "gives implicitly the functional dependance @xmath217 .",
    "the density of a virialized object in @xmath218 times greater than the mean cosmological density @xmath219 of dm at the time corresponding to redshift @xmath128 .",
    "this provides us with the relations between the radius , velocity dispersion in formed galaxy and galactic mass : @xmath220^{1/3 } , \\quad   \\sigma_e(m)=\\left[\\frac{gm}{r(m , z(m))}\\right]^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath217 is derived from ( [ forcond ] ) . by inverting the function @xmath221 and by using dm fluctuation spectrum ( [ cdm ] )",
    "we find numerically @xmath222 if merging of primordial bhs into the one supermassive central bh proceeds effectively , from this relation we find a resulting mass of the central supermassive bh : @xmath223 where a factor @xmath224 is related with a possible additional growth of the central bh by accretion of dm and baryonic matter .",
    "this model is in a reasonable agreement with observation data ( [ korsig ] ) . the derived power index @xmath225 in relation @xmath226 is closer to one obtained in @xcite .",
    "this power index in our model is completely defined by fluctuation spectrum at the galactic scales or , more definitely , by the value @xmath227 of power index .",
    "a possible dependence of an additional factor @xmath224 on the mass , @xmath110 , could modify a functional relation @xmath228 .",
    "nevertheless , a simple case @xmath229 provides a good agreement of the derived @xmath230 relation with observations ( [ korsig ] ) .",
    "this relation is naturally realized in the model without accretion @xmath231 .",
    "we expect that a minor influence of accretion or universal accretion fraction @xmath229 in the resulting mass of the central supermassive bhs in the galactic centers may be explained in detailed gas dynamics models of galactic nuclei .",
    "it must be noted that @xmath232 correlation is a general feature of stochastic mechanism of supermassive bhs formation and is revealed also in other models of primordial bhs formation , e.  g. @xcite .",
    "we describe here a new model of protogalaxy formation with the cluster of primordial bhs as a source of initial density perturbation .",
    "the used mechanism of primordial bh formation @xcite provide us with a set of primordial bh clusters of different total mass .",
    "this variety of initial conditions leads , therefore , to the variety of protogalaxies from the very beginning of their formation . in this paper",
    "we choose for numerical modeling only those bh clusters which produce the large number of small relatively protogalaxies .",
    "this model predicts the very early galaxy and quasar formation . an other inevitable consequence of this model it the existence of intermediate mass bhs beyond the dynamical centers of galaxies and in the intergalactic medium .",
    "may be one of these type intermediate mass bhs was already observed by the x - ray chandra telescope in the galaxy m82 @xcite .",
    "more definitely in this model the protogalaxies are formed at redshift @xmath2 .",
    "these induced protogalaxies have initially the following parameters : a constituent total mass of dm @xmath233 , a virial radius @xmath194  kpc , a mass of central bh @xmath234 . in the following cosmological and dynamical evolution , these protogalaxies are assembled by hierarchical clustering into the nowadays galaxies .",
    "the clustering process occurs in a stochastic manner and leads to the specific correlation between the central supermassive bh mass and galactic bulge velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "an alternative proposed scenario is based on the initial large primordial bh clusters , when a resulting galaxy contains a single primordial bh growing due to accretion of ambient gas and stars and producing early quasar activity @xcite .",
    "it is worth to estimate in the framework of our model a probability to find a nowadays galaxy without supermassive bh .",
    "induced galaxies ( with a central cluster of primordial bhs ) and ordinary small protogalaxies have mass @xmath235 , while the modern galaxies are much more massive , @xmath236 .",
    "the merging of induced galaxy with an ordinary protogalaxy produces a next generation protogalaxy with the massive central bh .",
    "therefore , about @xmath237 collisions is required to form the nowadays galaxy .",
    "suppose that an amount of induced galaxies is about 0.1% comparing with the ordinary ones . a corresponding probability to find a modern galaxy without supermassive bh is less than @xmath238 .",
