    "nuclei are quantum many - body systems with both bound and unbound states",
    ". a realistic _ ab initio _ approach to light nuclei with predictive power must have the capability to describe both classes of states within a unified framework . over the past 15 years",
    ", significant progress has been made in our understanding of the properties of the bound states of light nuclei starting from realistic nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath6 ) interactions , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein , and more recently also from @xmath6 plus three - nucleon ( @xmath7 ) interactions  @xcite .",
    "however , the calculation of unbound states and nuclear reactions represents a formidable challenge for nuclear theory , the main obstacle being the treatment of the scattering states .",
    "a predictive theory of reactions of light nuclei is needed for many reasons .",
    "first , it would greatly help our understanding of nuclear reactions important for astrophysics .",
    "as an example , the @xmath1be(@xmath0,@xmath8)@xmath3b radiative capture is a step not known accurately enough in the nucleosynthetic chain leading to @xmath3b , which in turn is the dominant source of the high - energy solar neutrinos ( through @xmath9-decay to @xmath3be ) detected in terrestrial experiments .",
    "an even more dramatic example is provided by the @xmath3be(@xmath10,@xmath8)@xmath11c and @xmath11c(@xmath10,@xmath8)@xmath12o radiative capture reactions .",
    "the ratio of the thermonuclear reaction yields for these two processes determines the carbon - to - oxygen ratio at the end of helium burning with important consequences for the production of all species made in subsequent burning stages in the stars . at stellar energies ( @xmath13300 kev )",
    "radiative capture rates are too small to be measured in the laboratory .",
    "thus , measurements are performed at higher energies and extrapolations to the energy region of interest using theory are unavoidable .",
    "the theoretical extrapolation is , however , challenging due to the influence of several resonances .",
    "a fundamental theory would be of great use here .",
    "furthermore , nuclear reactions are one of the best tools for studying exotic nuclei , which have become the focus of the next generation experiments with rare - isotope beams .",
    "these are nuclei for which most low - lying states are unbound , so that a rigorous analysis requires scattering boundary conditions .",
    "in addition , much of the information we have on the structure of these short - lived systems is inferred from reactions with other nuclei .",
    "finally , low - energy fusion reactions represent the primary energy - generation mechanism in stars , and could potentially be used for future energy generation on earth .",
    "examples of these latter reactions include the @xmath4+@xmath5h@xmath14+@xmath15he fusion used at iter and at the national ignition facility ( nif ) .",
    "even though there have been many experimental investigations of the cross sections of this reaction , there are still open issues .",
    "a first - principles theory will provide the predictive power to reduce the uncertainty in the reaction rate at very low temperatures ; provide an understanding of the reaction rate dependence on the polarization induced by the strong magnetic fields ( characteristic of both inertial and magnetic confinement ) ; and clarify the influence of non - local thermal equilibrium in plasma environments .    in this contribution , we present a brief overview of the field in sect .",

    "because of their importance nuclear reactions attract much attention , and there have been many interesting new developments in the recent past . in this section",
    "we will give a brief and non - exhaustive overview of the theoretical efforts devoted to microscopic approaches to nuclear reactions , and in particular scattering of light nuclei .    by microscopic approaches",
    "we mean methods , in which all the nucleons involved in the process are treated as active degrees of freedom , and the antisymmetrization of the many - body wave functions is treated exactly .",
    "if the @xmath6 interactions among all participating nucleons are realistic , i.e. , describe accurately @xmath6 scattering and the deuteron , we call the calculation _",
    "ab initio_.    in the three- and four - nucleon sectors there has been remarkable progress over the past decade : the faddeev  @xcite , faddeev - yakubovski ( fy )  @xcite , alt - grassberger and sandhas ( ags )  @xcite , hyperspherical harmonics ( hh )  @xcite , lorentz integral transform methods  @xcite , rgm  @xcite , etc .",
    ", are among the best known of several numerically exact techniques able to describe reactions observables starting from realistic @xmath6 and in some cases also @xmath7 forces .    going beyond four nucleons",
    "there are fewer _ ab initio _ or _ ab initio _ inspired methods able to describe reactions observables starting from realistic forces . only very recently the green s function monte carlo ( gfmc )  @xcite , the no - core shell model combined with the resonating group method ( ncsm / rgm )  @xcite and the fermionic molecular dynamics  @xcite have made steps in this direction .",
    "reactions among light nuclei are more widely described starting from semi - realistic @xmath6 interactions with adjusted parameters within the traditional resonating - group method  @xcite or the generator coordinate method  @xcite , which are microscopic cluster techniques . in these approaches ,",
    "the @xmath6 interactions are often simplified to central forces and the cluster wave functions are not necessarily eigenstates obtained with the same interaction as that used between nucleons from different clusters .    among the recent developments in the @xmath17 scattering and reaction calculations we highlight the new capability to include properly the coulomb interaction in momentum space  @xcite and to include the three - nucleon interaction in the @xmath0-@xmath5h faddeev - yakubovski configuration space calculations  @xcite .",
    "a benchmark for the @xmath2-@xmath5h low - energy elastic cross section calculation has been performed by the fy , ags and hh methods using different @xmath6 potentials  @xcite .",
    "the main conclusion of this work is the failure of the existing @xmath6 forces to reproduce the @xmath2-@xmath5h total cross section .",
    "remarkable recent results are the @xmath0-@xmath5he scattering calculations performed using the hyperspherical harmonic basis , which demonstrated that the new @xmath6 plus @xmath7 interactions derived within chiral effective field theory ( eft ) reduce noticeably the discrepancy observed for the @xmath18 observable  @xcite .",
    "further , with the same hamiltonian , the low - energy total @xmath2-@xmath5h cross section calculated by the hh method was found in improved agreement with the data  @xcite .",
    "the first _ ab initio _ scattering calculation for a system with @xmath19 was performed within the gfmc approach .",
    "the @xmath2-@xmath10 low - lying @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xmath22-wave resonances as well as the @xmath23 @xmath24-wave non - resonant scattering below 5 mev center of mass ( c.m . )",
    "energy were obtained using the av18 @xmath6 potential with and without the three - nucleon force , chosen to be either the urbana ix or the illinois-2 model  @xcite .",
    "the results of these calculations revealed sensitivity to the inter - nucleon interaction , and in particular to the strength of the spin - orbit force .    as an interesting theoretical development to the many - body scattering ,",
    "we mention the approach based on the variational description of continuum states in terms of integral relations  @xcite that may be used to directly apply the bound - state many - body techniques to scattering .",
    "a variation of this approach has been explored in the @xmath25 scattering in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there are also some recent attempts to describe the nuclear scattering in an effective field theory approach .",
    "in particular , the pion - less eft combined with the rgm was successfully applied to three- and four - nucleon bound state and scattering calculations  @xcite .    in a big jump in mass number",
    ", we note that the @xmath26f low - lying states were recently investigated within the coupled - cluster approach with the gamow - hartree - fock basis that incorporates effects of the continuum  @xcite .",
    "the calculation resulted in a good description of the @xmath23 proton halo state in @xmath26f .",
    "it was shown that the continuum effects are essential to obtain these results and that the proton halo state single - particle energy is not affected by short - range correlations in the nuclear interactions .",
    "we have developed a new many - body approach , the _ ab initio _",
    "ncsm / rgm  @xcite , capable of simultaneously describing both bound and scattering states in light nuclei throughout the @xmath0-shell , thus , filling the gap between the @xmath17 and the @xmath27 systems .",
    "the ncsm  @xcite is an approach to the microscopic calculation of ground and low - lying excited states of light nuclei with realistic two- and , in general , three - nucleon forces .",
    "the rgm  @xcite is a microscopic cluster technique based on the use of @xmath28-nucleon hamiltonians , with fully anti - symmetric many - body wave functions built assuming that the nucleons are grouped into clusters .",
    "although most of its applications are based on the use of binary - cluster wave functions , the rgm can be formulated for three ( and , in principle , even more ) clusters . the use of the harmonic oscillator ( ho ) basis in the ncsm results in an incorrect description of the wave - function asymptotic and a lack of coupling to the continuum . by combining the ncsm with the rgm , we complement the ability of the rgm to deal with scattering and reactions with the utilization of realistic interactions and a consistent microscopic description of the nucleonic clusters achieved via _ ab initio _ ncsm , while preserving important symmetries such as pauli exclusion principle , translational invariance , and angular momentum .    here , we limit ourselves to a two - cluster rgm , which is based on binary - cluster channel states of total angular momentum @xmath29 , parity @xmath30 , and isospin @xmath31 , @xmath32^{(j^\\pi t)}\\,\\frac{\\delta(r - r_{a - a , a})}{rr_{a - a , a}}\\,.\\label{basis}\\ ] ] in the above expression , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the internal ( antisymmetric ) wave functions of the first and second cluster , containing @xmath35 and @xmath36 nucleons ( @xmath37 ) , respectively .",

    "the relative coordinate @xmath41 represents the separation of the cluster centers of mass .",
    "the channel states  ( [ basis ] ) have relative angular momentum @xmath42 .",
    "it is convenient to group all relevant quantum numbers into a cumulative index @xmath43 .",
    "the former basis states can be used to expand the many - body wave function according to @xmath44 as the basis states  ( [ basis ] ) are not anti - symmetric under exchange of nucleons belonging to different clusters , in order to preserve the pauli principle one has to introduce the appropriate inter - cluster antisymmetrizer @xmath45 .",
    "the coefficients of the expansion  ( [ trial ] ) are the relative - motion wave functions @xmath46 , which represent the only unknowns of the problem . to determine them one has to solve the non - local integro - differential coupled - channel equations @xmath47",

    "we have used @xmath50 and @xmath51 to denote the total energy in the center - of - mass frame and the intrinsic @xmath28-nucleon microscopic hamiltonian , respectively .",
    "the formalism presented above is combined with the _ ab initio _ ncsm in two steps .",
    "first , the cluster eigenstates appearing in eq .",

    "( [ h - kernel ] ) . an ho basis truncated by the maximum number of the ho excitations @xmath52 above the unperturbed ground state is used .",
    "second , we replace the delta functions in the localized parts of the hamiltonian  ( [ h - kernel ] ) and the norm  ( [ n - kernel ] ) kernels with their representation in the ho model space .",
    "we use the same ho frequency ( @xmath53 ) as for the cluster eigenstate wave functions and a consistent model - space size ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "we emphasize that this replacement is performed only for the localized parts of the kernels .",
    "the diagonal parts coming from the identity operator in the antisymmetrizers , the kinetic term and the average coulomb potential are treated exactly .",
    "an advantage of the ho basis is its flexibility . in particular ,",
    "if the @xmath54 truncation is used , one may utilize the slater - determinant ( sd ) single - particle ho basis and still preserve the translational invariance ( for a translationally invariant hamiltonian or other operator ) .",
    "one can even combine the sd basis and the relative - coordinate ( jacobi ) basis .",
    "this is what we do in the ncsm / rgm applications to @xmath0-shell nuclei .",
    "we use the sd basis for the target ( heavier cluster with mass number @xmath55 ) and the jacobi basis for the projectile ( mass number @xmath36 ) . the translationally invariant kernels ( [ h - kernel ] ) and ( [ n - kernel ] )",
    "can then be recovered by a transformation as described in ref .",
    "the use of the sd basis allows us to utilize all the shell - model techniques and codes .    in this contribution",
    ", we employ similarity - renormalization - group ( srg )  @xcite evolved chiral n@xmath5lo @xmath6 potentials  @xcite ( srg - n@xmath5lo ) that are soft enough to allow us to reach convergence within about @xmath56 ho excitations in the basis expansion .",
    "the srg evolution characterized by a parameter @xmath57 corresponds to a unitary transformation that transforms away off - diagonal @xmath6 matrix elements in the momentum - space basis .",
    "the evolved @xmath6 potential is phase - shift equivalent to the initial @xmath6 potential .    to guarantee the convergence of the ncsm / rgm calculation with respect to the ho basis expansion of both the cluster wave functions and the localized rgm integration kernels , we need to use a large @xmath52 value . at present",
    ", we are able to perform calculations up to @xmath58 for nuclei with @xmath59 ( with @xmath6 interactions ) . however , the use of large @xmath60 values is now feasible even for heavier nuclei thanks to the recent introduction of the importance truncated ( it ) ncsm scheme  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that many of the basis states used in the ncsm calculations are irrelevant for the description of any particular eigenstate , e.g. , the ground state or a set of low - lying states .",
    "therefore , if one were able to identify the important basis states beforehand , one could reduce the dimension of the matrix eigenvalue problem without losing predictive power .",
    "this can be done using an importance truncation scheme based on many - body perturbation theory  @xcite .",

    "the @xmath70 resonance is positioned at higher energy in the calculation and the corresponding phase shifts are underestimated with respect to the experimental results , although the disagreement becomes less and less pronounced starting at about 8 mev .",
