    "most previous studies computing torsional shear modes of the stellar crust assume free slip over the fluid core .",
    "but if the strong magnetic field couples crust and core together then one should instead consider global magneto - elastic perturbations .",
    "recent work on the coupled problem , however , suggests that the vibrations most likely to be observed have very similar frequencies to those computed in the uncoupled problem @xcite .",
    "the natural crust frequencies are therefore physically relevant , so for simplicity we neglect coupling and apply zero traction boundary conditions @xcite .    following @xcite we use a plane - parallel geometry with constant gravitational acceleration @xmath10 in the vertical direction @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 being the mass and radius star .",
    "the newtonian equations of hydrostatic equilibrium determine the crust density profile .",
    "using a slab rather than spherical geometry allows us to incorporate the magnetic field without difficulty ; we assume a constant field @xmath14 .",

    "the scaling with @xmath4 differs from that used by @xcite but gives better agreement between slab and spherical models in the zero field limit @xcite .",
    "the shear modulus @xmath17 @xcite is    @xmath23    here @xmath24 is the atomic number of the ions , @xmath25 the density of ions and @xmath26 the average inter - ion spacing .",

    "crust temperature in the tail of a giant flare is not well constrained : observations set a lower limit of @xmath30 k @xcite , but theory suggests that it could be as high as @xmath31 k @xcite , so we examine the range @xmath32 k.    we consider stellar models with @xmath33 and @xmath34 km , subject to causality constraints , to cover the full range of possible strange star parameter space @xcite .",
    "both thin nuclear and nugget crust models are studied @xcite we model magnetic fields in the range @xmath35 g. the strong field affects only the very outermost low density layers of the crust @xcite : we estimate the corrections to computed mode frequencies to be less than 1% .",
    "energetic arguments show that global crust structure , including the suspended crust model , is unaffected .    for the thin nuclear crust",
    "there is some uncertainty in the composition of neutron - rich nuclei , which will be constrained by future rare isotope experiments .",
    "we therefore survey a range of equations of state @xcite .",
    "the nugget crust is composed of a lattice of strange quark nuggets embedded in a background degenerate electron gas .",
    "the electrons contribute to the pressure , and the nuggets to the energy density .",
    "the density within the crust is given by @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the energy density of quark matter inside nuggets and depends on the density @xmath38 @xmath39 and chemical potential @xmath40 300 mev at which stable quark matter vanishes .",

    "the quark matter parameters are poorly known and can only be determined within the context of specific models . in the bag model , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "further , requiring sqm to be absolutely stable and simultaneously requiring normal nuclei to be metastable restricts @xmath48 to a narrow range centered around @xmath49 mev .",
    "thus within the bag model , the remaining uncertainty is parametrized through the effective strange quark mass @xmath50 which we expect to be in the range @xmath51 mev .",
    "the spherical nugget phase occupies most of the crust ; we will neglect the small region at the base of the crust containing the pasta phase ( see below ) . in computing shear modulus ( eqn .",

    "in reality the region with @xmath64 that contains the pasta phase occupies a tiny region with thickness @xmath65 m .",
    "further , with increasing @xmath41 the free energy gain of the heterogeneous state becomes negligible and even a small surface tension can disfavor the large @xmath41 region .",
    "for these reasons we set @xmath66 at the base of the crust .",

    "for neutron star models torsional shear modes , or their global magneto - elastic equivalents , are a good fit for the observations . for strange stars ,",
    "the situation is much more difficult .",
    "a thin nuclear crust model can give a fundamental in the right range if stellar mass is large , but the overtone frequencies are far too high .",
    "the nugget crust model permits a wider range of frequencies due to the uncertainty in the strange quark mass @xmath50 .",
    "the lowest order @xmath3 modes could explain some of the qpos in the range 18 - 150 hz , but because the fundamental frequencies are so low it is difficult to fit a mode sequence , given the expected scaling with @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "for the radial overtones there are regions of parameter space at high temperature with modes at the right frequency , but only for magnetic fields at least an order of magnitude lower than those inferred for magnetars . at magnetar field strengths",
    "only models at the very limits of parameter space permit an overtone frequency as low as 625 hz .",
    "the other constraint on the nugget crust is the sensitivity of the overtones to temperature fluctuations ( greater for this model than for the thin nuclear crust or neutron star crusts ) .",
    "the observations indicate that the 625 hz qpo has high coherence and lasts for several hundred seconds , a period during which temperature could vary substantially @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the frequencies of toroidal shear modes in strange star crusts have serious difficulty explaining the qpo frequencies observed during magnetar hyperflares .",
    "if the results of @xcite and @xcite hold true , this conclusion will not change greatly when coupling to core is included in the calculation .",
    "however , these results must now be verified using more sophisticated models that include a realistic stellar geometry , field configuration , and general relativistic corrections .",
    "there may also be other types of modes in the right frequency range @xcite , although these should be harder to excite and detect .",
    "we note that there are alternative non - seismic models for the qpos , but that these models have serious difficulties ( for a discussion see @xcite ) .",
    "the clear distinction between the theoretical predictions for neutron star and strange star crust models is extremely promising .",
    "it offers a robust , largely model independent means of distinguishing strange stars from neutron stars , something that has in the past been lacking .",
    "this type of study should lead to rapid progress in constraining the equation of state of compact stars .",
    "ruling out the strange star hypothesis would directly impact the phase diagram of qcd at finite chemical potential .",
    "it would offer a strong constraint on models of dense quark matter , indicating that the deconfinement transition is not significantly lowered by the dynamics of the strange quarks .",
    "one important implication is that multiply strange hadronic states such as the h - dibaryon in the terrestrial context are less likely .",
    "in addition , constraints on the models at finite chemical potential should be relevant for finite temperature extensions of these models which have been employed to describe heavy - ion experiments such as the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) .",
    "perhaps most importantly , ruling out strange stars directly from observations is the only way to ascertain that terrestrial matter is stable .",
