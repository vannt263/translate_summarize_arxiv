    "it was advocated in ref .  @xcite that the cross section for @xmath0 production at high energy may be very large due to double parton scattering ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "the lhcb collaboration measured the cross section for the production of @xmath6 pairs at @xmath7 = 7 tev which is surprisingly large @xcite .",
    "some interesting differential studies were performed there .",
    "somewhat later two of us discussed several differential distributions for double charm production in the @xmath8-factorization approach using unintegrated gluon distributions @xcite and found several observables useful to identify the dps effects .",
    "so far the single parton scattering contribution to @xmath0 was calculated only in high - energy approximation @xcite . for kinematical reasons",
    "the approximation should be reasonable for large rapidity distances .",
    "in real experiments the condition of large rapidity distances is not always fulfilled .",
    "the double scattering effects were studied in several other processes such as four jet production @xcite , production of @xmath9 pairs @xcite , production of four charged leptons @xcite . in all the cases the dps contributions are much smaller than the sps contributions .",
    "the production of double hidden charm was studied e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath10 process . there",
    "the sps and dps contributions are comparable .",
    "the dps contribution exceeds the sps contribution for large rapidity distance between the two @xmath11 s .",
    "this is similar for @xmath0 production @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present study is to make a detailed comparison of the dps and sps with full ( exact ) matrix element .",
    "the results presented here are obtained with a code which automatically generates matrix element . in the present study",
    "we include only @xmath2 subprocess which is sufficient at high energies .",
    "we intend to make a detailed comparison of the present sps results to the results obtained in the high - energy approximation @xcite .",
    "finally our results will be compared to recent lhcb data @xcite .",
    "in leading - order collinear approximation the differential distributions for @xmath12 production depend e.g. on the rapidity of the quark , the rapidity of the antiquark and the transverse momentum of one of them ( they are identical ) @xcite . in the next - to - leading order ( nlo )",
    "collinear approach or in the @xmath8-factorization approach the situation is more complicated as there are more kinematical variables necessary to describe the kinematical situation . in the @xmath8-factorization approach the differential cross section for dps production of @xmath0 system , assuming factorization of the dpsmodel , can be written as : @xmath13    when integrating over kinematical variables one obtains @xmath14 these formulae assume that the two parton subprocesses are not correlated .",
