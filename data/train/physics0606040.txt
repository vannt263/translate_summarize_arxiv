    "recently , internet trading has become very popular .",
    "obviously , the rate ( or price ) change of the trading behaves according to some unknown stochastic processes , and numerous studies have been conducted to reveal the statistical properties of its nonlinear dynamics @xcite .",
    "in fact , several authors have analysed tick - by - tick data of price changes including the currency exchange rate in financial markets @xcite .",
    "some of these studies are restricted to the stochastic variables of price changes ( returns ) and most of them are specified by terms such as the _ fat _ or _ heavy tails _ of distributions @xcite .",
    "however , fluctuation in time intervals , namely , the duration in the point process @xcite might also contain important market information , and it is worthwhile to investigate these properties .",
    "such fluctuations in the time intervals between events are not unique to price changes in financial markets but are also very common in the real world . in fact",
    ", it is wellknown that the spike train of a single neuron in the human brain is regarded as a time series , wherein the difference between two successive spikes is not constant but fluctuates .",
    "the stochastic process specified by the so - called inter - spike intervals ( isi ) is one such example @xcite .",
    "the average isi is of the order of a few milli - second and the distribution of the intervals is well - described by a _",
    "gamma distribution _ @xcite .    on the other hand , in financial markets , for instance , the time interval between two consecutive transactions of bund futures ( bund is the german word for bond ) and btp futures ( btps are middle- and long - term italian government bonds with fixed interest rates ) traded at london international financial futures and options exchange ( liffe ) is @xmath0 seconds and is well - fitted by the _ mittag - leffler function _ @xcite .",
    "the mittag - leffler function behaves as a stretched exponential distribution for short time - interval regimes , whereas for the long time - interval regimes , the function has a power - law tail .",
    "thus , the behaviour of the distribution described by the mittag - leffler function changes from the stretched exponential to the power - law at some critical point @xcite .",
    "however , it is nontrivial to determine whether the mittag - leffler function supports any other kind of market data , e.g. the market data filtered by a rate window .",
    "similar to the stochastic processes of price change in financial markets , the us dollar / japanese yen ( usd / jpy ) exchange rate of sony bank @xcite , which is an internet - based bank , reproduces its rate by using a _ rate window _ with a width of @xmath1 yen for its individual customers in japan .",
    "that is , if the usd / jpy market rate changes by more than @xmath1 yen , the usd / jpy sony bank rate is updated to the market rate . in this sense , it is possible for us to say that the procedure of determination of the sony bank usd / jpy exchange rate is essentially a first - passage process @xcite .    in this paper , we analyse the average time interval that a customer must wait until the next price ( rate ) change after they log in to their computer systems .",
    "empirical data analysis has shown that the average time interval between rate changes is one of the most important statistics for understanding market behaviour . however , as internet trading becomes popular , customers would be more interested in the average waiting time  defined as the average time that customers have to wait between any instant and the next price change  when they want to observe the rate , e.g. when they log in to their computer systems rather than the average time interval between rate changes . to evaluate the average waiting time",
    ", we use the so - called renewal - reward theorem which is wellknown in the field of queueing theory @xcite . in addition , we provide a simple formula to evaluate the expected reward for customers . in particular , we investigate these important quantities for the sony bank usd / jpy exchange rate by analysing a simple probabilistic model and computer simulations that are based on the _ arch ( autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity ) _ @xcite and _ garch ( generalised arch ) _",
    "@xcite stochastic models with the assistance of empirical data analysis of the sony bank rate @xcite .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we explain the method being used by the sony bank and introduce several studies concerning empirical data about the rate . in sec .",
    "iii , we introduce a general formula to evaluate average waiting time using the renewal - reward theorem and calculate it with regard to sony bank customers .",
    "recently , one of the authors @xcite provided evidence implying that the first - passage time ( fpt ) distribution of the sony bank rate obeys the _ weibull distribution _",
    "this conjecture is regarded as a counter part of studies that suggest that the fpt should follow an exponential distribution ( see example in @xcite ) . in the same section",
    ", we evaluate the average waiting time while assuming that fpt obeys an exponential distribution .",
    "next , we compare it with the result for the weibull distribution and perform empirical data analyses @xcite .",
    "we find that the assumption of exponential distributions on the first - passage process should be rejected and that a weibull distribution seems more suitable for explaining the first - passage processes of the sony bank rate .",
    "thus , we can predict how long customers wait and how many returns they obtain until the next rate change after they log in to their computer systems . in sec .",
    "iv , to investigate the effects of the rate window of the sony bank , we introduce the arch and garch models to reproduce the raw data before filtering it through the rate window . in sec .",
    "v , we evaluate the reward that customers can expect to obtain after they log in to their computer systems .",
    "the last section provides a summary and discussion .",
    "the sony bank rate @xcite is the foreign exchange rate that the sony bank offers with reference to the market rate and not their customers orders . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sazuka3000 ] , we show a typical update of the sony bank rate .        if the usd / jpy market rate changes by greater than or equal to @xmath1 yen , the sony bank usd / jpy rate is updated to the market rate . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fg_window ] , we show the method of generating the sony bank rate from the market rate .     in time ( shaded area ) from the market rate ( solid line ) .",
    "the units of the horizontal and the vertical axes are ticks and yen , respectively.,width=377 ]    in this sense , the sony bank rate can be regarded as a kind of first - passage processes . in table [",
    "tab : table1 ] , we show data concerning the sony bank usd / jpy rate vs. tick - by - tick data for the usd / jpy rate from bloomberg l.p .",
    ".[tab : table1 ] the sony bank usd / jpy rate vs. tick - by - tick data for the usd / jpy rate @xcite . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from these tables and figures , an important question might arise .",
    "namely ; how long should sony bank customers wait between observing the price and the next price change ?",
    "this type of question never arises in the case of isi or bund futures , because the average time intervals are too short to evaluate such measures .",
    "we would like to stress that in this paper , we do not discuss the market data underlying the sony bank rate ; however , as we will see in the following sections , the main result obtained in this study , i.e. how long a trader must wait for the next price change of the sony bank rate from the time she or he logs on to the internet , is not affected by this lack of information .",
    "from table [ tab : table1 ] , we find that the number of data per day is remarkably reduced from @xmath2 to @xmath3 because of an effect of the rate window of @xmath1-yen width . as a result , the average interval of exchange rate updates is extended to @xmath4 min .",
    "this quantity is one of the most important measures for the market , however , customers might seek information about the _ average waiting time _ , which is defined as the average time interval that customers have to wait until the next change of the sony bank usd / jpy rate after they log in to their computer systems . to evaluate the average waiting time",
    ", we use the _ renewal - reward theorem _ , which is wellknown in the field of queueing theory @xcite .",
    "we briefly explain the theorem below .",
    "let us define @xmath5 as the number of rate changes within the interval @xmath6 $ ] and suppose that a customer logs in to her / his computer system at time @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "then , we defined the following quantity : @xmath9 which denotes the waiting time for the customer until the next update of the sony bank usd / jpy rates when she or he logs in to a computer system at time @xmath7 .",
    "then , the renewal - reward theorem @xcite implies that the average waiting time @xmath10 can be written in terms of the first two moments , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , of the first - passage time distribution @xmath13 as @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , if we obtain the explicit form of the fpt distribution @xmath13 , we can evaluate the average waiting time @xmath10 by using this theorem ( [ eq : rr ] ) .",
    "the proof of the theorem is quite simple .",
    "let us suppose that the points at which the sony bank usd / jpy rate changes are given by the time sequence @xmath17 . for these data points ,",
    "the first - passage time series is given by definition as @xmath18 .",
    "then , we observe that the time integral @xmath19 appearing in equation ( [ eq : rr ] ) is identical to @xmath20 , where @xmath21 corresponds to the area of a triangle with sides @xmath22 and @xmath23 . as a result",
    ", we obtain @xmath24 wherein we used the fact that the expectation of the waiting time @xmath25 is given by @xmath26 therefore , @xmath27 thus , equation ( [ eq : rr ] ) holds true .    therefore , if we obtain the explicit form of the first - passage time distribution @xmath13 , the average waiting time @xmath10 can be evaluated by theorem ( [ eq : rr ] ) . however , for estimating the distribution @xmath13 , we can only perform empirical data analysis of the sony bank rate .",
    "apparently , the first - passage process of the sony bank rate depends on the stochastic processes of raw market data underlying the data that is available on the website for customers after being filtered by a rate window of @xmath1-yen width . unfortunately , this raw data is not available to us and we can not use any information regarding the high - frequency raw data .    recently ,",
    "an empirical data analysis by one of the authors of this paper @xcite revealed that the weibull probability distribution function , which is defined by @xmath28 is a good approximation of the sony bank usd / jpy rate in the non - asymptotic regime .",
    "we should keep in mind that in the asymptotic regime , the fpt distribution obeys the power - law  @xmath29  and a crossover takes place at the intermediate time scale @xmath30 [ s ] .",
    "however , the percentage of empirical data for the power - law regime is only @xmath31 .",
    "similar behaviour was observed for the time - interval distribution between two consecutive transactions of bund futures traded at liffe , and the time - interval distribution is well - described by the mittag - leffler type function @xcite , namely , the distribution changes from the stretched exponential to the power - law for long - time regimes .",
    "therefore , we have chosen a weibull distribution in both asymptotic and non - asymptotic regimes to evaluate the average waiting time .",
    "the justification for this choice will be discussed later by comparing the predicted value with the result from empirical data analysis .",
    "this weibull distribution ( [ eq : weibull ] ) is reduced to an exponential distribution for @xmath32 and a rayleigh distribution for @xmath33 .",
    "it is easy for us to evaluate the first two moments of the distribution @xmath34 .",
    "we obtained them explicitly as @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "thus , the average waiting time @xmath10 for the weibull distribution is explicitly given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 refers to the gamma function , and @xmath39 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fg2 ] we plot the average waiting time @xmath10 ( [ eq : w_weibull ] ) as a function of @xmath40 for several values of @xmath41 , and we find that @xmath10 for sony bank customers is convenient and reasonable .",
    "this is because the empirical data analysis reported the value of the parameter as @xmath42 , and the average waiting time @xmath10 for this case is evaluated as @xmath43 }   = 42.236 $ ] [ min ] from the inset of this figure . from reference @xcite , information about the scaling parameter @xmath41",
    "was not available ; however , we can easily obtain the value as discussed next .    as mentioned above",
    ", several empirical data analyses @xcite revealed that parameter @xmath44 for the sony bank rate .",
    "in fact , it is possible for us to estimate @xmath41 by using the fact that the average interval @xmath45 of the rate change is @xmath4 [ min ] ( table [ tab : table1 ] ) .",
    "next , we obtain the following simple relation : @xmath46 that is @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , @xmath48 substituting @xmath44 and @xmath49 [ s ] , we obtain the parameter @xmath41 for the sony bank rate as @xmath50 .",
    "it should be noted that the average waiting time is also evaluated by a simple sampling from the empirical data of the sony bank rates .",
    "the first two moments of the first - passage time distribution @xmath34  @xmath51  are easily calculated from the sampling , and then , the average waiting time is given by @xmath52 .",
    "we find that @xmath53 [ min ] which is not much different from that obtained by evaluation ( @xmath54 [ min ] ) by means of the renewal - reward theorem ( [ eq : rr ] ) .",
    "thus , the renewal - reward theorem introduced here determines the average waiting time of the financial system with adequate accuracy , and our assumption of the weibull distribution for the first - passage time of the sony bank rates seems to be reasonable .",
    "we would particularly like to stress that the @xmath55 data from the asymptotic regime does not contribute much to the average waiting time .",
    "a detailed account of this fine agreement between @xmath10 and @xmath56 , more precisely , the factors to which we can attribute the small difference between @xmath10 and @xmath56 , will be reported in our forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "we would now like to discuss the average waiting time for the case in which the first - passage process can be regarded as a poisson process . in the poisson process",
    ", the number of events occurring in the interval @xmath6 $ ] is given by @xmath57@xmath58 .",
    "for this poisson process , the time interval @xmath59 between two arbitrary successive events obeys the following exponential distribution : @xmath60 then , we obtain the first two moments of the above distribution @xmath13 as @xmath61 .",
    "these two moments give the average waiting time for the poisson process as @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , for the poisson process , the average waiting time @xmath10 is identical to the average rate interval @xmath11 . this result might be naturally accepted because the login - time dependence on the average waiting time is averaged out due to the fact that for a poisson process , each event takes place independently . on the other hand , for a non - poisson process , the login time is essential to determine the average waiting time .",
    "thus , the average waiting time becomes @xmath63 instead of @xmath11 .",
    "we should stress that for a given stochastic process whose fpt is a constant @xmath64 , the average waiting time @xmath10 is easily evaluated by @xmath65 .",
    "however , the result for the above poisson process implies that for a poisson process with a mean @xmath11 of the fpt , the average waiting time is not @xmath66 but @xmath11 .",
    "this fact is referred to as the _ inspection paradox _",
    "@xcite in the field of queueing theory . for a poisson process",
    ", each event occurs independently , but the time interval between the events follows an exponential distribution .",
    "therefore , there is some opportunity for the customers to log in to their computer systems when the exchange rate remains the same for a relatively long time , although the short fpt occurs with higher frequency than the long fpt .",
    "this fact makes @xmath10 the first moment @xmath11 of the fpt distribution .    on the other hand , for the weibull distribution ,",
    "the condition under which the average waiting time @xmath10 is the same as the average first - passage time @xmath11 is given by @xmath67 , i.e. @xmath68    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fg4 ] , we plot both curves @xmath69 and @xmath70 , as functions of @xmath40 .",
    "the crossing point @xmath71 corresponds to the weibull parameter for which the average waiting time @xmath10 is identical to the average first - passage time @xmath11 . obviously , for the parameter regime @xmath72 ( the case of sony bank ) , the average waiting time evaluated by the renewal - reward theorem becomes longer than the average first - passage time @xmath11 . as mentioned before",
    ", the weibull distribution with @xmath32 follows the exponential distribution @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , as mentioned in the case of the poisson process , the login - time dependence of the customers is averaged out in the calculation of the average waiting time @xmath10 . as the result",
    ", @xmath10 becomes the first moment of the fpt distribution , @xmath11 .",
    "however , once the parameter of the weibull distribution has deviated from @xmath74 , the cumulative distribution is no longer an exponential distribution .",
    "thus , the stochastic process is not described by a poisson process and the average waiting time @xmath10 is not @xmath11 but @xmath75 which is derived from the renewal - reward theorem .",
    "as mentioned above , the empirical data analysis revealed that the average waiting time of sony bank rates is @xmath76 [ min ] .",
    "this value is almost twice of the average interval of the rate change data @xmath77 [ min ] in table [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "this fact is a kind of justification or evidence for the conclusion that the sony bank usd / jpy exchange rate obeys non - exponential distribution from the viewpoint of the renewal - reward theorem .",
    "in the previous sections , we evaluated the average waiting time @xmath10 for foreign exchange rates ( price change ) .",
    "in particular , we focused on the average waiting time of the sony bank rate whose fpt distribution might be represented by a weibull distribution .",
    "we compared the average waiting time @xmath10 obtained by the renewal - reward theorem with that obtained by a simple sampling of the empirical data of the sony bank rate and found a good agreement between the two .",
    "however , as mentioned earlier , the empirical data of sony bank was obtained by filtering the raw market data using a rate window of @xmath1-yen width .",
    "unfortunately , the raw data of the real market is not available to us ( sony bank does not keep these records ) and the only information we could obtain is the sony bank rate itself . although the main result of the evaluation of the average waiting time is never affected by this lack of information , it might be worthwhile to investigate the role of the rate window with the assistance of computer simulations .    for this purpose",
    ", we introduce the stochastic process @xmath78 , where the time intervals of two successive time stamps @xmath79 obey a weibull distribution specified by the two parameters @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "for example , for the ordinary wiener process , the above stochastic process is described by @xmath82 where @xmath83 denotes the value of price at time @xmath59 .",
    "obviously , the first - passage time of the above stochastic process has a distribution @xmath13 , which is generally different from @xmath84 .",
    "nevertheless , here we assume that @xmath13 also obeys a weibull distribution with parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "next , we investigate the effect of a rate window with a width of @xmath85 through the difference of the parameters , namely , the @xmath40-@xmath80 and @xmath41-@xmath81 plots . for simplicity",
    ", we set @xmath86 in our computer simulations .",
    "in other words , using computer simulations , we clarify the relationship between the _ input _ @xmath80 and the corresponding _ output _",
    "@xmath40 of the filter with a rate window of width @xmath85 .      to determine the output @xmath40 from the histogram of first - passage time , we use the _ weibull paper analysis _",
    "@xcite for cumulative distribution .",
    "now , we briefly explain the details of the method .",
    "we first consider the cumulative distribution of the weibull distributions with @xmath87 as @xmath88 then , for the histogram of the cumulative distribution obtained by sampling using computer simulations , we fit the histogram to the weibull distribution by using the following _ weibull paper _ : @xmath89 thus , the parameter @xmath40 of the first - passage time distribution @xmath13 is obtained as a slope of the @xmath90-@xmath91 plot . in the following subsection , we evaluate the parameter @xmath40 of the fpt distribution for the stochastic processes with time intervals of two successive time stamps @xmath92 obeying the weibull distribution @xmath84 .",
    "then , we compare @xmath80 with @xmath40 using the above weibull paper analysis ( [ eq : weibullp ] ) .      as stochastic model of the raw data of the real market ,",
    "the wiener process defined by equations ( [ eq : wiener2 ] ) and ( [ eq : weibull_m0 ] ) is one of the simplest candidates .",
    "however , numerous studies from both empirical and theoretical viewpoints have revealed that the volatility of financial data such as the usd / jpy exchange rate is a time - dependent stochastic variable . with this fact in mind ,",
    "we introduce two types of stochastic processes that are characterised by time - dependent volatility  _ arch _ @xcite and _ garch _ models @xcite .",
    "the arch(1 ) model used in this section is described as follows : @xmath93 where we assume that the time interval @xmath92 obeys the weibull distribution ( [ eq : weibull_m0 ] ) . from the definition in ( [ eq : arch1 ] ) and ( [ eq : arch2 ] ) , we find that the volatility @xmath94 controlling the conditional probability density @xmath95 at time @xmath59 fluctuates . however , for the limit @xmath96 , such a _ local time dependence _ does not prevent the stochastic process from having a well - defined asymptotic distribution @xmath97 .",
    "in fact , the above arch(1 ) model is characterised by the variance @xmath98 observed over a long time interval @xmath96 .",
    "it is easily shown that @xmath98 can be written in terms of @xmath99 and @xmath100 as @xmath101 we choose the parameters @xmath99 and @xmath100 so as to satisfy @xmath102 . as a possible choice for this requirement , we select @xmath103 . for this parameter choice ,",
    "the _ kurtosis _",
    "( @xmath104 ) , which is defined by the second and fourth moments of the probability distribution function of the stochastic variable @xmath105 as @xmath106 , leads to @xmath107 as is well - known , the higher kurtosis values of financial data indicate that the values close to the mean and extreme positive and negative outliers appear more frequently than for normally distributed variables . in other words ,",
    "the kurtosis is a measure of the fatness of the tails of the distribution .",
    "for instance , a normal gaussian distribution has @xmath108 , whereas distributions with @xmath109 are referred to as _",
    "leptokurtic _ and have tails fatter than a gaussian distribution .",
    "the kurtosis of the arch(1 ) model with @xmath103 is @xmath110 .    here",
    ", we also introduce the garch(1,1 ) model defined as @xmath111 where the time interval @xmath92 is assumed to obey the weibull distribution ( [ eq : weibull_m0 ] ) .",
    "the variance of the above garch(1,1 ) model observed on a long time interval , @xmath96 , is given by @xmath112 to compare the effect of the rate window for the arch(1 ) model with that of the garch(1,1 ) model , we choose the parameters @xmath113 and @xmath114 so as to satisfy @xmath102 . among many candidates , we select @xmath115 , which gives the kurtosis @xmath116    in fig .

    "therefore , below the line @xmath119 , the rate window affects the stochastic process so as to decrease the parameter @xmath80 of the weibull distribution , whereas , above this line , the parameter @xmath80 increases to @xmath121 .",

    "the reward rate @xmath132 saturates at @xmath164 [ yen / s ] for our model system , wherein the time interval of the rate change @xmath59 obeys the weibull distribution with @xmath165 , and the difference of the rate @xmath135 follows the skew - normal distribution ( [ eq : skew - normal ] ) . in this figure",
    ", we also find that if we increase the width @xmath85 of the rate window from @xmath162 to @xmath163 , the reward rate @xmath132 decreases . for companies or internet banks , this kind of information might be useful because they can control the reward rate ( this takes both positive and negative values ) for their customers by tuning the width @xmath85 of the rate window in their computer simulations .",
    "moreover , we should note that we can also evaluate the expected reward @xmath166 , which is the return that the customers can expect to encounter after they log in to their computer systems . by combining the result obtained in this section @xmath167 [ yen / s ] and the average waiting time @xmath168 [ s ] ,",
    "we conclude that the expected reward should be smaller than @xmath169 [ yen ] .",
    "this result seems to be important and useful for both the customers and the bank , e.g. in setting the transaction cost .",
    "of course , the probabilistic model considered here for @xmath13 or @xmath136 is just an example for explaining the stochastic process of the real or empirical rate change .",
    "therefore , several modifications are needed to conduct a much deeper investigation from theoretical viewpoint .",
    "nevertheless , our formulation might be particularly useful in dealing with price changes in real financial markets .",
    "in this paper , we introduced the concept of queueing theory to analyse price changes in a financial market , for which , we focus on the usd / jpy exchange rate of sony bank , which is an internet - based bank . using the renewal - reward theorem and on the assumption that the sony bank rate is described by a first - passage process",
    "whose fpt distribution follows a weibull distribution , we evaluated the average waiting time that sony bank customers have to wait until the next rate change after they log in to their computer systems .",
    "the theoretical prediction and the result from the empirical data analysis are in good agreement on the value of the average waiting time .",
    "moreover , our analysis revealed that if we assume that the sony bank rate is described by a poisson arrival process with an exponential fpt distribution , the average waiting time predicted by the renewal - reward theorem is half the result predicted by the empirical data analysis .",
    "this result justifies the non - exponential time intervals of the sony bank usd / jpy exchange rate .",
    "we also evaluated the reward that a customer could be expected to encounter by the next price change after they log in to their computer systems .",
    "we assumed that the return and fpt follow skew - normal and weibull distributions , respectively , and found that the expected return for sony bank customers is smaller than @xmath170 yen .",
    "this kind of information about statistical properties might be useful for both the costumers and bank s system engineers .",
    "as mentioned earlier , in this paper , we applied queueing theoretical analysis to the sony bank rate , which is generated as a first - passage process with a rate window of width @xmath171 .",
    "we did not mention the high - frequency raw data underlying behind the sony bank rate because sony bank does not record raw data and the data itself is not available to us .",
    "although our results did not suffer from this lack of information , the raw data seems to be attractive and interesting as a material for financial analysis . in particular ,",
    "the effect of the rate window on high - frequency raw data should be investigated empirically .",
    "however , it is impossible for us to conduct such an investigation for the sony bank rate . to compensate for this lack of information",
    ", we performed the garch simulations , wherein the duration between price changes in the raw data obeys a weibull distribution with parameter @xmath80 .",
    "next , we investigated the effect of the rate window through the first - passage time distribution under the assumption that it might follow a weibull distribution with parameter @xmath172 .",
    "the @xmath80-@xmath40 plot was thus obtained .",
    "nevertheless , an empirical data analysis to investigate the effect might be important .",
    "such a study is beyond the scope of this paper ; however , it is possible for us to generate the first - passage process from other high - frequency raw data such as btp futures .",
    "this analysis is currently under way and the results will be reported in our forthcoming article @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in table i , the amount of data per day for the sony bank rate is about @xmath173 points , which is less than the tick - by - tick high - frequency data .",
    "this is because the sony bank rate is generated as a first - passage process of the raw data .",
    "this means that the number of data is too few to confirm whether time - varying behaviour is actually observed . in our investigation of the limited data",
    ", we found that the first - passage time distribution in a specific time regime ( e.g. monday of each week ) obeys a weibull distribution , but the parameter @xmath40 is slightly different from @xmath174 .",
    "however , this result has not yet confirmed because of the low number of data points .",
    "therefore , we used the entire data ( about @xmath175 points from september 2002 to may 2004 ) to determine the weibull distribution . in this paper , we focused on the evaluation of the average waiting time and achieved the level of accuracy mentioned above . in addition , if sony bank records more data in future , we might resolve this issue , namely , whether the sony bank rate exhibits time - varying behaviour .",
    "this is an important area for future investigation .",
    "although we dealt with the sony bank usd / jpy exchange rate in this paper , our approach is general and applicable to other stochastic processes in financial markets .",
    "we hope that it is widely used to evaluate various useful statistics in real markets .",
