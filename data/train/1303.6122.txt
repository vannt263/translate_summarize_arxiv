    ", we may construct cusped hyperbolic manifolds in various ways , for instance by removing a knot or link complement from @xmath9 .",
    "there are essentially two different techniques to prove that a link complement is hyperbolic : by decomposing it into geodesic ideal hyperbolic polyhedra , or by checking that the manifold does not contain an immersed essential surface with @xmath10 and thus invoking geometrisation .",
    "the first method was used by thurston in his notes @xcite , where he constructed various hyperbolic @xmath3-manifolds with an arbitrary number of cusps .",
    "the computer program snappy @xcite may be used to check the hyperbolicity of any link with a reasonable number of crossings .    in higher dimensions , constructing hyperbolic manifolds is more complicated . due to the absence of a geometrisation theorem of any kind , the hyperbolic structure on a smooth manifold needs to be established explicitly , and this",
    "is typically done either by arithmetic methods or by assembling geodesic polyhedra .",
    "the largest known census of cusped hyperbolic @xmath11-manifolds is the list produced by j.  ratcliffe and s.  tschantz @xcite which contains @xmath12 distinct manifolds , all obtained by pairing isometrically the faces of the ideal hyperbolic @xmath13-cell : these manifolds have either @xmath14 or @xmath15 cusps .",
    "we construct here the first example of a finite - volume hyperbolic four - manifold having only one cusp .",
    "one of the motivations for this work is a result by d.  long and a.  reid @xcite which shows that , amongst the six diffeomorphism types of orientable flat @xmath3-manifolds , at least two of them can not be cusp sections of a single - cusped four - manifold ( but they are sections in some multi - cusped one @xcite ) .",
    "the authors then asked @xcite whether any single - cusped hyperbolic manifold exists in dimension @xmath16 .",
    "the techniques introduced in the present paper answer this question in the affirmative if the dimension is @xmath17 , but are not applicable in higher dimensions .",
    "we note that by a recent result of m.  stover @xcite there are no single - cusped hyperbolic _ arithmetic _",
    "orbifolds in dimension @xmath18 . in the present paper , we show that there are plenty of single - cusped hyperbolic four - manifolds , and more generally of hyperbolic four - manifolds with any given number @xmath19 of cusps .",

    ", we say that a flat manifold _",
    "bounds geometrically _ a hyperbolic manifold if it is diffeomorphic to a cusp section of some single - cusped hyperbolic manifold . by analysing the cusp shapes we deduce the following corollary .",
    "the @xmath3-torus bounds geometrically a hyperbolic manifold .",
    "in fact , ontaneda has proved that every flat manifold bounds geometrically a negatively pinched riemannian manifold @xcite , but long and reid showed that at least two among the six orientable flat @xmath3-manifolds can not bound a hyperbolic manifold @xcite . as we said above , the @xmath3-torus is the first example of a connected flat manifold of dimension @xmath29 that bounds a hyperbolic manifold .    the proof of theorem [ v : intro : teo ] is constructive and proceeds as follows .",
    "ideal hyperbolic @xmath13-cell _ @xmath30 is a well - known ideal right - angled four - dimensional hyperbolic polytope with @xmath13 facets and @xmath13 ideal vertices : each facet is a regular ideal octahedron .",
    "the @xmath13 facets are naturally divided into three sets of @xmath31 facets each , which we colour correspondingly in green , red and blue .",
    "we produce four identical copies @xmath32 and @xmath33 of @xmath30 and identify the corresponding red and blue facets as described by the pattern below : @xmath34 \\ar@{<->}_b[d ] & { \\ensuremath { \\mathscr{c}}}_{12 } \\ar@{<->}^b[d ] \\\\",
    "{ \\ensuremath { \\mathscr{c}}}_{21 }   \\ar@{<->}_r[r ] & { \\ensuremath { \\mathscr{c}}}_{22}}\\ ] ] that is , we identify the red facets `` horizontally '' and the blue facets `` vertically '' .",
    "the resulting object is a four - dimensional complete hyperbolic manifold @xmath35 with non - compact geodesic boundary .",
    "the geodesic boundary is formed by the @xmath36 green facets which were left un - paired and has eight components , each isometric to a well - known cusped hyperbolic three - manifold : the complement of the chain link shown in fig .",
    "[ chainlink : fig ] .",
    "the block @xmath35 has eight boundary components and @xmath13 cusps , each diffeomorphic to @xmath37 \\times [ 0,+\\infty)$ ] : this is a four - dimensional analogue of the annular cusps arising in dimension three .",
    "it turns out that @xmath35 looks combinatorially much alike as a four - dimensional hypercube @xmath38 : the eight boundary components correspond to the facets of @xmath38 and the @xmath13 cusps correspond to the @xmath13 two - dimensional faces of @xmath38 .",
    "this combinatorial correspondence preserves all the geometric adjacencies .    as usual , we define a four - dimensional _ cubulation _ as the combinatorial data that consists of @xmath4 ( four - dimensional ) hypercubes and an isometric pairing of the resulting @xmath39 facets . having noticed that @xmath35 looks like a hypercube , we may transform every cubulation into an orientable complete finite - volume cusped hyperbolic four - manifold by substituting every hypercube with an instance of @xmath35 and glueing the geodesic boundaries as described by the combinatorics of the facet pairing .",
    "this construction was inspired by a similar algorithm introduced in @xcite , which transforms a triangulation into a hyperbolic @xmath3-manifold .",
    "we have constructed a map @xmath40    various informations on the topology and geometry of the resulting hyperbolic four - manifold @xmath41 can be derived directly from the cubulation .",
    "the volume of @xmath41 is @xmath42 where @xmath4 is the number of hypercubes in the cubulation .",
    "the cusps of @xmath41 may be recovered as follows : the facet - pairings in the cubulation induce a partition of the @xmath43 two - dimensional faces into cycles , and every cycle corresponds to a cusp .",
    "therefore , in order to construct a hyperbolic four - manifold with one cusp we only need to construct a cubulation where all two - dimensional faces become identified ( shortly : a cubulation with only one @xmath44-face ) .",
    "this can be done with a single hypercube .    the mostow - prasad rigidity together with the epstein - penner canonical decomposition @xcite ensure us that combinatorially distinct cubulations produce non - homeomorphic four - manifolds .",
    "in other words , the map from the set of cubulation into the set of cusped hyperbolic manifolds described above is injective .",
    "therefore , in order to prove that @xmath45 we only need to show that the number of cubulations with @xmath4 hypercubes and one @xmath44-face grows faster than @xmath46 .",
    "the algorithm that transforms cubulations into hyperbolic manifolds can also be used to construct plenty of _ closed _ riemannian four - manifolds with non - positive sectional curvature or with einstein metrics .",
    "it suffices to construct a cubulation where every cusp is homeomorphic to a @xmath3-torus ( this condition is easily checked combinatorially ) and then perform a dehn filling , _",
    "i.e. _  glue a copy of @xmath47 at each cusp .",
    "the dehn filling is encoded by a triple @xmath48 of co - prime integers , and if the triple is sufficiently complicated the resulting manifold admits a non - positively curved metric ( by gromov - thurston s @xmath49 theorem , see @xcite ) and even an einstein metric thanks to a theorem of anderson @xcite that extends thurston s dehn filling theorem to all dimensions .",
    "thus , various closed einstein four - manifolds can be constructed on the basis of a simple combinatorial data : this can be seen as an analogue of presenting closed hyperbolic @xmath3-manifolds as dehn surgeries along links in @xmath9 .",
    "we introduce the building block @xmath35 in section [ block : section ] , and then use it in order to transform cubulations into hyperbolic four - manifolds in section [ cubulations : section ] .",
    "we apply this construction in section [ manifolds : section ] completing the proof of theorem [ v : intro : teo ] .",
    "finally , we discuss dehn fillings in section [ dehn : section ] .",
    "we define the object which will play the central rle in the sequel , namely , the building block @xmath35 .",
    "this is a hyperbolic four - dimensional finite - volume manifold with non - compact totally geodesic boundary . in the following section we shall use @xmath35 in order to transform any cubulation into a hyperbolic four - manifold .",
    "let us start with the description of a cusped hyperbolic @xmath3-manifold whose eight disjoint isometric copies will form the boundary of the block @xmath35 .    let @xmath50 be a regular ideal hyperbolic octahedron .",
    "let us colour the faces of @xmath50 in blue and red in the chequerboard fashion ( thus , every edge of @xmath50 is adjacent to a red and a blue triangle ) .",
    "now we take four identical copies @xmath51 and @xmath52 of @xmath50 and pair their faces following the rules below :    * for @xmath53 we glue each red face of @xmath54 to the corresponding red face of @xmath55 ; * for @xmath56 we glue each blue face of @xmath57 to the corresponding blue face of @xmath58 .",
    "the facets are matched by identifying all the pairs of corresponding points in them by means of a hyperbolic isometry .",
    "the rules are summarised in the following glueing diagram : @xmath59 \\ar@{<->}_b[d ] & o_{12 } \\ar@{<->}^b[d ] \\\\",

    "we call @xmath60 the _ octahedral manifold_. we may define an involution @xmath62 by interchanging @xmath63 with @xmath52 and @xmath64 with @xmath65 . the quotient orbifold @xmath66 may be then described as @xmath67^r \\ar@<-1ex>@{<->}_b[r ] & o_{12}.   } \\ ] ] it is tessellated by two isometric octahedra , with all the corresponding faces identified",

    "[ hexatangle : fig ] shows that @xmath60 is homeomorphic to the complement of the minimally twisted six chain link .",

    "* theorem  3.6 ) of @xmath60 and therefore are preserved by any isometry . on the other hand , every isometry @xmath80 of @xmath50 is realised by an isometry of @xmath60 : if @xmath80 preserves the red - blue colouring , then it suffices to act by @xmath80 on each @xmath81 , if it inverts the colouring then we act by @xmath80 on each @xmath81 and then exchange @xmath63 with @xmath52 , in order to invert the colourings in the square diagram ( [ o : eqn ] ) , so that the resulting isometry is well - defined on @xmath60 .    the kernel of the surjective map @xmath82 consists of all isometries of @xmath60 that fix the cusps .",
    "these are naturally identified with the symmetries of the square ( [ o : eqn ] ) that preserve the red - blue colouring .",

    "the action of @xmath62 on each cusp is non - trivial : the cusp shape is a square torus , and @xmath62 acts like a reflection with respect to the centre of the square .",
    "therefore @xmath62 acts as an elliptic involution , whose effect on the homology is multiplication by @xmath84 .",
    "let @xmath85 be a torus inside an orientable closed three - manifold .",

    "the _ 24-cell _ @xmath30 is the only regular polytope in all dimensions @xmath29 which is self - dual and not a simplex .",

    "one checks easily that @xmath30 has @xmath13 facets , whose affine supporting hyperplanes are @xmath90 each facet is a regular octahedron .",
    "the dual polytope @xmath91 is therefore the convex hull @xmath92 where @xmath93 contains the @xmath31 points obtained by permuting the coordinates of @xmath94 and @xmath95 contains @xmath96 points of the form @xmath97 it is convenient to partition the latter set into @xmath98 where @xmath99 ( resp .",

    "this analogy is the core of our construction .",
    "restricted to the facets , this analogy is just the duality of polyhedra : an octahedral green facet of @xmath30 is dual to a cubic facet of @xmath38 , both contained in the same affine hyperplane @xmath109 .",
    "the duality map sends the vertices of the octahedron to the square faces of the cube .",
    "although we will not use it here , we mention that the analogy extends to all the strata of @xmath38 , as follows : @xmath110 @xmath111      every @xmath4-dimensional regular polytope @xmath112 has a hyperbolic ideal presentation obtained by normalising the coordinates of its vertices so that they lie on the unit sphere @xmath113 and by interpreting @xmath113 as the ideal boundary of @xmath114 in klein s ball model .    note",
    "that the vertex figure of an ideal vertex is a euclidean regular @xmath7-dimensional polytope in some horosphere , whose dihedral angles coincide with the dihedral angles of @xmath112 .",
    "for that reason , the ideal regular hyperbolic tetrahedron , cube , octahedron and dodecahedron have coxeter dihedral angles @xmath115 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 , respectively , since their vertex figures are either equilateral triangles or squares .    in what follows",
    "we keep denoting by @xmath30 the ideal regular hyperbolic @xmath13-cell obtained from the euclidean 24-cell @xmath30 defined in section [ euclidean : cell : subsection ] in the way described above .",
    "the vertex figure of @xmath30 is a euclidean cube and therefore @xmath30 has all dihedral angles @xmath61 .",
    "the @xmath13-cell is the unique regular four - dimensional polytope having cubical vertex figures : the vertex figures of the other five regular four - dimensional polytopes are other platonic solids , and therefore their dihedral angles are not sub - multiples of @xmath118 . hence @xmath30 may be used as a building block in order to construct cusped hyperbolic @xmath11-manifolds , as shown by j.  ratcliffe and s.  tschantz @xcite .",
    "the boundary of @xmath30 consists of @xmath13 regular ideal hyperbolic octahedra , @xmath105 ideal triangular @xmath44-dimensional faces and @xmath105 geodesic edges .",
    "recall that the octahedral facets of @xmath30 are coloured in green , red and blue .",
    "we now glue four isometric copies of @xmath30 together to produce a hyperbolic @xmath11-manifold @xmath35 with totally geodesic boundary .      in section [ o : subsection ]",
    "we constructed the octahedral hyperbolic @xmath3-manifold @xmath60 by glueing four copies of the regular ideal octahedron @xmath50 according to the diagram ( [ o : eqn ] ) , and by employing the bi - colouring of @xmath50 .",
    "now we construct the building block @xmath35 from @xmath30 exactly in the same way , using the colouring of its facets .",
    "we pick four isometric copies of @xmath30 , which we denote by @xmath32 and @xmath33 , then pair some of their facets as follows :    * for @xmath53 we glue each red facet of @xmath119 to the corresponding red facet of @xmath55 ; * for @xmath56 we glue each blue facet of @xmath120 to the corresponding blue facet of @xmath58 .",
