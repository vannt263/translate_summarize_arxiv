    "streams of stars and gas have been observed in the mw and have been linked to previous accretion of satellite galaxies @xcite .",
    "the magellanic stream @xcite observed in 21-cm emission is the result of the interaction between the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc , respectively ) and the mw and may , gigayears hence , result in the merger of the magellanic and mw galaxies . on the stellar side ,",
    "the advent of the sloan digital sky survey @xcite has led to an explosion in the discovery of stellar streams in the mw halo ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , all of which presumably have their origin in minor mergers in the galaxy s past .    in the past decade",
    "our knowledge of the structure of our nearest large galactic neighbor , m31 , has undergone a similar transformation .",
    "deep , wide - field imaging by @xcite revealed a large stream of stars extending from near the center of m31 several degrees to the south east close to the minor axis of the galaxy .",
    "subsequent studies @xcite found that this giant stellar stream ( gss ) exists as a coherent structure more than 4  on the sky , inclined at @xmath060  with respect to the line of sight , and extending over @xmath2 kpc .",
    "the gss is aligned with the major m31 satellites m32 and ngc205 and , while it is tempting to associate the stream with those companions , modeling shows that it most likely represents the trailing arm left from a recent , radial merger of a galaxy of @xmath3 m@xmath4 ( mori & rich 2008 , fardal et al .",
    "alternatively it may be the fossil remnant of a cannibalized satellite or a tidal bridge connecting to its neighboring spiral m33 .",
    "@xcite found from hubble space telescope ( hst ) color - magnitude diagrams that the stream and halo fields are indistinguishable , which suggests that only one progenitor was responsible for the debris deposited in inner halo regions .",
    "however , if dynamical mixing were efficient , it could erase the signatures from different infall sources .",
    "further deep imaging and stellar spectroscopic studies have shown that the halo of the m31-m33 system is far more complicated than originally thought and hints at an eventful formation history ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to the gss , many other structures have been discovered within the halo of m31 .",
    "some of these structures are associated with the large and growing population of andromeda satellite galaxies @xcite and globular clusters @xcite , while others are less clearly connected .",
    "it has been suggested that many of the stream - like features in the halo could result from the heating of m31 s thin disk that has been ejected during a recent merger ( e.g. , richardson et al .",

    "2015 ) .",
    "we know relatively little about the progenitor of the gss .",
    "modeling of the encounter leads to mass estimates ranging from @xmath5 m@xmath4 ( hammer et al .",

    "( 2015 ) suggest an early - type galaxy as a candidate , which experienced rapid chemical enrichment to solar abundances already by @xmath8 .",
    "however , no neutral gas analogous to the magellanic stream is evident in the immediate vicinity of the gss ( braun et al .",
    "a recent re - analysis of the hi data by lewis et al .",
    "( 2013 ) showed the presence of gas filaments , bridging m31 and the near - by spiral m33 , although they are significantly offset from the stellar stream .",
    "lewis et al . ( 2013 ) also identified a number of individual gas clouds , but noted a remarkable lack of any spatial correlation between stellar and gaseous substructures , arguing for several dynamical processes at play that affect both components in different ways .",
    "the only gas associated with the gss thus appears at the point where it passes the disk of m31 .",
    "absorption - line spectroscopy provides a different and complementary tool for analyzing the structure and kinematics of circumgalactic matter ( e.g. , rao et al . 2013 ) .",
    "stellar spectroscopy provides a representative view of stellar kinematics and overall metallicities , while absorption spectroscopy of background sources gives kinematic and chemical information about the _ gas phase _ in the system . in this paper , we present far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) spectra of three active galactic nuclei ( agn ) obtained with the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) onboard the hst .",
    "these three sight lines probe the m31 halo at projected distances of 2651 kpc in three different quadrants of the system ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "we see strong absorption from gas near the systemic velocity of m31 in all three sight lines .",

    "since the two objects hs0033@xmath114300 and hs0058@xmath114213 were observed with a single cos grating position , each dataset features a pair of @xmath12   gaps in the spectral coverage , corresponding to the gap between the two far - uv detectors .",
    "we fit continua to each of the data sets using a semi - automated line identification and spline - fitting technique as follows .",
    "first , the spectra are split into 510   segments .",
    "continuum pixels within each segment are identified as those for which the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio vector is less than 1.5 @xmath13 below the median s / n value for all the pixels in the segment .",
    "thus , absorption lines ( flux lower than the segment average ) are excluded , as are regions of increased noise ( error higher than segment average ) .",
    "the process is iterated to convergence and a spline is fitted through the mean continuum pixel value in each segment .",
    "we check the continuum fit of each entire spectrum manually and the continuum region identifications are adjusted as needed .",
    "the continuum identification and spline - fitting processes work reasonably well for smoothly varying data , but they were augmented with piecewise - continuous legendre polynomial fits in a few cases . in particular , spline fits perform poorly in regions of sharp spectral curvature , such as the galactic ly@xmath14  absorption and at the peaks of cuspy emission lines .",
    "complete details on the process are given in danforth et al .",
    "( 2014 ) .",
    "the region around m31 has previously been mapped in the 21 cm emission line of  by several authors .",
    "@xcite conducted a green bank telescope ( gbt ) survey of the region , while @xcite present a deep survey in the m31 region made with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) operated in total - power mode ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "while the absorption - line data are much more sensitive than emission , the cos data give no information on the neutral hydrogen column density since the mw damped ly@xmath14  absorption profile extends over thousands of km  s@xmath15 .",
    "unfortunately , the velocity calibration of the uv spectra is uncertain to a much larger degree than radio emission data .",
    "hst spectra are recorded in a heliocentric velocity frame with an on - board wavelength calibration lamp .",
    "however , the precise wavelength solution varies by @xmath00.2   ( @xmath02 resolution elements ) over the detector and the zero point is uncertain by @xmath015 kms@xmath15 due to inaccuracies in centering the target in the cos aperture inherent to the target acquisition procedure .",
    "the coalition process cross - correlates strong absorption lines in each detector segment in each exposure with each other before coaddition , so the relative wavelength solution over a few ngstroms is reasonably accurate .",
    "however , no cross - segment wavelength correlation is attempted .",
    "we correct for these effects to first order by aligning narrow low - ionization metal absorption lines in the data in velocity space to the  21-cm profiles from the leiden - argentine - bonn survey @xcite .",
    "the  emission toward all three sight lines shows a peak at @xmath16 km  s@xmath15  with significant , distributed emission toward negative velocities .",
    "fits to the q0045@xmath113926 cos data show the reddest absorption component in several ions at @xmath17 km  s@xmath15 .",
    "poor data quality in the other two spectra hampers this analysis rather severely , but the strongest galactic absorption appears to be at @xmath18 km  s@xmath15 .",
    "these values do not vary considerably with rest wavelength , so we adopt a uniform velocity shift of @xmath19 km  s@xmath15  for q0045@xmath113926 and @xmath20 km  s@xmath15  for hs0033@xmath114300 and hs0058@xmath114213 to bring the data approximately into the local standard of rest ( lsr ) reference frame .",
    "overall , we estimate a systematic velocity uncertainty of @xmath21 km  s@xmath15  inherent in the absolute velocity of any absorption measurements henceforth .",
    "we measure absorption features in three ways .",
    "firstly , unsaturated absorption features with clear component structure can be fitted via the apparent optical depth ( aod ) and profile - weighted mean quantity methods @xcite .",
    "secondly , multi - component voigt profile fits often provide more accurate measurements in cases of mildly saturated lines .",
    "the significance of any individual line fit is calculated based on the local s / n ratio , the doppler @xmath22-parameter , and fitted equivalent width via the algorithms of @xcite . finally , we make use of _ simultaneous _ multi - component voigt profile fits to multiple transitions of the same species , e.g. ,  1260.42 , 1193.29 , 1190.42 , and 1526.70  .",
    "these techniques produce equivalent results for absorption profiles of moderate strength , but each has its advantages in different circumstances : voigt fitting , which is generally preferred , can accurately measure lines which are moderately saturated ( @xmath2323 ) .",
    "the down - side of this technique is that a velocity component structure must be assumed .",
    "aod measurements are well - suited for shallow , noisy absorbers or where the component structure is uncertain , while this method tends to under - estimate column densities for very strong absorbers .",
    "the latter does not pose a concern in our only mildly saturated absorbers . for details on the consistencies between the methods ,",
    "we refer the reader to danforth & shull ( 2008 ; and references therein ) .",

    "finally , while no stellar velocities are available in the vicinity of hs 0033 + 4300 , the simulations predict that a rather diffuse stream component should be seen at highly negative velocities and another peak that blends into the mw foreground , above @xmath00 kms@xmath15 ( fig .  5 , bottom ) .",
    "the gas absorption seen at @xmath149 and , more weakly , @xmath153 kms@xmath15 thus appears to be consistent with typical halo gas .",
    "all three sight lines thus show absorption at near the systemic velocity of the m31 halo ( @xmath142 km  s@xmath15 ) , considering the stellar halo s broad velocity dispersion ( at @xmath085 kms@xmath15 ; reitzel & guhathakurta 2002 ) .",
    "q0045@xmath113926 shows two clear components separated by @xmath162 km  s@xmath15  and it is clear from the ratios of high ions to low ions that these components have different ionization properties in different sightlines , in that the @xmath163 kms@xmath15 system shows weaker civ and stronger low - ionization lines than the one @xmath164 kms@xmath15 .",
    "similarly , towards hs0033@xmath114300 ,  and  absorption is seen near @xmath165 km  s@xmath15  while  and  show absorption centroids at @xmath166 km  s@xmath15 .    in conclusion",
    ", we note that stars are found with velocities consistent with all the three absorbing systems in the vicinity of the agn sight lines , which is a manifestation of the large velocity dispersion of the m31 halo system .",
    "based on the observed stellar velocities and the comparison with the simulations of @xcite we argue that the lowest - velocity component present in the agn spectra are associated with the stream itself .      with our measurements of many metal ion column densities , it is possible to constrain the physical conditions in the absorbing gas with simple photoionization models . to this end ,",
    "we compare measured column densities with a grid of cloudy models developed for circumgalactic absorbers ( described fully in * ? ? ?",
    "briefly , a slab of gas is illuminated by an ionizing continuum given by the extragalactic radiation field of @xcite . as in keeney",
    "et al . ( 2013 ) , we use a purely - extragalactic ( agn ) background since all three of our sight lines probe regions outside m31 s proximity zone where ionizing flux from early - type stars is expected to have an effect ( @xmath167 kpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "we calculate a grid of models where free parameters ionization parameter @xmath168 and metallicity @xmath169 are varied to provide a grid of model conditions .",
    "best - fit model parameters for the three absorption components toward q0045@xmath113926 are listed in table  4 .",

    "the strongest constraints are provided by siii / iii / iv , though cii / iv ratios are generally consistent .",
    "absorption at the velocity of m31 is unrecoverably blended with galactic absorption which makes the metallicity of the absorbing gas difficult to constrain directly .",
    "we set an upper limit of @xmath217 since the q0045@xmath113926  sight line lies outside the lowest  21 cm column density contour of @xcite .",
    "however , we can infer @xmath218  for each component by finding the range of total column density @xmath219 over which all of the silicon ion column densities in a given component can be explained simultaneously in a single , purely - photoionized phase of a given metallicity @xmath169 .",
    "this gives values for @xmath219 and @xmath169 .",
    "these quantities , along with the hydrogen neutral fraction ( @xmath220 , uniquely given by the ionization parameter above ) determines the neutral hydrogen column density @xmath218  all within fairly large uncertainties @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium temperature , @xmath221 , is a value returned by the best - fit @xmath222 model .",
    "a line - of - sight cloud size is then inferred in turn as @xmath223 . assuming a spherical cloud of constant density",
    ", we calculate a cloud mass @xmath224 .",
    "we note that many assumptions have gone into these models and quantities farther down the chain of logic should be taken correspondingly with appropriate caution .",
    "modeled ionization parameters are probably reasonably accurate while inferred cloud mass may be inaccurate by orders of magnitude or more .    the cloudy model best fit parameters are @xmath225 for both the gss gas and the component at @xmath149 km  s@xmath15 , typical of conditions seen in the mw halo ( e.g. , shull et al . 2011 ) . the gas at @xmath140 km  s@xmath15   appears to be more highly ionized ( @xmath226 ) and thus typical of gas in `` highly - ionized '' hvcs , which is in agreement with the qualitative estimates of the respective line strengths seen in fig .  2 .",
    "the derived metallicities for the three absorption components along the q0045@xmath113926 sight line are all consistent with solar or slightly super - solar metallicity , though with large uncertainties .",
    "in particular , for the two m31-velocity components which are kinematically unrelated to the gss and presumably trace gas in the halo of m31 ( see also lehner et al .",
    "2015 ) , these values are higher than the average stellar metallicities in the , generally more metal - poor , halo .",
    "@xcite found stellar metallicities of [ fe / h]@xmath227 dex in fields at 2040 kpc from the galactic center .",
    "stars in the giant stream , however , are known to be more metal - rich than the surrounding halo stars ( brown et al .",
    "2006 ; koch et al .",
    "for instance , ibata et al .",
    "( 2001 ) reported on an average [ fe / h ] of approximately @xmath228 dex , while bernard et al .",
    "( 2015 ) list a median metallicity of @xmath229 dex based on their hst photometry",
    ". moreover , the metallicity distributions of gilbert et al . ( 2009 ) peak at @xmath230 dex and indicate a significant population of stars with roughly solar metallicity in fields dominated by gss material .",
    "these findings support our measurement of solar metallicity in the stream gas , especially if one considers all the different , employed measurement techniques in the studies , from stellar calcium triplet spectroscopy , to color magnitude diagram fitting , and our modeling of the gas phase metallicity .",
    "given the poor quality of the data for the hs0058@xmath114213 and hs0033@xmath114300 sight lines we hesitate to place much weight on their model results .",
    "however , they are presented in table  4 for completeness .",
    "we have investigated three sight lines in the m31 halo using hst / cos and agn as background sources .",
    "all of the sight lines exhibit components that we associate with the milky way , and as well , a component at @xmath149 to @xmath140 kms@xmath15 that we assign to the disk of m31 . in the sight line of q0045 + 3926 , which is projected @xmath02.7 kpc from m31 s giant stellar stream , we find  and  absorption at @xmath152 kms@xmath15 , the most negative detected velocities in our sample .",
    "the bulk of _ stellar _ velocities in the gss covers a broad range , reflecting a strong radial velocity gradient across its body .",
    "stars in the immediate vicinity of the agn sightline move at near @xmath154 kms@xmath15 , while other stream components have been found at velocities closer to our observed gas velocity ( ibata et al .",
    "2004 , 2015 ; koch et al . 2008 ; gilbert et al .",
    "2009 ) , albeit at larger projected distances . aided by simulations of the merger that formed the gss , fardal et al .",
    "( 2008 ) suggested that many of its morphological features could best be reproduced with a rotating disk - progenitor . in that case , a detachment of the stellar from the gas velocities would occur naturally .",
    "it is obvious that different mechanisms were at play , contrasting the tidal disruption of the stellar component of the stream progenitor with the gas removal by ram - pressure stripping in m31 s hot circumgalactic corona ( mayer et al .",
    "2006 , lewis et al . 2013 ; lehner et al .",
    "likewise , the remarkable lack of coherence between stellar structures and presently detected large - scale gas in the halo emphasizes the complexity of the gss formation and dynamics ( lewis et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "further evidence for a stream - gas connection comes from the putatively high metallicity we derived for the gas phase .",
    "the halo of m31 has long been known to have stars with metallicity similar to that of 47 tuc ( mould & kristian 1983 ; rich et al .",
    "even higher metallicities were found in larger surveys , allowing for a better characterization of the main halo polluters .",
    "in fact , the hst - based age - metallicity relation of bernard et al .",
    "( 2015 ) showed that halo fields rich in substructures experienced very rapid chemical enrichment so that , by a redshift of @xmath8 , solar metallicities were in place .",
    "this kind of evolutionary history is typically found in early - type ( dwarf ) galaxies ( e.g. , layden & sarajedini 2000 ; bonifacio et al .",
    "2004 ; hendricks et al . 2014 ) , allowing one to place further constraints on the progenitor s identikit .",
    "this emphasises the importance to increase the density of observational sampling of absorbers within the inner 30 kpc of the m31 halo .",
    "this will be eased in the future by the increasing number of known agn at suitable redshifts and magnitudes behind the m31m33 system , as listed , e.g. , by huo et al .",
