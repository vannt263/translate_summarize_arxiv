    "the prediction of a possible existence of a deconfined quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase at high temperature and/or density by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) opened up a new challanging task of detection of this deconfined state of strongly interacting matter  @xcite .",
    "it seems worth exploring the nature and properties of this novel state by proposing some suitable probes .",
    "heavy quarkonia are expected to play an important role in testing qcd and investigating the nature of the qcd phase of quarks and gluons  @xcite .",
    "heavy quarkonia ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 etc . )",
    "suppressions have long been considered as a clean signal for deconfining phase transition and qgp formation in the heavy ion collision experiments  @xcite .",
    "the idea relies mainly on colour screening mechanism of heavy quark potential similar to the electric charge screening in qed plasma  @xcite .",
    "however , the anomalaous suppression can not be assigned to debye screening alone in qgp  @xcite .",
    "complications arise from the other factors like the existence of landau damping of heavy quark potential  @xcite , the non - perturbative effects involved in the study of qcd phase transition from hadron gas ( hg ) to qgp and the suppression of heavy quarkonia from conventional nuclear effects collectively known as cold nuclear matter ( cnm ) effects  @xcite eg . , nuclear absorption , shadowing and anti - shadowing in parton distribution functions , etc .",
    "further it is observed that charmonia states e.g. @xmath2 etc .",
    "are not very suitable probes because significant contributions arise from the regeneration effects also at higher energies especially at lhc where statistical production of @xmath3 and @xmath4 becomes large  @xcite . in comparison to charmonia",
    ", the suppression pattern of upsilon ( @xmath1 ) and its excited states is regarded as cleaner signals to study the properties of the medium created at high temperature and/or density .",
    "the factors responsible for this fact are large masses and small binding radii of various bottomonia states . due to large masses",
    ", the probability of regeneration of bottomonia by possible coalescence of @xmath5 pair is expected to be almost negligible in comparison to charmonia states . however , a recent work by emerick and collaborators have shown that the regeneration can still play an important role in the upsilon production  @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the contribution depends on an interplay of the masses of the open- and hidden - bottom states in a system with fixed @xmath6 content .",
    "further , the smallness of the ratio of hidden- to open - bottom states in elementary collisions implies that even small contributions to bottomonium regeneration can be significant relative to primordial production . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors have considered the temperature dependence of bottomonia binding energies in weak - binding scenario ( wbs ) and/or strong - binding scenario ( sbs ) . in weak binding scenario ,",
    "the effect of regeneration through recombination is very less .",
    "however , it becomes significant in the case of sbs  @xcite .",
    "the major hurdle in estimating precisely the anomalous suppression of quarkonia involves the almost unknown background contribution as discussed previously .",
    "it is argued recently that if we take the ratio of the yields of different bottomonia states , then cnm effects should almost cancel out in the ratio  @xcite and one can get the amount of suppression arising solely due to qgp .",
    "thus , the suppression pattern of various states of @xmath1 can provide an important insight into the properties of the medium created in heavy ion collisions .",
    "bottomonia suppressions in heavy - ion collisions have experimentally been studied at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) by star  @xcite and phenix  @xcite experiments at @xmath7 gev . however , due to limited vertex resolution , they are not able to disentangle different bottomonia states ie . , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 .",
    "thus star only provided the nuclear modification factor for the combined production of different states ie .",
    ", @xmath11 , with respect to the number of participants ( @xmath12 )  @xcite . recently cms detector at large hadron collider ( lhc ) has measured the suppression patterns of different upsilon states separately .",
    "the cms collaboration reported their initial measurements for the absolute @xmath13 suppression as well as the relative suppression for @xmath14 with respect to @xmath8 and find that the excited states @xmath15 are suppressed with respect to @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "further they have also presented the suppression patterns of different states of upsilon separately with a larger data set and show their relative ratios also and finally observed the sequential suppression of bottomonia states  @xcite .",
    "they have also plotted the ratios of nuclear modification factors of different upsilon states  @xcite to illustrate the anomalous suppression arising due to qgp without any cnm effect as suggested by earlier studies  @xcite . however , a vigorous experimental effort to quantify cnm effects is still continuing at rhic  @xcite .",
    "we have recently modified the colour - screening model of chu and matsui  @xcite by following two steps .",
    "firstly we parametrize the pressure  @xcite instead of energy density as used by them since pressure density becomes almost zero at the deconfining phase transition point .",
    "secondly , we employ the quasiparticle description instead of bag model equation of state ( eos ) for qgp  @xcite .",
    "this highlights a major difference between our present approach and the models of chu , matsui  @xcite or mishra et al  @xcite because bag model often gives a crude eos for qgp .",
    "feed down from higher resonances have also been incorporated in the model .",
    "we have earlier used this model to calculate the survival probability of @xmath0 with respect to number of participant ( @xmath12 ) involved in the collision .",
    "we surprisingly find that our model reproduces the cnm normalized data for @xmath0 suppression at all the energies including cern sps , bnl rhic , and cern lhc energies  @xcite .",
    "the suppression pattern of @xmath0 in the central collision has a complicated pattern of going from @xmath16 at sps , to @xmath17 at rhic and is back up to @xmath18 at lhc .",
    "less suppression for @xmath19 at lhc in comparison to rhic has been observed mainly due to the @xmath20-range used in the integration .",
    "as such experimental @xmath20-range varies between @xmath21 to @xmath22 gev for rhic data while it varies from @xmath23 gev to @xmath24 gev in the case of lhc data .",
    "however , fo sps this range lies between @xmath25 and @xmath26 gev .",
    "we have taken the same @xmath20-range in our model as was used in experimental data .",
    "charmonia involving large momentum will be formed at a later stage as seen in the plasma rest frame .",
    "consequently the region covered by a hot plasma is thus reduced and we thus expect less suppression for such states  @xcite .",
    "larger momentum at lhc makes the survival probability of quarkonia states larger in comparison to the survival probability at rhic for most central collisions .",
    "in addition to the above factor , we should also consider the variation in the energy density which is larger at lhc and hence this causes more dissociations .    in this paper , our motivation is to extend our model for explaining the suppressions of various bottomonia states .",
    "since the suppression of bottomonia due to cold nuclear matter ( cnm ) is not precisely determined , our calculation can be useful to provide an indirect estimate of cnm effect .",
    "we will also calculate the ratio of suppression pattern of various states to see whether the effects of cold nuclear matter in the ratios have any cancellation effect .",
    "further , we also calculate the survival probability for @xmath8 , and @xmath9 with respect to transverse momentum @xmath20 in order to illustrate the success of our model in explaining the experimental data .",
    "we have used the colour screening idea of chu and matsui  @xcite . however ,",
    "instead of using bag model for qgp , we now use quasiparticle model ( qpm ) as new eos of qgp .",
    "we assume that the qgp medium formed during the collision , expands and cools according to the bjorken s boost invariant longitudinal viscous hydrodynamics in mid - rapidity region . employing the conservation of energy - momentum tensor , the rate of the decrease of energy density @xmath27  @xcite is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the shear viscosity of the qgp medium , @xmath30 is the pressure and @xmath31 represents the proper time .",
    "the energy density and pressure are computed by using qpm eos  @xcite for qgp . using eq.(1 ) and",
    "the thermodynamical identity @xmath32 , the cooling laws for energy density and pressure in the qpm model can be separately given as  @xcite : @xmath33    @xmath34    where @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are constants which can be determined by imposing the initial boundary conditions on energy density and pressure , @xmath38 with @xmath39 being the speed of sound in the medium .",
    "we take @xmath40 at @xmath41 ( initial thermalization time ) and also @xmath42 at @xmath43 ; where @xmath44 is the proper time .",
    "consequently , the constants @xmath35 and @xmath36 are given as  @xcite : @xmath45 , where @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the reynold s number for qgp .",
    "further : @xmath49 using the initial condition for @xmath50 at @xmath41 , we find the value of @xmath37 as  @xcite :    @xmath51      we take a pressure profile function in the transverse plane with a transverse distance @xmath52 as  @xcite : @xmath53 where the coefficient @xmath54 is yet to be determined , @xmath55 denotes the radius of the cylinderical plasma and it is related to the transverse overlap area @xmath56 as determined by glauber model @xmath57  @xcite .",
    "the pressure is thus assumed to be maximum at the central axis but it vanishes at the edge @xmath58 where hadronization first begins .",
    "the exponent @xmath59 depends on the energy deposition mechanism and here we have taken @xmath60  @xcite ; @xmath61 is the unit step - function .",
    "the factor @xmath54 is related to the average initial pressure @xmath62  @xcite : @xmath63 the average pressure is determined by the centrality dependent initial average energy density @xmath64 which is further given by bjorken s formula  @xcite : @xmath65 here @xmath66 is the transverse energy deposited per unit rapidity .",
    "we use the experimental value of @xmath67 where @xmath68 is pseudorapidity and then multiply it by a corresponding jacobian factor  @xcite to obtain @xmath69 for a given number of participants ( @xmath12 ) at a particular center - of - mass energy ( @xmath70 ) . at the initial proper time , @xmath71 as given by eos of qgp in qpm  @xcite and thus @xmath72 .",
    "since the cooling law for pressure can not be solved for @xmath31 and , therefore , we use a trick to determine the radius of screening region . writing the cooling law of pressure as follows  @xcite :",
    "@xmath73    where @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 are constants related to @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 as : @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 . writing the above equation at @xmath82 and at screening time @xmath83 we get : @xmath84 and @xmath85 here",
    "@xmath86 is the qgp pressure as determined by eos in qpm  @xcite . solving eqs .",
    "( 11 ) and ( 12 ) numerically and equating the screening time @xmath87 to the dilated formation time of quarkonia @xmath88 ( = @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the lorentz factor associated with the transverse motion of the @xmath5 pair ,",
    "@xmath91 gev and @xmath92 is the proper time required for @xmath5 pair in the formation of @xmath1  @xcite ) , we can find the radius of the screening region @xmath93 .",
    "the screening region involves the temperature larger than the dissociation temperature so that the quarkonia formation becomes unlikely inside that region  @xcite .",
    "hence the pair will in all probability escape from the screening region and form the quarkonia if @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the position vector at which the charm - quark pair is created  @xcite .",
    "the above kinematic condition takes a simplified form by assuming that @xmath1 is moving with transverse momentum @xmath96 .",
    "thus the above escape condition can be expressed in the form of a trigonometric condition  @xcite :    @xmath97    where @xmath98 is the angle between the transverse momentum ( @xmath20 ) and the position vector @xmath95 and @xmath99 with @xmath100 .      assuming the radial probability distribution for the production of @xmath101 pair in hard collisions at transverse distance @xmath52 as @xmath102 here we take @xmath103 in our calculation as used in ref .",
    "then , in the colour screening scenario , the survival probability for the quarkonia can easily be obtained as  @xcite :    @xmath104    where the maximum positive angle @xmath105 allowed by eq .",
    "( 13 ) becomes  @xcite : @xmath106 since the experimentalists always measure the quantity namely @xmath96 integrated nuclear modification factor .",
    "we get the theoretical @xmath96 integrated survival probability as follows :    @xmath107    it has been found that only about @xmath108 of the observed @xmath13 come from hard collisions whereas @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112is from the decay of @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 , respectively  @xcite . therefore , the net survival probability of @xmath13 in the presence of qgp medium is :    @xmath117    similarly , the net survival probability of @xmath113 can be obtained in qgp as  @xcite : @xmath118    .values of the parameters .

    "we find it worthwhile to investigate the effect of @xmath133 in simultaneously explaining the data of rhic and lhc experiments .",

    "moreover , one should keep in mind that from here onwards , we use the same @xmath20 range in all our calculations as was used in the related experimental data .",
    "we find that our model results satisfy the @xmath135 data of @xmath13 for pheripheral collisions .",
    "however there is a difference between our results and experimental data for central collsions .",
    "this suggests that the effect of cnm is mild in pheripheral collisions and it increases with the centrality of the collision . in order to elucidate this point",
    "we determine the theoretical values of cnm factor ( @xmath136 ) .",
    "we have plotted the values of @xmath129 in fig .",
    "1 and we believe this will provide a guideline for the experimentalists to test this prediction .    fig .",
    "2 demonstrates the variation of @xmath137 with respect to @xmath12 as obtained from our model with dissociation temperatures of set i. we also show comparison of our results with the @xmath135 of @xmath113 obtained by cms experiment  @xcite .",
    "we again observe that the results are in fair agreement with the @xmath135 data of @xmath113 at least for pheripheral collisions . however , there is indication of cnm effect playing a role on the survival probability of @xmath113 for central collsions .",
    "the overall suppression of @xmath113 at all centralities is more than the @xmath13 state as expected from the basic mechanism of debye screening of colour charges .",

    "3 shows the variation of @xmath138 with respect to @xmath12 obtained in our model with set i. our results are quite in agreement with the experimental data of @xmath139 in pheripheral as well as most central collision .",
    "this confirms the finding that the ratio of the different upsilon state is very much free from cnm effects .",
    "however , a sizable difference in semi - central collisions outlines the importance of cnm on different upsilon states in these collisions . we have also plotted the variations of @xmath138 with respect to @xmath12 obtained in our model using dissociation temperatures of set ii .",
    "the results obtained from set ii show a large difference with the data and thus a large effect of cnm on @xmath138 is noticed .",
    "4 shows the variation of the ratio @xmath140 with respect to @xmath12 obtained in our model using dissociation temperatures as mentioned in set i and set ii of table ii .",
    "these results again suggest that the results with dissociation temperatures of set ii show anomalous features in semi - central as well as central collisions .",
    "thus set i is found to favourably describe the features of experimental data .    in fig . 5 ,",
    "we have presented our results for @xmath141 with respect to @xmath12 using both set i and ii . we also compare our results with the nuclear modification factor ( @xmath135 ) for @xmath142 obtained by rhic experiment  @xcite .",
    "our results with the dissociation temperatures as given in both sets match well with the experimental data .",
    "however , experimental data still favour more the results with set i. this study suggests that the effect of cnm on the @xmath142 at rhic energy is very small and the suppression of @xmath142 can be considered mainly due to sequential melting of upsilon states in qgp .    in fig .",
    "6 , we show our results for the variation of the survival probabilities of @xmath13 and @xmath113 with respect to @xmath20 using dissociation temperatures given by set i. fig .",
    "6 then illustrates how different @xmath20 ranges can affect the survival probabilities of @xmath1 states .",
    "we consider the most central collisions at the lhc energy in calculating the survival probabilities at various @xmath20 .",
    "we have also incorporated the feeddown from higher states .",
    "the survival probabilities of @xmath13 and @xmath113 both start from a small value ie . ,",
    "@xmath143 and @xmath144 , respectively at low @xmath20 and then increase with an increase in @xmath20 and get the values of @xmath145 and @xmath146 for @xmath13 and @xmath113 , respectively at @xmath147 gev .",
    "this again endorses the statement that upsilon states with large momentum can be formed at a later stage in the plasma rest frame .",
    "consequently the region covered by a hot plasma is reduced and hence less suppression for such large momentum upsilon states  @xcite . in other words , more upsilon states at large momentum",
    "should survive .    as shown in fig .",
    "6 , transverse momentum of @xmath5 pair has significant impact on the survival probability of upsilon .",
    "thus it is worthwhile to compare the survival probabilities of @xmath8 and @xmath9 calculated using different @xmath20-ranges . in fig .",
    "7 , we present variations of survival probabilities of @xmath8 and @xmath9 with respect to @xmath12 in two different momentum range .",
    "first momentum range ie . , @xmath148 gev is same as considered by cms collaboration at lhc .",
    "we compare the survival probabilities of @xmath8 and @xmath9 in this momentum range with the survival probabilities calculated in a low @xmath20 range ie .",
    ", for @xmath149 gev .",
    "these survival probabilities calculated in a low @xmath20 range might be measurable at detectors other than the cms experiment in future .",
    "this study again confirms that upsilon states with large momentum are less suppressed in comparison to low @xmath20 upsilon states at the same centrality .    in summary",
    ", we have presented here a modified colour - screening model for precise determination of the suppression of various @xmath1 states in qgp medium where we have used a quasi - particle model ( qpm ) equation of state for qgp and feed down from higher resonance states ( namely , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 ) .",
    "we have further used the concept of dilated formation time for quarkonia states under consideration and viscous effects of the qgp medium was additionally used .",
    "we find that the studies of interactions of heavy quarks such as charm and bottom with qgp play a dominant role in enhancing our understanding regarding the properties of the qgp medium .",
    "since these heavy quarks are dominantly produced by gluon - fusion in the early stages of the collision , they naturally experience the complete evolution of the system .",
    "we find that the mechanism of the modified colour screening proposed here explains the charmonia and bottomonia suppressions in the qgp medium in a unified way in the entire wide range of energy .",
    "thus we conclude that the theoretical studies regarding quarkonia ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) productions and their quantitative comparisons with the existing experimental data obtained for different colliding systems , collision energies and centralities can be used as a guiding factor in disentangling the interplay of various mechanism regarding the effects of the medium properties .",

    "<S> recently we have presented a modified colour screening model for @xmath0 suppression in the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) using quasiparticle model as the equation of state . in this paper , we extend our model to calculate the anomalous suppression of various states of @xmath1 arising due to qgp medium alone . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the suppression patterns of the different bottomonia states with respect to centrality at various available collision energies and compare them with the available experimental data . </S>",
