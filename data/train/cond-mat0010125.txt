    "a variety phenomena in physics and other fields can be modeled as brownian motion in an external periodic potential @xcite .",
    "one of particular example , the surface diffusion of atoms or small clusters , is of great fundamental and technological interest @xcite . during crystal growth the deposited atoms diffuse over the surface until they become incorporated in the lattice . on the semiconductor si(100 ) or ge(100 ) surface , most of the deposited si or ge atoms combine to form dimers , and the diffusion of such dimers has recently been studied experimentally by a scanning tunneling microscope @xcite .",
    "moreover , atoms adsorbed on metal surfaces in some cases form closely packed islands which diffuse as a whole @xcite .    theoretically the problem of diffusion can be described by a langevin equation for the atom(s ) or , equivalently , a fokker - planck - kramers equation for the distribution function in the phase space @xcite . in the trivial case of brownian motion without the external potential , the diffusion coefficient is equal to @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath4 is the temperature , @xmath5 is the particle mass , and @xmath6 is the viscous damping coefficient which models the energy exchange with the substrate ( thermostat ) . for a single atom in the one - dimensional ( 1d ) sinusoidal external ( substrate )",
    "potential the value of diffusion coefficient is well known as summarized in the risken monograph @xcite .",
    "exact results exist for the overdamped ( smoluchowski ) case , @xmath7 , when @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the ( total ) height of the substrate potential and @xmath11 is the modified bessel function , and in the underdamped limit , @xmath12 , when @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the complete elliptic integral of second kind . at low temperatures , @xmath17 , both expressions ( [ dhf ] ) and ( [ dlf ] )",
    "take the arrhenius form , @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 in the high - friction case [ here @xmath21 is the period of the substrate potential and @xmath22 is the frequency of oscillation at its minimum ] , and @xmath23 in the low - friction limit . in a general case",
    "the diffusion coefficient can be found numerically with practically any desired accuracy by the matrix continued - fraction - expansion method @xcite .    at low temperatures , @xmath17 , when the diffusion proceeds by uncorrelated thermally activated jumps over the barrier from one minimum of the external potential to another , the diffusion coefficient may be presented as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the rate of escape from a minimum of the external potential and @xmath26 is the mean - square jump length . for a moderate or large damping , @xmath27 , when only jumps for one period @xmath21 of the external potential",
    "are possible , one should take @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the escape rate given by the transition state theory ( tst ) @xcite , and the factor @xmath31 with @xmath32 provides an interpolation between the tst and overdamped limits as was found by kramers @xcite [ here @xmath33 is the `` saddle '' frequency at the saddle point @xmath34 , near which the external potential has the form @xmath35 ; for the sinusoidal potential @xmath36",
    ". the underdamped limit , @xmath37 , is qualitatively different : in this case @xmath38 as was found firstly by kramers @xcite , but the average jump length diverges as @xmath39 , thus this again leads to the dependence @xmath40 similarly to the overdamped case . the occurrence of long jumps , @xmath41 , has been observed in a number of experiments on surface diffusion @xcite .",
    "the interval from low to moderate friction is covered by the melnikov - meshkov formula @xcite @xmath42 } { u^2 + \\frac{1}{4 } } \\right ) , \\label{}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 .",
    "thus , the whole interval of frictions may be described by the interpolation formula @xmath44 , which was checked numerically in @xcite . combining this expression for @xmath45 with the numerically calculated values of @xmath46 , one can find the distribution of jump lengths @xcite .",
    "note that the widely used tst expression @xmath47 , where the diffusion coefficient does not depend on the damping coefficient , operates in fact for a narrow interval of frictions close to the point @xmath48 only ( which , fortunately , often corresponds to experimental situations ) .",
    "although the described above results for one - dimensional diffusion are very important and often lead to reasonable estimations for experimentally measured diffusion coefficients , in real systems the motion always takes place in a @xmath49 configurational space . indeed , even for diffusion of a single atom adsorbed on a crystal surface @xmath50 at least .",
    "besides , the diffusing object may have internal degrees of freedom .",
    "multi - dimensional effects modify both the escape rate @xmath45 and the jump length @xmath51 .",
    "the escape rate can be presented as @xmath52 , where the coefficient @xmath53 is known as the `` entropy factor '' @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath53 can be found with the help of transition state theory @xcite which yields @xmath54 , where @xmath55 are the frequencies at the minimum and @xmath56 are the `` saddle '' frequencies for all degrees of freedom @xmath57 except the given one along the diffusion path . in this approach @xmath53",
    "can be interpreted as @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the difference in entropy of the saddle and minimum - energy configurations .",
    "the entropy factor is often used to explain the `` compensation effect '' @xcite , when at experiment one observes that a decrease of the activation energy ( calculated as a slope of the arrhenius plot of @xmath60 versus @xmath61 ) is compensated by decreasing of the prefactor . as for the jump length , while for @xmath27 it still is given by @xmath62 , in the underdamped limit it is modified qualitatively comparing with the one - dimensional case . in the multi - dimensional space ,",
    "the path connecting adjoining minima of the external potential may not coincide with the direction of easy crossing at the saddle point .",
    "therefore , the probability of deactivation during long jumps is enhanced , leading to the reduction of jump length , @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "in particular , for the 2d - periodic substrate potential with the square symmetry it was found numerically @xcite that @xmath64 which gives @xmath65 .",
    "the multi - dimensional effects are also important in diffusion of molecules or small clusters : even for diffusion in the 1d periodic potential ( e.g. , along `` channels '' on furrowed or stepped surfaces ) one has for the dimer diffusion @xmath50 at least .",
    "diffusion of the dimer was studied numerically by vollmer @xcite with the help of matrix continued - fraction - expansion technique .",
    "the adiabatically slow motion of a linear molecule in the 1d sinusoidal potential was analyzed in @xcite , where the adiabatic trajectory was found for a general case .",
    "this allowed to find the activation barriers and the minimum - energy and saddle - state frequencies and then to estimate the diffusion coefficient .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to study the multi - dimensional effects in diffusion processes .",
    "we consider two typical examples : motion of a single atom in a `` channel '' which is periodic in one dimension and parabolic in others , and diffusion of a dimer ( two - atomic molecule ) in the 1d sinusoidal potential .",
    "we find an analytical solution for the overdamped case and analyze numerically the dependence of diffusion coefficient on the damping constant @xmath6 .",
    "the numerical results were obtained with the verlet algorithm by calculating the trajectory @xmath66 and then splitting it into @xmath67 pieces , each of the time duration @xmath68 .",
    "the diffusion coefficient was then calculated as @xmath69 .",

    "with temperature decreasing , the energy barriers and the entropy barriers play `` in phase '' for the `` narrow - barriers '' case of @xmath163 , and `` in antiphase '' for the `` wide - barriers '' case of @xmath164 . at low temperatures @xmath165 for the case of @xmath164 at high and moderate frictions in agreement with predictions of the tst approach .",
    "the effect , however , is smaller than the tst predicts : in simulation we found that the diffusion coefficient changes only in three times when the ratio of frequencies is equal to ten . at very low frictions ( e.g. , @xmath166 in fig .",
    "[ fig06 ] ) , the entropy barriers become more important than the energy barriers , and the diffusion coefficient again becomes smaller than the 1d one for all cases of @xmath167 as it was for the case of pure entropic barriers .",

    "thus , in the underdamped limit multi - dimensional effects lead to decreasing of diffusivity ( comparing with the 1d case ) due to reduction of jump length which scales as @xmath169 instead of the 1d scaling law @xmath170 .",
    "now we can study diffusion of a dimer in the 1d sinusoidal potential .",

    "the adiabatic trajectory for this system was studied in @xcite .",
    "its shape depends on a value of the elastic constant @xmath174 .",
    "the points @xmath189 , where @xmath190 is an integer , always correspond to the absolute minimum of the potential energy .",
    "near the minimum , the potential energy has the expansion @xmath191 with @xmath192 and @xmath193 . for a strong spring , @xmath194 ,",
    "there is only one saddle point at @xmath195 between two adjacent minima @xmath196 and @xmath197 .",

    "therefore , dimer diffusion can be approximately described as motion of one atom in the corrugated periodic potential with the transverse frequencies @xmath202 , i.e.  it corresponds to the case of `` wide '' barriers studied in the previous subsection .",
    "thus , although the shape of adiabatic trajectory does not depend on the elastic constant for the case of strong coupling , the diffusion coefficient does depend on @xmath174 , it increases when @xmath203 due to decreasing of the transverse curvature at the saddle point .",

    "the activation energy monotonically increases from the single - atom value @xmath178 at @xmath225 to the rigid - dimer value @xmath226 at @xmath206 and then remains constant .",
    "thus , one could expect that the diffusion coefficient should monotonically decrease with @xmath174 increasing . however , the simulation results of fig .  [ fig09 ] show that often this is not true .",
    "the peculiarity in the transverse frequencies at the point @xmath206 , where the saddle transverse frequency reaches zero , leads to a maximum of the function @xmath204 close to this point , if the damping is small , @xmath227 , and the temperature is not too low , @xmath228 ( recall @xmath229 ) .",
    "thus , multi - dimensional effects may strongly affect dimer s diffusivity .",
    "in the present paper we studied in details the diffusion of a particle in two - dimensional space which is periodic along @xmath71 and unbounded in the transverse direction .",
    "we calculated the entropy factor which emerges due to transverse degree of freedom , both in the overdamped limit ( analytically ) and in the underdamped case ( numerically ) , and compared it with the prediction of the transition - state theory .",
    "we showed that in the underdamped limit , the multi - dimensional effects lead to reduction ( comparing with the one - dimensional motion ) of jump lengths between subsequent trapping of the atom in bottoms of the external periodic potential .",
    "the simulation predicts that jump lengths scale as @xmath230 .",
    "this leads to a decrease of diffusivity which now scales as @xmath231 instead of the 1d dependence @xmath232 .    in the overdamped limit , the entropy factor ( and , therefore",
    ", the prefactor in the arrhenius formula for activated diffusion ) does not depend on temperature as long as the transverse motion near the adiabatic trajectory may be described by the harmonic approximation .",
    "simulation shows that this remains true , at least approximately , for low damping as well .",
    "thus , in most cases the experimentally observed dependence of the prefactor on temperature has to be attributed to collective effects due to interaction between diffusing particles or / and between the atom and ( deformable ) substrate .",
    "however , in the case of dimer diffusion at some value of the interaction between the atoms , when the saddle transverse frequency is equal zero , the anharmonicity of the transverse potential begins to play the important role and the entropy factor strongly depends on @xmath4 .",
