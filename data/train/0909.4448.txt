    "the tunability of the interparticle interaction on the basis of feshbach resonances , especially magnetic ones ( mfrs ) , marked a very important corner - stone in the research area of ultracold atomic gases . at ultracold energies s - wave scattering",
    "dominates the atom - atom interaction , such that for large internuclear distances the elastic scattering properties are solely described by the s - wave scattering length @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "its sign determines the type of interaction ( repulsive or attractive ) and its absolute value the interaction strength . in the presence of an mfr",
    "this parameter can be tuned at will by applying an external magnetic field",
    ". a wide range of experiments using mfr techniques has been carried out including the formation of cold , even bose - einstein condensed molecules  @xcite or the realization of a mott insulator phase with atoms in an optical lattice ( ol ) @xcite .",
    "experiments with ultracold gases are usually performed in external trapping potentials and over an ensemble of many particles . for tight trapping conditions",
    "the influence of the additional potential can become essential .",
    "for example , processes of molecule formation via photoassociation ( pa ) where two ultracold atoms absorb a photon and form a bound excited molecule  @xcite can be more efficient , if performed under tight trapping conditions as they are accessible in ols  @xcite .",
    "however , the presence of a trapping potential or , worse , the existence of many - body effects is a great challenge for the full theoretical description of an mfr , since all accessible spin configurations of the colliding atoms must be included , leading to a multi - channel ( mc ) problem . for the case of s - wave scattering of two free atoms the separation in relative and center - of - mass motions , the formulation in spherical coordinates , and the continuous energy spectrum make the numerical solution manageable",
    "this changes , unfortunately , if an external potential couples the six spatial coordinates of the two colliding atoms and induces the need to find discrete eigenenergies  @xcite .",
    "this can be the case for atoms loaded in a cubic ol formed with the aid of standing light waves  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the theoretical microscopic investigation of ultracold many - body systems is feasible only within the framework of the sc approximation .",
    "nevertheless , a good knowledge of two - body mc collisions should help in understanding the consequences of sc approximations which must be done when many - body systems are considered .",
    "single - channel ( sc ) approximations allowed to study the influence of the scattering length as it results from an mfr for three - body collisions @xcite and in the presence of an external trap @xcite . however , to our knowledge it is not yet well established to what extent sc approximations describe correctly the behavior of a coupled mc system , if more than one channel contributes significantly .",
    "the successful usage of ( sc ) pseudo - potentials to model , , the atom - atom interaction in ols  @xcite shows that physical properties depending on the long - range behavior of the open - channel scattering wave function , , the scattering length @xmath3 , are well described within the sc framework . for shorter interatomic distances in the order of the van der waals length scale @xmath4 ( @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the reduced mass and",
    "@xmath7 is the van der waals coefficient ) this is not necessarily the case . here",
    ", all coupled channels contribute to the full wave function and affect processes , such as transitions to molecular bound states .",
    "for these distances , sc approximations can not cover all details of the mc solution .",
    "as will be shown , some important aspects are , nevertheless , reflected and can be used to study processes of molecule formation in the presence of an mfr where mc calculations may be too laborious .",
    "a very systematic investigation of both short - range and long - range parts of the mc solutions against various sc ones is considered that is done in this work .",
    "the formation of ultracold molecules especially in deeply bound levels is currently of large interest . in order to associate them ,",
    "the starting point is often a sample of feshbach molecules , obtained from ultracold atoms via a sweep of the magnetic field around an mfr  @xcite .",
    "these molecules are usually formed in high lying vibrational ground states .",
    "molecules in lower vibrational states and eventually in the absolute vibrational ground state are , however , favorable since they are more stable against inelastic collisions .",
    "the most successful scheme to access those molecules is the two - color stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap )  @xcite when the passage is realized using pa via an intermediate excited state .",
    "the dump photoassociation ( dpa ) process during which two ultracold atoms absorb a photon and form directly a ground molecule is in principle possible for heteronuclear systems , although the yield is very small .",
    "it has been shown theoretically and for some cases even experimentally , that the pa and dpa yields can be significantly increased in the presence of an mfr  @xcite .",
    "for example in  @xcite it was found that an sc scheme based on mass variation predicts the same enhancement of the pa rate for almost all final states except the very high - lying ones and the ones at the pa window ( for @xmath8 ) .",
    "the reason for the enhancement was the increase of the absolute value for the initial - state wave function that occurs for large absolute values of @xmath3 .",
    "as a consequence the corresponding franck - condon ( fc ) factors and pa yields increase with @xmath9 ( see sec.iii,g of  @xcite for details ) .",
    "noteworthy , a strong enhancement of the pa rate by at least two orders of magnitude while scanning over an mfr was predicted on the basis of a mc calculation for a specific @xmath10rb resonance already in  @xcite .",
    "the explanation for the enhancement given in  @xcite is , however , based on an increased admixture of a bound - state contribution to the initial continuum state in the vicinity of the resonance .",
    "this is evidently different from the reason for the enhancement due to large values of @xmath9 discussed in  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that both seemingly different systems appear exhibit a strong correspondence .",
    "one of the motivations of the present work is to clarify this observation .    to mimic certain aspects of the mc wave function for studying molecular processes ,",
    "sc approaches make use of a controlled tuning of system parameters such as the reduced mass  @xcite , van der waals coefficients  @xcite , inner wall  @xcite of the interaction potential or the interaction potential in the intermediate range as is proposed in this work .",
    "long - range scattering properties like the s - wave scattering length can be sensitive to even small changes of those parameters . to date , the justification of these systematical variations is mainly given by the broad variety of atomic species and their isotopes , each with different parameter values . in this work",
    "it will be shown that by these variational approaches one is also able to reproduce changes of both long and short range collision properties of a given scattering system as it is induced by an external magnetic field in the proximity of an mfr .",
    "the general validity of the sc methods will be based on a two - channel ( tc ) approximation of the mfr  @xcite .",
    "this approximation is widely used to describe the phenomenon of an mfr and has been adopted to study many - body interactions @xcite and two - atom interaction in a time - dependent magnetic field @xcite and in a structured continuum induced by an ol @xcite .",
    "the tc approximation reproduces many aspects of the coupled mc system .",
    "it allows to describe the complex pa transition process by just two free parameters , the maximal transition rate and the position of the minimal transition rate @xcite .",
    "an analysis of the tc approximation reveals why sc approaches can show an astonishing conformance with the coupled mc predictions .    in order to compare concrete mc and sc solutions the exemplary case of @xmath11li and @xmath12rb scattering",
    "is considered and the relative motion of this system in a static magnetic field @xmath2 is fully solved employing the @xmath13-matrix method  @xcite .",
    "this system is of great importance by itself for its large static dipole moment , which makes it interesting for applications in quantum information processing  @xcite or the exploration of lattices of dipolar molecules  @xcite .",
    "the applicability of the different sc approaches is studied by considering the process of molecule formation by a direct pa of @xmath11li-@xmath12rb to the absolute vibrational ground state in the presence of an mfr .",
    "we describe this process by using the exact mc solution and compare to different sc approximations .",

    "the differences mainly originate from a shift of the minimal transition rates of the sc approaches compared to the mc result . in the mc case",
    "the minimum lies at @xmath163 close to the background scattering length @xmath164 in accordance with the tc approximation .",
    "the minima of the sc approaches tend to be situated on the positive side around @xmath165 .",
    "this is , however , not a general trend , since we observed for other transitions also minimal sc transition rates at negative scattering lengths .",
    "the location of the minimum depends on a system under investigation and on the applied sc variation .",
    "figure  [ fig : comp_rate_sc_mc](a ) features two kinks of the transition rate at @xmath166 for the @xmath112 and @xmath6 variations .",
    "this can be explained by the shift of the nodes of the sc wave functions which takes place at the equilibrium distance of the bound molecule and therefore influences the pa rate . since the variation parameters are tuned around their resonance value , with increasing distance from the resonance both left and right of it , eventually the same scattering length is induced ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : aswf ] ) .",
    "however , the nodal structure of @xmath114 and @xmath167 for short ranges can differ , leading to different transition rates . this does not occur for the @xmath7 and @xmath116 variations that act far beyond the equilibrium distance .",

    "the generality of our considerations is also supported by calculations of the dumping rate to the vibrational ground state of the triplet configuration @xmath130 . in all cases",
    "the sc approaches showed a comparable ability to reflect results of the mc system .",
    "it is also interesting to note that results of the @xmath169 analysis show that neither the details of the interatomic nor magnetic - field interactions are relevant for the calculation of the relative rate .",
    "a simple sc model turns out to be adequate to calculate the relative enhancement of the pa process .",
    "furthermore , in view of the important question of how to optimize the efficiency of dpa , fig .",
    "[ fig : comp_rate_sc_mc ] reveals once more that the use of a large absolute value of the scattering length is favorable .",
    "as already mentioned , sc resonances are evoked by artificially shifting the least bound state or a virtual state across the threshold . by turning a bound state into a virtual state or vice versa , the total number of bound states @xmath170 changes necessarily .",
    "this can be avoided by stopping the variation just before the bound or virtual states reach the threshold .",

    "furthermore , large values of the scattering length can be obtained by slight modifications of the sc hamiltonian . by fixing @xmath170",
    ", one has to stay on the same branch of the resonant curve @xmath178 .",
    "this modifies the sc hamiltonian strongly and can lead to a sudden change of the relative rate by some 30% as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rate_branches](b ) .",
    "the reason for the sudden change of the wave function is twofold . in all cases the asymptotic behavior of the wave functions",
    "are the same at different resonant points corresponding the same @xmath3 , but different hamiltonians lead to a slightly different continuation of the wave function towards smaller distances . if the variation takes place at ranges larger than the equilibrium distance @xmath179 ( @xmath180 and @xmath6 variation ) , the wave function around @xmath179 where it influences directly the transition rate can differ slightly in amplitude .",
    "secondly , if the variation takes place around @xmath179 ( @xmath112 and @xmath6 variation ) the nodal structure of the sc wave functions differs for both resonant sc parameters , since the necessary phase shift is acquired in different ways .",
    "both effects induce a `` step '' in the transition rate at @xmath181 as is visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : rate_branches](b ) .",
    "the nodal shift can in principle change the transition rate more strongly than in the present case .",
    "figure  [ fig : aswf](b ) compares the two wave functions of the @xmath6 variation at different resonant @xmath101 parameters .",
    "one can observe around @xmath182 both effects just described : the change of amplitude and the change of the nodal structure for different resonant variation parameters .    to conclude , in order to calculate relative pa rates it should be in most cases preferable not to keep the number of bound states fixed and to avoid a sudden change of the sc scattering wave function while going over the resonance .",
    "the drawback is of course a sudden change of the wave function for small scattering lengths .",
    "but here the sc approaches show in any way differences to the mc result , such as a shift of the minimal transition rate along the @xmath3 axis ( fig .",
    "[ fig : comp_rate_sc_mc](a ) ) .",
    "noteworthy , for the energy spectrum analysis , as it was done , , in  @xcite for two atoms in an ol , it is more convenient to stay on the same sc resonant branch . the alternative variation with non - constant @xmath170 does not influence the resulting energy spectrum .",
    "however , the disadvantage is that the numbering of the discrete levels should be changed across a sc resonance .",
    "we presented single - channel approaches that were able to reproduce both the long - range behavior of the open channel as well as the nodal structure and relative enhancement of any singlet or triplet state of a multi - channel system in the presence of a magnetic feshbach resonance .",
    "however , single - channel variations induce a shift of the nodal structure not present in the multi - channel solution .",
    "furthermore , the overall amplitude of the wave function stemming from the asymptotical behavior can be slightly modulated by long and intermediate - range variations .",
    "the @xmath116 variation , introduced in this work , showed to reproduce the corresponding multi - channel components at short and long interatomic distances most accurately .    as was demonstrated for the exemplary case of @xmath11li-@xmath12rb scattering single - channel wave functions",
    "can be used to study processes of molecule formation .",
    "we examined the specific process of a direct one - photon photoassociation to the absolute vibrational ground state of @xmath11li-@xmath12rb and proved the applicability of the single - channel approaches to model this process .",
    "the effects of the nodal shift and the modulation of the amplitude lead to a discontinuity in the transition rate for either small scattering lengths , if varying the single - channel hamiltonian over a resonance , or at large scattering lengths , if keeping the number of bound states constant .",
    "as was discussed , a variation around a resonance of the single - channel hamiltonian is preferable , since the point of minimal transition at small scattering lengths deviates in any way between multi - channel and single - channel results .",
    "these deviations appear , however , at scattering lengths where the transition rate is negligible compared to the one at resonance .",
    "the general applicability of single - channel approaches was based on the two - channel approximation which reveals that the scaling of the open - channel wave function and the admixture of closed channels depends on the scattering length in a similar way .",
    "additionally , by the help of this approximation one is able to reproduce exactly the multi - channel transition rate by adjusting two free parameters , that combine all details of the transition process .",
    "we can conclude that single - channel approaches are a suitable starting ground to study molecular processes in regimes were full multi - channel calculations are too laborious .",
    "this is , , the case , if the scattering takes place in an external trapping potential like an optical lattice , that in general couples relative and center - of - mass motions and spoils the spherical symmetry . in most cases the trapping potential does not directly influence the scattering wave function at short interatomic distances , but it induces an additional modulation of the amplitude as a function of the scattering length .",
    "the examination of effects due to these modulations are perfect candidates for the use of single - channel approaches .    since the nodal structure of either the singlet or the triplet components of the multi - channel wave function is reproduced by single - channel approximations , also more complicated photoassociation schemes , exciting a range of higher vibrational states , can be examined in the presence of a trapping potential .",
    "furthermore , single - channel approaches allow to treat three and many - body collisions with reasonable numerical efforts in the presence of a magnetic feshbach resonance .    of course , the presented single - channel approaches have also clear restrictions .",
    "for example , one has to assume that the scattering energy and the background scattering length are sufficiently small .",
    "this condition can be spoiled for certain atomic systems and in deep external trapping potentials with significantly large ground state energy .",
    "another problem can be caused by the energy dependence of the scattering length especially for narrow feshbach resonances .",
    "this energy dependence is not reflected by the current approaches .",
    "furthermore , the multi - channel wave function might behave differently compared to the single - channel one , if an energy variation is induced by , , ramping up an external trap .",
    "there exist single - channel approaches , which account for the energy dependence of the scattering length by a well - barrier pseudo - potential @xcite .",
    "however , like any pseudo potential it is unable to reflect the nodal structure of the scattering wave function at small internuclear distances .    recently deiglmayr observed for @xmath183li-@xmath184cs ( at @xmath185 ) the exceptional case of a strong deviation of molecular channel functions from pure singlet or triplet behavior at small internuclear distances @xcite .",
    "since spin - orbit coupling was neglected , they attributed this unusual effect to strong hyperfine coupling but gave no reason , why this happens specifically for the considered system .",
    "it is certainly interesting to further investigate this effect which would limit the applicability of single - channel wave functions to predict , , the relative transition rates to different vibrational levels .",
    "apart from this unusual behavior it should be possible from the theoretical considerations presented in this work to determine , whether and which single - channel approach is applicable for a specific system and molecular process .",
