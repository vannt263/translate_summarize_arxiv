    "the number , luminosity or mass of the entire globular cluster ( gc ) system normalized to the host galaxy luminosity or mass defines the fundamental quantities specific frequency ( @xmath3 ) , luminosity ( @xmath0 ) , specific mass ( @xmath4 ) and specific number ( @xmath5 ) of gcs ( cf .",
    "eqns [ eqn : sn ] ) .",
    "these gc scaling relations indicate how efficiently galaxies form gcs per unit of their luminosity or mass .",
    "those has been observed to vary significantly , being high for dwarf and giant galaxies ( @xcite ) , and with a minimum at a galaxy luminosity of @xmath6mag ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "that is , the two extreme galaxy mass regimes , dwarfs and giants , seemingly form old gcs in similar proportions .",
    "this scaling relations provide important observational constraints and test for models of star , gc and galaxy formation ( @xcite ) .",
    "in georgiev et al.(2010 ) , we investigate this trend with observations of gc populations of a large sample late - type dwarf galaxies with hst / acs ( @xcite ) . in order to sample the entire range in galaxy mass , environment , and morphology",
    "we augment our sample with data with data from the literature .",
    "we find that @xmath8 relations between the gcs scaling parameters and galaxy luminosity holds irrespective of galaxy morphological type and @xmath9 on average , early - type galaxies have @xmath10 higher @xmath0-values than late - types at the same luminosity . to investigate the observed trends , which have not yet been conclusively explained , we derive theoretical predictions of gc system scaling parameters as a function of the total host galaxy mass based on the models of dekel@xmath11brinboim ( 2006 ) in which star - formation processes ( i.e. thermal properties of the gas ) are regulated by stellar / supernova feedback below a stellar mass of @xmath12 , and by virial shocks ( hot stream ) above it , causing a suppression of star formation .",
    "specific frequency and luminosity @xmath13 can be related to the galaxy halo mass by defining the gc formation efficiency : @xmath14 .",
    "dekel & birnboim ( 2006 ) model predicts @xmath15 below and @xmath16 above galaxy stellar mass @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 where @xmath19 are observationally derived normalization constants , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the typical gc mass and mass - to - light ratio .",
    "the functional relations ( eqs [ eqn : snn ] ) describe remarkably well the observed distributions ( fig.[fig:2 ] ) .",
    "this supports that gcs form in proportion to the strength of the host potential ( galaxy mass ) as well as the effect on the gc formation efficiency by the physical mechanisms in the dekel & birnboim model of galaxy evolution ( thermal properties , shock stability and cooling physics of gas due to feedback from sne , uv on dust , photoionization , agn and dynamical friction ) .",
    "therefore , this model is a good representation of the gc formation efficiency ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "a better model should , in addition , take into account variations in the individual galaxy star formation history , merging history , conditions for cluster formation and destruction and the stochastic nature of star formation at low galaxy mass . observations of gcss of late - type , spiral galaxies in the high galaxy mass regime are necessary to probe whether their gc formation efficiencies are statistically different than that of early - type galaxies at same galaxy mass .",
