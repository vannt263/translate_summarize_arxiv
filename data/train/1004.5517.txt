    "therefore the total complexity of our 2.5-approximation algorithm for the @xmath0-mmn problem is @xmath335    the following simple idea allows to reduce the contribution of each staircase @xmath249 to @xmath258 instead of @xmath336 leading to a total complexity of @xmath337 first , note that among all @xmath331 subproblems , whose optima are stored in the dynamic programming table , only @xmath329 are affected by the choice of the @xmath254 ( those are the subproblems containing the highest and the rightmost terminal of @xmath193 ) . therefore , instead of solving each of @xmath331 subproblems @xmath329 times , we solve the subproblems not affected by the choice of @xmath254 only once .",
