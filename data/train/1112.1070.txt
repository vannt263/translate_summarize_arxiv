    "in monolayer graphene , the hexagonal arrangement of carbon atoms dictates that in the absence of atomic - scale disorder , graphene is a gapless semiconductor@xcite that is always metallic at low temperature.@xcite this metallic behavior holds even in the presence of quantum interference and strong disorder,@xcite in stark contrast to most other materials , which undergo a metal - to - insulator transition at low carrier density.@xcite the physical origin for this robust metallic state is that the ground - state of graphene at vanishing mean carrier density becomes spatially inhomogeneous , breaking up into electron - rich and hole - rich metallic regions connected by highly conducting p - n junctions.@xcite bilayer graphene comprising two sheets of graphene that become strongly coupled due to the @xmath0 stacking arrangement@xcite shares some properties with regular semiconductors ( such as the parabolic band dispersion ) and in other ways behaves like monolayer graphene , including having chiral wavefunctions and forming electron and hole puddles at low density .",
    "these electron and hole puddles have now been observed in several experiments of exfoliated graphene on an insulating sio@xmath1 substrate including refs .  .",
    "while these authors suggest that long - range charged impurities in the substrate could be responsible for the spatial inhomogeneity , detailed comparisons to microscopic models have not been made .    in this paper , we demonstrate that differences between the spatial properties of puddles in monolayer and bilayer graphene can be quantitatively explained by the differences in the screening properties of the two systems ( that ultimately arises from the differences in their band - structure ) .",
    "numerical results show that the correlation length for bilayer graphene is relatively independent of density and significantly smaller than that of monolayer graphene for a typical range of impurity densities .",
    "finally , we find good quantitative agreement when comparing our results with available experimental data .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : formalism ] , we outline the the theoretical model , providing a heuristic understanding of our results using the thomas - fermi ( tf ) screening theory",
    ". however , the tf significantly underestimates the effect of electronic screening in both monolayer and bilayer graphene .",
    "it is therefore necessary to use the random phase approximation ( rpa ) screening theory , which we discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : rpa ] .",
    "our main finding is that the puddle correlation length in bilayer graphene @xmath2 is relatively insensitive to the impurity concentration and carrier doping .",
    "this is in contrast to monolayer graphene , where the puddle correlation length varies from @xmath3 in dirty samples to more than @xmath4 in clean samples .",
    "the comparison with experiment is done in sec .",
    "[ sec : compare ] , where we examine three different experimental results : ( 1 ) we consider first the experimentally determined normalized correlation function @xmath5 ( see definition below ) obtained from the scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) data reported for exfoliated bilayer graphene in ref .  .",
    "the full functional form of @xmath5 agrees with the theory where the only adjusted parameter in the theory is the distance @xmath6 of the impurities from the graphene sheet .",
    "in particular the experimentally determined correlation length @xmath7 , defined here as the half - width at half - maximum ( hwhm ) decay length of @xmath5 agrees well with the @xmath8 rpa theory value of @xmath9 .",
    "this value of @xmath6 is both reasonable and consistent with those determined from other transport measurements on bilayer graphene.@xcite ( 2 ) from the monolayer graphene stm experimental data reported in ref .",
    ", we extract a correlation length @xmath10 .",
    "since the measurements  @xcite were made on the same exfoliated graphene sample containing both single layer and bilayer graphene regions , we expect that the extrinsic disorder potential is statistically identical for the two samples .",
    "therefore , using the value of @xmath8 ( discussed above ) and the disorder induced dirac point shift reported in ref .  , we calculate theoretically ( without any adjustable parameters ) that a monolayer graphene sample in the same disorder environment would have a puddle correlation length @xmath11 , in reasonable agreement with the experiment .",
    "( 3 ) we then compare @xmath5 obtained using scanning coulomb blockade spectroscopy reported in ref .   with our theoretical results for monolayer graphene at the dirac point .",
    "the parameters used in the theory were obtained from separate transport measurements on the same experimental sample.@xcite the agreement between theory and experiment is remarkable since it involves no adjustable parameters . finally in sec .  [",
    "sec : conclude ] , we conclude by making predictions for future experiments involving monolayer and bilayer graphene on bn substrates .",
    "the doping level of graphene can be measured in a variety of different ways . in transport measurements , the gate voltage potential that yields the resistivity maximum identifies the extrinsic doping level due to extraneous sources , such as charged impurities in the substrate impurities with density , @xmath12 . while the width of the resistivity maximum is a measure of the homogeneity of the sample ,  @xcite or the electron - hole puddle distribution .    in local probe measurements , such as stm , the dirac point energy relative to the fermi - level",

    "we can also characterize the puddles through the radially averaged autocorrelation function @xmath17 where the angular brackets denote an average over the image area and the @xmath18-integration averages over orientations .",

    "consider the thomas - fermi ( tf ) screening for which the surface dielectric function is given by @xmath32 , where @xmath33 ( discussed below ) is the thomas - fermi screening wavevector .",

    "on the other - hand , the function @xmath22 ( which , within the tf can be calculated analytically ) depends on @xmath24 , @xmath28 , @xmath6 and @xmath34 .",
