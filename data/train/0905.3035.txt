    "recently , the studies of cold atoms in optical lattices are extensively developed .",
    "optical lattices are crystals made of light periodic potentials that confine ultracold atoms@xcite . because of their precise control over the system parameters and defect - free properties , ultracold atoms in optical lattices provide an ideal platform to study many interesting physics in condensed matters@xcite and even high energy physics@xcite .",
    "very recently , a strong interest has been raised in the two - dimensional honeycomb lattice @xcite , for its physics is closely related to that of the graphene material@xcite , which has surprisingly rich collective behaviors . with the tight - binding approximation",
    ", graphene has a linear dispersion relation resembling the dirac spectrum for massless fermions . in the presence of a magnetic field , it has the landau energy level with square - root dependence on the quantum number @xmath0 , instead of the usual linear dependence .",
    "in particular , the zero - energy landau level exists at @xmath1 , which is a direct result of chirality .",
    "recently , mccann _",
    "et al_. have studied the electronic states and unconventional landau levels of the bilayer graphene arranged according to bernal stacking@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the eigenstates and spectrum of ultracold fermions in the bilayer honeycomb optical lattice with a different stacking order from that in reference @xcite . in the absence of an effective magnetic field ,",
    "the dispersion relation has parabolic form and the quasiparticles are still chiral like that in the monolayer system . in the presence of an effective magnetic field , which can be built by coupling the internal states(spin ) of atoms to spatially varying laser beams @xcite",
    ", the spectrum shows an unconventional landau level structure .",
    "the experimental detection of the spectrum is proposed with the bragg scattering techniques .",
    "we consider a system of ultracold fermions confined in the bilayer honeycomb lattice .",
    "the honeycomb lattice consists of two sublattices denoted by @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "then , the bilayer honeycomb lattice considered in our work is formed by coupling the @xmath3 sublattices of the two layers with tunneling and leaving the @xmath2 sublattices of the two layers uncoupled .",
    "one can create the bilayer honeycomb lattice in the following steps .",
    "first , one builds the monolayer honeycomb lattice as shown in fig.[fig1 ] ( a ) with three laser beams in the @xmath4 plane and two laser beams along the @xmath5 direction@xcite .",
    "when the potential barrier of the optical lattice along the @xmath5 direction is high enough , the vertical tunneling between different planes is suppressed seriously , then every layer is an independent two - dimensional honeycomb lattice .",
    "secondly , one makes the triangular lattice as shown in fig.[fig1 ] ( b ) with red - detuning laser fields@xcite . finally , to realize the bilayer honeycomb lattice",
    ", one can put the triangular lattice and the honeycomb lattice together as shown in fig.[fig1 ] ( c ) .",
    "there exists an additional micro - trap between sublattices @xmath3 of every two layers in the honeycomb lattice .",
    "the additional micro - trap lowers the barrier between sublattices @xmath3 of these two layers in the honeycomb lattice , or links sublattices @xmath3 of these two layers in the honeycomb lattice as an intermediate point , so that sublattices @xmath3 of these two layers in the honeycomb lattice are coupled .",
    "following this scheme , many independent bilayer honeycomb lattices can be achieved ( see fig.[fig1 ] ( c ) ) , so we only need to investigated one of them . for convenience ,",
    "we assume that the whole system is trapped in a two - dimensional box , which can be achieved by adding four blue detuning endcap beams at the edges of the optical lattice in @xmath4 plane@xcite . with this box trap ,",
    "the system can be considered to have the hard wall boundary condition approximately , so we can neglect the boundary effect in our discussion .    in this scheme ,",
    "the ultracold atoms have a @xmath6-type three - level configuration , the states @xmath7 and @xmath8 are degenerate states , which are assumed to be different zeeman states on the same hyperfine level , and @xmath9 is an excited state . the ground state @xmath10 with @xmath11 and the excited state @xmath9 are coupled though two laser field with the corresponding rabi frequencies @xmath12 , respectively@xcite .",
    "the schematic representation of this scheme is as shown in fig .",
    "the total hamiltonian reads , @xmath13 .",

    ", the effective trap potential can approximately be written as @xmath45 which has an additional constant term compared with the original external trap potential .",
