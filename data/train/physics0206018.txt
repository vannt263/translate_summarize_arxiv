    "the boundary conditions at infinity are determined by the experimental situation . in a scattering experiment",
    "the wave function is composed of an incoming plane wave with wave vector @xmath11 and an outgoing scattered wave . the wave function has the asymptotic form ( in 2d ) @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the angle - dependent differential amplitude for elastic scattering . in lasers ,",
    "however , the radiation is generated within the cavity without incoming wave , @xmath15 this situation can be modelled by a dielectric cavity with complex - valued @xmath16 leading to steady - state solutions of the wave equation  ( [ eq : wave ] ) .",

    "the resonant states are connected to the peak structure in scattering spectra ; see  @xcite for an introduction .",

    "the wave equation  ( [ eq : wave ] ) with the outgoing - wave condition  ( [ eq : outgoingbc ] ) can be solved analytically by means of separation of variables only for special geometries , like the isolated circular cavity ( see e.g. ref .",
