    "in this work we present a derivation of the fixed center approximation to the faddeev equations for the @xmath0 system for the case when the @xmath4 system has total spin @xmath1 .",
    "the case for @xmath5 was done in @xcite for @xmath6 at threshold and extended to values below threshold to find a quasibound state in @xcite . an earlier version for @xmath7",
    "was done in @xcite but ignored charge exchange processes in the multiple scattering of the kaons .",
    "the improved results of @xcite for @xmath8 provided a binding of about 12 mev smaller than ignoring the charge exchange processes and was worth being taken into consideration .",
    "the resulting binding was 9 mev with a width of 30 mev . yet , a formula like the one of @xcite for the case of @xmath1 was never derived and one is left with some worry about what could be the effects of charge exchange processes in this latter case .",
    "this is the purpose of the present paper , where a simple derivation is presented and the new results are shown .",
    "the study of the bound @xmath0 system has been the center of much attention recently @xcite .",
    "earlier calculations on this system were already done in the 60 s @xcite and more recently in @xcite , yet , the works of @xcite improved considerably on these earlier works .",
    "two different methods have been used in those papers .",
    "those of refs .",
    "@xcite use faddeev equations , in the formulation of alt - grassberger - sandhas ( ags ) @xcite , using a separable interaction for the potentials with energy independent strength , and form factors depending on the three momenta .",
    "they include as coupled channels @xmath9 and @xmath10 , the basic ones in the study of the @xmath11 interaction in chiral unitary theories at low energies @xcite .",
    "on the other hand the works of @xcite use a variational method to obtain the binding energy and width , by means of an effective potential @xcite that leads to the strongly energy dependent @xmath12 amplitudes of the chiral unitary approach .",
    "this includes the @xmath13 channel integrated into the effective @xmath12 potential , but do not include the @xmath14 channel explicitly into the three body system . in table iv of @xcite one finds that there are 11 mev difference considering just one channel @xmath12 or the two channels @xmath12 and @xmath13 , both in the evaluation of the @xmath12 amplitude and in the @xmath15 system , finding more binding in the case of two channels .",
    "one should note that this is not to be compared with the approach of @xcite where the @xmath12 amplitude is always calculated with @xmath12 , @xmath13 and other coupled channels .",
    "one may argue that the consideration of @xmath13 in the two body system would account for most of the @xmath13 influence in the three body problem , a conjecture made by schick and gibson @xcite which was substantiated numerically in the work of ref .",
    "but this was only done at threshold of @xmath11 , so testing this at lower energies is worthwhile and we shall face this problem here too .",
    "the two faddeev approaches @xcite lead to binding energies higher than the variational approach , 50 - 70 mev versus around 20 mev binding respectively .",
    "the use of an energy independent kernel in the ags equations is partly responsible for the extra binding of these approaches with respect to the chiral calculations .",
    "the chiral potential is energy dependent , proportional to the sum of the two external meson energies in @xmath16 , and , as a consequence , one obtains a smaller @xmath16 amplitude at @xmath17 energies below threshold , resulting in a smaller binding for the @xmath18 system @xcite .",
    "this is also corroborated in the approach of @xcite when the energy dependence of the weinberg - tomozawa chiral potential is taken into account in @xcite .",
    "further discussions along this issue can be found in section 5 of @xcite .    yet , in most cases the widths are systematically larger than the binding energy , of the order of 70 - 100 mev , which makes the observation of these states problematic . a discussion on experimental work claiming to have found a @xmath19 bound state is made in section 5 of @xcite , together with the theoretical work that shows that the experimental peaks observed correspond to conventional mechanisms that have nothing to do with a new bound state .",
    "the approach of @xcite follows the chiral unitary approach for the @xmath20 amplitudes , which provide the most important source of the binding of the three body system .",
    "however , rather than looking for the binding , searching for poles in the complex plane or looking for the energy that minimizes the expectation value of the hamiltonian as the other approaches do , one looks for peaks in the scattering matrices as a function of the energy of the three body system .",
    "these amplitudes could in principle be used as input for final state interaction when evaluating cross sections in reactions where eventually this @xmath21 state is formed .",
    "we rely upon the results of @xcite which prove that only on shell two body amplitudes are needed to study the three body system . by this",
    "we mean the part of the analytical amplitudes obtained setting @xmath23 for the external particles , even if the particles are below threshold .    like in the other works",
    ", we also assume that the two body interactions proceed in l=0 .",
    "according to all the works , the main component of the wave function corresponds to having a @xmath24 in i=0 ( coupling strongly to the @xmath25 and hence the total isospin will be i=1/2 .",
    "the spin of the system for l=0 is provided by the two nucleons and all the works find that the most bound case corresponds to @xmath1 . since the @xmath5 case was studied in @xcite , here we concentrate in the @xmath1 case . since in our case @xmath26 corresponds to the total spin of the @xmath18 system we shall refer to @xmath27 in what follows .    in the fca",
    "the @xmath18 system is addressed by studying the interaction of a @xmath2 with a @xmath4 cluster .",
    "the scattering matrix for this system is evaluated as a function of the total energy of the @xmath18 system and one looks for peaks in @xmath28 . in a second step one",
    "allows explicitly the intermediate @xmath29 state in the three body system .",
    "a discussion of different approaches along the fca line is done in @xcite , where it is shown that some works do not take into account explicitly the charge exchange @xmath30 reactions and antisymmetry of the nucleons , but it is explicitly done in ref .",
    "@xcite . in @xcite charge exchange in the @xmath2 multiple scattering",
    "was also ignored , but in @xcite it was taken into account for the @xmath5 case , and a quasibound state was found with about 9 mev binding and a width of about 30 mev .",
    "technically we follow closely the formalism of @xcite , where the fca has been considered , using chiral amplitudes , in order to study theoretically the possibility of forming multi-@xmath31 states with large spin .",
    "the @xmath4 interaction is of long range and very strong .",
    "it binds the deuteron in spin @xmath5 and @xmath32 , with @xmath33 to a very good approximation .",
    "it nearly binds the @xmath34 system also .",
    "the binding of the @xmath34 system is so close that a little help from an extra interaction , the strongly attractive @xmath35 interaction , is enough to also bind this system and we shall assume that this is the case here for @xmath34 or in general for two nucleons in @xmath1 , @xmath36 , @xmath33 .",
    "the strategy followed in @xcite is to assume as a starting point that the @xmath4 cluster has a wave function like the one of the deuteron ( we omit the d - wave ) . later on one",
    "releases this assumption and assumes that the @xmath4 system is further compressed in the @xmath37 system . for this",
    "we rely upon the information on the @xmath4 radius in the @xmath37 molecule obtained in @xcite , where the @xmath4 interaction is taken into account including short range repulsion that precludes unreasonable compression .",
    "the r.m.s radius found is of the order of 2.2 fm , slightly above one half the value of the deuteron r.m.s radius of 3.98 fm ( @xmath4 distance ) .",
    "in order to evaluate the amplitude for the @xmath18 with @xmath1 , we follow the following strategy .",
    "\\1 ) we evaluate first the @xmath38 amplitude considering charge exchange processes in the rescattering of the kaons .",
    "the amplitude will contains total isospin @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "since we only want the @xmath39 , we evaluate the scattering amplitude for @xmath40 in addition , taking the @xmath41 amplitude , and from a linear combination of the two we obtain the @xmath39 amplitude .",
    "we have found that this strategy leads to a far simpler derivation than other methods that we have also tried .",
    "\\2 ) for the @xmath38 we define three partition functions ,    \\a ) @xmath42 , which contains all diagrams that begin with a @xmath43 collision with the first proton of the @xmath34 system and finish with @xmath44 .",

    "these amplitudes fulfill a set of coupled equations that are easy to see diagrammatically by looking at the diagrams of fig . [",

    "the @xmath13 channel and other coupled channels are explicitly taken into account in the consideration of the @xmath12 amplitude which we have used in the fca approach .",
    "this means that we account for the @xmath84 transition , and an intermediate @xmath83 channel , but this @xmath85 state is again reconverted to @xmath12 leaving the other @xmath86 as a spectator .",
    "this is accounted for in the multiple scattering in the @xmath87 scattering matrix on one nucleon .",
    "however , we do not consider the possibility that one has @xmath84 and the @xmath88 rescatters with the second nucleon . if we want to have a final @xmath21 system again , the @xmath88 has to scatter later with the @xmath89 to produce @xmath12 .",
    "one may consider multiple scatterings of the @xmath88 with the nucleons , but given the smallness of the @xmath90 amplitude compared to the @xmath12 , any diagram having more than one rescattering of the pion with the nucleon will be negligible .",

    "this is smaller than the 12 mev shift found in @xcite for the @xmath5 case .",
    "also , relatively , the change is more drastic in the @xmath5 case since there was a reduction of 12 mev from 21 mev , while here there is a reduction of 4 mev over a total of 32 mev binding .",

    "[ fig : s0 ] , [ fig : s0red ] is similar to the one of the @xmath111 , which already provides a peak in the total amplitude of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tknncharge ] ) at the single scattering level .",
    "the multiple scattering is responsible for an extra binding of about 25 mev and 10 mev increase in the width .",
    "alternatively , we can view the @xmath18 state as a bound @xmath112 state as suggested in @xcite . in this case fig .",
    "[ fig : kbarn ] could be interpreted as having a non interacting @xmath112 state , where the @xmath113 has been formed in the collision of the @xmath2 with one nucleon and the second one has been a spectator . then , the results of fig . [ fig : s0red ] , where the @xmath2 has reinteracted with the two nucleons , could be interpreted as a system where the @xmath113 has interacted with the second nucleon and a quasibound @xmath112 state is formed @xcite .",
    "we have done a derivation of the fca to the faddeev equations for the case of the @xmath18 system with @xmath1 , complementing what was already done in @xcite for the @xmath6 at threshold , extended below threshold in @xcite . with this new formula",
    "we evaluate the @xmath18 amplitude below the @xmath18 threshold and we find a clear peak of @xmath28 at about 3334 mev , reducing the former binding by about 6 mev , with a width of 50 mev .",
    "this is a moderate change with respect to the one found in @xcite ignoring the charge exchange processes , and also smaller than the effect found in @xcite for the @xmath5 , where the charge exchange processes was found quite important , reducing the binding of the @xmath18 with @xmath5 in about 12 mev .",
    "we have also shown that the explicit consideration of the @xmath3 state in the three body system is rather moderate , and goes in the direction of decreasing the binding by about 3 mev . in summary , here and",
    "in @xcite we have shown that the fca to the faddeev equations is a good tool which provides reasonable values for the binding and width of the @xmath18 system , corroborating qualitatively findings done with other methods which are technically much more involved .",
    "we find a binding for the @xmath18 system with @xmath1 of 35 mev with a width of 50 mev .",
    "this should be compared to the about 20 mev binding in @xcite and 16 mev in a recent paper @xcite using the same input as in @xcite .",
    "even with these differences , the binding obtained here is substantially smaller than other values quoted in the literature which did not use the chiral dynamical approach . as to what to attribute the difference with the results of @xcite , certainly there are approximations done in the fca .",
    "one of them , making a static picture of the two @xmath114 and using eq .",
    "( [ eq : argment ] ) , which relates the @xmath12 effective energy to the total energy , does not consider recoil of the nucleon .",
    "one can make some rough estimate of this effects as follows . since @xmath115 , with @xmath116 the total fourmomentum of the @xmath18 system ( @xmath117 ) , we would have @xmath118 and the first term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : yenis1 ] ) would correspond to the expression of eq .",
    "( [ eq : argment ] ) that neglects recoil .",
    "continuing with the rough approximation we can think that    @xmath119    with @xmath120 the binding energy of a single nucleon , where we have assumed the kinetic energy to be of the order of the binding energy and the binding energy of each particle proportional to its mass ( this is also implicit in eq .",
    "( [ eq : argment ] ) ( see @xcite ) ) .",
    "this correction results into a decrease of the binding of the @xmath1 state by about 8 mev , bringing the results closer those of @xcite .",
    "incidentally , the @xmath5 state reported in @xcite would reduce its binding by about 2 - 3 mev .",
    "on the other hand , the variational or faddeev approaches also have intrinsic uncertainties tied to the use of off - shell extrapolation of the amplitudes .",
    "to our knowledge there is only one work where the effects of these off - shell extrapolations has been studied in the three body system .",
    "this is the work of @xcite ( section v ) , which studies the @xmath121 system with faddeev equations , and the off - shell effects were shown to produce a shift of 40 mev in the energy of the @xmath122 resonance ( now called @xmath123 ) .",
    "one can make some guesses on what the effects could be in the present case .",
    "the amount of 40 mev over the excess energy of the @xmath123 over threshold of @xmath121 , 170 mev , is about 24 % .",
    "thus , the same proportion applied to the binding of the @xmath18 system found by us gives 8 mev .",
    "alternatively , we can look at the differences between different approaches using the same input to give us an idea of the possible effects .",
    "inspection of the results of @xcite tells us that the differences are of the order of 10 mev .",
    "thus , effects of the order of 10 mev from unphysical off - shell contributions are likely in the @xmath124 case . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath5 case of @xcite could be a privileged one in this sense , since applying the same percentage as before to the 9 mev binding found in @xcite , we find likely off - shell effects of the order of 2 mev .",
    "the findings for the @xmath5 in @xcite , with the uncertainties estimated here could be in agreement with the results for this case in @xcite , where the authors conclude that if there is a quasibound @xmath125 state it must be bound by less than about 11 mev .    within the uncertainties of the method , the simplicity of the present approach allows one to get an insight on the problems , following the analytical expressions of the amplitudes .",
    "ultimately , improvements on all these works could be done within the approach of @xcite , which one must encourage , which uses full faddeev equations in coupled channels and relies upon the on - shell t - matrices alone .",
