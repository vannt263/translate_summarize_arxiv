    "it has often been argued , and there is corroborating empirical evidence which suggests that stock market prices exhibit wave like properties  @xcite . in the classical financial mathematics",
    "there were performed fundamental investigations to find adequate stochastic processes matching the real financial data : brownian , geometric brownian , general levy processes .",
    "from the point of view of quantum - like approach the problem can not even be formulated in such a way .",
    "there is no any classical stochastic process which will match with the real financial data , because there is no a single kolmogorov space describing the whole financial market .",
    "the financial data can only be represented as a quantum - like financial process  @xcite .",
    "the instantaneous return on the financial times - stock exchange ( ftse ) and all share index is viewed as a frictionless particle moving in a one - dimensional square well ( potential barrier ) but where there is a non - trivial probability of the particle tunneling into the well s retaining walls with some prices uncertainty  @xcite .",
    "the potential barrier approach is frequently used for barrier option calculations in the stock market  @xcite .",
    "the wave like characteristic of the stock market prices gives rise to also quantum nash equilibrium to solvable games in the hilbert space  @xcite .",
    "combinatorial auctions on financial game theory seem to be the most promising field .",
    "the promising quantum like experiments give rise to commercial implementation of quantum auctions in near future  @xcite .",
    "the quantum model which gives surprisingly quantitative and transparent explanation of the observed shape and temporal stability of the observed stock price fluctuations on short time scales was developed in  @xcite . by including sufficiently many hidden variables stochastic models may be able to reproduce the historic observations with similar accuracy .",
    "indeed , the ( possible ) existence of hidden variables was at the heart of the early critique of quantum theory .",
    "it is almost self - evident that the return on a stock depends on many factors that have not been modelled .",
    "the question nevertheless is not just one of having a more efficient description of the dynamics . unlike hidden variables describing physical phenomena , the factors that influence the dynamics of a stock are expected to change over time .",
    "it furthermore is not clear how economic factors like the gross national product influence the value of any given stock at any given point in time .",
    "the observed scaling of the return distributions for various stocks in different economic environments strongly suggests that all these  hidden  factors find their expression in the mean return and the variance of the returns .",
    "the dynamics that determines the shape of the return distributions , on the other hand , must be self - consistent and largely immune to the influence of  hidden  variables that are specific to a company and the economic and political climate .",
    "hidden variables in our model is an analogy with hidden dimensions in string and brane theory , both are non - visible non - measurable but have a big influence on the whole system .",
    "the fluctuations in the real market are not gaussian @xcite unlike it does not decay as fast as gaussian , and the history shows that the catastrophic loss ( gain ) is more likely than the gaussian model ; therefore some attempt to define non - linear quantum like model were made in  @xcite .",
    "it was found in  @xcite that the space of financial events is a fibration endowed with a particular affine connection , so they are consequences of purely geometric properties .",
    "the curvature of manifolds is determined by the connection upon the fibration .",
    "the state space is considered as a smooth manifold the use of rieman metrics and connections . in this assumption , we rewrite the known pricing equations in terms of geometrical covariant quantities .",
    "we defined another type of geometrical object on financial market , which may live on riemannian manifolds , the spinor field .",
    "some quantum mechanical approach to the option pricing dynamics was firstly popular by described in  @xcite .",
    "the option prices in our model are represented by the electrons with mass @xmath0 , where sigma is volatility , as in work  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to other quantum models with ordinary particles  @xcite , we assume an electron with spin up and down which entitles us to use some relativistic approach .",
    "moreover , difference in spin orientation for one electron could play a key role in difference for up and down factors of increasing and decreasing option price in one step time interval of change price in discrete binomial and trinomial models  @xcite . in mathematical definitions ,",
    "the prices are represented via spinors as elements of spaces in which these representations act as matrices , so spinors will be ordinary real column vectors of prices in our model . with the concept of spin bundle the spin connection will be calculated where in terms of this connection spinors are parallel transported and covariantly differentiated .    it is clear that call and put prices are moving on hyperbolic curves  @xcite with a slope very similar to spherical curves in some cases . perhaps the simplest type of compactification leading to the existence of chiral fermions is related to orbifolds .",
    "consider a 3d space - time of the form @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is ( non - compact ) time , @xmath3 corresponds to large observable dimension with size @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) , and @xmath6 is a ( short ) interval corresponding to extra dimension ( @xmath7 ) , @xmath8 .",
    "we will describe the dynamics of the relativistic particle which decsribe in this model the price of the stock market by dirac equation  @xcite .",
    "the dirac equation @xmath9 for the 3-dimensional two - component fermions @xmath10 with ( t , x , z ) = (    [ cols= \" < \" , ]     ) , for @xmath11 . here",
    "@xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the bessel and modified bessel functions .",
    "the parameters @xmath15 are energy operator , arbitrage buble , interest rate ( radius of the sphere ) and @xmath16 ( projection of angular momentum ) could be an indicator of some trends of the stock market .",
    "similar results in the form of bessel functions for the stock market were found in  @xcite .",
    "for the operator energy in the case of disk stock market one can find @xmath17 .",
    "as was published many times , the black scholes model is good idealization of the financial market .",
    "it is known by referring to the experimental data published in many journals that the random walk model is a good approximation of the market reality in static situations or in a equilibrium state on the financial market .",
    "whenever such extra - ordinary events take place especially leading to financial and/or economical crisis , the random walk model fails .",
    "it means in the case of very big instability with very big volatility and fluctuation of prices that some other approaches need to be developed to describe and obtian real dynamics of such market panic behaviour .",
    "market equilibrium comes at the price of a commodity for balancing the market forces like demand & supply . in market equilibrium",
    "the amount that the buyers want to buy is equal to the amount that the sellers want to sell .",
    "the reason we call this equilibrium , when the forces of demand & supply are in balance , there is no reason for a price to rise or fall as long as other factors remain unchanged .",
    "a situation in which the supply of an item is exactly equal to its demand .",
    "since there is neither surplus nor shortage in the market , price tends to remain stable in this situation .",
    "equilibrium price is also called market clearing price because at this price the exact quantity that producers take to market will be bought by consumers , and there will be nothing ` left over ' . for markets to work ,",
    "an effective flow of information between buyer and seller is essential .",
    "the flow of information is described in our approach as a interaction part of the energy operator of market .",
    "the equilibrium market behaviour could be obtained with two possibilities in our model .",
    "the first one is that @xmath18 , it means that arbitrage posibilities compensate the energy of the market .",
    "for example , interactions between investors and markets are so stable that there are no any arbitrage possibitites .",
    "the second possibility is the case of ideal market behaviour when arbitrage posibilities are zero from the beginning @xmath19 , and for the ideal behaviour of the market the energy of the market needs to be @xmath20 .",
    "e.q . there are no any interactions between the market and traders , any changes in prices , any transaction costs are taken into account .",
    "this is exactly the case of the perfect market equilibrium postulated by the black scholes model .    in our approach of the stock market",
    "on a spherical manifold which is close connected into the topology of the spatial manifold itself the result is that there are not any possibilities for such ideal behaviour of market .",
    "it means that on the sphere does not exist any zero modes solutions any case of ideal market behaviour where @xmath20 as can be seen from eq.(35 ) and moreover this is a general property of manifolds with positive curvature known as the lichnerowicz theorem @xcite .    on the other hand",
    "such zero mode solutions arise directly from eqs.(38,39 ) for the first case of equilibrium when @xmath18 in the case of the disk stock market .",
    "for the special choice of boundary conditions which could represent some market behavior we can always found zero mode solutions on disk stock market .",
    "the result is that disk market is some idealization of the real nonlinear market behaviour on the spherical brane and converge to the black scholes solutions .",
    "figures 2,3 shows the behaviour of the stock market or some derivatives for a special choice of the model parameters to obtain a results of stock prices similar as from the black scholes and semi - classical equations .    finally to obtain real financial dynamics of stock market full mathematical equations eqs.(26,27 ) and eq.(36 ) obtained on the spherical brane with appropriate boundary conditions need to be exactly solved . to do all these analyses",
    "is the main qoal for the future work .",
    "george soros in his book @xcite underlined a fundamental difference between natural and social sciences .",
    "the events studied by social sciences have thinking participants and natural phenomena do not .",
    "the participants thinking creates problems that have no counterpart in natural science .",
    "there is a close analogy with quantum physics , where the effects of scientific observations give rise to heisenberg uncertainty relations and bohr s complementarity principle .",
    "moreover , the behaviour of the stock market described with the wave function or in our case with the spinor wave function of the stock market carries more real information of a market .    in the book",
    "george soros philosophically compare the predictable behaviour ( prediction of prices ) in our approach regular modes of the wave function with unpredictable behaviour ( psychological factors of people in the market ) as irregular modes of the wave function of the financial market .",
    "all clasical and semiclasical teories described only regular modes or predictable behaviour of the stock market .",
    "also soros statement about cognitive phenomena at the financial market included deeper knowledge of the financial dynamics .",
    "this paper is some attempt where a new approach was used to obtain descriptions of the dynamics of market panic on financial world .",
    "this is only first review of some new relativistic approach to stock market dynamics where for concrete realizations and applications on financial market a lot of analyses and computations on real financial data need to be done .",
    "it is also some challenge for the reader for those our approach is interesting to bring ideas from the theoretical field to the real market applications .",
    "these ideas can be extended to higher dimensional branes of financial market .",
