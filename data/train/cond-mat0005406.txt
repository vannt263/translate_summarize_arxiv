    "ternary compounds rm@xmath0x@xmath0 ( r= rare earth m= 3@xmath5 , 4@xmath5 or 5@xmath5 transition metal and x = si or ge ) exhibit large anisotropic magnetic properties .",
    "prru@xmath0si@xmath0 exhibits the largest measured magnetocrystalline anisotropy . the anisotropy field at 4.2 k is estimated to be so enormous as 400 t @xcite .",
    "prru@xmath0si@xmath0 crystallizes in the tetragonal structure thcr@xmath6si@xmath0-type and orders ferromagnetically below t@xmath7=14k @xcite .",
    "its magnetic susceptibility shows strongly anisotropic behavior in temperatures above t@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence of the specific heat of prru@xmath0si@xmath0 shows the well - defined anomaly at the ferromagnetic ordering temperature .",
    "the temperature dependence of the magnetic entropy computed from the magnetic contribution shows value rln2 at about 30k , indicating the existence of two closely - lying levels .",
    "inelastic - neutron - scattering experiments @xcite reveal local excitations with energies of 2.25 and 29 mev providing strong argument for the existence of the localized cef - like levels .",
    "the aim of this paper is the evaluation , on basis of all known experimental results , of the energy level scheme of the fine electronic structure of the pr@xmath8 ion in prru@xmath0si@xmath0 associated with the configuration 4@xmath9 .",
    "this structure provides consistent description of main magnetic and electronic properties of the compound under study , the direction and the ordered moment value as well as the sharp peak at t@xmath7 in the temperature dependence of the heat capacity , in particular .",
    "in the individualized - electron model @xmath10 electrons keep their individuality also being placed into intermetallic compounds . in the intermetallic compound there",
    "coexists a few ( here only 2 are specified ) physically important electronic subsystems : @xmath10 electronic subsystem(s ) and conduction - electron ( c - e ) subsystem .",
    "these two subsystems are described by completely different theoretical approaches : localized - electron and itinerant - electron models .",
    "the @xmath10 electron subsystem exhibits the discrete energy spectrum associated with bound states of the electronic system @xmath11 .",
    "itinerant electrons occupy the conduction band states .",
    "we have attributed the magnetic properties of prru@xmath0si@xmath0 to be predominantly due to the @xmath12 electronic system of the pr@xmath8 ions because the c - e susceptibility is small and largely temperature independent as we know from the studies of laru@xmath0si@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the hund s rules ground multiplet is @xmath3h@xmath4 with @xmath13 = 4 , @xmath14 = 1 , @xmath15 = 5 and the land factor @xmath16 = 4/5 .",
    "the general hamiltonian contains the single - ion - like and the intersite terms @xcite :    @xmath17    the first term is the cef hamiltonian written for the lowest multiplet given by hund s rules @xmath3h@xmath4 .",
    "the second term represents the exchange interactions between the pr ions written in the mean - field approximation with the molecular - field coefficient @xmath18 .",
    "the third one describes the zeeman effect .",
    "the energy level scheme of the pr ion in prru@xmath0si@xmath0 for the tetragonal symmetry cef hamiltonian contains 5 singlets and 2 doublets @xcite .",
    "a full set of cef parameters relevant to the tetragonal symmetry is given by : @xmath19 = -22 k , @xmath20 = + 0.22 k , @xmath21 = + 0.20 k , @xmath22 = -12 mk and @xmath23 = -45 mk .",
    "this set of parameters has been derived by our self - consistent analysis of experimental data .",
    "this set of cef  parameters describes well    \\i ) the energy separations revealed by the inelastic neutron scattering ,    \\ii ) anisotropic temperature dependence of the susceptibility in the paramagnetic region ,",
    "\\iii ) the direction of the magnetic moment ( along the tetragonal c axis ) in the ordered state ,    \\iv ) the spontaneous moment of the pr ion in 4.5 k of about 2.7 @xmath24 ,    \\v ) the giant magnetocrystalline anisotropy of the magnetization curves at 4.5 k ,    \\vi ) temperature dependence of the specific heat with the @xmath25type peak at t@xmath26    the consistent description of so many physical properties provides the strong argument for our theoretical approach .",
    "the ground state is a singlet in the form :    @xmath27    the resulting energy - level scheme is shown in fig.1 .",
    "it provides excitations observable in inelastic - neutron - scattering ( ins ) experiments at energies of 30 k ( @xmath28 ) and 330 k ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) .",
    "these excitations have been observed , indeed , in ins experiments by mulders et al .",
    "@xcite ( 2.25 and 29 mev ) . in this experiment the 330",
    "k excitation decreases with the increasing temperature .",
    "this fact we take as the further confirmation of our scheme . with the increasing temperature the contribution @xmath32 @xmath33 having the lower energy , increases together with the boltzmann population of the @xmath34 state .",
    "this observation provides indirect argument for the existence of the state @xmath35 at 58 k - the neutron excitations to it from the lower states are prohibited .",
    "as will be shown later the existence of a state at about 60 k is in very good agreement with the overall temperature dependence of the specific heat .",
    "the entropy analysis performed in ref .",
    "1 shows that there is a place for this extra state owing to the increasing difference between the experimental and calculated , for two states only , entropy as one can see in fig . 2 of ref.1",
    ".    closely lying first excited state together with the ground state creates the interesting system .",
    "their field - induced @xmath36 components have opposite signs what lead to their opposite interactions with the magnetic field . as a consequence",
    "this 2-levels system behaves as the quasi doublet .",
    "moreover , there is the large matrix element between these states .",
    "thanks it the magnetism of this system can be relatively easily induced by spin - dependent interactions despite of general non - magnetic character of singlets .",
    "such the charge - formed ground state allows the appearance of the large magnetic moment , of 2.7 @xmath37 in agreement with experimental observation .",
    "also the direction of the moment is related with the shape of the eigenfunctions of this 2-level system .      in the quantum paramagnetic theory",
    "the magnetic moment is a property of the electronic state of the paramagnetic ion .",
    "the value of the magnetic moment of the ion reflects dependence of the energy of the ion with respect to the magnetic field @xmath38 according to the definition @xcite : @xmath39 @xmath40 is the total energy of the system over available electronic states resulting from the hamiltonian 1 and shown in fig.1 . the population of states shown in fig .",
    "1 is given by the boltzmann statistics .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility in the paramagnetic region was calculated from the direct diagonalization of the hamiltonian , eq .",
    "1 , without the second term .",
    "the inverse of calculated temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility in the paramagnetic region is shown in fig.2 .",
    "it exhibits very anisotropic behavior with the easy c axis .",
    "the behavior @xmath41 in the magnetic field parallel to the c axis almost follow the curie - weiss law .",
    "the derived effective paramagnetic moment at room temperature amounts to 4.18 @xmath24 .",
    "it is larger than the free - ion value of 3.58 @xmath24 and this fact is caused by strong cef interactions .",
    "this paramagnetic moment decreases with the increase of temperature approaching the theoretical value at temperatures comparable with the overall size of the cef  interactions . in the perpendicular field",
    "the calculated susceptibility is very small .",
    "the visible discrepancy between calculated and experimental curves we attribute to its small value that becomes comparable to the conduction - electron contribution .      at t@xmath1 of 14 k magnetic order wins the temperature disordering .",
    "it is accounted for in our calculations with the effective exchange interaction parameter @xmath18 of 2.35 t/@xmath24 .",
    "the magnetic ordering produces the abrupt change in the energy level scheme that manifests in the @xmath42 peak at t@xmath43 .",
    "the calculated moment of the pr ion is parallel to the c axis in agreement with experiment .",
    "it amounts to 2.7 @xmath24 at 0 k fully reproducing the experimental datum @xcite . for completeness",
    "we add that it turns out from our calculations that at 0 k the pr@xmath8 ion in prru@xmath0si@xmath6 experiences the internal molecular field of 6.4 t that originates from the intersite rkky interactions .",
    "the magnetic moment of the pr@xmath8 ion is strongly tied to the tetragonal c axis as we see from the magnetization curves . in fig .",
    "3 the full magnetization curves , at 4.5 k , calculated within our cef approach are presented .",
    "they are highly anisotropic : the field of 5.5 t applied along the c - axis induces @xmath44 of 3.6 what is about 100 times more then the value for @xmath45 .",
    "this anisotropy preserves also in measurements up to 35 t , where magnetization along the c and a axes is 3.08 @xmath24 and 0.39 @xmath24 , respectively @xcite .",
    "this large anisotropy is in agreement with single - crystal magnetic measurements of shigeoka et al.@xcite .",
    "the anisotropy field derived from our calculated curves amounts to 400 t. this value corresponds to the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy of 59 j / cm@xmath3 , that is extremaly large .    for calculations of the magnetization curves in the ferromagnetic state along the c - direction , shown in fig .",
    "3 , the primary field - induced moment curve @xmath47(b@xmath48 ) , shown in the insert , has been used .",
    "the extraction of the influence of the external field @xmath49 , the internal field @xmath50 has to be subtracted what leads to the metastable region at zero field .",
    "such the metastable situation means the spontaneous formation of the ferromagnetic state .",
    "the derived cef parameters account also for the ferromagnetic ordering with its direction , the ordering temperature and the size of the pr - ion moment and the giant magnetic anisotropy .",
    "these calculations reveal that the giant anisotropy , even above 400 t , can be realized by the crystal - field interactions .",
    "the magnetic component of rare - earth specific heat is calculated by making use of the general formula @xcite :    @xmath51    @xmath52 is the free energy of the rare - earth subsystem over the available energy states resulting from the consideration of the hamiltonian ( eq .",
    "1 ) . the calculated contribution of the pr@xmath8 ions to the specific heat of prru@xmath0si@xmath0 is shown in fig.4 .",
    "the overall behavior @xmath53 is in very good agreement with experimentally derived magnetic contribution to the specific heat @xcite .",
    "our calculations reproduce well :    \\i ) a @xmath42-type peak at 14 k associated with the occurrence of the ferromagnetic order .",
    "there is slight discrepancy in description of the shape of the peak ; the calculated one is wider then the experimental one",
    ". it may indicate more dramatic character of the phase transition at t@xmath1 ,    \\ii ) a tail of the schottky - like peak above t@xmath1 .",
    "the reproduction of the @xmath42 peak is important outcome of the present paper .",
    "the previous calculations of ref .",
    "1 could not get the @xmath42 peak because they worked out with thermally independent electronic states .",
    "in fact , the model of ref.1 could not produce the ferromagnetic order .",
    "this good agreement indicates on the substantial confidence to the presently derived fine electronic structure .",
    "our scheme gives much better description of the overall @xmath53 dependence then previous calculations presented in ref .",
