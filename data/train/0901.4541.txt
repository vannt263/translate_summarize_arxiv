    "ultrafast light - induced magnetization dynamics in ferromagnetic films and in diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) is today a very active area of research . from the observation of the ultrafast dynamics of the spin magnetization in nickel films @xcite and the analogous processes in ferromagnetic semiconductors @xcite",
    ", special interest has been devoted to the development of dynamical models able to mimic the time evolution of the magnetization on both short and long time scales . in iii - v ferromagnetic semiconductors such as gamnas and",
    "inmnas a small concentration of mn ions is randomly substituted to cation sites so that the mn - mn spin coupling is mediated by the hole - ion @xmath0 exchange interaction , allowing the generation of a ferromagnetic state with a curie temperature of the order of 50 k @xcite .",
    "the magnetism can therefore be efficiently modified by controlling the hole density through doping or by excitation of electron - hole pairs with a laser pulse .",
    "in particular , unlike metals , in a regime of strong laser excitation total demagnetization can be achieved @xcite .    in the zener model @xcite , which was originally developed to describe the magnetism of transition metals ,",
    "the @xmath1 shells of the mn ions are treated as an ensemble of randomly distributed impurities with spin @xmath2 surrounded by a hole gas or an electron gas .",
    "unlike ferromagnetic metals , iii - mn - v ferromagnetic semiconductors offer the advantage of providing a clear distinction between localized mn impurities and itinerant valence - band hole spins , thus allowing the basic assumptions of the zener theory to be satisfied . based on this hypothesis ,",
    "a few mean - field models have been successfully applied for modelling the ground - state properties of dms nanostructures . in particular , within the framework of the spin - density - functional theory at finite temperature , relevant predictions of the curie temperature have been obtained @xcite .",
    "ultrafast demagnetization in dms is a phenomenon where the @xmath0 exchange interaction causes a flow of spin polarization and energy from the mn impurities to the holes , which is subsequently converted to orbital momentum and thermalized through spin - orbit and hole - hole interactions @xcite .",
    "since energy and spin polarization transfer is a many - particle effect , the mean - field zener approach can not provide a satisfying explanation of the ultrafast demagnetization regime that has been observed in dms @xcite .    a phenomenological approach able to take into account this energy flux",
    "was given in @xcite where a model based on three temperatures was derived .",
    "more recently , a study of the coupling of the electromagnetic laser field with the hole gas revealed the possibility of an ultrafast demagnetization during the femtosecond optical excitation , due to light - hole entanglement @xcite . a model capable of describing the dynamics of carrier - ion spin interactions is provided in @xcite .",
    "this model generalizes the stationary theory of @xcite and takes into account the picosecond demagnetization evolution which occurs in a strong excitation regime , but neglects the slow - in - time evolution of the spin dynamics .",
    "the mean @xmath0 interaction is averaged out over the randomly distributed positions of the mn ions .    in this work",
    "we derive a dynamical model based on a many - particle expansion of the @xmath0 exchange interaction based on the pseudo - fermion method .",
    "this formalism , originally developed by abrikosov to deal with the kondo problem @xcite , introduces unphysical states in the hilbert space for which impurity sites are allowed to be multiply occupied .",
    "following the work of coleman @xcite , a suitable limit procedure is applied to our dynamical model in order to recover the correct physical description of the magnetic impurities .",
    "our approach extends the zener model beyond the usual mean - field approximation .",
    "it includes both the subpicosecond demagnetization dynamics and the slower cooling processes that restore the initial ferromagnetic order ( which is achieved in a ns time scale ) .",
    "moreover , in agreement with recent experimental results @xcite our simulations show that , depending on the initial lattice temperature , a subsequent enhancement of the total magnetization is observed within a time scale of 100 ps .",
    "we consider a volume @xmath3 containing @xmath4 holes with spin @xmath5 strongly coupled by spin - spin interaction with @xmath6 randomly distributed mn impurities with spin @xmath7 .",
    "we assume that the exchange interaction between localized ions and heavy holes dominates over both the short - range antiferromagnetic @xmath8 exchange interaction between the ions and the @xmath9 exchange interaction between electrons in the conduction band and mn ions ( typical values for the @xmath9 and the @xmath0 interactions in a gaas are 0.1 ev and 1 ev respectively @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , electron - hole radiative recombination , carrier - phonon interactions , and interactions leading to the hole spin - relaxation in the hole gas are included phenomenologically .",
    "the time evolution of the system is governed by the hamiltonian @xmath10 where @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of a hole with spin projection @xmath13 and quasi - momentum @xmath14 . in the parabolic band approximation",
    "the kinetic energy of the holes reads @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the valence band edge .",
    "the kondo - like exchange interaction @xmath17 is given by @xmath18 where the sum is extended over all indices , @xmath19 is the @xmath0 coupling constant , and @xmath20 , @xmath21 are the spin matrices related to @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively .",
    "the ion spin operator is represented in the pseudo - fermion formalism @xcite in which @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) denotes the creation ( annihilation ) operator of a pseudo - fermion with spin projection @xmath26 and spatial position @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath17 hamiltonian reproduces the correct ion - hole exchange interaction provided that the ion sites are singly occupied , i.e. , @xmath28 @xmath29 .",
    "following @xcite this constraint may be taken into account by adding a `` fictitious '' ionic chemical potential @xmath30 to the original hamiltonian and letting @xmath31 go to infinity at the end of the calculation .",

    "indeed , since the photoexcited holes experience efficient spin - flip scattering with the localized mn magnetic moments , a net spin polarization is transferred from the ion impurities to the holes leading to a significant increase of the hole spin polarization .",

    "@xcite , which was derived following a different perspective .",
    "numerical simulations showed that our model is able to reproduce qualitatively  and to some extent quantitatively  the long - time evolution of the total magnetization after laser irradiation , as seen in recent experiments @xcite .",
    "the early demagnetization observed in the experiments is explained as the result of a net flow of polarization from the ions to the holes , which is subsequently dissipated via spin - orbit coupling .",
    "thus , the typical demagnetization time scale is mainly determined by the nonlinear coupling between the ions and holes spins , with a lower bound given by the spin - orbit time scale , @xmath163 .",
    "the demagnetization process can not be faster than @xmath164 , but can be significantly slower , depending on the lattice temperature .",
