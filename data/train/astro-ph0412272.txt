    "mcneil s nebula was first reported in late january 2004 as a new optically- revealed object in the vicinity of the ngc 2068 star forming region .",
    "subsequent studies showed it to be an outburst event that began in november / december 2003 , and rose in brightness by about 4 magnitudes at @xmath1 over the next few months ( briceo et al .",
    "the morphology of the nebula is consistent with a cavity in the envelope of a protostar scattering light from the highly reddened central source ( briceo et al .",
    "2004 ; reipurth & aspin 2004 ; kun et al .",
    "the presumed source of the outburst , v1647 ori , corresponds to the mid - infrared source iras 05436 - 0007 , whose pre - outburst spectral energy distribution ( sed ) is that of a flat - spectrum source ( abraham et al .",
    "such objects are usually considered to be in transition between the class i and ii pre - main sequence evolutionary phases , with accretion disks and dissipating infalling envelopes .",
    "near - infrared spectral characteristics showing both disk accretion signatures such as hydrogen and co emission ( reipurth & aspin 2004 ; vacca et al .",
    "2004 ) and envelope features such as water and co ice absorption ( vacca et al .",
    "2004 ) , as well as the apparent lack of a molecular outflow ( lis et al .",
    "1999 ) , all seem to confirm the transitionary nature of this object .",
    "the appearance of v1647 ori has provided a rare opportunity to study eruptive phenomena in young stellar objects ( ysos ) , events which are likely to have a significant effect on the evolution of young stars and their circumstellar material .",
    "the post - outburst data to date have suggested a significant increase in luminosity by factors of 10 - 25 in the optical and near - infrared ( briceo et al .",
    "2004 ; reipurth & aspin 2004 ) .",
    "andrews et al . ( 2004 ) , based on @xmath2-band photometry and spectroscopy and submillimeter observations , estimated a total bolometric luminosity in the range of @xmath3 .",
    "spectral features such as p cygni profiles at h@xmath4 , pa@xmath5 , and he i indicate a strong wind associated with the outburst , probably accretion - generated ( reipurth & aspin 2004 ; vacca et al . 2004 ; walter et al .",
    "jet - related features such as forbidden emission lines or shocked molecular hydrogen are not seen near the source , although a collimated outflow is suggested by the presence of hh 23 roughly an arcminute to the north .",
    "the nature of the outburst is not yet clear , as the observational characteristics are not completely consistent with either of the main classes of eruptive variables seen in ysos , the fuors and exors .",
    "fuors have outburst timescales of decades , with an initial brightening of typically 4 - 5 magnitudes in the optical , while exor events are generally much shorter ( of the order of weeks or months ) and exhibit smaller luminosity increases .",
    "we present serendipitous _ spitzer",
    "_ observations of v1647 ori and its immediate surroundings .",
    "our data span a wavelength range of 3.6 - 70 , obtained separately with the infrared array camera ( irac ) and multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips ) within the span of about a week near the peak of the outburst .",
    "these data provide a unique opportunity to study a rare outburst event over an unprecedented range of wavelength , probing physical effects over a large range of dust temperatures and hence distances from the central source .",
    "v1647 ori was observed by both irac and mips in the course of mapping the ngc 2068/2071 star formation region , as part of a gto science program .",
    "the irac observations were taken on march 7 , 2004 .",
    "two dithers were taken at each position , with a 0.4 and 10.4 second integration time per dither .",
    "the linearization , flat fielding and dark subtraction of the data were performed by using the irac pipeline at the spitzer science center , version s9.5 . since the source",
    "was saturated in the first two channels , we determined the fluxes in those bands by fitting a psf to the unsaturated part of the data , and then measuring the magnitude via aperture photometry of the fitted psf .",
    "fluxes for the other two channels were determined via aperture photometry of the individual 0.4 second frames , which were not saturated .",
    "the zero points for the absolute flux calibration are 19.660 , 18.944 , 16.880 , and 17.394 in channels 1 - 4 , respectively .",
    "we estimate total uncertainties of about 10% .",
    "the same region was mapped with mips using scan mode ( rieke et al . 2004 ) on march 15 , 2004 .",
    "medium scan rate with half - array offsets was employed , providing a total effective exposure time per pixel of 80 seconds at 24 and 40 seconds at 70 .",
    "the data were reduced and mosaicked using the instrument team in - house data analysis tool , which includes per - exposure calibration of all detector transient effects , dark current subtraction , and flat fielding / illumination correction ( gordon et al .",
    "v1647 ori is saturated in the psf core at 24 .",
    "we derived photometry by again fitting to the unsaturated part of the psf .",
    "we estimate an error of @xmath6 for this process , which is comparable to that of the systematic uncertainty in our overall photometric calibration .",
    "portions of the final irac channel 2 and mips 24 mosaics around v1647 ori are shown in figure  [ 24image ] .",
    "several other objects of interest are seen here .",
    "the bright source to the east of v1647 ori corresponds to the t tauri star lkh@xmath4 301 .",
    "we also discover two previously unknown sources roughly 30 \" to the sw and ne of v1647 ori , the latter of which corresponds to herbig - haro object hh 22a .",
    "most of these sources will be presented in a future paper on the entire ngc 2068 region ; however , we briefly discuss hh 22a in section 3 .",
    "the resulting post - outburst sed from our _ spitzer _ measurements is shown in figure  [ seds ] .",
    "also plotted are optical @xmath7 and near - infrared @xmath8 measurements from reipurth & aspin ( 2004 ) .",
    "these data are not simultaneous ; the near - infrared data in particular were taken over a month before the _ spitzer _ data .",
    "nevertheless , we believe all these measurements should be representative of the outburst near its maximum , as optical and near - infrared photometry spanning this range of dates shows little overall change in the source brightness ( e.g. , briceo et al . 2004 ; kun et al .",
    "2004 ; mcgehee et al .",
    "2004 ; walter et al .",
    "we do note that the scatter between different optical studies is quite large , which probably reflects significant contamination from scattered light , not surprising given the presence of an envelope around the source ( see below ) .",
    "the sed shape is qualitatively similar to the pre - outburst sed ( also shown in fig .",
    "[ seds ] ) , with the spectrum increasing sharply to @xmath9 m and then becoming flatter at longer wavelengths.the overall luminosity increase is impressive , with a factor of 15 - 20 increase in brightness across the spectrum from the optical to 70 @xmath10 m .",
    "we measure a total bolometric luminosity of @xmath11 , a factor of @xmath12 increase from the pre - outburst state .",
    "the most likely explanation for this event is an increase in the accretion luminosity of the central source driven by an instability in the accretion disk , which subsequently illuminated an envelope that surrounds the source . to explore this idea in more depth",
    ", we will test whether the protostellar characteristics of an accretion disk plus infalling envelope can explain the observed sed both before and during the outburst .",
    "we have constructed simple models of both a viscous accretion disk ( kenyon et al . 1988 ) and a remnant optically thin envelope ( adams et al .",
    "1987 ; kenyon & hartmann 1991 ) , changing the accretion luminosity produced by the disk by a factor of @xmath12 to simulate the outburst .",
    "we first employ a standard steady viscous accretion disk model , as first applied to fu orionis objects ( kenyon et al .",
    "1988 ) . in this formulation ,",
    "the disk temperature is specified by the mass and radius of the central star , the mass accretion rate @xmath13 in the disk , and a radial dependence of @xmath14 .",
    "the disk is assumed to be flat , with radiation at each radius given by a blackbody at the appropriate temperature .",
    "we adopted a typical t tauri stellar mass and radius of @xmath15 and @xmath16 , as suggested by the low pre - outburst bolometric luminosity .",
    "for the outburst spectrum , we derived a disk mass accretion rate of @xmath17 by assuming that @xmath18 is dominated by the accretion luminosity ( i.e. , @xmath19 ) .",
    "these parameters result in a maximum inner disk temperature of @xmath20 k , which should produce optical spectral features analogous to that of an early - f stellar photosphere .",
    "the reflected optical spectrum of v1647 ori taken by briceo et al .",
    "( 2004 ) shows balmer absorption consistent with either an early - f or early - b spectral type ; those authors favor the latter because of a lack of ca ii h & k absorption .",
    "however , the h & k lines may be filled in by emission from the wind or accretion flow , as has been seen in early spectra of the fuor v1057 cyg ( herbig 1977 ) and the prototype exor ex lupi ( herbig et al . 2001 ) .",
    "a high - resolution spectrum would be required to resolve this issue . after calculating the emergent flux from the disk , we applied extinction assuming an interstellar extinction law and @xmath21 , similar to previous estimates based on the optical spectrum of the source ( briceo et al .",
    "2004 ) and the depth of the 3@xmath10 m ice feature ( vacca et al .",
    "for the pre - outburst spectrum , we lowered the mass accretion rate by a factor of @xmath2215 , in accordance with the observed change in bolometric luminosity .",
    "this value is at the high end of the typical range of values for t tauri stars ( gullbring et al .",
    "1998 ) , and in particular is similar to that of the flat - spectrum ctts dg tau ( gullbring et al .",
    "2000 ) and many class i objects ( muzerolle et al . 1998 ; white & hillenbrand 2004 ) .",
    "we also increased the extinction to @xmath23 , consistent with the reddening change implied by the near - infrared photometry ( reipurth & aspin 2004 ) .",
    "it is not clear whether this apparent extinction change is the result of material near the central source suddenly moving away or sublimating during the outburst , or simply the result of a change in the scattered light component .",
    "since we do not include the effects of scattered light in our model , we essentially ignore this question by adopting an ad - hoc change in @xmath24 .",
    "the disk models provide excellent fits to the optical and near - infrared portion of the pre- and post - outburst seds ( fig .",
    "[ seds ] ) , especially given that the observations for each sed are not all simultaneous .",
    "however , the mid- and far - infrared fluxes are much larger than can be accounted for with the disk models alone .",
    "some of this discrepancy could be explained by adopting a flared disk geometry , which would increase the mid - infrared flux via increased reprocessing of light from the central source .",
    "given the optical morphology of the nebula and the large inferred extinctions , it is more likely that there is an infalling envelope , heated by the central star and accretion disk , that is producing most of the long - wavelength flux .    as a simple initial exploration ,",
    "we have adopted an optically thin remnant envelope model , similar to that calculated by adams et al .",
    "( 1987 ) and kenyon & hartmann ( 1991 ) to explain fuor mid - infrared excesses .",
    "there are several lines of evidence that suggest the envelope around v1647 ori may be tenuous .",
    "one , the pre - outburst sed shows a flat spectrum , which is typically thought to indicate a transitionary phase between class i sources with dense infalling envelopes and class ii sources with no envelope .",
    "two , millimeter and submillimeter observations put an upper limit on the size of the emitting region of only @xmath25 au ( lis et al .",
    "1999 ; mitchell et al . 2001 ; andrews et al . 2004 ) , and andrews et al .",
    "( 2004 ) further estimate a circumstellar mass of only @xmath26 , which indicates that there is little left of the original envelope . in any case , the model is not intended for deriving actual envelope parameters , but merely to illustrate that the mid - infrared flux increase can be due to the increased heating of envelope material by the larger @xmath27 .",
    "the model assumes a spherically symmetric envelope with finite inner and outer radii @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and a density distribution given by steady - state infall : @xmath30 $ ] , where @xmath31 is the envelope mass infall rate ( e.g. , adams et al .",
    "we adopted a temperature distribution with a radial dependence @xmath32 , appropriate for optically thin envelopes , as in adams et al .",
    "we used the proportionality @xmath33 given by adams et al .",
    "( 1987 ) to scale the temperature at the inner radius between the pre- and post - outburst models .",
    "finally , we assumed an envelope filling factor @xmath34 to approximate a bipolar cavity ( the near lobe of which is seen in the optical as mcneil s nebula ) .",
    "the effects of inclination and scattering are ignored .    in order to produce the best fit to the pre - outburst sed , we varied @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath31 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 . in general ,",
    "the resulting values of these parameters ( see caption to fig .  [ seds ] ) are physically plausible .",
    "the temperature at the inner radius is similar to that of the more detailed envelope models of kenyon et al .",
    "( 1993 ) at similar radii .",
    "the envelope outer radius is fairly typical for class i objects , and consistent with the observed upper limit mentioned above .",
    "the infall rate of @xmath37 is similar to the expected value given typical gas temperatures in molecular cloud cores such as in taurus . finally , the filling factor @xmath38 is consistent with a remnant envelope where most of the material has already fallen onto the disk , while the accretion - powered outflow has carved out a progressively larger cavity .",
    "the total mass of the model envelope is @xmath39 , much less than the observed value , as expected if the observed mass is dominated by the disk .",
    "the same envelope model was used for the outburst spectrum , except that the primary source of heating , the disk accretion luminosity , was increased by the observed factor of @xmath12 , and @xmath35 was correspondingly increased by the proportionality given above .",
    "adding the envelope emission to the disk emission , we can qualitatively explain both the pre- and post - outburst seds from the optical to 70 @xmath10 m .",
    "the outburst model slightly underpredicts the irac measurements , which may indicate a hotter inner envelope temperature , or possibly reprocessed light from a flared outer disk not taken into account here .",
    "both models show a 10 @xmath10 m emission feature , in contrast to most flat - spectrum sources which usually show absorption .",
    "an @xmath2-band spectrum of v1647 ori taken during the outburst by andrews et al .",
    "( 2004 ) is featureless .",
    "this may indicate that the actual envelope is not strictly optically thin near 10 @xmath10 m , or that the dust opacity is not typical of the ism , both likely possibilities .",
    "a more detailed model taking these effects into account is needed to understand the envelope properties in detail .      we have discovered a mid - infrared source coincident with hh 22a , just @xmath40 northeast of v1647 ori .",
    "this herbig - haro object is part of hh 22 , a series of knots seen in [ sii ] emission ( eisloffel & mundt 1997 ) , tracing an east - west jet perpendicular to the hh 23 outflow that is likely emanating from v1647 ori .",
    "the knot hh 22a shows faint extended emission at 1.3 mm , and considerably stronger hco@xmath41 emission than seen at the position of v1647 ori ( lis et al .",
    "the irac images show extended emission in a fan - shaped structure at the position of hh 22a , aligned with the rest of the [ sii ] jet , some other knots of which are seen in the irac 4.5 @xmath10 m image .",
    "we also see a possible  counter - knot \" to hh 22 g , on the opposite side and nearly equidistant from hh 22a , previously unseen .",
    "the 24 source is also coincident with hh 22a , and quite bright ( @xmath42 mjy ) .",
    "our detections confirm that the hh 22 outflow is produced by a separate protostellar object .",
    "the source is extremely red , with an [ 8]-[24 ] color of @xmath43 .",
    "hence , it is likely an extremely embedded class i source , probably at an earlier evolutionary state than v1647 ori itself .",
    "our observations have shown that the outburst illuminating the optical mcneil s nebula involved a brightness increase across the spectrum to wavelengths as long as 70 @xmath10 m .",
    "the measured bolometric luminosity increased by a factor of @xmath12 to 44 @xmath44 .",
    "simple models of a viscous accretion disk can explain the optical and near - infrared outburst emission , but an outer envelope component heated by the accretion luminosity of the central source must be included to explain the mid - infrared emission .",
    "assuming @xmath18 is dominated by the accretion luminosity of the central source , and assuming typical stellar parameters appropriate for the pre - outburst luminosity , we estimate an approximate disk mass accretion rate of @xmath17 . such a rate is smaller than typical of fuor variables by about a factor of 10 ( kenyon & hartmann 1996 ) .",
    "however , we can not reliably classify the outburst with the present data .",
    "other properties of v1647 ori , such as the optical and near - infrared spectral features ( briceo et al . 2004 ; vacca et al .",
    "2004 ) , are something of an amalgam of both fuor and exor characteristics",
    ". the true test will be in the ultimate timescale of the event .",
    "our results provide the first variability measurements at such long wavelengths in young stellar objects .",
    "they show that outburst events may have a significant effect not only on the evolution of the central star and disk , but also the envelope .",
    "the additional heating and increased outflow activity may contribute to the eventual clearing of envelope material , leading to the onset of the class ii stage .",
    "the timescale for the dust in the envelope to respond to the change in luminosity of the central source should be dominated by the light travel time , which for our model envelope size , 2000 au , is roughly 5 days .",
    "since the outburst reached its peak roughly a month before our observations , the outburst sed should represent equilibrium conditions in the envelope .",
    "repeat observations should be made as the outburst declines in order to follow the evolution of the mid - infrared flux , which will provide more detailed information on the envelope properties .",
    "we thank n. calvet , l. hartmann , and c. briceo for helpful discussions .",

    "spitzer space telescope _ , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology under nasa contract 1407 .",
