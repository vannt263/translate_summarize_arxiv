    "different environments necessarily lead to differing merger histories , resulting in differences in the observable properties of each galaxy .",
    "in particular , denser environments lead to more frequent mergers , which cause significant structural changes to galaxies .",
    "also , gravitational harassment among galaxies in dense regions can affect the morphological properties of galaxies . within the context of the current paradigm of galaxy formation , it is possible to create computer simulations that begin with some matter distribution and",

    "such observations reveal a correlation of surface brightness profile with hubble type . furthermore , elliptical galaxies are slowly rotating systems characterized by triaxial shapes ; in contrast , spiral galaxies are rapidly rotating flattened structures .",
    "it has also been found that the average color of galaxies differs for the different galaxy types ; ellipticals tend to be redder , while spirals are bluer .",

    "new , large galaxy surveys open up the possibility of exploring such trends in different magnitude bands .    images of galaxies are a projection of the true shape .",
    "most studies of the axis ratio of galaxies have concentrated on understanding what the distribution of apparent axis ratios tells us about the intrinsic axis ratios ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "such information is a necessary ingredient for , among other things , understanding the kinematic properties of galaxies .",
    "generally , the distribution of apparent axis ratios for thin , nearly circular disks is an approximately uniform function , giving an average axis ratio of @xmath14 . for elliptical galaxies , which tend to be triaxial @xcite ,",
    "the distribution of apparent axis ratios is a steeply peaked function with an average value of @xmath15 .",
    "it is also found that the average axis ratio for ellipticals depends on luminosity , with brighter ellipticals being rounder @xcite .",

    ", we use the @xmath49 band data , at an effective wavelength of 6165 ; this is the band in which the star / galaxy classification is made .",
    "a useful measure of the apparent shape in the outer regions of galaxies is the axis ratio of the 25 mag arcsec@xmath50 isophote .",

    "the morphology of each galaxy in the sample is quantified by the parameter fracdev , and by the two measures of the apparent axis ratio : @xmath79 , which gives the shape in the outer region , and @xmath56 , which is more strongly weighted toward the inner region of the galaxy .",
    "a galaxy with absolute magnitude @xmath73 will enter the sdss spectroscopic survey if its luminosity distance is less than @xmath80 mpc , where the limiting apparent magnitude of the survey is @xmath81 . in our study of the relationship between surface brightness profile type and environment ,",

    "table [ tab : profile ] also lists , under the heading ` cylinder width ' , the total number of cylinders ( see  [ sec - env ] ) that do not intersect the border of the sdss spectrographic survey , which is the same as the number of galaxies that we keep in our analysis ( see  [ sec - env ] ) .",
    "the galaxies in each sample are subject to the quality cuts described in  [ sec - data ] .",
    "the environment of each target galaxy is determined by a count of neighboring galaxies .",
    "we adhere to the following in determining this count .",

    "the radius of the cylinder is one of the following : 0.5 @xmath96 mpc , 2 @xmath96 mpc , 8 @xmath96 mpc . counting the number of galaxies with @xmath98 in this cylinder defines our density parameter .",
    "we note that in dense environments , this method undercounts the true number of galaxies in each cylinder .",
    "this is because the spectroscopic fibers on each sdss plate can not be placed more closely than @xmath99 .",
    "this causes @xmath100 of galaxies ( of the total ) to be lost @xcite , undercounting galaxies in high density regions .",
    "fibers are assigned to galaxies with no correlations to galaxy properties @xcite .",
    "hence , there should be no significant effect to our results .",
    "for example , if @xmath101 of each galaxy type in the highest density bin were moved to the second - highest density bin , the relative fraction would not change .",
    "in general , this is the largest source of galaxy loss , as the completeness of the spectroscopic survey is @xmath102 @xcite .",

    "the sdss dr4 spectroscopic survey does not completely match the area covered by the dr4 photometric survey .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] shows the boundary of the spectroscopic survey .",
    "if a target galaxy is within one cylinder width of the border , it is dismissed from our analysis .",
    "in addition , if a galaxy is within one - half cylinder length , @xmath104 , of the maximum luminosity distance , it is dismissed from our analysis .    in determining the environment for target galaxies in each magnitude bin we count _ all _ of the galaxies brighter than the magnitude cut - off @xmath82 . in plotting our results , we group together at least 100 galaxies in each bin .",
    "we take the weighted mean of the number of galaxies in each cylinder that falls into a particular bin .",
    "this defines the local density , or environment for all galaxies in each bin .",
    "the highest density bin may have as few as 50 galaxies ( the only excpetion to this rule is the case with @xmath105 and @xmath106 mpc cylinders where the number in each bin is half that just described ) .",
    "we use the same density bins for all profile types so that we may determine the relative fraction of each .",
    "the bins are determined by the binning of the _ ex _ galaxies subject to the previously given conditions .",
    "we changed the possible binning for this analysis , varying it by profile type , and found no substantial change in the results .",
    "many studies ( e.g. @xcite ) have shown that as the density of galaxies in a region increases , the relative fraction of elliptical galaxies to spiral galaxies increases .",
    "instead of using the hubble classification scheme , we classify galaxies based on their surface brightness profile type , using four classes ranging from the highly concentrated _ de _ galaxies to the least concentrated _ ex _ galaxies .",

    "have shown that in the redshift interval @xmath109 , there is little evolution in the fraction of galaxies with @xmath110 ( corresponding to our classes _ de _ and _ de / ex _ ) . since all our other magnitude",

    "finally , it lists the total number of galaxies that survive all of our quality cuts ( see  [ sec - data ] and  [ sec - env ] ) .    we summarize the results as follows :    \\1 .",
    "figure [ fig:2 ] displays the results for cylinders of width @xmath111 mpc .",
    "there are four primary results .",
    "first , galaxies with @xmath112 are found to have mostly exponential light profiles in all environments .",
    "second , galaxies with @xmath113 have mostly de vaucouleurs light profiles in all environments .",
    "third , for galaxies with @xmath3 , as local density increases , the fraction of de vaucouleurs galaxies increases monotonically with increasing local density , while the fraction of exponentials decreases .",
    "fourth , there is a crossover of predominant profile type between high and low density environments only for galaxies with @xmath114 .",
    "plotting results for so many magnitude bins clearly shows how the change in dominant profile type depends not only on environment , but also on absolute magnitude .",
    "@xcite examined the morphology  environment relation for galaxies with @xmath115 ( assuming @xmath97 ) ; for a typical color @xmath116 , this corresponds roughly to @xmath117 .",
    "figures [ fig:3 ] and [ fig:4 ] display the effect of increasing the cylinder size .",
    "the main result is that trends are washed out on scales larger than about 2 @xmath96 mpc .",
    "there is no plot for the magnitude cut - offs @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 for cylinders that are @xmath118 mpc wide ; the volume of space probed is small enough that once all of the cylinders that intersect with the border are thrown out , there are too few galaxies left over to make the plot statistically interesting .",
    "this section of the paper addresses how the average shape of galaxies , as quantified by their apparent axis ratio , depends on their environment , for a fixed luminosity and profile type .",
    "our analysis of this topic is described below .",
    "we first highlight any differences in the methodology from the preceding section . unless otherwise mentioned",
    ", our methods here remain the same as those described in  [ sec - prof ] .",
    "one idiosyncrasy discovered in @xcite is that for fixed luminosity the average axis ratio is not always a monotonic function of srsic index .",
    "subdividing all galaxies into only two groups , one with all galaxies with fracdev @xmath119 0.5 , or @xmath120 , and another with the remaining galaxies , would average over this interesting behavior .",
    "this provides us with further motivation for maintaining our galaxy classification scheme , where we place galaxies in one of the four groups : _ ex _ , _ ex / de _ , _ de / ex _ and _ de _ ( see  [ sec - data ] ) .",
    "the survey volume for this analysis is similar to that described in  [ sec - vol ] .",
    "an important difference is that we place a stricter cut on the point spread function ( see  [ sec - data ] ) and in the process lose many de vaucouleurs galaxies . in @xcite",
    "it was noted that there is a luminosity  axis ratio trend . in the range",
    "@xmath121 $ ] the trend is approximately flat . in the range",
    "@xmath122 $ ] the axis ratio increases with increasing luminosity . for galaxies brighter than @xmath88 , the axis ratio seems to level off . in principle",
    ", this correlation could affect our results .",
    "this motivates us to keep luminosity bins as narrow as possible , so as to minimize any effect of this trend within a single bin . on the other hand ,",
    "statistical claims are only useful for large sample sizes . to keep our subsamples of galaxies large enough , we are motivated to keep luminosity bins as wide as possible . as a compromise",
    ", we make luminosity bins two magnitudes wide .",
    "we start by creating three volume - limited surveys with absolute magnitude cut - offs @xmath123 and @xmath88 . for the volumes corresponding to the first two cut - offs , we determine the environment ( see  [ sec - env ] ) for target galaxies that have absolute magnitude @xmath124 $ ] , while for the brightest cut - off we find the environment for all galaxies with @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "there are only sixteen galaxies that are brighter than @xmath125 in absolute magnitude in our volume ; therefore , their inclusion does not significantly widen the effective magnitude range of the bin .",
    "for example , in the volume corresponding to the @xmath126 cut - off we find the environment for all galaxies with @xmath127 $ ] where the luminosity distance of a galaxy is no larger than @xmath128 143 mpc , corresponding to the maximum luminosity distance at which a galaxy of absolute magnitude @xmath126 could be observed .",
    "the total number of galaxies in each volume , and the percentage of each profile type is presented in table [ tab : shape ] .",
    "table [ tab : shape ] also lists , under the heading ` cylinder width ' , the total number of cylinders ( see  [ sec - env ] ) that do not intersect the border of the sdss spectrographic survey , which is the same as the number of target galaxies that we keep in our analysis .",
    "the galaxies in each sample are subject to quality cuts which are described in  [ sec - data ] .",
    "the binning procedure is described in  [ sec - env ] .",
    "figures [ fig:5 ] through [ fig:7 ] show the correlations of apparent axis ratio with environment , labeled by profile type .",
    "tables [ tab : shape18 ] through [ tab : shape22 ] contain all related statistical information .",
    "we plot a best fit straight line through the binned data that minimizes the chi - square .",
    "the value of the reduced chi - square for each fit is printed in the tables .",
    "the error bars show the error in the mean assuming poisson statistics .",
    "the choice of colors , line type and point type are the same as previously described in  [ sec - profresults ] .",
    "since the average axis ratio depends on the average luminosity , the normalization of each best fit line , for the axis ratio  environment trend , is set by the average luminosity for that profile type . also , since the luminosity functions for each profile type are different in the different volume - limited samples , the average luminosity of each profile type is slightly different .",
    "for example , in the @xmath129 $ ] range , the _ ex _ galaxies have an average magnitude of @xmath130 , while the _ de _ galaxies have @xmath131 . from the luminosity  axis ratio trend , it is expected that the _ de _ galaxies would be rounder .",
    "this is reflected in figure [ fig:6 ] , say , where the trend for the _ de _ galaxies lies above the trend for the _ ex _ galaxies .",
    "therefore , while it is useful to compare the difference in the axis ratio as determined by the 25 mag arcsec@xmath50 isophote versus the axis ratio as determined by the adaptive moments technique , comparisons of axis ratios between galaxy profile types need to be made with the caveat that they contain different luminosity information .    in the absolute",
    "r _ band magnitude range @xmath122 $ ] , it has been shown @xcite that , for all profile types , there is a trend toward roundness as galaxies become brighter . in particular , the average axis ratio may increase by as much as approximately 0.05 when the magnitude decreases by unity @xcite .",
    "however , we find that the luminosity in each local density bin is equal to within one tenth of a magnitude confirming that any trend we see are not due to luminosity .",
    "specifically , for @xmath5 $ ] , the average magnitude for the _ ex _ galaxies is @xmath132 , for the _ ex / de _ galaxies it is @xmath133 , for the _ de / ex _ galaxies it is @xmath134 and for the _ de _ galaxies it is @xmath135 . in other magnitude ranges trends of mean axis ratio with luminosity are weaker and we also find that magnitude does not vary significantly from bin to bin .",
    "table [ tab : shape ] lists the number of galaxies in each of our volume - limited samples .",
    "also , it lists the fraction of galaxies of each profile type .",
    "tables [ tab : shape18 ] through [ tab : shape22 ] list all statistical information related to each profile type and cylinder size : the chi - square of the best fit line ; whether the axis ratio is increasing ( ` + ' ) or decreasing ( ` - ' ) with increasing local density ; our statistic labeled ` significance ' is the ratio of the slope to its standard deviation , characterizing if the slope is significantly different than zero .",
    "we summarize the results .",
    "\\1 . in the magnitude range",
    "@xmath121 $ ] the data show one statistically important trend at the @xmath136 level .",
    "the _ ex / de _ galaxies get rounder as the local density of galaxies increases , and the axis ratio , as measured by the axis ratio determined by the moments , for the _ de / ex _ galaxies increases with density .",

    "@xmath137 $ ] , we find that trends are more pronounced in the inner regions than the outer regions ; trends in the shape , determined by the moments of the light distribution , are no longer present when we use the axis ratio determined by the 25 mag arcsec@xmath50 isophote .",
    "this is especially true of the _ de _ galaxies .",
    "statistically , they show a strong positive trend in their axis ratio as determined by the moments of their light distribution",

    "there is a crossover from low densities to high densities ; galaxies with exponential profiles are more common at low densities , while at high local densities galaxies are most likely to be well described by a de vaucouleurs profile .",

    "these results fit well into the hierarchical structure formation picture . generally , the result of mergers is to increase entropy . in spiral galaxies , stellar orbits in the disk",
    "are nearly circular and all of the disk stars travel in the same direction , corresponding to a low overall entropy . on the other hand , orbits of stars in elliptical galaxies",
    "are unsystematic , giving rise to a high entropy system .",
    "moreover , each of these two systems have different light profiles .",
    "spiral galaxies tend to be less concentrated and have exponential profiles ; ellipticals have more of their light concentrated near their center and most bright ellipticals have de vaucouleurs profiles .",

    "they arrive at the conclusion that `` local density is not an important factor in determining the flattening of ellipticals '' .",
    "the lack of redshift information constrains @xcite to estimate the local density in projection .",
    "this dilutes the signal by inevitably counting galaxies that have similar celestial coordinates as neighbors , while in reality they are separated by a large distance in space .",
    "furthermore , they use a fixed angular scale on the sky within which they count the number of neighbors . for nearby galaxies , this scale corresponds to a larger physical distance than for distant galaxies .",
    "our plots ( figures [ fig:5 ] through [ fig:7 ] ) show that trends tend to get washed out as cylinder size increases .",
    "they are effectively mixing different cylinder sizes and in the process washing out any trend . within this angular area , @xcite",
    "label their galaxies as ` high - density ' if there are more than two neighboring galaxies , and ` low - density ' if there are two or less .",
    "this cut divides their sample into an approximately equal number of high and low density galaxies .",
    "they claim that there is no statistical difference in the observed distribution of their high and low density ellipticals .",
    "we performed a komolgorov - smirnov test on the distribution of axis ratios derived from the moments , for the _ de _ galaxies with @xmath139 $ ] in @xmath111 mpc cylinders .",
    "the ks probability is minimized when we place the cut between low and high densities at eight nearest neighbors ; this results in a probability of @xmath140 . instead of dividing our sample into two equal parts",
    ", this cut corresponds to a low / high density split of @xmath141 .",
    "thus @xcite did not see the trend for two reasons : density in projection is a poor measure , and the difference in shape is most significant in very high density environments .",
    "one open problem is whether or not field ellipticals are created and evolve in a fundamentally different way from those found in high density environments .",
    "@xcite have shown that the massive early type galaxies in low density environments appear to have younger stellar populations and be slightly more metal rich than the ones in high density environments . @xcite",
    "have shown that elliptical galaxies with younger stellar populations tend to be flatter in their inner regions than ones with older stellar populations .",
    "one possible explanation for such behavior is that the central black hole in older ellipticals has had a longer time to randomize the orbits of stars near the center . in light of our result that the inner regions of _ de _ galaxies tend to be more flattened in low density versus high density regions , these two previous studies may point to a more fundamental cause for our observed trends .",
    "however , using an age  environment correlation to explain our results is no more fundamental than simply saying that axis ratio and environment are correlated . instead , the missing link is in understanding what processes form centrally concentrated galaxies such as massive ellipticals .",
    "@xcite have used numerical simulations to show that it is possible to form elliptical systems from the merger of a large disk with multiple smaller disks . when a large disk galaxy is merged with one or two small disks ( with the mass ratio of the large disk to the small disk being 1:7 ) it is found that a galaxy of an intermediate type is created .",
    "such a galaxy may correspond to the _ ex / de _ and _ de / ex _ galaxies observed in the sdss .",
    "a well known fact is that the merger of two spirals of roughly equal mass leads to the creation of an elliptical ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , it has not been shown that the most common way of creating an elliptical is through the merger of two spirals .",
    "other numerical studies @xcite claim to find evidence that there exist elliptical galaxies that appear not to have been formed by a major merger of spirals .",
    "such studies show that different merger histories can lead to the creation of a galaxy with a de vaucouleurs profile .",
    "moreover , different merger histories lead to galaxies with different intrinsic axis ratios @xcite . if it was determined conclusively that certain types of mergers are favored in high versus low density regions",
    ", it would be possible to deduce the average axis ratio of galaxies in each environment .",
    "conversely , if different merger histories produce characteristically different axis ratios , it may be possible to work backwards and deduce which merger histories are more common in a given environment . in any case , the axis ratio of a galaxy , in its outer regions , could also depend on harassment from neighboring galaxies .",
    "however , without knowing which merger histories are favored in different environments , and assuming that the observed environment is similar to the pre - merger environment , it is not possible to determine the ` initial ' axis ratio of a galaxy and thus separate the the effect of harassment from that of the merger history .    one intriguing fact uncovered is that the _ ex _ and _ ex / de _ galaxies with @xmath142 are flatter , on average , in denser environments .",
    "these galaxies are primarily flattened disk galaxies , with a past free from major mergers . in a high density environment ,",
    "a galaxy may be harassed by numerous encounters in the past , or may have a tidal tail from a recent close encounter .",
    "these processes may distort the apparent shape of galaxies in dense regions .",
    "however , we visually inspected all the _ ex _ and _ ex / de _ galaxies that have 25 or more neighboring galaxies in a cylinder of radius @xmath143 mpc .",
    "there were 35 such galaxies , of which only one appeared to have a tidal tail and only one was a possible recent merger remnant .",
    "we also inspected 35 _ ex _ and _ ex / de _ galaxies with at most one neighbor ; none of them had obvious tidal tails or asymmetric distortions .",
    "almost all galaxies in our visual samples were separated from their neighbors by a distance significantly larger than the galaxy s visual radius .",
    "if the greater average flattening at higher density is due to tidal effects , then the tidal distortions must be subtle , rather than taking the form of strong tidal tails .",
    "the sdss has recently been used to study the correlation of many galactic properties with each other .",
    "exhaustive studies , such as those produced by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , arrive at the conclusion that luminosity and color are the fundamental galactic properties from which all correlations of other properties with environment are derived .",
    "such claims are tested in and are in reasonable agreement with numerical simulations as described , for example , in @xcite .",
    "however , we find a trend , namely the apparent axis ratio  local galaxy density correlation , for galaxies of the same _ r _ band luminosity and surface brightness profile type , that is not due to a correlation of luminosity or color with environment .",
