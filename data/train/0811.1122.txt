    "the stewart platform is a parallel manipulator with six degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "we will use the ( standard ) variables @xmath0 and @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the coordinates of the centre of the top platform , and @xmath4 and @xmath1 denote the euler angles defining the inclination of this platform with respect to the bottom platform , see figure [ fig1 ] .    the aim of this paper is to study the singular manifold which is defined by the physical configurations for which it will not be possible to determine the position of the platform uniquely by fixing the lengths of the legs .",
    "this is a well - known problem in parallel manipulators@xcite .",
    "the solution to the forward kinematics problem naturally divides into two cases , namely , a singular and a non - singular . in the non - singular case we recall the work@xcite of ji and wu and",
    "show that there are @xmath5 possible isolated singular solutions that correspond to the same legs lengths . in the singular case",
    "we extend the previous analysis and show how to obtain , for a given set of length legs , a set of singular solutions all of them parameterized by a scalar parameter .",
    "these solutions are a continuous curves in position space and in rotation space in which the platform moves without changing the values of the leg lengths .",
    "this fully characterize the singular manifold and shows that the platform is , in this case , completely singular .",
    "spatial rotations in three dimensions can be parameterized@xcite using both euler angles @xmath6 and unit quaternions @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "a unit quaternion may be described as a vector in @xmath9 @xmath10 the rotation matrix is given by @xmath11    consider the stewart platform shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "as shown there , the two coordinate systems @xmath12 and @xmath13 are fixed to the base and the mobile platforms .",
    "the platform geometry can be described by vectors @xmath14 , @xmath15 , defined by @xmath16 , @xmath15 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the base and top vertices coordinates , respectively , and @xmath19 is the center point of the top plate .",
    "we assume that these points are related by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a @xmath22 orthogonal matrix ( @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the @xmath22 identity matrix ) and @xmath250,1[$ ] is called the rescaling factor .",
    "the coordinates of the base vertices are given by @xmath26 given the position @xmath27 and the transformation matrix @xmath28 between the two coordinate systems , the leg vectors may be written as @xmath29 so the length for each @xmath30-leg is given by @xmath31    given @xmath32 , @xmath21 and @xmath19 the leg lengths are given by @xmath33",
    "in the forward kinematics the six leg lengths @xmath34 , @xmath15 , are given , while @xmath28 and @xmath19 are unknown .",
    "let @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and expand ( [ eq : l ] ) , then one gets , @xmath38 or @xmath39+(1+\\mu^2)(x_i^2+y_i^2 ) .",

    "the matrix given by ( [ eq : maux ] ) corresponds to the well known braikenridge - maclaurin construction .    in the next sections we will show that one can obtain the rotation matrix @xmath28 and the position @xmath19 in terms of the solution @xmath48 of the linear system given by ( [ eq : ls ] ) .",
    "the solution to the forward kinematics problem naturally divides into two cases , namely , a non - singular case where @xmath49 and a singular case where @xmath50 .    in the singular case ,",
    "we obtain for a given set of length legs , @xmath51 , a singular solution parameterized by a scalar parameter .",
    "these solutions are curves in position space and in rotation space in which the platform moves without changing the values of the leg lengths .      in the case where the six base vertices are not on a conic section",
    ", one gets @xmath49 , and so the solution of ( [ eq : ls ] ) , @xmath52 , can be obtained from @xmath53 the first three equations ( [ eq : w1 ] ) , ( [ eq : w2 ] ) and ( [ eq : w3 ] ) determines the rotation parameters , namely , @xmath32 , and the last three ( [ eq : w4 ] ) , ( [ eq : w5 ] ) and ( [ eq : w6 ] ) the position @xmath27 .    to determine the rotation parameters consider the equations @xmath54 which are obtained from ( [ eq : w4 ] ) , ( [ eq : w5 ] ) and ( [ eq : w6 ] ) , respectively . eliminating @xmath55 ,",
    "one gets , @xmath56 let @xmath57 then the above equations can be written as @xmath58 so , @xmath59 where @xmath60 substituting yields @xmath61 assuming @xmath62 and that ( [ eq : q3sol ] ) and ( [ eq : q2sol ] ) have two roots each , then , @xmath63 is determined by ( [ eq : q1q2 ] ) .",
    "consequently , we have a total of four different quaternions . these are @xmath64 where @xmath65 are the roots .    to determine the position , consider the equations @xmath66 thus @xmath67 obviously ( [ eq : plane1 ] ) and ( [ eq : plane2 ] ) represent two planes and their intersection is a line with equation given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the parameter of the line . the vectors @xmath70 and @xmath71 are given by @xmath72 the line ( [ eq : line ] ) intersects the sphere ( [ eq : sphere ] ) at two points @xmath73 given by @xmath74 where @xmath75 note that in order to @xmath73 exist one should have @xmath76 so , both @xmath28 and @xmath19 are found , and totally they have eight possible different solutions for a given set of leg lengths .",
    "in this case , we assume that all points belong to a circle @xmath77 ( we can assume @xmath78 without loss of generality ) , @xmath79 . in this case",
    "the matrix @xmath80 is singular , that is , @xmath50 and in fact , if all points are different and belong to a conic section the rank of @xmath45 is five ( corresponding to the braikenridge - maclaurin construction )",
    ". this will be the case if @xmath77 , @xmath79 , and @xmath81 for @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",
    "this fact enables us to explicitly compute the @xmath84 factorization of the matrix @xmath45 in terms of the coordinate of the vertices of the base @xmath85 , @xmath79 .",
    "these expressions are to big to be shown here but a script for the maxima computer algebra system@xcite is available upon request to the author .",
    "so the linear system @xmath86 can be put into the for @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 is a matrix with rank @xmath90 .",
    "the solution of ( [ eq : lnlu ] ) is given in terms of a solution @xmath91 which depends on the value of @xmath92 , which we take to be a free parameter .",
    "notice that any other quantity could be used for this purpose , although expression ( [ eq : sphere ] ) suggests that @xmath92 is the good choice .",
    "so the expressions given by ( [ eq : q1sol ] ) , ( [ eq : q2sol ] ) , ( [ eq : q3sol ] ) and ( [ eq : q0sol ] ) can be used to determine the the values of the quaternion @xmath32 , the rotation matrix , and the point @xmath19 as a function of the free parameter @xmath92 .",
    "the singular manifold of a stewart platform is define by the physical configurations for which it will not be possible to determine the position of the platform uniquely by fixing the lengths of the legs . by considering a simple stewart platform , for which the base vertices are in a circle ( although the result naturally holds for any conic section ) and",
    "the bottom and top plates are related by a rotation and a contraction , it was shown that the platform is always in a singular configuration .",
