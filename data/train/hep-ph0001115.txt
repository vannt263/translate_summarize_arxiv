    "string theory , the only known candidate for a fundamental theory including gravity , is formulated in more than three spatial dimensions .",
    "although the extrapolation of the observed physics to higher energies suggests a very small size of the extra dimensions , of @xmath9 , it has been recently proposed an alternative framework where some of these dimensions could have a large size @xcite . in particular , a compact dimension of inverse radius @xmath10 where only the gauge bosons and the higgs fields ( but not quarks and leptons ) propagate could define a viable scenario within the context of superstring theory @xcite .",
    "the presence of such a compact dimension at low scales has consequences on the unification of the gauge couplings of the standard model @xcite . in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm )",
    "the observed values are a consequence of the different running from the grand unification scale .",
    "obviously , this picture would be modified by a fifth dimension in the tev region .",
    "first , we note that 5-dimensional ( 5d ) field theories are not renormalizable and must be taken as effective theories valid only below a more fundamental mass scale , the string ( unification ) scale @xmath7 .",
    "second , in order to describe the effective theory we observe that the momentum along a compact dimension is quantized in units of @xmath3 .",
    "this will translate into an infinite tower of kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes associated to any field that penetrates the extra dimension .",
    "below @xmath7 it is possible to approximate the theory by a 4d truncated theory where the high energy modes have been cutoff . in particular , the authors in @xcite show that the one - loop corrections to the gauge couplings in the 5d theory almost coincide with the running in the truncated theory .",
    "the regularization dependence , which would describe the kk threshold effects , has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the kk approach provides a simple framework to understand the running of the couplings .",
    "a degree of freedom will be included in the loop only at scales larger than its mass . since at a given scale @xmath11",
    "the number of kk modes with masses lighter than @xmath2 is @xmath12 , the one - loop renormalization group equations ( rges ) become @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "the first equation gives a linear dependence of @xmath15 with @xmath16 , whereas the second one predicts a much faster exponential ( or linear versus @xmath2 ) behaviour .",
    "in addition , the @xmath17 coefficients will change as well due to the different field content of a superfield in five dimensions .",
    "actually , the 5d content can be accommodated in complete 4d hypermultiplets of @xmath18 supersymmetry ( susy ) @xcite .",
    "each gauge boson will come with its gaugino plus a fermion and a scalar in the adjoint representation of the gauge group , defining a complete vector hypermultiplet ( equivalent to a vector plus a chiral supermultiplets ) .",
    "for the matter fields , a chiral hypermultiplet will include a vectorlike pair of chiral superfields . in this way",
    ", the two higgs doublets of the mssm could in principle be different components of the same 5d field .",
    "since an extra dimension at a low scale @xmath3 would increase exponentially the evolution rate of the couplings , gauge unification could occur at much lower energies than in standard scenarios .",
    "unification would not necessarily introduce a hierarchy @xmath19 : if @xmath20 , then @xmath21 .",
    "the possibility of unification at a scale @xmath7 very close to @xmath3 has been explored recently by different authors @xcite .",
    "their one - loop analysis suggests gauge and also yukawa coupling unification in several definite models .",
    "the behaviour that they obtain above @xmath3 is similar to the standard one with the changes @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "however , there are important differences in the running when one goes beyond the one - loop level which can not be accounted with just these substitutions . in particular , whereas the 4d rges include at one loop the corrections of type @xmath24 , here the calculation will not include the corrections @xmath25 . here",
    "the parameter in the loop expansion is @xmath26 , not just @xmath27 .",
    "although the fields couple with strength @xmath27 , their number increases linearly with the energy and the analysis remains perturbative only if the product @xmath28 is small .",
    "then , even if @xmath4 higher order corrections may be already of order one .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the corrections to the one - loop @xmath29-functions of the gauge and the yukawa couplings in models with an extra dimension .",
    "we show that whereas the gauge sector is protected by the symmetries , in the yukawa sector the one - loop result is insufficient , since it is modified by higher order corrections proportional to @xmath30 and @xmath31 . due to these corrections",
    "@xmath32 could evolve fast towards large values , which would affect the ( two - loop ) evolution rate and the perturbative unification of the gauge couplings . in the models analyzed here",
    ", however , we observe the opposite behaviour due to the negative sign of the two - loop @xmath29-function , and @xmath32 introduces little change in the pattern of gauge unification obtained at one loop .",
    "let us start defining the 5-dim extension of the mssm .",
    "the gauge and higgs fields will live in the 5d bulk , whereas the fermions are localized on 4d boundaries and do not have kk excitations . at @xmath3",
    "we find a chiral superfield @xmath33 for each gauge superfield @xmath34 , whereas in the chiral sector there are pairs ( @xmath35 ) of higgs superfields .",
    "each of these fields has an infinite tower of kk modes of mass @xmath36 .",
    "the compactification of the fifth dimension must be such that the zero modes define the mssm , with no massless @xmath33 fields .",
    "this usually forces the presence of more than one pair of 5d higgs fields . to simplify we will consider only one pair of higgs doublets @xcite and comment later on a case with two pairs @xcite .",
    "we will also assume that _",
    "( i ) _ the couplings of the 4d chiral fields to the kk excitations coincide with their couplings to the zero modes and _ ( ii ) _ the number of excitations is the usual in a circle .",
    "this is not the case for the compactification on the segment @xmath37 @xcite , with half the resonances in the circle and with the couplings to the heavy modes increased by a factor of @xmath38 .",
    "our conclusions , however , will be the same in this scenario .    the tower of chiral superfields @xmath33 couples to the chiral higgses with an effective superpotential of type @xmath39 .",
    "all the interactions of the quark and lepton fields break the underlying @xmath18 susy ( their couplings with the heavy higgs and vector modes do not conserve the momentum along the fifth dimension ) .    in a general @xmath40 susy model with superpotential @xmath41 and gauge symmetry",
    "@xmath42 the @xmath29-functions ( @xmath43 , with @xmath44 a generic gauge or yukawa coupling ) can be deduced from the vector and chiral selfenergies . at one loop they read @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 the group constants are @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 . in the model under study",
    "we have ( see fig .",
    "1 ) @xmath52 , @xmath53 ( due to the cancellation of @xmath54 and @xmath55 contributions ) , and the mssm value for the third fermion generation @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) . including the sum over all kk modes of mass below @xmath2 we obtain @xmath58 and @xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the generic two - loop @xmath29-functions can be written @xcite @xmath63 p^n_{\\ ; p } + 2g^4c(\\phi)\\delta^i_{\\ ; j}q\\ , , \\label{beta20}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the dimension of the group .    in our framework",
    "the dominant two - loop correction to the gauge couplings would be proportional to @xmath65 , coming from two - point diagrams with exchange of heavy kk modes only .",
    "however , we have @xmath53 and @xmath66 \\delta_{ab } = g^2 q \\delta_{ab}$ ] , and the leading contribution to @xmath67 vanishes @xcite .",
    "this cancellation reflects the fact that a model with @xmath18 susy has to be renormalized only at the one - loop level , _",
    "i.e. _ , the one - loop counterterms render the theory finite at any order of perturbation @xcite .",
    "the subleading two - loop correction , proportional to @xmath68 , comes from diagrams with intermediate chiral fermions or zero modes of gauge or higgs fields .",
    "this correction does not vanish because the underlying @xmath18 susy is broken by the interactions of the fields in the loops .",
    "it can be written @xmath69   \\nonumber\\\\ & & -2g^3r^{-1 } c(h ) \\big [ ( 4 - 6 ) g^2 c(h ) d(h ) + { 1\\over 2 } y^{hff ' } y_{hff ' } + ( h\\leftrightarrow h ' ) \\big ] \\nonumber\\\\ & & -2g^3 c(\\sigma ) 2 g^2 \\big [ 2t(h ) - c(\\sigma ) \\big ]   \\nonumber\\\\ & & -2g^3r^{-1 } c(f ) \\big [ { 1\\over 2 } y^{fkl } y_{fkl } - 2 g^2 c(f ) d(f ) \\big ] \\ , , \\label{beta21}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is the dimension of the @xmath71 representation and @xmath72 stands for the chiral fermions .",
    "the terms in the first line in eq .",
    "( [ beta21 ] ) come from the diagrams in fig .",
    "2a @xcite .",
    "the diagrams with exchange of @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath54 fields have a factor of three , since there are three different ways to distribute the momentum along the fifth dimension ( _ i.e. _ , the kk modes ) among the fields in the internal loops . for the diagrams with @xmath75 and @xmath76 in the loops there is only one possible configuration , corresponding to the exchange of a tower of @xmath54 and @xmath55 fields , respectively .",
    "the contributions in the second , third and fourth line in eq .",
    "( [ beta21 ] ) are due to the diagrams in figs .  2b,2c,2d , respectively .",
    "the diagrams involving @xmath77 have a factor of two and the ones with intermediate @xmath78 fields have a factor of 3 .",
    "the remaining diagrams have only one possible configuration of kk modes .",
    "we obtain @xmath79    in the yukawa sector the situation is completely different .",
    "all the yukawa interactions break the @xmath18 susy structure present in the bulk and allow power - law corrections proportional to @xmath65",
    ". these can be especially important if they involve top quark interactions , since @xmath80 may be of @xmath81 below the unification scale @xmath7 .",
    "we obtain that the leading corrections cancel in the higgs selfenergies : @xmath82 . for a chiral fermion @xmath72",
    "the generic expression in ( [ beta20 ] ) becomes @xmath83 \\ , , \\label{cse2}\\ ] ] where the three contributions have their origin in the diagrams in figs .",
    "3a,3b,3c , respectively @xcite .",
    "in particular , for the top quark we find @xmath84 analogous expressions can be found for the bottom quark and the tau lepton .",
    "the dominant terms in the two - loop yukawa @xmath29-functions are then @xmath85",
    "for the gauge couplings , the two loops introduce corrections @xmath86 to the one - loop result ( the tilde stands for the coupling over @xmath87 ) . for example , keeping only the top and the color couplings we have @xmath88 . in the yukawa sector",
    "the two - loop corrections are @xmath89 $ ] .",
    "in particular , for @xmath32 we have @xmath90 . for an initial value @xmath91 , @xmath92 for @xmath93 .",
    "this estimate shows that the unification of the gauge and yukawa couplings at @xmath94 can not be stablished from just a one - loop calculation , it requires the analysis of higher order corrections .",
    "it could happen , for example , that the two - loop corrections increase the value of @xmath32 with the scale and make it very large at energies just above @xmath95 .",
    "this would also affect the evolution rate of the gauge couplings and could spoil de gauge unification obtained at one loop .",
    "in the particular scenario under study , however , we obtain the opposite effect . at @xmath3",
    "the one - loop @xmath29-functions for @xmath96 and @xmath97 are both negative , which retards the scale where the one and two - loop @xmath29-functions become of the same order .",
    "in addition , the two - loop contribution to @xmath98 is also negative , further decreasing @xmath97 and pushing up the range of energies where @xmath99 is small .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "4 the numerical running ( including all the couplings ) for @xmath100 and @xmath101 tev . dashes correspond to the one - loop running , so one can see graphically the effect of second order corrections . at @xmath102 tev",
    "two - loop effects account for a @xmath103 of the @xmath29-functions ( see fig .  5 ) .",
    "this relative value of @xmath104 , however , does not increase since the linear behaviour of @xmath104 with @xmath2 is dumped by the running of @xmath97 to smaller values dictated by the sign of its @xmath29-function .",
    "we have also deduced the rge in the model compactified in the orbifold @xmath37 .",
    "this model includes just one mode at each kk level , two pairs of higgs @xmath105 kk towers , and a factor of @xmath106 in the couplings of the chiral fermions to the massive kk modes .",
    "gauge unification is lost but the behaviour of two - loop corrections is completely analogous .",
    "we obtain ( see fig .",
    "6 ) also negative values for @xmath107 and @xmath108 , which again avoids _ large _ couplings at scales just above @xmath109 .",
    "we have studied whether in models with a compact dimension the low - energy value of the gauge and yukawa couplings can be related perturbatively with the value at a scale @xmath11 . in particular , we have calculated the two - loop corrections in a model with gauge unification at @xmath4 and also in the model compatified on @xmath37 .    for the gauge couplings we obtain that the underlying @xmath18 susy in the kk sector cancels the leading contributions in the two - loop @xmath29-functions . in consequence , @xmath110 , where @xmath27 refers to a generic @xmath111 or @xmath112 .    in the yukawa sector",
    "there is no symmetry reason for cancellations and @xmath113 @xmath114 $ ] .",
    "an estimate suggests that the one and the two - loop contributions to @xmath115 have the same size for @xmath109 . in this particular model",
    ", however , the sign of @xmath115 is always negative , what makes @xmath32 a decreasing function of @xmath2 and widens the range of energies with perturbative values of @xmath116 .",
    "actually , at two - loops all the gauge and the yukawa couplings except for @xmath117 decrease with the scale in such a way that the product @xmath118 is approximately constant at @xmath119 .",
    "we obtain that at @xmath120 @xmath121 .",
    "whether or not higher order corrections could change substantially the two - loop result is then unclear : a factor of 10 from the diagramatics at the next order could make @xmath122 .    in summary",
    ", our analysis shows that in models with an extra dimension the one - loop running of yukawa couplings is clearly insufficient , since higher order corrections can be just as important at scales few times above @xmath3 .",
    "although this type of large corrections vanish in the running of the gauge couplings , to claim unification one needs to make sure that @xmath32 stays perturbative up to the unification scale . in the particular models studied here the negative sign of the one and two - loop @xmath115 suggests that this is the case .",
    "but , since the expansion parameter is @xmath123 much below @xmath7 , gauge unification could still be spoiled by higher order corrections .",
