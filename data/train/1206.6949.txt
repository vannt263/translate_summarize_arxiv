    "massive gravtions exist in various models usually with extra dimensions . the compacification of extra - dimensional leads to kaluza - klein towers of particle spectrums .",
    "the lowest states of these towers usually are the sm particles , and the higher states represent these new heavy particles . with exact mass depending on the details of models , massive kaluza - klein particles are roughly at tev scale if heirarachy problem is solved . among them , massive gravitons serve as indispencible ingredients .      the field that describes a spin-2 particle is a tensor , @xmath7 . in a general effective theory with @xmath7 , all gauge invariant terms , both renormalizable and non - renormalizable , should be written down in the lagrangian .",
    "however , such a theory will have to too many free parameters to be considered .",
    "thus , in this paper , we should assume a minimal setup that massive graviton shall couple to standard model particles with universal form as same as the massless one , except with different strength and a non - zero mass .",
    "this universality is quite general as long as massive graviton is derived from the space - time metric .    for direct production at the lhc",
