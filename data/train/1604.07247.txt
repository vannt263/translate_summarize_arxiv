    "this note concerns completely - integrable systems of yang - mills - higgs equations , and in particular those which may be viewed as higher - dimensional generalizations of the two - dimensional hitchin equations ( the self - duality equations on a riemann surface ) .",
    "let us begin by briefly setting out the notation .",
    "we denote local coordinates on @xmath3 by @xmath4 with @xmath5 . for simplicity",
    "we take the gauge group to be su(2 ) throughout .",
    "a gauge potential @xmath6 takes values in the lie algebra @xmath7 , so each of @xmath8 is an anti - hermitian @xmath9 matrix .",
    "the curvature ( gauge field ) is @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "a higgs field @xmath11 takes values in the lie algebra , or , if complex , in the complexified lie algebra @xmath12 .",
    "its covariant derivative is @xmath13 $ ] , and gauge transformations act by @xmath14 .",
    "the prototype system is the simplest 2-dimensional reduction @xcite of the 4-dimensional anti - self - dual yang - mills equations @xmath15 this reduction can be written as a conformally - invariant system on the complex plane @xmath16 , or more generally on a riemann surface @xcite , and is effected as follows .",
    "if we take all the fields to depend only on the coordinates @xmath17 , and we define a complex coordinate @xmath18 and a complex higgs field @xmath19 , then ( [ sdym4 ] ) reduces to the hitchin equations @xmath20=0.\\ ] ] several higher - dimensional generalizations of ( [ h2 ] ) have been introduced and studied over the years . but most such generalizations lack a notable property of the original system ( [ h2 ] ) , namely its complete integrability .",
    "the purpose of this note is to describe some features , and some solutions , of an integrable @xmath21-dimensional generalization of ( [ h2 ] ) .",
    "let us focus specifically on generalizations to @xmath22 real ( or @xmath0 complex ) dimensions which involve @xmath22 real ( or @xmath0 complex ) higgs fields .",
    "such systems may naturally be viewed as dimensional reductions of pure - gauge systems in @xmath1 dimensions , satisfying linear relations on curvature such as ( [ sdym4 ] ) .",
    "of greatest interest are those that have the eigenvalue form @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is totally - skew , because the bianchi identities then imply that the gauge field satisfies the second - order yang - mills equations .",
    "perhaps the best - known example is the octonionic  system of @xcite , which has @xmath2 .",
    "this may be written @xmath25 whereas the prototype ( [ sdym4 ] ) is essentially based on the quaternions , this system ( [ octonion ] ) is based on the octonions : the components of @xmath24 are constructed from the cayley numbers .",
    "it is invariant under the group spin(7 ) , and its 7-dimensional reduction is invariant under @xmath26 .",
    "we now reduce to four dimensions by requiring the fields to depend only on the variables @xmath27 , defining two complex variables and two complex higgs fields by @xmath28 then the reduction of ( [ octonion ] ) is @xmath29 +          { \\tfrac{1}{4}}[\\phi_2,\\phi_2^ * ] & = 0 , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "f_{12}-{\\tfrac{1}{4}}[\\phi_1,\\phi_2 ] & = 0 ,   \\nonumber \\\\ d_{{\\bar{1}}}\\phi_1-d_2\\phi_2^*=0 ,   \\,\\ ,           d_{{\\bar{2}}}\\phi_1+d_1\\phi_2^ * & = 0 .",

    "the equations ( [ oct4 ] ) are more familiar in the @xmath36 ( real ) form @xmath37\\right)^+=0 , \\quad     \\left(d\\phi\\right)^-=0 , \\quad d*\\phi=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is a lie - algebra - valued 1-form formed from the four real higgs fields .",
    "the ` plus ' superscript denotes the self - dual part of a 2-form , and the ` minus ' superscript the anti - self - dual part .",
    "this system has appeared in several contexts over the years @xcite , and has variously been referred to as the non - abelian seiberg - witten equations or the kapustin - witten equations .",
    "known solutions include several obtained using a generalized t hooft ansatz @xcite .",
    "a different generalization of ( [ h2 ] ) , defined on any khler manifold , is one attributed to simpson @xcite . in @xmath0 complex dimensions , with complex coordinates @xmath39 , @xmath40",
    ", it takes the form @xmath41+\\ldots+        { \\tfrac{1}{4}}[\\phi_k,\\phi_k^ * ] & = 0 , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "f_{ab}=0 , \\,\\ , [ \\phi_a,\\phi_b]=0 , \\,\\ , d_{{\\bar{a}}}\\phi_b=0 .",
    "\\label{simp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that for @xmath42 , this system reduces to the prototype ( [ h2 ] )",
    ". for @xmath2 , it clearly it implies ( [ oct4 ] ) .",
    "the converse is not true in general , but it is if one imposes appropriate global conditions : in particular for smooth fields on a compact khler surface , it has recently been shown that ( [ simp ] ) and ( [ oct4 ] ) are equivalent @xcite .",
    "another approach to generalizing the basic 4-dimensional system ( [ sdym4 ] ) is to look for higher - dimensional versions which are completely - integrable @xcite . for simplicity , we begin with the case @xmath2 .",
    "an integrable 8-dimensional yang - mills system is @xmath43 which clearly implies the octonionic equations ( [ octonion ] ) .",
    "the system ( [ a4 ] ) has the symmetry group @xmath44/{{\\mathbb{z}}}_2\\subset{\\rm so(8)}$ ] , which corresponds to a quaternionic khler structure @xcite . the adhm construction of instantons @xcite generalizes to this case @xcite .",
    "consider now the reduction to four dimensions , with the same complex variables ( [ cxform ] ) as before .",
    "then ( [ a4 ] ) reduces to @xmath45=0 , \\,\\ , [ \\phi_a,\\phi_b]=0 , \\,\\ , f_{ab}=0 , \\,\\ , d_{[a } \\phi_{b]}=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath46 .",
    "this system is even more overdetermined than  ( [ simp ] ) .",
    "so we have a string of implications , where ( [ a4red ] ) implies ( [ simp ] ) implies ( [ oct4 ] ) implies the four - dimensional yang - mills - higgs equations ( the reduction of pure yang - mills from eight dimensions ) .    generalizing ( [ a4red ] ) to @xmath0 complex dimensions is straightforward : we simply allow the indices @xmath47 to range from @xmath30 to @xmath0 .",
    "the system ( [ a4red ] ) has a very large symmetry group , since it involves only the holomorphic structure of the underlying complex manifold .",
    "this becomes clearer if we define @xmath48 as a @xmath49-form with values in the complexified lie algebra : then ( [ a4red ] ) can be written @xmath50=0 , \\,\\ , [ \\phi\\wedge\\phi]=0 , \\,\\ , f^{2,0}=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath51 now denotes the covariant exterior derivative . by contrast , the less - overdetermined systems ( [ simp ] ) and ( [ oct4 ] ) depend on an underlying geometric structure , and have less symmetry .",
    "the system ( [ a4red ] ) is completely - integrable by virtue of being the consistency condition for a lax @xmath21-tet , namely @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a complex parameter .",
    "the integrability conditions @xmath54=0=[\\eth_a,\\eth_{{\\bar{b}}}]\\ ] ] for all @xmath53 are equivalent to the equations ( [ a4red ] ) .",
    "the aim now is to describe some solutions of ( [ a4red ] ) ; these will therefore also be solutions of the other systems ( [ simp ] ) , and ( [ kw ] ) in the @xmath2 case . the equations  ( [ a4red ] ) or ( [ a4red2 ] ) are defined on any @xmath0-dimensional complex manifold , and in general one may also allow singularities .",
    "for example , in the @xmath42 case on a compact riemann surface of genus @xmath55 , smooth solutions of ( [ h2 ] ) exist only when @xmath56 ; on the 2-sphere and the 2-torus , solutions necessarily have singularities @xcite .",
    "note that the functions @xmath57 are holomorphic , by virtue of the equations ( [ a4red2 ] ) . in what follows",
    ", we look for solutions which are smooth on @xmath58 , and for which @xmath59 is a polynomial in @xmath39 .",
    "so they may also be viewed as being defined on the projective plane @xmath60 , with a singularity on the line at infinity . to illustrate ,",
    "let us first consider the abelian case , with the fields being diagonal , namely @xmath61 , where @xmath62 .",
    "then the equations ( [ a4red2 ] ) are easily solved .",
    "the gauge field vanishes , and therefore we may take the gauge potential to vanish as well .",
    "the remaining equations give @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is an arbitrary polynomial on @xmath58 .",
    "this is the general abelian solution .",
    "for the non - abelian su(2 ) case , we adopt a simplifying ansatz which is familiar from the lower - dimensional version @xcite .",
    "namely let us assume that the gauge potential is diagonal : in other words , @xmath65 .",
    "( it should be emphasized that there are solutions for which this assumption does not hold . )",
    "then the general local solution is determined by a holomorphic function @xmath64 , plus a solution @xmath66 of the elliptic sinh - gordon equation @xmath67 in terms of these , the higgs fields are given by @xmath68 and the functions determining the gauge potential are @xmath69 note that one solution of ( [ sgeqn ] ) is @xmath70 , but this is effectively the abelian case of the previous paragraph . in order to get genuine non - abelian fields , we choose @xmath64 to have branch singularities , and then to get smooth fields one needs @xmath71 .",
    "the simplest such fields are embeddings of solutions of ( [ h2 ] ) on @xmath16 into @xmath58 , depending on @xmath39 only via a fixed linear combination @xmath72 . for example , @xmath73 gives an embedding of the one - lump  solution on @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "some simple solutions that are not of this embedded type are as follows .",
    "let @xmath74 be a polynomial of degree at least two , and take @xmath75 .",
    "this gives higgs fields of the form @xmath76 where @xmath77 satisfies @xmath78 we now need a smooth solution of ( [ sgeqn2 ] ) satisfying the boundary condition @xmath79 as @xmath80 .",
    "there exists a unique such solution , which is essentially a painlev - iii function @xcite .",
    "in fact , if we define @xmath81 , where @xmath82 , then ( [ sgeqn2 ] ) becomes an equation of painlev - iii type , namely @xmath83 this has a unique solution with the required asymptotics .",
    "the upshot is that any polynomial @xmath74 gives a solution of ( [ a4red2 ] ) which is smooth on @xmath58 and has @xmath84 it appears ( see for example the figure below ) that the gauge field @xmath85 is concentrated around the zero - set of @xmath86 . in the general @xmath0-complex - dimensional case ,",
    "one expects the gauge field to be concentrated around a submanifold of complex codimension  1 , and for the field to be approximately abelian elsewhere .",
    "the simplest case has @xmath86 quadratic , so that @xmath87 is a conic .     for @xmath88 , with @xmath89 and @xmath90 respectively . ]",
    "figure  1 is a plot of the norm @xmath91 of the gauge field , on the real slice @xmath92 , for the solutions corresponding to the choices @xmath89 ( on the left ) , and @xmath90 ( on the right ) . here",
    "@xmath91 is computed using the metric @xmath93 on @xmath58 , which leads to the formula @xmath94 the figures were generated by solving ( [ piii ] ) numerically to get @xmath95 , and then using this formula ( [ modf ] ) .",
    "clearly @xmath91 is concentrated around the conic @xmath87 .",
    "the right - hand case corresponds to a degenerate conic , and is the reduced version of what was called instantons at angles@xcite for solutions of  ( [ a4 ] ) .",
    "there are some compact complex manifolds @xmath96 on which smooth solutions of ( [ a4red2 ] ) exist . as a trivial example",
    ", one could take @xmath96 to be a product @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is a riemann surface of genus at least two , and @xmath99 is any other manifold : then a solution of ( [ h2 ] ) on @xmath98 is also a solution of ( [ a4red2 ] ) on @xmath97 .",
    "the moduli space of solutions on any compact manifold , if it is non - empty , has a natural @xmath100 metric , which on general grounds one expects to be hyperkhler .",
    "even more generally , one could allow singularities of a specified type , or equivalently for the ambient space to be non - compact . in this latter case",
    ", some of the parameters in the solution space may have @xmath100 variation , giving rise to a moduli space with a well - defined metric . analysing the possible moduli space geometries which arise in this way",
    "would be worthwhile , although a considerable task .    in this note",
    ", we have focused on a particular type of reduction of the integrable system ( [ a4 ] ) , and of its @xmath101-dimensional generalization .",
    "there are several other dimensional reductions of the octonionic system ( [ octonion ] ) which are of interest : see , for example , reference @xcite . in each case",
    ", the appropriate reduction of ( [ a4 ] ) gives an integrable sub - system , and hence a source of solutions .",
