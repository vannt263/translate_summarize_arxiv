    "the mertens function @xmath0 is important in number theory , especially the calculation of this function when its argument is large .",
    "@xmath0 is defined as the cumulative sum of the m@xmath3bius function @xmath4 for all positive integers @xmath5 ,    @xmath6    where the m@xmath3bius function @xmath4 is defined for a positive integer @xmath7 by    @xmath8    sometimes the above definition can be extended to real numbers as follows :    @xmath9    furthermore , mertens function has other representations .",
    "they are mainly shown in formula ( [ eq4]-[eq7 ] ) :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the the riemann zeta function , @xmath12 is complex , and @xmath13    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the farey sequence of order @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath16    formula ( [ eq6 ] ) shows @xmath0 is the sum of the number of points under n - dimensional hyperboloids .    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the redheffer matrix .",
    "@xmath19 is defined by @xmath20 if @xmath21 or @xmath22 , and @xmath23 otherwise .    however , none of the representations above results in practical algorithms for calculating the mertens function . at present , many algorithms are based or partially based on sieving similar to those used in prime counting ( eg . , kotnik and van de lune , 2004 ; kuznetsov , 2011 ; hurst , 2016 ) . with the sieve algorithm ,",
    "@xmath24 has been computed for all @xmath25(kuznetsov , 2011 ) . for the isolated values of mertens",
    "function @xmath0 , @xmath26 has been computed for all positive integers @xmath27 with combinatorial algorithm ( partially sieving ) ( hurst , 2016 ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "there are also some ( recursive ) formulae for mertens function @xmath0 in the mathematical literature by which the practical algorithms for the @xmath0 can be obtained ( eg . , neubauer , 1963 ; dress , 1993 ; benito and varona 2008 ; and the references therein ) .",

    "@xmath33 for @xmath34 .    here",
    "we introduce two new elementary formulae to calculate the @xmath0 which are not based on sieving .",
    "we calculate mertens function from @xmath35 to @xmath36 with these formulae one by one , and study some properties of the @xmath0 numerically and empirically .",
    "in wei ( 2016 ) , a definite recursive relation for m@xmath3bius function is introduced by two simple ways .",
    "one is from m@xmath3bius transform , and the other is from the submatrix of the redheffer matrix .    the recursive relation for m@xmath3bius function @xmath4 is ,    @xmath37    and @xmath38 .    from formula",

    "@xmath0 can be calculated directly and the most complex operation is only the mod .",
    "we calculated the mertens function from @xmath42 to @xmath43 one by one .",
    "some values of the @xmath0 are listed in table [ tb1 ] .",
    ".some values of the mertens function @xmath0 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tb1 ]",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the mertens function @xmath0 to @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , respectively . it can be found the distribution of mertens function @xmath0 is complicated .",
    "it oscillates up and down with increasing amplitude over @xmath5 , but grows slowly in the positive or negative directions until it increases to a certain peak value .",
    "fig1_m.eps    to investigate further the complicated properties of the @xmath0 , a sequence composed of @xmath48 is analyzed by the method of empirical mode decomposition ( emd ) ( tan , 2016 ) .",
    "this sequence is decomposed into a sum of 19 empirical modes .",
    "some models are shown in figure [ fig2]-[fig3 ] .",
    "it can be seen that the empirical modes are still complicated except 16th-19th modes . the fundamental mode ( the last mode in figure [ fig3 ] ) is a simple parabola going downward .",
    "these empirical modes show further that the mertens function @xmath0 has complicated behaviors .",
    "fig2.eps    fig3.eps    it can be found that there is a different variation of the mertens function @xmath0 with @xmath5 in a log - log space .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the absolute value of the mertens function @xmath49 to @xmath47 in such a space .",
    "it can be found @xmath49 still oscillates but increases generally with @xmath5 .",
    "it seems that the outermost values of @xmath49 increase almost linearly with @xmath5 , but they are less than those from @xmath50 .",
    "fig4_m.eps    it seems from figure [ fig1 ] and [ fig4 ] to the @xmath0 has some fractal properties .",
    "we check this by estimating @xmath0 s power spectral density ( psd ) .",
    "we calculate the psd for @xmath0 sequence from @xmath41 to @xmath51 by taking @xmath5 as time .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ fig4_add ] .",
    "it can be found that the logarithmic psd of @xmath0 has a linear decreasing trend with increasing logarithmic frequency , which does indicate that @xmath0 has some fractal properties . however , the m@xmath3bius function @xmath52 , which is taken as an independent random sequence in wei ( 2016 ) , has no such properties .",
    "its cumulative sum , @xmath0 reduces partly the randomness .",
    "fig4_add.eps      it is interesting to investigate the distribution of the zeros of the mertens function @xmath0 .",
    "our calculation shows that there are 16479 zeros among these @xmath2 values of the @xmath0 , which are shown in the top subfigure of the figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "it can be seen that the zeros are uneven in our computational domain .",
    "zeros are denser from 1 to @xmath53 , and at @xmath54 .",
    "the bottom subfigure of the figure [ fig5 ] shows the comparison of the zeros of the mertens function @xmath0 and those of the m@xmath3bius function @xmath52 in our computational domain .",
    "one can see that the ( 7841425 ) zeros of the @xmath52 are much denser than those of the @xmath0 .",
    "fig5_m.eps      another important property for the mertens function @xmath0 is the local maximum / minimum of the @xmath0 between two neighbor zeros . here",
    "the `` local '' means that the sequence of @xmath0 must have three values at least including the neighbor zeros .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] shows the variation of such 10043 local maximum / minimum of @xmath49 ( 5040 positive values and 5003 minus values ) from @xmath41 to @xmath51 with @xmath5 .",
    "one can see that the logarithms of the these local maximum / minimum have the similar properties to @xmath55 vs. @xmath56 in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "it should be pointed out that the local maximum / minimum here is counted only once when duplicate or more @xmath5 have the same local maximum / minimum between two neighbor zeros .",
    "the maximum of these @xmath2 @xmath0s is 1240 when @xmath57 , 10195467 , 10195468 , 10195522 ; and the minimum is @xmath58 when @xmath59 , 12875815 , 12875816 , 12875818 .",
    "in theory , we can calculate @xmath0 for any large @xmath5 with the relation ( [ eq9 ] ) or ( [ eq9_add ] ) obtained in section [ sec2 ] .",
    "the algorithm is not complicated and can be implemented easily , even by hand .",
    "the most operation is only mod .",
    "however , in order to calculate @xmath0 with the relation ( [ eq9 ] ) , it demands @xmath61 firstly , or @xmath41 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 if the relation ( [ eq9_add ] ) is used .",
    "above all , we have to recalculate @xmath65 or @xmath66 firstly when @xmath7 or @xmath5 changes .",
    "it will take a lot of calculation time , especially when @xmath5 is large .",
    "it took about 78326s to get @xmath67 .",
    "it can be also found that the relation here is not efficient for the isolated @xmath0 .    in this paper",
    ", we only calculate the values of @xmath0 from @xmath41 to m(@xmath68 because of the limitation of our desktop computer and computing time . to obtain more numerical results of @xmath0 with large @xmath5 , both",
    "the faster and/or optimization algorithm for the relation ( [ eq9 ] ) or ( [ eq9_add ] ) here , or other professional and efficient algorithms , are required .      in wei ( 2016 ) ,",
    "the upper bound of @xmath0 sequence is discussed based on the assumption that @xmath69 is an independent random sequence , because of the numerical consistency between empirical statistical quantities for only @xmath2 @xmath52 and those from number theory . the following inequality ( [ eq10 ] ) for @xmath0 holds with a probability of @xmath70 ,    @xmath71    where ,    @xmath72    or , the following inequality ( [ eq10_1 ] ) holds with a probability @xmath73    @xmath74    fig7_8.eps    here without taking @xmath69 as an independent random sequence , we conjecture that the upper bound of the @xmath0 should have a similar formula to ( [ eq10 ] ) or ( [ eq10_1 ] ) but the coefficient before @xmath50 will be very large from some facts as the follows :    * fact 1*. according to hardy and wright ( 2008 ) , we have ,    @xmath75    @xmath76    for a large @xmath5 , from ( [ eq11 ] ) we have ,    @xmath77    where @xmath78 is a constant .    then ,    @xmath79    according to ( [ eq12 ] ) , @xmath80 .",
    "we have ,    @xmath81    where @xmath82 is another constant for a large @xmath5 .",
    "further ,    @xmath83    comparing ( [ eq17 ] ) and ( [ eq13 ] ) , one can get ,    @xmath84    where @xmath85 is constant for a large @xmath5 .",
    "* fact 2*. according to hardy and wright ( 2008 ) , among the squarefree numbers those for which @xmath86 and those for which @xmath87 occur with about the same frequency for @xmath88 . since @xmath89 , we have ,    @xmath90\\ ] ]    @xmath91\\ ] ]    where @xmath92 is squarefree with even number of distinct prime factors , @xmath93 with odd number of distinct prime factors .",
    "thus , we have ,    @xmath94    @xmath95    where @xmath96 are two different constants for a large @xmath5 .    because those for which @xmath86 and those for which @xmath87 occur with about the same frequency among the squarefree numbers , @xmath97 for a large @xmath5 . and from ( [ ou2 ] ) and ( [ ji2 ] ) , we have ,    @xmath98    where @xmath85 is a constant for a large @xmath5 .       * fact 3*. from ( [ eq11 ] ) and ( [ eq12 ] ) , ( [ ou ] ) and ( [ ji ] ) , when @xmath5 is large , the following should be true :    @xmath99    @xmath100    the variations of @xmath101 and @xmath102 with @xmath5 from @xmath103 to @xmath47 are shown in figure [ fig7 ] , respectively",
    ". it can be found , with increasing @xmath5 , the values above are close to the constant @xmath104 .",
    "the absolute error for @xmath105 and @xmath106 to @xmath104 are @xmath107 and @xmath108 respectively .",
    "these above means that the order of the mertens function @xmath0 should be about @xmath109 , even @xmath110 with @xmath111 .",
    "if so , a better result in ramar@xmath112 ( 2013 ) can infer @xmath0 should be about @xmath113 for @xmath114 , even @xmath115 for @xmath116 .",
    "based on these three facts , we conjecture that @xmath0 should have a similar formula to ( [ eq10 ] ) or ( [ eq10_1 ] ) for the upper bound of the @xmath0 like the following ,       @xmath117 and @xmath85 is very large , @xmath118 , @xmath119    @xmath120",
    "based on the results and discussion above , some conclusions can be drawn as follows ,    \\(1 ) two elementary formulae for the mertens function @xmath0 are obtained , based on the definite recursive relation for m@xmath3bius function introduced in wei ( 2016 ) . with these formulae , @xmath0 can be calculated directly and simply .",
    "the most complex operation is only the mod .",
    "however , in the calculation both the efficient and/or optimization algorithm for this relation are required when @xmath5 is large .",
    "\\(2 ) with this relation , @xmath121 are calculated one by one .",
    "numerical results show that mertens function @xmath0 have complicated properties .",
    "the sequence of @xmath121 has 19 empirical modes , 16479 zeros , 10043 local maximums / minimums between two neighbor zeros , a maximum of 1240 , and a minimum of -1447 .",
    "\\(3 ) we also calculated the variation of @xmath122 and @xmath123 from @xmath103 to @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "numerical results show that these values are close to the constant @xmath104 with increasing @xmath5 .",
