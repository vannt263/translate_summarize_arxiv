    "electron - capture supernovae ( ecsne ) have been proposed as possible origin of elements beyond iron , in particular of heavy r - process elements .",
    "this is due to the distinctive features of the collapsing o - ne - mg cores @xcite .",
    "the cores with their fairly small mass ( @xmath21.38@xmath4 ) , steep surface density gradient , and dilute h / he envelope ( in the super - asymptotic - giant - branch or sagb stage ) were expected to enable prompt explosions , where the ejection of neutron(n)-rich matter with an electron fraction ( number of protons per baryon ) of @xmath5 could be possible @xcite .",
    "chemical evolution studies also favor ecsne at the lower end ( @xmath2810@xmath4 ) of the mass range of core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) to account for the abundance signatures of galactic halo stars @xcite .",
    "recent one - dimensional ( 1d ) hydrodynamic simulations of o - ne - mg core collapse with elaborate neutrino transport , however , found delayed neutrino - driven explosions @xcite .",
    "this result was confirmed by @xcite and excludes the prompt explosions of @xcite .",
    "the shocked surface layers of the o - ne - mg core are also far from the r - process conditions envisioned by @xcite as shown by @xcite .",
    "detailed nucleosynthesis studies based on the 1d results of @xcite , however , suggest that ecsne can be the source of nuclei up to @xmath1 , in particular of zn and light p - nuclei ( up to @xmath6mo ) , whose origins are not fully understood ( wanajo et al . 2009 ; see also hoffman et al .",
    "@xcite further speculated that the nucleosynthetic outcome could be considerably altered in the multi - dimensional case .",
    "spectroscopic studies of galactic halo stars indicate the presence of a significant fraction of r - process _",
    "deficient _ galactic halo stars that possess high sr - y - zr ( @xmath1 ) abundances relative to heavy r - process material @xcite .",
    "this implies the contribution from an astrophysical source making @xmath1 species without heavy r - process elements @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite , employing trajectories from 1d hydrodynamic models and varying the corresponding @xmath7 , proposed that the baryonic wind blown off the surface of new - born ( `` proto- '' ) neutron stars ( pnss ) by neutrino heating could be production sites of such nuclei in the early galaxy .",
    "new 2d explosion simulations of ecsne exhibit n - rich lumps of matter being dredged up by convective overturn from the outer layers of the pns during the early stages of the explosion (   2 ; mller , janka , & kitaura , in preparation ) , a feature that is absent in the 1d situation . in this _ letter _",
    "we present the first nucleosynthesis study on the basis of such self - consistent 2d models . without invoking any free parameters we show that ecsne could be an important source of the elements between the iron peak and the @xmath1 region in the sun and the early galaxy , perhaps even of light r - process nuclei up to cd .",
    "the nucleosynthesis analysis made use of about 2000 representative tracer particles , by which the thermodynamic histories of ejecta chunks were followed in our 2d hydrodynamic calculation of an ecsn .",
    "the model was computed with a sophisticated ( ray - by - ray - plus ) treatment of the energy - dependent neutrino transport , using the prometheus - vertex code and the same microphysics ( weak - interaction rates , nuclear burning treatment , and nuclear equation of state of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as in its 1d counterpart @xcite .",
    "some aspects of the 2d model in comparison to 1d results were discussed by @xcite , and a more complete description can be found in a separate publication ( mller et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "the pre - collapse model of the o - ne - mg core emerged from the evolution of an 8.8@xmath4 star @xcite . because of the very steep density gradient near the core surface ,",
    "the shock expands continuously , and a neutrino - powered explosion sets in at @xmath8ms p.b . in 1d and 2d essentially in the same way and with a very similar energy ( @xmath210@xmath9erg ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the multi - dimensional case",
    ", however , the negative entropy profile created by neutrino heating around the pns leads to a short phase of convective overturn , in which accretion downflows deleptonize strongly , are neutrino heated near the neutrinosphere , and rise again quickly , accelerated by buoyancy forces .",
    "thus n - rich matter with modest entropies per nucleon ( @xmath101315@xmath11 ; @xmath12 is boltzmann s constant ) gets ejected in mushroom - shaped structures typical of rayleigh - taylor instability .",
    "figure  [ fig:2dsnapshot ] displays the situation 262@xmath13ms after bounce when the pattern is frozen in and self - similarly expanding .    as a consequence ,",
    "the mass distribution of the ejecta in the 2d model extends down to @xmath3 as low as @xmath20.4 , which is significantly more n - rich than in the corresponding 1d case ( @xmath14 ) in the 1d case is highly sensitive to details of the neutrino transport , e.g.  the number and interpolation of grid points in energy space . in a recent simulation with improved spectral resolution , @xcite obtained @xmath15 . ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : massvsye ] shows the @xmath7-histograms at the end of the simulations .",
    "the total ejecta masses are @xmath16 for the 1d model and @xmath17 in 2d , where the difference is partly due to the different simulation times , being @xmath2800@xmath13ms and @xmath2400@xmath13ms , respectively ( core bounce occurs at @xmath250@xmath13ms ) . however , the ejecta after @xmath2250@xmath13ms p.b .  are only proton - rich , contributing merely to the @xmath18 side in fig .",
    "[ fig : massvsye ] .",
    "the nucleosynthetic yields are obtained with the reaction network code ( including neutrino interactions ) described in @xcite . using thermodynamic trajectories directly from the 2d ecsn model ,",
    "the calculations are started when the temperature decreases to @xmath19  k , assuming initially free protons and neutrons with mass fractions @xmath7 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "the final abundances for all isotopes are obtained by mass - integration over all 2000 marker particles .",
    "the resulting _ elemental _ mass fractions relative to solar values @xcite , or the production factors , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ecsnyields ] ( red ) compared to the 1d case ( blue ) from @xcite .",
    "the `` normalization band '' between the maximum ( 367 for sr ) and a tenth of that is indicated in yellow with the medium marked by a dotted line .",
    "the total ejecta mass is taken to be the sum of the ejected mass from the core and the outer h / he - envelope ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "note that the @xmath1 species , @xmath22kr , @xmath23rb , @xmath24sr , and @xmath25zr , have the largest production factors for _ isotopes _ with values of 610 , 414 , 442 , and 564 , respectively .    as discussed by @xcite , in the 1d case only zn and zr are on the normalization band , although some light p - nuclei ( up to @xmath6mo ) can be sizably produced .",
    "in contrast , we find that all elements between zn and zr , except for ga , fall into this band in the 2d case ( ge is marginal ) , although all others are almost equally produced in 1d and 2d .",
    "this suggests ecsne to be likely sources of zn , ge , as , se , br , kr , rb , sr , y , and zr , in the galaxy . note that the origin of these elements is not fully understood , although sr , y , and zr in the solar system are considered to be dominantly made by the s - process .",
    "the ejected masses of @xmath26ni ( @xmath27fe ; @xmath28 ) and all fe ( @xmath29 ) are the same as in the 1d case ( @xmath30 , * ? ? ?",
    "the fact that oxygen is absent in ecsn ejecta but a dominant product of more massive ccsne , can pose a constraint on the frequency of ecsne @xcite .",
    "considering the isotope @xmath22kr with its largest production factor in our 2d model and assuming @xmath31 to be the fraction of ecsne relative to all ccsne , one gets @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the mass fractions in the solar system @xcite , @xmath35 is our ejecta mass of @xmath22kr , and @xmath36 the production of @xmath37o by all other ccsne , averaged over the stellar initial mass function between @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "equation  ( 1 ) leads to @xmath40 .",
    "the frequency of ecsne relative to all ccsne is thus @xmath24% , assuming that all @xmath22kr in the solar system except for a possible contribution from the s - process ( 18% , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , originates from ecsne .",
    "this is in good agreement with the prediction from a recent synthetic model of sagb stars ( for solar metallicity models , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the remarkable difference between the 1d and 2d cases ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ecsnyields ] ) can be understood by the element formation in nuclear ( quasi-)eqilibrium .",

    "nuclear quasi - equilibrium ( qse ) makes nuclei heavier than the fe - group up to @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "@xmath41zn , @xmath24sr , and @xmath25zr are thus produced at @xmath460.49 , where the @xmath47-concentration ( at the end of the calculations ) is @xmath480.1 .",
    "the qse with abundant @xmath47 particles , however , is known to leave a deep trough in the abundance curve between @xmath4960 and 90 because of the strong binding at @xmath50 and 50 .",
    "this explains the substantial underproduction of elements around @xmath513337 in the 1d case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ecsnyields ] , blue line ) .    as the @xmath47-concentration becomes small , qse asymptotes to nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) .",
    "since nse with neutron excess ( @xmath52 ) leads to nuclei heavier than the fe - group up to @xmath53 @xcite , the trough can be filled by nse - abundances assembled in the n - rich ejecta lumps . the small @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) at @xmath560.42 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : massfractions ] ) is indicative of the consumption of almost all @xmath47-particles before freeze - out from nse .",
    "accordingly , qse asymptotes to nse in this @xmath7-range and yields substantial amounts of @xmath42ge , @xmath43se , and @xmath44kr ( made as @xmath42zn , @xmath43ge , and @xmath44se ) , nuclei that can not be created in @xmath47-rich qse .",
    "a similar result can be seen in the qse study by @xcite with entropies and @xmath7-values close to ours here ( see fig .  14 in their paper ) .    in the n - rich ejecta lumps nse ( or @xmath47-deficient qse ) conditions are established for several reasons .",
    "they have smaller entropies ( @xmath57@xmath58 per baryon ) than the other ejecta ( where @xmath59@xmath60 per baryon ; figs .",
    "[ fig:2dsnapshot],@xmath13[fig : massfractions ] ) .",
    "this favors @xmath47-particles to disappear when nse ends as the temperature drops .",
    "in addition , the @xmath47 s become easily locked up and tightly bound in nuclei , i.e. , their separation energies are large ( cf . , e.g. , fig .",
    "1b in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , because nuclei with n - excess do not readily release @xmath47 s to move farther away from @xmath61-stability .",
    "we find no sign of r - processing in the n - rich lumps .",
    "our present calculations are limited to the first @xmath62400@xmath13ms after bounce and do not include the neutrino - driven pns wind .",
    "the latter , however , turned out to have proton excess in 1d models of the long - term evolution of ecsne @xcite .",
    "it thus makes only p - rich isotopes with small production factors ( below unity , wanajo et al .",
    ", in prep . ) and has no effect on the discussed results .",
    "our results in   3 also imply that ecsne can be the source of sr , y , and zr as observed in r - process deficient galactic halo stars ( fig .",
    "[ fig : weakrprocess ] ) .",
    "a number of such stars with detailed abundance determinations indicate , however , a possible link with the elements beyond @xmath1 , e.g.  pd and ag @xcite .",
    "our ecsn models can not account for the production of such elements , but in their ejecta a small change of @xmath7 can drastically change the nucleosynthesis @xcite . due to limitations of the numerical resolution and the lack of the third dimension , or some sensitivity to the nuclear equation of state , it can not be excluded that ecsne also eject tiny amounts of matter with @xmath3 slightly lower than predicted by the 2d simulation .",
    "we therefore compare the nucleosynthesis for @xmath0 of our ecsn model and for artificially reduced values of @xmath63 , and 0.15 with the abundance patterns of representative r - process deficient ( hd  122563 , * ? ? ? * ) and enhanced ( cs  22892 - 052 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) stars ( fig .",
    "[ fig : weakrprocess ] ) . for",
    "that we use the thermodynamic trajectory of the lowest @xmath7 ( @xmath64 ) of the original model but apply @xmath7 down to 0.15 in steps of @xmath65 .",
    "the ejecta masses in these additional @xmath7-bins are chosen to be constant with @xmath66 in the cases @xmath67 and 0.30 , and @xmath68 for the other @xmath3 .",
    "figure  [ fig : weakrprocess ] shows that @xmath69 is needed to obtain elements beyond @xmath1 . a remarkable agreement with the abundance pattern in hd  122563 up to cd ( @xmath70 )",
    "can be seen for @xmath71 .",
    "such a mild reduction of @xmath3 in the ecsn ejecta is well possible for the reasons mentioned above .",
    "a reasonable match of the heavier part beyond @xmath70 requires @xmath72 .",
    "this , however , leads to a poor agreement for ag and cd .",
    "we therefore speculate that ecsne could be the sources of the elements up to cd in r - process deficient stars , and the heavier elements are from a different origin .",
    "moreover , @xmath73 is necessary to reproduce the abundance pattern of r - process enhanced stars like cs  22892 - 052 .",
    "such a low @xmath7 seems out of reach and disfavors ecsne as production sites of heavy r - process nuclei .",
    "we note that the neutron - capture reactions start from seeds with @xmath74 formed in nuclear equilibrium (   3 ) , not by an @xmath47-capture process .",
    "we therefore prefer to call the described process producing the elements beyond @xmath1 , presumably up to cd , `` weak r - process '' @xcite rather than @xmath47-process or charged - particle process @xcite .",
    "using ejecta - mass tracers from a self - consistent 2d explosion model we computed the nucleosynthesis of ecsne . because of",
    "a brief phase of convective overturn and the very fast explosion that is characteristic of o - ne - mg cores , n - rich lumps with @xmath7 down to 0.4 are ejected .",
    "these allow for a sizable production of the elements from zn to zr in nuclear ( quasi-)equilibrium . the model yields ge , sr , y , and zr in very good agreement with abundances of r - process deficient galactic halo stars .",
    "a mild reduction of the minimum @xmath7 to @xmath20.300.35 , which can not be excluded due to limited numerical resolution and the lack of the third dimension , leads to a weak r - process up to the silver region ( pd , ag , and cd ) , again well matching these elements in r - process deficient stars .",
    "the formation of heavy r - process nuclei requires @xmath7 to be as low as @xmath20.150.20 and seems out of reach for our models .    we therefore determine ecsne as an important source of zn , ge , as , se , br , kr , rb , sr , y , and zr in the solar system and the early galaxy . our models , however , underproduce ga , which suggests the s - process as the origin of this element .",
    "the frequency of ecsne is thus constrained to @xmath24% of all ccsn events on average over the galactic history , but could have been higher at early galactic epochs , compatible with the commonality of r - process deficient halo stars .",
    "future better resolved and in particular 3d models will have to elucidate the role of ecsne as site of the weak r - process . also important are new abundance studies of r - process deficient stars for more complete information on the elements from zn to zr and on weak r - process products between nb and cd .",
