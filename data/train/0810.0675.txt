    "in the space plasma turbulence , the presence of a mean magnetic field @xmath14 gives rise to anisotropies with respect to the field direction ( @xmath18 means parallel , and @xmath19 means perpendicular to @xmath14 ) .",
    "there are anisotropies both in the intensities @xmath20 of the magnetic fluctuations ( @xmath21 ) and in the distribution of their wave vectors @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) , i.e. , the energy distribution of the turbulent fluctuations is anisotropic in @xmath22space .    to study the anisotropy of turbulent fluctuations in space plasma , we chose here the earth s magnetosheath as a laboratory .",
    "downstream of the bow shock , the solar wind plasma slows down , and the plasma density , temperature and magnetic field increase in comparison with the solar wind plasma .",
    "the magnetosheath boundaries ( bow shock and magnetopause ) introduce an important temperature anisotropy @xmath24 , and therefore linearly unstable waves , such as alfvn ion cyclotron ( aic ) and mirror modes , are present ( see the reviews by schwartz et al . , 1996 ; lucek et al . , 2005 ; alexandrova , 2008 ) .",
    "in the vicinity of the bow - shock , an @xmath25 power law spectrum is observed at frequencies below the ion cyclotron frequency , @xmath26 , @xcite .",
    "the power law spectra @xmath27 , typical of the solar wind inertial range at @xmath26 , have not been observed in the magnetosheath .",
    "however , as in the solar wind , the energy of the magnetic fluctuations follows a power law close to @xmath28 at frequencies @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the question of the anisotropy of wave vectors in the magnetosheath has been mostly addressed for dominant frequencies in the turbulent spectrum ( spectral peaks ) , below @xmath4 , where linearly unstable modes are expected ( sahraoui et al .",
    "2004 ; alexandrova et al .",
    ", 2004 ; schfer et al . , 2005 ; narita et al . , 2006",
    "; narita and glassmeier , 2006 ; constantinescu et al . , 2007 ) .",
    "instead , we are interested in permanent fluctuations in the magnetosheath ( and not in spectral peaks ) which cover a very broad range of frequencies ( more than 5 decades ) , from frequencies well below @xmath4 to frequencies much higher than @xmath4 .    these permanent fluctuations within the frequency range @xmath29 $ ]  hz , above @xmath4 , and for one decade of scale lengths around cluster separations ( @xmath30  km ) , have been studied by sahraoui et al .",
    "( 2006 ) using the @xmath31-filtering technique . for a relatively short time interval in the inner magnetosheath ( close to the magnetopause ) and for a proton beta @xmath32 ,",
    "the authors show that the wave - vectors of the fluctuations are mostly perpendicular to the mean magnetic field @xmath14 , @xmath8 , and that their frequency @xmath33 in the plasma frame is zero . in the plane",
    "perpendicular to @xmath14 , the @xmath22-distribution is non - gyrotropic , more intense and with a well - defined power law @xmath34 in a direction along the flow velocity @xmath15 which was perpendicular to both @xmath14 and the normal to the magnetopause for this particular case .",
    "the presence of linearly unstable large scale mirror mode during the considered time interval makes the authors conclude that the small scale fluctuations with the observed dispersion properties @xmath8 and @xmath35 result from a non - linear cascade of mirror modes .    at higher frequencies ,",
    "@xmath36 $ ]  hz , between about the lower hybrid frequency @xmath37 and 10 times the electron cyclotron frequencie @xmath38 , the permanent fluctuations observed in the magnetosheath , during four intervals of several hours , have been studied by mangeney et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and lacombe et al .",
    "the corresponding spatial scales , @xmath39 $ ]  km @xmath40 kc/\\omega_{pe}$ ] ( @xmath41 being the electron inertial length ) , are much smaller than the cluster separations , and so only the one - spacecraft technique could be used to analyze the anisotropy of wave vector distributions .    magnetic fluctuations with @xmath7 , usually called _ slab turbulence _",
    ", have rapid variations of the correlation function along the field and weak dependence upon the perpendicular coordinates . for the fluctuations with @xmath8 , called _",
    "2d turbulence _ , the correlation function varies rapidly in the perpendicular plane , and there is no dependence along the field direction .",
    "so , measurements along different directions with respect to the mean field can give the information on the wave vector anisotropy .",
    "under the assumption of convected turbulent fluctuations through the spacecraft ( i.e. , the phase velocity @xmath42 of the fluctuations is small with respect to the flow velocity ) , these measurements are possible with one spacecraft thanks to the variation of the mean magnetic field @xmath14 direction with respect to the bulk flow @xmath15 . while @xmath43 , the spacecraft resolve fluctuations with @xmath44 , when @xmath45 , the fluctuations with @xmath46 are measured .",
    "this idea was already used in the solar wind for studying the wave vector anisotropies of the alfvnic fluctuations in the inertial range ( matthaeus et al . , 1990 ;",
    "bieber et al . ,",
    "1996 ; saur & bieber , 1999 ) .",
    "the authors suppose that the observed turbulence is a linear superposition of two uncorrelated components , slab and 2d , and both components have a power law energy distribution with the same spectral index @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the amplitudes of slab and 2d turbulent components , respectively .",
    "bieber et al .",
    "( 1996 ) propose two independent observational tests for distinguishing the slab component from the 2d component .",
    "the first test is based on the anisotropy of the power spectral density ( psd ) of the magnetic fluctuations in the plane perpendicular to @xmath14 , i.e. , on the non - gyrotropy of the psd at a given frequency in the spacecraft frame : in the case of a slab turbulence with @xmath44 , all the wave vectors suffer the same doppler shift depending on the angle between @xmath22 and @xmath15 , and if the spectral power is gyrotropic in the plasma frame , it will remain gyrotropic in the spacecraft frame ; in the case of a 2d turbulence , with @xmath46 , if the psd is gyrotropic in the plasma frame , it will be non - gyrotropic in the spacecraft frame because the dopler shift will be different if @xmath22 is perpendicular to @xmath15 and if @xmath22 has a component along @xmath15 .",
    "the second test reveals the dependence of the psd at a fixed frequency on the angle between the plasma flow and the mean field @xmath52 ( defined between @xmath53 and @xmath54 degrees ) : for a psd decreasing with @xmath31 ( like a power - law , for example ) , in the case of the slab turbulence , the psd for a given frequency will be more intense for @xmath55 , and therefore , the psd decreases while @xmath52 increases ; for the 2d turbulence the psd will be more intense for @xmath56 , and so it increases with @xmath52 . using these tests , bieber et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have shown that the inertial range of the slow solar wind is dominated by a 2d turbulence ; however , a small percentage of a slab component is present .",
    "mangeney et al .",
    "( 2006 ) proposed a model of anisotropic wave vector distribution without any assumption on the independence of the two turbulence components . in their gyrotropic model",
    ", the wave vector can be oblique with respect to the @xmath57 and @xmath58 directions .",
    "the authors introduce a cone aperture of the angle @xmath59 between @xmath22 and @xmath14 , as a free parameter of the model .",
    "they assume a power law distribution of the total energy of the fluctuations @xmath60 , with @xmath47 independent on @xmath59 . for a given @xmath31 ,",
    "the turbulent spectrum is modeled by one of the two typical angular distribution @xmath61 for @xmath22 nearly parallel to @xmath14 and @xmath62 for @xmath22 nearly perpendicular to @xmath14 .",
    "for these two distributions , the cone aperture of @xmath59 is about @xmath63 for @xmath64 and @xmath65 for @xmath66 .",
    "the angle @xmath59 can be easily represented through @xmath52 and so the model can be tested with one - spacecraft measurements .",
    "an advantage of the magnetosheath with respect to the solar wind in ecliptical plane is that the angle @xmath52 covers the range from @xmath67 to @xmath68 within rather short time periods ( one hour , or so ) while other plasma conditions remain roughly the same .",
    "a comparison of the model described above with the observations of the total psd of the magnetic fluctuations within the magnetosheath flanks , at frequencies between @xmath37 and @xmath69 , shows that these fluctuations have a strongly anisotropic distribution of @xmath22 , with @xmath70 ( mangeney et al . , 2006 ) . actually , this model ( as well as the tests of bieber et al . ,",
    "1996 ) is valid not only for a power law energy distribution in @xmath31 , but for any monotone dependence where the energy decreases with increasing @xmath31 .",
    "mangeney et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have also shown that the variations of @xmath20 with @xmath52 for a given frequency was not consistent with the presence of waves with a non - negligible phase velocity @xmath71 .",
    "in other words , if the observed turbulent fluctuations are a superposition of waves , their @xmath71 has to be much smaller than the flow velocity for any wave number @xmath31 .",
    "this is consistent with the assumption that the wave frequency @xmath33 is vanishing : the fluctuations are due to magnetic structures frozen in the plasma frame .",
    "these results have been obtained in the magnetosheath flanks for @xmath72  hz , at electron spatial scales @xmath73 kc/\\omega_{pe}$ ] .    in this paper",
    "we extend the study of mangeney et al .",
    "( 2006 ) to frequencies below 10 hz , for the same time periods in the magnetosheath flanks . as a result",
    ", we will cover the largest possible scale range , from electron ( @xmath74  km ) to mhd scales ( @xmath75  km ) . at variance with the previous study ,",
    "we analyse the spectral shapes and anisotropies for parallel ( @xmath76  compressive ) @xmath77 and for transverse ( @xmath76  alfvnic ) @xmath78 fluctuations independently . for alfvnic fluctuations @xmath78 we perform the first test of bieber et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , i.e. , we analyze the gyrotropy of the psd of the magnetic fluctuations in the plane perpendicular to @xmath14 , at a given frequency , as a function of @xmath52 .",
    "for our study we use high resolution ( 22 vectors per second ) magnetic field waveforms measured by the fgm instrument ( balogh et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "four seconds averages of the psd of the magnetic fluctuations at 27 logarithmically spaced frequencies , between @xmath79  hz and @xmath80  khz , are measured by the staff spectrum analyser ( sa ) ( cornilleau - wehrlin et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "plasma parameters with a time resolution of 4 seconds are determined from hia / cis measurements ( rme et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "high resolution fgm measurements allow to resolve turbulent spectra up to @xmath1  hz .",
    "similar to alexandrova et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , we calculate the spectra of the magnetic fluctuations in the gse directions x , y and z , using the morlet wavelet transform .",
    "the total power spectral density ( psd ) is @xmath81 .",
    "the psd of the compressive fluctuations @xmath82 is approximated by the psd of the modulus of the magnetic field .",
    "this is a good approximation when @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the modulus of the magnetic field at the largest scale of the analysed data set .",
    "the psd of the transverse fluctuations is therefore @xmath85 this approach , based on wavelet decomposition , allows the separation of @xmath78 and @xmath77 with respect to a local mean field , i.e. to the field averaged on a neighbouring scale larger than the scale of the fluctuations .",
    "the lower frequency limit of this approach is a scale where the ordering @xmath83 is no longer satisfied .",
    "the staff - sa instrument measures the spectral matrix @xmath86 at higher frequencies .",
    "because of a recently detected error about the axes directions in the spin plane ( o. santolik , 2008 , private communication ) we can not separate parallel and perpendicular spectra at the staff - sa frequencies ; however we present here the total psd , the trace of the spectral matrix .",
    "the motion of the plasma with respect to a probe allows a 1d analysis of the wave vector distribution along the direction of @xmath15 , as was discussed in section 1 .",
    "the 3d wave vector power spectrum @xmath87 depends on the wave number @xmath31 , on the angle @xmath59 between @xmath22 and @xmath14 , and on the azimuth @xmath88 of @xmath22 in the plane perpendicular to @xmath14 .",
    "if @xmath33 is the frequency of a wave in the plasma rest frame ( @xmath33 and @xmath89 are assumed to be positive ) , the doppler shifted frequency @xmath90 in the spacecraft frame is given by @xmath91 the trace of the power spectral density at this frequency is @xmath92 i.e. the sum of the contributions with different @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath93 is a normalisation factor and @xmath94 the dirac function .",
    "the angle @xmath59 can be considered as depending on the angle @xmath95 between @xmath22 and @xmath15 , the angle appearing in the doppler shift frequency , and on the angle @xmath52 between @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( see equation ( 2 ) of mangeney et al . , 2006 ) .",
    "thus , the variations of @xmath20 with @xmath52 for a given @xmath89 will give information about @xmath96 . as was discussed in section  1 , @xmath20 increases with increasing @xmath52 when the fluctuations have @xmath97 ( 2d turbulence ) and it decreases for a slab turbulence with @xmath98 ( see figure 6 of mangeney et al . , 2006 ) . as a consequence , in the case of 2d turbulence , the spectrum of the fluctuations will be higher for large angles @xmath52 than for small ones , and vice - versa for the slab geometry .",
    "to study the distribution of the psd @xmath101 in the plane perpendicular to @xmath14 , i.e. the gyrotropy of the magnetic fluctuations , taking into account the direction of the flow velocity @xmath15 , we shall consider the following reference frame ( @xmath102 ) : @xmath103 is the direction of the @xmath14 field , @xmath104 the direction of @xmath105 and @xmath106 the direction of @xmath107 .",

    "this can be due to several reasons : ( i ) @xmath170 is no longer a decreasing function with @xmath31 , ( ii ) @xmath171 is more isotropic in the spectral bump and/or ( iii ) the fluctuations are not frozen in plasma at this scale .",
    "this spectral bump , as we have already mentioned , can be the signature of alfvn vortices with @xmath97 , propagating slowly in the plasma frame .",

    "for which @xmath194 is between 0.8 and 4.5 , the kolmogoroff @xmath293 power law is observed below 0.06 or 0.1 hz , corresponding to scales @xmath294 ( see the vertical solid bar ) .    in figure 8f , for @xmath295 ,",

    "for such high @xmath194 , the mirror modes are more unstable than the aic waves , but they have an important alfvnic component ( gnot et al . , 2001 ) , that can also contribute to make fluctuations more isotropic .    above @xmath4 , the spectra @xmath146 and @xmath145 follow similar power laws , see figure  7 .",

    "the superposition of the background turbulence with the coherent structures , like magnetic vortices , can produce the observed steep spectrum .",
    "in figure 8c we do not observe any clear evidence for a power law spectrum in this frequency range .",
    "in the present paper , we have analysed six one - hour intervals in the middle of the terrestrial magnetosheath ( at more than one hour from the crossing of the bow shock or of the magnetopause ) . precisely , we considered intervals in the magnetosheath flanks : the local times for the three considered days are respectively 8 , 17 and 18  h ( lacombe et al . , 2006 ) .",
    "the proton beta varies from one interval to another , @xmath303 $ ] , that allows us to study the plasma turbulence in a very large range of plasma conditions .",

    "but in these studies , intervals of @xmath80  minutes have been analyzed , so the minimal resolved frequency is about @xmath306  hz . in the present paper ,",
    "the length of the intervals allows to reach frequencies smaller than @xmath307  hz .    here",

    "such a kolmogorov power law is observed in the alfvnic inertial range of the solar wind turbulence , below the spectral break in the vicinity of @xmath4 .",
    "the presence of such power law in the magnetosheath flanks is consistent with the estimations made by alexandrova ( 2008 ) : in the flanks , the transit time of the plasma is longer than in the subsolar regions , and it is much longer than the time of nonlinear interactions ; therefore , the turbulence has enough time to become developed .    in the high frequency range , @xmath9 ,",
    "we generally observe @xmath101 and @xmath310 following similar power law @xmath269 with a spectral index @xmath47 between @xmath311 and @xmath255 , in agreement with previous studies .",
    "we analysed here the anisotropy of wave - vector distribution of the magnetic fluctuations from @xmath307 to @xmath110  hz .",
    "this frequency range corresponds to the spatial scales going from @xmath1 to @xmath2  km ( from electron to mhd scales ) . for this analysis we used a statistical method , based on the dependence of the observed magnetic energy at",
    "a given frequency on the doppler shift for different wave vectors @xcite .",
    "within the inertial range of the magnetosheath turbulence ( @xmath26 , @xmath312 , @xmath313 ) , we do not observe a clear evidence of wave - vector anisotropy .",
    "it can be related to the fact that linearly unstable modes , such as aic modes with @xmath22 mainly parallel to @xmath14 and mirror modes with @xmath22 mainly perpendicular to @xmath14 , together with alfvn vortices with @xmath8 co - exist in this frequency range .",
    "however , above the spectral break in the vicinity of the ion characteristic scales ( @xmath9 , @xmath211 , @xmath314 and up to electron scales ) , we observe a clear evidence of 2d turbulence with @xmath8 for both @xmath78 and @xmath77 , and independently on @xmath194 , on the bow - shock geometry @xmath131 , and on the wave activity within the inertial range at larger scales .",
    "this wave vector anisotropy seems to be a general property of the small scale turbulence in the earth s magnetosheath .",
    "the range of wavenumbers of this 2d turbulence sometimes goes down to @xmath315 ( or even to @xmath316 ) , but usually it is limited by @xmath317 , while at @xmath312 spectral features ( peaks or bumps ) appear . as we can conclude from the work of mangeney et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , the largest wavenumbers of the 2d turbulence are observed around @xmath318 , where the dissipation of electromagnetic turbulence begins .",

    "this is valid for both the large scale inertial range and the small scale 2d turbulence .",
    "the dominance of @xmath158 happens only locally in the turbulent spectrum , indicating the presence of an unstable mirror mode .",

    "this non - gyrotropy might be a consequence of different doppler shifts for fluctuations with @xmath22 parallel and perpendicular to @xmath15 in the plane perpendicular to @xmath14 .",
