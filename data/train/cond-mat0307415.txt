    "computer simulations of the damage in diamond caused by the energetic displacement of a few c atoms resulting in damage to a small volume in diamond @xcite ( of 1.4 nm@xmath2 ) show that the size and nature of these regions depend on the initial recoil energy imparted to the c atoms and on the sample temperature . in some cases",
    "the formation of clusters of @xmath1 bonded c atoms forming a six - fold rings has been observed in these simulations .    in the present study",
    "we simulate the passage of a swift ion through a diamond or a diamond - like tetrahedrally bonded amorphous c layer ( @xmath3 ) by locally `` heating '' a section of the sample up to very high temperatures ( comparable to the temperatures expected to prevail in the thermal spike ) .",
    "we compute the @xmath1 and @xmath0 fractions in the affected volume and follow their evolution as a function of cooling rate and time .",
    "we find that , upon cooling , a region which contains both @xmath1 and @xmath0 bonded c forms along the track .",
    "the nature of the material in this regrown region depends on the initial heating of the track and on its cooling rate . under some conditions , complete regrowth back to perfect diamond is found , whereas in other cases , a @xmath1 rich region remains along the ion track .",
    "similar results are found when a thermal spike is simulated in amorphous carbon which is then allowed to cool down under a range of different conditions .",
    "the relevance of these computational results , obviously limited to small samples and to relatively short cooling times , to the actual ion passage through c based materials is discussed .",
    "we start below by briefly reviewing the physical processes involved in the formation of the thermal spike and the typical parameters of such a spike initiated in diamond by the passage of a swift heavy ion ; we then describe the computations performed , discuss their relevance to ion - implantation experiments ; present and discuss our results .",
    "the `` thermal spike '' which accompanies the passage of an ion through matter can be viewed as a short - time local melting of the ion damaged region followed by a rapid cooling .",
    "quenching from the liquid phase has been widely used to create amorphous materials ( including amorphous carbon ) in computer simulations , using empirical potentials @xcite , _ ab initio _ @xcite and tight - binding molecular dynamics @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that such a procedure produces an amorphous carbon similar to material produced experimentally by the deposition of a carbon film either by evaporation in an electron beam , by carbon arc @xcite or by ion beam deposition with ion energies between several ten and several hundred ev @xcite .",
    "in contrast to this large body of computer simulations of amorphous carbon , there have been only a few simulations of the material resulting from damaging diamond by ion - implantation .",
    "specific simulations of damage in material induced by ion implantation can be divided into two categories : ( i ) the commonly used trim code @xcite and ( ii ) the molecular dynamics ( md ) technique @xcite .",
    "the trim ( transport of ions in matter ) code is a monte carlo program that calculates the trajectories of the primary ion and of the recoiling host atoms involved in the irradiation event .",
    "the required input parameters are the ion type and energy and the properties of the host material i.e. its composition , density , and the displacement energy of the constituent atoms .",
    "trim provides good estimates of the damage and of the implant distributions and it is widely used in planning the dopant profile in ion - implantation experiments .",
    "however , trim can not account for the structure of the material ( amorphous vs. crystalline ) nor model the dynamic annealing of the implantation affected material .",
    "in particular , it can not predict the nature of the defects in diamond because of the variety of possible bonding configurations of carbon that may induce the diamond to graphite transition .",
    "a modification of trim has recently been developed by shaanan @xcite which enables following the evolution , in space and time , of the damage cascade caused by the passage of a single ion through matter .",
    "the results of the application of this code to simulate the passage of an 1mev xe ion through diamond show that extremely high temperatures ( of the order of many tens of thousand of degrees ) are induced during very short times ( less than 1 ps ) along the ion track . as we will discuss below ,",
    "these resemble the time / temperature regime modeled in our computations of the damage inflicted on diamond and @xmath3 by heavy ion irradiation .",
    "an md study of radiation damage caused by the passage of a single carbon atom through diamond was performed by wu and fahy @xcite , using the tersoff potential . in that study the computations",
    "were restricted to the investigation of the damage threshold energy necessary to displace a single c atom from its lattice site .",
    "smith @xcite simulated the results of the bombardment of diamond using a similar computational method but limiting the analysis to the ejection mechanisms of c atoms from a diamond surface ( carbon self - sputtering ) .",
    "@xcite have investigated the growth of @xmath4 layers . by computing the mean square displacement of the atoms during the cooling of the melt and the time required for it to relax ,",
    "the life - time of the thermal spike in diamond was found to be less than 1 picosecond , for ion impacts below 400 ev . in these latter study",
    "_ ab initio _",
    "md techniques were used .",
    "saada _ et al _ @xcite carried out md simulations , using the tersoff potential , of a damage region embedded inside a diamond matrix created by the energetic displacement of carbon atoms with a kinetic energy of up to 416 ev ( 8 times the displacement energy of carbon atoms in diamond ) in the bulk of a diamond crystal .",
    "such regions are likely to appear in diamond at the final stages of the implantation - related damage cascade .",
    "the conclusion of that study was that partial amorphization of a volume with a radius of 1 - 2 nm occurs around the stopping point of the recoiling ion . with an increasing number of successively displaced atoms ,",
    "the damage volume and the number of threefold coordinated atoms was found to increase .",
    "the structure of the damaged regions ( i.e. the ratio of @xmath1 and @xmath0 bonded c atoms ) was found in ref .",
    "@xcite to depend on the sample temperature .",
    "these computer studies strengthen our understanding of the processes occurring inside or at the end of an ion track in diamond .",
    "however , the transitions from @xmath0 to @xmath1 bonds within thermal spike regions have not yet been investigated in detail .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to investigate transformations of diamond and diamond - like amorphous carbon under the extreme conditions which prevail during and after the passage of a heavy fast ion through the materials .",
    "we present a simulations of the thermal spike which occurs during the passage of a heavy fast ion through either diamond or amorphous carbon by locally heating a slab of the material to very high temperatures and allowing it to rapidly cool down . a large increase in volume",
    "accompanies the @xmath0- to @xmath1 bond conversion @xcite , but the volume of the damaged region in the center of the diamond is restricted by the surrounding diamond ( or amorphous carbon ) lattice , therefore simulations are carried out under constant volume conditions . in order to set the temperature , a randomly directed velocity is assigned to each atom . the value of the velocity is randomly selected in accordance with a maxwell distribution for the desired temperature .",
    "the velocities can be rescaled to be related to the ambient temperatures .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are applied to the samples in all three directions . in order to describe the interactions between carbon atoms we use a tight- binding model @xcite , which has been shown to be transferable to successfully simulate different carbon polytypes : diamond , graphite , fullerenes @xcite as well as disordered carbon structures such as liquid and amorphous carbon phases @xcite .",
    "the md step was 0.5 @xmath5 10@xmath6 s.    the method used here to distinguish between @xmath0 and @xmath1 bonded atoms is based on determination of the coordination number of each atom .",
    "the radial distribution function ( rdf ) of all carbon samples exhibits a clear gap , centered at about 0.19 nm , separating the first and the second peak corresponding to the first and second neighbor shells .",
    "all atoms within the sphere of radius 0.19 nm are thus assumed to comprise the nearest neighborhood of a given atom .",
    "therefore , the number of neighbors of each atom within a distance of 0.19 nm determines the coordination number .",
    "atoms that have four nearest neighbors within this sphere are assumed to be @xmath0 bonded , while atoms which have only three are assumed to be @xmath1 bonded .",
    "the atomic visualization package ( * aviz * ) @xcite was used extensively in all stages of this project .",
    "a visualization of our carbon samples with color coding for different atomic bonding helped indentify clusters of either @xmath1 or @xmath0 coordinated atoms , rings , graphite - like planes .",
    "color pictures of the results of the present study can be found on the web site @xcite .",
    "six different samples with a density of 3.5 g / cc , initially arranged as a perfect diamond crystal , were prepared .",
    "their sizes were 2 @xmath5 2@xmath5 6 ( 192 atoms ) , 2 @xmath5 2@xmath5 7 ( 224 atoms ) , 2 @xmath5 2@xmath5 8 ( 256 atoms ) , 2 @xmath5 3@xmath5 6 ( 288 atoms ) and 3 @xmath5 3@xmath5 6 ( 432 atoms ) diamond unit cells .",
    "the `` thermal spike '' was created by heating the central layers up to `` temperatures '' of 1.2 - 2.6 ev ( 14000 - 30000 k ) .",
    "the 32 upper and 32 lower atoms of each sample ( the upper and lower layers of a height of 3.55  ) were frozen , i.e. the motion of these atoms was forbidden .",
    "the initial geometry of the samples is shown in fig .",
    "the outermost frozen diamond layers had the effect on their neighboring hot atoms of forcing them to return to their initial positions i.e. to regrow epitaxially back to diamond . in this way a temperature gradient from the edges to the center of the sample was created .",
    "once the liquid phase reached equilibrium ( this process was controlled by monitoring the total energy of the system ) , the central layers were cooled to room temperature at a cooling rate of 10 k / fs .",
    "the height of the hot layers varied between 4 and 6 diamond unit cells and the width of the hot layers varied from 2 to 3 diamond unit cells .",
    "the full time of cooling was 1.5 ps ( 3000 md steps ) .",
    "however , the central layers ceased to move after the 750 first md steps , so the lifetime of our `` thermal spike '' was 0.3 ps .",
    "this value is similar to the estimates of marks @xcite and saada @xcite , 0.2ps and 0.21ps , respectively .",
    "initial configuration of the samples ; grey ( purple ) balls represent the frozen atoms , white ( yellow ) balls represent atoms that are free to move .",
    "( purple and yellow are shown online ) ]      four initial samples of diamond - like amorphous carbon at density 3.5 g / cc were prepared by heating diamond up to 5000 k followed by cooling of the liquid phase to 300 k during 5 ps with an exponential cooling profile .",
    "each @xmath3 amorphous sample contained 192 atoms with a geometry 7.1 @xmath5 7.1 @xmath5 21.3  .",
    "the samples contained 66@xmath74 % of @xmath0 coordinated atoms . in order to achieve a larger percentage of @xmath0 coordinated atoms ( above 70 % ) ,",
    "two additional samples were prepared using the the following procedure : the amorphous structure was prepared with a density of 4.0 g / cc by quenching a liquid phase down from 10000 k to 700 k with a cooling rate of about 500 k / ps , then the density was reduced from 4 to 3.5 g / cc by uniform expansion , after which the temperature of the system was raised to 2500 k , and thereafter the structure was recooled to room temperature @xcite .",
    "the two structures obtained at a final density of 3.5 g / cc consisted of 84 % and 77.5 % of @xmath0 bonded atoms respectively .    to simulate a `` thermal spike '' in",
    "the diamond - like amorphous carbon samples , the central region of each sample was heated to `` temperatures '' of 1.2 - 2.60 ev per atom ( 14000 - 30000 k ) .",
    "the upper and lower layers of a height of 3.55 @xmath8 each , were kept frozen .",
    "for the six amorphous carbon samples the height of the hot layers was 14.2 @xmath8 ( 128 atoms in average ) .",
    "a representation of a typical initial sample geometry is given by figure [ init ] .",
    "dark atom at top and bottom indicate the frozen layers , the light central ones are free to move and when heated , there is a temperature gradient from the edges to the center of the samples . following the heating stage the structures",
    "were cooled to room temperature at a cooling rate of 10 k / fs .",
    "the time of calculations and the lifetime of the `` thermal spike '' were the same those described above for the case of the damaged region between two layers of perfect diamond .",
    "we checked carefully , by monitoring of the total energy of the system , that the heating time was sufficiently long to enable the liquid structure to reach equilibrium ( early attempts to prepare samples of amorphous carbon by quenching from a liquid carbon that was not in equilibrium led to inconclusive results ) .",
    "our aim is to determine the nature of transitions between different carbon bonds as the result of the passage of fast ions in samples of different initial structures . to do this ,",
    "we need to examine the region of passage and its intermediate neighbourhood on an atomistic scale .",
    "however , this microscopic region is contained in a larger carbon matrix , and while the microscopic region corresponds directly to that in the experiment , the surrounding matrix may differ in scale .",
    "we address the issues of system size and temperature in relation to the parameters of experimental samples .    in the simulations , on one hand , a maximum of 432 atoms can be contained in a single sample due to computational limitations . on the other hand , the periodic boundary conditions mean that the sample is in a sense infinite , and , in particular , has no surfaces .",
    "thus the simulation samples are both smaller and larger than the laboratory experiment .",
    "we are investigating the local region around the ion path ( which has a linear extent of 7.2 @xmath8 along the track directon prior to repetition ) .",
    "the geometry was chosen so that this region is well surrounded , in the direction perpendicular to the track , by diamond or amorphous carbon matrix , which is frozen in place .",
    "in particular , there are 7.4 @xmath8 between replicas of the tracks , a region that is sufficient to avoid interaction since the range of the potential is only 3  . in order to ensure that the samples are of sufficient size to enable reliable interpretations , a series of different sizes were used for each situation and the effect of the scaling of the system size was carefully investigated . although this is not exactly equivalent to the finite size scaling @xcite that is commonly applied to phase transitions and critical phenomena , and is closer to the scaling used by rosenblum et al @xcite in a study of thermal stress at diamond interfaces .",
    "the excellent agreement of both of these scaling approaches with results from laboratory experiments gives us confidence in the concept .",
    "the collapse , as a function of system size , and the smoothness of the scaling that will be demonstrated below confirms that the results can be reliably extrapolated even further if needed .",
    "temperature is introduced into the simulations as kinetic energy . in the laboratory",
    ", the region around the ion track is extremely hot for a very short time .",
    "the high heating `` temperatures '' of the simulation are thus large amounts of kinetic energy imported the heated atoms . here , too , we have studied the scaling of `` temperature '' with system size .",
    "not surprisingly , the actual `` temperature '' needed to attain specific structures is a function of system size .",
    "again , collapse of graphs to a single functional form will be demonstrated and provides validation of our approach .",
    "when the diamond lattice in the central hot layers was melted , @xmath1 and @xmath9 bonded atoms appeared in the liquid layers . upon cooling some ( or all ) of these @xmath1 and @xmath9 bonded atoms transformed back to @xmath0 coordinated c atoms .",
    "the final fraction of threefold and twofold coordinated atoms depends on the kinetic energy per atom ( `` temperature '' ) in the heating process .",
    "the higher the heating `` temperature '' of the atoms the larger was the ratio of @xmath10 , that prevailed after cooling .",
    "samples initially heated to a relatively low `` temperature '' returned to diamond , whereas for hotter samples some non diamond bonds remained after cooling .",
    "for example , let us consider the 2 @xmath5 2@xmath5 6 sample containing 192 atoms , 128 of which were free to move ( i.e. were heated and subsequently cooled ) .",
    "the percentages of four- , three- , and twofold coordinated atoms in the hot layers after cooling from different `` temperatures '' are presented in table [ tab141 ] . whenever the heating `` temperature '' was lower than 1.72 ev per atom all @xmath1 and @xmath9 bonds disappeared in the process of cooling , and the final , cooled , structure returned to a perfect diamond lattice , as shown in fig .",

    "after cooling , the central damaged region remained amorphous , but the @xmath10 ratio changed .",
    "the dependence of this generated structure on the heating `` temperature '' was similar to that of the previous stage of the simulation ( amorphous carbon between two layers of diamond ) .",
    "namely , if the central atoms were heated to higher `` temperatures '' , the fraction of the @xmath1 bonded atoms increased ( correspondingly , the fraction of the @xmath0 bonded atoms decreased ) . some of these structures were highly inhomogeneous , in particular when the initial sample contained a large fraction of fourfold bonded atoms and was heated to a relatively high `` temperature '' .",
    "in fig . [ amam ] the visualization of some of these amorphous carbon samples is presented .",
    "we can see that the frozen layers of the sample with 77.5 % of @xmath0 bonded atoms initially , contained after heating and subsequent cooling 75 % of @xmath0 bonded atoms , while the central layers after heating to 2.33 ev and subsequent quenching contained only 39 % of the fourfold atoms .",

    "the band gap measured for all the amorphous carbon samples became narrower when the population of @xmath1 bonded atoms increased .",
    "it vanished when the fraction of @xmath1 bonded atoms reached a value of 45 % . beyond this fraction",
    "the damage affected volume becomes conductive .",
    "the results obtained in this study support the experimental conclusions that in the damaged region formed after the passage of a heavy fast ion either through diamond or amorphous carbon , amorphization and sometimes conversion of @xmath0 bonds to @xmath1 bonds occurs .",
    "another conclusion which follows from the simulations is that after passing of a faster ( or heavier ) ion ( that corresponds to higher temperature of the `` thermal spike '' ) , the damaged region is larger and more @xmath0 bonds are transformed to @xmath1 .",
    "although the present simulations do not exactly reproduce the conditions of the experimental `` thermal spike '' , qualitatively our results are in good agreement with experiments .",

    "<S> we present tight - binding molecular dynamics simulations of the structural modifications that result from the `` thermal spike '' that occurs during the passage of a heavy fast ion through a thin diamond or amorphous carbon layer , and the subsequent regrowth upon cooling . </S>",
    "<S> the thermal spike and cooling down are simulated by locally heating and then quenching a small region of carbon , surrounded either by diamond or by a mostly @xmath0 bonded amorphous carbon network . for the case of the thermal spike in diamond </S>",
    "<S> we find that if the `` temperature '' ( kinetic energy of the atoms ) at the center of the thermal spike is high enough , an amorphous carbon region containing a large fraction of threefold coordinated c atoms ( @xmath1 bonded ) remains within the diamond network after cooling . </S>",
    "<S> the structure of this amorphous layer depends very strongly on the `` temperature '' of heating and on the dimensions of the thermal spike . </S>",
    "<S> scaling is found between curves of the dependence of the percentage of @xmath1 bonded atoms in the region of the thermal spike on the heating `` temperature '' for different volumes . </S>",
    "<S> when the thermal spike occurs in an initially amorphous sample the structure of the damaged region after cooling exhibits the above dependencies as well as being a function of the structure of the original amorphous carbon layers . </S>"
