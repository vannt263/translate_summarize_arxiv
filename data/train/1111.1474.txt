    "the planetary nebula ( pn ) ngc6369 possesses a double - shell morphology consisting of a round bright inner shell and a fainter filamentary outer shell or envelope @xcite .",
    "its most remarkable morphological features are two disparate extensions of the inner shell along the east and west directions ; the latter appears as a large , filamentary blister or _ ansae _ , whilst the former is a bifurcated structure .    using low - dispersion spectroscopy , @xcite modelled the peculiar morphology of ngc6369 as a tilted collar of gas and two symmetrically located caps of emission .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with the spheroidal shell and faint bipolar extensions proposed by @xcite based on a single long - slit high - dispersion spectrum obtained along the nebular major axis .",

    "the similarity of the h  i and he  ii zanstra temperatures suggests that the nebula is optically thick to h ionizing radiation , and thus that significant amounts of molecular material and dust may be present outside the ionisation bound optical nebula .",

    "the mid - ir morphology of ngc6369 is illustrated by the `` unsharp '' _ spitzer _ irac colour - composite picture presented in figure  [ ext_emission]-_right_. in this picture , the bright optical shell is the brightest feature , whereas the outer envelope and east and west extensions are fainter but still noticeable . despite the reduced spatial resolution , the mid - ir morphology of ngc6369 is consistent with that observed in the _ hst _ ( fig .",
    "[ hst.img ] ) and not ( fig  [ ext_emission]-_left _ ) optical images .",
    "the reddening of the eastern and western extension of the main shell and outer envelope in this colour - composite irac picture implies a higher relative contribution of 8.0 @xmath4 m emission at these morphological components .",
    "this is further evidenced by the contours in figure  [ irac_maps ] ; the inner ring is intense in all of the irac images , whereas the surface brightness of the envelope becomes relatively brighter at longer wavelengths , in the 5.8 and 8.0 @xmath4 m bands .",
    "the mid - ir surface - brightness profiles extracted from background - corrected irac images through the minor and major axes of the nebula ( figure  [ prof.plot ] ) confirm this result .",

    "one final point is related to the relative intensities of the pah bands themselves .",
    "the 7.8 @xmath4 m feature arises primarily through c - c stretching modes , whilst the 11.3 @xmath4 m band is a consequence of c - h out - of - plane bending modes .",
    "this would normally lead to i(7.8@xmath4m)/i(11.3@xmath4m)@xmath351.3 for neutral pahs , but radiation fields in pne are capable of appreciably ionising the pah molecules , reducing the strength of the 11.3 @xmath4 m feature and leading to i(7.8@xmath4m)/i(11.3@xmath4m)@xmath3512 for fully ionised pahs @xcite .",

    "the close resemblance between the images and surface brightness profiles in the 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath4 m irac channels is due to the prominence of ionic and h  i transitions in these two bands .",
    "the higher relative emission in the 5.8 and 8 @xmath4 m bands at large radial distances implies that molecular material and cool dust , responsible of pah bands and continuum emission , are important at the eastern and western extensions of the inner shell and at the envelope , whilst ionic lines dominates the emission from the bright inner shell .",
    "the relative increase of 5.8 and 8.0 @xmath4 m , [ n  ii ] , and h@xmath0 emission at the interior of the bright inner shell most likely reveal an opening of the inner shell at its polar caps , so that the emission detected at this region comes from regions far from the nebular center , above and below the bright inner shell .    finally , we noted in  [ ext_sec ] that the blobs and knots of diffuse emission outside the main nebular shells are detected in the optical [ n  ii ] , near - ir h@xmath0 , and irac 8 @xmath4 m images . since these blobs present both emission from ionised ( n@xmath36 ) and molecular ( h@xmath0 ) material , and the irac 8 @xmath4 m band of the main nebula is dominated by pah bands and dust continuum , the origin of the emission in the irac 8 @xmath4 m band may be multi - fold .",
    "the [ ar  iii ] @xmath138.991 @xmath4 m line is the brightest ionic line in this band , but the ionization potential of ar@xmath37 ( ip=27.6 ev ) is higher than this of n ( ip=14.5 ev ) and thus ar@xmath38 may be not present in these regions . indeed ,",
    "the lack of [ o  iii ] emission , whose ip(o@xmath37 ) is 35.1 ev , indicates that only low - excitation species are present in these regions . since no emission from these blobs is detected in the irac 5.8 @xmath4 m image , it seems unlikely that pah bands or dust continuum produce the emission detected in the irac 8 @xmath4 m image , although we concede that the levels of dust continuum and pah emission in the irac 5.8 @xmath4 m may be lower than in the irac 8 @xmath4 m band .",
    "given the previous difficulties for ionic , pah or continuum emission and that near - ir h@xmath0 1@xmath190 s(1 ) emission is detected , we favor the h@xmath0 0@xmath190 s(4 ) @xmath138.0251 @xmath4 m emission line as the responsible for the emission from these blobs in the irac 8 @xmath4 m image .",
    "figure  [ pv.img ] displays the individual h@xmath6 and [ n  ii ] position - velocity ( pv ) maps of ngc6369 obtained from the five slits positions illustrated in fig .  [ slits.img ] .",
    "overall , the h@xmath6 and [ n  ii ] lines show similar kinematical features , but these are best seen in [ n  ii ] given that its thermal broadening is smaller than that of the h@xmath6 line .",
    "the radial velocity of the source with respect to the local standard of rest was determined to have a value @xmath39kms@xmath9 , based on the mean expansion velocity at the position of the central star .",
    "this result is in excellent agreement with the value of @xmath40kms@xmath9 reported by @xcite .",
    "the line shapes of the echellogram at slit position # 2 , which cuts the nebula along the east and west extensions , is closely similar to that presented by @xcite : the east and west extensions are detected as red- and blue - shifted loops , respectively , and their shape is typical of the emission in bipolar outflows",
    ". the structure of the h@xmath6 line may give the false impression that the inner shell is a closed ellipsoid , but the sharper view offered by the [ n  ii ] line reveals that the loops of the east and west extensions emanate from gaps at the tips of the inner shell .",
    "the eastern extension is mapped in more detail by the slits at positions # 3 , # 4 , and # 5 . in the echellograms at positions # 4 and # 5 ,",
    "this extension is detected as a red - shifted loop , as expected for a blister - like structure .",
    "however , the echellogram at position # 2 reveals a waist and two open loops that are indicative of a more complex structure .",
    "previous three - dimensional modeling of ngc6369 @xcite concur that this nebula has a bipolar structure , although the details make them differ significantly .",
    "@xcite obtained spatially - resolved information of the physical conditions within the nebula that , in conjunction with a photo - ionization model , allowed them to synthesize narrow - band images . in order to match the morphology observed in several emission lines , they adopted for ngc6369 a clumpy hourglass structure with a thick equatorial belt and two symmetrically located caps of emission whose orientation is tilted by 30@xmath30 from the symmetry axis of the main nebula . on the other hand , @xcite used a single high - dispersion long - slit spectrum of ngc6369 obtained along its major axis to illustrate the capabilities of _ `` shape '' _ , an interactive 3-d modeling tool . using a hubble - type ( @xmath41 ) expansion law for ngc6369 , as it is typically assumed in pne ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , they concluded that there is no equatorial waist in ngc6369 , but its three - dimensional structure can rather be described by a partial spheroidal shell with opened tips at its major axis from where two fainter blisters protrude as the east end west extensions .",
    "m , together with the ranges corresponding to the 3.6 @xmath4 m ( solid profile ) and 4.5 @xmath4 m ( dashed profile ) _ spitzer _ irac channels . ]",
    "our more detailed spatial coverage of the kinematics of ngc6369 allows us to refine @xcite s model and to investigate the spatio - kinematical structure of the nebular envelope . using the latest version of the code _ shape _ ( version 10 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we have constructed a spatio - kinematical model for ngc6369 which fits its narrow - band images and pv maps .",
    "the quality of the fit can be judged in figure  [ model1 ] that presents a comparison between the synthetic morphology and kinematics from the model and those observed in ngc6369 . the synthetic image of ngc6369 ( right image of the upper panel in fig .  [ model1 ] )",
    "is well matched with its _ hst _ h@xmath6 image ( left image ) .",
    "similarly , the kinematics of ngc6369 are fairly reproduced as shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ model1 ] which presents the pv for slits # 2 to # 5 accompanied by the corresponding pv map extracted from the model .",
    "our best fit model , illustrated in figure  [ model2 ] , is composed of : + @xmath42 an equatorial barrel with expansion velocity @xmath2055 km  s@xmath9 and whose axis of symmetry is inclined by @xmath550  with respect to the line of sight ( rlos ) , + @xmath42 a southern lobe approaching to us with an inclination angle @xmath540  ( rlos ) and polar expansion @xmath2060 km  s@xmath9 , and + @xmath42 two northern lobes with inclination angles @xmath5115  and @xmath5127  receding from us with polar expansion velocities @xmath2077 and @xmath2084 km  s@xmath9 , respectively .",
    "+ in this way , the physical structure of ngc6369 is reminiscent of other barrel - shaped pne with polar extensions that result in a spindle shape ( e.g. , ngc3918 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .",
    "according to this model and for the distance of 1,550 pc proposed by @xcite , the kinematical ages of the barrel and bipolar lobes are @xmath202,000  yrs and @xmath203,200  yrs , respectively .",
    "the kinematical age of the inner shell is thus smaller than that of the bipolar lobes , most likely indicating important dynamical effects that have made the kinematical and real ages to differ .",
    "these dynamical effects may also be revealed by the distorted eastern structure whose complex shape would arise from the interaction of an expanding , regular lobe with extended and irregular material along its direction .",
    "alternatively , this bifurcated structure may arise from intrinsic multipolar collimated outflows as has been claimed in other pne @xcite .",
    "the emission from the outer envelope of ngc6369 is registered by the slits at positions # 1 , # 3 , # 4 , and # 5 , although the echellograms at positions # 3 and # 4 only cover a small fraction of this shell . in the echellograms at positions # 1 and # 5 , the h@xmath6 and [ n  ii ] lines are extremely narrow , with @xmath43 and @xmath44 km  s@xmath9 , respectively .",
    "we note , however , that the velocity centroid along these lines is not constant : the echellogram at position # 1 shows a weavy pattern ( best seen in the [ n  ii ] line ) , whereas at position # 5 displays an arc - like shape .",
    "we measure velocity differences up to 17 km  s@xmath9 .",
    "we also note that emission is patchy , especially in the [ n  ii ] line .",
    "clearly the envelope is not inert , but the narrow and weavy / arced line shape does not comply with the expectations for an expanding shell , even if it had the low expansion velocity @xcite presumed for the slow agb wind . the knotty and fragmented appearance of the envelope of ngc6369 indicate that the kinematics revealed by the echellograms is governed by the emission from individual knots , rather than by the emission from a continuous shell .",
    "this situation is reminiscent of many other pne where bright low - ionization knots are embedded within a faint envelope around a bright inner shell , e.g. , ngc2392 and ngc7354 @xcite . as for these two pne ,",
    "the relatively low velocity differences measured for the knots of the envelope of ngc6369 would suggest that they lay at different latitudes with respect to the symmetry axis of the barrel , but mostly on a weavy disk - like or flattened structure , as for ngc2392 and ngc7354 .      the relative sizes of the regions dominated by ionized material and molecules and dust are illustrated in figure  [ prof.han2h2i4i8 ] that displays the normalized surface brightness profiles in the _ hst _ h@xmath6 and [ n  ii ] , wht liris h@xmath0 , and _ spitzer _",
    "irac 4.5 and 8.0 @xmath4 m images .",
    "the comparison between these profiles confirms that the surface brightness profiles of the inner shell of ngc6369 of the optical h@xmath6 emission line and mid - ir irac 4.5 and 8.0 @xmath4 m bands are very similar in shape and extent .",
    "the mid - ir and optical profiles start to depart from each other at the edge of the inner shell : the emission from h@xmath6 and [ n  ii ] drops considerably in an annular region between 20  and 25  ( i.e. , the inner regions of the envelope ) , while the emission in the irac 4.5 and 8.0 @xmath4 m bands stays higher and the h@xmath0 profile shows increased emission . on the contrary , on the 2535  outer rim of the envelope , the emission in the h@xmath6 and [ n  ii ] lines is enhanced , while the emission in the irac 4.5 and 8.0 @xmath4 m bands flattens and then decays smoothly .",
    "there is no h@xmath0 emission in this range of radial distances .",
    "the comparison of the relative shapes and extents of these different surface brightness profiles is relevant to the understanding of the physical structure of ngc6369 .",
    "its inner shell is mostly ionized and thus the emission in the irac 4.5 and 8.0 @xmath4 m bands is dominated by ionic emission .",
    "the shell is enclosed by a series of `` tadpole '' or `` cometary '' knots whose prominent low - excitation [ n  ii ] and molecular h@xmath0 emission at their heads result in bright [ n  ii ] and h@xmath0 peaks at @xmath2013 .",
    "the inner shell is surrounded by a region dominated by molecular material , the inner rim of the envelope between @xmath517   and @xmath525 .",
    "this region , outside the bright inner shell and beyond the annular region defined by the tails of the `` cometary '' knots , seems to be a real pdr .",
    "the relative brightening of the emission in the irac 4.5 and 8.0 @xmath4 m bands at these radial distances is very likely due to molecular h@xmath0 emission , although a contribution from continuum dust or pah emissions is also very likely as noted in other pne ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . finally , the outer rim of the envelope is again dominated by ionic emission , but we note that low - excitation emission dominates .",
    "this may explain the flattening of the emission in the irac 4.5 and 8.0 @xmath4 m emission due to an additional contribution of ionic emission .",
    "it is finally worth noting that sources with comparable he  ii and h  i zanstra temperatures are likely to be ionisation bound and enveloped by a shell of neutral material .",
    "this leads to a correlation between the zanstra ratio t@xmath45(he  ii)/t@xmath45(h  i ) , and mid - ir extent outside of the ionised shell ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "ngc6369 seems to be a peculiar case of this correlation : whereas the emission from molecular material causes a larger dimension of its inner shell at mid - ir wavelenghts , the presence of ionized material in its singular envelope results in very similar final optical and mid - ir dimensions .      in ",
    "[ neb_morp_sec ] we noted the large jump in the [ n  ii ] to [ o  iii ] ratio at the filamentary structures that enclose the eastern and western extensions of the inner shell of ngc6369 .",
    "given that these structures are at the tips of bubble - like structures that may arise from bipolar outflows , it is very likely that the unusually high [ n  ii]/[o  iii ] ratios stem from shock interactions of these structures with surrounding material . to investigate the structure of these features in more detail ,",
    "we show in figure  [ fig.shocks ] a radial profile across a particularly bright filament of the eastern extension extracted from the _ hst _ h@xmath6 , [ n  ii ] , and [ o  iii ] images and ratio maps .",
    "the comparison of the surface brightness profiles indicates that the peak of all these three emission lines are almost coincident , but the spatial profile of the [ o  iii ] line is noticeable broader .",
    "the inner shoulder of this profile , closer to the central star ( negative offsets in fig .",
    "[ fig.shocks ] ) , can be explained as the result of a higher photo - excitation .",
    "the shoulder of the line farther away from the nebula , however , can not be explained in this way and it very likely reveals the presence of a forward shock propagating onto a lower density medium .",
    "the [ o  iii]/h@xmath6 ratio profile in the lower - panel of fig .  [ fig.shocks ] allows us to derive a quantitative value for the spatial extent of this post - shock region , @xmath46 . at the distance of 1,550",
    "pc , this corresponds to @xmath53@xmath710@xmath47 cm , comparable to the post - shock cooling widths determined from modelling of shocks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there is a growing number of pne in the literature that show knots or blobs of emission well separated from their main nebular shells that do not form a halo . in some cases ,",
    "the kinematics of these knots imply high - velocity collimated outflows , e.g. , fleming  1 @xcite or mycn18 @xcite , while in some others , e.g. , ic4634 @xcite , the velocity of the knots is close to the systemic velocity , may be due to motions close to the plane of the sky .    as for ngc6369 , we note that one of the blobs located outside its inner shell and envelope is detected in the h@xmath6 and [ n  ii ] emission lines at the slit position # 1 ( fig .",
    "[ slits.img ] ) .",
    "this blob , at an offset of @xmath570from ngc6369 central star , has a relatively small velocity shift , @xmath5 + 17 km  s@xmath9 , with respect to the systemic velocity , and its velocity width is small , @xmath48 in h@xmath6 and @xmath49 km  s@xmath9 in [ n  ii ] .",
    "the kinematical properties of this outer condensation make ngc6369 closer to the case of the lower velocity knots of ic4634 than to a case of high - velocity collimated outflows .",
    "meanwhile , the velocity shift , although small , would preclude that these outer condensations are part of an incomplete halo ( as , e.g. , the case of ic4593 , * ? ? ?",
    "the origin of these external condensations is uncertain , but they may probe earlier , point - symmetric ejections , or arise from shocks associated with the east - west that excite material surrounding the nebula .      the spatio - kinematical model of the inner shell of ngc6369 , the kinematics of its envelope , and the intrincate distributions of ionized , molecular , and mid - ir emission can be used to obtain a coherent view of its structure . the inner shell and extensions of ngc6369",
