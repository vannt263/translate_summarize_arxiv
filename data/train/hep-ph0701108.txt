    "the inner structure of the scalar mesons in terms of quarks is still an open question in particle physics and it is the subject of an intense and continuous theoretical and experimental investigations for establishing their their nature ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "there are numerous scenarios for the classification of the scalar mesons .",
    "the established @xmath4 mesons are divided into two groups : 1 ) near and above @xmath5 , and 2 ) in the region @xmath6 .",
    "the first group scalar mesons form an @xmath7 nonet , which contains two isosinglets , an isotriplet and two strange isodoublets . in the quark model , the flavor structure of these scalar mesons would be    [ e8201 ] > |nn > - |ss >  , + f_0 > |ss > + |nn >  , + a_0 ^ 0 ( |uu - |dd )  ,  a_0^+ = u |d  ,   a_0 ^ - = |d u  , + ^+ |su  ,  |^0 = |ds  ,  ^- = |us  , where @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the mixing angle . here",
    "we take into account the fact that between isoscalars @xmath10 and @xmath11 there is mixing , which follows from experiments .",
    "indeed the observation ( j / f_0 ) ( j / f_0 )  , indicates that the quark content of @xmath12 is not purely @xmath10 state , but should have non ",
    "strange parts too @xcite . secondly ,",
    "if @xmath12 is purely @xmath10 state , then @xmath13 should be ozi suppressed .",
    "but the decay width of @xmath12 is dominated by @xmath13 which leads to the conclusion that in @xmath12 there should be @xmath14 parts as well .",
    "therefore @xmath3 should be a mixture of @xmath10 and @xmath14 , as is presented in eq .",
    "( [ e8201 ] ) .",
    "analysis of the experimental data shows that the mixing angle @xmath9 lies in the range @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "although there is another scenario where mesons below or about @xmath5 is described as a four  quark state ( see for example @xcite ) , in this work we restrict ourselves to considering the @xmath17 description for @xmath12 meson , but taking into account the mixing between @xmath10 and @xmath14 . in the present work we study",
    "the semileptonic decays @xmath18 , @xmath19 decays in order to get information about the quark content of @xmath12 .",
    "from theoretical point of view , investigation of the semileptonic decays is simpler compared to that of hadronic decays , because leptons do not participate in strong interactions .",
    "the experimental study of weak semileptonic decays of heavy flavored mesons is very important for the more accurate determination of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements , their leptonic decay constants , etc .",
    "the precise determination of the ckm matrix elements depends crucially on the possibility of controlling long distance interaction effects .",
    "so , in study of the exclusive semileptonic decays the main problem is calculation of the transition form factors , which involve the long distance qcd dynamics , belonging to the non  perturbative sector of qcd .",
    "for this reason , in calculation of the transition form factors some kind of non  perturbative approach is needed . among all non  perturbative approaches",
    "qcd sum rules method @xcite is more powerful , since it is based on the first principles of qcd .",
    "about the most recent status of qcd sum rules , the interested readers are advised to consult @xcite .",
    "semileptonic decays @xmath20 @xcite , @xmath21 @xcite , @xmath22 @xcite , @xmath23 @xcite , @xmath24 @xcite and @xmath25 @xcite are all studied in the framework of 3point qcd sum rules method .    in this work",
    "we study the semileptonic @xmath26 and @xmath27 decays in the 3point qcd sum rules method .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we derive the sum rules for the form factors , responsible for pseudoscalar to scalar meson transition .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the numerical analysis of the transition form factors and discussion and contains our conclusions .",
    "pseudoscalar  scalar transition form factors are defined via the matrix element of the weak current sandwiched between initial and final meson states @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the relevant quarks , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the pseudoscalar and scalar meson states , respectively .",
    "it follows from parity conservation in strong interaction that only axial part of weak current gives non  zero contribution to this matrix element , and imposing lorentz invariance , it can be written in terms of the form factors as follows : [ e8202 ] s ( ) |q_1 _ ( 1-_5 ) q_2 p(p ) = - i  , where @xmath33 .",
    "for evaluation of these form factors in the qcd sum rule , we consider the following the 3point correlation function [ e8203 ] _ ( p^2,,q^2 ) = - d^4x d^4y e^i(y - px ) 0 t\\ { j_s(y ) j_^a(0 ) j_p(x ) } 0  , where , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the interpolating currents of scalar and pseudoscalar mesons , and weak axial currents , respectively .",
    "it should be noted here that , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 for the @xmath40 transition ; and @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 for the @xmath44 transition , respectively .    the decomposition of the correlation function ( [ e8203 ] ) into the lorentz structures , obviously , has the form [ e8204 ] _ = _ + ( p+)_+ _ -(p- ) _  .    for the amplitudes @xmath45 and @xmath46",
    ", we have the following dispersion relation [ e8205 ] _ ( p^2,,q^2 ) = - +  , where @xmath47 is the corresponding spectral density and @xmath48 . according to qcd sum rules approach , the correlation function is calculated by the operator product expansion ( ope ) at large euclidean momenta @xmath49 and @xmath50 on one side , and on the other side it is calculated by inserting a complete set of intermediate states having the same quantum numbers with the currents @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the phenomenological part of ( [ e8203 ] ) is obtained by saturating correlator it with the lowest pseudoscalar ( in our case @xmath53 , @xmath54 or @xmath55 mesons ) and scalar",
