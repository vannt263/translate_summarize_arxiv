    "this paper is concerned with weak galerkin ( wg ) finite element methods by exploring optimal use of polynomial approximating spaces . in general ,",
    "weak galerkin refers to finite element techniques for partial differential equations in which differential operators ( e.g. , gradient , divergence , curl , laplacian ) are approximated by weak forms as distributions .",
    "the main idea of weak galerkin finite element methods is the use of weak functions and their corresponding discrete weak derivatives in algorithm design . for the second order elliptic equation ,",
    "weak functions have the form of @xmath4 with @xmath5 inside of each element and @xmath6 on the boundary of the element .",
    "both @xmath7 and @xmath8 can be approximated by polynomials in @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively , where @xmath11 stands for an element and @xmath12 the edge or face of @xmath11 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are non - negative integers with possibly different values .",
    "weak derivatives are defined for weak functions in the sense of distributions . for computing purpose , one needs to approximate the weak derivatives by polynomials .",
    "for example , for the weak gradient operator , one may approximate it in the polynomial space @xmath15^d$ ] .",
    "various combination of @xmath16^d)$ ] leads to different class of weak galerkin methods tailored for specific partial differential equations .",
    "the goal of this paper is to explore optimal combination of the polynomial spaces @xmath9 and @xmath10 that minimizes the number of unknowns without compromising the rate of convergence for the corresponding wg method .    for simplicity",
    ", we demonstrate the idea of optimality for polynomials by using the second order elliptic problem that seeks an unknown function @xmath17 satisfying @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a polytopal domain in @xmath20 ( polygonal or polyhedral domain for @xmath21 ) , @xmath22 denotes the gradient of the function @xmath17 , and @xmath23 is a symmetric @xmath24 matrix - valued function in @xmath19 .",
    "we shall assume that there exists a positive number @xmath25 such that @xmath26 here @xmath27 is understood as a column vector and @xmath28 is the transpose of @xmath27 .",
    "a weak galerkin method has been introduced and analyzed in @xcite for second order elliptic equations based on a _ discrete weak gradient _ arising from local _ rt _ @xcite or _ bdm _ @xcite elements .",
    "more specifically , in the case of _ bdm _ element of order @xmath29 , the gradient space is taken as @xmath15^d\\equiv [ p_k(t)]^d$ ] and the weak functions are defined by using @xmath30 . for the _ rt _ element of @xmath31 ,",
    "the gradient space is the usual _ rt _ element for the vector component while the weak functions are given by @xmath32 . due to the use of the _ rt _ and _ bdm _ elements ,",
    "the wg finite element formulation of @xcite is limited to classical finite element partitions of triangles ( @xmath33 ) or tetrahedra ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "in addition , the corresponding wg scheme exhibits a close connection with the standard mixed finite element method for ( [ pde])-([bc ] ) .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to investigate the possibility of optimal combination of polynomial spaces that minimize the number of unknowns in the numerical scheme without compromising the order of convergence .",
    "the new wg scheme will use the configuration of @xmath35 , and the corresponding wg solution converges to the exact solution of ( [ pde])-([bc ] ) with rate of @xmath36 in @xmath2 and @xmath37 in @xmath3 norm , provided that the exact solution of the original problem is sufficiently smooth .",
    "it should be pointed out that the unknown @xmath7 associated with the interior of each element can be eliminated in terms of the unknown @xmath8 defined on the element boundary in practical implementation .",
    "this means that , for problems in @xmath38 , only edges of the finite element partition shall contribute unknowns ( @xmath39 unknowns from each edge ) to the global stiffness matrix problem .",
    "the new wg scheme is , therefore , a natural extension of the classical crouzix - raviart @xmath40 non - conforming triangular element to arbitrary order and arbitrary polygonal partitions .",
    "it have been proved rigorously in @xcite that @xmath41 type of polynomials can be used in weak galerkin finite element procedures on any polygonal / polyhedral elements .",
    "it contrasts to the use of polynomials @xmath41 for triangular elements and tensor products @xmath42 for quadrilateral elements in classic finite element methods . in practice ,",
    "allowing arbitrary shape in finite element partition provides a great flexibility in both numerical approximation and mesh generation , especially in regions where the domain geometry is complex .",
    "such a flexibility is also very much appreciated in adaptive mesh refinement methods .",
    "another objective of this paper is to study the reliability , flexibility and accuracy of the weak galerkin method through extensive numerical tests .",
    "the first and second order weak galerkin elements are tested on partitions with different shape of polygons and polyhedra .",
    "our numerical results show optimal order of convergence for @xmath43 on triangular , quadrilateral , honey comb meshes in 2d and deformed cube in 3d .",
    "one close relative of the wg finite element method of this paper is the hybridizable discontinuous galerkin ( hdg ) method @xcite .",
    "but these two methods are fundamentally different in concept and formulation .",
    "the hdg method is formulated by using the standard mixed method approach for the usual system of first order equations , while the key to wg is the use of discrete weak differential operators . for the second order elliptic problem ( [ pde])-([bc ] ) , these two methods share the same feature of approximating first order derivatives or fluxes through a formula that was commonly employed in the mixed finite element method . for high order pdes , such as the biharmonic equation @xcite ,",
    "the wg method is greatly different from the hdg .",
    "it should be emphasized that the concept of weak derivatives makes wg a widely applicable numerical technique for a large variety of partial differential equations which we shall report in forthcoming papers .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ section : weak - gradient ] , we shall review the definition of the weak gradient operator and its discrete analogues . in section [ section : wg - fem ]",
    ", we shall describe a new wg scheme .",
    "section [ section : wg - massconservation ] will be devoted to a discussion of mass conservation for the wg scheme . in section [ section : l2projections ] , we shall present some technical estimates for the usual @xmath3 projection operators .",
    "section [ section : error - analysis ] is used to derive an optimal order error estimate for the wg approximation in both @xmath2 and @xmath3 norms . finally in section [ section : numerical ]",
