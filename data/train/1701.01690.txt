    "the increase in the computer power and advances in numerical modeling have recently made it possible to simulate the propagation of radiofrequency plasma waves using first - principle particle - in - cell ( pic ) algorithms .",
    "in particular , there has been a growing interest in pic modeling of the x - b conversion @xcite , i.e.,a transformation of an externally - launched electromagnetic x wave into an electron bernstein wave ( ebw ) , which is useful for depositing energy into the dense core of tokamak plasmas @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , an instability was observed in such simulations that results in a parametric decay of an x wave into an ebw and a lower - hybrid wave ( lhw ) .",
    "the existing theory of this instability @xcite is limited to relatively low amplitudes and assumes that the ebw and lhw are inhomogeneous and propagate at nonzero group velocities .",
    "( for other relevant studies , see refs .",
    "this involves delicate assumptions about how thermal effects enter the wave dispersion relation .",
    "but the simulation results in ref .  @xcite indicate that the instability is a robust cold - plasma effect and is experienced by homogeneous waves too .",
    "hence , a different theory is needed to explain those results explicitly and also to provide a more robust description of the effect in general .    here",
    "we propose such theory . by using a variational approach",
    ", we derive the instability rate @xmath0 through the cold - plasma linear susceptibility .",
    "this approach is advantageous in the sense that nonlinear ponderomotive forces on the plasma , which are somewhat complicated , do not need to be calculated .",
    "our theoretical predictions for @xmath0 are in reasonable agreement with simulation results in ref .",
    "we also extend the theory to higher amplitudes , when the wave interaction is not quite resonant , and @xmath0 is a nonlinear function of the x - wave amplitude .",

    "hats @xmath2 are used to denote nonlocal ( differential or integral ) operators . also , for any @xmath3 , the notation `` @xmath4 '' will denote that the corresponding equation represents an euler - lagrange equation ( ele ) obtained by extremizing the action functional @xmath5 with respect to @xmath3 .",

    "we consider a process in which an x wave ( a `` pump '' ) scatters into an ebw and a lhw approximately under the conditions of the three - wave resonance : @xmath29 that being said , we allow the lhw envelope to evolve in time at a rate comparable to @xmath30 .",
