    "it is known from studies of neutral hydrogen absorption in @xmath1-ray burst ( grb ) afterglows , that they probe much higher column densities than qso sightlines , almost certainly because grbs probe the star - forming environments in which they are born .",
    "the highest column density grb damped ly@xmath0 absorbers ( dlas ) are higher than any known qso - dla , in spite of the much larger qso - dla sample .",
    "measurements of the column density ( @xmath3@xmath4 ) are needed to determine abundances in grb environments where the metal column densities are known either from absorption lines of non - refractory elements such as zn , or from the soft x - ray absorption which is dominated by @xmath0-chain elements in gas and solid phases .",
    "the optical observations are complicated by the need to assume that certain elements are not depleted by dust , and the need for high - resolution spectra .",
    "the x - ray measurements do not suffer from these problems , but do not provide a strong redshift constraint on the absorber . however using the x - ray metal column densities with ly@xmath0 columns has been extremely difficult because of the conflicting redshift requirements and has not yet been done in any object at @xmath5 other than a grb . to detect hydrogen ly@xmath0",
    "1216  with ground - based instruments we need @xmath6 to shift the line into the sensitivity range of optical / uv spectrographs .",
    "but the soft x - ray absorption moves further and further out of the bandpass as we go to higher redshift , such that once the neutral oxygen edge at 0.52kev is no longer detectable , there is typically a degeneracy between the redshift and the total absorption column that scales roughly as @xmath7 .",
    "thus we need a high x - ray column density ( greater than a few @xmath8 ) for it to be detectable at @xmath6 .    with the advent of the _ swift _ satellite and its highly successful x - ray telescope ( xrt ) , very early , largely complete , and high flux observations of grb x - ray afterglows",
    "have been obtained for about ninety grbs every year .",
    "this means that the sample of grb afterglow x - ray absorption column densities has increased enormously , such that we now have limits on the extragalactic x - ray absorption for almost every new grb discovered and we finally have a few grb damped ly@xmath0 systems ( grb - dlas ) where we can compare with significant detections of extragalactic soft x - ray absorption : see grb050401 @xcite , grb050505 @xcite , and grb050730 .    in this _",
    "we present the sample of grb - dlas with significant extragalactic x - ray absorptions and compare the column densities obtained with each method .",

    "_ swift _ grbs at @xmath13 were examined by to determine the properties of grb - dlas . from that sample bursts with well - constrained columns were selected .",
    "we analysed xrt data from these bursts where they were believed to have x - ray absorption in excess of galactic from the literature or the _ swift _ data table.[multiblock footnote omitted ] analysis was done in a standard way .",
    "spectra were fit with a power - law with absorption fixed at the galactic value and a second absorber at the host redshift .",
    "where the count rate was high , regions with the psf - core excised were used for spectral analysis to account for pile - up .    to ensure that only statistically significant excess absorption columns were selected , two conservative criteria were applied .",
    "1 ) grbs at low galactic latitude ( @xmath14 ) were excluded .",
    "2 ) the excess column density had to be detected above the 99.7% confidence level when the @xmath15 absorber was fixed at @xmath16@xmath17 or 20% above the galactic value , whichever was larger .",
    "galactic column densities obtained from the newer survey of were consistent with those obtained from within @xmath18@xmath17 . at early times",
    "an absorbed power - law model fit occasionally yields excess absorption not present at later times . @xcite",
    "have examined the reasons behind this and we discuss it in  [ discussion ] . because of this effect we adopt the lower value of absorption where inconsistent values were found at early and later times .",
    "grbs050730 , 050820a , and 060714 are the bursts affected by this , and we have adopted absorption values from the later pc mode spectra for these bursts .",
    "the spectra of grbs050401 , 050505 , 050730 and 050904 have been presented elsewhere . for the bursts with persistent excess absorptions published previously050319 , 050401 , 050505 , and 050904we obtain somewhat different values .",
    "this may be due to the more recent calibration used in this analysis .",
    "however , in each case , the authors claim a detection of excess absorption and adopting those values do not change our conclusions .",
    "seventeen grbs enter our sample as set out in table  [ tab : columns ] .",
    "the comparison of x - ray and and hydrogen ly@xmath0 absorption is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xrayoptical ] .",
    "if the metallicities of grb formation sites are low , we would expect to make no significant detections of excess absorption in this sample .",
    "instead , eight grbs have significant excess column densities : grbs050319 , 050401 , 050505 , 050904 , 060210 , 060607a , 060714 , and 060926 ( see table  [ tab : columns ] and fig .",

    "the best limits that can be placed on the column density from _ swift_-xrt data above @xmath23 is roughly @xmath24 .",
    "[ fig : xrayoptical ] is therefore not populated below 21.5 in x - ray column .",
    "such a limit could only constrain the metal abundance to be less than solar in the highest column density cases .",
    "upper limits obtained in the optical / uv are more interesting : grb060607a has a tightly constrained , low column density , but large x - ray absorption .",
    "( the same is true for grb060124 , but it does not enter our sample at @xmath25 . )    there is evidence of a spread in the metallicities of grb hosts , though with most fairly close to @xmath26% of the solar value . if the metallicities of grb environments were all approximately similar we would expect some correlation between the optical and x - ray column density determinations .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : xrayoptical ] that there is no such correlation and that the optical - to - x - ray ratios span a range of at least a few hundred .",
    "furthermore , the metal abundances derived by this comparison indicate metallicities far above the solar values .",
    "the extreme abundances and the lack of correlation between the optical and x - ray values are disturbing and strongly imply that the x - ray absorption and the ly@xmath0 absorption are sampling different environments .",
    "these data immediately show that for grbs the x - ray - to - optical absorption ratio is not a useful measure of the metallicity .",
    "metal abundances have been determined for intervening extragalactic absorbers in a few radio - loud agn using x - ray and ly@xmath0 absorption .",
    "those values are significantly below solar ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the metallicities are consistent with extinction measures and expectations for these objects . for the crab pulsar ,",
    "this technique yields values consistent with solar metallicity .",
    "both these results are plotted for comparison on fig .",
    "[ fig : xrayoptical ] and indicate that in general the comparison of column densities from x - ray and ly@xmath0 is valid for both galactic and extragalactic sources .",
    "grb afterglows exhibit curvature close to the cooling frequency , which may be at x - ray wavelengths at certain times and may mimic absorption . @xcite",
    "have shown that in many cases where the soft x - ray absorption apparently changes rapidly in the first few hundred second after the burst , this may be better explained by curvature of the continuum than ionisation of the absorber . this seems a reasonable explanation in the early phases of some bursts .",
    "such early curvature however , should not affect the results presented here , as we have used absorption values from later spectra where early ( high ) values of the absorption are inconsistent with later data .",
    "such an approach is conservative , in the sense that it leads to lower column densities . in general ,",
    "spectral curvature is not responsible for the detection of excess absorption .",
    "most of the bursts in question have early wt and pc mode data that agree on the absorption to within 1@xmath27 despite large spectral changes .",
    "given that the technique is reliable , could it be that the galactic column densities are underestimated ?",
    "this explanation can be ruled out .",
    "first of all we have excluded any excess column density that is not significant above the 90% variations of the galactic columns .",
    "furthermore solar abundances were used to convert the galactic 21 cm column densities , resulting in a high ( conservative ) estimate of the foreground galactic column , higher than is often argued for the galactic gas by e.g.@xcite .",
    "a large underestimate of the galactic column density can also be excluded on the basis of observations of blazars with _",
    "bepposax _ that show no substantial absorption compared to the values of . of nearly 90 blazars examined with _",
    "bepposax _ only 17 showed excess absorption in the observed 0.150kev spectra and even these excesses are small , @xmath28@xmath17 . finally ,",
    "if the excess columns were due to galactic foreground absorption , we would expect a systematic rise in observed column densities with redshift , an effect we do not observe when we combine with the lower - redshift values of .",
    "it is only with the success of _ swift _ that we have been able to obtain ly@xmath0 and x - ray absorption measures in the same bursts . given the expectations for neutral hydrogen column densities surrounding grbs @xcite , few significant detections of excess absorption in the x - ray afterglows of grbs should have been expected above @xmath6 .",
    "it is expected that high redshift sources will often have intervening line of sight absorbers .",
    "the x - ray absorption does not tell us about the redshift of the absorber and some absorption could in principle be related to low-@xmath29 systems .",
    "the observed absorption in x - rays drops substantially as the absorber is moved to higher redshift , so for this to be an effective explanation any absorber would have to be at relatively low redshift .",
    "however , very large column densities of metals would routinely be required along most lines of sight at low redshifts .",
    "recently , @xcite have shown that grbs have intervening large column density ( w@xmath30 ) absorbers about four times more frequently than qsos . and",
    "it is a suggestive coincidence that grbs also have significant excess soft x - ray absorptions .",
    "however , to explain the results observed here with intervening absorbers is not possible .",
    "this would require an absorber with typically @xmath31 at @xmath32 ( assuming @xmath33 ) in half of the grb sightlines  an extremely large value .",
    "assuming that an absorber with w@xmath34  corresponds to @xmath35 at this metallicity @xcite , the required absorption is roughly two orders of magnitude above that provided by the absorbers seen in grbs at @xmath36 @xcite . to reinforce this point ,",
    "a similar excess of large equivalent width absorbers is also found in the foregrounds of blazars @xcite , which , as noted above , do not have large x - ray absorptions .",
    "this is an important difference in that it seems likely that grbs and blazars sample similar column densities of intervening absorbers , but grbs typically have large soft x - ray absorptions and blazars do not , showing that the large absorptions are indeed intrinsic to the grb hosts .",
    "it has been suggested that the lack of very high column density and apparent overabundance of low column density sources in comparison to model predictions may be due to ionisation of the hydrogen near the grb .",
    "this hypothesis explains the results found here ; the hydrogen may be ionised to large distances by the early afterglow , but the metals , while also ionised , will not be stripped to such an extent that they cease substantially to absorb the soft x - rays .",
    "this hypothesis is also consistent with the lack of expected wolf - rayet features in most grb optical afterglows @xcite .",
    "it is possible to limit the size of the gas cloud where most of the hydrogen has been ionised by the grb .",
    "a maximum distance to the gas is found by assuming the x - ray column density represents the total column density ( it can not obviously be smaller than this , and if it is larger , then the ionisation radius will be smaller ) and that each ionising uv photon is intercepted by a hydrogen atom ( if this is not the case , the radius will again , necessarily be smaller ) .",
    "since we know the total uv fluence for most of these bursts is a small fraction of the prompt energy , we can derive a maximum distance to which the grb could have ionised the gas . in all cases ,",
    "this is less than @xmath2pc .",
    "interestingly , if the gas cloud is already ionised by the massive stars in the region , the typical densities of regions ( @xmath37@xmath38 ) yield sizes which are also at most a few parsecs in radius .",
    "smaller radii require higher densities .",
    "radii an order of magnitude greater than this make the total masses unfeasibly large .",
    "this radius is similar to that obtained by @xcite based on the assumption that the apparent decreasing absorption detected in grb050904 is due to ionisation by the grb .",
    "observations of uv absorption lines have allowed distances to low - ionisation gas to be derived that are far larger than the maximum distance to the majority of the gas column we derive above .",
    "@xcite find @xmath39pc for in grb050111 , and @xcite find @xmath40kpc for and in grb060418 .",
    "gas with high ionisation states closer to the grb has been detected in the optical @xcite .",
    "though 1.7kpc seems large to be the typical distance scale between clouds in most bursts , taken together , those results support our conclusion in this paper , that the optical / uv spectra are probing gas that is outside the pc - scale structure in which the grb explodes .",
    "we have examined the x - ray afterglow spectra of the sample of _ swift _ grbs at @xmath13 as defined by and compared their extragalactic soft x - ray absorbing column densities to the host column densities .",
    "we find no correlation between the column density values , and the x - ray absorptions often far exceed the column densities .",
    "the most likely explanation for this discrepancy is that grbs substantially ionise the hydrogen in their immediate environments ( at least along the line of sight ) .",
    "this may be consistent with the sublimation of the dust that is expected ( by analogy with the local universe ) to be associated with large x - ray column densities , though it does not provide evidence in favour of dust sublimation .",
    "it seems likely that significant information about the immediate circumburst environment may be gleaned from high - resolution x - ray spectroscopy of the very early afterglow , probably revealing the complex absorption pattern associated with metal - rich warm absorbers , as observed in some agn .",
    "finally , we find the maximum distance for the bulk of the absorbing material surrounding the grbs to be @xmath2pc for these bursts , similar to the sizes of compact regions . since the distances inferred from optical observations are typically larger than this , it implies that the optical / uv spectroscopy of grb afterglows typically probes environments that are little affected by the progenitor , the explosion or the bright afterglow .",
    "this is particularly encouraging for the use of grbs as probes of star - forming regions at high redshift ."
