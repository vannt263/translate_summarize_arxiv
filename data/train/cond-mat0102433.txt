    "many experimental and theoretical work @xcite-@xcite have focused on noble metal systems in order to get a better understanding of the role played by localized @xmath2 electrons on the properties of delocalized , free - electron - like , electrons .    the behavior of noble metals has been considered by ehrenreich and philipp @xcite .",
    "these authors used the data obtained in experimental measurements of the reflectivity from cu and ag @xcite to obtain the optical spectra .",
    "they separated the drude and interband contributions to the optical response , explaining why the energy of the plasma resonance in ag is shifted down in energy . in a later work ,",
    "cooper , ehrenreich and philipp @xcite extended this analysis to au .",
    "gold and copper present no decoupling between @xmath3 and @xmath2 orbitals , and a combined description of these one - electron states is needed to address both structural and electronic properties of these materials",
    ".    due to the rapid progress in computing technology , realistic calculations of the density - response function of solids have become feasible in the past few years .",
    "recently , the dielectric matrix as well as the energy - loss spectrum have been evaluated numerically within a first principles framework for several simple ( al @xcite , cs @xcite , be @xcite ) and noble @xcite-@xcite metals , as well as for some insulators like si @xcite , lif @xcite or al@xmath4o@xmath5 @xcite . in the case of noble metals ,",
    "the energy - loss function for cu has been evaluated in ref . 4 and plasmonic excitations in ag",

    "_ ab initio _ calculations of the electronic stopping power of real solids @xcite and excited electron lifetimes @xcite have also been reported .    in this paper",
    "we report an _ ab initio _ evaluation of the dynamical response function of au as computed in the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) after an expansion of all 6@xmath6 and 5@xmath7 one - electron states in a plane wave basis .",
    "the linear density - response function @xmath8 of an interacting electronic system is defined by the equation @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the electron density induced by an external potential @xmath11 @xcite .    for periodic crystals we fourier transform @xmath12 into a matrix @xmath13 which",

    "the inverse dielectric function is connected to the density - response function by the following relation : @xmath28 + the properties of the long - wavelength limit ( @xmath29 ) of the dynamical density - response function are accessible by measurements of the optical absorption , through the imaginary part of the dielectric response function @xmath30 .    for the evaluation of the one - electron bloch states , we first expand them in a plane - wave basis , @xmath31 + with kinetic - energy cutoff of 75 ry ( @xmath32-vectors ) and then evaluate the kohn - sham equation of dft with a full description of the electron - ion interaction based on the use of a non - local , norm - conserving ionic pseudopotential @xcite .",
    "finally , we evaluate from eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) the fourier coefficients @xmath33 , and solve the matrix equation , eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , for the fourier coefficients of the interacting density - response function , which we evaluate in the rpa .",
    "we have performed calculations for the energy - loss function using 25 , 30 and 40 bands , and samplings over the bz on @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 monkhorst - pack meshes @xcite .",
    "25 bands and a @xmath35 sampling turned out to be enough to reach convergence ( see fig . [",
    "fig : conv ] ) , but 30 bands were used to guarantee good values for the highest energies under study .",
    "[ fig : epsilon ] shows our _ ab initio calculations ( solid line ) for both real and imaginary parts of the @xmath30 dielectric function of gold for a small momentum transfer of @xmath37 ( @xmath38 is the bohr radius ) together with the optical data ( @xmath39 ) of ref .",

    "_    in fig .",
    "[ fig : imeps ] the corresponding values of the so - called energy - loss function @xmath40 $ ] are displayed .",
    "our results , obtained for a small but finite momentum transfer , are in excellent agreement with the measured dielectric function , both showing a double peak structure in the energy - loss function .",
    "the solid line represents the solution when we consider the crystalline local - field effects appearing through the dependence of the diagonal elements of the interacting response matrix @xmath41 on the off - diagonal elements of the polarizability @xmath42 .",
    "the dashed - dotted line describes the behavior when this effect is not taken into account . even if the shape of both curves is quite similar , the solid line accounts better for the experimental result than the dashed - dotted line , the difference being bigger for higher energies .",
    "the small finite q - value used keeps all the features of the optical spectrum and therefore can be directly compared with the measured one .    in order to investigate the role of localized @xmath2 bands in the dynamical response of gold , fig .",
    "[ fig : imeps ] also shows ( dotted line ) the energy - loss function calculated from an _ ab initio _ pseudopotential with the 5@xmath2 shell assigned to the core .",
    "the plot shows that a combined description of both localized 5@xmath2 bands and delocalized 6@xmath43 electrons is needed to correctly address the actual electronic response of gold .    for au , as well as for the other noble metals ,",
    "one expects to observe a resonance near 9 ev corresponding to the density of free electrons .",
    "the role of the au @xmath2 bands is to provide a polarizable background which lowers this free electron plasma frequency .",
    "we note from fig .",
    "[ fig : epsilon ] that near 5 ev the real part of the dielectric function ( @xmath44 ) is zero ; however , the imaginary part ( @xmath45 ) is not small , due to the existence of interband transitions at these energies which damp the free - electron plasmon .",
    "@xmath2-bands are also responsible , at higher energies , for a double peak structure in the energy - loss function , which arises from a combination of band - structure effects and the building up of @xmath2-like collective modes . since these peaks occur at energies ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) where @xmath44 is nearly zero ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : epsilon ] ) they are in the nature of collective excitations , the small but finite value of @xmath45 at these energies accounting for the width of the peaks .",
    "a similar double - peak structure has been obtained for the other noble metals and seems to be a general feature stemming from the particular @xmath2-electron band structure ( localization and hybridization with the delocalized @xmath48-electrons ) of the three noble metals .    in order to see the dependence of the energy - loss function on the momentum transfer @xmath49",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : q - epsilon ] the rpa dynamic structure factor for @xmath50 , as obtained for various values of @xmath51 along the ( 100 ) direction .",
    "as long as the @xmath52 shell of au is assigned to the core , one finds a well - defined free - electron plasmon for wave vectors up to the critical momentum transfer where the plasmon excitation enters the continuum of intraband particle - hole excitations .",
    "this free - electron plasmon , which is known to show a characteristic positive dispersion with wave vector , is found to be completely damped when a realistic description of @xmath52 orbitals is included in the calculations . at higher energies and small momenta ( q @xmath53 0.7 ) , @xmath2-like collective excitations originate a double - peak structure which presents no dispersion . for larger values of the momentum transfer @xmath49 ,",
    "single - particle excitations take over the collective ones up to the point that above a given cutoff , the spectra is completely dominated by the kinetic - energy term as expected .",
    "we have presented _ ab initio _ pseudopotential calculations of the dynamical density - response function of au , by including @xmath2-electrons as part of the valence complex . in the long - wavelength limit ( @xmath29 )",
    ", @xmath2-bands provide a polarizable background that lowers the free - electron plasma frequency .",
    "@xmath2-electrons are also responsible for a full damping of this @xmath48-like collective excitation and for the appearance of a @xmath2-like double - peak structure in the energy - loss function , in agreement with the experimentally determined optical response of gold . we have analyzed the dependence of the dynamical structure factor on the momentum transfer , and we have found that , for values of the momentum transfer over a given cutoff , a less - pronounced double - hump is originated by the existence of interband electron - hole excitations . the dynamical response function in cu and au shows very similar features , although in au the peaks appear for higher energies . + we acknowledge partial support by the basque hezkuntza , unibertsitate eta ikerketa saila .",
