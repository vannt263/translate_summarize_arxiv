    "the role that cp violation plays in elementary particle physics and how it relates to current theory , still remains after many years unclear . in the standard model ( sm ) ,",
    "cp violation is accommodated by inserting a single phase into the ckm matrix , and there are now under way a number of experiments to test the validity of this idea  @xcite . in supersymmetry ,",
    "the ckm phase can also exist , but it is possible to have additional phases appearing in the soft breaking masses . from the viewpoint of string theory ,",
    "cp violating phases are a natural occurrence . thus in 10 or 11 dimensional m - theory models with six dimensions compactified on a calabi - yau manifold , the kahler potential and yukawa matrices are represented by integrals over the calabi - yau space , and since this is a complex manifold , it is not surprising that cp violating phases can arise . with supersymmetry breaking",
    ", phases could arise also in the soft breaking masses .",
    "however , m - theory is not sufficiently developed to determine the details of such effects , and it is useful to have phenomenological constraints as a guide to where the fundamental theory may be .    as is well known , the existance of cp violating phases in the susy soft breaking masses leads to electric dipole moments ( edms ) for the electron and neutron , and the smallness of the current experimental bounds on these puts severe constraints on the parameter space .",
    "one may satisfy these constraints by assuming that the phases are non - zero but small ( i.e. @xmath12 ) or that the susy masses are large ( i.e. @xmath13 ) .",
    "the electron edm ( eedm ) arises from two diagrams , one involving the chargino - sneutrino intermediate state , and one involving the neutralino- selectron intermediate state .",
    "more recently it was suggested that a cancellation might occur between these two for relatively large phases ( i.e. @xmath14 ) over a reasonably large range of parameters  @xcite , and there has been a large number of analyses based on this idea  @xcite .",
    "diagrams similar to the above also enter into the muon @xmath15 , and the recently reported 2.6 @xmath16 deviation from the standard model value for that quantity  @xcite has placed significant bounds ( at the @xmath17 c.l . ) on the allowed sugra parameter space  @xcite .",
    "it is thus natural to ask whether both constraints can be phenomenologically realized , and initial discussions of this have been made  @xcite .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) has over 40 independent phases , and so can not make significant theoretical predictions on this question .",
    "we use here instead supergravity ( sugra ) gut models with gravity mediated supersymmetry breaking  @xcite and r - parity invariance   when no susy cp phases are present  @xcite , while the latter does not appear to have a satisfactory dark matter candidate  @xcite . ] .",
    "such models have become quite predictive , in part due to the fact that they automatically include the lep results on grand unification , and because radiative breaking of @xmath18 implies that the susy soft breaking masses are of electroweak size .",
    "thus the general size of both @xmath19 and the edms ( which depend on the size of the susy masses ) are restricted .",
    "in addition , such models have a natural candidate for dark matter , the lightest neutralino ( @xmath20 ) , and the condition that the relic density of neutralinos be in accord with the allowed range from astronomical measurements also puts important constraints on the parameter space .",
    "previous analyses of the edms within the framework of sugra gut models has shown that a new fine tuning problem arises at the gut scale for @xmath21 ( the phase of b , the bilinear soft breaking mass ) when @xmath22 gets large  @xcite .",
    "further , the discussion of the muon @xmath19 have shown that @xmath22 is greater than 5 ( and very possibly greater than 10 ) . in carrying out our analysis ,",
    "then , we put a constraint on the parameter space that @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the allowed range that will satisfy the experimental bounds on the edms . in order to carry out a complete analysis ,",
    "however , it is necessary to include all the accelerator constraints ( i. e. that @xmath10 gev ( where @xmath25 is the light higgs boson ) , the cleo bound on the @xmath26 decay , etc . ) as well as the full analysis of the relic density including all the stau - neutralino co - annihilation channels .",
    "( the details of these were discussed in  @xcite . )",
    "both the electron edm and the muon @xmath19 can be calculated from two types of diagrams , one with the intermediate chargino and sneutrinos states , and one with the intermediate neutralino and slepton states .",
    "if one assumes universal soft breaking in the first two generations , then the eedm and the susy deviation of the muon magnetic moment from its standard model value , @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) , can both be calculated from a single amplitude for these diagrams , the former being related to the imaginary part , and the latter to the real part . in the following",
    "we will use the symbol @xmath1 to mean the deviation of the muon @xmath29 from its standard model value .",
    "as is well known , for large @xmath22 , @xmath1 is dominated by the chargino diagram  @xcite ( the neutralino diagrams being generally quite small ) , while the strong experimental constraints on the eedm require a near cancellation between the neutralino and chargino diagrams  @xcite . in order to see how this can come about when cp",
    "violating phases are present , we calculate in the appendix the leading large @xmath30 terms .",
    "we discuss analytically in sec . 2 how both experimental constraints can naturally be satisfied at the electroweak scale .",
    "3 we examine in detail numerically the combined experimental constraints of the eedm and the brookhaven e821 @xmath1 experiment on the susy parameter space for a variant of the msugra model where the magnitudes of the soft breaking masses are universal at @xmath31 but the phases are arbitrary . the experimental lower bound on @xmath1 puts an upper bound on the gaugino mass @xmath5 , and this upper bound is generally reduced when cp violating phases are present .",
    "the higgs mass lower bound and the @xmath32 constraint generally put a lower bound on @xmath5 . imposing the fine tuning constraint at @xmath33 generally increases that bound when cp violating phases are present and also limits the range of the cp violating phases .",
    "thus the two experiments interact to further restrict the susy parameter space when cp violating phases are large . in sec .",
    "4 we give some concluding remarks .",
    "we consider here supergravity models which are a generalization of msugra to include the possibility of phases in the soft breaking masses at the gut scale @xmath34 gev .",
    "the magnitude of the soft breaking masses are still assumed to be universal , but phases are not necessarily universal .",
    "thus the susy parameters at @xmath31 are @xmath35 ( the scalar soft breaking mass ) , @xmath36 i = 1,2,3 ( the gaugino masses for the @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 groups ) , @xmath40 ( cubic soft breaking mass ) , @xmath41 ( quadratic soft breaking mass ) , and @xmath42 .",
    "the renormalization group equations ( rges ) allow one to evaluate the parameters at the electroweak scale . to one loop order , the @xmath43 and @xmath44 do not run .",
    "further , radiative breaking of @xmath18 at the electroweak scale allows one to eliminate @xmath44 in terms of @xmath45 , the @xmath3 phase at the electroweak scale , and determine @xmath46 and @xmath47 in terms of the other parameters and @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the quark and lepton phase of @xmath50 and @xmath51 at the electroweak scale , @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 are the higgs running masses at the electroweak scale .",
    "@xmath56 where @xmath57 is the one loop contribution to the higgs potential , and @xmath58 .",
    "there remain therefore four real parameters which we take to be @xmath35 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath22 , and four phases @xmath21 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 . in this paper",
    "we examine only the electron electric dipole momenthg edm  @xcite , there remain still significant hadronic uncertainties , in contrast to the clear calculation of the eedm .",
    "further , the @xmath63 phase can always be adjusted to satisfy the neutron edm , and the effect of the @xmath64hg edm would then only result in reducing the remaining parameter space that we find from the eedm and the muon @xmath19 given here . ] ( eedm ) , and so our results are only very weakly dependent on @xmath63 . also , since we are dealing only with first and second generation sleptons , there is only a weak dependence on @xmath61 .",
    "thus the two important phases are @xmath21 and @xmath62 .",

    "further , for most of the parameter space , while the range of the allowed phases at the electroweak scale required to accommodate the bound on @xmath0 is small , no fine tuning below @xmath8 is needed .",
    "we will see , however , a more serious fine tuning problem develops at the gut scale .",
    "we now examine what parameters are fine tuned at the gut scale to achieve the experimental edm bounds . from eq .",
    "( 1 ) , we see since the loop correction is small , that @xmath164 , and since we have seen that @xmath45 does not need excessive fine tuning , the same can be said for @xmath44 .",
    "further , since @xmath44 does not run with the rge , its value at the gut scale is the same as at the electroweak scale and hence no fine tuning is needed at @xmath31 .",
    "a similar result holds for @xmath62 , which also does not run with the rge .",
    "however , as has been previously pointed out  @xcite , matters are different for the @xmath3 phase at @xmath31 , @xmath21 , and we review briefly the discussion given there between the neutralino and chargino diagrams .",
    "in fact the discussion in  @xcite sets the phase @xmath21 to zero . ] .",
    "to see analytically what is occurring , we consider the intermediate and low @xmath22 region , where the rge can be analytically solved .",
    "one finds for @xmath3 the result  @xcite @xmath165 where @xmath166 and @xmath167 . as @xmath22 gets large , the radiative breaking condition eq .",
    "( 2 ) shows that @xmath47 gets small .",

    "( 27 ) gives @xmath168 to the lowest approximation , since @xmath47 is small , one may then neglect the lhs of eq .  (",
    "( 28 ) may then be viewed as an equation determining @xmath21 in terms of the other gut scale phases , and hence @xmath21 will in general be large if the other phases are not all small ( a result that is confirmed in @xcite by detailed calculation ) .",
    "however , the range of @xmath21 so that the experimental bound on @xmath0 is satisfied is then significantly reduced .",
    "thus for fixed values of @xmath61 and @xmath43 , eq .  ( 28 ) gives as @xmath22 gets large ( i.e. @xmath47 becomes small ) @xmath169 since we have already seen that @xmath119 is small ( though not violating the fine tuning condition ) , one may expect that @xmath24 may need to be fine tuned , particularly for low @xmath5 where the susy mass spectrum is light .",
    "this is seen explicitly in fig .",

    "thus fig .",

    "we have examined here what susy cp violating phases are possible within the framework of sugra models , when the electron electric dipole moment experimental bound is imposed on the susy parameter space . in order to analyze this , we imposed simultaneously the accelerator bounds of the higgs mass ( @xmath10 gev ) and the @xmath181 branching ratio , the relic density bound for neutralino cold dark matter and the recent 2.6 std deviation of the muon magnetic moment from the standard model prediction .",
    "the different experimental constraints interact with each other . thus the higgs mass and @xmath11 constraints put lower bounds on the gaugino mass ( @xmath182 gev ) which puts the relic density analysis mostly in the region where stau - neutralino co - annihilation occurs .",
    "this closely fixes the scalar mass @xmath35 in terms of @xmath5 ( for fixed @xmath7 and @xmath22 ) .",
    "the @xmath1 lower bound then puts an upper bound on @xmath5 . thus the parameter space becomes highly constrained .",
    "one can estimate analytically , as was done in sec .",

    "( 20 , 21 ) , and from the experimental lower bound on @xmath1 this reduces the upper bound on @xmath5 , limiting further the parameter space .    the relevant question , however , is whether the smallness of the experimental bound on @xmath0 requires an unreasonable amount of fine tuning of the phases . using the parameter @xmath185 , we find at the electroweak scale , both @xmath157 and @xmath159 are small , i. e. a few percent . however , in general @xmath158 , and so no fine tuning below the @xmath8 level is needed .",
    "however , at the gut scale , this is not the case for @xmath171 for a significant part of the parameter space . thus if we were to exclude regions where @xmath186 , then for @xmath127 , @xmath150 , @xmath62 phases near @xmath187 ( i. e. @xmath188 ) are completely excluded ( fig .  11 ) .",
    "the effect is reduced for higher @xmath22 . however , for example , for @xmath143 , @xmath150 the condition @xmath158 would eliminate @xmath189 gev for @xmath190 , and raise the lower bound on @xmath5 by a lesser amount for other values of @xmath62 ( fig .  10 ) .",
    "increasing @xmath7 decreases the value of @xmath156 , making the fine tuning more serious , as can be seen in fig .",
    "the fine tuning problem is thus on the verge of becoming quite acute .",

    "of course , what level of fine tuning one accepts is somewhat a matter of taste , and we view the criteria @xmath158 as merely a bench mark for consideration .",
    "however , the above results show that any significant experimental reduction of @xmath0 would make the idea of large susy cp violating phases more difficult to maintain , as fine tuning would set in even at the electroweak scale unless the susy masses are heavy .",
