    "recently , randall and sundrum(rs ) proposed a compactification scheme with nonvanishing cosmological constant in the bulk  @xcite which has immediately attracted a great deal of attention  @xcite .",
    "the most simple compactification studied in superstring models before the rs proposal has been the orbifold compactification  @xcite in which the compactified space is flat . on the other hand ,",
    "the randall - sundrum compactification allows a nonflat compactified space , but the analysis is relatively simple . because of the nonflat nature of the bulk between two branes , there exists an exponential warp factor for metrics going from one brane to the other  @xcite .",
    "this exponential warp factor has been suggested for a large hierarchy between the planck scale @xmath0  gev and the electroweak scale @xmath1  250  gev .    among two branes ,",
    "let brane 1 ( b1 ) the hidden - sector brane and brane 2 ( b2 ) the visible sector brane .",
    "an exponential warp factor suppresses the soft mass in the visible brane b2 , and it is possible to obtain this small ratio because the higgs mass term at b2 is a dimension two operator .",
    "thus , in the rs world , one changes the traditional gauge hierarchy problem to a problem in geometry . using the same argument ,",
    "the nonrenormalizable operators are suppressed not by @xmath2 but by @xmath3 .",
    "thus one has to make sure that the theory has a high degree of symmetry to suppress sufficiently the unwanted operators .",
    "another problem is the problem of inflation .",
    "generally , inflation occurs unless one fine - tunes the bulk cosmological constant and the brane tensions  @xcite . for the fine - tuned relations  @xcite",
    ", there exist static solutions .",
    "so far it has not been shown that any of the static solutions is the @xmath4 limit , not allowing a graceful exit from the inflationary period .",
    "in addition , there is a possibility that the separation between the branes is expanding or shrinking exponentially .",
    "however , this last problem may be understood by introducing a scalar field in the bulk  @xcite .",
    "the most interesting point of the rs world is the interplay of the bulk and the brane world .",
    "in particular , the bulk cosmological constant ( @xmath5 ) and the brane tensions ( @xmath6 ) must be related , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "but the expansion rate of the observable universe is measured by the hubble parameter which is a function of @xmath5 and @xmath9 .",
    "these @xmath5 s are the appropriately defined from the original bulk cosmological constant @xmath10 and the brane tensions @xmath11 at b1 and b2  @xcite .",
    "one interesting point of the rs compactification is that there may exists a possibility of understanding the old cosmological costant problem .    below the planck scale ,",
    "the higher order effective interaction in the rs model is known to be the gauss - bonnet interaction  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the models without the gauss - bonnet interaction , this model allows solutions with a positive @xmath12 at the visible brane , which is suitable for a proper expansion in the standard big bang cosmology after the inflationary period .    in sec .",
    "ii , the rs compactification with the gauss - bonnet term is explored . in sec .",
    "iii , the static background solutions with the gauss - bonnet interaction are presented . in sec .",
    "iv , simple inflationary solutions are given . in sec .",
    "v , we present other possible inflationary solutions . in sec .",
    "vi , metric perturbation near the static background geometry is discussed .",
    "we will neglect the matter interaction , and consider only the gravitational interaction with cosmological constants in the bulk and at the branes .",
    "the space - time dimension is @xmath13 .",
    "the fifth dimension @xmath14 is compactified with an @xmath15 orbifold .",
    "the five dimensional index is @xmath16 and the four dimensional brane world index is @xmath17 .",
    "the fifth dimension variable @xmath18 ranges in the region [ 0 , 1/2 ] .",
    "the @xmath15 orbifold is used to locate the two branes at @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the periodicity of @xmath18 is 1 .",
    "below the planck scale , the higher order gravity effects can be added as effective interaction terms . since we are neglecting the matter interactions , the possible terms in the lagrangian",
    "is , up to o(@xmath21 ) @xmath22 where @xmath23 are the determinants of the metrics in the bulk and the branes , @xmath24 is the five dimensional gravitational constant , @xmath10 and @xmath25 are the bulk and brane cosmological constants , and @xmath26 are the effective couplings .",
    "we assume that the three dimensional space is homogeneous and isotropic , and hence the metric is parametrized by @xmath27 , and @xmath28 @xmath29 where the roman characters @xmath30 denote the space indices 1 , 2 , and 3 .",
    "it has been found that there exist solutions consistent with the randall - sundrum setup if the additional interaction is of the gauss - bonnet type  @xcite , namely @xmath31 and @xmath32 are satisfied . in this case",
    ", the higher @xmath18 derivative terms , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath18 . ]",
    "are absent in the left - hand side of the einstein equation .",
    "these conditions for vanishing higher @xmath18 derivative terms are necessary since the right - hand side of the einstein equation contains only one power of the dirac delta function and the higher derivative terms diverge more rapidly than the delta function at the branes .",
    "we find that this result is highly nontrivial .",
    "however , it can be anticipated from the fact that the gauss - bonnet term can be rewritten as a pseudoscalar quantity , @xmath39 .",
    "> from the antisymmetric property of the riemann tensor , we observe that there are no @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 terms are absent in the action .",
    "we can see it from the antisymmetric property of the riemann tensor , @xmath43 and unique non - vanishing christoffel symbol containing the first derivative of @xmath28 with respect to @xmath18 is @xmath44 . ] in the action which would have given the unwanted fourth order derivatives in the equations of motion .",
    "thus , the gauss - bonnet effective interaction does not contain higher @xmath18 derivatives .",
    "the gauss - bonnet term @xmath45 is a total derivative in @xmath46 spacetime , in which case it does not change the einstein gravity . on the other hand , for @xmath47",
    "it is not a topological quantity any more .",
    "still , it does not contribute to the massive poles of the spin-2 propagator  @xcite .",
    "it means that the metric variations near the flat space do not give rise to a ghost graviton even with the gauss - bonnet term . in general , a combination of the quadratic curvature terms without the gauss - bonnet ratio leads to ghosts .",
    "but it may not be meaningful if the location of the ghost pole in the graviton propagator is above the planck scale where the derivative expansion breaks down .",
    "however , the gauss - bonnet term possibly excites ghost particles near anti - de sitter space in the sense that the sign of the propagator can be flipped  @xcite .",
    "the general curvature squared terms in any space - time dimension @xmath48 can be rewritten as  @xcite , @xmath49 @xmath50e + \\bigg(\\frac{d-2}{d-3}\\bigg)(\\beta /4+\\gamma)c^2",

    "then the coefficient of the resultant gauss - bonnet term becomes @xmath56 .",
    "for @xmath57 and @xmath54 , there still exist higher time derivatives @xmath58 in the action from the curvature squared terms .",
