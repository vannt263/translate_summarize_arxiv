    "the theory of nuclear forces has a long history . based upon the yukawa idea  @xcite and the discovery of the pion , the 1950 s became the first period of `` pion theories '' . these , however , resulted in failure  for reasons we understand today : pion dynamics is ruled by chiral symmetry , a constraint that was not realized in the theories of the 1950 s .",
    "the 1960 s and 70 s represent the main period for theories that also include heavy mesons ( `` meson theories '' )  @xcite , but the work on meson models continued all the way into the 1990 s when the family of the so - called high - precision nn potentials was developed .",
    "this family includes the nijm - i , nijm - ii , and reid93 potentials  @xcite , the argonne @xmath0  @xcite , and the cd - bonn potential  @xcite .",
    "later , also the highly non - local potential by doleschall _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and the `` cd - bonn + @xmath1 '' model by deltuva _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite joined the club .",
    "all these potentials have in common that they are charge - dependent , use about 40 - 50 parameters , and reproduce the 1992 nijmegen nn data base with a @xmath2/datum @xmath3 .    over the past ten years",
    ", the high - precision potentials have been applied intensively in exact few - body calculations and miscroscopic nuclear structure theory .",
    "already the first few applications of the high - precision potentials in three - nucleon reactions  @xcite clearly revealed sizable differences between the predictions from nn potentials with a @xmath2/datum @xmath3 ( i.e. , the new generation of potentials ) and nn potentials with a @xmath2/datum @xmath4 ( the old generation of the 1970 s and 80 s which includes the old nijmegen , the paris , and the old bonn potentials ) .",
    "thus , once for all , the standard of precision was established that must be met by any future work in microscopic nuclear structure and exact few - body calculations : the input nn potential must reproduce the nn data with a @xmath2/datum @xmath3 or the uncertainty in the predictions will make it impossible to draw reliable conclusions .    in spite of these great practical achievements",
    ", the high - precision potentials can not be the end of the story , because they are all phenomenological in nature .",
    "ultimately , we need potentials that are based on proper theory _ and _ yield quantitative results .    since the nuclear force is a manifestation of strong interactions , any serious derivation has to start from quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "however , the well - known problem with qcd is that it is non - perturbative in the low - energy regime characteristic for nuclear physics . for many years",
    ", this fact was perceived as a major obstacle for a derivation of the nuclear force from qcd ",
    "impossible to overcome except by lattice qcd .",
    "the effective field theory ( eft ) concept has shown the way out of this dilemma .",
    "one has to realize that the scenario of low - energy qcd is characterized by pions and nucleons interacting via a force governed by spontaneously broken approximate chiral symmetry .",
    "based upon this eft , a systematic expansion in terms of @xmath5 can be developed , where @xmath6 denotes a momentum or pion mass , @xmath7 gev is the chiral symmetry breaking scale , and @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "this has become known as chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) . in contrast to the pion theories of the 1950 s , this new chirally constrained `` pion theory '' is quite successful . starting with the pioneering work by ordez , ray , and van kolck in the early 1990 s  @xcite ,",
    "nn potentials have been constructed in the framework of chpt . in the next section ,",
    "i will discuss the latest status of this work .",
    "a remarkable fact of chpt is that it makes specific predictions also for many - body forces . for a given order of chpt , two - nucleon forces ( 2nf ) , three - nucleon forces ( 3nf ) , ",
    "are generated on the same footing ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a concise review ) . at leading order ( lo )",
    ", there are no 3nf , and at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , all 3nf terms cancel  @xcite",
    ". however , at next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) and higher orders , well - defined , nonvanishing 3nf occur  @xcite . since 3nf",
    "show up for the first time at nnlo , they are weak .",
    "four - nucleon forces ( 4nf ) occur first at n@xmath9lo and are , therefore , even weaker .",
    ".@xmath2/datum for the reproduction of the 1999 @xmath10 database by families of @xmath10 potentials at nlo and nnlo constructed by the bochum / juelich group  @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the two - pion - exchange contribution to the nn interaction depends on the low - energy constants ( lecs ) of the dimension - two lagrangian , commonly denoted by @xmath11 , and the dimension - three lecs , @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "these parameters have been determined in @xmath13 data analyses , see column @xmath13 of table 4 .",
    "the most influential lec is @xmath14 and , so , we will focus here just on @xmath14 . not surprisingly , the idaho and bochum / juelich n@xmath9lo potentials apply essentially the same value , namely , @xmath15 gev@xmath16 , which is on the lower side but still roughly within one standard deviation of its @xmath13 determination .",
    "there exists also a determination of this parameter from the nn data by the nijmegen group .",
    "they report @xmath17 gev@xmath16 in their 1999 @xmath18 analysis  @xcite and @xmath19 gev@xmath16 in their 2003 @xmath20 analysis  @xcite . knowing the sensitivity of nn phase shifts and observables to @xmath14 , the difference between the nn potential values of about 3.3 gev@xmath16 and the nijmegen nn analysis value of 4.8 gev@xmath16 is _",
    "huge_. off - hand , it is hard to understand how two different types of nn analyses can be in such severe disagreement .",
    "however , the discrepancy is easily explained if one looks into the details of the nijmegen analysis  @xcite .",
    "the nijmegen group starts from the nn amplitude at nnlo in momentum space , fourier transforms it into @xmath21-space to obtain a local potential , and then cuts this potential off at r=1.6 fm ( i.e. , the potential is set to zero for @xmath22 fm ) .",
    "the impact of this cutoff is demonstrated in figure  2 for the @xmath23 phase shifts , which is a representative case . in that figure ,",
    "the solid line shows the phase shifts derived from the nn amplitude at nnlo using @xmath24 gev@xmath16 and applying no cutoffs ( i.e. , the actual model - independent amplitude at nnlo is used ) .",
    "the dashed line is obtained when the nijmegen cutoff is applied and , as before , @xmath24 gev@xmath16 is used .",
    "the difference between the two curves in fig .",
    "2 is entirely due to the cutoff applied in the nijmegen analysis .",
    "it is clearly seen that the influence of this cutoff is dramatic and introduces a huge systematic error rendering the nimegen analysis and their results unreliable  @xcite .",
    "it must be noted that the idaho and bochum / juelich n@xmath9lo potentials also use cutoffs , but not as harsh ones as in the nijmegen analysis .",
    "the best way to determine the lecs from nn data is to apply no cutoffs to the nn amplitudes ( at nnlo or n@xmath9lo ) in peripheral partial waves and to keep the amplitudes of lower partial waves at their empirical values ( as determined in phase shift analysis ) . in such an analysis",
    "the value @xmath25 gev@xmath16 is obtained  @xcite .",
    "the theory of nuclear forces has made great progress since the turn of the millennium .",
    "nucleon - nucleon potentials have been developed that are based on proper theory ( eft for low - energy qcd ) and are of high - precision , at the same time . moreover , the theory generates two- and many - body forces on an equal footing and provides a theoretical explanation for the empirically known fact that 2nf @xmath26 3nf @xmath26 4nf  .    at n@xmath9lo  @xcite",
    ", the accuracy can be achieved that is necessary and sufficient for microscopic nuclear structure .",
    "first calculations applying the n@xmath9lo nn potential  @xcite in the ( no - core ) shell model @xcite , the coupled cluster formalism @xcite , and the unitary - model - operator approach  @xcite have produced promising results .",
    "the 3nf at nnlo is known  @xcite and has been applied in few - nucleon reactions  @xcite as well as the structure of light nuclei  @xcite .",
    "however , the famous ` @xmath27 puzzle ' of nucleon - deuteron scattering is not resolved by the 3nf at nnlo .",
    "thus , the most important outstanding issue is the 3nf at n@xmath9lo , which is under construction  @xcite .",
    "another open question that needs to be settled is whether weinberg power counting , which is applied in all current nn potentials , is consistent .",
    "this controversial issue is presently being debated in the literature  @xcite .",
    "it may be too early to claim that the never - ending - story is coming to an end , but the story seems to be converging  at the same rate as chiral perturbation theory .",
