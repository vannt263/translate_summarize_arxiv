    "the origin of unconventional superconductivity in ferropnictide compounds , their phase diagram and symmetry of the underlying order parameter are topics that attract considerable interest in recent years , see refs .   for reviews .",
    "superconductivity in pnictides emerges in close proximity to an antiferromagnetically ordered state , and the critical temperature @xmath4 has a dome - shaped dependence on doping  @xcite similar to that in cuprates . due to their multiband electronic structure with multiple fermi surfaces and delicate interplay of interactions in different channels a number of possibilities for electron ordering",
    "are possible .",
    "@xcite structural transition , competing or coexisting magnetic spin - density - wave ( sdw ) and superconducting ( sc ) orders are being examples",
    ". the latter may be in the form of the conventional @xmath1-wave state that has @xmath5-wave symmetry in the brillouin zone and gaps of the same sign on electron and holes fermi surfaces .",
    "alternatively , sc order may appear in the form of an extended @xmath0 state that looks as @xmath5-wave from a symmetry point of view but has opposite signs of the gaps on different sheets of the fermi surfaces .",
    "@xcite there may be scenarios of several sc states with the nodes in the sc gap , of both @xmath5-wave and @xmath6-wave symmetries .",
    "@xcite    experimentally , the most convincing support in favor of unconventional symmetry of pnictides is given so far by the observed spin resonance below @xmath4 in inelastic neutron scattering measurements on k - doped bafeas .",
    "@xcite in all the materials studied , the resonance occurs at the antiferromagnetic wave vector @xmath7 of the parent compound .",
    "it is thought to be a triplet excitation of the singlet cooper pairs , implying a superconducting order parameter that satisfies @xmath8 , which indicates either @xmath0 or @xmath6-wave cases . fabricated @xmath9-axis josephson junctions of this material and ordinary superconductor are suggestive of an @xmath5-wave state , but not providing unambiguous evidence for the @xmath0 state itself .",
    "@xcite in addition , @xmath10-corner - junction experiments with co - doped bafeas seems to eliminate the option of @xmath6-wave pairing .",
    "@xcite other notable experiments providing substantial but still indirect support of @xmath0 state include quasiparticle interference in magnetic field probed by scanning tunneling microscopy  @xcite and observation of half - integer flux - quantum jumps through the loop formed by niobium and polycrystalline iron - pnictide sample .",
    "@xcite finally , there is a growing number of low - temperatures studies addressing thermodynamics and transport properties of pnictides , however it is usually hard to deduce underlying symmetry of a superconductor from such data . for fully gapped @xmath5-wave state , one expects to see exponentially suppressed quasiparticle response and power - law in temperature for the @xmath6-wave state with the nodes .",
    "the possible ambiguity in interpretation of data stems from the fact that accidental nodes on the fermi surface or impurity - induced subgap states may easily alter low - temperature behavior of , for example , heat capacity or london penetration depth .",
    "it is widely agreed that a decisive experiment should involve a phase sensitive probe such as the josephson effect .",
    "although original proposals  @xcite followed mostly immediately after the @xmath0 candidate symmetry was introduced , no such direct measurements of the current - phase relationship have been performed so far for pnictide - based josephson junctions .",
    "nevertheless , this inspired a lot of theoretical efforts in finding simpler geometries or alternative signatures of @xmath0 pairing state in proximity circuits with pnictides and conventional superconductors .",
    "@xcite a particularly interesting recent conclusion  @xcite is that tunneling spectra of weakly coupled @xmath5-@xmath0 bi - layers exhibit distinct features characteristic only to sign - changing symmetry of the gap .",
    "physically , the effect comes from the frustration in the junction since the gap of an ordinary superconductor tends to align with one of the gaps of @xmath0 superconductor , and thus becomes in the conflict with the other band experiencing the anti - proximity effect .",
    "in this work , we consider plethora of effects in superconductor - metal - superconductor junctions where one or both superconductors are assumed to have @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the metal is either normal or ferromagnetic diffusive wire . in the context of the josephson effect , in such structures , we find various current - phase relationships whose shapes depend on the relation between the wire length and superconducting coherence length , and boundary transparency .",
    "the generic feature is non - analytical behavior of the current near phase @xmath3 , which corresponds to the closing of the proximity - induced gap in the wire , and robust @xmath2-@xmath3 oscillations even without ferromagnets . in the context of the proximity - induced density of states ( dos ) in the wire , we identify fingerprints of the @xmath0 symmetry , which is thus not only unique to frustrated @xmath5-@xmath0 bi - layers .",
    "we build our calculations based on the usadel equations  @xcite and accompanying kupriyanov - lukichev boundary conditions  @xcite modified for a multiband case .",

    "we also used notations @xmath28 and similar for @xmath29 , and introduced green s functions of a superconductor in the bulk : @xmath30 and @xmath31 , with @xmath32 being corresponding gaps .",

    "however @xmath66 calculation of the josephson current simplifies considerably . in this case",
