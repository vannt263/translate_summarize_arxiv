    "a bidirectional or two - way relaying scenario consists of nodes a and b wanting to exchange data using a relay r. if the relay performs plnc , the relaying has two phases : multiple access ( ma ) phase and broadcast ( bc ) phase @xcite . in the ma phase , users transmit signals simultaneously to the relay .",
    "the signal received at the relay is a noisy sum of transmitted signals scaled by their respective channel coefficients .",
    "the relay applies a many - to - one map on the received symbol , such that the users can decode the desired message , given their own message and a knowledge of the map .",
    "the salient feature of this scheme is that the mapping depends on the _ fade state _ of user - relay channels .",
    "hence , the complex plane representing the ratio of channel coefficients ( or fade state ) has to be partitioned to indicate which map is to be used in a given region .",
    "relaying carried out in this manner is highly efficient compared to conventional relaying and network coding at bit - level . @xcite .",
    "both users are assumed to apply the same constellation during the ma phase @xcite .",
    "however , due to varying channel conditions ( i.e. average snr ) , each link may only be able to support constellations up to a certain cardinality .",
    "such a scheme is known as heterogeneous plnc ( hepnc ) which was proposed by zhang et al .",
    "three cases of hepnc viz .",
    "qpsk - bpsk , 8psk - bpsk , and 16qam - bpsk are investigated in @xcite and the network coding maps are obtained using cnc algorithm @xcite . however , a computationally efficient way of obtaining the network coding maps and the corresponding fade state region boundaries using the concept of _ singular fade states _ ( sfs ) , is known @xcite for _ symmetric _ psk modulations .",
    "also , the concept of _ clustering independent _ regions is not considered in @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we provide an analytical approach to the plnc scheme with heterogeneous psk modulations by extending the framework of muralidharan et al.@xcite .",
    "the contributions of this paper are :    * the analytical framework provided in this paper enables the investigation of two - way relaying using hepnc with psk modulations .",
    "this includes cases like 8psk - qpsk plnc which are not considered by zhang et al . *",
    "the approach taken by zhang et al . uses a computer search based cnc algorithm @xcite to find the boundaries of _ relay - mapping regions_. the complexity increases with the order of psk signal sets used .",
    "this work provides explicit equations for the boundaries of _ relay - mapping",
    "_ regions . * for the hepnc modulations dealt by zhang et al , where one of the users employs bpsk signal set , the boundaries of relay - mapping consist of straight lines only . for a general case",
    ", the boundaries also include arcs of circles , for which this paper gives explicit equations . *",
    "this work generalizes some results of @xcite .",
    "for example , if same order of psk modulation is used at both users , the _ internal _ clustering independent ( ci ) region is obtained from complex inversion of _ external _ ci region .",
    "this paper provides equations to obtain boundaries of internal ci regions for heterogeneous psk modulations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section ii describes the system model , which is followed by the derivation of the exact number and location of sfs in section iii .",
    "the latin rectangles used for qpsk - bpsk and 8psk - bpsk schemes , which serve as many - to - one maps at the relay are listed in section iv . the analytical framework for partitioning of the fade state plane",
    "is given in section v. thereafter , the performance is evaluated in terms of bit and relay error rates in awgn and rayleigh fading channels .",
    "the results match those provided by zhang et al .",
    "the hepnc system comprises of two users a and b , wanting to exchange data through a relay r. the notation from @xcite and @xcite has been used and extended . let a and b use psk modulations @xmath0 of cardinality @xmath1 , where , @xmath2 for @xmath3 .",
