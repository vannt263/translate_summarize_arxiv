    "the bright x - ray sources in external galaxies , known as ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) , are of considerable current interest because they may be ` intermediate - mass ' black holes @xcite .",
    "one of the most extreme ulxs is located in the nearby starburst galaxy m82 @xcite .",
    "chandra observations showed that the brightest source in the galaxy , cxou j095550.2 + 694047 = x41.4 + 60 @xcite , is offset from the nucleus , not coincident with any radio supernova remnant , and highly variable on time scales of weeks .",
    "the offset of the source from the dynamical center of the galaxy places an upper bound on its mass of @xmath6 , depending on its age , due to dynamical friction @xcite .",
    "these observations rule out a low luminosity agn or a very luminous supernova or hypernova remnant as the source of the x - ray emission .",
    "if the radiation from x41.4 + 60 is isotropic and from an accreting object , then the mass of the accretor must be in excess of @xmath7 .",
    "combined with the mass upper bound , this would place the object firmly in the `` intermediate - mass '' black hole category .",
    "however , alternative explanations must be considered , particularly that the ulxs radiate at super - eddington luminosities @xcite or that the radiation is beamed , so the true luminosity is significantly less than calculated assuming isotropic emission . @xcite",
    "have suggested that ulxs are high - mass x - ray binaries in a short - lived phase which occurs early in the life of almost every system and during which mass is transferred from the companion to the compact object on the thermal time scale of the companion  leading to super - eddington accretion rates .",
    "the x - ray emission in this phase is mechanically beamed , producing high observed x - ray fluxes for observers near the beaming axis . however , the flux of x41.4 + 60 is so high that producing it via mechanical beaming of a stellar - mass black hole is problematic . @xcite",
    "specifically point to x41.4 + 60 as an example of a system where their model may not apply .",
    "@xcite pointed out that radio microquasars with their axes aimed at us ( `` microblazars '' ) should occur in nearby galaxies . @xcite",
    "have suggested that the ulxs may be stellar - mass black holes in which a relativistic jet produces most of the observed x - ray flux .",
    "jets aligned nearly along our line of sight could then produce high apparent x - ray fluxes via relativistic beaming .",
    "if the ulxs are microblazars , then they should be radio sources and the x - ray and radio emission of the ulxs should be well correlated and highly variable on time scales as short as days .",
    "@xcite noted that an unusual radio transient , 41.5 + 59.7 @xcite , lies within the error box for x41.4 + 60 .",
    "this transient was detected in february 1981 at a 5 ghz flux of 7  mjy and not detected with an upper limit of 1.5  mjy in october 1983 .",
    "the sharp decrease in flux indicates that it is not a supernova remnant .",
    "transient radio emission from an accreting compact object would suggest the presence of a jet of relativistic particles @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite found quasiperiodic oscillations ( qpos ) in the range 50110  mhz which they identify as arising from x41.4 + 60 .",
    "if the qpo frequency is limited by the orbital frequency around a non - rotating black hole , then it would imply a mass limit of @xmath8 .",
    "the qpos were discovered in xmm - newton data and confirmed in rxte data .",
    "the qpos are only occasionally detected in the rxte data and there is no apparent correlation between qpo detections and the source flux level .",
    "based on a comparison with the spectral and timing properties of stellar - mass black hole x - ray binaries , @xcite estimate a mass of the order of 1000@xmath9 for the compact object producing the qpos .",
    "the qpos were confirmed in a longer xmm - newton observation , but found at a somewhat higher frequency of 113  mhz @xcite .",
    "the position of x41.4 + 60 is within @xmath10 of the position of the infrared source and super star cluster mgg 11 @xcite .",
    "simulations of the dynamical evolution of the cluster mgg 11 show that stellar collisions in its extremely dense core may have led to numerous stellar collisions and the formation of an intermediate mass black hole @xcite .    in order to obtain more information about x41.4 + 60",
    ", we monitored m82 for 240  days using the proportional counter array ( pca ) on the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) with observations obtained typically every 2 days .",
    "the pca is not an imaging instrument , but is adequate to measure the x - ray flux and rapid variability of the integrated output of the entire galaxy .",
    "we discovered an x - ray periodicity from m82 at @xmath0 days which we have previously reported @xcite .",
    "additional details of the analysis are presented here .",
    "we also found a transient event where the x - ray flux of the galaxy increased by a factor of three over the quiescent level over a period of a few days .",
    "after the onset of this remarkable x - ray flare , we obtained imaging x - ray observations with the chandra x - ray observatory and radio observations with the very large array ( vla ) .",
    "we describe x - ray observations with rxte and chandra in   2 , the vla data in   3 , and discuss the results in   4 .",
    "we obtained a total of 141 observations of m82 with a total effective exposure of 281.2  ks using the proportional counter array ( pca ) on the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) under program 90121 ( pi kaaret ) .",
    "two of the observations were made early to test our procedures for the acquisition and analysis of realtime data .",
    "the bulk of the observations consisted of monitoring the galaxy typically every second day during the period over which the vla was in the a , bna , or b configuration during 2004 and 2005 and covered dates from mjd 53252 to 53490 .    to enable target of opportunity observations with chandra and the vla , we analyzed the real time data from rxte soon after the data became available on the rxte ftp site .",
    "the analysis was carried out with the ftools package ( version 5.3.1 ) which is part of the heasoft software .",
    "after the data were retrieved , they were filtered to select good time intervals such that proportional counter unit ( pcu ) 2 was on , the source was more than ten degrees above the horizon , the pointing offset from the source was less than @xmath11 , the satellite was out of the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) , and the electron contamination was less than 0.1 .",
    "a background file was made for the same interval as the observation with the model pca_bkgd_cmfaintl7_emv20031123.mdl and the newest predicted saa passage file downloaded at the same time as the data .",
    "the ftool saextrct was used to make both light curves and spectra for the observation and the background , using only data from pcu 2 .",
    "the spectra were fitted with a power - law model using the spectral fitting program xspec , which is part of heasoft , to obtain a measurement of the flux in the 210  kev band .",
    "our flux monitoring led to the detection of an x - ray flare reaching a flux of @xmath12 in the 210  kev band on 26 jan 2005 ( mjd 53396.4 ) . on the basis of this flare detection , we triggered target of opportunity observations with chandra and the vla .",

    "to produce an energy spectrum for each observation , we used the rex script .",
    "we produced spectra using only the top layer in pcu 2 , including channels 2 - 44 which cover the energy range 2 - 20  kev .",
    "response matrices were made for each observation .",
    "the expected background was estimated using the same model mentioned above and a systematic uncertainty was included in the background estimate .",

    "removing the two early observations does not significantly affect the periodogram .",
    "the peak is then at @xmath18 days with a power of 27.5 .",
    "removing the observations during the x - ray flare near mjd 53400 does not shift the peak , but increases its power . with the points with fluxes above @xmath19",

    "accreting compact objects often exhibit red noise , or increasing timing noise at decreasing frequency with a power - law dependence of power on frequency .",
    "red noise can produce apparent periodicities at periods comparable to the observation duration @xcite .",
    "we tested the significance of the observed signal using a red noise background .",
    "first , we fit a power - law to the power versus frequency relation for periods shorter than 40 days @xcite .",
    "we found a spectral index of -0.78 .",
    "we then generated red noise with this spectral index and with a mean and variance equal to the mean and variance of the actual data .",
    "this procedure is conservative because it includes the variance due to the signal itself and also due to the x - ray flare .",
    "we generated simulated light curves using the rndpwrlc routine of the aitlib idl subroutine library provided by the institut fr astronomie und astrophysik of the universitt tbingen .",
    "for each light curve , we generated 2048 data points with uniform spacing equal to one third of the average spacing of the main 139 observations of our monitoring program and used only 141 points from the middle of the simulated data with relative times matching the actual observations .",
    "generating a simulated light curve longer than the portion used helps eliminate the effects of red noise leakage .",
    "the simulated data were processed with the same procedures used to analyze the real data .",
    "we generated 100,000 trial light curves and searched for cases where the power at a period of 80 days or less , corresponding to three oscillation cycles in the main portion of the monitoring , was greater than or equal to the observed value of 27.9 .",
    "we found only 2 cases , equivalent to a probability of chance occurrence of our observed signal of @xmath22 .",
    "the q value of the peak , the period of the peak divided by the full width at half maximum power , in the periodogram is 4.5 , which is fully consistent with that expected for a periodic process given the observation duration , but is only weakly constraining . to attempt to determine whether or not the signal is strictly periodic , we measured the arrival times of the peak maxima .",
    "we fit the data near each peak , @xmath2320 days , with a second order polynomial .",
    "we excluded the very high flux points with fluxes above @xmath24 . comparing the peak times to an assumed 62 day period , we find that the measured arrival times of first , second , and fourth peaks are consistent with the predicted arrival time for periodic signal within 2 days .",
    "the third peak differs by 4 days .",
    "however , the polynomial fit is affected by two high flux points in the decaying part of that peak ( at mjd 53408.2 and 53412.7 ) .",
    "if we fit the data within @xmath2311 days of that peak , we find that the peak arrival time agrees within 1 day of the time predicted for a periodic signal .",
    "we note that we had observations only every second day and there are variations in the flux from other sources in m82 which are not related to the 62 day periodicity and which lead to uncertainty in the time of arrival determination . to estimate the uncertainty in the polynomial fits",
    ", we varied the width of the data windows and the placement of the data windows , i.e.  offsets the windows with respect to the peak .",
    "we conclude that the peak arrival times are accurate to about 2 days .",
    "therefore , the arrival times of the peaks are consistent with being periodic at an interval of 62.0 days . however , additional observations are essential to test the periodic nature of the signal .",
    "there is archival rxte data from a previous set of observations of m82 made in 1997 .",
    "however , the time coverage of that data set is uneven and generally less dense than in our monitoring program .",
    "there is a hint of one peak in the 1997 light curve around mjd 50585 which has a shape similar to the four seen in our data .",
    "however , the 1997 data alone is insufficient to confirm or deny the periodicity .",

    "events in the 2 - 10  kev energy band were selected and split into segments of 256  s. an fft with a time resolution of @xmath26  s was calculated for each segment .",

    "the observation was made using the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer spectroscopy array ( acis - s ; bautz et al .",

    "the high flux anticipated from the source would have caused severe pile - up if the source were placed on - axis and the standard observing mode were used .",
    "to reduce the effect of pile - up , the target was offset @xmath28 along the y - detector coordinate .",
    "this placed the target off axis where the point spread function broadens and the x - ray flux is spread over multiple pixels in the ccd detector which reduces pile - up . in addition , we operated only the s3 chip and employed a 1/8 sub - array mode to reduce the frame time to 0.441  s and further reduce the pile - up . to check if pile - up was significant in the data acquired , we calculated the count rate in the @xmath29 pixel cell at the peak of the brightest source in the image .",
    "the rate was 0.18 counts / frame , giving a pile - up fraction of 3.2% within this @xmath29 pixel cell .",
    "the counts in the peak @xmath29 pixel cell are 70% of the total source counts , so the overall pile - up fraction is 2.2% .",
    "therefore , the effect of pile - up on the timing and power spectra is small .",
    "the chandra data were subjected to standard data processing and event screening ( ascds version 7.5.0.1 using caldb version 3.0.0 ) . the total rate on the s3 chip was between 2.53.8  c / s for the entire observation and did not show any strong background flares .",

    "we found that use of the higher energy band seemed to produce more reliable point source detections and that the diffuse emission had less influence on the calculated source positions .",

    "given the astrometric uncertainty of chandra , we conclude that the source is a possible radio counterpart to x41.4 + 60 .",
    "this radio source is unresolved in all observations and has a position of ( j2000 ) : 09 55 50.33 , 69 40 46.3 .",
    "the 8.5 ghz flux density of this source is @xmath59  mjy on 1 feb 2005 and @xmath60  mjy on 3 feb 2005 .",
    "the source is not detected on 29 jan 2005 with an upper limit of @xmath61  mjy and a marginal detection of @xmath62  mjy on 5 feb 2005 .",
    "@xcite report the only other detection of a radio source at this position , 41.62 + 59.9 ( j1950 coordinates name ) , with a flux density of @xmath63  mjy at 8.5  ghz .",
    "the source is @xmath64 from the radio transient reported by @xcite .",
    "radio emission is also detected from a source which falls within the @xmath58  error radius of x42.3 + 59 .",
    "this radio source , known as 42.21 + 59.0 , has been detected previously by a number of radio studies of compact sources in m82 .",
    "we measure the flux density of 42.21 + 59.0 to be @xmath65  mjy during the first three observations and @xmath66  mjy on 5 feb 2005 .",
    "values for the 8.5  ghz flux density of this source range from 1.9  mjy @xcite to 6.7  mjy @xcite .",
    "the range of values is most likely due to the differing interferometric arrays used for observation ( which are sensitive to different spatial scales of radio emission ) and the different techniques used to account for the extended background emission surrounding the source . based on its flat or slightly positive spectrum ( between 5 and 15  ghz ) , extended size ,",
    "the presence of oh and water masers and radio recombination line emission , 42.21 + 59.0 is believed to be a giant hii region containing as many as 94 o5-type stars @xcite .",
    "the fluxes measured by rxte for the observations before and after the chandra observation are consistent with @xmath67 in the 210  kev band .",
    "the total flux in the entire chandra image is @xmath68 in the 210  kev band , which is consistent within the errors on the flux estimate and the relative calibration uncertainty between rxte and chandra . of the total chandra flux in this band ,",
    "50% arises from x41.4 + 60 and 23% arises from x42.3 + 59 .",
    "the peak flux measured by rxte during the flare was @xmath69 on mjd 53400.2 . assuming that a flux of @xmath70 arises from the remainder of the galaxy , the flux of the point source producing the flare would be @xmath71 , equivalent to a isotropic luminosity of @xmath72 at a distance of 3.63  mpc .",
    "this is consistent with the highest fluxes measured with chandra from x41.4 + 60 @xcite .",
    "it appears likely that x41.4 + 60 produced the flare observed with rxte .",
    "the energy spectrum that we find for x41.4 + 60 is best described by a single absorbed power - law .",
    "we find no evidence for thermal emission from a disk or for fe - k line emission .",
    "the spectrum , a featureless power - law with a relatively hard photon index , is reminiscent of the spectra of blazars , but the low level of radio emission , even during the x - ray flare , rules out a blazar identification for the source . adopting the maximum flux that we observe for the radio source 41.62 + 59.9 as an upper limit on the radio flux of x41.4 + 60 , we find that the x - ray to radio flux ratio is more than an order of magnitude larger than found for any known blazar @xcite .",
    "the absence of strong radio emission during the flare argues against it being a relativistically beamed jet source @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that ulxs may be mechanically beamed @xcite or radiating at super - eddington rates @xcite .",
    "the flux from x41.4 + 60 in the 2 - 10 kev band at the peak of from flare corresponds to a luminosity of @xmath73 at a distance of 3.63  mpc , equivalent to the eddington limit for a 580  @xmath9 object .",
    "we note that this is the observed ( absorbed ) flux . using the best fit spectral model from the chandra observation , this 2 - 10",
    "kev flux corresponds to an unabsorbed flux of @xmath74 in the 0.3 - 10 kev band for a luminosity of @xmath75 or @xmath76 in the 0.1 - 20 kev band for a luminosity of @xmath77 .",
    "the latter luminosities corresponds to the eddington limits for 1060  @xmath9 and 1600  @xmath9 objects , respectively .",
    "given that the masses of known stellar - mass black holes are all below 20  @xmath9 @xcite , this would require the inferred luminosity to exceed eddington by a factor of least 30 and more likely 50 - 80 .",
    "however , models of ` funnel ' shaped disks , as required for mechanical beaming , indicate that the maximum flux enhancement is only a factor of @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "this falls far short of the enhancement needed to explain x41.4 + 60 as a standard black hole .",
    "the formation of photon bubbles in magnetized , radiation pressure dominated disks may also lead to super - eddington luminosities .",
    "originally , the potential to reach luminosities up to a factor of 100 in excess of eddington were suggested @xcite .",
    "however , the best currently available calculations indicate enhancement factors of a few @xcite or less than 10 @xcite",
    ".    the question of whether or not black holes can radiate at substantially super - eddington luminosities can also be addressed by examination of galactic x - ray binaries and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "@xcite find that the bolometric luminosities of agn saturate at a few times the eddington luminosity . in a sample of 578 type 1 agn , @xcite find that only the most extreme objects have eddington ratios approaching 10 .",
    "we note that errors in black hole mass measurement and the agn distances may contribute to the highest eddington ratios quoted . for galactic x - ray binaries with measured black hole masses ,",
    "the highest luminosities observed are only a few times eddington @xcite .",
    "it seems that the maximum luminosities produced by accretion disks in nature exceed the eddington limit generally by no more than a factor a few and in the most extreme objects by less than a factor of 10 .",
    "given these considerations , it appears unlikely that x41.4 + 60 can be interpreted as a standard stellar - mass black hole .",
    "it s extremely high luminosity and strong variability identify it as , perhaps , the best intermediate - mass black hole candidate amongst the ulxs .",
    "our chandra observation found x42.3 + 59 at the highest flux yet seen .",
    "the 0.3 - 10  kev flux corresponds to an isotropic luminosity of @xmath79 , a dramatic increase in brightness over what was seen in previous observations .",
    "the total 2 - 10  kev flux found from the central region of m82 during the xmm - newton observation where @xcite detected a qpo was @xmath80 .",
    "it is possible that x42.3 + 59 contributed one third of the total xmm - newton flux and was the origin of the qpos .",
    "the required modulation would be 30% , which is comparable to rms fractions measured for low frequency qpos , in the range 0.6 - 2  hz , from grs 1915 + 105 @xcite .",
    "we note that our chandra timing power spectrum of x42.3 + 59 shows significant variability near 1  mhz and a possible qpo at 70  mhz , similar to that seen with xmm - newton , while the timing noise from x41.4 + 60 is consistent with poisson fluctuations in this frequency range .",
    "this may suggest that x42.3 + 59 and not x41.4 + 60 is the source of the qpos detected with xmm - newton and rxte .",
    "if the radiation is isotropic , then the minimum black hole mass for x42.3 + 59 is 85  @xmath9 .",
    "black hole x - ray binaries tend to produce qpos while in the low / hard state , which corresponds to luminosities below 10% of the eddington limit .",
    "if x42.3 + 59 is the source of the qpo detected from the central region of m82 and was is at a similar luminosity while the qpo is being produced , then the estimated black hole mass is of order 1000  @xmath9 .",
    "this may indicate the presence of a second intermediate - mass black hole candidate in m82 .",
    "we have found an apparent 62 day periodicity in the x - ray light curve of m82 , which likely arises from x41.4 + 60 , the brightest x - ray source in the galaxy .",
    "this periodicity could be due to orbital modulation , superorbital modulation , or an aperiodic phenomena .",
    "the x - ray emission of several black hole x - ray binaries is modulated at the orbital period . in particular",
    ", cygnus x-3 presents a clear case , known since 1980 @xcite , of a modulation in x - rays at the orbital period .",
    "more recently , @xcite found a modulation at the 1.7 day orbital period of lmc x-3 , a black hole x - ray binary with a high mass companion . also , recent results on systems with giant companion stars suggest that such modulations are more common than in low - mass systems . @xcite",
    "found modulations at 12 days for 1e 1740.7 - 2942 for 18 days for grs 1758 - 258 which they interpret as orbital ( they also find superorbital modulations at around 600 days ) , and @xcite found a 24.06 day period in x - rays from gx 13 + 1 , which he interprets as an orbital modulation .",
    "the modulations from these systems are roughly sinusoidal , but tend to have sharper peaks and troughs than pure sinusoids .",
    "the range of shapes is consistent with the shape of the modulation that we observe from m82 .",
    "x - ray modulation at the orbital period appears common for systems with giant companions .",
    "there are so - called super orbital modulations in the x - ray emission from x - ray binaries . for neutron star systems ,",
    "the super orbital periods include the range around 62 days .",
    "however , to produce the flux observed from x41.4 + 60 from an accreting neutron star would required a beaming factor of larger than 300 .",
    "this is much larger than has been suggested to be theoretically possible in mechanically beamed models , see above , and would require a beam with an angular spread of less than @xmath81 . for black hole x - ray binaries ,",
    "the shortest superorbital period is 162 days ( from ss 433 for which there is no dynamical mass measurement confirming its black hole status ) and the superorbital periods are more typically in the 300 - 600 day range ( for cyg x-1 , 1e 1740.7 - 2942 , and grs 1758 - 258 ) .",
    "therefore , the observed 62 day period lies outside the range of observed superorbital periods for black hole x - ray binaries .",
    "we can not exclude the possibility that the process producing the 62 day modulation could be aperiodic .",
    "however , we are not aware of any process which would produce aperiodic , but relatively coherent , behavior with the time scale and modulation amplitude seen .",
    "we conclude that the periodicity in the rxte light curve likely indicates the orbital period of x41.4 + 60 .",
    "possible orbital periodicities have been reported for a few other ulxs .",
    "the previous best candidate is cg x-1 in the circinus galaxy @xcite for which ( almost ) three periods of 7.5  hours were detected in an observation of 16.7  hours .",
    "the period was confirmed in additional ( shorter ) chandra observations and a bepposax observation of 14.4  hours @xcite , and also in an xmm - newton observation of 28.9  hours @xcite .",
    "the period is consistent with a main sequence companion with a mass near 1  @xmath9 or a similarly low mass core he - burning companion .",
    "the light curve of cg x-1 resembles that of an am herculis type cataclysmic variable star , with sharp transitions between high and low flux phases , and the source lies relatively close to the plane of the milky way @xmath82 , so it may be a foreground am her system @xcite .",
    "other reported detections of orbital modulations from ulxs are of substantially lower significance .",
    "@xcite report possible 31  hr or 41  hr periods from a 154  hr asca observation of ic 342 x-1 , but the signal is relatively weak and even extraction of the best period is ambiguous .",
    "@xcite report a possible 2.1  hr period from m51 x-7 , but only two cycles were detected in a single chandra observation of 4.2  hr .",
    "@xcite report a periodicity of 1.6  hr from the same m51 source in a 5.8  hr xmm - newton observation obtained 2.5 years after the chandra observation , so it appears unlikely that the modulation is related to the binary orbit and , instead , is either a quasiperiodic or red - noise modulation of the flux .",
    "@xcite report a suggestion of a period of 8 - 10  hr from a ulx in the elliptical galaxy ngc 3379 , but this is based on a 9  hr observation  a single orbital period .",
    "quasiperiods have been seen from several ulxs including a @xmath83  hr quasiperiod from a source in ngc 7714 @xcite and a @xmath84  hr quasiperiod from a source in m74 @xcite . however , these quasiperiods are not stable enough to be interpreted as orbital modulations .",
    "we note that very few ulxs have been monitored in a manner which would permit detection of modulations on time scales of tens of days .",
    "indeed , the program described here is the only such ulx monitoring of which we are aware .",
    "therefore , the lack of detections of modulations on time scales of tens of days may simply be an observational artifact .",
    "monitoring programs extending over 100 - 300 days with observations every day or few days would be of great interest .",
    "we note that the best available optical constraint on the nature of a ulx companion star comes from an hst spectrum from which @xcite identify the companion to ngc 5204 x-1 as a b0 ib supergiant .",
    "they predict an orbital period on the order of 10 days .",
    "this provides additional motivation for searching for x - ray modulations from ulxs with time scales of tens of days .",
    "we note that x41.4 + 60 is likely a roche - lobe overflow system because wind - fed accretion can not provide a sufficiently high mass accretion rate @xcite . in this case",
    ", the orbital period directly constrains the average density of the companion star according to the equation @xmath85 @xcite . if the orbital period is 62 days , then the mean density of the companion star is @xmath86 .",
    "this excludes main sequence stars , but would be compatible with giant stars or supergiant stars . if , instead , the 125.7  day periodicity is the orbital period , then the companion star density would be @xmath87 and the companion star must , again , be a giant or supergiant star .    as noted above , the only other ulx with a reasonably firm identification of the spectral type of the companion",
    "is ngc 5204 x-1 for which @xcite find a spectral type of b0 ib based on a far - ultraviolet spectrum .",
    "this may suggest that giant or supergiant companion stars are common in ulxs .",
    "however , more companion spectral types must be determined to drawn any firm conclusions .",
    "the spectral types for the companions to some other ulxs are been estimated using optical colors , but these classifications are suspect because optical emission from the accretion disk could affect the colors @xcite .",
    "the density of @xmath86 would be consistent with standard late k giant or late a supergiant stars .",
    "however , the properties of the companion star are significantly affected by the high rate of mass transfer , and stellar evolution calculations taking into account the mass transfer are required to properly understand the evolutionary state of the companion star .",
    "stellar evolution calculations performed by @xcite for a star with an initial mass of 15  @xmath9 orbiting a 1000  @xmath9 black hole show that the mass transfer rate exceeds @xmath88 when the companion evolves through the giant phase at 10  myr after formation of the binary .",
    "similar results are obtained by @xcite .",
    "this mass transfer rate is more than sufficient to fuel the observed x - ray luminosity of @xmath89 .",
    "the lifetime of the giant phase is relatively short , on the order of @xmath90  years .",
    "this may suggest that the ulx phase is rather short lived and that systems with very high luminosities , on the order of @xmath91 , are rare @xcite .",
    "as noted in the introduction , x41.4 + 60 lies near and possibly within the super star cluster mgg 11 .",
    "@xcite estimate that mgg 11 is 7 - 12  myr .",
    "hence , the time required for the companion to evolve to the giant phase is consistent with the age of the cluster .",
    "a possible mechanism for the formation of intermediate mass black holes with masses greater than @xmath92 is stellar collisions in the cores of dense stellar clusters @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the extremely compact size of mgg 11 , the half light radius is only 1.2  pc , causes massive stars to rapidly sink to the cluster center via dynamical friction .",
    "the time for sinking is shorter than the lifetimes of the stars , so a large number of massive stars accumulate in the cluster center where runaway collisions produce a star of @xmath93 that collapses to an intermediate mass black hole .",
    "this process does not occur in less dense clusters .",
    "the coincidence of the x41.4 + 60 with a super star cluster with the correct properties for the production of an intermediate mass black holes favors runaway collisions as the production mechanism of the ulx .",
    "other models for intermediate mass black hole formation , such as remnants of the first generation of stars @xcite or as the nuclei of captured satellite galaxies @xcite , would not predict such a coincidence .",
