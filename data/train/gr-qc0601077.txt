    "we can now superpose the waveform and its fourier transform for the one - particle case to represent two or more particles falling into a black hole and to study interference phenomena ( we are assuming that the clumps are non - interacting , so that there is no extra contribution to the total energy - momentum tensor ) .",

    "gravitational collapse - _ there are just a few calculations of gravitational wave emission from rotating gravitational collapse to a black hole .",
    "perturbative calculations were first carried out by cunningham , price and moncrief @xcite , and later improved upon by seidel and collaborators @xcite .",
    "these studies suggest that gravitational waves are mainly generated in the region where the zerilli ( or regge - wheeler ) potential is large , and that the signal is always dominated by quasinormal ringing of the finally formed black hole .",
    "simplified simulations based on a free - fall ( oppenheimer - snyder ) collapse model yield a rather pessimistic energy output , with a typical core - collapse radiating up to @xmath52 in gravitational wave energy , and most of the radiation being emitted in modes with @xmath7 .",
    "radiation in @xmath53 is typically two to three orders of magnitude smaller than the @xmath7 radiation ( see eg .",

    ".    for a long time the only _ nonperturbative _ , axisymmetric calculation of gravitational wave emission from collapse has been provided by the seminal work of stark and piran @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the waveform resembles that emitted by a point particle falling into a black hole , but with a reduced amplitude ( we will see below that a similar result emerges from head - on black hole collisions in full general relativity ) .",
    "as expected for axisymmetric configurations , the amplitude of the cross polarization mode is always @xmath54 that of the even mode , and the emission in the plus mode is dominantly quadrupolar , with a @xmath55 angular dependence ( the cross polarization has a dependence of the form @xmath56 ) .",
    "the total energy emitted is quite low ; it increases with rotation rate , ranging from @xmath57 for @xmath58 to @xmath59 as @xmath60 .",
    "rotational effects halt the collapse for some critical value of @xmath61 which is very close to unity , and depends on the amount of artificial pressure reduction used to trigger the collapse .",
    "stark and piran find that the energy emitted scales as @xmath62 for low @xmath63 : @xmath64 for @xmath65 , where @xmath66 again depends on the amount of artificial pressure reduction used to trigger the collapse .",
    "the @xmath67 waveform is very well fitted by a combination of the two lowest qnms with @xmath7 and it is only weakly sensitive to @xmath63 , reflecting the weak dependence of the slowly - damped kerr qnm frequencies on @xmath63 .",

    "@xcite picks as the initial configuration the most rapidly rotating , dynamically unstable model described by a polytropic eos with @xmath69 and @xmath70 , having a dimensionless rotation rate @xmath71 , and triggers collapse reducing the pressure by less than about @xmath72 .",
    "gravitational waves are extracted by a gauge - invariant approach in which the spacetime is matched with nonspherical perturbations of a schwarzschild black hole .",

    "odd - parity perturbations should be zero in spacetimes with axial and equatorial symmetries : they are nonzero because of the rotationally induced coupling with even - parity perturbations @xcite .",
    "the maximum amplitude from these three - dimensional simulations is @xmath77 , about one order of magnitude smaller than the amplitude found by stark and piran .",
    "correspondingly , the total energy lost to gravitational waves is @xmath78 .",

    "they use a two - dimensional code to evolve initial data corresponding to a single , nonrotating black hole superimposed with time - symmetric gravitational waves ( brill waves ) , extract gravitational waves using gauge - invariant perturbation theory and show that , for low - amplitude brill waves , non - perturbative and perturbative waveforms with @xmath7 and @xmath73 are in good agreement .",
    "a more complete analysis is due to anninos _",
    "they use three different initial data sets , corresponding to very different physical situations : non - rotating black holes distorted by time - symmetric brill waves , distorted rotating black holes , and the time - symmetric `` two black hole '' misner data . in all three cases",

    "<S> we provide some considerations on the excitation of black hole quasinormal modes ( qnms ) in different physical scenarios . considering a simple model in which a stream of particles accretes onto a black hole , </S>",
    "<S> we show that resonant qnm excitation by hyperaccretion requires a significant amount of fine - tuning , and is quite unlikely to occur in nature </S>",
    "<S> . then we summarize and discuss present estimates of black hole qnm excitation from gravitational collapse , distorted black holes and head - on black hole collisions . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize the areas that , in our opinion , are in urgent need of further investigation from the point of view of gravitational wave source modeling .    </S>",

    "<S> louis , missouri 63130 , usa    a leading candidate source of detectable waves for earth - based interferometers such as ligo , virgo , geo600 and tama , as well as for the space - based interferometer lisa , is the inspiral and merger of binary black holes . </S>",
    "<S> the waveform should comprise three parts , usually referred to as inspiral , merger and ringdown . </S>",
    "<S> the inspiral waveform , originating from that part of the decaying orbit leading up to the innermost stable orbit , can be analyzed using post - newtonian theory . </S>",
    "<S> extensive studies of the detectability of this phase of the signal have been carried out , both for earth - based @xcite and for space - based interferometers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the nature of the merger waveform is largely unknown at present , and is the subject of work in numerical relativity .    </S>",
    "<S> the ringdown waveform originates from the distorted final black hole , and consists of a superposition of quasi - normal modes ( qnms ) . </S>",
    "<S> each mode has an oscillation frequency and a damping time that are uniquely determined by the mass @xmath0 and specific angular momentum @xmath1 of the black hole @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitudes and phases of the various modes are determined by the specific process that formed the final hole .    </S>",
    "<S> the uniqueness of the modes frequencies and damping times is directly related to the `` no hair '' theorem of general relativistic black holes . </S>",
    "<S> therefore a reliable detection and accurate identification of qnms could provide the `` smoking gun '' for black holes and an important test of general relativity in the strong - field regime @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the detectability of ringdown waves , and the accuracy with which we can measure their frequencies and damping times to test the no - hair theorem , depend mainly on the energy carried by each mode @xcite . in turn </S>",
    "<S> , the energy distribution depends on the details of the merger process . </S>",
    "<S> given our poor understanding of the merger phase , we have at best sketchy information concerning the energy distribution between different modes .    in the first part of this paper we show by a simple toy model that qnm excitation by infalling matter </S>",
    "<S> requires a significant amount of fine - tuning , and is quite unlikely in astrophysically realistic scenarios . in the second part we briefly review present estimates of qnm excitation in various physical situations , including gravitational collapse , simulations of single distorted black holes and head - on collisions of two black holes </S>",
    "<S> this second part is an extended version of sec .  </S>",
    "<S> vb in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most of our considerations can be applied to the solar - mass black holes detectable by earth - based interferometers , but the main motivation for this short review comes from our study of the massive black holes detectable by lisa @xcite . throughout this paper </S>",
    "<S> we use geometrical units ( @xmath2 ) . </S>"
