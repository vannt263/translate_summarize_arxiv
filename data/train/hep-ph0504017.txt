    "recently , we have completed the hadronic production of the @xmath0-wave states of @xmath1 @xcite , that has not been included in the existent version bcvegpy1.0 @xcite yet , so we upgrade the generator here .",
    "the studies in refs.@xcite involve not only the contributions from the color - singlet components @xmath12 and @xmath13 but also those from the color - octet components @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xcite to the @xmath0-wave production .",
    "especially , it is found that the @xmath0-wave production at tevatron and lhc can be so big even as that in the same order of the magnitude for the @xmath6-wave production in certain kinematics regions . therefore , to compare with the original generator , in addition to some improvements on the program for the @xmath6-wave @xmath1 ( and @xmath16 ) production ,",
    "the main fresh feature of the upgraded version bcvegpy2.0 is that it can generate the hadroproduction of the @xmath0-wave excited @xmath1 states ( denoted by @xmath2 or by @xmath3 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) as well . at such high energies of tevatron and lhc , the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism i.e. that via the subprocess @xmath20 , is also dominant for the @xmath0-wave production @xcite , hence in the addendum we only take the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism into account .    therefore , in fact , here we just need to rewrite the program used in refs.@xcite into the format according to the environment pythia @xcite as the original version bcvegpy1.0 properly .",
    "besides that the hadronic production of the @xmath0-wave @xmath1 states is added , for convenience and increasing efficiency , some improvements in bcvegpy2.0 are made .",
    "they can be summarized as : i ) . an improved way to record the @xmath1 events is available , i.e.",
    ", all the possible information , such as various distributions of the @xmath1 events with proper kinematic cuts , can be recorded just by running the program once ; ii ) .",
    "an improved way is available to generate the useful sampling importance function just by running vegas program @xcite carefully ; iii ) .",
    "an ` extra switch ' is added , i.e. whether one switches on or off to adopt the newly improved parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) ( other than the inner pdfs provided by pythia itself ) to the simulation , so that one can apply the latest version of the pdfs provided by the several groups such as cteq @xcite , grv @xcite , mrs @xcite conveniently ; iv ) .",
    "the color flow of the processes is re - written ( as an important issue for the new version ) , so as to well - match that in pythia .    in bcvegpy1.0",
    ", the color flow is treated according to the usual fundamental - representation decomposition @xcite .",
    "since the color flow for a given hard scattering subprocess in pythia is treated in the way as that in ref.@xcite , i.e. , the color fundamental - representation decomposition is replaced by the color - flow decomposition equivalently under the large @xmath21 limit .",
    "such a color - flow decomposition has a more intuitive physical interpretation and practically it is easier to deal with than the usual fundamental - representation decomposition . hence in order to well - match with pythia and to be easy to deal with , especially , with the shower monte carlo for qcd jets , the replacement to treat the color flow as that in ref.@xcite for the relevant sub - processes is adopted in bcvegpy2.0 .    in order to increase the efficiency and to make the @xmath0-wave production amplitude as compact as possible ,",
    "we manipulate the amplitude with the help of some techniques and the software fdc ( a software for generating feynman diagrams and the algebra amplitudes , and for manipulating algebra formulae analytically etc @xcite ) . to guarantee the correctness of the program , as refs.@xcite",
    ", we have made numerical checks on the gauge invariance of the amplitude and numerical comparisons between the present obtained results and those in the literature carefully .",
    "the paper is organized : following introduction , in section ii we outline the new features of bcvegpy2.0 in detail , and explain how to use and test ( check ) the program . in sec.iii",
    ", we present some discussions on the generator and make a summary .",
    "since in hadron collisions at high energies , the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism for the hadronic production of the @xmath1 meson is dominant over the other mechanisms , thus in bcvegpy1.0 @xcite , the hadronic production of the @xmath6-wave @xmath1 and @xmath16 mesons via the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism has been accomplished . while the present target for the new version bcvegpy2.0 now essentially is to add the hadronic production of the @xmath0-wave @xmath1 states to the generator bcvegpy . in bcvegpy2.0 , for the production of the four @xmath0-wave @xmath2 ( @xmath3 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) states , not only the contributions from color - singlet components @xmath22 and @xmath23 but also those from the color - octet components @xmath24 and @xmath25 are included . the formulation and additional techniques in calculating the hadronic production of @xmath0-wave states",
    "have been given in refs.@xcite with explanations , hence for simplicity , we do not repeat them here .",
    "the readers may refer to refs.@xcite for details if they are interested in them .    to supersede the old version bcvegpy1.0 by the new version bcvegpy2.0",
    "conveniently , bcvegpy2.0 is also written into a fortran package , and it can generate the @xmath6-wave and the @xmath0-wave @xmath1 states accordingly with proper options . in bcvegpy2.0 , for comparison , the hadronic production of @xmath6-wave states @xmath26 and @xmath27 via the less important light quark - antiquark annihilation subprocess , @xmath28 , ( the annihilation mechanism ) has also been included . since bcvegpy2.0 is also written in the format as pythia ( including common block variables ) ,",
    "thus all the functions of pythia can be utilized in connection with the use of bcvegpy2.0 .",
    "bcvegpy2.0 is written in the same structure as that of bcvegpy1.0 , with some improvements in addition to the @xmath0-wave production being merged .",
    "it contains the following new features :    @xmath29 the amplitudes for the hadronic production of the color - singlet corresponding to the four @xmath0-wave states , @xmath2 or @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( j=0,1,2 ) , are included .",
    "four files to calculate the amplitudes for the @xmath0-wave states are added : p1p1amp.for , pj0amp.for , pj1amp.for and pj2amp.for , which are for the amplitudes of @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( j=0,1,2 ) respectively . while the necessary subroutines and functions for calculating the square of the amplitudes for all the @xmath0-wave states are put into the files psamp.for and lorentz.for .",
    "in fact , the file lorentz.for includes basic subroutines , which are to calculate the polarization vectors and the polarization tensor of the heavy quarkonium , and to generate short notations for typical expressions of useful contracts of the vectors and/or tensors so as to make the program more compact .",
    "three extra head files : inclamp.f , inclcon.f and inclppp.f are included in the package , which contain the frequently used common blocks for calculating each hard scattering amplitude .",
    "note here , some new techniques to compute the @xmath0-wave amplitude @xcite , such as to expand the amplitude by ` independent and elementary fermion strings ' analytically with the help of the fdc program @xcite etc . , are used instead of the original helicity ones that are used in computing the @xmath6-wave amplitude .",
    "@xmath29 to give full estimates of the @xmath0-wave production up to @xmath32 , we also take into account the contributions to the hadronic @xmath0-wave production from the color - octet components @xmath24 and @xmath33 . in the cases of the hadronic production @xmath34 with @xmath35 in color - singlet , @xmath36 or @xmath37",
    ", there are only three independent color factors ( i.e. three independent color flows @xcite ) . while in the cases of the @xmath0-wave hadronic production due to the color - octet components , such as @xmath38 with @xmath39 in color - octet , there are totally ten independent color factors @xcite .",
    "we shall show in more detail about how to deal with the color - flows in the next subsection .",
    "the hard scattering amplitudes corresponding to the color - octet components can be directly read from the eqs.(4 - 8 ) in ref.@xcite but the color - singlet matrix elements ( or the wave function at origin ) are replaced by the color - octet matrix elements @xmath40 and @xmath41 accordingly .",
    "we can approximately relate the color - octet matrix elements to the color - singlet one by nrqcd scaling rules @xcite as the method described in ref.@xcite . applying the heavy - quark spin symmetry ,",
    "the above two production matrix elements are related by @xcite @xmath42,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the total angular momentum of the hadron state .",
    "more specifically , based on the velocity scale rule@xcite , we estimate @xmath44\\label{deltas}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the second equation comes from the vacuum - saturation approximation .",
    "@xmath45 is the relative velocity between the constitute quarks in the bound states .",
    "@xmath46 is of the order @xmath32 or so , and one can take it to be within the region of 0.10 to 0.30 , which is in consistent with the identification : @xmath47 .    @xmath29 the @xmath6-wave ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) hadronic production via the less important mechanism , i.e. the light quark - antiquark annihilation mechanism with the subprocess @xmath28 , is also included in bcvegpy2.0 . in the light quark - antiquark annihilation mechanism , the technique as that in the gluon - gluon fusion one @xcite is applied , but it is much more simple ( only seven feynman diagrams are needed to be considered ) , so we do not present any detail for the calculation here .",
    "numerical results of the calculation show that its contributions to the production are smaller than those from the gluon - gluon fusion ( @xmath50 ) @xcite .",
    "@xmath29 for convenience , in order to record more data at one run which may interest us , we add 24 extra files to record the information of the generated events , and then all these output files are put in a subdirectory named data .",
    "for example , the generated files , pt005y.dat , pt020y.dat , pt035y.dat , pt050y.dat and pt100y.dat are used to record the rapidity distributions with different @xmath51 cuts , i.e. @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "the user may record other interested information in a similar way .",
    "@xmath29 with the option ivegasopen=1 , one can use the vegas program @xcite to achieve an important sampling - function , which may be used to increase the efficiency of the monte carlo simulation @xcite .",
    "otherwise one may set ivegasopen=0 .",
    "furthermore , in order to improve the precision of the existed important sampling - function obtained by previous vegas run , we add one more input parameter iveggrade , i.e. , with iveggrade=1 , one can use the existed sampling important function recorded in the file grade.dat to generate a more precise important sampling - function and record it in a new file newgrade.dat .",
    "otherwise one should set iveggrade=0 .",
    "@xmath29 pythia itself provides sixteen parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "it is known that , in fact , the pdfs are obtained through global fitting of the experimental data and then involuted to the requested characteristic scale @xmath53 by a standard way of perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) .",
    "several groups , cteq @xcite , grv @xcite and mrs @xcite etc , devote themselves to offer accurate pdfs to the world and upgrade them continually with fresh experimental data being available .",
    "bcvegpy2.0 provides a switch ( ioutpdf ) to determine which type of pdf one uses : if ( ioutpdf=1 ) , then one can use one of the latest version of pdfs from the above three groups with a proper value for the parameter ( ipdfnum ) to do the hadronic production ; otherwise , with ( ioutpdf=0 ) , one can directly use a certain existent pdf ( by setting the value of the pythia parameter mstp(51 ) ) provided in pythia to do the hadronic production . for convenience",
    ", we have downloaded all the source files for the latest version of the leading order ( lo ) pdfs of those three groups , i.e. cteq6l , grv98l and mrst2001l , and saved them into a single fortran file outerpdf.for .",
    "the three corresponding data files ( cteq6l.tbl , grv98lo.grid and lo2002.dat ) , which are necessary when running the file outerpdf.for for these three pdfs , have been also added in the package . in fact , it is shown by numerical calculations that the uncertainties for the estimates due to the different pdfs can reach up to the level @xmath54 in both cases for the @xmath6-wave and @xmath0-wave hadronic production @xcite .",
    "@xmath29 for convenience , we have written an additional file parameter.for to set the initial values of the parameters shown in tab.i .",
    "one may fix the value of ` * ireaddata * ' in parameter.for as zero ( ` * ireaddata=0 * ' ) and then one returns back the original way ( that in version 1.0 ) to set the input parameters by reading the parameter values from the date file : totput.dat . in practice ,",
    "if one want to generate a large number of results with various input parameters , we would like to suggest him / her to adopt the way of reading the input data directly from the date files accordingly .",
    "in this way , only the input files need to be changed and all the source files ( * .for ) need not to be changed , so we can save a lot of time on making the source files and furthermore , all the works can be written in a single executable file and be executed automatically .

    ", we show a test run for the hadronic production of @xmath59 @xmath8-quarkonium at the tevatron . when running the program , the initialization is shown as a screen snap - shot in table  [ output ] . here",
    "the value of @xmath60 corresponds to @xmath61 .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[totpty ] .",
    "this subsection is devoted to give a supplementary explanation on vegas .    by using vegas",
    ", one can obtain an important sampling - function ( or simply called grade function ) into the file grade.dat , and as it is well known , by using such function to do the event simulation , the efficiency can be greatly increased @xcite . a modification to the original version in ref.@xcite is done so as to record the obtained grade function into the data file grade.dat .",
    "such small trick is useful , i.e. when one wants to generate the events with the same input parameters , then one can directly apply the grade function obtained by the previous running and does not need to run vegas again . the flow chart for this part",
    "is presented in fig.[chart ] , where as mentioned above , one can use the existent grade function to do the initialization further and then to obtain a more precise grade function .    in calling vegas , we need to input two parameters , i.e. number ( maximum total number of the times to call the integrand in each iteration ) and itmx ( maximum number of allowed iterations ) .",
    "these two parameters should be adjusted in a suitable way so as to obtain a grade function in good precision and also to save the cpu as much as possible .",
    "one subtle point is that , in vegas , the default number of the column bin is 50 ( i.e. the region of ( 0,1 ) is divided into 50 pieces ) ; by taking a bigger proper value for the column bins , one can improve the production efficiency but need more iterations ( or numbers ) to obtain a stable result . in practice ,",
    "the values for number , itmx and the column bins should be carefully chosen to obtain a best important sampling - function within the least of time . in our program",
    ", we keep the column bins to be 50 ( according to our experience , it is enough ) ; however the user who wants to do some very precise studies , a proper variation of column bins might be needed .",
    "an upgrade version of @xmath1 meson generator bcvegpy2.0 is given . in this new version , the hadronic production of @xmath0-wave states up to @xmath32 , that include both the color - singlet components @xmath2 and the color - octet components @xmath62 and @xmath63 , is available . since almost all of these @xmath0-wave",
    "excited states decay to the ground state @xmath1 meson through the electromagnetic transition ( if the phase space for strong interaction transitions is not allowed ) finally , thus in fact the @xmath0-wave production provides additional contributions to the hadronic production of the @xmath1 meson . in the new version , the hadronic production of @xmath6-wave @xmath8-quarkonium from the quark - antiquark annihilation subprocess",
    "is also included for comparison , although the contributions from the quark - antiquark annihilation mechanism to the @xmath1 hadronic production , in comparison with those from gluon - gluon fusion mechanism , can be ignored safely at lhc / tevatron energies in the allowed kinematic region .    to achieve a compact program , we apply the fdc program to manipulate the amplitude of the dominant gluon - gluon fusion subprocess for the production corresponding to the four color - singlet @xmath0-wave states @xcite .",
    "the correctness of the program is guaranteed by various checks .",
    "the generator is interfaced with pythia , which takes care of producing the full event and filling the standard pythia event common block . in view of the prospects for @xmath1 physics at tevatron and at lhc ,",
