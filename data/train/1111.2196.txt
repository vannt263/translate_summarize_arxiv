    "einstein gravity has been known to have no propagating degrees of freedom in three dimensions .",

    "topologically massive gravity ( tmg ) is the famous gravity theory obtained by including a gravitational chern ",
    "simons term ( gcs ) with coupling @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "since the gcs term is odd under parity , the theory shows a single massive propagating degree of freedom of a given helicity , whereas the other helicity mode remains massless .",
    "the model was extended by adding a cosmological constant @xmath5 to the topologically massive gravity  @xcite .",
    "then , the single massive field could be realized as a massive scalar @xmath6 when employing the poincare coordinates @xmath7 and @xmath8 covering the ads@xmath9 spacetimes  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the massive graviton having negative - energy disappears at the chiral point of @xmath10 by lee - song - strominger in ref .",
    "furthermore , this cosmological topological massive gravity at the chiral point may be described by the logarithmic conformal field theory  @xcite .",
    "importantly , the lee - song - strominger work has indicated that the  third - order \" einstein equation turned out to be the  first - order \" equation for a massive graviton when choosing the transverse - traceless gauge for metric tensor .",
    "on the other hand , bergshoeff , hohm , and townsend have recently proposed another massive generalization of the einstein gravity by adding a specific quadratic curvature term to the einstein - hilbert action  @xcite .",
    "this term was designed to reproduce the ghost - free fierz - pauli action for a massive propagating graviton in the linearized approximation , whereas it differs from the fierz - pauli term when considering the non - linear terms .",
    "this gravity theory became known as new massive gravity ( nmg ) . unlike the tmg , the nmg preserves parity . as a result , the gravitons acquire the same mass for both helicity states , indicating two massive propagating degrees of freedom .",
    "considering tmg together with nmg leads to mass - splitting between helicity states .",
    "so far , we have considered only the conventional metric - perturbation approach to three - dimensional massive gravities .",
    "hence , we do not know explicitly what are polarization modes of gravitational waves ( gw ) in tmg and nmg .",
    "since two massive theories belong to higher curvature gravity , we need to introduce the newman - penrose formalism @xcite where the null real tetrad is necessary to specify polarization modes of gw , as the four - dimensional massive gravity requires null complex tetrad to specify six independent polarization modes of @xmath11 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath13 are complex , and analyzing the rotational behavior of the set shows the respective helicity values @xmath14 . it was suggested that the observations of the gw will be done in the near future , and the corresponding determination of all possible states of polarization would be a very powerful test to rule out the present studied alternative theories of gravity .    in this work , we will find the polarization modes of gravitational waves arisen from the tmg and nmg by employing the the newman - penrose formalism in three dimensions . even though these theories are not four - dimensional gravity theory",
    ", they will provide a prototype of polarization states .",
    "this work will be important to see how massive modes with different polarizations propagate in the three - dimensional minkowski spacetimes . since higher - order einstein equation becomes lower - order equation when using the linearized ricci tensor @xmath15 instead of metric tensor @xmath16 , this work will provide another approach in addition to the conventional metric - perturbation theory .",
    "let us first introduce a triad .",
    "this work shall use the notations employed in @xcite .",
    "a triad may be defined by using complex basis . however , in this case , we could not describe a propagating mode because it provides the stationary wave only . ]",

    "it is well - known that the weyl tensor vanishes identically in three dimensions .",
    "therefore , the riemann tensor with six independent components can be decomposed into the ricci tensor and ricci scalar as @xmath28\\sigma } -g_{\\sigma[\\mu}r_{\\nu]\\rho}\\big)-rg_{\\rho[\\mu}g_{\\nu]\\sigma}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on the other hand , by using the formalism of real two - component spinors @xcite , the ricci spinor @xmath29 can be expressed in terms of the ricci tensor as @xmath30 eardley et al.@xcite have shown that polarization states of the gw in four dimensions can be given by six independent components of the riemann tensor .",
    "they assumed that the gw are weak and take nearly plane waves propagating in the @xmath31 direction .",
    "accordingly , the gw have six independent modes which correspond to six independent riemann tensor of the newman - penrose tetrad . following the eardley et al .",
    "approach , we consider the plane gw propagating in the @xmath31 direction , which means that all quantities have the forms of @xmath32 only .",
    "this is equivalent to gauge - fixing ( for example , transverse gauge ) in the metric - perturbation approach . in this case",
    ", it is shown that the riemann tensor satisfies the following relation @xmath33 where @xmath34 ) run over in @xmath25 and @xmath35 run over @xmath36 . introducing a metric perturbation of @xmath37 and the linearized riemann tensor @xmath38",

    "finally , we again point out that in three dimensions , the maximum number of polarization modes for gw is three of @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( see figure 1 ) , where @xmath51 is a vector field measuring the deviation between geodesics . using the geodesic deviation equation , we check easily that in three dimensions the riemann tensor has three components of @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .",
    "accordingly , we may draw @xmath51 for three modes by considering the geodesic deviation equation and @xmath55 where @xmath56 , as depicted in fig.1 . ] . in the next section we will investigate these modes by considering three gravity theories .",
    "we mention that the procedure of determining the number of the independent component of the riemann tensor was done by choosing the plane wave solution to the vacuum linearized einstein equation .",
    "this implies that the observer is far from gw sources , which means that it is enough to solve the vacuum linearized einstein equation . in order to find polarization modes , we introduce three theories of the einstein gravity , nmg and tmg . before finding polarization modes from three theories , we wish to mention the three dimensional fierz - pauli ( fp ) massive equations which will be used to define the spin 2 in sec.3.3 and 3.4 .",
    "the einstein - hilbert action with a matter term is given by @xmath82 which yields the einstein equation @xmath83 in the case of @xmath84 , we obtain @xmath85 .",
    "considering the metric perturbation of @xmath37 , the linearized equation becomes @xmath86 using the relation ( [ tensor ] ) between @xmath26 and @xmath24 , one shows that @xmath87 correspond to @xmath88 this indicates that there is no propagating mode of the gw in einstein gravity . however , the result is nothing new because the linearized second - order equation for @xmath16 implies no graviton in three dimensions  @xcite .",
    "we would like to mention that the newman - penrose approach confirms the result of the metric - perturbation approach .      in nmg",
    "@xcite proposed by bergshoeff , hohm , and townsend , the action is given by @xmath89 where the constant @xmath90 has the mass dimension @xmath91=-1/2 $ ] , and @xmath92 and @xmath93 are dimensionless constants satisfying the important relation of @xmath94 which kills the spin-0 mode ( scalar graviton )",
    ". the wrong sign in the einstein - hilbert term is necessary to avoid the ghost . from the action ( [ actionnmg ] ) , the equation of motion for the metric can be derived as @xmath95{\\nonumber}\\\\ & & \\hspace*{-1em}-\\beta\\big[-\\frac{1}{2}g_{\\mu\\nu}r_{\\rho\\sigma}r^{\\rho\\sigma } + 2r_{\\mu\\rho\\nu\\sigma}r^{\\rho\\sigma}+\\nabla_{\\gamma}\\nabla^{\\gamma } r_{\\mu\\nu}+\\frac{1}{2}g_{\\mu\\nu}\\nabla_{\\gamma}\\nabla^{\\gamma}r -\\nabla_{\\mu}\\nabla_{\\nu}r\\big]=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] considering the metric perturbation @xmath37 , the linearized equation takes the form @xmath96 which is interpreted as the second - order equation for @xmath15 .",
    "this means that the fourth - order equation for @xmath16 could be interpreted as the second - order equation for @xmath97 with transverse - traceless ( tt ) gauge . in deriving this ,",
    "we have used the perturbation equation for the trace of eq.([nmgeq ] ) like @xmath98 together with @xmath99 .",
    "it is important to note that eq.([nmgeq2 ] ) is exactly the same with the second - order dynamical equation ( [ sodeq ] ) with @xmath100 when replacing @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "this implies that eq.([nmgeq2 ] ) describes the massive modes of helicity @xmath103 with mass @xmath104 .",
    "furthermore , the solution to eq.([nmgeq2 ] ) is given by @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath107 is a constant symmetric tensor which satisfies to the following conditions : @xmath108 from ( [ tensor ] ) and the ricci scalar in @xmath45 basis , we find that eqs.([nmgr ] ) and ( [ nmgrmunu ] ) correspond to @xmath109 respectively .",
    "this shows that the number of polarization modes of gw in the nmg is two of @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "interestingly , as was shown in @xcite , two propagating modes appear in the nmg .",
    "it is worth noting that in our approach , @xmath112 implies that there is no ghost - like massive mode of zero helicity because of @xmath113 .",
    "in addition , @xmath114 and @xmath50 correspond to the tt  ) correspond to the tt gauge in the metric - perturbation theory . ]",
    "metric - perturbation theory .",
    "their two polarization modes are depicted in @xmath115 and @xmath116 of fig .",
    "1 .    on the other hand",
    ", we may consider the general case of @xmath117 . in this case , instead of eqs.([nmgeq2 ] ) and ( [ nmgr ] ) , we obtain @xmath118 the solutions for the above equations are obtained by @xmath119 where @xmath120 and @xmath121 is a constant symmetric tensor given by @xmath122 we see that in @xmath45 basis , the solution ( [ nnmgsol ] ) corresponds to @xmath123 which mean that there exist three independent polarization modes ( @xmath124 ) in the nmg with @xmath117 .",
    "their three polarization modes are depicted in @xmath125 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 of fig .",
    "the tmg was first proposed by deser , jackiw , and templeton @xcite in the aim of making the massive gravity theory in three dimensions .",
    "the tmg action takes the form @xmath126 where @xmath4 is the gcs coupling constant and @xmath127 is the gcs term , @xmath128 the wrong sign in the einstein - hilbert term is necessary to avoid the ghost .",
    "varying the action ( [ tmgs ] ) with respect to the metric yields @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the cotton tensor defined by @xmath131 one finds that taking the trace of eq.([tmgeq ] ) leads to @xmath132 . substituting @xmath132 into eq.([tmgeq ] ) , the linearized equation can be written by @xmath133 which leads to ( [ litmg ] ) when replacing @xmath4 by @xmath134 .",
    "importantly , we point out that eq.([tmgrmunu ] ) is the third - order equation for @xmath16 , whereas it is regarded as the first - order equation for @xmath135 .",
    "it is interesting to note that eq.([tmgrmunu ] ) is equivalent to the self - dual model with ( [ eqq1 ] ) when replacing @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "apparently , from eq .",
    "( [ tmgrmunu ] ) and @xmath138 , we expect that the independent components of the riemann tensor is two of @xmath114 and @xmath50 , as was shown in the nmg",
    ". however , we have to check whether @xmath114 and @xmath50 are truly independent components even though we do not know the exact solution . to this end",
    ", we note that there are mixing between components of the ricci tensor in eq.([tmgrmunu ] ) because of the livi - civita tensor @xmath139 . from the @xmath140 and @xmath141 components of eq.([tmgrmunu ] ) , we obtain one first - order equation ( see appendix for details ) : @xmath142 which implies that @xmath143 and @xmath144 are not independent . using the @xmath145 basis",
    ", this indicates that @xmath114 and @xmath50 are not independent because @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "finally , we conclude that there exists one independent mode of gw in the tmg .",
    "if one chooses the positive gcs coupling with @xmath148 , its mode is @xmath149 , while for @xmath150 , its mode is @xmath151 or vice versa .",
    "we have found polarization modes of gravitational waves in topologically massive and new massive gravities by using the newman - penrose formalism . as was shown in fig .",
    "1 , the number of polarization modes is two [ @xmath115 and @xmath116 ] for the new massive gravity and one [ @xmath115 or @xmath116 ] for the topologically massive gravity . in order to obtain the explicit mode shape",
    ", we note that the linearized equation is equivalent to the fp massive equations which define the massive spin 2 field in three dimensions .",
    "then , using the newman - penrose formalism , we obtain all polarization modes of nmg and tmg .",
    "as far as we know , this work firstly shows what kind of massive modes are propagating in the three - dimensional minkowski spacetimes .",
    "some people have considered the tmg and the nmg as toy models of quantum gravity because they are free from the tachyon and ghosts in the metric - perturbation approach .",
    "furthermore , it was shown that the nmg is free from the non - linear ghost ( boulware - deser ghost ) to any order beyond the decoupling limit  @xcite .",
    "it shows really that the nmg represents a completely consistent ghost free theory of a fully interacting massive graviton in three dimensions  @xcite .",
    "it was claimed that this theory is renormalizable  @xcite . on the contrary , this theory seems not be renormalizable because the scalar graviton killed by choosing @xmath94 is necessary to achieve the renormalizability  @xcite .",
    "actually , the unitarity and renormalizability exclude to each other  @xcite . at this stage",
    ", we do not have any definite answer to the renormalizability of the nmg .    on the other hand , the relevant quantity to specify polarization modes is not the metric tensor @xmath16 but the linearized ricci tensor @xmath15 ( equivalently , the linearized einstein tensor @xmath78 with @xmath153 ) . if one considers @xmath15 as the physical quantity , the fourth - order linearized einstein equation for @xmath16 reduces to the second - order equation for @xmath15 , which is exactly the self - dual field equation of the fp massive equation .",
    "the latter defines the spin of massive modes . in this sense ,",
    "the nmg and tmg are considered as models of truly massive gravity in three dimensions .",
    "these two theories reflect how the lower - dimensional gravity could be realized only as massive gravity theory because the einstein gravity is trivial in three dimensions . the only and nontrivial way to provide the spin 2 field is to use the linearized ricci tensor through the newman - penrose formalism .",
    "hence , the tmg becomes the first - order theory and the nmg is the second - order theory , even though they of tmg and nmg are third- and fourth - order theory in the metric - perturbation approach .",
