    "yb - based intermetallic compounds are of interest due to their anomalous physical properties concerning to valence fluctuation and/or heavy - fermion behavior  @xcite .",
    "yb ion can have two different valence state : divalent(yb@xmath3 ) and trivalent(yb@xmath5 ) states .",
    "the former has a closed 4@xmath6 shell and thereby is nonmagnetic , whereas the latter has one hole in the 4@xmath6 shell , leading to a total angular momentum of @xmath7 = 7/2 .",
    "valence - fluctuating yb - compounds are characterized by nearly trivalent yb ions at temperatures sufficiently higher than the valence - fluctuation temperature , @xmath8 . with decreasing temperature , valence admixture with the divalent state",
    "occurs , resulting in a nonmagnetic ground state with a large density of states . since divalent",
    "yb has a larger ionic radius than trivalent yb , lattice expansion of yb - based compounds can occur on cooling .",
    "the most prominent example may be ybincu@xmath9 , which shows a first - order valence - transition at @xmath10 = 40 k  @xcite , at which the lattice abruptly expands more than 0.1% on cooling  @xcite .",
    "if such volume expansion occurs moderately to cancel the normal lattice shrinkage with decreasing temperature , the total volume change can become zero .",
    "such zero thermal - expansion has recently been reported by salvador et al . in the intermetallic compound ybgage  @xcite .",
    "it has been reported that the volume change is almost negligible in a wide temperature range from 300 k to 100 k  @xcite .",
    "the authors have also presented magnetic susceptibility data that suggest a yb valence changes from yb@xmath5 at high temperatures ( @xmath11150 k ) to nearly divalent state at low temperatures  @xcite . from these facts , they have concluded that the zero thermal - expansion is due to the valence change of yb .    lately , however , controversial results have been reported for ybgage by several authors  @xcite .",
    "margadonna et al . have reported the absence of zero thermal - expansion .",
    "they have reported that the lattice volume shrinks similarly to normal substances below 700 k  @xcite .",
    "instead , these authors have found a sudden volume change at 5 k without symmetry change , possibly due to a valence transition of yb  @xcite . on the other hand , muro et al . and bobev et al .",
    "have shown that the magnetic susceptibility of ybgage corresponds to an almost nonmagnetic state , suggesting the yb@xmath3 state in whole the temperature range  @xcite .",
    "these results are indicative of large sensitivity of magnetic and thermal properties of ybgage to the chemical composition or stoichiometry .    to clarify these discrepancies , we have studied the composition dependence of the physical properties of the ybgage system . in this paper , we report the solubility range of ybga@xmath0ge@xmath1 system , and their magnetic susceptibility and the thermal expansion .",
    "polycrystalline samples were prepared by argon arc melting from pure metals . to compensate the loss of volatile yb , a slightly richer amount of yb ( @xmath12% ) was charged .",
    "the samples were subsequently annealed in evacuated silica tubes at 750@xmath13c for 4 days . for samples with ge - rich compositions , a higher annealing temperature ( 850@xmath13c ) for 1 day",
    "was also examined .",
    "eds analysis revealed that the samples thus prepared were almost of ideal chemical composition .",
    "structure of samples were studied by powder x - ray diffraction at room temperature using cu k@xmath14 radiation with a rigaku diffractmeter .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility was measured with a squid magnetometer ( quantum design , mpms5s ) at 1000 oe .",
    "the temperature dependence of the lattice constants was investigated by means of powder x - ray diffraction using another rigaku diffractmeter .",
    "ge@xmath1 . patterns of ybga@xmath15 and yb@xmath16ge@xmath17 are calculated ones .",
    "peaks marked by @xmath18 are due to the ybga@xmath15 phase , and those marked by @xmath19 are due to yb@xmath16ge@xmath17 . , width=377 ]    at first , we have studied the stoichiometry for yb@xmath20gage .",
    "sem and eds analysis have shown that the solubility range is within 3% , indicating that the chemical composition ratio of yb:(ga , ge ) is almost 1 : 2 .",
    "next , we have studied the system ybga@xmath0ge@xmath1 . in fig.1 ,",
    "powder x - ray diffraction patterns of ybga@xmath0ge@xmath1 are shown .",
    "the pattern of @xmath4=1.0 , i.e. , ybgage , well agrees with a calculation ( not shown ) based on the structure parameter reported in ref  @xcite .",
    "it is seen in the figure that the ybga@xmath0ge@xmath1 compounds have the same crystal structure up to @xmath4 = 1.5 , i.e. , ybga@xmath22ge@xmath23 . for @xmath24 , additional peaks are found to develop , which are attributed to the ybga@xmath15 phase with cain@xmath15-type structure  @xcite , as is seen in the figure , where the peaks from the ybga@xmath15 phase are marked by asterisks .",
    "for @xmath25 the solubility range has been found to be narrow . in fig.1 ,",
    "the patterns for @xmath4=0.9 and 0.8 are shown .",
    "one can see that peaks due to the yb@xmath16ge@xmath17 phase appear for @xmath26 .",
    "these data are those of the samples annealed at 850@xmath13c and subsequently quenched . for samples annealed at 750@xmath13c",
    ", the yb@xmath16ge@xmath17 phase is seen even for @xmath4 = 0.9 , suggesting that the solubility range is narrower at low temperatures . from these results , it is concluded that the single - phase region of ybga@xmath0ge@xmath1 is @xmath2 .      in fig.2 , the lattice constants of ybga@xmath0ge@xmath1 are shown .",
    "these lattice constants were determined by a least square method using the peak position of the ( 3 0 0 ) , ( 1 1 12 ) , ( 2 1 8) , and ( 2 0 12 ) reflections .",
    "it is found that with increasing ga concentration @xmath4 , @xmath27 increases monotonically . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath21 does not show a monotonic composition dependence .",
    "the origin of this is not yet clear .",
    "nevertheless , the unit cell volume varies monotonically with @xmath4 in the single - phase region ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "we have found that the standard deviation for the estimation of lattice constants becomes extremely large for @xmath29 when we use the ( @xmath30 ) peaks with odd @xmath31 numbers , such as ( 2 1 7 ) and ( 2 0 11 ) .",
    "this is probably due to stacking faults along the @xmath21-direction for ga - rich compositions , as is shown below .    in fig.3 ,",
    "x - ray diffraction patterns of ybga@xmath0ge@xmath1 at high angles are shown .",
    "one can see that the ( 3 0 0 ) peak monotonically shifts to lower angles with increasing @xmath4 , indicating the monotonic increase of @xmath27 . on the other hand",
    ", other reflections do not show such simple @xmath4-variations .",
    "for the ( 2 1 7 ) and ( 2 0 11 ) reflections , the peaks shift to lower angles with increasing @xmath4 . especially for @xmath29 , the peaks shift rapidly .",
    "in contrast , the ( 2 1 8) and ( 2 0 12 ) reflections do not shift rapidly to lower angles , or even shift to higher angles for @xmath29 .",
    "it is also noticeable that the intensities of the peaks with odd @xmath31 show a remarkable decrease for @xmath29 , whereas those with even @xmath31 are almost unchanged .",
    "these @xmath4 variations can not be explained by an @xmath4-dependence of the lattice parameters .",
    "it should be noted that for ybgage , the ga - ge layers are stacked along the @xmath21 direction with the sequence @xmath32  @xcite . on the other hand , for ybga@xmath15 , the ga layers stack as @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "we speculate for ybga@xmath0ge@xmath1 with large @xmath4 , that the stacking of @xmath34 is inserted in the regular @xmath35 stacking . for the case of complete @xmath34 stacking , ( @xmath36 ) reflection with odd @xmath31 should vanish .",
    "thereby the insertion of @xmath34 in the regular @xmath35 stacking can lead to an incommensurate modulation of the @xmath37-value of these plains , giving rise to an @xmath4-dependence of the peak positions different from that expected from the lattice constants .",
    "having determined the single phase region to be @xmath2 , we show the physical properties of the ybga@xmath0ge@xmath1 system . in fig.4 , the magnetic susceptibility @xmath39 of ybga@xmath0ge@xmath1",
    "is shown together with that reported by salvador et al . in ref .",
    "@xcite . in a good contrast to the data of ref .",
    "@xcite , our data show that the susceptibility of ybga@xmath0ge@xmath1 is extremely small in whole the range of @xmath4 .",
    "we have fitted the data between 150 and 300 k using a curie - weiss function : @xmath40 , where @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 are the curie constant , weiss temperature , and temperature - independent susceptibility , respectively . here",
    "@xmath41 is written as @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the concentration of yb@xmath5 per formula unit , @xmath46 the avogadro number , @xmath47 the effective magnetic moment , and @xmath48 the boltzmann constant .",
    "@xmath47 should be 4.54@xmath49 for the case of yb@xmath5 .",
    "the results of fitting have yielded a value of @xmath50 , which corresponds to @xmath51 .",
    "this indicates that most of the yb ions are nonmagnetic , i.e. , in the yb@xmath3 state .",
    "this result is consistent with the results of x - ray photoemission spectroscopy measurement on polycrystalline samples  @xcite .",
    "the low temperature increase in @xmath39 is then attributed to a small amount of impurities .",
    "since the yb@xmath3 state is consistently dominant for all the @xmath4 measured , we conclude that the valence of the yb ions in ybga@xmath0ge@xmath1 is divalent , independent of the chemical composition .",
    "in addition , no magnetic transition was observed down to 3 k. in several samples , a very tiny transition was observed at 2.3 k , and this is attributed to the antiferromagnetic transition in a trace of yb@xmath15o@xmath16 , of which the nel temperature is @xmath52 = 2.2 k  @xcite .",
    "this contrasts with the valence transition around 5 k suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "since the ionic radius of yb@xmath3 is larger than that of yb@xmath5 , a volume expansion with decreasing temperatures or zero thermal - expansion should not occur for these systems , as far as the valence - change mechanism is concerned . to confirm this expectation ,",
    "we have studied the thermal expansion of ybga@xmath0ge@xmath1 , of which results are shown in fig .",
    "5 . for ybgage ,",
    "both @xmath27 and @xmath21 decrease monotonically with decreasing temperatures as in normal substances . as a result",
    ", the lattice volume also shows a monotonical decrease on cooling . this result for @xmath4 = 1.0",
    "is consistent with that reported for ybgage by several authors  @xcite .",
    "moreover , a similar lattice expansion is seen for the other samples , @xmath4 = 0.9 , 0.94 , and 1.2 , where @xmath27 , @xmath21 , and the lattice volumes show a conventional decrease on cooling .",
    "this behavior well agrees with the divalent yb state in these systems , because yb@xmath3 ions can no longer expand through a valence transition mechanisms .    in summary",
    ", we have determined the solubility range of the ybga@xmath0ge@xmath1 system . in the composition range of @xmath2 , it is found that single phase samples isostructural to ybgage are formed .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility of these samples reveals that the yb ions are consistently divalent .",
    "this should lead a normal lattice shrinkage with decreasing temperature .",
    "in fact , x - ray diffraction shows normal lattice shrinkage on cooling in these systems .",
    "these results lead us the conclusion that the valence state of yb in ybga@xmath0ge@xmath1 is not sensitive to the composition @xmath4 but is robustly divalent , and that a zero thermal expansion does not occur in ybga@xmath0ge@xmath1 for whole the composition range ( @xmath2 ) , at least not via a valence transition mechanism .",
    "the ybgage phase with yb@xmath5 ions may be obtained at much smaller @xmath4 , because yb@xmath5 favors smaller lattice volumes . however , such samples were not obtained by conventional arc melting or annealing technique . other method such as",
    "high pressure synthesis may be useful .",
