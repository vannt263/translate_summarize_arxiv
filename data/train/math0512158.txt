    "@xcite were able to prove @xmath44 for every finite point set @xmath45 and they showed lower bounds for some special cases .",
    "a natural idea for embedding @xmath13 in a planar graph of small dilation is to try to find a geometric graph  @xmath46 , @xmath47 , such that @xmath48 for every @xmath49 . now , suppose we have found such @xmath35 .",
