    "in the paper @xcite , a general framework was given for describing categorical structures consisting of the existence of finite limits as well as certain types of colimits , along with exactness conditions stating that the limits and colimits interact in the same way as they do in a topos .",
    "these exactness conditions always include the fact that the colimits in question are stable under pullback ; usually , there are further conditions .",
    "we may sometimes speak of the colimits in question being `` well - behaved '' when the corresponding exactness conditions hold , it being understood that the paradigm for good behaviour is that which occurs in a topos .",
    "examples of colimit types considered in @xcite include coequalizers of kernel pairs , coequalizers of equivalence relations , and finite coproducts ; the corresponding exactness conditions are then regularity , barr - exactness , and lextensivity . but",
    "for this paper , the key example from @xcite is that in which the colimits in question are the pushouts along monomorphisms ; the resulting categorical structure turns out to be that of an _ adhesive category _ , first introduced in @xcite .",
    "any small adhesive category admits a structure - preserving full embedding into a topos : this was proved in @xcite .",
    "since every topos is adhesive , and every small adhesive category admits a full structure - preserving embedding into a topos , we see that the exactness conditions between pushouts along monomorphisms and finite limits which hold in an adhesive category are indeed precisely those which hold in any topos .",
    "in fact terminal objects are not assumed in the definition of adhesive category , and we work with pullbacks rather than all finite limits .",
    "this does not affect the issues of limit - colimit compatibility .",
    "adhesive categories were first introduced in order to simplify and unify various structures considered in the area of _ graph transformations _",
    "@xcite , and it was clear from the start that some of the categories of interest failed to be adhesive but still shared many of the same properties .",
    "there are two ways in which one could weaken the notion of adhesive category so as to try to include more examples .",
    "one possibility is to restrict the class of colimits which are required to be well - behaved .",
    "we shall characterize those categories with pullbacks and with pushouts along regular monomorphisms , in which the same exactness conditions hold as in a topos .",
    "they turn out to be precisely those categories which were called _ quasiadhesive _ in @xcite .",
    "the name quasiadhesive comes from the fact that a quasiadhesive category is defined similarly to an adhesive category except that one uses regular monomorphisms in place of monomorphisms , just as a quasitopos is defined similarly to a topos except that one uses regular monomorphisms in place of monomorphisms .",
    "but in fact this analogy is misleading , since quasiadhesive categories have little to do with quasitoposes ; in particular , as shown in @xcite , a quasitopos need not be quasiadhesive . rather than quasiadhesive , we shall use the name _ rm - adhesive _ for the categories occurring in this characterization ; see below .",
    "a second possibility would be to relax the requirements of good behaviour for the colimits in question .",
    "no doubt there are many possible such relaxations , but we shall consider just one : requiring only those exactness conditions which hold in a quasitopos .",
    "in fact we shall have nothing to say about the categories with pullbacks , pushouts along _ all _ monomorphisms , and the exactness conditions holding in a quasitopos .",
    "but we shall introduce a further structure , that of an _ rm - quasiadhesivecategory _ , which will turn out to be that obtained by applying both weakenings : thus a category is rm - quasiadhesivejust when it admits pushouts along regular monomorphisms and pullbacks , with the same exactness properties holding between these as hold in a quasitopos .    in this paper , we prove four theorems about categorical structures involving pushouts along some class of monomorphisms ( either all of them or just the regular ones ) satisfying exactness conditions of either the stronger or the weaker type .",
    "we devote the remainder of the introduction to an explanation of the content and significance of these theorems .",
    "we have discussed above notions of adhesive , rm - adhesive , and rm - quasiadhesivecategory in terms of exactness conditions holding in a topos or quasitopos , but the actual definitions of these notions are elementary , asserting properties of certain kinds of diagram in such categories .",
    "a category with pullbacks and with pushouts along monomorphisms is said to be adhesive when the pushouts along monomorphisms are _ van kampen _ ; the name coming from the fact that this condition is formally similar to the statement of the coverings form of the van kampen theorem @xcite .",
    "explicitly , the condition says that for any cube @xmath0_{m ' } \\ar'[d][dd]_c \\ar[rr]^{f ' } & & b ' \\ar[dl]^{n ' } \\ar[dd]^{b } \\\\   a ' \\ar[dd]_{a } \\ar[rr]^(0.7){g ' } & & d ' \\ar[dd]^(0.7){d } \\\\ & c \\ar'[r][rr]^(0.5){f } \\ar[dl]_{m } & & b \\ar[dl]^{n } \\\\ a \\ar[rr]_{g } & & d } \\ ] ] with the bottom face as the given square and with the left and back faces as pullbacks , the top face is a pushout if and only if the front and right faces are pullbacks . an elegant reformulation of the van kampen condition",
    "was given in @xcite , where it was shown that a pushout along a monomorphism is van kampen just when it is also a ( bicategorical ) pushout in the bicategory of spans .",
    "the `` if '' part of the van kampen condition says that the pushout is stable under pullback .",
    "we shall from now on use the adjective `` stable '' to mean `` stable under pullback '' .",
    "it is easy to see that a van kampen square is a pullback as well as a stable pushout ; in general , however , there can be stable pushouts which are pullbacks but fail to be van kampen .",
    "we now collect together the elementary definitions of our various notions .",
    "a category with pullbacks is said to be :    a.   _ adhesive _ if it has pushouts along monomorphisms and these are van kampen ; b.   _ rm - adhesive _ if it has pushouts along regular monomorphisms and these are van kampen ; c.   _ rm - quasiadhesive _ if it has pushouts along regular monomorphisms and these are stable and are pullbacks .",
    "it might appear that we should have considered a fourth possibility , namely the categories which have pushouts along monomorphisms that are stable and are pullbacks , but need not be van kampen .",
    "our first theorem states that in this case the pushouts along monomorphisms must in fact be van kampen , and so this apparently different notion coincides with that of adhesive category .",
    "it will be proved as part of theorem  [ thma ] below .",
    "a category with pullbacks is adhesive if and only if it has pushouts along monomorphisms , and these pushouts are stable and are pullbacks .    in fact",
    "this characterization was observed in @xcite , with an indirect proof based on the fact that the proof of the embedding theorem for adhesive categories given in @xcite used only the elements of the new characterization , not the van kampen condition . the proof given below ,",
    "however , is direct .",
    "if we take the equivalent condition given in the theorem as the definition of adhesive category , then the fact that every topos is adhesive @xcite becomes entirely standard .",
    "our second main result , proved as corollary  [ thmb ] below , describes the relationship between rm - adhesiveand rm - quasiadhesivecategories :      a category is rm - adhesivejust when it is rm - quasiadhesiveand regular subobjects are closed under binary union .",
    "this is a sort of refinement of the result in @xcite which states that a quasitopos is rm - adhesive(there called quasiadhesive ) if and only if regular subobjects are closed under binary union . as observed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary  20 ) , the category of sets equipped with a binary relation is a quasitopos , and so rm - quasiadhesive , but fails to be rm - adhesive .",
    "the remaining two theorems are embedding theorems , and complete the characterizations of rm - adhesiveand rm - quasiadhesivecategories as those with pushouts along regular monomorphisms satisfying the exactness conditions which hold in a topos or a quasitopos .",
    "let @xmath1be a small category with all pullbacks and with pushouts along regular monomorphisms .",
    "then @xmath1is rm - adhesivejust when it has a full embedding , preserving the given structure , into a topos .",
    "it follows from the theorem that the condition of being rm - adhesivecan be seen as an exactness condition in the sense of @xcite .",
    "the theorem also clinches the argument that the name quasiadhesive does not really belong with the condition that all pushouts along regular monomorphisms be van kampen ; this condition is related to toposes rather than quasitoposes .",
    "let @xmath1be a small category with all pullbacks and with all pushouts along regular monomorphisms .",
    "then @xmath1is rm - quasiadhesivejust when it has a full embedding , preserving the given structure , into a quasitopos .",
    "one direction of each theorem is immediate , since every topos is adhesive and every quasitopos is rm - quasiadhesive .",
    "the converse implications are proved in theorems  [ thmc ] and  [ thmd ] respectively ; the theorems themselves are stated as corollaries  [ corc ] and  [ cord ] .",
    "we have found it convenient to give the name _ adhesive morphism _ to a morphism @xmath2 ( necessarily a regular monomorphism ) with the property that pushouts along any pullback of @xmath2 are stable and are pullbacks .",
    "one aspect of the convenience is that we can then deal simultaneously with the context where all monomorphisms are adhesive and that where all regular monomorphisms are adhesive .",
    "other authors have defined adhesiveness with respect to an abstract class of morphisms ",
    "see @xcite and the references therein  but this is subtly different . rather than specifying a class of morphisms and asking that pushouts along them be suitably well behaved , we are instead considering the class of all morphisms along which pushouts are suitably well behaved .",
    "we introduce and study these adhesive morphisms in section  [ sect : adh ] .",
    "then in section  [ sect : vk ] we look at when pushouts along adhesive morphisms are van kampen squares , and prove the first two theorems described above . finally in section  [",
    "sect : emb ] we look at structure preserving embeddings of rm - adhesiveand rm - quasiadhesive categories , and prove the last two theorems .",
    "the second - named author is grateful to peter johnstone and pawesobociski for helpful conversations in relation to the content of the paper .",

    "all adhesive morphisms are pre - adhesive .",
    "all pre - adhesive morphisms are regular monomorphisms .",
    "any isomorphism is obviously pre - adhesive , but the pullback of an isomorphism is still an isomorphism , and so isomorphisms are adhesive .",
    "the second statement is a triviality . as for the third , if @xmath2 is pre - adhesive , then it is the pullback of its pushout along itself .",
    "this says that it is the equalizer of its cokernel pair , and so is a regular monomorphism .",
    "we shall repeatedly use the standard results about pasting and cancellation of pullbacks and pushouts : if in a diagram @xmath3 \\ar[d ] & \\ar[r ] \\ar[d ] & \\ar[d ] \\\\ \\ar[r]_r & \\ar[r ] & } \\ ] ] the right square is a pullback , then the left square is a pullback just when the composite rectangle is one ; dually , if the left square is a pushout , then the right square is a pushout just when the composite rectangle is one .",

    "we are now ready to give our first main theorem , providing a new characterization of adhesive categories .",
    "[ thma ] for a category @xmath1with pullbacks , the following conditions are equivalent :    a.   @xmath1is adhesive ; b.   all monomorphisms are adhesive ; c.",
    "@xmath1has pushouts along monomorphisms , and these pushouts are stable and are pullbacks .    here condition ( @xmath66 ) says that all monomorphisms are pre - adhesive .",
    "clearly ( @xmath67 ) implies ( @xmath68 ) and ( @xmath68 ) implies ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "if all monomorphisms are pre - adhesive , then since the pullback of a monomorphism is a monomorphism , all monomorphisms are in fact adhesive ; this shows that ( @xmath66 ) implies ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "finally if all monomorphisms are adhesive , then certainly the adhesive subobjects are closed under binary union , so all pushouts along monomorphisms are van kampen by proposition  [ prop : adhesive ] .",
    "thus ( @xmath68 ) implies ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "we recall from the introduction that we define a category to be rm - adhesive if it has all pullbacks and all pushouts along regular monomorphisms , and these pushouts are van kampen ; while if instead these pushouts are only assumed to be stable and to be pullbacks , then the category is called rm - quasiadhesive .",
    "thus a category with pullbacks is rm - quasiadhesiveif and only if all regular monomorphisms are adhesive .",
    "we also reiterate the warning that the notion here being called rm - adhesivewas formerly known as quasiadhesive .    for a category @xmath1with pullbacks ,",
    "the following conditions are equivalent :    a.   @xmath1is rm - adhesive ; b.   all regular monomorphisms are adhesive , and regular subobjects are closed under binary union ; c.   @xmath1has",
    "pushouts along regular monomorphisms , these pushouts are stable and are pullbacks , and regular subobjects are closed under binary union .",
    "the downward implications are all straightforward , once we note the fact , proved in @xcite , that in an rm - adhesivecategory , the union of two regular subobjects is again regular .",
    "the upward implications are proved just as in the proof of the previous theorem .    in particular , we have the following result , which refines the fact @xcite that a quasitopos is rm - adhesiveif and only if the union of two regular subobjects is again regular .",
    "[ thmb ] a category is rm - adhesivejust when it is rm - quasiadhesiveand regular subobjects are closed under binary union .",
    "any locally presentable locally cartesian closed category of course has all colimits and these are all stable under pullback .",
    "this is not enough to imply that the category is rm - quasiadhesive , as the following example shows .",
    "the example was originally given in @xcite , attributed to admek and rosick , as an example of a locally presentable and locally cartesian closed category which is not a quasitopos .",
    "let @xmath69be the category of sets equipped with a reflexive binary relation with the property that @xmath70 for all @xmath71 . as observed in (",
    "* section  4 ) , this is locally cartesian closed and locally presentable , but the regular monomorphism given by the inclusion @xmath72 is not classified , where @xmath73 consists only of the diagonal , and where @xmath74 consists of the diagonal as well as @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "in fact the pushout of this inclusion along the unique map from @xmath77 to the terminal object is clearly just the terminal object , and so this pushout is not also a pullback .",
    "thus @xmath69is not rm - quasiadhesive .",
    "in this section we prove various embedding theorems . in each case , the category @xmath1will be fully embedded into a full subcategory @xmath69of the presheaf category @xmath78 $ ] , via the corresponding restricted yoneda functor ; the category @xmath69will be a topos or a quasitopos , as appropriate ; and the embedding will preserve the relevant colimits .",
    "the yoneda functor @xmath79 $ ] , of course , preserves limits but not colimits ; we fix this by choosing @xmath69appropriately .",
    "the preservation of colimits will occur provided that all presheaves @xmath80 lying in @xmath69send the relevant colimits in @xmath1to limits in * set*. in order to guarantee that @xmath69is a topos , we take it to be the category of sheaves for a topology @xmath81 ; we choose @xmath81 in such a way that the representables are sheaves , and all sheaves send the relevant colimits in @xmath1to limits in * set*. if instead we only need @xmath69to be a quasitopos , then we need only take @xmath69to be the category of @xmath81-sheaves which are also @xmath50-separated , where @xmath81 and @xmath50 are topologies , with @xmath50 containing @xmath81 : such quasitoposes are called grothendieck quasitoposes , and were studied in @xcite . in each case",
    "@xmath81 will be a cd - topology , in the sense of @xcite .",
    "suppose that @xmath1is a small category with pullbacks .",
    "since pushouts along adhesive morphisms are stable , there is a topology @xmath81 on @xmath1 in which the covering families are those of the form @xmath82 for some pushout @xmath30^f \\ar[d]_m & b \\ar[d]^n \\\\ a \\ar[r]_g & d } \\ ] ] with @xmath2 adhesive .",

    "first suppose that split monomorphisms are adhesive , and adhesive subobjects are closed under binary union .",
    "then by lemma  [ lemma : basic ] , the diagram @xmath30^{\\gamma } \\ar[d]_{m } & c_2 \\ar[d]^{m_2 } \\\\ a \\ar[r]_{\\delta } & a_2}\\ ] ] is a pushout along the adhesive morphism @xmath2 , and so @xmath86 is a covering family .",
    "since both @xmath45 and @xmath43 are monomorphisms , any sheaf @xmath87 sends this pushout to a pullback in * set * , and so in particular @xmath88 and @xmath89 are jointly monic .",
    "as explained in @xcite , this now allows the sheaf condition given in terms of the diagram above to be simplified to the requirement that the square in that diagram be a pullback ; the argument is sufficiently short that it is worth repeating here .",
    "suppose that @xmath90 and @xmath91 are given , with @xmath92 ; we must show that also @xmath93 , so that by the sheaf condition there is a unique @xmath94 with @xmath95 and @xmath96 . to do this ,",
    "observe that @xmath97 thus since @xmath88 and @xmath89 are jointly monic , @xmath93 as required .",
    "the sheaves are therefore precisely those presheaves which send pushouts along adhesive morphisms to pullbacks . then the restricted yoneda embedding @xmath98 preserves such pushouts as well as any existing limits .",
    "this proves :    for any small category @xmath1with pullbacks , in which split monomorphisms are adhesive , and adhesive subobjects are closed under binary union , there is a full embedding of @xmath1into a topos , and this embedding preserves pushouts along adhesive morphisms as well as all existing limits .",
    "conversely , it is well - known that every topos satisfies the conditions in the definition of rm - adhesivecategory , hence so will any full subcategory closed under the relevant limits and colimits .",
    "thus we have :    [ corc ] let @xmath1be a small category with all pullbacks and with pushouts along regular monomorphisms .",
    "then @xmath1is rm - adhesivejust when it has a full embedding , preserving the given structure , into a topos .",
    "we now turn to the embedding theorem for rm - quasiadhesivecategories .",
    "first , however , we need to develop the theory of such categories a little .",
    "the next result is essentially contained in @xcite , although the context there was slightly different .",

    "since cokernel pairs of regular monomorphisms are pushouts along a regular monomorphism , they are stable under pullback , and so @xmath110 is the cokernel pair of @xmath111 , and @xmath112 is the codiagonal .",
    "since @xmath109 is a regular monomorphism , we can form the pushout @xmath113^{e_2 } \\ar[d]_{\\ell } & a_2 \\ar[d]^{k } \\\\",

    "since @xmath117 , there is a unique @xmath119 with @xmath120 and @xmath121 . on the other hand @xmath122 and",
    "so the morphism @xmath123 out of the cokernel pair @xmath124 of @xmath111 agrees on the coprojections @xmath125 and @xmath126 of the cokernel pair , and therefore factorizes through the codiagonal @xmath127 , say as @xmath128 . by the universal property of the pushout @xmath129",
    ", there is a unique @xmath130 with @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "now @xmath133 and @xmath134 , and it is easy to see that @xmath135 is unique with the property , thus proving that @xmath136 and @xmath137 give the cokernel pair of @xmath2 .",
    "since @xmath136 and @xmath137 are a cokernel pair , they have a common retraction ( the codiagonal ) , and so we can form their equalizer @xmath138 as their intersection ; this is of course a regular monomorphism .",
    "since @xmath139 , there is a unique map @xmath140 with @xmath141 ; we must show that @xmath142 is a stable epimorphism .",
    "in fact it will suffice to show that it is an epimorphism , since all these constructions are stable under pullback along a map into @xmath143 , thus if @xmath142 is an epimorphism so will be any pullback .    to see that @xmath142 is an epimorphism , first note that @xmath107 and @xmath43 factorize as @xmath144 , and now @xmath145 and @xmath146 are regular monomorphisms with union @xmath142 .",
    "so once again we can factorize @xmath142 as @xmath147 , where @xmath25 is a regular monomorphism constructed as before .    observe that @xmath142 is an epimorphism if and only if its cokernel pair is trivial , which in turn is equivalent to the equalizer @xmath25 of this cokernel pair being invertible . in an rm - adhesivecategory",
    "the regular monomorphisms are precisely the adhesive morphisms , and so are closed under composition .",
    "thus the composite @xmath148 of the regular monomorphisms @xmath14 and @xmath25 is itself a regular monomorphism .",
    "we conclude , using a standard argument , by showing that @xmath25 is invertible and so that @xmath142 is an epimorphism .",
    "observe that @xmath136 and @xmath137 are the cokernel pair of @xmath149 , as well as of their equalizer @xmath14 .",
    "but then they are also certainly the cokernel pair of @xmath148 .",
    "since this last is a regular monomorphism , it must be the equalizer of @xmath136 and @xmath137 , but then it must be ( isomorphic to ) @xmath14 , so that @xmath25 is invertible as claimed .",
    "[ prop : stably - jointly - epi ] if @xmath12 is a regular monomorphism and @xmath40 an arbitrary morphism in an rm - quasiadhesivecategory , then the induced maps @xmath54 and @xmath55 are stably jointly epimorphic .",

    "thus we can factorize it as a stable epimorphism @xmath150 followed by a regular monomorphism @xmath151 . since @xmath142 is an epimorphism , the square @xmath152^{g_1\\overline{k } } \\ar[d]_{\\overline{k } } & a \\ar[d]^{1 } \\\\",
