    "in 1997 , belabas @xcite presented an algorithm for tabulating all non - isomorphic cubic number fields of discriminant @xmath1 with @xmath9 for any @xmath10 . in the above context , _ tabulation _ means that all non - isomorphic fields with discriminant @xmath9 are listed or written to a file , by listing the minimal polynomial for each respective field .",
    "the results make use of the reduction theory for binary cubic forms with integral coefficients . a theorem of davenport and heilbronn @xcite states that there is a discriminant - preserving bijection between @xmath11-isomorphism classes of cubic number fields of discriminant @xmath1 and a certain explicitly characterizable set @xmath12 of equivalence classes of primitive irreducible integral binary cubic forms of the same discriminant @xmath1 .",
    "using this one - to - one correspondence , one can enumerate all cubic number fields of discriminant @xmath1 with @xmath9 by computing the unique reduced representative @xmath13 of every equivalence class in @xmath12 of discriminant @xmath1 with @xmath9 . the corresponding field",
    "is then obtained by simply adjoining a root of the irreducible cubic @xmath14 to @xmath15 .",
    "belabas algorithm is essentially linear in @xmath16 , and performs quite well in practice .    in this paper",
    ", we give an extension of the above approach to function fields .",
    "that is , we present a method for tabulating all @xmath0-isomorphism classes of cubic function fields over a fixed finite field @xmath17 up to a given upper bound on the degree of the discriminant , using the theory of binary cubic forms with coefficients in @xmath18 $ ] , where @xmath19  is a finite field with char@xmath20 .",
    "the discriminant @xmath1 must also satisfy certain technical conditions , which we detail below .",
    "this paper is a substantial expansion and extension of the material in @xcite and corresponds to chapters 4 and 6 of the first author s ph.d thesis , prepared under the supervision of the last two authors .",
    "the present paper includes a more detailed description of the algorithm in the unusual discriminant case and improved bounds on the coefficients of a reduced form compared to those appearing in @xcite . another somewhat complementary approach to tabulating cubic function fields different from the one taken in this paper",
    "is described in @xcite , and relies on computations of quadratic ideals to construct all cubic function fields of a given fixed discriminant .",
    "the approach in @xcite is limited to finite fields @xmath17 where @xmath21 , and unlike our algorithm , considers only fixed discriminants and not all discriminants @xmath1 with @xmath5 bounded above .",
    "our main tool is the function field analogue of the davenport - heilbronn theorem @xcite mentioned above , which generalizes to dedekind domains ( see taniguchi @xcite ) . as in the case of integral forms ,",
    "we also make use of the association of any binary cubic form @xmath22 of discriminant @xmath1 over @xmath18 $ ]  to its hessian @xmath23 which is a binary quadratic form over @xmath18$]of discriminant @xmath2 . under certain conditions on the discriminant",

    "we will establish that under these conditions , the equivalence class of @xmath22 contains a unique reduced form , i.e.  a binary cubic form that satisfies certain normalization conditions and has a reduced hessian .",
    "thus , equivalence classes of binary cubic forms can be efficiently identified via their unique representatives .",
    "the case where @xmath5 is odd is analogous to the case of definite binary quadratic forms , but the other case has no number field analogue .",

    "hence , in order to list all @xmath24-isomorphism classes of cubic function fields up to an upper bound @xmath4 on @xmath5 , it suffices to enumerate the unique reduced representatives of all equivalence classes of binary cubic forms of discriminant @xmath1 for all @xmath26 @xmath18 $ ] with @xmath27 .",
    "bounds on the coefficients of such a reduced form show that there are only finitely many candidates for a fixed discriminant .",
    "these bounds can then be employed in nested loops over the coefficients to test whether each form found lies in @xmath12 .",
    "the coefficient bounds obtained for function fields are different from those used by belabas for number fields , due to the fact that the degree valuation is non - archimedean .",

    "<S> we present a method for tabulating all cubic function fields over @xmath0 whose discriminant @xmath1 has either odd degree or even degree and the leading coefficient of @xmath2 is a non - square in @xmath3 , up to a given bound @xmath4 on @xmath5 . our method is based on a generalization of belabas method for tabulating cubic number fields . </S>",
    "<S> the main theoretical ingredient is a generalization of a theorem of davenport and heilbronn to cubic function fields , along with a reduction theory for binary cubic forms that provides an efficient way to compute equivalence classes of binary cubic forms . </S>",
    "<S> the algorithm requires @xmath6 field operations as @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the algorithm , examples and numerical data for @xmath8 are included . </S>"
