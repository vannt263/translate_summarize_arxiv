    "in the few gev energy region , experiments using neutrino as well as antineutrino beams on nuclear targets are being performed to measure precisely some of the parameters of pmns matrix , determination of cp violation in the leptonic sector , etc .",
    "( anti)neutrino cross section in this energy region is difficult to simulate as the contribution to the cross section comes from various scattering processes like quasielastic , one pion and multi pion production , associated particle production , jet of hadrons production in the deep inelastic scattering region , etc . for quasielastic(qe )",
    "process induced by antineutrinos there is an additional qe channel where a lepton is produced from nucleon target through the reaction @xmath2(@xmath3 ) i.e. a hyperon is produced in the final state .",
    "this channel is not allowed in the neutrino sector due to @xmath4 selection rule .",
    "this process although cabibbo suppressed has lower energy threshold ( 0.19 gev for @xmath5 and 0.32 gev for @xmath6 ) , in comparison to strangeness conserving associated particle production process ( 0.9 gev for @xmath7 and 1.1 gev for @xmath8 ) . in the case of inelastic channels , the first reaction that is considered is 1@xmath9 production(0.15 gev for @xmath10 and 0.28 gev for @xmath11 ) , the cross section for which is studied by many authors .",
    "this channel very well dominates over all the other possible inelastic channels when free nucleon target is considered .",
    "however , when this channel is considered for bound nucleons , it has been found that due to renormalization of @xmath0 properties in the nuclear medium and the final state interaction(fsi ) of pions with the residual nucleus the cross section reduces considerably , and over all the reduction could be around 40 - 50@xmath12 in the energy region of @xmath131.2gev  @xcite .",
    "the hyperons produced in qe reaction also give rise to pions .",
    "the branching ratios are for @xmath14 . in the case of hyperon production , nuclear medium effects(nmes ) like fermi motion and pauli blocking have little effect on modifying the cross section from free nucleon case . however , the final state interaction of hyperons in the nucleus through charge exchange hyperon nucleon scattering results in an enhancement in the @xmath15 production(@xmath16 in @xmath17 ) , and reduction in the @xmath18 production(@xmath19 in @xmath17 ) .",
    "the decay width of pionic modes of hyperons is highly suppressed in the nuclear medium , making the hyperons live long enough to pass through the nucleus before decaying into pions .",
    "therefore , these pions are less affected by fsi of pions within the nuclear medium .",
    "experimentally , there is a possibility to study the polarization of hyperons at present facilities at fermilab  @xcite and j - parc  @xcite where high intensity beams of antineutrino are available .",
    "the experiments planned with liquid argon tpc ( lartpc ) detectors at microboone  @xcite and the proposed sbnd  @xcite and dune experiments  @xcite at fermilab will be able to see charged hadrons in coincidence , thus making it possible to measure polarization of hyperons by measuring the asymmetry in the angular distribution of decaying pions , in addition to the cross section measurements being done at miner@xmath20a  @xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , most appropriate time to theoretically perform the calculations for the polarization observables in the standard model using cabibbo theory and/or quark models , using the present state of knowledge about the symmetry of weak hadronic currents and the properties of transition form factors associated with the matrix element between the hadronic states .",
    "the study of single hyperon production(@xmath21 = 1 ) is interesting because    * they enable us to test the su(3 ) symmetry in our understanding of strangeness changing weak processes . *",
    "they provide an opportunity to measure n - y transition form factors which are presently known only at low @xmath22 from hyperon semileptonic decays(hsd ) . * precise predictions of @xmath23-a cross section in 0.3 gev - 1 gev energy region are possible .",
    "* polarization observables , like longitudinal ( @xmath24 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath25 ) components of polarization may give information independent of the cross section measurements on the axial dipole mass @xmath26 , electric neutron form factor @xmath27 and may be sensitive to pseudoscalar form factors . *",
    "polarization observable @xmath28 in a direction perpendicular to the reaction plane can be used to make studies of t  violation in high energy weak interactions .    in this paper , we have discussed antineutrino induced quasielastic charged current hyperon production on free and bound nucleons .",
    "y transition form factors are determined from the experimental data on quasielastic @xmath29 charged current ( anti)neutrino  nucleon scattering and the semileptonic decay of neutron and hyperons assuming g  invariance , t  invariance and su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "the vector transition form factors are obtained in terms of nucleon electromagnetic form factors .",
    "a dipole parameterization for the axial vector form factor and the pseudoscalar transition form factor derived in terms of axial vector form factor assuming pcac and gt relation extended to strangeness sector have been used in numerical evaluations .",
    "the nuclear medium effects(nme ) due to fermi motion and final state interaction(fsi ) effect due to hyperon - nucleon scattering have been taken into account .",
    "furthermore , we have also presented the results for longitudinal and perpendicular components of polarization of final hyperon(@xmath15,@xmath18 ) produced in the antineutrino induced quasielastic charged current reactions on nucleon targets .",
