    "a complete understanding of the physical processes underlying the transition between the high - temperature exponential relaxation of density fluctuations of a fluid and the non - exponential relaxational profiles observed at lower temperatures , especially near the glass transition , remains elusive .",
    "a number of interesting features have been noted in dense , supercooled systems from computer simulation studies@xcite as well as multi - dimensional nmr@xcite and video microscopy experiments@xcite that appear to be related to this cross - over from simple exponential to multi or stretched exponential relaxation : one typical feature of such systems is the appearance of heterogeneously - distributed regions of the fluid which differ dramatically in their mobility and local density .",
    "while fluid motions are relatively unrestricted in regions of low density , structural rearrangements in regions of high local density at a given time have been observed to occur through relatively rapid , collective string - like motions@xcite .",
    "furthermore , regions which at one time were of relatively low density and in which particle motions were primarily fluid - like can become locally - dense and immobile .",
    "it is well - known that a variety of different mechanisms are consistent with non - exponential relaxation and that this relaxation is somehow related to the heterogeneous nature of the dense fluid . in one possible scenario of non - exponential relaxation , fluctuations of local density relax in the same intrinsically non - exponential way , where the cooperative motion of particles depends strongly on the local environment and is correlated over a long time period or `` history '' .",
    "another possible mechanism is that each region of the fluid rearranges in a less strongly - correlated fashion but with different rates , so that the observed non - exponentiality is a consequence of the superposition of different exponential relaxation processes .",
    "of course neither scenario may apply over all time scales and the mechanism may shift from one that is primarily homogeneous to one that is primarily heterogeneous .",
    "it is equally possible that one type of relaxation may not even predominate over another .    in order to distinguish between these scenarios",
    "it is helpful to construct quantitative measures which unambiguously signal the presence of a specific mechanism .",
    "such constructions can be based on filters@xcite that select out sub - ensembles of particles to have specific dynamical properties over a sampling period .",
    "a simple example of such a filter is one that selects out individual particles that move either more or less than a critical distance over a fixed period of time .",
    "one can then examine time correlations within these sub - ensembles to gain new insight into detailed features of the dynamics .",
    "when time - filters are utilized in this fashion , time correlation functions of particles contained in the sub - ensemble necessarily involve multiple - time intervals .",
    "filters based on single - particle properties then can be expressed as multiple - time correlation functions of tagged particle densities .",
    "given this interesting application of multiple - time correlation functions , the need for a theory that enables one to calculate such quantities from first principles is clear . in ref .",
    "such a theory was developed based on mode - coupling theory for multiple - time correlation functions of collective densities ( i.e. , particle number , momentum and energy densities ) .",
    "the theory was tested successfully on a hard sphere gas at moderate densities in the hydrodynamic limit where the relevance of mode - coupling theory is well - established . in this article , the theory is extended to include multiple - time correlation functions of arbitrary type , encompassing correlation functions involving only tagged densities , only collective densities as well as any combination of the two types .    the paper is organized as follows : the mode - coupling formalism of multiple - time correlation functions is introduced in sec .",
    "[ formalism ] based on projection operator methods , and equations describing the evolution of multiple - point densities of arbitrary type are obtained .",
    "these equations are manipulated to yield expressions for correlation functions of multiple - time intervals that are local in all time arguments . in sec .",
    "[ norder ] , a systematic method of determining what types of contributions are the most significant for a particular multiple - time interval correlation function of tagged particle densities is introduced and the leading - order expressions for two and three - time interval correlations of a tagged particle density are presented . in sec .",
    "[ applications ] , specific applications of multiple - time correlation functions of tagged particle densities are examined . in particular , direct measures of relaxation type and of the rate at which solid - like domains become fluidized are analyzed and leading order mode - coupling expressions for these measures are obtained .",
    "[ applications ] concludes with a numerical comparison of the leading order theoretical predictions with direct simulation results for a low density , hard sphere system in the hydrodynamic limit and sec .",
    "[ summary ] contains a summary .",
    "the basic assumption of mode - coupling theory is that the long time behavior of all time correlations functions can be completely expressed in terms of the evolution of a set of slow modes of the system .",
    "although the theory does nt specify the identity of the slow modes , physical arguments can often serve as a guide to define a finite set of variables that serve as a dynamical basis for the long time evolution .",
    "for example , since the particle number , the momentum and the total energy of a fluid of structureless particles are constants of motion , a minimal basis set for the slow evolution of the system must include the long wavelength modes of densities of these quantities .",
    "once the slow basis set has been determined , the slow component of an arbitrary dynamical quantity can be extracted by finding the projection of the variable onto the subspace spanned by the set of slow variables .",
    "similarly , projecting the variable onto the complement of this subspace should yield a fast quantity .",
    "projection operators are linear operators , and hence only the linear dependence of a dynamical variable on the slow variables can be projected out by such a procedure . in general , however , one expects the time dependence of most dynamical variables to be a _ non - linear _ function of the slow variables .",
    "this non - linearity can be incorporated into the theory by constructing the slow subspace to include the space spanned by all powers of the slow variables . in this way",
    "an analytic dependence of the slowly - evolving component of a dynamical variable on the slow variables can be described .",
    "the basis of the slow subspace is referred to as the multi - linear basis .",
    "consider an equilibrium system composed of @xmath0 particles that is described by a translationally invariant hamiltonian @xmath1 .",
    "the time evolution of any quantity ( phase space function ) @xmath2 is given by @xmath3 with @xmath4 the liouvillian operator , which is the poisson bracket with the hamiltonian .",
    "to describe the slow evolution of dynamical variables within the projection operator formalism , the slow variables of the system are taken together in a single vector @xmath5 .",
    "as mentioned above , for a structureless fluid , these are typically the number density , the momentum density and the energy density : @xmath6 here , @xmath7 is the position of particle @xmath8 at time @xmath9 , @xmath10 is its momentum and @xmath11 its energy ( kinetic and potential )",
    ". it will be convenient to work in fourier space : @xmath12 where @xmath13 .",
    "since the goal of the mode - coupling theory outlined here is to describe the time correlation functions of single particles , slow tagged particle densities must be included , i.e. , @xmath14 where particle @xmath15 is the tagged particle . in the fourier representation ,",

    "_ densities ( which have no summation over particles in their definition ) and with a superscript @xmath21 when involving _ collective densities _",
    "( which have a summation over all particles in their definition ) .",
    "we require that the slow subspace be spanned by all powers of the slow variables .",
    "since the product @xmath22 is just a linear variable , beyond the linear level only products of @xmath5 are relevant",
    ". furthermore , to accommodate correlation functions of certain fast variables one might be interested in ( e.g. @xmath23 ) , @xmath24 is defined as the vector composed of all linear slow variables plus any fast variables of interest .",
    "it will prove to be convenient to construct a basis set that is orthogonal in the number of factors of the linear set @xmath19 and @xmath5 , which is guaranteed by the definition : @xmath25 here the following notation has been used :    * @xmath26 denotes the ( grand canonical ) equilibrium ensemble average , which is used to define the inner product . * a superscript `` @xmath27 '' defines complex conjugation . *",

    "* @xmath30 is the same as @xmath31 .",
    "also , in the rest of the paper , the short hand notation of a number @xmath8 instead of a greek letter will often be used to indicate a set of mode order is n. * the `` @xmath27''product involves a summation over the pairs of wave vectors and indices in @xmath29 , divided by all ways in which these pairs can be permuted , so as to avoid over - counting .",

    "this implies that @xmath45 and , more importantly , that the elements @xmath46 which have a @xmath47 component with zero wave vector have to be omitted from the set to avoid an over - complete basis .",

    "<S> this theory is used to derive for moderate densities the leading mode coupling expressions for indicators of relaxation type and domain relaxation , which use dynamical filters that lead to multiple - time correlations of a tagged particle density . </S>",
    "<S> the mode coupling expressions for higher order correlation functions are also succesfully tested against simulations of a hard sphere fluid at relatively low density . </S>"
