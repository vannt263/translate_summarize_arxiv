    "the development of efficient automated classification schemes is becoming of prime importance in astronomy .",
    "large surveys are monitoring millions , and soon billions , of targets .",
    "the resulting time series can not possibly be scrutinized by eye .",
    "the identification and study of variable stars require the use of powerful statistical and data mining tools .",
    "automated supervised classification methods provide object type predictions based on the values of a set of attributes characterizing the objects . in the first stage ,",
    "a collection of prototype objects of known type and attribute values , referred to as the training set , is used to build a model of the dependencies of the types on the attribute values . in the second stage , this model is used to predict the types of other objects of unknown types but with available attribute values .",
    "as the naming schemes differ in different publications , we make the following definitions to be used throughout this paper : _ objects _",
    "( i.e. , _ stars _ ) are classified into _",
    "types _ making use of a number of _",
    "tree - based classification methods are simple to use and popular in applications ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "they can deal with complex structures in the attribute space and have low systematic classification errors if the trees are sufficiently deep .",
    "however trees are noisy and the resulting type estimator has large variance . with the random forest method @xcite the variance is drastically reduced by averaging the results of many trees built from randomly selected subsamples of the training set ( bootstrapping ) .",
    "in addition , this method uses the best one of a number of randomly selected attributes at each branching , which has the effect of reducing the correlation between different trees and hence improving the averaging .",
    "the random method has been used in many scientific domains such as bioinformatics , biology , pharmacy and earth sciences , confirming that it performs excellently on a broad range of classification problems . by construction",
    "it is relatively robust against overfitting , it is only weakly sensitive to choices of tuning parameters , it can handle a large number of attributes , it provides an unbiased estimate of the generalization error , and the importance of each attribute can be estimated .",
    "a number of variable star classification studies exploit recent or ongoing surveys , such as ( 1 ) asas @xcite , ( 2 ) ogle @xcite , ( 3 ) macho @xcite . ( 4 ) corot @xcite , ( 5 ) kepler @xcite .",
    "a number of ambitious survey projects are also in an advanced stage of preparation , in particular , ( 1 ) pan - starrs , ( 2 ) lsst and ( 3 ) gaia .",
    "although these projects have different primary goals , the expected time series of measurements will provide data of unprecedented quality to study variable stars .",
    "these data are critical to both better characterize populations of variable stars in different environments and investigate in more depth typical or peculiar individual cases .",
    "progress in this field not only impacts our understanding of variable star physics , but also leads to contributions to a wide range of astronomical topics , from stellar evolution and population - synthesis modelling to distance scale related issues .",
    "the hipparcos mission stands out as a rather original and ambitious astrometry space programme .",
    "because of the whole sky repeated scanning , it provides accurate data for all the brightest stars in our close neighborhood .",
    "hipparcos_periodic star catalogueincludes most of the best studied stars and hence provides a unique set that can be used as a `` control sample '' .",
    "results obtained for these stars can be validated using the wealth of available published information .",
    "this is particularly useful for evaluating variable star classification methods before applying them to other large surveys .",
    "the variability types resulting from the classification can be compared with types available from the literature .",
    "hipparcos_sample also includes almost all types of variable stars present in the solar vicinity .",
    "it is certainly a solid basis for building a training sample for supervised classification methods .",
    "the comprehensive study of _",
    "hipparcos_variable stars presented in volume 11 of the _ hipparcos_periodic star catalogue @xcite does not comprise a systematic automated classification .",
    "the variability types provided in this catalogue are extracted from the literature with two exceptions .",
    "first , the eclipsing binaries and the rv tauri were identified and characterized on the basis of visual inspections of the folded light curves .",
    "second , a systematic classification of variables with b spectral type was achieved by @xcite using a multivariate discriminant analysis .",
    "later , @xcite used a similar technique to isolate variables with a2 to f8 spectral types . an attempt to obtain a systematic classification",
    "is also presented by @xcite .",
    "the subject of this paper is the development of the first systematic , fully automated classification of the complete sample of _",
    "hipparcos_periodic variable stars .",
    "the performance of the random forest method is evaluated and the results are compared with those obtained from the multistage classifier developed recently @xcite . in a companion paper @xcite , this work is extended to include non - periodic variables , both to study the classification of non - periodic stars and to evaluate the confusion between periodic and non - periodic types .",
    "the main goal is to fully validate our approach on a controlled sample of _",
    "hipparcos_stars , before applying it in a more automated fashion on other surveys in future studies .",
    "an important outcome of our work is a homogeneous supervised classification training set , which can be adapted to other missions , in particular , the upcoming gaia mission .",
    "predicted types are also provided for almost all _ hipparcos_periodic variables , including some that have no types or only uncertain ones in the literature .",
    "the procedure followed to build the training set from a sub - sample of the best - known _",
    "hipparcos_stars is described in sect .",
    "[ sect_ts ] .",

    "finally , our conclusions are given in the last section ( [ sect_conc ] ) .",
    "data from a set of objects of known types are needed to train the supervised classification algorithms .",
    "the quality of the classification directly rests on the reliability of the types of the stars included in this set , called the training set . for a given type",
    ", the selected objects should only include true representatives of the group with typical properties . in our case",
    ", we select a sub - set of our _ hipparcos_stars with most reliable types available from the literature , taking advantage of the fact that many of them are relatively bright , well studied objects .",
    "ideally , the relative frequencies of the different types in the training set should be representative of those in the population to - be - classified .",
    "a search for periods in the hipparcos data alone is inconclusive for 171 of the 2712 stars included in the _",

    "the period values published in the _",
    "hipparcos_periodic star cataloguecome from the literature for these stars .",
    "most of them are eclipsing binaries ( 152 eas ) with too few hipparcos measurements during the eclipses .",
    "these stars are excluded from the training set as the scope of this paper is restricted to periodic stars with a light curve from which it is possible , at least in principle , to infer a period .",
    "the variability types provided in the _",
    "hipparcos_periodic star cataloguewere mainly extracted from the literature ( to the notable exception of eclipsing binaries , see sect .",
    "[ sect_per_ecl ] ) available at the time of publication ( 1997 ) .",
    "these types are revised for our study using more recent information .",
    "the main reference is the international variable star index @xcite catalogue from the american association of variable star observers ( _ aavso_cataloguehereafter ) .",
    "this index includes information from the general catalogue of variable stars ( gcvs ) and the new catalogue of suspected variables ( nsv ) and it is kept up - to - date with the literature with 2 releases per month .",
    "the release adopted herein is that from june 13th , 2010 .",
    "information from private communications is preferentially used for some specific variability types ( see below ) as it is believed to be more reliable .",
    "the type - assignment process for _ hipparcos_variables is as follows ( see table  [ tab_ts ] for type acronym definitions ) :    1 .   for eclipsing binaries and ellipsoidal variables , the _ hipparcos_periodic star catalogueis taken as the reference as ( 1 ) the classification done at the time included reliable visual checking of the hipparcos light curves and ( 2 ) these light curves are known to have a good enough eclipse coverage to allow a successful period determination ( see above and sect .",
    "[ sect_per_ecl ] ) .",
    "hipparcos_stars of the types _ gdor _ , _ spb_and _ bcep_are provided by p. de cat and of _ lpv_by t. lebzelter , both maintain up - to - date compilations of literature information for these types .",
    "the type determination for _ acv_and _ sxari_stars that have a measured magnetic field are considered as particularly reliable . as a consequence , for these types , only the _ hipparcos_stars included in a list of magnetic stars provided by i.i .",
    "romanyuk ( private communication ) are retained .",
    "4 .   only the subset of _ hipparcos _  _ rs_and _ by_stars listed in the third edition of the `` catalogue of chromospherically active binary stars '' @xcite are included .",
    "all stars from the _",
    "aavso_cataloguewith a type matching any of the above mentioned types are excluded .",
    "for example , a star identified as mira , sr , lb or sarv in _",
    "aavso_cataloguethat is not in the lebzelter list of _",
    "lpv_is discarded from the training set .",
    "aavso_catalogueis then used to assign a type to the remaining stars from the _",
    "hipparcos_periodic star catalogue .",
    "this procedure leads to a subset of 1963 stars .",
    "a visual inspection of the folded light curves of all 1963 stars leads to the elimination of 64 stars due to either poor sampling or excessive noise .",
    "types with less than three representatives are discarded .",
    "this concerns 7 stars of six different types : fkcom , hads , insa , insb , nra , cw - fu in @xcite .",
    "finally , 92 stars with uncertain type ( denoted with a colon in the original sources ) are also excluded .",
    ".[tab_ts ] training set composition [ cols=\"<,<,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the comparison between the classification strategy described in sect .",
    "[ sect_rf ] and the multi - stage classifier is done following the same procedure @xcite used to select the best classifier in the nodes of the multi - stage tree .",
    "ten experiments of 10-fold cross validation are carried out .",
    "for each 10-fold cross validation experiment , the misclassification rate of the two alternative classifiers are subtracted .",
    "let @xmath0 denote the misclassification rate of one of the classifiers in the @xmath1-th run and @xmath2-th fold , and @xmath3 that of the alternative .",
    "then , the difference @xmath4 is calculated and the values of @xmath5 within the same run are sorted in increasing order . finally , the values of @xmath5 in each fold are averaged over the ten different runs .",
    "thus , this ends up with 10 sorted average misclassification rates and the corresponding variance estimates , one for each fold .",
    "then , the @xmath6 statistic is computed as follows    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the mean of the 100 misclassification rates , @xmath9 is the variance averaged over the 10 fold - wise variance estimates , and @xmath10 is the number of degrees of freedom . in our case , the calibration by @xcite ( i.e. , @xmath11 ) is used .",
    "it can be shown that the @xmath6 statistic follows a @xmath12 distribution for two classifiers that perform equally well ( the null hypothesis ) . in our case",
    ", a value of z=0.516 is obtained .",
    "it corresponds to a @xmath13-value of 0.31 which is clearly above any reasonable confidence threshold .",
    "therefore , there is no evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the two classification strategies ( the random forest and the multi - stage tree ) perform equally well .",
    "a complete set of attributes is available for 2543 stars out of the total of 2712 _ hipparcos_periodic variables . a sub - set of 1661 of these stars , selected following the procedure described in sect .",
    "[ sect_ts ] , forms the training set used in previous sections .",
    "there are 882 stars left , for which either only an uncertain type is available from the literature ( 832 ) , or no type at all can be found ( 50 ) .",
    "these stars are classified applying the best model obtained through the random forest processing of the training set .",
    "table  [ tab_training ] shows the literature types and the attribute values for the training - set sample , while table  [ tab_test ] shows the literature types ( when available ) , the predicted types and the attribute values for the 882 uncertain - type star sample .",
    "the predicted types are also compared to the literature types using a confusion - matrix type of display in fig .",
    "[ fig_cm_uncert_1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig_cm_uncert_2 ] .",
    "quite expectedly , the confusion is larger in these matrices , but the main confusion cases are the same as those observed with the training set ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_cm ] and the discussion of sect .",
    "[ sect_err_ana ] ) .",
    "note that only the sub - set of stars with available uncertain types from the literature is incorporated in these figures .",
    "the results presented in this paper show that it is possible to classify remarkably well the _ hipparcos_periodic variable stars into types that reflect their stellar physical properties . as detailed in sect .",
    "[ sect_err_ana ] , the main confusion cases are quite well understood .",
    "they originate from any of : ( 1 ) problems in extracting the correct period in the case of eclipsing binaries and _ ell_variables , ( 2 ) real similarities between different types of cepheid stars , ( 3 ) a known , true difficulty for disentangling different types of blue variables , in particular the _ spb_and _ acv_stars . in any case , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_cm ] the classification errors related to these confusion cases are generally below the 10% level .",
    "this figure also shows that they are only a handful of additional confusion cases .",
    "similarly good results are obtained with the random forest methodology as with the multi - stage approach .",
    "important advantages of random forest include a very useful attribute ranking method and a simple set - up and tuning .",
    "is it also surprisingly robust to the presence of irrelevant or highly correlated attributes .",
    "the multi - stage approach allows a controlled selection of a particular classification algorithm and of a different attribute set at each node .",
    "such choices can be useful in specific cases , but they also require more extensive and time - consuming optimization work .    experience with various classification methods , random forest , multi - stage and other alternative methods , suggest that significant improvements are unlikely to come from better classification algorithms .",
    "important progress rather can be expected through the introduction of new attributes which better reflect features of the physical processes responsible for the variability . they may even be specifically designed to disentangle some known cases of confusion .",
    "this is possible for example when additional independent data such as colour light curves , or radial - velocity time series are available .",
    "in addition to presenting the first systematic automated classification of the hipparcos periodic variable stars , this paper describes the construction of a homogeneous training set of periodic stars . in a companion paper ( rimoldini et al . in preparation ) , this training set is completed with non - periodic variable stars .",
    "the complete training set can then be adapted to other surveys as a starting point for further classification studies .",
    "some challenging topics , such as variability detection , period search reliability and possible confusion between periodic and non - periodic types are deferred to subsequent investigations .",
