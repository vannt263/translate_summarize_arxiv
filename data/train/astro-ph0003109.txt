    "galaxies do not live isolated lives , but exist in the tidal fields of their environment .",
    "arp ( 1966 ) , in his atlas of peculiar galaxies , lay the observational groundwork for the modern study of interacting galaxy systems by identifying many `` peculiar '' systems , later interpreted as various stages of major galaxy mergers .",

    "_ 1987 ; turner 1998 ; kennicutt 1998 ) , morphology ( e.g. toomre & toomre 1972 ; hernquist , heyl & spergel 1993 ) and kinematics of galaxies ( e.g. toomre & toomre 1972 ; barnes & hernquist 1992 ) driving evolution along the hubble sequence .",
    "massive mergers are also capable of funneling gas into the center of galaxies causing nuclear starbursts ( barnes & hernquist 1991 ; mihos , richstone & bothun 1992 ; barnes & hernquist 1996 ) and qso activity ( e.g. sanders _",
    "1988 ) . at the present epoch , however , major mergers are fairly rare events ( e.g. kennicutt _ et al .",
    "_ 1987 ) and their broad evolutionary importance is unclear .",
    "minor mergers and , in general , weak tidal interactions between galaxies occur with much higher frequency than major ones ( e.g. lacey & cole 1993 ) . by weak interactions we mean those which do not destroy the disk of the `` target '' spiral .",
    "hierarchical structure formation models ( e.g. cold dark matter ) predict that the merging histories for high mass objects today contained multiple low mass accretion events in their past ( e.g. lacey & cole 1993 ) . the specific roles which weak interactions play in the evolution of galaxies ,",
    "however , is uncertain .",
    "weak interactions may cause disk heating ( e.g. toth & ostriker 1992 ; quinn , hernquist & fullagar 1993 ) and satellite remnants may build up the stellar halo ( e.g. searle & zinn 1978 ; johnston , hernquist & bolte 1996 ) .",
    "( 1987 ) studied the relation between interaction strength and star formation by making a comparison between isolated galaxies , close pairs , and galaxies from the arp atlas .",
    "they found that close pairs have larger values of @xmath15 , i.e. higher star formation rates ( sfr ) than isolated galaxies .",
    "while pair spacing is weakly correlated with the sfr , they could not determine the specific role of interaction strength on the sfr .",
    "( 1998 ) and allam _",
    "( 1999 ) both studied the hubble type specific effects of environment on the sfr in galaxies .",
    "they found that the sfr/_mass of existing stars _ was inversely proportional to the local galaxy density .",
    "they postulate that the anti - correlation is due partly to gas stripping and due partly to the anti - correlation of the merger cross - section with the galaxy - galaxy velocity dispersion .",
    "there is also evidence that interactions excite nuclear activity . in their close pair and strongly interacting sample kennicutt _",
    "( 1987 ) found a strong correlation between @xmath16 emission in the disk and that in the nucleus .",
    "such a correlation between disk and nuclear emission is supported by theoretical work ; mihos & hernquist ( 1994 ) and hernquist & mihos ( 1995 ) demonstrated that minor interactions form bar instabilities in the disk which in turn funnel large amounts of gas into the nucleus .",
    "the effectiveness of this process is suppressed by the presence of a dense bulge , which prevents bar formation . due to the numerical expense in computing high resolution n - body / sph ( collisionless particle / smoothed particle hydrodynamics ) models ,",
    "the exact interaction parameters which result in such activity are uncertain .",
    "weak interactions may also manifest themselves as kinematic or structural irregularities .",
    "roughly @xmath17 of all spiral galaxies have asymmetric hi profiles and rotation curves ( baldwin , lynden - bell & sancisi 1980 ; richter & sancisi 1994 ; haynes _ et al .",
    "( 1980 ) postulated that these asymmetries are caused by weak interactions in the galaxy s past or by lopsided orbits .",
    "( 1999 ) examined the optical rotation curves of a set of observed and simulated interacting disk galaxies .",
    "they showed that interactions can cause large scale , time dependent asymmetries in the rotation curves of their sample galaxies .",
    "( 1999 ) studied the kinematic asymmetries present in two galaxies lopsided in their optical and hi distributions .",
    "they qualitatively reproduced the kinematic asymmetries by placing closed orbits in mildly lopsided potential .",
    "a dynamical indicator of weak interactions may be `` lopsidedness . '' in the context of this paper ( following rudnick & rix 1998 ; hereafter rr98 ) , lopsidedness is defined as a bulk asymmetry in the _ mass _ distribution of a galactic disk .",
    "surveys for lopsidedness in the stellar light of galaxies were first carried out by rix & zaritsky ( 1995 ; hereafter rz95 ) and zaritsky & rix ( 1997 ; hereafter zr97 ) . using near - ir surface photometry of face - on spiral galaxies ( spanning all hubble types ) they examined the magnitude of the @xmath2 azimuthal fourier component of the i and k - band surface brightness , thus characterizing the global asymmetry of the stellar light .",
    "rz95 and zr97 found that a quarter of the galaxies in their sample were significantly lopsided . using a larger , magnitude limited sample restricted to early type disks ( s0 to sab ) and imaged in the r - band , rr98 found that the fraction of significantly lopsided early type disks is identical to that for late - type disks .",
    "rr98 convincingly demonstrated that lopsidedness is not an effect of dust , but is in fact the asymmetric distribution of the light from old stars and hence from the _ stellar mass _ in the disk .",
    "some theoretical work has been done in examining long lived @xmath2 modes ( syer & tremaine 1996 ; zang & hohl 1978 ; sellwood & merritt 1994 ) , little convincing evidence however has been put forth to show that isolated galaxies will form stable @xmath2 modes without external perturbations or significant counter - rotating populations . without invoking the special cases above , long lived lopsidedness is possible if the disk resides in a lopsided potential .",
    "the question remains however : how is a lopsided potential created / maintained ?",
    "numerical simulations of hyperbolic encounters between disk galaxies fail to produce @xmath2 modes of amplitude @xmath18 without destroying the pre - existing stellar disk ( naab , t. ; private communication ) .",
    "minor mergers and possibly some weak interactions therefore remain as the most probable cause of lopsidedness ( rr98 ) .",
    "recent work has shown that perturbations in the outer halo of a galaxy may be amplified and even transmitted down into the disk ( weinberg 1994 ) .",
    "work by walker , mihos & hernquist ( 1996 ) and zr97 showed that the type and magnitude of lopsidedness seen in rz95 , zr97 and rr98 is comparable to the result of the accretion of a small satellite , if the mass ratio with the main galaxy is @xmath19 . in a preliminary study ( i.e. a rigid halo with no dynamical friction ) levine and sparke ( 1998 ) showed that lopsided galaxies may be formed by disks orbiting off center and retrograde in a flat - cored , dark matter dominated halo .",
    "they postulated that a galaxy may be pushed off center by a satellite accretion .    using phase mixing arguments ( baldwin _ et al . _ 1980 ; rz95 ) and analysis of n - body simulations ( walker _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ; zr97 ) the lifetime of lopsided features has been estimated at @xmath20 gyr . that lopsidedness is transient ( @xmath21 ) yet common",
    ", requires that it must be recurring and therefore lopsidedness may have significant evolutionary consequences .",
    "the current paper focuses on the impact that minor mergers ( observed as lopsidedness ) may have on boosting the sfr and the recent star formation history ( sfh ) of disk galaxies . for the purpose of this discussion",
    ", we will assume that lopsidedness is caused by minor mergers .",
    "regardless of what causes lopsidedness however , the perturbation in the gravitational potential manifestly exists and therefore may affect the gas in the galaxy to such a degree as to boost the sfr .",
    "indeed , zr97 find that lopsidedness is correlated ( at @xmath22 confidence ) with the `` excess '' of blue luminosity ( over what is predicted by the tully - fisher relation ) .",
    "modeling the integrated spectral evolution of starbursts using evolutionary population synthesis ( eps ) codes has been been well studied ( e.g. couch and sharples 1987 ; barger _",
    "_ 1996 ; turner 1998 ) and despite its limitations , is a useful tool in determining the relative sfh over the past @xmath23 gyr .",
    "the same techniques used to probe the sfh in massive starbursts should also work to probe the recent sfh in the putative mini - bursts which we seek to study . by comparing measured indicators of recent sf ( e.g. @xmath4 , @xmath3 break strength , a star content ) , to the same indicators derived from the eps models",
    ", we will place limits on the mini - burst mass and duration .",
    "we have obtained spatially integrated spectra of a sample of 40 late type spiral galaxies ( sab - sbc ) of varying degrees of lopsidedness with the intent of using their relative stellar populations ( as determined from stellar template fitting and eps models ) to determine their recent sf histories . unlike the mass - normalized blue light excess , @xmath24 used in zr97 , our method operates independently of assumptions about a galaxy s mass , inclination or luminosity .",
    "in addition to probing the recent ( @xmath25 gyr ) sfh with studies of the stellar continuum we probe the current sfr by measuring the integrated balmer line emission strengths ( e.g. kennicutt _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ) .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we discuss the sample selection , observations , data reduction and determination of galaxy lopsidedness ; in  3 we examine our methods for determining the current sfr and recent sfh via the measurement of emission and stellar continuum properties as a function of lopsidedness .",
    "the discussion of the significance of these results , including the correlation of the boost parameters with other galaxy characteristics and the impact of our results on previous works ( i.e. rz95,zr97 & rr98 ) is contained in  4 . in  5 we present a summary and possible directions for future work .",
    "to build a sample of galaxies with varying degrees of lopsidedness , we imaged a large number of galaxies ( @xmath26 ) taken from the rc3 catalog ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ) , selected according to the following criteria : apparent blue magnitude m@xmath2714 , redshift cz@xmath2810,000 km / s , axis ratio @xmath290.64 ( @xmath30 ) , de vaucouleurs type @xmath31 , and a maximum diameter of 4@xmath32 .",
    "the median diameter of the galaxies in our sample was 1.8@xmath32 .",
    "the magnitude and redshift limits were chosen to minimize the required exposure times .",
    "the axis ratio of the galaxies was constrained because it is hard to measure an azimuthal @xmath2 component in a highly inclined galaxy .",
    "once imaging was obtained and lopsidedness determined for each galaxy ( see  _ 2.2.1 _ ) , we constructed a sample for spectroscopy consisting of 40 of our imaged galaxies ( see table 1 ) .",
    "these were selected to give the sample equal numbers of lopsided and symmetric targets .",
    "our sample is partially selected according to hubble type , and we must explore the effects which morphological evolution induced by lopsidedness may have on our conclusions . walker _",
    "( 1996 ) suggested that minor mergers increase bulge size , heat the galactic disk vertically and consume a large fraction of the galaxy s gas , eventually resulting in a low post - merger sfr .",
    "these two effects may drive galaxies towards earlier hubble type after they experience minor mergers .",
    "evolutionary processes such as these however become dominant either after the expected lifetime of lopsidedness ( @xmath33 gyr ) , or after repeated merger events ( walker _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) . during the interaction itself",
    "the irregularity in structure made manifest by lopsidedness as well as the creation of spiral arms via tidal perturbations will temporarily move a galaxy later in hubble type .",
    "this will effectively push lopsided early type disk galaxies into our sample while pushing those of later type out of it . due to their lower gas masses ( roberts & haynes 1994 ) ,",
    "early type spirals have less potential for a large absolute increase in their sfr than late types .",
    "small boosts , however , may be easily noticeable against the typically older stellar population of early type disks .",
    "the exact interplay of these two effects may bias our measurement of the relation between sfr and lopsidedness .",
    "our imaging data were obtained during runs at steward observatory s 2.3-m bok reflector on kitt peak ( 1997",
    "november 6 - 7 and 1998 february 1 - 2 ) and at its 61-inch ( 1.5-m ) reflector on mt .",
    "bigelow ( 1998 may 15 - 18 ) .",
    "the ccd pixel scales at the bok reflector and bigelow reflector were @xmath34 with fields of view @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively .",
    "the median seeing at the 2.3-m for the november and february runs were 13 and 15 , respectively , while the median seeing at the 1.5-m in may was 13 .    a nearly - mould @xmath37band filter ( @xmath38 ) was used at the 2.3-m and a kron - cousins r - band filter with @xmath38 was used at the 1.5-m .",
    "the effects of wavelength on observed lopsidedness are discussed in  2.1 of rr98 , and found not to be critical .    to determine the lopsidedness of a galaxy we perform an azimuthal fourier decomposition of the r - band surface brightness , as in rr98 : @xmath39 } \\},\\ ] ] where for each radius , @xmath40 is the average intensity and @xmath41 describes the lopsidedness .",
    "we define the luminosity normalized quantities @xmath42 . instead of @xmath43",
    ", we use @xmath44 ( the error corrected value which accounts for the positive definite nature of our measurements and the presence of errors ; see rr98 for details ) as our measure of asymmetry .",
    "we calculate the mean asymmetry of each galaxy , @xmath1 ( see table 2 ) , from 1.5 to 2.5 disk scale lengths using the weighted average described in rr98 .",
    "spectra were obtained with the bollers & chivens spectrograph at the 2.3-m bok reflector during the nights , 1998 march 22 - 25 , 1998 may 25 - 28 , and 1998 june 29 .",
    "we used a @xmath45 in @xmath46 order , blazed at @xmath47 , and a @xmath48 slit , resulting in a resolution of  @xmath49 and a wavelength range of @xmath50 .",
    "this range includes the entire balmer series redward to @xmath51 , the @xmath3 break , ca h+k doublet , [ ] @xmath52 and [ ] @xmath53 .",
    "to reduce read noise , the ccd was binned in the spatial direction ; on 22 march we binned by 2 for a resultant pixel scale of @xmath54 while on all other nights we binned by 4 for a pixel scale of @xmath55 .",
    "a cuso@xmath56 filter was used to block @xmath57 order light . aside from using standard stars to calibrate the relative spectral response of the instrument , no absolute flux calibration was attempted .",
    "this was done partly because of the non - photometric conditions of some of our nights and partly due to the independence of our analysis methods on absolute flux levels .",
    "following kennicutt ( 1992 ) , we obtained spatially integrated spectra of the galaxies by repeatedly scanning the slit across the galaxy between @xmath58 .",
    "for each galaxy we obtained 2 exposures of 25 minutes each . to isolate the disk contributions to the integrated spectra , we also obtained a 5 minute exposure of the nucleus for each galaxy for later subtraction .",
    "the basic image reduction was carried out with standard iraf routines .",
    "the total dark current was @xmath59 and so it was ignored .",
    "the images were flat - fielded with a combination of twilight and smoothed night sky flats .",
    "high @xmath60 twilight flats ( @xmath61 ) were used to take out small - scale variations and the lower @xmath60 smoothed night sky flats ( @xmath62 ) were used to take out large - scale sensitivity fluctuations .",
    "the large - scale flat - field quality was determined by measuring variance in the median sky level at the four corners of the images . in all images where the galaxy was small in the field of view",
    ", the images were found to be flattened to better than @xmath63 . in some cases , the large size of the galaxies in comparison to the field of view at the 1.5-m telescope precluded such an estimate .",
    "point sources in the images were selected using daofind , and surrounding pixels were excised in the subsequent analysis to a radius where the stellar point spread function declined to the level of the sky .",
    "the basic spectral reduction was carried out with iraf routines .",
    "the measured dark current from multiple 25 minute dark exposures was @xmath64 and so was not accounted for .",
    "small - scale variations were removed with a combined series of 2 min .",
    "dome flats .",
    "twilight flats were fit in the spatial direction with a @xmath65 order cubic spline at several different positions in the spectral direction to construct a map of the slit response as a function of wavelength .",
    "non - linear pixels were interpolated over using a bad pixel mask generated from the ratio between a combined series of 2 minute and 10 second dome flats .",
    "removing cosmic rays from spectra without accidently removing emission lines is best automated by using the shape of the spectrum itself in the cleaning process : for a given column ( spatial direction ) , we medianed together the target column with the eight columns on either side to construct a slit profile , @xmath66 . using @xmath67 minimization",
    ", we fit the target column with the the following function : @xmath68 where the @xmath69 term accounts for the sky background .",
    "pixels deviating by more than 7 @xmath70 from the best fit are replaced with the value of the best fit model at that point . flagged segments larger than the spectral resolution of the instrument",
    "were not removed so as to avoid the accidental cleaning of emission lines .",
    "this algorithm is very efficient and , once a suitable set of parameters ( i.e. @xmath71 , threshold ) has been chosen , can remove almost all of the cosmic rays on the chip .",
    "after cosmic ray removal , the spectra were rectified using he - ar lamps taken at various times during the night .",
    "background contributions were then subtracted . to extract the spectra",
    ", we summed the number of center rows which corresponded to @xmath72 for the disk spectra and extracted the center row only for the nuclear spectra . using standard stars taken during the night",
    ", we then removed the spectral response of the system from the 1d , extracted spectra .",
    "finally , the wavelength scale of each spectra was shifted to the rest frame of the galaxy .",
    "the guided nuclear exposures were scaled by the effective exposure times on the nucleus during the drift scanning .",
    "these scaled exposures were then subtracted from the drift spectra . in this way , we separated the disk and nuclear contributions .",
    "finally , all spectra were scaled to their median flux level .",
    "the error calculation for @xmath14 is described in rr98 ; it accounts for both photon statistics and systematic flat - fielding uncertainties .",
    "using poisson statistics to describe the error in a raw spectrum we created an `` error spectrum '' and performed on it all of the standard reduction steps discussed in  2.3.2 except for the cosmic ray cleaning .",
    "after normalizing the `` science spectra , '' the `` error spectra '' were scaled by the median of the `` science spectra '' to form a detailed representation of the error at each pixel .",
    "the `` error spectra '' were used in all of the following analysis steps .",
    "by examining spatially integrated spectral characteristics as a function of @xmath14 , we can determine whether lopsidedness affects the sf histories of galaxies .",
    "it is difficult , even in major mergers , to invert optical spectrophotometry into a sfh estimate ( e.g. turner 1998 ) .",
    "however , the relative strength of the current and recent sfr in different galaxies may be studied with moderate @xmath60 , non flux - calibrated spectra ( e.g. couch & sharples 1987 ; barger _",
    "the equivalent width of @xmath16 in emission ( @xmath15 ) integrated over the whole disk is a robust measure of the current global sfr in terms of the previously formed stars ( kennicutt et al .",
    "much of the balmer emission inn a galactic disk comes from the hii regions seen in sfr regions . in this regime",
    ", the balmer decrement relates the emission flux in @xmath51 to that in @xmath16 .",
    "if the continuum level at these two wavelengths is similar , then the decrement will also relate the @xmath73 of the two lines .",
    "therefore , the absorption corrected @xmath74 ( see  3.2 ) serves as an indirect indicator of the current sfr in the disk .",
    "the likely lifetime of lopsidedness has been estimated as @xmath20 gyr ( baldwin _ et al . _ 1980 ; rz95 ; zr97 ) . to examine sf on these timescales ,",
    "we need a sf tracer with a comparable lifetime .",
    "main sequence a - stars have lifetimes of @xmath75 gyr ( clayton 1983 ) , have strong spectral signatures ( e.g. strong balmer lines , a blue continuum , and a weak @xmath3 break ) , and so serve as appropriate probes of the recent sfh .",
    "fitting population synthesis models ( e.g. bruzual & charlot 1993 ) to our spectra can give us a measure of the recent sfh .",
    "however for four reasons we choose to simply fit with empirical stellar templates ( jacoby _ et al .",
    "_ 1984 ) : 1 ) the spectral resolution of available population synthesis models ( @xmath76 ) is significantly less than that of our spectra ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "2 ) the empirical templates of jacoby _ et al . _",
    "( 1984 ) have a spectral resolution ( @xmath78 ) slightly less than that of our spectra .",
    "3 ) an adequate fit to the spectra can be obtained with a small number of high s / n stellar templates . to estimate the recent , relative sfh , we therefore need not deal with the complexities of the imf and metallicity of the stellar populations .    as a qualitative measure of the relative contributions to our spectra from young and old stars ,",
    "we synthesize the global absorption spectra of the galaxies in our sample with a linear combination of two stellar templates , an a0v and a g0iii spectra from the jacoby _",
    "( 1984 ) stellar library .",
    "we also individually fit and subtract a @xmath79 order polynomial of zero mean from the spectra and from each stellar template to correct for color terms ( e.g. from calibration errors , from approximating the spectra with only two stellar templates ) .",
    "the spectra ( with the polynomial subtracted ) are fit by @xmath67 minimization with the following model:@xmath80 where @xmath81 and the weights , c were determined iteratively . @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the weights for the normalized stellar template spectra , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "@xmath86 is the sum of the weighted template polynomial components , @xmath81 represents the doppler broadening of the stars which is convolved with the stellar templates , and @xmath87 is the convolution operator . for more details on the fitting procedure",
    "( 1995 ) and turner ( 1998 ) .",
    "independent of continuum slope , there is a unique set of line shapes and strengths for stars of each spectral type .",
    "the polynomial fit minimizes the effects of a global continuum slope on our best fit solution so that we are instead performing a global fit to the spectral features ( @xmath3 break , ca h@xmath88k , balmer series , etc . )",
    "we find that with only two , polynomial subtracted , stellar templates , we are able to consistently achieve fits with @xmath89 .",
    "our template fit to the galaxy spectra should reflect only the stellar populations in the galaxy , not interstellar emission .",
    "therefore , we first fit all portions of spectra , omitting expected emission regions , and use the residual of the best model fit to construct an emission spectrum . we remove the large scale variations in the residual by fitting it with a high order polynomial ( @xmath90 ) at all locations where no emission is expected .",
    "we then fit each emission feature with a gaussian . to isolate the stellar continuum",
    ", we subtract these gaussian components from the original spectra .",
    "we then re - fit our @xmath91 to this cleaned , pure absorption spectrum to determine @xmath92 .",
    "this process is illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "we measure @xmath74 ( see table 2 ) from the complementary absorption corrected emission line spectra for all of our galaxies .",
    "a linear continuum was fit on either side of @xmath51 ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "we then measured the equivalent width of the emission line integrating from @xmath94 .",
    "the boundaries of our integration were chosen by visual inspection to minimize noise contributions from the continuum while maximizing the amount of line flux .",
    "we can quantify the relative a star abundances by simply using the value of @xmath82 ( see table 2 ) in @xmath92 . because the basis templates are normalized to their median fluxes ( as are the data , ) the scaling factor of the individual templates gives a measure of how much a - stars contribute to the integrated spectra .",
    "balmer absorption lines are strongest in a - stars , the @xmath3 break is weak , and so we may also use these two features to measure the recent sfh ( couch & sharples 1987 ; barger _",
    "we use the equivalent width of @xmath95 in absorption ( @xmath4 ) as our indicator of balmer line strength in order to minimize emission contamination and sample a relatively isolated region of the spectrum .",
    "a linear continuum was fit on either side of @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "we measure the @xmath97 itself from @xmath98 .    instead of measuring @xmath4 directly from the spectrum , we decide to measure @xmath99 ( see table 2 ) of the best matching template spectrum , @xmath92 .",
    "these template spectra are in general a good match to the data and provide an essentially noiseless estimate of @xmath4 with a value derived from the best fit to a broad wavelength range .",
    "when measuring @xmath4 directly from the spectra , the relation between @xmath4 and @xmath100 ( see  4.3 ) clearly remains , but the scatter in @xmath4 at a given @xmath100 is slightly larger .    to further parameterize the recent sfh , we use the strength of the @xmath3 break ( @xmath5 ) ( see table 2 ) .",
    "our measure of the break strength is defined as : @xmath101 the suppression of the continuum blueward of @xmath102 manifested in the break is caused by the combined absorption from the ca h@xmath88k and @xmath103 absorption line .",
    "as young , massive stars ( with blue continua and weak metal lines ) contribute more to the overall spectrum , @xmath5 decreases .",
    "to examine qualitatively the link between lopsidedness and sfr , we constructed composite disk spectra from the median of our nine most symmetric and nine most lopsided galaxies , and these we show in figure 2 .",
    "the lopsided composite spectrum has a much bluer continuum , stronger balmer lines , stronger emission and a shallower @xmath3 break than its symmetric counterpart regardless of exactly how many galaxies we include in the median spectrum .",
    "this result indicates that lopsidedness is in fact correlated with the recent sfh .",
    "however , a quantitative treatment of the relation is still needed .",
    "figure 3 shows the relation between @xmath74 and @xmath104 for the entire spectroscopic sample . using a spearman - rank test , we find that the distribution of @xmath74 vs. @xmath100 deviates from a random one at the @xmath105 level .",
    "the median @xmath74 of our nine most symmetric galaxies is @xmath106 while the median for our nine most lopsided galaxies is @xmath107 .",
    "the correlation of @xmath74 , and hence the current sfr , with @xmath14 is clearly shown in fig .",
    "this implies that an elevation in the instantaneous sfr occurs over the same timescales as lopsidedness , lasting maybe as long as @xmath23 gyr after the onset of lopsidedness .",
    "figure 4 shows the relation of a - star content , @xmath99 , and @xmath5 with @xmath108 .",
    "they deviate from random distributions at the @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 levels respectively .",
    "our sample is not large enough to study these correlations separately for different hubble types ; instead we analyze the change in spectral properties of the sample as a whole .",
    "figure 5 shows that the data are differentiated by lopsidedness in the @xmath99 vs. @xmath5 plane .",
    "the large scatter is not surprising , as even within a single hubble type there is a considerable variation in the specific sfhs ( kennicutt _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ) . between the most lopsided and symmetric @xmath112 of our galaxies the median values of @xmath99 and @xmath5 differ by , @xmath113 and @xmath114 , respectively .",
    "this defines a boost vector ( fig .",
    "5 ) whose direction and magnitude characterize the difference in spectral indices between a symmetric and lopsided galaxy in our sample .",
    "a number of efforts have shown that the detailed sfh , even over the last @xmath115 years , can not be determined unambiguously from integrated spectra ( e.g. turner 1998 and references therein ; leonardi & rose 1996 ) .",
    "instead , we restrict ourselves to a set of model sfhs consisting of a `` normal '' or `` underlying '' spiral galaxy sfh , which in lopsided galaxies has been boosted in the past by a factor @xmath116 .",
    "we then attempt to characterize the boost strength , @xmath116 , and an associated timescale . using the eps code of bruzual & charlot , ( gissel 1995",
    "; in preparation ) we construct seds representing the light from the underlying stellar populations of galaxies in our sample .",
    "we specify the sfh by the birthrate parameter @xmath117 ( scalo 1986 ) , where @xmath118 assuming an exponential sfh , i.e. @xmath119 $ ] , each @xmath117 has an associated timescale , @xmath120 defined through @xmath121 -1 = \\frac{t_{gal}}{\\tau(b ) } \\frac{1}{b},\\ ] ] with @xmath122 as the age of the galaxy .",
    "we adopt an age of @xmath123 gyr and a metallicity of @xmath124 .",
    "we also use the salpeter ( 1955 ) imf with a mass range of @xmath125 .",
    "this imf provides a better fit than does the scalo imf ( 1986 ) to the global photoionization rates and to the colors of galactic disks ( kennicutt et al .",
    "1994 ) . applying the scalo imf results in slightly lower fractional boost masses than the salpeter imf , but the imf choice does not qualitatively affect our conclusions .",
    "the model sed is then given by the integral : @xmath126 where @xmath127,\\ ] ] where @xmath128 is the hubble type dependent initial sfr of the galaxy used to normalize the present day masses to the same value , and where @xmath129 is the sed for a population @xmath130 years after a delta function burst ( bruzual & charlot s simple starburst model ) .",
    "we account for the change in the spectral properties by _ adding _ an exponentially declining increase , or `` boost '' in sf on top of the underlying galactic sfh .",
    "we assume that the boost originated about @xmath131 years ago , comparable to the presumed dynamical age of the boost and the a - stars seen in figure 2 .",
    "the model sed for a galaxy with a boost population is given by : @xmath132 dt ' + \\int^{t_{boost}}_{0 } s(t',\\lambda ) c_{boost } \\exp \\left [ -\\frac{t'}{\\tau_{boost } } \\right ] dt'\\ ] ] .    for each hubble type ,",
    "i.e. for each @xmath120 we construct model tracks by varying @xmath116 and @xmath133 in equation ( 9 ) , effectively adding differing boosts to the unperturbed galaxy sfh . as shown in fig .",
    "6 , moving the underlying population later in hubble type , or to a larger @xmath120 , shifts the tracks to greater values of @xmath99 and smaller values of @xmath5 . for a given hubble type , varying the boost timescale changes the slope of the track of increasing boost mass .",
    "it is interesting to note that our empirical boost vector can not be matched directly with any of the models in the @xmath99 vs. @xmath5 plane , suggesting that the eps models may have systematic errors .",
    "assuming , however , that the correct models will differ from these by a simple shift in the @xmath99 vs. @xmath5 plane , we choose the underlying population model which minimizes the distance ( in the @xmath99 vs. @xmath5 plane ) to the beginning of our observed boost vector .",
    "we then match the slope of the boost vector by varying the boost timescale .",
    "the best match we find was for @xmath134 ( hubble type sb ; kennicutt et al .",
    "1994 ) and @xmath135 myr . for reference",
    ", we also show the tracks for underlying galaxy spectra with @xmath117 parameters corresponding to hubble types of sab and sbc ( @xmath136 and @xmath137 respectively ; kennicutt et al .",
    "for each of these hubble types , we plot tracks corresponding to boosts with @xmath138 myr and @xmath135 myr .",
    "we also plot the @xmath138 myr boost for the @xmath134 model .",
    "measuring the projected length of the boost vector on the best model , and assuming the galaxy disk has a final stellar mass of @xmath139 , we find that @xmath10 of stars have been formed over the the past @xmath9 gyr in addition to the `` underlying '' sfh .",
    "this corresponds to an factor of @xmath140 increase in the sfr over the past @xmath141 years .",
    "extinction will have two primary effects on our data .",
    "it will redden the continuum from the galaxy . by allowing for a polynomial element to our template",
    "fits , we minimize the effect of the continuum slope on our results .",
    "extinction may also affect regions of current sf ; obscuring both emission lines and the continuum from massive young stars .",
    "we do not make a further account of reddening but acknowledge that our boost masses may increase if reddening is included .",
    "it is important to verify that our result is not an artifact of correlations between the underlying sfh and lopsidedness . to determine whether mass , gas content or hubble type effects mimic our relation between lopsidedness and sfr , we examined the distributions of @xmath74 , @xmath99 , @xmath5 , a star content and @xmath14 vs. @xmath142 , @xmath143 and t - type ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "a hidden correlation exists if any of the latter three parameters are correlated both with a sf indicator and with @xmath14 .",
    "none of the above distributions , except for @xmath74 and @xmath5 vs. t - type and @xmath143 , have more than a @xmath144 probability of being correlated , with a @xmath145 significance for the four remaining correlations .",
    "given the known correspondence between sfr and hubble type , mean stellar population and hubble type , and sfr and gas surface density ( kennicutt et al .",
    "1994 ) , these correlations with @xmath74 and @xmath5 are expected . however ,",
    "none of our canonical galaxy parameters show a correlation with lopsidedness at above the @xmath146 level and we can therefore be confident that we are seeing a true correlation between our sf indicators and @xmath147 .      as an initial diagnostic of the nuclear contributions ,",
    "we examine the fraction of galactic light originating in the nucleus . even without absolute spectrophotometry",
    ", we can still examine what percentage of the total galaxy light is made up of light from the nucleus as long as the spectra are calibrated with respect to each other .",
    "the fractional luminosity of the nucleus ranged from @xmath148 with a median value of @xmath149 .",
    "the fractional luminosity of the nucleus is uncorrelated with @xmath150 .",
    "a spearman - rank test showed that there was a @xmath151 probability that the data was drawn from a random sample .",
    "figure 7 shows that while the nuclear @xmath74 vs. @xmath150 , and @xmath99 vs. @xmath150 are correlated , the relations show more scatter than in the disk .",
    "the spearman - rank test shows that these two relations are less significantly correlated in the nucleus than in the disk by @xmath152 and @xmath153 , respectively . only for @xmath5",
    "vs. @xmath150 was the correlation greater than in the disk .",
    "our data indicate that the enhanced sf in lopsided galaxies occurs in the disk with equal or greater strength than in the nucleus .",
    "this result appears to run contrary to what numerical simulations suggest about the reactions of gas in the disk to tidal perturbations from external sources .",
    "mihos & hernquist ( 1994 ) and hernquist & mihos ( 1995 ) show that even high mass ratio mergers ( @xmath154 ) can form a bar which torques gas in the disk and funnels much of it into the nucleus .",
    "however the presence of a dense bulge easily inhibits bar formation and hence gas is not funneled as effectively .",
    "another explanation is that star formation is occurring in large amounts at the nucleus , but is partly masked by extinction .",
    "high extinction is often found to be coincident with high star formation regions in mergers and is easily capable of hiding the presence of young populations ( turner 1998 ) .      to estimate the volume density of lopsided galaxies from a magnitude limited sample",
    "requires the understanding of any systematic differences in luminosity between lopsided and symmetric galaxies ( zr97 ) .",
    "our best fit boost brightens the galaxies by 1.3 , 1.0 and 0.8 magnitudes ( in b , v , and r , respectively ) over the brightness of the underlying population .",
    "lopsided galaxies will hence be overrepresented in our b - band selected sample , and their volume density will be @xmath155 of that derived from any magnitude limited survey . to compare the frequency of lopsidedness for different hubble types ( e.g. rr98 ) , we need to understand how this brightening depends on the `` underlying '' sfh . unfortunately , we have too few galaxies in our sample to discuss hubble type dependent effects on the boost strength and luminosity evolution .    at present , the main constraint on the frequency of lopsidedness is from its frequency in imaging samples ( @xmath156 ; rr98 ) . coupled with our brightening estimates , we find that @xmath157 of the galaxies in a volume limited sample will be lopsided .",
    "lopsidedness is likely caused by minor mergers , the frequency of which increases with look back time .",
    "given that lopsidedness lasts for @xmath158 gyr , we can estimate that the average galaxy has been lopsided at least once in its lifetime .",
    "to quantify the correlation between the recent sf histories of present - day spiral galaxies and their global asymmetry , we compare the integrated spectral properties of late - type spirals of varying lopsidedness .",
    "we find that the recent ( @xmath159 gyr ) sfh and current ( @xmath160 years ) sfr are both strongly correlated with @xmath150 although there is appreciable scatter in the individual galaxy - to - galaxy properties . for @xmath74 , reflecting the current sfr , we find a @xmath7 spearman - rank correlation with @xmath150 .",
    "we fit a combination of a0v and g0iii stellar spectra to our galaxy spectra to quantify the relative abundance of a - stars in the disk ( which traces the sfr within 0.5 gyrs ) . from these best fit model spectra , @xmath92",
    ", we measure a number of spectral indices , and find that @xmath99 , @xmath5 , and @xmath82 are correlated with @xmath150 at the @xmath161 , @xmath162 , and @xmath163 levels , respectively .",
    "we measure the same spectral indices in the nucleus , and find them less correlated with @xmath150 ( except @xmath5 ) .",
    "unless a nuclear starburst is obscured , the disk and not the nucleus is the primary site of the sf increase we see in lopsided galaxies .",
    "this is in contrast to numerical simulations where minor mergers funnel gas into the nucleus of galaxies , causing intense starbursts ( mihos & hernquist 1994 ; hernquist & mihos 1995 ) . only by the presence of a dense bulge",
    "can the formation of a bar , and the subsequent funneling of gas , be prevented .    to quantify the mass of additional stars formed in lopsided galaxies , we defined a boost vector in @xmath99 vs. @xmath5 space , by comparing the median values of these properties for the most symmetric third and the most lopsided third of our sample .",
    "we find @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "we fit this vector with an `` underlying population @xmath88 boost '' eps model corresponding to a progenitor galaxy with @xmath134 , @xmath135 myr , and boost age of @xmath9 gyr . using this best fit eps model , we find that @xmath10 is formed in the boost in addition to the `` underlying '' sfh ( assuming a final stellar mass of @xmath166 ) . this is a considerable fraction ( @xmath167 ) of the final stellar mass of the galaxy and corresponds to a factor of 8 increase in the sfr over the past @xmath13 years . given the increasing merger rates and increasing gas fractions towards higher redshifts , minor merger induced sf boosts of short duration played an important role in assembling the present day stellar content of galaxies .",
    "finally , we address by how much the frequency of lopsidedness from a magnitude limited sample is increased by the corresponding luminosity boost .",
    "our best fit eps boost model corresponds to a @xmath158 magnitude brightening when galaxies becomes lopsided , increasing their presence four - fold in magnitude limited samples .",
    "we lack the statistics however , to examine any hubble type dependent differences in the luminosity boost .",
    "it is obvious that more work needs to be done to fully understand the cause of lopsidedness as well as the sfh of lopsided galaxies . to quantify the hubble type specific boost in the recent sfh",
    ", a large sample should be obtained with significant numbers of galaxies in each hubble type bin . since imaging and spectroscopy will be needed for this project , a volume limited sample may be constructed which bypasses many of the problems encountered when selecting galaxies according to an apparent magnitude limit .",
    "companion searches to sufficiently faint magnitudes will help to study the possible link between environment and lopsidedness ( as caused by weak tidal interactions ) . with the recent commissioning of large area imaging and spectroscopy surveys such as sloan digital sky survey , constructing such a sample",
    "will become relatively straightforward .",
    "numerical simulations have shown to be a useful tool in studying the evolution of the stellar and gas distributions in minor mergers .",
    "high resolution simulations with a live halo are crucial for studying the detailed response of the disk to the merger ( walker _ et al .",
    "a thorough exploration of interaction parameter space is needed to quantify the structural and kinematic response in the stellar and gas components .",
    "high resolution n - body studies are also needed to explore the global stability of isolated galactic disks .",

    "<S> to investigate the link between weak tidal interactions in disk galaxies and the boosting of their recent star formation , we obtain images and spatially integrated spectra ( @xmath0 ) for 40 late - type spiral galaxies ( sab - sbc ) with varying degrees of lopsidedness ( a dynamical indicator of weak interactions ) . </S>",
    "<S> we quantify lopsidedness as the amplitude @xmath1 , of the @xmath2 fourier component of the azimuthal surface brightness distribution , averaged over a range of radii . </S>",
    "<S> the median spectrum of the most lopsided galaxies shows strong evidence for a more prominent young stellar population ( i.e. strong balmer absorption , strong nebular emission , a weak @xmath3 break and a blue continuum ) when compared to the median spectrum of the most symmetric galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the young stellar content , quantified by @xmath4 and the strength of the @xmath3 break ( @xmath5 ) , with lopsidedness and find a @xmath6 correlation between the two . </S>",
    "<S> we also find a @xmath7 correlation between @xmath8 and lopsidedness . </S>",
    "<S> using the evolutionary population synthesis code of bruzual & charlot we model the spectra as an `` underlying population '' and a superimposed `` boost population '' with the aim of constraining the fractional boost in the sfr averaged over the past @xmath9 gyr ( the characteristic lifetime of lopsidedness ) . from the difference in both @xmath4 and the strength of the @xmath3 break ( @xmath5 ) between the most and least symmetric thirds of our sample </S>",
    "<S> , we infer that @xmath10 of stars are formed over the duration of a lopsided event in addition to the `` underlying '' sfh ( assuming a final galactic stellar mass of @xmath11 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to a factor of @xmath12 increase in the sfr over the past @xmath13 years . </S>",
    "<S> for the nuclear spectra , all of the above correlations except @xmath5 vs. @xmath14 are weaker than for the disk , indicating that in lopsided galaxies , the sf boost is not dominated by the nucleus . </S>"
