    "over the past 15 years , it has become increasingly clear that supermassive black holes are an essential component of a galaxy , as demonstrated by the correlations connecting black hole masses and galaxy bulge properties ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "supermassive black holes are thought to regulate galaxy properties and influence star formation via feedback processes @xcite , however the black hole ",
    "bulge relations can also arise because of the inherent averaging associated with random galaxy mergers , without the need for the black hole to actively influence its host galaxy @xcite .",
    "roughly 80 dynamical black hole mass ( @xmath7 ) measurements have been made to date @xcite , almost exclusively through the use of high angular resolution facilities such as the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) and 8@xmath810 m ground - based telescopes with the aid of adaptive optics ( ao ) . despite the growing number of black hole mass measurements , the local black hole mass census is highly incomplete . gaining a more complete picture of black hole demographics and a deeper understanding the mechanisms that drive black hole / galaxy evolution requires the secure measurement of many more black holes , particularly those at the extremes of the black hole mass scale and in a wider range of galaxy types .    with the goal of finding more objects suitable for future dynamical black hole mass measurements , the het massive galaxy survey obtained long - slit spectra of @xmath91000 galaxies using the hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) at mcdonald observatory @xcite .",
    "the survey uncovered a sample of interesting early - type galaxies with small sizes and high stellar velocity dispersions for their luminosities .",
    "more quantitatively , these galaxies have an effective radius , @xmath10 , below 3 kpc , a central stellar velocity dispersion larger than @xmath11 km s@xmath0 , and @xmath1-band luminosities @xmath9@xmath12 .",
    "the het spectra hint that these compact , high - dispersion galaxies could host some of the largest black holes known ( @xmath13 ) , and that the black holes could weigh a high fraction of its host galaxy s mass .",
    "six example objects were highlighted in @xcite , and orbit - based stellar dynamical models were calculated for one galaxy , ngc 1277 . in the case of ngc 1277 , @xcite found a @xmath14 black hole that is surprisingly 59% of the galaxy s bulge mass , or 14% of the galaxy s total mass . while @xcite infer a similar @xmath7 from seeing - limited , large - scale integral field unit ( ifu ) data , @xcite show a smaller black hole of a few billion solar masses can also reasonably reproduce the observed het long - slit kinematics presented in @xcite .",
    "obtaining secure black hole mass measurements for the other compact , high - dispersion galaxies found through the het massive galaxy survey is important for addressing questions concerning the upper end of the black hole ",
    "host galaxy relationships . with the present sample of black hole mass measurements ,",
    "the slope , intrinsic scatter , and even the shape of the correlations for high - mass black holes are not well established ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "also , the black hole mass  stellar velocity dispersion relation ( @xmath7  @xmath15 ) and the black hole mass  bulge luminosity relation ( @xmath7  @xmath16 ) are in direct conflict at the upper end , and make drastically different predictions for the inferred number density of the most massive black holes @xcite .",
    "not only are the compact , high - dispersion galaxies from the het survey useful for filling in the poorly sampled high - mass end of the black hole relations , but also the mass estimates from @xmath7  @xmath15 and @xmath7  @xmath16 differ by a factor of at least three .",
    "consequently , the galaxies are also useful for testing which of the correlations is more fundamental and a better predictor of @xmath7 at the high - mass end of the scaling relations .",
    "while recent progress has been made in searching for , and revising measurements for , black holes with masses larger than @xmath17 @xcite , many of these galaxies are giant ellipticals or brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) , which are often large ( with @xmath18 kpc ; e.g. , @xcite ) , have cored surface brightness profiles , and are dispersion - supported showing little to no rotation .",
    "in contrast , the compact , high - dispersion galaxies found through the het survey are small , rapidly rotating , and generally exhibit cuspy surface brightness profiles .",
    "such host galaxy environments havent been extensively explored on the black hole  host galaxy relationships . besides ngc 1277",
    ", only the compact galaxies ngc 1332 @xcite , ngc 4342 @xcite , ngc 4486b @xcite , and m60-ucd1 @xcite have dynamical black hole mass measurements , with ngc 1332 and ngc 4342 being most like ngc 1277 .",
    "for these galaxies , the black hole mass measurements are in agreement with @xmath7  @xmath15 given the intrinsic scatter of the relation , but are positive outliers from the @xmath7 ",
    "@xmath16 relation @xcite .",
    "we note that there are uncertainties associated with the bulge luminosity for ngc 1332 ( see @xcite for details ) and the black hole mass measurement for ngc 4486b ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "also , tidal stripping is believed to be the cause of the over - massive black hole in the ultracompact dwarf galaxy m60-ucd1 @xcite , and there is some debate as to whether ngc 4486b and ngc 4342 have been stripped as well ( e.g. , @xcite ) . nevertheless , additional similar galaxies need to be studied because there could be systematic differences in the scaling relations between the compact , high - dispersion galaxies and the giant ellipticals / bcgs .",
    "if so , that would imply that the black holes in the two types of galaxies grew in different ways .    while the compact , high - dispersion galaxies are unusual in the present - day universe , they are qualitatively similar to the typical @xmath19 quiescent galaxies , which are also small , have disk - like features , and could have high velocity dispersions @xcite .",
    "the @xmath19 red nuggets are believed to be the progenitors of the massive early - type galaxies seen today , evolved in size and mass ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the compact , high - dispersion galaxies found through the het survey could provide clues to the link between local galaxies and the @xmath19 red nuggets , the ultra compact sub - mm galaxies at @xmath20 @xcite , and the early massive black holes found in @xmath21 quasars @xcite .",
    "we have begun to obtain the imaging and spectroscopic observations necessary for a detailed examination of the compact , high - dispersion galaxies from the het massive galaxy survey .",
    "this includes _",
    "hst _ and ao - assisted ifu observations to probe the region over which the black hole dominates the galaxy s potential ( the black hole sphere of influence ; @xmath22 ) , and ifu observations that sample the large - scale stellar kinematics out to several effective radii . in this paper",
    ", we focus on measuring the mass of the black hole for the first compact , high - dispersion galaxy for which we have completed ao ifu observations .",
    "ngc 1271 has not been widely investigated in the literature and is given an uncertain sb0 classification according to the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "the galaxy is located within the perseus cluster , at @xmath23 , and we adopt a distance to ngc 1271 of 80 mpc , which is the hubble flow distance derived from the @xcite virgo + great attractor + shapley supercluster infall velocity field model assuming a hubble constant of @xmath24 km s@xmath0 mpc@xmath0 , a matter density of @xmath25 and a cosmological constant of @xmath26 .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey @xmath27 color is 1.6 and absolute @xmath28-band magnitude is -20.8 for the galaxy .",
    "long - slit spectra of ngc 1271 were obtained through the het massive galaxy survey , and the reported [ ] /h@xmath29 and [ ] /h@xmath30 emission - line ratios measured within a 35 aperture @xcite place ngc 1271 just within the composite galaxies section near the active galactic nuclei side of @xcite .",
    "also , @xcite do not find the presence of any broad emission lines .    in section [ sec : obs ]",
    ", we describe the imaging and spectroscopic observations , including the data reduction procedures .",
    "we present the luminous mass model for the galaxy in section [ sec : stellarmassmodel ] and the stellar kinematics in section [ sec : stellarkin ] .",
    "our determination of the point - spread function ( psf ) for the spectroscopic observations is discussed in section [ sec : psf ] , and an overview of the orbit - based stellar dynamical models is given in section [ sec : models ] . in section [ sec : results ] , we present the results of the models and examine possible sources of systematic uncertainty .",
    "finally , in sections [ sec : discussion ] and [ sec : conclusion ] , we study the galaxy s orbital structure , discuss ngc 1271 within the context of the @xmath7  host galaxy relationships , and summarize our findings .",
    "for ngc 1271 , we obtained imaging observations with the _ hst _ wide - field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) in order to measure the galaxy s surface brightness distribution .",
    "we also acquired spectra with the near - infrared integral field spectrometer ( nifs ; @xcite ) on the 8.1 m gemini north telescope assisted by the alttitude conjugate adaptive optics for the infrared @xcite system .",
    "the nifs data is important for constraining @xmath7 , as it resolves the black hole sphere of influence .",
    "we also acquired large - scale spectra with the postdam multi aperture spectrograph ( pmas ; @xcite ) in the pmas fiber pack ( ppak ; @xcite ) mode at the 3.5 m telescope at calar alto observatory . although long - slit spectroscopic observations along the galaxy major axis have been previously made using the het , measuring a large - scale , two - dimensional ( 2d ) velocity field is preferable over a single slit observation for constraining the stellar mass - to - light ratio and the stellar orbital distribution .",
    "hence , we use the ppak ifu observations in place of the major - axis het measurements .",
    "below we describe the wfc3 , nifs , and ppak observations and data reduction methods .",
    "we observed ngc 1271 with _",
    "wfc3 and the ir / f160w filter under program go-13050 .",
    "the observation was composed of three dithered full array exposures of 450 s , and four dithered subarray exposures of 1.7 s , leading to a total integration time of 1354 s. the short subarray exposures were chosen to ensure the nucleus would not become saturated .",
    "the flattened , calibrated images were corrected for geometric distortions , cleaned , and combined using astrodrizzle @xcite . since the exposures were dominated by galaxy light , we found that the standard astrodrizzle sky subtraction overestimated the background flux .",
    "we therefore manually measured the background level in each of the images . for the full array images , we measured the flux from the corners of each image , while for the subarray exposures we measured the flux difference between the sky - subtracted full frames and the subarray frames . with",
    "the background level determined , the exposures were combined to produce a super - sampled image with a spatial resolution of 006 pixel@xmath0 . not only is the _ hst _ image suitable for determining the luminous distribution on near the black hole , but due to the small size of ngc 1271 , we were also able to measure the luminosity out to larger galaxy scales , extending to @xmath95 @xmath10 ( adopting an effective radius of 56 , or 2.2 kpc , measured from a single component srsic fit to the _ hst _ f160w image ; see section [ subsec : bhrels ] ) .      the nifs laser guide star ( lgs ) ao observations were acquired over three nights , on 2012 dec 27 , 2012 dec 29 , and 2013 jan 8 , in queue mode under program gn-2012b - q-51 .",
    "we used the @xmath31 filter and the @xmath1 grating with a central wavelength of 2.2 @xmath32 m to obtain spectra over a 3@xmath333  field - of - view and a spectral resolution of r@xmath95290 .",
    "we recorded 900 s exposures of the galaxy nucleus , following an object - sky - object observing sequence , totaling 3 hours of on - source integration .",
    "an @xmath34 mag star located 17  away from the galaxy was used as the tip - tilt reference .",
    "in addition , we observed the tip - tilt star to monitor the psf during each of the three nights and the a0  v stars hip 10559 and hip 22842 for telluric correction .",
    "the data were reduced using iraf tasks within the gemini / nifs package version 1.11 , utilizing the example nifs processing scripts .",
    "the reduction included sky subtraction , flat fielding , interpolation over bad pixels , cosmic - ray cleaning , and spatial rectification and wavelength calibration using ronchi mask and arc lamp exposures .",
    "the spectra were then corrected for telluric features , using an a0  v star spectrum , after interpolating over the br@xmath35 absorption line and dividing by a black body with a temperature of 9480 k. next , a data cube was produced , having @xmath36 and @xmath37 spatial dimensions , each with a scale of 005 pixel@xmath0 , and one spectral dimension , @xmath38 , using a common wavelength range and sampling for the individual science exposures .",
    "the relative spatial positions between the data cubes were determined by summing along the wavelength axis and cross - correlating the resulting flux maps .",
    "the offsets were used to align and combine the 12 individual exposures , generating the final data cube of the galaxy .",
    "data reduction of the psf star observations followed a similar procedure .",
    "the ppak observations of ngc 1271 were acquired as part of a campaign to obtain large - scale spectroscopy of the compact , high - dispersion galaxies .",
    "the observations , data reduction , and kinematic measurements for ngc 1271 will be presented in @xcite , but follow closely the ppak observations for two other compact , high - dispersion galaxies described in @xcite . for completeness",
    ", we briefly review the pertinent information below and in section [ subsec : ppakkin ] .",
    "the wide - field ifu observations were taken over three nights , from 2013 jan 4 - 6 , using the v500 grating to provide coverage of @xmath39   with a spectral resolution of r@xmath9850 at 5000  .",
    "we used three dithers to fully sample the 331 27-diameter fibers , to increase the spatial resolution of the data , and to address effects of vignetting and bad pixels .",
    "an additional 36 fibers , located 72  away from the center of the instrument field - of - view , were used to measure the sky . during each of the three nights",
    ", two 1200 s science exposures were taken at each of the three dither positions , leading to a total of 6 hours of on - source integration .",
    "the data reduction followed the procedure adopted for the calar alto legacy integral field spectroscopy area survey .",
    "the main steps included bias subtraction , flat - fielding , cosmic ray cleaning , extraction of spectra , wavelength calibration , sky subtraction , and flux calibration using spectrophotometric standard stars .",
    "spectra from the three pointings were then combined and resampled into a data cube , followed by a correction for differential atmospheric refraction .",
    "we note that the line spread function is measured as a function of wavelength and fiber position from arc lamps during the wavelength calibration step , and then homogenized to a common value prior to the extraction of the ppak kinematics .",
    "the details of these steps are discussed at length by @xcite and @xcite and we refer the reader to those publications for additional information .",
    "we generated a luminous mass model for ngc 1271 by parameterizing the _ hst _",
    "wfc3 f160w image as the sum of 2d gaussians using the multi - gaussian expansion ( mge ) formalism @xcite .",
    "the mge method is able to reproduce a wide range of galaxy surface brightness profiles and allows for an analytic deprojection to determine the intrinsic luminosity density . here",
    ", we use the image decomposition package galfit @xcite because it takes into consideration an error map during the fit and allows for the detailed examination of model residuals , but we utilize the implementation of @xcite to determine suitable starting parameter values for the initial run with galfit .",
    "when constructing the mge model , we account for the wfc3 psf , which we adopt from @xcite .",
    "this psf was generated with tiny tim @xcite for the f160w filter at the center of the wfc3 detector assuming a g2 v spectral type , and drizzled to produce a psf with the same spatial scale as our final science image of ngc 1271 .",
    "in addition , we identified foreground objects using the program sextractor @xcite and masked these regions during the mge fit .",
    "the final mge model contained 11 components , where each gaussian was set to have the same position angle and center and the projected axis ratio ( @xmath40 ) was required to be larger than 0.25 .",
    "due to the degeneracy associated with fitting a large number of gaussians , we chose to restrict @xmath41 in order to avoid highly flattened components that place very stringent constraints on the viewing angles for which a model can be deprojected .",
    "the final mge model is an good representation of the galaxy , as can be seen in figure [ fig : mge ] .",

    "from the nifs and ppak data cubes , we measured the line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) as a function of spatial location .",
    "the losvd was described using the first four gauss - hermite ( gh ) moments : the radial velocity ( @xmath42 ) , the velocity dispersion ( @xmath43 ) , and @xmath44 and @xmath45 , which describe the losvd s asymmetric and symmetric deviations from a gaussian .",
    "high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) spectra , typically @xmath46 , are required in order to reliably extract the higher order gh moments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and thus we use the voronoi binning algorithm @xcite in order to construct spatial bins that optimize the balance between spatial resolution and s / n .",
    "we then used the penalized pixel fitting ( ppxf ) method of @xcite to measure the stellar kinematics in each bin .",
    "this procedure determines the best - fitting losvd by convolving with a stellar template to match the observed galaxy spectra .",
    "errors on the kinematics were determined using monte carlo simulations , in which random gaussian noise was added to the spectrum based upon the ppxf model residuals .",
    "we performed 100 realizations and from the distributions measured the standard deviation to determine 1@xmath43 uncertainties . during",
    "the monte carlo runs , the penalization term was set to zero to produce realistic errors .",
    "we measured the stellar kinematics from the three primary @xmath1-band co bandheads [ @xmath47co , @xmath48co , and @xmath49co ] in 127 spatial bins by using ppxf to fit the wavelength region between @xmath50 m . we made use of the nifs spectral template library v2.0 @xcite , which contains 28 stars observed using the nifs ifu with the @xmath1 grating and @xmath51 filter .",
    "the library includes spectral types ranging from g8 - m5 giant stars , k3 - m3 supergiants , and a g8 ii star .",
    "we first created an optimal stellar template by fitting a high s / n spectrum , constructed by adding together all spectra in the galaxy data cube .",
    "this optimal template was composed of six stars , and was dominated by m5 iii , m3 iii , and k3 iab stars that make up 37% , 26% , and 21% of the total flux , respectively .",
    "next , we measured the gh moments in each spatial bin with ppxf by keeping the relative weights of the stars that make up the template fixed , but allowing the coefficients of a second degree additive legendre polynomial and a second degree multiplicative legendre polynomial to vary .",
    "such polynomials are needed to account for differences in the optimal stellar template and the galaxy spectra shape , as the continuum of the stars in the nifs spectral template library has been previously removed .",
    "the kinematics were in good agreement with those measured when fitting a new optimal stellar template to each spatial bin and fitting only two gh moments .",
    "finally , we bi - symmetrize the kinematics using the machinery presented @xcite .",
    "since the dynamical models are only able to produce symmetric kinematics , this step is commonly performed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in order to reduce the noise in the observations . with the symmetrization routine ,",
    "the systematic offsets in the odd gh moments , such as the galaxy s recession velocity , are removed as well .    from the nifs data , we find that the galaxy is rotating quickly , with stars reaching velocities of @xmath52 km s@xmath0 .",
    "there is also a sharp peak in the velocity dispersion , which rises from 205 km s@xmath0 at a radius of @xmath91  to 396 km s@xmath0 at the center .",
    "the map of @xmath44 is anti - correlated with the velocity map , while @xmath45 shows a slight increase at the center .",
    "the s / n in each spatial bin ( measured as the ratio between the median value of the spectrum and standard deviation of the ppxf model residuals ) ranged between 33 and 96 with a median value of 66 .",
    "therefore , we were able to place excellent constraints on the kinematics , with median errors over all spatial bins of @xmath53 km s@xmath0 , @xmath54 km s@xmath0 , @xmath55 , and @xmath55 for @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , respectively .",

    ", we adopt a ( nearly ) oblate axisymmetric shape , with an intermediate to long axis ratio of 0.99 .",

    "the mge description of ngc 1271 presented in section [ sec : stellarmassmodel ] includes a couple of flat gaussian components , which can only be deprojected for angles @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , we chose to run models at a fixed inclination angle that lies midway between the extremes .",
    "our choice of inclination angle is further supported by a nuclear dust disk that appears highly inclined in an _ hst _",
    "wfc3 f814w image .",
    "while the f814w image clearly shows a regular dust lane , the f160w image and the @xmath1-band nifs data cube used in our analysis do not appear to be significantly affected by dust .",
    "in addition , the ngc 1271 models include a spherically symmetric dark matter halo following a navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) form @xcite .",
    "the parameters describing the nfw halo are the concentration index ( @xmath65 ) and the fraction of dark matter ( @xmath66 ) , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 is the halo virial mass and @xmath69 is the stellar mass .",

    "we began by calculating models on a coarse grid that spanned a wide range of values before generating models on a smaller , more finely sampled grid focused around the minimum @xmath60 . ultimately , our final model grid contained 21 @xmath7 values , 31 @xmath70 values , 8 @xmath65 values , and 20 @xmath66 values with @xmath71 $ ] , @xmath72 $ ] , @xmath73 $ ] , and @xmath74 $ ] .",
    "the orbit library samples 29 equipotential shells with radii between 0003 to 100 , and 8 angular and 8 radial values at each energy .",
    "we note that triaxial orbit families ( e.g. , box orbits ) continue to be included in our orbital libraries because we are running a triaxial schwarzschild code in the axisymmetric limit .",
    "moreover , we employ a dithering method , in which 125 orbits with adjacent initial conditions are bundled together , to establish a smooth distribution function when constructing schwarzschild models .",
    "thus , the galaxy models are made with 696,000 orbits .",
    "the models were fit to the observed nifs and ppak kinematics , where 4 gh moments were measured in a total of 395 bins , resulting in 1580 observables .",
    "the results of the final model grid are summarized in figure [ fig : chi2plots ] , which shows the @xmath60 as a function of @xmath7 , @xmath70 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 after marginalizing over the other three parameters .",

    "the @xmath60 per degree of freedom ( @xmath80 ) is 0.3 .",
    "if the unsymmetrized kinematics are used instead , the best - fit model has @xmath81 and an @xmath7 and @xmath82 that are consistent within the final uncertainties given below in section [ subsec : errorbudget ] .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig : chi2plots ] , we are able to place strong constraints on @xmath7 and @xmath70 . by searching for the range of @xmath7 , or @xmath70 , values that caused the minimum @xmath60 to increase by 1 and 9",

    "in contrast , the dark halo parameters are not well constrained , and the @xmath65 and @xmath66 values are highly uncertain . specifically , the marginalized @xmath60 curve for @xmath65 is unconstrained at the upper end , with @xmath87 at the 3@xmath43 level .",
    "although the best - fit value for @xmath65 is at the maximum value considered in our final model grid , previous runs using coarsely sampled grids showed no sign of convergence for large values of @xmath65 .",
    "similarly , the marginalized @xmath60 curve for @xmath66 is essentially flat , and all @xmath66 values sampled by our grid ( @xmath88 ) are allowed within 3@xmath43 . the best - fit value found for @xmath66 is the minimum value considered in our final grid , but we also ran models without a dark halo and found a significantly worse fit , such that the @xmath60 increased by 123 relative to the best - fit model with a dark halo .",
    "thus , a dark halo is required to match the observed kinematics , but its properties can not be pinned down with the current datasets and we do not present any further details associated with the dark halo parameters .      the formal model fitting uncertainties quoted in the previous section are the statistical errors associated with the dynamical models , however systematic effects can have a significant impact on the inferred black hole mass and mass - to - light ratio . in this section ,",
    "we evaluate some common sources of uncertainty that are not already incorporated into the statistical errors , such as those associated with the assumed form of the dark matter halo , the adopted inclination angle , the number of orbits used in the models , the nifs psf model , details associated with the extraction of the nifs kinematics , and the symmetrization of the input kinematics .",
    "_ dark matter halo _ : previous work has clearly shown that the dark halo could be an important component in the stellar dynamical models due to the degeneracy between the dark halo and stellar mass - to - light ratio , which in turn is also degenerate with the black hole ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if @xmath89 is spatially well resolved , then the degeneracy between the black hole and mass - to - light ratio can be mitigated , and the exclusion of a dark halo will have minimal impact on the inferred @xmath7 .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath89 is not very well resolved and a dark halo is not included in the stellar dynamical models , then @xmath59 will be artificially elevated to account for the missing mass at large radii . since @xmath59 is taken to be constant with radius , a smaller @xmath7 is then required to fit the observed central kinematics .",
    "when generating a grid of models without a dark halo for ngc 1271 , and assuming @xmath62 to match our fiducial model presented in section [ sec : results ] , we measure @xmath90 and @xmath91 . in other words , the inferred @xmath7 is underestimated by a factor of @xmath92 when a dark halo is excluded from the modeling .",
    "we note that when fitting dynamical models without a dark halo to only the small - scale nifs kinematics , we recover very similar parameter values as those found from our fiducial model , with @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "moreover , we tested how the assumed shape of the dark halo affects @xmath7 .",
    "our fiducial model was calculated assuming a spherical nfw halo , but another common form is a halo with a cored logarithmic potential @xcite , given by    @xmath94    the parameters @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the asymptotic circular velocity and radius within which the dark matter density is constant .",
    "thus , the halo from a logarithmic potential yields smaller densities at small radii compared the the nfw halo .",
    "we constructed models with a dark halo from a cored logarithmic potential , sampling @xmath97 , @xmath98 @xmath99 , @xmath100 km s@xmath0 , and @xmath101 kpc .",

    "although the black hole mass is sensitive to the inclusion of a dark halo in the stellar dynamical models , the form of the halo has a small impact on @xmath7 .",
    "for this reason , being unable to constrain the dark halo parameters is not a concern for the purposes of this paper , as long as reasonable halos are sampled over when constructing the orbit - based models .",
    "_ inclination angle _ : all of the models presented in this paper assume an axisymmetric shape with an inclination angle of @xmath62",

    "this corresponds to the range of angles for which the mge model in section [ sec : stellarmassmodel ] can be deprojected .",
    "it is computationally expensive to calculate a model grid that samples over @xmath7 , @xmath82 , @xmath61 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 simultaneously , so we instead varied the first three parameters while sampling over five nfw halos .",

    "a four - component psf model provided a significantly better fit to the collapsed data cube than a simpler two - component model , and the residuals between the four gaussian model and the data have a standard deviation of just 9% out to a radius of 1 .",
    "the psf is typical of what one would expect from the gemini ao system ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and the quality of the ao correction is better than that implied by the psf adopted in the fiducial model .",
    "this is not completely surprising as the nifs observations of the star used the star itself for tip - tilt corrections , whereas the observations of the galaxy were made off - axis , using the star for guiding .",
    "nonetheless , calculating stellar dynamical models using this better psf and comparing to the results using the poorer psf should cover the range of possible black hole masses due to the uncertainty in the nifs psf .",

    "we present the nifs observations of the velocity dispersion and @xmath45 along with the predictions from the best - fitting model with a black hole mass of @xmath166 and a @xmath167 black hole .",

    "clear differences between the kinematic predictions and the observations can be seen by eye .",
    "the best - fit model with @xmath170 is able to nicely reproduce the sharp rise in the velocity dispersion and the slight peak in @xmath45 at the nucleus , while the less massive black hole predicted from @xmath7  @xmath16 fails to do so .",
    "ngc 1271 has an apparent ellipticity of @xmath171 and a specific stellar angular momentum of @xmath172 within one effective radius based on the ppak data . here ,",
    "@xmath173 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 are the radius , velocity , and velocity dispersion and the brackets denote a luminosity weighted average @xcite . using the dividing line between slow and fast rotators from the atlas@xmath174 survey , such that fast rotators have @xmath175 @xcite , ngc 1271 falls well within in this fast rotator regime .",

    "the black holes , however , are consistent with @xmath7  @xmath15 given the intrinsic scatter of the relation .",
    "in the case of m60-ucd1 , @xcite suggest that the ultracompact dwarf galaxy ( ucd ) was once the nucleus of a larger galaxy that has since been tidally stripped by the giant elliptical m60 , whose center lies at a projected distance of just 6.6 kpc away from the ucd . while tidal stripping is a natural explanation for the presence of an over - massive black hole , in the case of ngc 1271 , we do not see signs of active stripping in the _ hst _ image .",

    "ngc 1271 is @xmath9270 kpc in projection from the bcg of perseus .",
    "further evidence could come from counting the number of globular clusters , as the galaxy would be stripped of its globular clusters first .",
    "while ngc 1271 appears not to have been stripped with our current data , we can not rule out an event in the distant past .",
    "interestingly , the behavior of the compact , high - dispersion galaxies being consistent with @xmath7  @xmath15 but being large positive outliers on @xmath7 ",
    "@xmath16 could be in conflict with recent observations of bcgs , which instead may hint that black hole mass becomes independent of @xmath15 at high black hole mass while the @xmath7 ",
    "@xmath16 correlation remains unchanged at large luminosities @xcite .",
    "clearly , more compact , high - dispersion galaxies and bcgs / giant ellipticals need to be examined . there could be systematic differences in the scaling relations between the two types of galaxies , thereby imply different mechanisms for black hole growth .",
    "since the compact , high - dispersion galaxies like ngc 1271 look similar to the quiescent @xmath19 red nuggets , they could be relics that somehow avoided the same fate that ultimately produced the giant ellipticals observed today .",
    "perhaps the compact , high - dispersion galaxies are left over from an era when the local black hole scaling relations did not apply and galaxies instead contained over - massive black holes .",
    "to summarize , we obtained ao - assisted gemini nifs observations of ngc 1271 to map out the stellar kinematics on scales comparable to the black hole sphere of influence , and large - scale ifu data with ppak , which are useful for constraining the galaxy s stellar mass - to - light ratio and orbital distribution . using an _ hst _",

    "we measure @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "the quoted errors combine the 1@xmath43 model fitting uncertainties with some common sources of systematic uncertainty that affect stellar dynamical models .",
    "the black hole in ngc 1271 is at the upper end of the black hole mass distribution ( @xmath178 ) . yet , this compact , rapidly rotating galaxy , with a high stellar velocity dispersion for its luminosity is very different from the giant elliptical galaxies and bcgs that are expected to harbor the most massive black holes in the universe .",
    "such host galaxy environments have yet to be widely explored on the @xmath7  host galaxy relations . with our mass measurement ,",
    "we find that the black hole is too large for the galaxy s @xmath1-band bulge luminosity of @xmath179 , falling an order of magnitude above the expectation from the @xmath7  @xmath16 correlation , but the black hole mass is consistent with expectations from the @xmath7  @xmath15 relationship assuming @xmath180 km s@xmath0 .",
    "this behavior has also been observed in the few other compact galaxies that have dynamical black hole mass measurements to date .",
    "carrying out more black hole mass measurements in similar galaxies using high spatial resolution observations from _ hst _ and ao is necessary in order to determine if there are systematic differences in the black hole scaling relations between the large ellipticals / bcgs and these compact , high - dispersion galaxies .",
    "the compact , high - dispersion galaxies could be remnants of the @xmath19 red nugets that for some reason did not evolve into the largest ellipticals observed today , and instead reflect a time when black holes were too large for their bulges .",
    "more broadly , additional black hole mass measurements are needed in order to enlarge and better fill in undersampled regions of galaxy parameter space .",
    "targeting such a large and carefully selected sample with high spatial resolution facilities is a natural step toward gaining a more complete census of local black holes and a better understanding of the role that black holes play in galaxy evolution .",
