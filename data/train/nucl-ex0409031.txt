    "alice is the dedicated heavy - ion experiment at the lhc and its primary physics goal is the investigation of the properties of qcd matter at the energy densities of several hundred times the density of atomic nuclei that will be reached in central  collisions . in these conditions a deconfined state of quarks and gluons , the quark ",
    "gluon plasma ( qgp ) , is expected to be formed  @xcite .",
    "as we shall detail in the following section  [ probes ] , heavy quarks , and hard partons in general , probe this medium via the mechanism of qcd energy loss  @xcite .",
    "an estimate of the medium - induced suppression of open charm mesons is presented in section  [ dquenching ] , along with the expected alice sensitivity for the measurement of this effect .",
    "the unique features of the alice detector , such as the low - momentum acceptance and the excellent particle identification , will also allow a rich program of pp physics , complementary to the those of atlas , cms and lhcb .",
    "one outstanding example is the measurement of the charm production cross section , which is described in section  [ results ] .",
    "heavy quarks are produced in primary partonic scatterings with large virtuality @xmath3 ( momentum transfer ) and , thus , on short temporal and spatial scales , @xmath4 .",
    "in fact , the minimum virtuality @xmath5 in the production of a @xmath6 pair implies a space - time scale of @xmath7 ( for charm ) .",
    "therefore , in   collisions , the hard production process itself should not be affected by the successive formation of the high - density deconfined medium .    given the large virtualities that characterize the production of heavy quarks ,",
    "the cross sections in  collisions can be calculated in the framework of collinear factorization and perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) .",
    "the inclusive differential @xmath8 cross section is written as : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the perturbative partonic hard part , calculable as a power series in the strong coupling @xmath11 , which depends on the renormalization scale @xmath12 ; currently , calculations are performed up to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , @xmath13 .",
    "the nucleon parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) for each parton @xmath14 at momentum fraction @xmath15 and factorization scale @xmath16 , which can be interpreted as the virtuality of the hard process , are denoted by @xmath17 . at lhc energies , there are large uncertainties , of about a factor 2 , on the charm and beauty production cross sections , estimated by varying the values of the masses and of the scales @xmath16 and @xmath12 ( much smaller uncertainties , @xmath18 , arise from the indetermination in the pdfs )  @xcite .",
    "different predictions for the d - meson cross section as a function of the transverse momentum ( @xmath19 ) will be shown in section  [ results ] , along with the alice capability to constrain the pqcd parameter space for charm production .",
    "for hard processes such as heavy - quark production , in the absence of nuclear and medium effects , a   collision would behave as a superposition of independent nn collisions .",
    "the hard processes yields would then scale from pp to aa proportionally to the number of inelastic nn collisions ( binary scaling ) . applying binary scaling to ` average ' pqcd results and taking into account nuclear shadowing effects the pdf suppression at small @xmath20 in the nucleus we expect about 115 @xmath21 and about 5 @xmath22 pairs per central ( 5% @xmath23 )  collision at @xmath24 (",
    "these numbers are obtained at nlo using the hvqmnr program  @xcite with @xmath25 and @xmath26 for charm and @xmath27 and @xmath28 for beauty , where @xmath29 ; the pdf set is cteq 4 m  @xcite corrected for nuclear shadowing according to the eks98 parameterization  @xcite ) .",
    "deviations from binary scaling correspond to deviations from unity of the _ nuclear modification factor _ ( here defined for d mesons ) : @xmath30 note that at the lhc , pp and  collisions will be run at different energies and an extrapolation of the measured pp yields will have to be applied to define @xmath31 . such extrapolation can be reliably done by means of pqcd , since it was shown  @xcite that the ratios of calculation results at different @xmath32 are basically insensitive to the choice of masses and scales .",
    "experiments at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) have shown that the nuclear modification factor is a powerful tool for the study of the interaction of the produced hard partons with the medium formed in the collision .",
    "the suppression of a factor 45 of @xmath31 for charged hadrons and neutral pions for @xmath33 observed in central au ",
    "au collisions at @xmath34@xmath35 is interpreted as a consequence of parton energy loss in a dense medium  @xcite .",
    "an intense theoretical activity has developed around the subject of parton energy loss via medium - induced gluon radiation  @xcite . in our sensitivity studies ( see section  [ dquenching ] ) we have considered the bdmps model in the multiple soft scattering approximation  @xcite .",
    "its main features are summarized in the functional form of the average energy loss for a high - energy ( @xmath36 ) hard parton with path length @xmath37 in the medium : @xmath38 @xmath39 is the casimir coupling factor ( 3 if the considered hard parton is a gluon , 4/3 if it is a quark ) ; @xmath40 is the transport coefficient of the medium , defined as the average transverse momentum squared transferred to the projectile per unit mean free path and it is proportional to the density of scattering centres ( gluons ) in the medium and to the typical momenta exchanged in interactions with such centres ; the characteristic @xmath41-dependence arises from the non - abelian nature of qcd .",
    "the average energy loss is independent of the initial parton energy @xmath42 , if this is very large . in the more realistic case of parton energies of @xmath43@xmath44",
    ", there is an intrinsic dependence of the radiated energy on the initial energy , determined by the fact that the former can not be larger than the latter , @xmath45 .",
    "a rigorous theoretical treatment of this finite - energy constraint is at present lacking in the bdmps framework and approximations have to be adopted , which introduce uncertainties in the results  @xcite .    due to the large values of their masses the charm and beauty quarks are qualitatively different probes from light partons .",
    "heavy quarks with momenta up to @xmath46@xmath47 propagate with a velocity significantly lower than the velocity of light . as a consequence gluon radiation at angles @xmath48 smaller than their mass - to - energy ratio @xmath49",
    "is suppressed by destructive interference  @xcite . the relatively depopulated cone around the heavy - quark direction with @xmath50",
    "is called ` dead cone ' . in ref .",
    "@xcite , on the basis of an approximation of the dead - cone effect , charm quarks were predicted to lose much less energy than light quarks .",
    "a recent detailed calculation  @xcite confirms this qualitative feature , although the effect is found to be quantitatively smaller than in ref .",
    "@xcite .    at the lhc",
    ", the abundant production of charm quarks will allow to study the mass dependence of parton quenching and , thus , to test experimentally these effects .",

    "excellent tracking and vertexing capabilities are necessary to extract the signal out of the huge combinatorial background in central  collisions , where up to several thousand charged particles might be produced per unit of rapidity ( simulations were performed with @xmath69 )",
    ".    the barrel tracking system of alice , composed of the inner tracking system ( its ) , the time projection chamber ( tpc ) and the transition radiation detector ( trd ) , embedded in a magnetic field of @xmath70  t , allows track reconstruction in the pseudorapidity range @xmath71 with a momentum resolution better than 2% for @xmath72 and an impact - parameter resolution ( shown in the bottom - left panel of fig .",

    "the detection strategy  @xcite to cope with the large combinatorial background from the underlying event is based on the selection of displaced - vertex topologies .",
    "the impact parameter @xmath77 is given a sign according to the position of the track with respect to the main interaction vertex , so that well - separated signal topologies have impact parameters , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , large and with opposite signs .",
    "therefore , the product of the impact parameters is required to be negative and large in absolute value , e.g. @xmath80 .",
    "another suitable variable is the pointing angle @xmath81 between the reconstructed @xmath55 momentum and its flight - line ( see sketch in fig .",
    "[ fig : d0combined ] ) , which is required to be close to zero , e.g. @xmath82 .",
    "we found that these two variables are strongly correlated for the signal and uncorrelated for the background combinations ( see bottom - right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : d0combined ] ) ; therefore , their simultaneous use is extremely efficient in increasing the signal - to - background ratio .",
    "after such selection , a standard invariant - mass analysis can be used to extract the amount of signal .",
    "the strategy was optimized separately for pp and  collisions , as a function of the @xmath55 transverse momentum  @xcite .",
    "the requirement of @xmath83 tagging for one of the two tracks in the high - resolution time - of - flight ( tof ) detector and the low value of the magnetic field allow to extend the @xmath55 signal extraction down to almost zero transverse momentum .    the expected performance for central  ( 5% @xmath23 ) and for pp collisions is summarized in fig .",
