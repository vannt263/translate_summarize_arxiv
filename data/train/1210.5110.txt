    "oscillations of filaments have been observed using h@xmath1 spectrograms since 1930s ( dyson 1930 ) .",
    "they are broadly classified into two groups according to their velocity amplitudes , namely , the  large - amplitude oscillations \" and  small - amplitude oscillations \" ( thompson & schmieder 1991 ; oliver & ballester 2002 ) .",
    "the large - amplitude oscillations occur when the entire filament oscillates with a velocity amplitude of the order of 20 km s@xmath0 or larger .",
    "the small - amplitude oscillations are localised to part of the filament , and have a velocity amplitude of the order of 23 km s@xmath0 or even less .",
    "there have been many studies about small - amplitude oscillations in the last few decades ( oliver 2009 ; ning et al .",

    "however , the large - amplitude oscillations are less widely reported ( okamoto et al . 2004 ; tripathi et al .",
    "2009 ; arregui et al .",
    "2012 ) .    moreover , most reported large - amplitude oscillations are perpendicular to the filament axis . this kind of transverse oscillations is often triggered by fast - mode magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) waves coming from distant flares ( ramsey & smith 1966 ; isobe & tripathi 2006 ; gilbert et al .",

    "( 2007 ) proposed that the lal oscillations were triggered by an injection of poloidal magnetic field into the flux rope , and the restoring force was caused by the magnetic pressure gradient along the filament axis .",
    "recently , luna & karpen ( 2012 ) first simulated the lal oscillations and suggested that the restoring force was the projected gravity in the flux tube dips where the threads oscillate .",
    "the oscillations were strongly damped by the mass accretion of the threads .",
    "zhang et al . ( 2012 ) analyzed the lal oscillations above the solar limb by using multi - wavelength data .",
    "their study suggested that the oscillations were excited due to plasma injection and the restoring force may be the gravity .    since there are different viewpoints on the physical nature of lal oscillations , further investigations are needed . in this letter , we present the first observations of the lal oscillations by the new atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ; lemen et al .",

    "all the data used here are corrected for solar rotation .",
    "the sp of the analyzed filament mainly consists of two parts ( parts 1 and 2 in figure 2__a _ _ ) , which have different axis directions ( slices a - b and c - d in figure 2__b _ _ ) . by examining the _ stereo _ a data",

    "furthermore , the main body of part 1 shows a helical motion in the image plane during the interval of the rise and shrinkage ( refer to images between 13:2713:34 ut and animations 2 and 4 in the online journal ) .    following the mass motion of the filament , the oscillations along part 1",
    "were clearly observed since 13:45 ut ( figure 3__a _ _ ) . at about 14:06 ut ,",

    "the oscillation in figure 3__b _ _ has a velocity amplitude of about 30 km s@xmath0 , and completes two cycles before it could be traced clearly .    by comparing the three oscillatory profiles in figure 3",

    ", the flow toward the north was also observed , and the velocity was about 50 km s@xmath0 . between 17:1217:36 ut , the oscillating material moved southwardly along slice e - f , and its velocity was about 20 km s@xmath0 . while the material at slice g - h moved northwardly with a velocity of @xmath3 10 km s@xmath0 ( the region between two blue dashed lines in figure 4__a _ _ ) . the oscillations of the sp",
    "last about 4 hr , almost 4 times the corresponding periods , before the onset of the filament eruption .",
    "at about 16:59 ut , a c2.4 flare occurred at the northeast of the sp ( figure 1__b _ _ ) , which peaked at 17:08 ut and ended at 17:15 ut .",
    "the two - ribbon flare was associated with no filament eruption and cme .",
    "the flare resulted in the southward mass motion along the axis of the sp ( see animations 1 and 3 in the online journal ) .",
    "about 30 min after the flare , the oscillating filament started to erupt toward the southwest in aia images and the eruption had a velocity range from 60 km s@xmath0 to 120 km s@xmath0 ( figure 4 ) .",
    "as seen in the inner ( cor1 ) and outer ( cor2 ) coronagraphs onboard the _ stereo _ a , the filament eruption finally resulted in a cme with an initial velocity of 200 km s@xmath0 in the cor1 s filed of view ( fov ) .",
    "the sp eruption was also associated with a b6.8 flare , which started at 19:08 ut , peaked at 19:55 ut and ended at 20:16 ut .    during the eruptive phase , several signatures that may suggest magnetic reconnection between filament threads were observed .",
    "partial filament material moved in the opposite direction ( from n to m in figure 2__c _ _ ) while the entire filament started to erupt southwardly at 17:45 ut .",
    "meanwhile , the region that the material flowed into displayed faint localized brightenings . to derive the inflow speed of the material",
    ", we used the stack plot shown in figure 4__c__. multi - threads that moved along slice m - n could be identified and the movements of the treads are recognized as bright lines in the stack plot ( marked with black dashed lines ) .",
    "the apparent velocity of the inflow is about 120 km s@xmath0 . at about 18:10 ut",
    ", intense and concentrated brightenings started near the position that the filament threads flowed into previously ( figure 2__d _ _ ) .",
    "about 2 min after the c2.4 flare occurring at the middle part of the entire filament ( 17:02 ut ) , the brightenings of filamentary threads nearby the flare ribbons were clearly observed ( see animations 1 and 3 in the online journal ) .",
    "subsequently , the north filament became activated and the northward mass motion along the filament axis was formed since 17:14 ut . from @xmath3 17:20",
    "ut , the great bulk of filament material coming from the south was injected to the np of the filament ( figure 5a ) .",
    "initially , the injected material moved toward the east and the average velocity was about 60 km s@xmath0 .",
    "then it changed its direction and turned back to the west upon reaching its maximum displacement at @xmath3 18:24 ut ( figure 5__c _ _ ) .",
    "the movement of the oscillating material is nearly along the axis of the np , which is also the lal oscillation .",
    "the oscillations have a period of @xmath3 57 min and last about 3 hr , almost three cycles before it damps out at last .",
    "in this letter , we report the first simultaneous observations of the lal oscillations of the filament and its later eruption .",
    "about 30 min before the filament eruption , a c2.4 flare occurred at the north of the sp .",
    "the flare resulted in the southward mass motion along the axis of the sp .",
    "this may suggest that the flare causes the transition from oscillations to the eruption .",
    "the flare may impose a strong impulse on the oscillating filament and leads to its loss of equilibrium that results in the filament eruption .",
    "the filament eruption was also associated with a cme and a b6.8 flare .",
    "chen et al . ( 2008 ) and bocchialini et al .",
    "( 2011 ) also presented observations of vertical and transverse oscillations prior to eruption .",
    "they suggested that filament oscillations could be considered as another precursor of cmes .",
    "the lal oscillations occur in the sp and np of the filament , and they have some common characteristics .",
    "they are both triggered by flare activities close to the filament ( jing et al .",
    "2003 ; vrnak et al .",
    "these flares may excite the mass motion along the filament axis and then the longitudinal oscillations are formed .",
    "the oscillations of different threads are out of phase , and their velocity amplitudes vary from 30 to 60 km s@xmath0 , with a maximum displacement of about 25 mm .",
    "the oscillations of the sp repeat for about 4 cycles without any significant damping before the onset of the filament eruption . for the np ,",
    "the oscillations damp with time and die out at last .",
    "generally , there are several physical mechanisms that have been proposed to explain various oscillations .",
    "now we compare these wave modes ( such as magnetic kink - mode wave , alfvnic oscillations and longitudinal slow magentosonic waves ) with our observational results .",
    "the transverse oscillations of filaments and coronal loops are interpreted as standing fundamental kink modes ( aschwanden et al .",
    "1999 ; ofman & wang 2008 ; hershaw et al .",
    "2011 ) , and the oscillating amplitude of the location close to the filament / loop footpoints is smaller than that of other locations .",
    "however , the variation of the amplitude with locations is not observed in our event ( figure 3a ) and the kink - mode oscillations can be ruled out .",
    "the direction of alfvnic oscillations is perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "however , the lal oscillations of the filaments are approximately along the direction of magnetic field",
    ". thus the lal oscillations should not be alfvnic oscillations . the propagating intensity disturbances in polar plumes and coronal loops",
    "are generally interpreted as slow magentosonic waves ( ofman et al .",
    "1999 , 2000 , 2012 ; de moortel et al .",
    "2000 ; wang 2011 ) . in our event",
    ", we find no significant phase propagation along the filament and thus the longitudinal slow magentosonic waves are also ruled out .",
    "we suggest that the restoring force is the coupling of the magnetic tension and gravity .",
    "our observations show that the activated part of the sp repeatedly shows a helical motion .",
    "this indicates that the magnetic structure of the filament is possibly modified during this process .",
    "the twisted field of the filament has the component perpendicular to the direction of the filament axis although it is mostly parallel to the filament axis .",
    "the motions of filamentary threads lead to distortion of the twisting magnetic field , and the field component perpendicular to the direction of the filament axis generates magnetic tension along the filament axis as the restoring force , similar to the analysis of jing et al .",
    "the gravity could also be considered as the restoring force .",
    "recently , luna & karpen ( 2012 ) and zhang et al . (",
    "2012 ) simulated lal oscillations and suggested that the restoring force was the projected gravity in the flux tube dips where the threads oscillate .",
    "the comprehensive understanding of the physical nature on the lal oscillations of filaments needs more observations and further analysis in the future . * assuming the restoring force is only the gravity , we estimate the minimum magnetic field strength in the filament as 2855 g according to the analysis of luna & karpen ( 2012 ) .",
    "if the restoring force is only the magnetic tension , the estimated magnetic field strength is about 32 g based on the study of kleczek & kuperus ( 1969 ) .",
    "these estimated magnetic field strengths of the filament are both similar to the observations of active region filament magnetic fields ( mackay et al .",
    "2010 ) , so it is difficult to determine which kind of force is dominant as the restoring force .",
    "we consider that there exists great uncertainty if we employ lal oscillations of filaments for corona seismology .",
    "*    we find that the oscillatory period varies with filamentary threads , ranging from 44 to 67 min .",
    "this discrepancy may suggest that the magnetic field and plasma condition of filamentary threads are different ( hershaw et al .",
    "due to different initiation times and oscillatory periods , the oscillatory phases of different filamentary threads are not synchronous , which indicates that the excited threads lose their coherence from the beginning .",
    "bi - directional flows along the filament axis are observed at the late phase of lal oscillations with a speed range of 1040 km s@xmath0 ( figures 4__a _ _ and _ b _ ) .",
    "these speeds are a factor of 2 greater than those of the counter - streaming flows reported before ( 520 km s@xmath0 ; zirker et al .",
    "1998 ; schmieder et al .",
    "2010 ; lin 2011 ) .",
    "since the oscillations of different filamentary threads are not synchronous , the interaction between filamentary threads is ultimately destroyed at the late phase .",
    "thus some threads have opposite movement directions , which shows the characteristic of bi - directional flows .",
    "our observations show that the bi - directional flows occur before the filament eruption , similar to the observations of lin et al .",
