    "different types of magnetic order ( differing by the relative orientation of the spins ) are possible if the unit cell of an antiferromagnet contains more than two magnetic ions .",
    "a transition from the paramagnetic phase to the phase with lowest exchange energy occurs at the nel point .",

    "quasi - one - dimensional antiferromagnets have some unique properties : first , if the order types differ only by the orientations of the spins in the directions perpendicular to the chain , the energy difference between these ordered states will be small ( of the scale of the small interchain - exchange interaction @xmath3 ) .",
    "a second peculiarity arises from the microscopic structure of low - dimensional magnets .",
    "small values of the interchain - exchange constants in inorganic compounds are frequently due to the orthogonality of the corresponding electron orbitals",
    ". since this `` 90@xmath4''-rule is not applicable to other interchain interactions , relativistic interchain interactions ( such as anisotropic or dzyaloshinskii - moriya exchange interactions ) can compete with the interchain heisenberg - exchange interaction .",
    "these features of low - dimensional magnets can result in magnetic phase transitions with a change of the exchange structure , as in the case of la@xmath0cuo@xmath5 .",
    "@xcite    the recently discovered compound bacu@xmath0si@xmath0o@xmath1 has attracted attention , since it was reported that it is a quasi - one - dimensional antiferromagnet @xcite .",

    "the susceptibility @xcite @xmath11 also demonstrates a broad maximum characteristic for one - dimensional antiferromagnets@xcite at a temperature near 200  k.    the weak interchain interaction leads to the formation of long - range antiferromagnetic order at @xmath12  k. the nel temperature is well marked by a kink in @xmath13 , indicating easy - axis ordering in low magnetic field . above @xmath14 the susceptibility demonstrates a deviation from the bonner - fisher law@xcite  @xmath13 strongly increases on approaching the nel temperature .",
    "the magnetic moment per cu - ion is strongly reduced in the ordered phase due to the effect of quantum fluctuations : according to the inelastic neutron scattering experiments@xcite @xmath15 .",
    "unexpectedly , the magnetization study in the ordered state reveals the existence of two spin - reorientation transitions at @xmath16 ( transition fields @xmath17  t and @xmath18  t).@xcite two spin - reorientation transitions are a surprising feature for a supposed - to - be - collinear antiferromagnet .",
    "usually an easy - axis antiferromagnet exhibits only one spin - reorientation transition ( spin - flop transition ) caused by the competition of the gain in magnetization energy with the loss in anisotropy energy .",
    "the observation of an additional spin - reorientation transition@xcite at @xmath19 at the field @xmath20  t is also intriguing  the classical easy - axis antiferromagnet does not undergo a spin - reorientation transition , if the external field is applied perpendicular to the easy axis of the anisotropy .",
    "neutron - scattering experiments@xcite have shown that the intermediate - field phase is noncollinear .",
    "however , the origin of these exotic spin - reorientation transitions remains a mystery .    in the present paper",
    "we perform an analysis of the phase diagram and magnetic structure of bacu@xmath0si@xmath0o@xmath1 from a macroscopic approach taking into account the symmetry of the crystal .",
    "we show that both two spin - reorientation transitions and the behavior of the susceptibility above @xmath14 are due to the unusually large relativistic terms in the thermodynamic potential .",

    "relativistic interactions leading to these distortions contribute to the corresponding relativistic constants , as it will be demonstrated in the next subsection .    following the standard procedure ,",
    "we will write down an expansion of the thermodynamic potential @xmath23 , where @xmath24 .    the potential @xmath25 is defined in such a way that@xcite    @xmath26    since magnetization appears only in the presence of a magnetic field , the potential expansion can be written via the @xmath27 and @xmath28 variables.@xcite requiring invariance of the energy to symmetry operations we obtain :    @xmath29 ^ 2+c_1({\\mathbf{l}}\\cdot\\mathbf{h})h_xl_x+\\nonumber\\\\ & & + c_2({\\mathbf{l}}\\cdot\\mathbf{h})h_yl_y+b_1l_x^2h^2+\\nonumber\\\\ & & + b_2l_y^2h^2-\\frac{\\xi_z}{2}h_z^2-\\frac{\\xi_x}{2}h_x^2-\\frac{h^2}{8\\pi}\\label{eqn : exp - oneparam}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the small parameter in this expansion is the ratio between the relativistic constants and the exchange constants .",
    "the first two terms ( @xmath30 ) describe the orthorhombic anisotropy , the terms containing @xmath31 and @xmath32 describe the exchange part of the susceptibility  they do not change under simultaneous rotation of @xmath27 and @xmath28 on the same angle . the terms with @xmath33 describe the relativistic contribution to the susceptibility which is independent on the @xmath27 orientation . of the higher order terms containing the magnetic field ,",
    "we have kept only exchange - relativistic terms which are a product of exchange part ( invariant under simultaneous rotation of @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) and relativistic part .",
    "other higher - order terms are smaller due to the supposed smallness of the relativistic constants and , thus , can be omitted .",
    "easy - axis ordering at low fields requires that @xmath34 . concerning the anisotropy terms in the expansion ( [ eqn : exp - oneparam ] ) , it is also necessary to point out that , if one ( or both ) of the anisotropy constants is equal to zero or if @xmath35 , then a consideration of the higher - order anisotropy terms would become necessary . however , there are no symmetry reasons , causing these special values of the anisotropy constants .",
    "minimization over the orientations of @xmath27 in the exact orientations of the external magnetic field demonstrates that the antiferromagnetic vector @xmath27 is aligned along one of the crystallographic axes except maybe for the narrow field interval near the reorientation transitions where its behavior would be determined by the higher - order anisotropy terms .",
    "the thermodynamic - potential expressions and magnetic susceptibilities for different possible orientations of @xmath28 and @xmath27 are given by :    * ( see fig.[fig : phi(h ) ] ) @xmath36 * @xmath37 * @xmath38    now we can find the fields of the spin - reorientation transitions by equalizing the thermodynamic potentials in the phases with different orientations of @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath39    all parameters involved can be estimated using the static magnetization data from refs .  , and the @xmath40 value from ref .  .",
    "note , however , that the samples used in the above mentioned papers were different , thus , some uncertainty is possible .",
    "the values of the parameters calculated from the 5  k data are presented in table [ tab : params ] . since @xmath41 , the hard axis of the magnetization",
    "is established along the @xmath42 direction . substituting the found values to eqn .",
    "[ eqn : h13 ] , one can ascertain that @xmath43 , i.e. a two - spin - reorientation transition scenario is more energy beneficient than a direct transition from @xmath44 to @xmath45 . the positiveness of @xmath46 explains the absence of a phase transition for @xmath47 : for @xmath48 and @xmath49 eqn .",
    "[ eqn : hc4 ] has no physical solutions .",
    "the anisotropy constants determine the gaps of the antiferromagnetic resonance spectrum @xcite .",
    "antiferromagnetic resonance on the bacu@xmath0si@xmath0o@xmath1 was studied in ref .   and two gaps given by @xmath50  ghz and @xmath51  ghz were found .",
    "the ratio of the afmr gaps can be expressed as    @xmath52    inserting the values of the anisotropy constants from table [ tab : params ] yields for this ratio @xmath53 which is in perfect agreement with the value @xmath54 found from the experiment .",
    "the absolute value of the afmr gap can be approximated @xcite as @xmath55    which is in reasonable agreement with the experiment , since a good deal of uncertainty is involved in the estimation of the exchange field @xmath56 in the case of a low - dimensional magnet .",
    "thus , expansion ( [ eqn : exp - oneparam ] ) correctly describes the observed spin - reorientation transitions and is in agreement with other experimental observations .",
    "the additional phase transitions occur as a result of the competition of anisotropy and relativistic corrections to the susceptibility .",
    "the transition at @xmath57 is a normal spin - flop transition : all spins are rotated perpendicular to the field direction and are aligned along the second - easy axis @xmath58 . at this transition",
    "the loss of the easy - axis anisotropy is compensated by the gain in magnetization energy , since @xmath59 .",
    "the second phase transition ( at @xmath60 ) is caused by the competition of the in - plane anisotropy and difference of the magnetization energy in different orientations of @xmath27 due to the relativistic corrections : the magnetic susceptibility for @xmath61 turns out to be larger than that for @xmath62 , thus , the loss of anisotropy energy is overcome by the gain in magnetization energy .",
    "the spin - reorientation transition at @xmath63 is due to the same effect : relativistic corrections to the susceptibility make the susceptibility to be the largest for @xmath61 , thus , the gain in magnetization energy overcomes the loss in anisotropy energy .",
    "note that the relativistic corrections @xmath64 and @xmath33 are unusually large in bacu@xmath0si@xmath0o@xmath1 : @xmath65 turns out to be comparable with @xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath66 terms normally should become comparable with the anisotropy constants only at magnetic fields of the scale of the exchange field .",
    "thus , a mechanism , which strongly enhances the role of the relativistic interactions , has to be found .",
    "one possibility is the effect of anisotropic reduction of the spin in different phases . according to the neutron - scattering data@xcite , the average magnetic moment of the cu ion changes as @xmath27 changes its orientation .",
    "accounting for this effect would result in the same exchange - relativistic terms in the thermodynamic - potential expansion .",
    "another possible reason for the large values of these constants will be discussed in the next section .",
    "it is necessary to recall that the above expansion of the thermodynamic potential was performed assuming the relativistic contributions to be small compared to the exchange part .",
    "hence , higher - order terms have been neglected .",
    "however , in principle the increasing importance of the relativistic interactions should also lead to an increase of the higher - order terms , which especially would affect the phase transitions at higher fields ( @xmath60 , @xmath40 ) .",
    "moreover , this should give rise to other effects , such as a nonlinearity of the magnetization , which has not been reported yet .",
    "we also have to note another possible explanation of the comparable magnitude of the fields @xmath57 and @xmath60 : namely that , if @xmath35 , then eqn.[eqn : hc2 ] becomes ill - defined .",
    "as it was noted earlier , in this case higher - order ( fourth - order ) anisotropy terms have to be considered , and higher - order anisotropy constants ( containing additional relativistic smallness , compared to @xmath67 ) would appear in the numerator of eqn.[eqn : hc2 ] .",
    "the @xmath66 terms should become comparable with the fourth - order anisotropy terms in fields of the order of the normal spin - flop field @xmath57 .",
    "however , we would like to point out again that there are no symmetry reasons causing the equivalence of the anisotropy constants , and the values of the @xmath68 and @xmath69 constants derived from the experimental data are almost four - fold different . a microscopic consideration of the interspin interactions , which is beyond of the scope of the present paper , is necessary to check this probability in detail .",
    "the angular dependence of the transition field @xmath60 also has to contain information on whether second- or fourth - order anisotropy terms are responsible for the additional spin - reorientation transition .",
    "nevertheless , the present experimental results can be consistently explained in the framework of our simplified approach .",
    "therefore , it seems to be reasonable to start again with the assumption of small relativistic contributions in the following refinement of the thermodynamic potential with the aim to analyze the magnetic structure in detail .",
    "relativistic interactions , such as the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction , can cause small distortions of the collinear structure , which can be expressed by magnetic vectors .",
    "these distortions , however , have to be compatible with the crystal symmetry .",
    "this means that the components of the magnetic vectors corresponding to the distortions in the given phase have to transform in the same way as the corresponding component of the main magnetic vector , i.e. they have to belong to the same representation of the symmetry group .",
    "the possible types of canting of the spins can be easily found from table [ table : sametrans ] .",
    "we will consider here only distortions described by the magnetic vectors @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , for only these magnetic vectors correspond to the antiferromagnetic in - chain order .",
    "other distortions would lead to a violation of the in - chain antiferromagnetic ordering and , therefore , they are strongly suppressed by the strong in - chain exchange interaction .",
    "thus , we obtain    * phase i ( @xmath73 ) + no canting is allowed by symmetry * phase ii ( @xmath74 ) + @xmath75 is allowed * phase iii ( @xmath76 ) + @xmath77 is allowed    the structure of the magnetic phases is shown in figure [ fig : noncoll ] .",
    "note that the proposed structure is different from that of ref .",
    ", where canting described by the magnetic vector @xmath71 was proposed . however , vector @xmath71 has components transforming in the same way as the magnetization , i.e. distortions described by the components of @xmath71 can be induced by the magnetic field .    to find the amplitudes of the distortions we have to write an expansion of the thermodynamic potential including vectors @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 and then to minimize this potential with respect to the components of these vectors . in this expansion",

    "are possible , but they are induced by the external field and they are independent on the orientation of the main antiferromagnetic vector .",
    "thus , they have to be observed in all phases .",
    "moreover , their amplitude should increase with increasing magnetic field , while according to the findings of ref .",
    "the noncollinearity is suppressed by the magnetic field in phase ii .    on the other hand ,",
    "the distortions described by the components of @xmath86 are consistent with the experimental observations : they are absent in phase i , and their amplitude in phases ii and iii are governed by different constants @xmath82 . the fact that the canting in phase iii is much smaller than in phase ii",
