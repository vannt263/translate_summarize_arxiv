    "understanding the transport of angular momentum in accretion disks is one of the basic challenges in modern astrophysics .",
    "the traditional approach ( @xcite ) is to assume that accretion disks are characterized by an effective viscosity , arising from an unspecified collective process , given by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the local sound speed , @xmath5 is the disk half - thickness , and @xmath6 is a constant of order unity .",
    "more recently , there has been the realization ( @xcite ) that a previously discovered magnetic field instability in a shearing flow ( @xcite , @xcite ) will act to produce a positive angular momentum flux in an accretion disk .",
    "this has given rise to two separate , but related claims .",
    "the first is the proposal that this is the dominant mechanism of angular momentum transport in ionized accretion disks .",
    "the second is the proposal that this instability , by itself , leads to a turbulent dynamo which drives the magnetic field into equipartition with the ambient pressure , i.e. @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the alfvn speed in the disk . the growth rate for this dynamo is usually taken , following the original claim of balbus and hawley , to be @xmath9 .",
    "since the dimensionless ` viscosity ' , @xmath6 , is @xmath10 , this proposal requires that @xmath6 be a number ` of order unity ' .",
    "however , we need to interpret this phrase generously . in numerical simulations",
    "( e.g. @xcite ) @xmath6 is less than @xmath11 both because the magnetic pressure saturates at a fraction of the gas pressure , and because the off - diagonal components of @xmath12 are a fraction of @xmath13 .",
    "three dimensional simulations of the balbus - hawley instability have been performed by a variety of researchers , with and without imposed vertical magnetic flux , and with and without vertical disk structure ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "we note in particular brandenburg et al .",
    "( 1995 ) in which no net flux was imposed on the computational box , and vertical disk structure was included . in this simulation , as in the others , there was an initial rise in the magnetic energy density at a rate @xmath9 . at the end of this phase",
    "the system had not yet lost memory of its initial conditions , but after a somewhat longer time , which may be as long as a few dozen rotation periods , the simulation asymptotically approached a final state with @xmath7 .",
    "the approach to this state was characterized by the appearance of a large scale field which underwent spontaneous reversals at irregular intervals of tens of rotational periods .",
    "interestingly , the presence of a large scale coherent field does not seem to be due to an @xmath14 dynamo , because the relative helicity is just a few percent .",
    "conventional @xmath14 dynamo models rely on a nonzero @xmath15 component in the helicity tensor ( not to be confused with the dimensionless viscosity , written here as @xmath6 ) to produce a large scale coherent field .",
    "the presence of an initial rapid rise is less surprising , since imposing a uniform large scale magnetic field in a turbulent medium results in the formation of intermittent magnetic field structures and a consequent rise in the magnetic energy density at the turbulent eddy turn - over rate .",
    "in addition , there is evidence ( @xcite ) that turbulence in a conducting fluid can generate a modest and highly disordered magnetic field even in the absence of an imposed global field .",
    "both of these effects are probably due to the ability of of symmetric turbulence to produce a negative effective diffusion coefficient ( @xcite ) and they both can be relied open to contribute to the growth of the high wavenumber component of the magnetic field . on the other hand , the slower relaxation rate seen after the initial rise",
    "is correlated with changes in the large scale field and is presumably an indicator of the large scale dynamo growth rate .",
    "since the turbulence is sustained by an instability of the large scale field , its ability to generate such a field is critically important .",
    "the saturation level of the magnetic field in these simulations also leads to some puzzling questions .",
    "the claim that the balbus - hawley instability saturates when the magnetic pressure is comparable to the ambient thermal pressure , and that the dimensionless viscosity has some approximately fixed value , is difficult to reconcile with attempts to model accretion disks in compact binary systems .",
    "successful models of dwarf novae outbursts and x - ray transients ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and , more recently , @xcite ) , as well as the distribution of light in quiescent dwarf novae disks ( @xcite ) all imply that the dimensionless viscosity , @xmath6 , varies spatially and with time .",
    "these variations are consistent with @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a constant lying somewhere between @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "recent work ( @xcite ) on x - ray transients suggests that @xmath17 may be close to @xmath20 .",
    "here we note only that any value of @xmath17 appreciably different from zero conflicts with claims for a universal value of @xmath6 .",
    "this difficulty can be resolved in several different ways .",
    "for example , we might claim that magnetic instabilities dominate @xmath6 only at low temperatures and that some other process , e.g. convection , dominates at higher temperatures .",
    "this idea faces two major objections .",
    "first , it explains only some of the phenomenological evidence favoring a varying @xmath6 .",
    "second , attempts to model the vertical structure of dwarf novae disks invariably conclude that such disks are convective during quiescence , when @xmath6 is small and stably stratified during outburst , when @xmath6 is relatively large ( for a recent discussion of the conditions necessary for convection in partially ionized accretion disks see cannizzo 1992 ) .",
    "this implies that convection could explain the rise in @xmath6 only if it acts to suppress angular momentum transport , rather than enhance it .",
    "alternatively , one could appeal to the temperature dependence of the resistivity to account for this effect , although the effective resistivity of the simulations is , in any case , many orders of magnitude larger than in real disks .",
    "a more promising notion is that one might ascribe the rise in @xmath6 to the greater thermal conductivity of disk in the hot state , although the rationale for this is not yet clear . finally , one might simply conclude that all the phenomenological models are wrong , for a variety of reasons , a viewpoint which is difficult to dismiss given the large uncertainties faced in modeling accretion disks .    in this paper we will explore a new turbulent disk dynamo in which the turbulence is not assumed to lack mirror symmetry in the vertical direction .",
    "the dynamo effect arises from the fact that in a system of finite size the mean square helicity , and the instantaneous spatially averaged helicity , is still nonzero .",
    "we will see that this leads to the existence of a modified @xmath14 dynamo , in which the large scale organization of the magnetic field comes from the existence of a large scale shear .",
    "of course , a real disk has vertical structure , which breaks the vertical symmetry and allows for the _ possibility _ of a nonzero average helicity .",
    "however , we will show that the incoherent dynamo mechanism will be particularly effective in simulations of limited azimuthal extent . indeed the simulations of brandenburg et al .",
    "( 1995 ) show that while the relative helicity is small ( less than a few percent ) , there is still a dynamo effect leading to the generation of large scale fields . moreover",
    ", the saturation level of the magnetic field , and the consequent value of @xmath6 , turn out to depend sensitively on the ratio @xmath21 . if this dynamo is the only effect to arise from the turbulence induced by the balbus - hawley effect , then it is relatively simple to reconcile the dynamo activity seen in simulations with phenomenological models of accretion disks in compact binary systems .    in  2",
    "we discuss the conceptual basis of an incoherent dynamo in a turbulent shearing medium and estimate the growth rate . in ",
    "3 we apply this to accretion disks and show that the incoherent dynamo gives a positive growth rate only for axisymmetric magnetic domains .",
    "we estimate the saturated state of the field and discuss our results in light of numerical simulations of magnetic fields in a keplerian disk . in ",
    "4 we summarize our results and their implications for astrophysical disks and numerical simulations of such disks .",
    "in a highly conducting medium the magnetic field obeys the induction equation @xmath22 where we have neglected ohmic diffusion .",
    "ultimately this term is important in allowing reconnection and smoothing .",
    "here we assume that these processes take place at a rate determined by turbulent processes .",
    "the usual approach to dynamo theory is to define the response of the large scale magnetic field to small scale motions as @xmath23 and to derive its effects on the large scale field by substituting @xmath23 back into the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : ind ] ) . for an incompressible fluid this yields @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the levi - civita tensor and @xmath26 and @xmath27 the first term comes from the stretching of large scale field lines by the local turbulence .",
    "the tensor @xmath28 describes the twisting of large scale field lines into a spiral shape .",
    "reconnection between adjacent spirals produces a large scale field component at right angles to the original field line provided that either the degree of twisting or the large scale magnetic field strength varies in the third direction .",
    "the second term is the usual diffusion term , modified by the presence of the third term .",
    "we can see from equation ( [ eq : alpha ] ) that each component of @xmath29 has either a factor of @xmath30 or @xmath31 . if the local velocity field is mirror symmetric , in the sense that its statistical properties are unchanged under the transformation @xmath32 , then the time and space averaged value of @xmath29 vanishes .",
    "this poses a significant but , as we will see , not insurmountable , obstacle to a successful dynamo .",
    "another problem is that equations ( [ eq : dyn1 ] ) , ( [ eq : alpha ] ) and ( [ eq : diff ] ) are usually defined kinematically , i.e. the velocity field is assumed to be imposed on the magnetic field .",
    "once the magnetic field becomes sufficiently powerful it will modify the flow , which is usually taken into account by including a correction term proportional to @xmath33 .",
    "however , in a keplerian shearing flow the magnetic field will be unstable and the resulting turbulence will be directly correlated with the magnetic field .",
    "nevertheless , as long as we define @xmath34 in terms of the motion of the magnetic field lines equation ( [ eq : dyn1 ] ) will remain valid , if difficult to solve . here",
    "we will define our results in terms of the properties of @xmath29 and @xmath35 regardless of their ultimate source .    in a keplerian disk",
    "the dynamo equations can be simplified as @xmath36 and @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the rotation frequency , @xmath39 is the buoyant velocity of the magnetic field lines relative to the surrounding fluid , and @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the radial and azimuthal components of the magnetic field .",
    "equations ( [ eq : br ] ) and ( [ eq : bt ] ) differ from equation ( [ eq : dyn1 ] ) in that we have allowed for the presence of global shearing , and magnetic field line buoyancy .",
    "in addition , we have assumed that the diffusion matrix is diagonal , and dropped the effects of helicity on the evolution of @xmath41 , given that the shearing of @xmath40 should dominate such effects .",
    "also , we have retained only the @xmath15 term in equation ( [ eq : br ] ) since the critical feedback term in the dynamo equations involves generating radial magnetic flux from the azimuthal component of the field .",
    "finally , given that we are interested in applying these equations to accretion disks whose thickness is a small fraction of their radius , we have assumed that vertical gradients will dominate over radial gradients .",
    "now let s assume that the turbulence is symmetric under @xmath32 so that @xmath42 .",
    "although this eliminates any coherent helicity , the value of @xmath43 can still increase in a random walk . ignoring diffusion and buoyancy",
    "we see that the formal solution for @xmath40 is @xmath44 now by hypothesis , @xmath15 is uncorrelated over time scales greater than some eddy correlation time @xmath45 . if the radial magnetic field is undergoing a random walk , then it will usually be far enough away from zero that it will not change sign every eddy correlation time .",
    "since @xmath40 drives @xmath41 through coherent shearing , this implies that the correlation time for @xmath40 and @xmath41 is much greater than @xmath45 .",
    "consequently , we can consider the integrand in equation ( [ eq : tvar ] ) as consisting of a rapidly varying factor , @xmath15 , multiplying a slowly varying function .",
    "multiplying equation ( [ eq : tvar ] ) times equation ( [ eq : br ] ) and ignoring diffusion and buoyancy , as before , we see that the integral in equation ( [ eq : tvar ] ) is correlated with @xmath15 only over the last eddy correlation time @xmath45 .",
    "consequently , we can replace the integral in the product with @xmath46 .",
    "this implies @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the number of independent turbulent eddies in a magnetic domain , @xmath49 is the vertical wavenumber of the magnetic domain , and @xmath50 is the mean square helicity associated with a single eddy . in general this will be of order @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the root mean square turbulent velocity .",
    "since @xmath40 is being driven incoherently we can expect it to undergo frequent reversals . in between such reversals",
    "the shearing of the field will drive @xmath13 sharply upward . from equations ( [ eq : bt ] ) and ( [ eq : ran1 ] ) we see that the correlation time of the radial magnetic field and the growth time of the magnetic field are comparable and given by @xmath53 we note that @xmath54 has to be greater than @xmath45 in order for this estimate to be internally self - consistent , i.e. the magnetic field must be correlated over longer times than the turbulence itself . since a field reversal in @xmath41 requires that @xmath40 not only reverse its sign , but maintain it long enough to push @xmath41 through zero , it is clear that the correlation time for @xmath41 may be somewhat larger than the correlation time for @xmath40 .",
    "we will return to this point later .    by itself",
    "this argument does not show that a succession of random twists in a shearing background can drive an exponential increase in the magnetic field .",
    "we need to show that the growth experienced between field reversals dominates over the abrupt cancellation of the field as @xmath40 reverses itself .",
    "we also need to show that our estimate of the growth rate given in equation ( [ eq : gr1 ] ) will dominate over turbulent diffusion for some range of magnetic domain sizes .",
    "we can test the assertion that a series of random changes in @xmath40 can drive a dynamo by constructing a simple toy model of the process , which ignores the spatial structure of the field , but includes its dynamical evolution . assuming that @xmath15 has a stochastic component and ignoring buoyancy we can rewrite equations ( [ eq : br ] ) and ( [ eq : bt ] ) as @xmath55 and @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a stochastic variable with a correlation time @xmath45 and @xmath58 is the coherent component of @xmath59 . here",
    "we have subsumed spatial derivatives into the definitions of @xmath60 and @xmath61 and ignored the @xmath62 term which would normally appear in the mean - field dynamo equations .",
    "we have also assumed that turbulent damping is the same for each component of the magnetic field , which is not generally true , but simplifies the analysis without losing any essential physics .",
    "equations ( [ eq : tbr ] ) and ( [ eq : tbt ] ) can be rewritten in a more convenient form by defining @xmath63 .",
    "then @xmath64 and @xmath65 the magnetic field will grow exponentially if @xmath66 is negative and @xmath67 .",
    "we can find @xmath66 by solving equation ( [ eq : stoch ] ) in terms of an unnormalized probability distribution function @xmath68 and evaluating @xmath69 the distribution function @xmath68 satisfies the equation @xmath70 or @xmath71 where we have taken advantage of the unnormalized nature of @xmath68 to set the constant of integration to @xmath72 . equation ( [ eq : distev ] ) can be solved to yield @xmath73 \\int_a^{\\infty}\\exp\\left[{-\\omega r^3 + 2\\alpha_{coh}r\\over 2\\langle \\eta^2\\tau_{eddy}\\rangle}\\right]dr .",

    "this will be suppressed by turbulent diffusion only when the damping rate due to diffusion is comparable to the growth rate .",
    "the existence of an incoherent dynamo emerges from the fact that the distribution function @xmath68 given in equation ( [ eq : pdist ] ) is biased towards negative values of @xmath84 .",
    "this bias comes , paradoxically enough , from the coherent , positive definite term in equation ( [ eq : stoch ] ) .",
    "when @xmath84 is sufficiently positive it evolves deterministically through @xmath85 into negative values .",
    "( actually , @xmath40 does nt change during this phase .",
    "this deterministic trajectory is merely a field reversal for @xmath41 . )",
    "the end result is that whenever @xmath84 becomes large and positive it rapidly switches to being large and negative .",
    "ultimately , the sign of the bias is determined by the sign of @xmath86 .",
    "the frequency of such field reversals is given by examining the probability distribution at large @xmath84 when the evolution of @xmath68 is deterministic .",
    "if we define @xmath87 as the time it takes for the field to move from some large positive value of @xmath84 to @xmath88 then from equation ( [ eq : stoch ] ) we see that @xmath89 where we have neglected @xmath58 since for @xmath84 sufficiently large its effects can be ignored .",
    "the field reversal rate is just the limit of this rate times the statistical weight of the distribution between @xmath84 and @xmath90 . in other words ,",
    "@xmath91 substituting equations ( [ eq : pdist ] ) and ( [ eq : taua ] ) into this result , and making the change of variables , as before , to @xmath92 and @xmath78 we have @xmath93dw dx\\over \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty\\int_0^\\infty \\exp\\left [ w\\left(\\gamma-{1\\over4}(w^2 + 3x^2)\\right)\\right]dw dx}.\\ ] ] both the numerator and the denominator can be simplified by integrating over @xmath92 to obtain @xmath94dw}. \\label{eq : trev}\\ ] ] when @xmath80 is small this becomes @xmath95 i.e. a rate which is roughly half the e - folding rate for the magnetic field energy .    when @xmath58 is large and positive we can evaluate the integrals in equation ( [ eq : exact ] ) by expanding around the maximum of @xmath96 .",
    "we obtain @xmath97 so that @xmath98 which is the expected result for a coherent @xmath14 dynamo . in this limit the magnetic field reversal rate becomes @xmath99.\\ ] ] as expected , field reversals are exponentially suppressed as we go to the usual @xmath14 dynamo . given @xmath100 then as @xmath58 becomes significant we expect it to enhance the dynamo growth rate and reduce the rate of spontaneous field reversals .",
    "when @xmath58 is large and negative we can evaluate equation ( [ eq : exact ] ) by integrating the denominator by parts and remembering that the bulk of the contribution to the integral comes from @xmath101 so that @xmath102 .",
    "we obtain @xmath103 and @xmath104 in this limit field reversals occur at a rate given by @xmath105 we note that in this case the coherent component of the helicity does not completely shut off the incoherent dynamo , even though by itself it is incapable of driving a dynamo .",
    "instead we find that as @xmath106 increases past one the dynamo growth rate decreases inversely with @xmath106 .",
    "eventually , turbulent diffusion will suppress the dynamo .",
    "in the limit where @xmath80 is of order @xmath107 we anticipate that the dynamo growth rate will be less than expected from the incoherent dynamo alone and the rate of field reversals will be larger .",
    "these analytic results have the advantage of being based on a solvable model , but do not include the effects of spatial structure or saturation .",
    "it is therefore instructive to consider the combined effects of a random electromotive force and shear in a one dimensional model .",
    "we consider the mean field equations for a uniform disk with keplerian rotation and half - thickness @xmath108 , @xmath109 @xmath110 with @xmath111 and @xmath112 at @xmath113 .",
    "we first consider the incoherent @xmath114-effect , so we take @xmath114 to be random in space and time .",
    "when the rms value of @xmath114 is large enough we find self - excited solutions that grow without bound . in reality",
    "there must be some quenching mechanism , which we model using @xmath115 where @xmath116 is a random function in space and time with zero mean and an rms value of unity . without loss of generality we put @xmath117 .    in fig .",
    "1 we plot contours of the @xmath41 field in a space - time diagram for a dynamo number @xmath118 of @xmath119 .",
    "( the critical dynamo number for dynamo action depends on the coherence time and length scales , @xmath120 and @xmath121 , respectively . in the present case",
    "we adopt @xmath122 and @xmath123 and find the critical dynamo number to be around 2000 . at this dynamo number",
    "the ratio of the growth rate given in equation ( [ eq : gr1 ] ) to @xmath124 is @xmath125 . )",
    "the remarkable result is that the @xmath41 field shows a great deal of spatio - temporal coherence with variations comparable to the diffusion time and diffusion length .",
    "experiments with different dynamo numbers suggest that the degree of coherence is more pronounced for larger dynamo numbers .    in order to isolate the effect of a spatially incoherent @xmath114-effect we now investigate a model with a steady @xmath114-effect of the form @xmath126 for large values of @xmath17 , the critical dynamo number is proportional to @xmath127 .",
    "thus , although the rms value of the @xmath114-effect is unchanged , the dynamo becomes harder to excite if @xmath114 is chopped into many domains of different sign .",
    "the magnetic field is steady , and the radial component is of alternating sign .",
    "however , more surprisingly , the toroidal magnetic field has the same sign for all values of @xmath128 , see fig .",
    "this is very similar to the simulation of a random incoherent @xmath114-effect mentioned before .",
    "there is one difference in that the magnetic field shows global reversals in time when the @xmath114-effect is incoherent in time .",
    "finally , we note that in order for the magnetic field to grow the growth rate given in equation ( [ eq : gr1 ] ) has to be greater than the dissipation rate . in general",
    "the dissipation rate will depend on the wavenumber of the magnetic domain as @xmath129 , while the growth rate goes as @xmath130 . clearly whether or not there is a self - excited dynamo will depend in large part on the geometry of the fluid .",
    "a keplerian accretion disk with a root mean square alfvn speed of @xmath8 will be subject a local instability first described by velikhov ( 1959 ) .",
    "its pivotal role in transporting angular momentum outward in accretion disks was recognized later ( @xcite ) . in the context of accretion disks",
    "this instability is normally referred to as the balbus - hawley instability .",
    "its maximum growth rate is of order @xmath131 , and occurs at an azimuthal wavelength of @xmath132 . in three dimensions the instability saturates in turbulence with a typical turbulent velocity comparable to @xmath8 and a typical eddy size of @xmath132 .",
    "this turbulence is not expected to be isotropic , but the typical eddies are expected to have axis ratios of order unity , which in this context means only that no axis should be more than an order of magnitude larger than another ( @xcite ) . numerical simulations ( @xcite ) indicate that the the azimuthal scale of the typical eddies is several times the vertical and radial scales , which is expected in light of the large local shear .",
    "the azimuthal velocity is also larger , although only by a factor of roughly two .",
    "neglecting such factors , these scaling laws imply a turbulent diffusivity of @xmath133 .",
    "the turbulence largely suppresses the parker instability and the typical buoyant velocity of the magnetic field is of order @xmath134 ( @xcite , @xcite ) , where @xmath4 is the local sound speed . the angular momentum flux induced by the turbulence is approximately @xmath135 which implies a dimensionless viscosity @xmath6 of order @xmath136 . since @xmath137 this implies that magnetic flux is lost from the disk at a rate which is some fraction of order unity times @xmath138 .",
    "it is by no means obvious that in real disks this turbulence possesses the kind of symmetry that would make @xmath42 . on the other hand , calculations done without vertical structure or",
    "any imposed large scale field ( @xcite ) give results which are qualitatively similar to calculations which include vertical structure ( @xcite ) . by construction",
    "the former calculations must be symmetric under the transformation @xmath32 even though the latter are not .",
    "we can in principle estimate @xmath15 using data from the simulation of brandenburg et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . from equation ( [ eq : alpha ] )",
    "it is clear that a time integration has to be carried out .",
    "however , video animations of those data suggest that the life time of turbulent eddies is shorter than the life time of magnetic structures which , in turn , is shorter than the eddy turn over time . in other words ,",
    "the strouhal number ( e.g. krause & rdler 1980 ) is small . as a rough approximation we may therefore replace the time integration by a multiplication with a relevant time scale .",
    "we adopt the natural time scale @xmath139 , which is sufficient since we are only interested in relative variations .",
    "we adopt volume averages and note that because of the periodic boundary conditions in the toroidal direction , @xmath140 , so we can compute @xmath141 in fig .",
    "3 we plot the evolution of @xmath15 using the data from run c of brandenburg et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , which has now been carried out for an additional 200 orbits , see also torkelsson et al .",
    "this average was computed for the upper half plane of the simulation .",
    "we note that @xmath15 is positive , in agreement with the expected effect for bubbles that expand as they rise in a keplerian disk . however , the sign of @xmath15 suggested by the correlation between the azimuthal magnetic and electric fields is negative ( @xcite ) .",
    "the source of this discrepancy is not yet clear . in any case",
    "the spatially averaged helicity shows large variations from its long term average , although the variations in the electromotive force are much larger .",
    "the size of the fluctuations in the electromotive force , as well as the persistence of the dynamo in the absence of any @xmath142 symmetry breaking , implies that any preferred helicity resulting from vertical structure is not strong enough to completely dominate the simulations .",
    "in what follows we will assume that real disks lack any significant @xmath143 .",
    "at a minimum our results can be taken as demonstrating that there is an incoherent dynamo operating in the simulations , and in real accretion disks , whose effects need to be understood , and cleanly separated from any other dynamo mechanisms at work .",
    "let s consider a magnetic domain characterized by the wavenumbers @xmath144 . ignoring the anisotropies in the turbulence",
    "we find that the number of turbulent eddies per domain is roughly @xmath145 .",
    "consequently the growth rate for the dynamo is @xmath146 however , in a shearing environment we are nt free to specify @xmath147 and @xmath148 separately .",
    "the shear implies a minimum @xmath147 for any @xmath148 since in a time @xmath149 the shear will increase @xmath147 by an amount @xmath150 .",
    "if we choose a value of @xmath147 above this minimal value then @xmath151 will go as @xmath152 while the dissipation rate scales as @xmath153 .",
    "clearly our chances for a successful dynamo will be maximized by taking @xmath154 .",
    "this gives us @xmath155 this analysis only makes sense in the limit where the magnetic domains encompass at least one eddy , or @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "the dissipation rate is roughly @xmath158 by comparing equations ( [ eq : nax1 ] ) and ( [ eq : diss ] ) we see that the incoherent dynamo is incapable of generating non - axisymmetric large scale magnetic fields .",
    "the dissipation rate of such domains exceeds the generation rate for all domain sizes greater than a single eddy .    in a real disk",
    "the number of eddies in a magnetic domain does not increase indefinitely as @xmath159 .",
    "the finite circumference of the disk implies that for axisymmetric domains @xmath160 consequently , we can rewrite equation([eq : grge ] ) as @xmath161 at a fixed wavenumber , and therefore at a fixed dissipation rate , this rate is maximized for @xmath162 . assuming this ratio we see that the dynamo growth rate for axisymmetric domains goes as @xmath163 , which implies that at some sufficiently small @xmath164 the dynamo will work .",
    "more exactly , the incoherent dynamo caused by the balbus - hawley instability will drive an increase in the magnetic field strength if @xmath165 in other words , the incoherent dynamo only works for @xmath166    ultimately @xmath49 is limited by the height of the disk , i.e. @xmath167 . moreover , as we approach this limit the buoyant loss of magnetic flux becomes significant .",
    "the buoyant loss rate from a single magnetic domain goes as @xmath168 so when @xmath169 buoyant losses are as important as turbulent diffusion . of course , the only limit on the radial extent of a magnetic domain is @xmath170 , but lowering @xmath147 past @xmath171 will lower the growth rate without affecting the dissipation rate . from equation ( [ eq : blim ] )",
    "we see that the magnetic field associated with scales of order the disk thickness will be the strongest and will be given by @xmath172 this in turn implies that the dimensionless viscosity associated with this dynamo mechanism is @xmath173 we expect this scaling law to hold only in the limit @xmath174 . as @xmath175 corrections of order @xmath176",
    "will become important in our formula for buoyancy . since the saturation limit for the magnetic field involves the small difference between the growth rate dependence on @xmath8 , which has an exponent of @xmath177 , and the buoyant loss rate dependence , which goes as @xmath178",
    ", we expect the saturation strength of the magnetic field to be extremely sensitive to such corrections unless @xmath179 .",
    "we also note that the disk radius enters into this result only through its role as the circumference of an annulus .",
    "computer simulations typically involve a short arc in place of a full annulus . in this case",
    "the azimuthal length of the simulation has to be used in place of @xmath1 in equation ( [ eq : alpha1 ] ) .",
    "the rate of spontaneous magnetic reversals expected in the absence of any coherent component to @xmath15 is comparable to dynamo growth rate .",
    "however , while current simulations seem to show a significant reversal rate in the presence of vertical structure ( @xcite ) , in its absence the field can evolve for 100 orbital times without reversing ( @xcite ) . the exact relationship between the dynamo growth rate and the field reversal rate dependent on the particular model for the process , and the zero dimensional model used in this paper",
    "may well overestimate the rate of spontaneous field reversals . nevertheless , such reversals are an intrinsic part of the model , and should occur if the simulation is run for several growth times .",
    "the sharp rise in the field reversal rate when vertical structure is included suggests that a significant coherent @xmath15 is present in the such simulations .",
    "( in the zero dimensional model this would argue for a negative vertical gradient in the coherent @xmath15 .",
    "the situation is less clear in three spatial dimensions . ) in order for this helicity to allow the buildup of a coherent field in these simulations , as well as in accretion disks , it has to scale with the local rms turbulent velocity more steeply than the square of the incoherent dynamo growth rate , or @xmath180 .",
    "if this helicity is due to the parker instability and if , as has been argued elsewhere ( @xcite ) , the balbus - hawley instability reduces the parker instability to vertical motions of order @xmath181 , then we can estimate the magnitude of the helicity as @xmath182 where @xmath183 is the correlation time for these buoyant motions . since shearing imposes the requirement that @xmath184 and since these motions are approximately incompressible",
    ", i.e. @xmath185 , this gives a helicity less than @xmath186 if the coherent helicity has this dependence , then it becomes important only as the dynamo saturates due to turbulent mixing and buoyancy . in this case",
    "it will not suppress the incoherent dynamo in simulations with smaller @xmath187 , or in real accretion disks , but it will remain significant in the saturated state .",
    "the fact that the buoyancy does not significantly enhance the loss of magnetic flux is a critical element in the derivation of equation ( [ eq : alpha1 ] ) .",
    "consequently , environments that increase magnetic buoyancy will saturate at much lower field strengths .",
    "as an example we can consider magnetic flux tubes in a radiation pressure dominated environment . in this case we have ( @xcite ) @xmath188 combining this result with equation ( [ eq : gra1 ] ) for @xmath189 yields @xmath190    the exponent given in equation ( [ eq : alpha2 ] ) is perhaps a bit large in comparison to the value suggested by the phenomenology of disks , but this is a considerably less serious problem than if it were too small .",
    "competing dynamo mechanisms and/or hydrodynamic angular momentum transport mechanisms could be driving @xmath6 up . how does this compare to other sources of viscosity in disks ?",
    "the result given in equation ( [ eq : alpha2 ] ) has an extremely uncertain coefficient .",
    "current numerical simulations give @xmath6 of order @xmath11 or less , which would suggest that this coefficient is very small . on the other hand ,",
    "these simulations have @xmath7 and are definitely not in the asymptotic regime where our scaling laws should be valid .",
    "we have already noted that the small difference in the exponent of @xmath8 in the dynamo growth rate and the dissipation rate , coupled to the presence of corrections to both these rates of order @xmath176 , makes it difficult to extrapolate from current results .",
    "if the saturation value of @xmath191 approaches its asymptotic dependence on @xmath21 gradually as @xmath192 then the final value of the coefficient will be much larger than @xmath11 .",
    "bearing in mind the large role that numerical viscosity plays in the simulations ( @xcite ) it seems prudent to regard the coefficient as an unknown numerical constant .    on the other hand , since @xmath174 for many realistic disks we can compare this dynamo mechanism to others based purely on the value of the exponent in the scaling relationship .",
    "of course , a purely local mechanism _",
    "coherent _ mechanism will not scale with @xmath187 at all , although it might show some dependence on the local disk temperature .",
    "however , as we noted earlier this model seems to conflict with phenomenological studies of dwarf novae and x - ray transients .",
    "internal waves , excited by tidal instabilities in binary system disks ( @xcite ) will produce an effective @xmath6 which scales as @xmath193 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this will be a competing mechanism for angular momentum transport in gas pressure dominated disks , and potentially the dominant one in radiation pressure dominated disks .",
    "( although , such conditions are most likely in agn disks , where the potential for the tidal excitation of waves is less certain . )",
    "given the nonlocal nature of the angular momentum transport mediated by internal waves , the existence of a purely local mechanism might be important , even if it does not clearly dominate .",
    "when the disk is ionized and when internal waves are present , then the waves are capable of driving a dynamo with a growth rate @xmath194 ( @xcite ) and perhaps faster , depending on the nature of the turbulent cascade of wave energy ( @xcite )",
    ". the resulting value of @xmath6 will be @xmath195 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "when these conditions are met this would appear to be a more important dynamo mechanism , although once again we note that nonlocal effects on the wave - driven dynamo make the two processes somewhat incommensurate .",
    "an equivalent estimate based on purely local physics was given by meyer & meyer - hoffmeister ( 1983 ) .",
    "however , this estimate is based on using large scale buoyant cells driven by magnetic buoyancy , a picture which is inconsistent with turbulence in the disk ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in addition , they assumed approximate isotropy of the helicity tensor and offered a calculation of @xmath196 instead of @xmath15 .",
    "this assumption of isotropy is inconsistent with the notion that the motions are driven by magnetic buoyancy , which for @xmath174 will have a time scale much longer than the local shearing time scale .",
    "finally , we note that our result for the incoherent dynamo in an accretion disk is sensitive to our assumption that the process must be self - exciting .",
    "given an external source of fluid turbulence , e.g. convection or the turbulent cascade of energy set off by finite - amplitude internal waves , the incoherent dynamo may have a significantly larger growth rate and give rise to a larger @xmath6 .",
    "in this paper we have shown that mean - field dynamo theory allows for the existence of a new kind of @xmath14 dynamo , which we have named the incoherent @xmath14 dynamo , in which there is no coherent helicity whatsoever . in this class of dynamos the magnetic field is driven by a combination of a random walk for @xmath40 and its shearing , which creates @xmath41 .",
    "the resultant large scale field derives its organization from coherent shearing effects , rather than any loss of mirror symmetry in the turbulence .",
    "although this kind of dynamo necessarily includes spontaneous field reversals , such reversals may occur at a rate which is some fraction of the dynamo growth rate .",
    "the existence of a mean - field dynamo in a flow with a mean helicity of zero is interesting for its own sake , since it provides an example of how large scale order in the magnetic field can arise from the interaction between a large scale shear and statistically symmetric local motions . in this sense",
    "it represents an alternative to models which seek to explain dynamo activity through asymmetric turbulence and a coherent helicity .",
    "it differs from previous attempts to do without a coherent helicity ( e.g. montgomery et al .",
    "( 1984 ) and gilbert et al .",
    "( 1988 ) ) in that it does so without appealing to the other terms in equation ( [ eq : dyn1 ] ) .",
    "this model is particular interesting in light of previous claims ( @xcite ) that the coherent @xmath114 effect does not converge ( although see kraichnan ( 1979 ) for a counterargument ) .",
    "this dynamo is particularly interesting in light of simulations of magnetic field instabilities in accretion disks .",
    "we have suggested that this dynamo can operate successfully in accretion disks , but only to produce axisymmetric large scale fields . comparing the growth rate for this dynamo with the buoyant loss rate for magnetic flux",
    ", we see that _ if _ this is the only dynamo associated with magnetic shearing instabilities , then the large scale magnetic field will saturate when @xmath197 and @xmath198 .",
    "this result may seem somewhat odd , since the dynamic equations do not depend on @xmath1 at all .",
    "however , the factor of @xmath1 comes in through geometrical considerations , i.e. from considering the number of independent eddies in an axisymmetric magnetic field domain . in that sense",
    "it refers to the circumference of such an annulus rather than its radius .",
    "consequently , when comparing numerical simulations to the predictions of this model one should substitute the azimuthal extent of the simulations for @xmath1 . for current simulations",
    "this gives @xmath199 .",
    "in fact , since the turbulent eddies are longer in the azimuthal direction , the number of independent eddies that can be stacked end to end in current simulations is one or two , so that effectively @xmath200 .",
    "a critical test of this model would be to run simulations where this ratio was small and look for a drop in @xmath191 in the saturated state .",
    "it s interesting to note that the only numerical simulation with no imposed field and with disk vertical structure does seem to have a coherent component to the helicity , which may have the wrong sign to drive a conventional dynamo . this may account for the large rate of spontaneous field reversals when vertical structure is put in the simulations .",
    "the existence of such a component is consistent with the existence of an incoherent @xmath14 dynamo , but only if its amplitude scales steeply with the strength of turbulence in the disk .",
    "finally , we note that this model successfully reconciles phenomenological models of stellar accretion disks and the existence of a dynamo effect in a magnetized disk .",
    "the only drawback is that this model gives a relationship between @xmath6 and @xmath187 which is probably too steep , implying the existence of other , more efficient dynamo mechanisms in accretion disks in binary systems .",
    "this work has been supported in part by nasa grant nag5 - 2773 .",
