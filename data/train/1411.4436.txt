    "the quantum tunneling in a double - well potential is a core phenomenon  @xcite .",
    "the first qualitative results about the spectrum were already obtained back in 1927  @xcite .",
    "the analytic description of this phenomenon can be achieved in the semiclassical regime , i.  e. asymptotically by `` plank constant '' @xmath0 .",
    "the semiclassical approximation for the quantum tunneling is well studied in the case of a mirror - symmetric double - well potential .",
    "namely the first semiclassical formulas for tunneling energy splitting was obtained in  @xcite for the case of high exited states , and in  @xcite for the case of lower energy levels , also see  @xcite and therein for more details .",
    "the multidimensional generalization of the asymptotic formula for tunneling splitting was rigorously proved in  @xcite for the pair of ground state energies , also see  @xcite .",
    "some deep results about semiclassical spectrum and the corresponding stationary states ( as `` avoided crossing '' and `` the flea on the elephant '' effects ) are also known in the case of asymmetric double - well potential  @xcite , including the multidimensional case  @xcite .    recall that if the double - well potential is symmetric , the spectrum of the schrdinger operator consists of pairs of exponentially close ( as @xmath0 ) points and the corresponding stationary states are symmetric and antisymmetric .",
    "if a state is asymptotically localized in only one well then it is not a stationary state , but it can be represented as a linear combination of symmetric and antisymmetric stationary states with slightly different energies .",
    "this results in the effect of tunneling transport when a state initially localized in one well starts tunneling oscillations between two wells with a certain period .",
    "the period depends on the tunnel splitting of the energy levels .",
    "similar effect can also take place for an asymmetric double - well potential under a priori condition that stationary states are localized in both potential wells  @xcite .",
    "the general criterion of such a bilocalization of stationary states for asymmetric double - well potentials was obtained in  @xcite .    in the given paper",
    "we consider a specifically chosen double - well potential that is equal to the sum of a basic `` physically given '' well and a square shape probing well .",
    "let us assume that the physical well is a generic smooth finite function . to be definite , assume that the probing well is placed on the right from the physical well ( see fig .",
    "the parameters of the probing square well ( depth , width and position ) are varied .",
    "we study the dynamics of a state initially localized in the physical well . if parameters of the probing well are generic then the property of localization in the physical well is preserved in time ( with exponential accuracy as @xmath0 ) .",
    "but for some specific values of parameters the situation is changed : the initial state is leaving the physical well , transported to the probing one , then returns back to the physical well , and so on .",
    "the states starts oscillations between two wells . thus under a specific tuning of parameters",
    "the observer can detect the initial physical state via its full appearance in the probing well .",
    "this phenomenon can be referred as _ tunnel catch _ effect .",
    "based on the results of  @xcite we derive the explicit analytic conditions for appearance of this effect ( see eq .  ( [ eqcondsq ] ) ,  ( [ eqw ] ) ) .",
    "note that the general problem to find conditions for the tunnel catch are interesting from physical standpoint  @xcite ; for particular examples they were considered in  @xcite using numerical methods .",
    "we show that the observation of the tunnel catch effect can be used to detect the energy level of the physical well ( see conclusions ) .",
    "we also derive an asymptotic formula for the probability of finding the state in the probing well ( see eq .",
    "( [ eqpmax ] ) ) and calculate the leading term of the tunneling splitting of energy levels in our specific double well potential .",
    "we consider the one - dimensional schrdinger equation @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the small parameter of semiclassical approximation and the schrdinger operator is @xmath3 the potential @xmath4 is equal to the sum of two negative finite functions whose supports do not intersect , @xmath5 @xmath6 the physical ( left ) well is smooth ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , @xmath7 and the probing ( right ) well has a square shape @xmath8 the width @xmath9 of the probing well is a controllable parameter .",
    "we assume that the initial state @xmath10 is localized in the physical well with energy close to a negative value @xmath11 . for simplicity ,",
    "let @xmath10 be just equal to the eigenstate @xmath12 corresponding an eigenvalue @xmath13 of the schrdinger operator with potential @xmath14 .",
    "thus the `` physical '' initial state @xmath15 is completely independent from the probing well .",
    "the probabilities @xmath16 and @xmath17 of finding the state @xmath18 in the left and in the right potential wells at time @xmath19 can be used to detect chances in the state localization .",
    "the probabilities are calculated as integrals of @xmath20 by @xmath21 over neighborhoods of the left and right wells respectively .",
    "the maximal probability of finding the state in the probing well is @xmath22 the _ tunnel catch effect _ is said to appear if @xmath23 does not tend to zero as @xmath0 .",
    "we show below that @xmath23 approaches @xmath24 as @xmath0 for certain discrete values of the parameter @xmath9 .",
    "thus the full size tunnel catch effect appear , if the probing well is specially tuned .",
    "let us consider a generic double - well potential that is the sum of two finite potential wells .",
    "the corresponding schrdinger operators is @xmath25 where @xmath26 it is well known that the spectrum of schrdinger operator with double well potential could contain pairs of exponentially close points and corresponding eigenstates could be localized in both wells  @xcite . using results of  @xcite , we derive below asymptotic formulas for spectrum of @xmath27 and for corresponding eigenstates .",
    "first let us introduce two schrdinger operators @xmath28 @xmath29 the operators @xmath30 separately describe the left and right finite wells .",
    "let @xmath31 and @xmath32 be the left and right turning points of the potential barrier ( see .",
    "2 ) .    consider a point @xmath33 such that @xmath34 where @xmath35 .",
    "the point @xmath33 is a _ potential barrier center _ from the standpoint of the action in the instanton sense .",
    "the leading role of instanton metric in double - well potentials was studied in  @xcite and in series of papers  @xcite .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that the asymptotic formulas for the spectrum and eigenstates of @xmath27 could be presented in terms of the spectrum of @xmath36 and @xmath37 if @xmath38 this inequality means that the point @xmath33 does not belong to the support of @xmath4 .",
    "it is equivalent to the inequality @xmath39 where @xmath40 are tunnel actions on the left and right banks of the barrier , @xmath41    let @xmath42 be an eigenvalue of @xmath43 and @xmath44 be the corresponding eigenstate , @xmath45 .",
    "then the spectrum of @xmath27 near energy @xmath46 consists of points @xmath47 and @xmath48 with exponential accuracy  @xcite as @xmath0 .",
    "the eigenstate of @xmath27 either tends to @xmath12 or @xmath49 if the distance between @xmath47 and @xmath48 is not exponentially small .",
    "conversely , if it is exponentially small , then there is a pair of exponentially close points in the spectrum of @xmath27 , and the corresponding eigenstates tend to linear combinations of @xmath12 and @xmath49 .",
    "[ lemm ] let the condition  ( [ eqcond]a ) holds and the energies @xmath47 and @xmath48 coincide with each other : @xmath50 then there are two points @xmath51 and @xmath52 in spectrum of @xmath27 exponentially close to @xmath46 as @xmath0 .",
    "the corresponding eigenstates of @xmath27 are localized in both potential wells and have the form @xmath53 with exponential accuracy as @xmath0 .    moreover , if @xmath54 , but the distance between @xmath47 and @xmath48 is exponentially small as @xmath0 , then the points @xmath55 of the spectrum of @xmath27 satisfies the following approximate formula : @xmath56 where @xmath57_{x = c}\\ ] ] therefore the leading term of the splitting @xmath58 is @xmath59 the corresponding eigenstates of @xmath27 have the form @xmath60 where @xmath61    it follows from  ( [ eqtan ] ) that the eigenstates @xmath62 are localized in both the left and right potential wells if @xmath63 .",
    "conversely , the eigenstates @xmath62 are exponentially close to @xmath64 if @xmath65 is much greater than @xmath66 .",
    "lemma formulated above and equations  ( [ eqe12])-([eqtan ] ) follow from results of  @xcite that were derived based on the two - level approximation method .",
    "we do not formulate here the exact condition on smoothness of the potential wells , but it certainly includes the case of piecewise continuous functions , which is discussed in the next section .",
    "let the probing ( right ) well be of square shape , as it was described in section  [ sec2 ] .",
    "then condition  ( [ eqcond]a ) becomes @xmath67 the integral in  ( [ eqcondsq ] ) is taken over the interval @xmath68 $ ] where the physical well @xmath69 varies from the value @xmath70 to the value @xmath71 .",
    "we suppose the condition  ( [ eqcondsq ] ) is satisfied , i.e. the probing well is far enough from the physical well .",
    "the negative discrete energy levels @xmath72 of the square shape probing well are the solutions of the following equation @xmath73 here @xmath74 be the number of the energy level @xmath75 .",
    "thus the distance between adjacent energy levels of the operator @xmath37 has order @xmath76 near the bottom of the square potential well and has order @xmath77 for high energy levels with @xmath78 .    using explicit equation  ( [ eqer ] )",
    ", we can easily obtain approximate formulas for @xmath79 .",
    "namely the asymptotic expansion of @xmath79 as @xmath0 for finite @xmath74 is @xmath80    by substituting the wkb approximation of @xmath12 and the explicit form of @xmath49 into  ( [ eqdpsi ] ) , we derive @xmath81,\\ ] ] where @xmath82 is the classical frequency of oscillations in the left well @xmath14 for the energy @xmath46 .",
    "let the width @xmath83 of the probing well be tuned in such a way that the energy @xmath47 of the initial state @xmath12 coincides with the energy @xmath79 of the probing well ( see fig .",
    "3 ) : @xmath84 from  ( [ eqer ] ) we compute @xmath85.\\ ] ]    let condition  ( [ eqcondsq ] ) holds and the width of the probing well @xmath9 coincide with one of the resonance value @xmath86  ( [ eqw ] ) .",
    "then the initial state localized in the probing well starts tunneling oscillations between wells , and the maximal probability of finding the state in the probing well approaches @xmath24 as @xmath0 .",
    "we can similarly consider the depth @xmath87 of the probing will as a varying parameter , and formulate a similar theorem .",
    "therefore , there is the series of the resonance values @xmath88 such that the energy of the initial state @xmath47 coincide with one of the energies @xmath79 of the probing well .",
    "in contrast to explicit formula  ( [ eqw ] ) for the resonance width values , using equation  ( [ eqer ] ) , we can obtain only an approximate formula for the resonance depth values @xmath89 @xmath90 where @xmath74 is a finite number .    using the lemma of sect .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we expand the initial state @xmath15 with respect to eigenstates of operator  @xmath27 : @xmath91 then the solution of the cauchy s problem  ( [ eqsh ] ) with exponential accuracy as @xmath0 is @xmath92 where @xmath93 .",
    "it is clear that the state @xmath18 is oscillating between the physical well and the probing well , and the state @xmath18 is localized only in the probing will with exponential accuracy when @xmath94 .",
    "thus we obtain the series of width values @xmath95 such that the fixed energy level @xmath47 of the physical well coincides with levels @xmath79 of the probing well . for these values of the parameter",
    "@xmath9 the probability @xmath23 approaches @xmath24 , see fig .  4 .",
    "thus if the probing well is well tuned , namely if its width @xmath9 coincides with one of the values @xmath96  ( [ eqw ] ) then the probing well `` catch '' the state with the energy @xmath47 localized in the physical well .",
    "further , let us consider the width of the probing well @xmath9 to be close to the critical value @xmath86 ( see fig . 3 and 4 ) to determine the width of resonance peaks of @xmath23 .",
    "using  ( [ eqpsi12 ] ) we derive @xmath97 then the asymptotic solution of the cauchy s problem  ( [ eqsh ] ) is @xmath98    the probability @xmath99 and @xmath100 of finding the state @xmath18 in the left and right potential wells at time @xmath101 are @xmath102 @xmath103 therefore , we derive @xmath104 @xmath105 @xmath106 using  ( [ eqtan ] ) , we finally obtain @xmath107 thus , the state significantly manifest itself in the probing well if and only if @xmath108 . the width of resonance peaks ( see fig .",
    "4 ) is exponentially small and has oder @xmath109 as @xmath0 .",
    "we obtain the explicit formula for resonance values of the external parameter  ( [ eqw ] ) and for the width of the resonance peaks  ( [ eqpmax ] ) in the case of the double - well potential presented at fig .",
    "1 . we also obtain approximate formula  ( [ eqvk ] ) for resonance values of the probing well depth @xmath87 if it is considered as a varying parameter instead of the width @xmath9 .",
    "these results can be used to determine the energy of the initial state localized in the physical potential well ( the left in fig .",
    "1 ) . namely , let us adiabatically increase the width @xmath9 ( or the depth @xmath87 ) of the probing ( right ) well , starting from such a small value that there is no bounded state in the probing well .",
    "thus , it is possible to determine the first resonance value of the external parameter ( first resonance peak in fig .",
    "4 ) and find the corresponding energy of the initial state by the formula  ( [ eqerk ] ) with @xmath110 @xmath111 a further increase of the varying parameter will lead to the disappearance of the tunneling catch effect , and then again to its appearance at the next resonance value . therefore , we can determine the energy level of the general physical well by the detection of the tunnel catch effect varying a parameter of the probing well .",
    "the tunneling catch of the state initially localized in one well is a general effect .",
    "for example , one can similarly obtain it by consider a different configuration of the probing will .",
    "this effect owes to an avoided crossing of energy levels in the case of general one - dimensional double - well potential depending on an external varying parameter .",
