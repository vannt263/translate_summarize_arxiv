    "ultracold atomic gases are many - body systems , but most of their fundamental properties originate from the underlying two - body problem , given by an interaction potential which is typically considered as short - range . the situation is completely different in dipolar gases due to the long - range character of the dipole  dipole interaction  @xcite .",
