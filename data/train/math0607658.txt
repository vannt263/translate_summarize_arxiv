    "let us briefly motivate our interest in determining the spectral type of a self - adjoint operator .",
    "let @xmath0 be a probability measure on the real line @xmath1 .",
    "it is well - known that this measure has a lebesgue decomposition @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure on @xmath1 , @xmath4 is singular with respect to lebesgue measure , and has no atomic part , i.e. @xmath5 for all @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is purely atomic .",
    "this decomposition of a probability measure has important applications in the theory of a self - adjoint operator @xmath8 on a ( separable ) hilbert space @xmath9 . associated with @xmath8 is the spectral measure @xmath10 .",
    "the spectral theorem states that we have @xmath11 if @xmath12 , then @xmath13 is a probability measure , which is supported on the spectrum @xmath14 of @xmath8 .",
    "the lebesgue decomposition of probability measures leads to an orthogonal decomposition of the hilbert space @xmath15 each subspace is the closure of vectors @xmath16 , such that @xmath17 is purely absolutely continuous , etc .",
    "the subspaces reduce the operator @xmath8 , such that @xmath18 is a self - adjoint operator on @xmath19 , etc . in the case of absolutely continuous and singular continuous parts",
    ", one defines the corresponding parts of the spectrum to be those of the restricted operators . in the point spectrum case one",
    "usually takes @xmath20 to be the set of eigenvalues of @xmath8 , in order to handle the case , when the operator has a dense set of eigenvalues .",
    "the spectrum of the operator restricted to @xmath21 is then the closure of this set .",
    "the spectral types of an operator @xmath8 , which is the hamiltonian of a quantum mechanical system , is related to the dynamics of the system , although the relation is by no means simple .",
    "the relation comes from the representation of the time evolution operator@xmath22 as @xmath23 in some quantum mechanical systems ( e.g. atoms and molecules ) the absolutely continuous part is related to the scattering states , since @xmath24 tends to zero for @xmath25 ( a consequence of the riemann ",
    "lebesgue lemma ) , and the eigenvalues of @xmath8 are related to the bound states . in many of these systems",
    "one expects that the singular continuous component is absent , and many techniques have been developed to prove this type of result . in solid state physics",
    "the situation is somewhat different , and here one has a wider variety of spectral types .",
    "these applications have motivated us to seek new criteria for identifying the spectral type of a self - adjoint operator .",

    "was first used by last @xcite and general criteria for recovering a measure from its borel transform was done by simon @xcite .",
