    "diversity coding and node repair are two fundamental ingredients of reliable distributed storage systems .",
    "this paper considers the problem of @xmath0 multilevel diversity coding with regeneration ( mldr ) , which was first introduced in @xcite . in this problem ,",
    "a total of @xmath1 independent messages @xmath2 of @xmath3 bits , respectively , are to be stored in @xmath4 nodes each of capacity @xmath5 bits .",
    "two requirements need to be satisfied : ( i ) * diversity reconstruction * : for any @xmath6 , the message @xmath7 can be recovered by accessing any @xmath8 ( out of the total @xmath9 ) storage nodes , and ( ii ) * node regeneration * : for any @xmath10 , the data stored at node @xmath11 can be regenerated by extracting @xmath12 bits of information each from any @xmath1 other nodes .",
    "we call such a code an @xmath13 mldr code . a normalized storage - capacity _ vs_. repair - bandwidth pair @xmath14 is said to be _ achievable _ for a given normalized message size tuple @xmath15 if an @xmath13 mldr code can be found such that @xmath16 for @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "a precise mathematical description of the problem can be found in @xcite .",
    "a natural strategy for this problem is to encode each individual message separately using an exact - repair regenerating code @xcite of necessary parameters .",
    "more precisely , suppose that each message @xmath7 is encoded using an @xmath20 exact - repair regenerating code ( _ i.e. _ , when storing a single message @xmath7 of @xmath21 bits , accessing any @xmath8 nodes of @xmath22 capacity each can reconstruct @xmath7 , and any node can be regenerated by extracting @xmath23 bits data each from any @xmath1 other nodes ) .",
    "then , we have @xmath24 and @xmath25 for the resulting mldr code .",
    "let us define the individually normalized storage - capacity _ vs_. repair - bandwidth pair as @xmath26 for @xmath6 .",
    "the overall storage - capacity _ vs_. repair - bandwidth pair achieved by the separate coding scheme for the mldr problem is thus given by : @xmath27 a fundamental problem of interest is whether separate coding can achieve the _ optimal _ tradeoffs between the normalized storage capacity and repair bandwidth for the mldr problem .",
    "mldr problem with @xmath28 @xcite . the two new outer bounds and intersect precisely at the mbr point . ]",
    "this question was first answered in @xcite , where it was shown that separate coding is in general _",
    "suboptimal_. for concreteness , figure  [ fig ] shows the optimal tradeoff curve between the normalized storage capacity and repair bandwidth and the best possible tradeoffs that can be achieved by separate coding ( see @xcite ) with @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath28 .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig ] , separate coding is suboptimal when @xmath31 . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath32 or @xmath33 , separate coding can in fact achieve the optimal tradeoffs .",
    "in particular , for this example , separate encoding achieves the minimum - storage - regenerating ( msr ) point @xmath34 and the minimum - bandwidth - regenerating ( mbr ) point @xmath35 .",
    "in addition , it was shown in @xcite that the optimality of separate coding at the msr point is _ not _ a coincidence and in fact holds for _ any _ mldr problem .",
    "it is thus natural to ask whether the same generalization holds for the mbr point as well ; this problem was left open in @xcite .    in this paper , we proved two new outer bounds on the optimal tradeoffs between the normalized storage - capacity and repair - bandwidth for general mldr problem , by which the optimality of separate coding at the mbr point follows immediately .",
    "our proofs are based on the classical  peeling \" argument , which sequentially removes the effects of certain coding requirements by grouping the corresponding random variables under the conditional terms .",
    "the technique was first introduced in @xcite and subsequently used in @xcite to prove the optimality of separate coding at the msr point .",
    "the telescoping results here , however , are much more involved than those proved in @xcite and @xcite .    _",
