    "in recent years the problem of an impurity coupled to a quantum bath has received a large attention in the field of ultracold atoms both theoretically and experimentally . in particular , the fermionic version of this problem , _",
    "i.e. _ when the bath is a spin - polarized fermi sea , is already a well studied topic with different interesting perspectives addressing the attractive and repulsive branch as well as low dimensions  @xcite . on the contrary , for the bosonic counterpart corresponding to an impurity immersed in a bose condensed medium ,",
    "only very recently there have been experimental studies focusing on the excitation energy and spectral response of the polaron quasiparticle  @xcite .",
    "previous experiments investigated mainly collisional and dissipation processes involving the bath  @xcite . on the theoretical side , the bose polaron problem has been already addressed in a series of studies uitilizing different tools such as t - matrix  @xcite and perturbation  @xcite approaches , variational wavefunction  @xcite as well as quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods  @xcite .",
    "low dimensions , and in particular one - dimensional ( 1d ) configurations , enrich the bose polaron problem with some peculiar features that are worth investigating . first of all the enhanced role of quantum fluctuations capable to destroy the off - diagonal long - range order responsible for bose - einstein condensation even at zero temperature .",
    "secondly , the possibility to achieve strongly correlated regimes for the quantum bath , where the bosons approach the so called tonks - girardeau ( tg ) limit of fermion - like impenetrable particles  @xcite .",
    "the use of confinement induced resonances of the @xmath0-wave scattering amplitude represents for these 1d systems a powerful tool , allowing for a wide tunability of both the interactions within the bath and between the bath and the impurity  @xcite . for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite a 1d mixture of k impurities in a gas of rb atoms was realized and different values of the impurity - bath interaction , obtained by varying the magnetic field , were probed .",
    "the gas parameter in the bath can also be tuned by changing the density or the effective mass of the atoms by means of a lattice potential  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we investigate theoretically the bose polaron problem when the quantum bath is modeled by a lieb - liniger gas with contact interactions  @xcite and the impurity is coupled to the bath via a different @xmath1-like potential that can be both attractive and repulsive .",
    "different regimes of the surrounding medium are considered and analyzed as a function of the impurity - boson coupling strength : i ) the bath is weakly interacting and well described by the mean - field theory , ii ) interactions in the bath are relatively strong and beyond mean - field effects are important , and finally iii ) the bath is in the tg regime and some analytical results are available thanks to the bose - fermi mapping  @xcite .",
    "we characterize the bose polaron by calculating its binding energy , effective mass , and contact parameter .",
    "furthermore , we consider both the case of a mobile impurity having the same mass of the particles in the medium and the case of a static impurity , corresponding to the limit of a much larger impurity to boson mass ratio .",
    "the results show that the polaron energy reaches a constant value for large repulsive impurity - boson interaction , whereas in the opposite limit of large attraction the impurity gets deeply bound to the bath .",
    "unless the bosons are impenetrable particles , this binding energy is found to be much larger than the one of the dimer state , the solution to the two - body problem in vacuum .",
    "the tendency of bosons attracted by the impurity to form large clusters involving many particles is also evident from the density profile of the medium around the impurity .",
    "the size of these clusters , as well as their binding energy , increases with decreasing interaction strength within the bath , indicating an instability of the weakly interacting lieb - liniger gas towards collapse around an attractive impurity .",
    "the effective mass of the polaron moving in a weakly interacting medium exhibits a sharp increase as a function of the coupling , both on the repulsive and on the attractive side of the impurity - bath interaction .",
    "already for a moderate coupling strength the impurity gets very heavy , thus realizing the so - called `` self - localization '' regime predicted by landau and pekar for polarons in crystals  @xcite .",
    "this picture was also proposed for bose polarons in three dimensions ( 3d ) on the basis of a frhlich - type model  @xcite which , however , does not capture the relevant physics at strong coupling  @xcite . on approaching the tg limit , instead , the effective mass increases sizeably only for large values of the coupling on the repulsive side and saturates at twice the bare mass on the attractive side .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the results mentioned above are directly relevant for experiments on few impurities in a quantum bath where the binding energy can be measured using spectroscopic techniques  @xcite and the effective mass from the study of collective modes in harmonic traps  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the hamiltonian of the system and we review or derive some analytical results that are obtained using perturbation theory in the limit of weak interactions or the bose - fermi mapping in the tg limit . in sec .",
    "iii we briefly provide some details about the qmc techniques used to address this specific problem and about the physical observables calculated in the simulations .",
    "iv contains a detailed discussion of the results and a comparison with the analytical predictions available for specific regimes of parameters . finally , in sec .",
    "v we draw our conclusions and we outline possible future prospects of this work .",
    "we consider the following hamiltonian @xmath2 describing a 1d system of @xmath3 identical bosons with mass @xmath4 interacting via a repulsive contact potential of strength @xmath5 .",
    "a single impurity of mass @xmath6 is coupled to the particles of the bath via another contact potential characterized by the strength @xmath7 .",
    "the coordinates of the bosons and the impurity are denoted respectively by @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) and @xmath10 .",
    "we introduce the dimensionless parameters @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the density of the bath in the 1d box of size @xmath13 .",
    "the first parameter gives the strength of interactions within the bath which can range from the weakly correlated mean - field regime ( @xmath14 ) to the strongly correlated tg regime ( @xmath15 ) , where bosons are impenetrable and behave similarly to a gas of spinless fermions .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 is instead related to the coupling between the impurity and the bath and , contrary to @xmath17 , can be either positive or negative depending on the sign of @xmath7 .",
    "notice that for equal masses ( @xmath18 ) and for equal coupling strengths ( @xmath19 ) the equality @xmath20 holds .",
    "the above hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) of the clean bath without the impurity was solved exactly by lieb and liniger  @xcite for a system in the thermodynamic limit and with periodic boundary conditions .",

    "as we already mentioned , the former result holds in the weak - coupling regime and includes the bogoliubov term and the first beyond mean - field correction whereas , in the latter , the leading term corresponds to the energy of the equivalent non - interacting fermi gas .",
    "the binding energy of the impurity is defined as the energy difference between the ground state of the system with and without the impurity .",

    "@xmath16 one can determine the energy and the effective mass of the polaron by using the perturbation approach based on the bogolubov approximation as it is outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite . by introducing the mass ratio @xmath31 of the bosonic to the impurity mass ,",
    "the result for the polaron energy reads : @xmath32 and for the effective mass one finds @xmath33 the first term in eq .  [ enerpert ] is the mean - field contribution proportional to @xmath7 , whereas next - to - leading order corrections to both @xmath34 and the effective mass are proportional to @xmath35 and are independent of the sign of the impurity - boson interaction .",
    "we also notice that in the limit @xmath36 , for a fixed value of @xmath16 , both these corrections diverge , signalling an instability of the medium surrounding the impurity when boson - boson interactions are suppressed .",
    "the situation is different in the 3d case where , in the same limit , only the effective mass exhibits a divergent behavior  @xcite .",
    "we consider explicitly two particular values of the mass ratio @xmath37 : the case of equal masses ( @xmath38 ) and the case of a static impurity with infinite mass ( @xmath39 ) .",

    "notice that the energy of the mobile impurity ( [ mcguire1 ] ) in the limit of infinite repulsion is twice the corresponding energy of the static impurity ( [ mustatic ] ) , even though the effective mass ( [ mcguire2 - 1 ] ) diverges in the same limit .",
    "this is due to the kinetic energy contribution of the mobile impurity within the region of space delimited by the two nearest neighbour particles of the bath acting as impenetrable barriers .",
    "another asymptotically exact result for a static impurity ( @xmath39 ) is obtained when interactions within the bath are weak ( @xmath14 ) and there is a strong impurity - boson repulsion ( @xmath46 ) . in this case , the polaron energy coincides with the excitation energy of a dark soliton  @xcite @xmath59 this excited state of the gas is indeed stationary and is characterized by a zero in the density profile .",
    "an important quantity describing the interaction between the impurity and the bath is the contact @xmath60 , defined as the value of the boson density at the impurity position normalized by the bulk density : @xmath61 . by using the hellmann - feynman theorem",

    "we consider a system of @xmath3 identical particles and one impurity contained in a 1d box of size @xmath13 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the trial wave function is comprised of two terms : the first takes into account correlations among the particles in the bath and the second between these particles and the impurity .",
    "both pair correlation functions satisfy boundary conditions when the two particles meet to enforce the contact interactions present in the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",

    "for the impurity - boson correlation term one should distinguish between the case of repulsive ( @xmath77 ) and attractive ( @xmath56 ) interactions .",

    "we find that the repulsive polaron can never exceed the energy reached when the bath is in the tg regime . on the contrary ,",
    "the binding energy of the attractive polaron lies always below the energy of a dimer in vacuum and becomes increasingly large as the repulsion within the medium is reduced , thereby signalling an instability of the weakly interacting gas towards collapse around the impurity position .",
    "furthermore , in the regime of a weakly repulsive medium , the polaron effective mass is found to increase sharply with the strength of the impurity - bath coupling .",
    "such a heavy impurity , practically immobile within the medium , realizes the long - sought after regime of  self - localization \" of the strongly coupled landau - pekar polaron .",
    "interesting future prospects of this work include the study of a finite concentration of impurities in a 1d quantum bath .",

    "<S> we present a theoretical study based upon quantum monte carlo methods of the bose polaron in one - dimensional systems with contact interactions . in this instance of the problem of a single impurity immersed in a quantum bath , the medium is a lieb - liniger gas of bosons ranging from the weakly interacting to the tonks - girardeau regime , whereas the impurity is coupled to the bath via a different contact potential producing both repulsive and attractive interactions . both the case of a mobile impurity , having the same mass as the particles in the medium , and of a static impurity with infinite mass are considered . </S>",
    "<S> we make use of exact numerical techniques that allow us to calculate the ground - state energy of the impurity , its effective mass as well as the contact parameter between the impurity and the bath . </S>",
    "<S> these quantities are investigated as a function of the strength of interactions between the impurity and the bath and within the bath . in particular , we find that the effective mass rapidly increases to very large values when the impurity gets strongly coupled to an otherwise weakly repulsive bath . </S>",
    "<S> this heavy impurity hardly moves within the medium , thereby realizing the `` self - localization '' regime of the landau - pekar polaron . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we compare our results with predictions of perturbation theory valid for weak interactions and with exact solutions available when the bosons in the medium behave as impenetrable particles . </S>"
