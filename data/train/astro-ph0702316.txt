    "because the evolution of the hi content with time promises to be a powerful tracer of galaxy evolution even into the so - called `` dark ages '' , it remains imperative to understand fully the true census of hi - bearing objects at @xmath10 . as spectroscopic tracers , hi emission line profiles yield not only the redshift , but also measures of the total hi mass and the radial component of the rotational velocity via the hi line width , thus providing quantitative insight into the gas content and total mass . at the same time that wide area optical ( e.g. sloan digital sky survey : sdss ; york _ et al . _",
    "2000 ) and near - infrared ( e.g. two - micron all - sky survey : 2mass ; skrutskie _ et al .",
    "_  2006 ) surveys have been cataloging millions of galaxies , the hi parkes all - sky survey ( hipass ; barnes _ et al . _  2001",
    ") produced the first wide area blind extragalactic hi line survey .",
    "hipass covered @xmath830000 deg@xmath11 , producing a final catalog ( meyer _ et al . _",
    "2004 ) of 4315 hi detections south of dec .",
    "= @xmath12 , and another 1002 ( wong _ et al . _",
    "2006 ) between @xmath13 dec @xmath14 . because hipass was limited in depth and resolution ,",
    "it did not sample adequate volume to yield a `` cosmologically fair '' sample of the universe ; the median redshift of hipass sources is @xmath82800 km  s@xmath5  , near the outer boundary of the local supercluster . of critical importance for the determination of the faint - end slope of the hi mass function ( himf ) ,",
    "only a handful of galaxies of very low hi mass were detected , and those were so near the milky way that distance uncertainties make their hi masses likewise highly uncertain ( masters _ et al . _",
    "2004 ) .",
    "hi line surveys are of special importance when combined with optical / ir surveys so that both the stellar and gaseous components are sampled . as was shown also by earlier studies such as the arecibo dual beam survey ( adbs : rosenberg & schneider 2002 ) ,",
    "blind hi surveys detect a population of low surface brightness , gas rich objects which are often missed by magnitude limited optical and near - ir samples .",
    "likewise , not all galaxies exhibit detectable hi line emission , and hi surveys are limited to some degree by their positional accuracy and angular resolution since the telescopes involved have relatively large beam sizes .",
    "a true accounting of the extragalactic census must incorporate full sampling of the population of gas - rich objects sampled by hi surveys in complement to the stellar - rich ones detected by surveys like sdss and 2mass .    based both on the success of hipass and its limitations ,",
    "we have initiated a `` second generation '' hi blind survey , the arecibo legacy fast alfa ( alfalfa ) survey , which exploits the availability of the new multi - beam arecibo l - band feed array ( alfa ) on the 305  m antenna .",
    "alfalfa will require @xmath8 4000 hours of telescope time to survey @xmath87000 deg@xmath11  of the high galactic latitude sky visible from arecibo ( giovanelli _ et al . _",
    "2005a : paper i ) .",
    "hipass used a 13 beam receiver on the parkes 62-m telescope ( 15.5  hpbw ) ; alfalfa exploits a similar 7-feed receiver array on the 305-m arecibo telescope ( @xmath83.5 ) .",
    "the survey design of alfalfa exploits the superior collecting area and angular resolution of the arecibo telescope as well as the broader bandwidth and spectral resolution of its digital correlator .",
    "furthermore , alfalfa makes use of automated signal detection techniques to produce source catalogs unbiased by the width of the hi signal ( saintonge 2007 ) . designed to surpass significantly the hi survey benchmark established by hipass , alfalfa improves on its predecessor by a factor of @xmath15 in sensitivity , @xmath16 in angular resolution , @xmath17 in spectral resolution and @xmath18 in spectral coverage .",
    "the added depth of alfalfa will allow it to sample a `` fair '' volume of the universe .",
    "in particular , alfalfa will sample well the volume corresponding to the so - called `` convergence depth '' ( giovanelli _ et al . _",
    "1998 ; dale & giovanelli 2000 ) which contributes most of the peculiar velocity of the milky way with respect to the cosmic microwave background .",
    "simulations presented in paper i predicted that alfalfa will detect some 20,000 extragalactic hi line sources , from very nearby low mass dwarfs to massive spirals at @xmath19 .",
    "the survey is designed specifically to determine robustly the himf in the local universe and will at the same time provide a census of hi in the surveyed sky area , making it especially useful in synergy with other wide area surveys such as sdss , 2mass , galex , astro  f , etc .",
    "the full scope and goals of the survey are described further in paper i.    hi line surveys yield three principal observational parameters : the integrated hi line flux , the systemic redshift and the doppler line width . for resolved objects",
    ", they can also yield an estimate of the hi size , and if the source fills the beam , the hi column density .",
    "alfalfa is expected to resolve about 500 nearby galaxies ; other objects with exceptionally extended hi distributions will also be mapped .",
    "its positional accuracy ( see section [ pos ] ) allows identification of the optical counterparts of the hi detections by immediate cross reference with the large optical / ir imaging databases .",
    "the most interesting objects will perhaps be the isolated hi sources which may _ not _ have optical counterparts , the so - called `` dark galaxies '' .",
    "the alfalfa survey was initiated in february 2005 . since then",
    ", we have conducted observations regularly and anticipate allocations of 700900 hours of telescope time per year . in order to provide timely information to the community , a public web site _",
    "is updated regularly to provide survey plans and status information .",
    "because of the 2-pass drift mode observing strategy ( paper i ) , complete spectral coverage combines many separate datasets obtained over observing periods spread over many months .",
    "final 3-d cubes from which signals can be reliably extracted can not be produced until the entire dataset covering a targeted region is acquired .",
    "in fact , the first - year datasets were rather incomplete , so that construction of full - coverage 3-d data cubes has been possible only recently .    given the area of sky visible to the arecibo telescope , a prime target for alfalfa is the virgo cluster and its surroundings . although the spirals in the core of the virgo cluster are strongly hi deficient ( davies & lewis 1973 ; chamaraux _ et al . _  1980",
    "; giovanelli & haynes 1983 ; solanes _ et al . _",
    "2002 ) , the cluster periphery contains many known optical late - type galaxies .",
    "alfalfa is specifically designed to detect objects of relatively low hi mass , @xmath20@xmath21 , at the virgo distance .",
    "hence , the virgo region of the sky was targeted by alfalfa from the beginning ; its central region has been the first zone to be surveyed completely . in this paper , we present a catalog of hi sources extracted from two constant declination strips of 3-d grids , covering a swath @xmath22 wide in declination @xmath2 dec.(j2000 ) @xmath3 and stretching @xmath23 in right ascension between @xmath0 r.a.(j2000 ) @xmath1 .",
    "this area includes the northern section of the virgo cluster . with a complete dataset now in hand for a first installment covering 132 deg@xmath11 , this paper presents the first alfalfa hi detection catalog , in the spirit of prompt access which the legacy nature of the survey promises .",
    "a catalog containing sources of the southern part of the virgo cluster region is in preparation ( kent _ et al . _  2007",
    ") .    in section [ obs ]",
    "we discuss the alfalfa survey observations and data analysis . in section [ cat ] , we briefly discuss issues related to the data quality of the region sampled by the catalog , as well as signal extraction criteria .",
    "the contents of the catalog are also described .",
    "section [ stats ] gives an overview of the statistical properties of the cataloged sample .",
    "the positional accuracy of the hi positions is discussed in section [ pos ] .",
    "section [ disc ] summarizes the hi detections presented here and what the results of this first installment predict for the future results of the full alfalfa survey .",
    "a hubble constant of 70 km  s@xmath5   mpc@xmath5 is used for distance dependent calculations , unless otherwise specified .",
    "alfalfa uses the 7feed alfa receiver system and a spectral line backend capable of instantaneously producing spectra from the two linear polarizations of each beam and covering a bandwidth of 100 mhz .",
    "the angular resolution of the survey is given by the elliptical shape of each of alfa s beams , @xmath24@xmath25(paper i ) , and the spectral resolution is 25 khz , which translates to about 5.5 km  s@xmath5  at @xmath26 km  s@xmath5  before spectral smoothing is applied .",
    "alfalfa surveys the sky with the telescope in `` almost fixed azimuth '' drift mode : the telescope azimuth arm is placed on the meridian , and the sky drifts by .",
    "small adjustments of the zenith angle are applied throughout the observing period to maintain the beam tracks at constant j2000 dec .",
    "each region of sky is visited twice , at two epochs spaced by a few months in the earth s orbit about the sun .",
    "no doppler tracking of the local oscillator frequency is employed , so that cosmic signals shift in frequency between the two epochs by the difference in their heliocentric velocities , projected along the line of sight .",
    "the resulting coverage yields parallel tracks of constant j2000 dec . , separated from one another by 1.05 .",
    "the sampling rate in r.a . is 1 hz . in both coordinates , the sampling is significantly better than the nyquist rate .",
    "data - taking for alfalfa was initiated in february 2005 and , in the practical context of time allocation at a widely used , multidisciplinary national facility like arecibo , completion of the full survey is projected to require about 6 years .",
    "more technical detail regarding the equipment , observing mode and sensitivity issues can be found in paper i.    the alfalfa data processing scheme has been briefly outlined in paper i and will be described in detail elsewhere ( giovanelli _ et al . _",
    "2007 , in preparation ; saintonge 2007 , submitted ) .",
    "full processing of all survey data to level i  which includes bandpass calibration , radio frequency interference ( hereafter `` rfi '' ) flagging , continuum source identification and extraction of drift scans  is carried out shortly after data taking , as anticipated in paper i. however , the production of 3-d data cubes which fully sample a region of sky requires the completion of both passes and thus can not be completed until all data covering that region are in hand . in paper",
    "i , we discussed the parceling of the sky in data processing units we referred to as `` tiles '' , of @xmath27 in r.a .",
    "by @xmath22 in dec . in practice , as the processing needs demanded a distributed strategy , data units of smaller size than the above mentioned tiles were found to be compatible with a `` minimum denominator '' computer performance .",
    "the data units thus adopted each cover a sky area of @xmath28 in r.a . and",
    "; in order to avoid confusion with the previous definition of tiles , we refer to regularly gridded data cubes of @xmath28 and preset centers as `` grids '' . centers of grids that are adjacent in r.a . are separated from each other by @xmath29 ; the separation in dec . is @xmath30 .",
    "a spatial overlap of about 20% in each coordinate allows effective spatial coverage of all sources found in the overlap regions . in order to maintain the gridded data file size at a limit comfortably manipulated by modest computer hardware",
    ", we break each spatial grid into four overlapping spectral subgrids of 1024 channels each , after discarding the bandends .",
    "because of rfi , the spectral resolution is not reduced at this stage , and , the full information on spectral weights , as described in sectin [ rfi ] below , is retained .",
    "each 1024 channel 3-d spectral cube has a final size of 380 mb .      in the interest of timely access to our data products by the community",
    ", we plan to release source catalogs at the earliest possible time , consistent with the legacy character of alfalfa .",
    "the catalog presented here is the first part of an archival database being developed as a collaborative project with the national astronomy and ionosphere center and the cornell theory center .",
    "the data catalog products will be available at _ http://arecibo.tc.cornell.edu/hiarchive _ as a node of the u.s .",
    "national virtual observatory ( nvo ) . included already at that website are catalogs and spectral data products of targeted single - beam hi observations of @xmath89000 galaxies observed by our group ( springob _ et al . _",
    "2006 ) and the alfalfa precursor observations ( paper ii ) . at the time of publication of this paper",
    ", the catalog presented here and access to the spectral profiles associated with the hi detections will be incorporated into our existing hi digital archive .",
    "an ongoing development effort aims its focus on the protocol for long  term public delivery of the 3d alfalfa data set through web  based access tools . at this time , delivery of the 3-d data is made possible through the observing team itself , by direct contact to r.g . or m.p.h .. a major challenge is data volume : each of the 3-d cubes covering the 34 individual `` grids '' constituting the current catalog require 1.5 gb . allowing access and manipulation of the gridded data",
    "publicly will require the development of distributed computational tools .    in this work , we present a catalog of hi sources extracted from the alfalfa grids covering a region stretching from @xmath31 to @xmath32 in dec . and from @xmath33 to @xmath34 in r.a . for reference to our database ,",
    "the denominations of the grids constituting this catalog are 1148 + 13 to 1356 + 13 and 1148 + 15 to 1356 + 15 , in steps of 8@xmath35 in r.a .",
    "the solid angle subtended by this region is @xmath8132 deg@xmath11 , which is @xmath36% of the sky to be ultimately surveyed by alfalfa .",
    "the coverage of the region is complete by the target goals of alfalfa , i.e. the region has been sampled by two separate passes with the alfa array in drift mode .",
    "the average quality of the data is fair to excellent ; details on the data quality at a particular location can be garnered by consultation with any of the cornell authors or by consultation of the alfalfa website mentioned in section 1 .",
    "this type of information will eventually be accessible through our nvo ",
    "compliant node .",
    "the surveyed region includes the northern part of the virgo cluster and m87 , at @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "the very strong radio source associated with m87 has a 1.4 ghz continuum flux of 220 jy , which increases the system temperature of the arecibo telescope at l band by a factor of 70 when m87 crosses within the main beam of the telescope .",
    "even when m87 is detected only through the near sidelobe structure of the beam , the sensitivity decreases drastically both because of the increased system temperature and because of the onset of strong spectral standing waves .",
    "effectively , a region of about @xmath39 to 1.5@xmath40 radius centered on m87 remains inaccessible to hi spectroscopy except for the very brightest hi sources , as we illustrate in section [ stats ] .      in practice",
    ", rfi contaminates certain regions of the observed spectral window .",
    "the data processing pipeline tracks the flagging from visual inspection of spectral samples which are deemed to be contaminated and assigns a weight to each pixel in 3-d space according to the degree of this flagging . the quality of the spectral coverage is exemplified in figure [ weights.ps ] , which shows the average `` spectral weight '' over the full region sampled by the present source catalog .",
    "a spectral weight of 1.0 indicates good data quality and full utilization of all the data at that frequency or cosmological recession velocity .",
    "we compute an array of spectral weights , which is a quality estimator , for each spatial pixel of the survey .",
    "the drops in the spectral weights at both ends of the graph in figure [ weights.ps ] arise from the diminished sensitivity found at the bandpass edges resulting from instrumental effects .",
    "the deep trough between 15000 and 16000 km  s@xmath5  is due to rfi originating from the federal aviation administration radar operating at 1350 mhz near the luiz muoz marin airport in san juan .",
    "the narrower features at 8800 km  s@xmath5  , 3300 km  s@xmath5  and 2200 km  s@xmath5  are modulations of the 1350 mhz radar signal occurring within the spectrometer . while the feature between 15000 and 16000 km  s@xmath5  renders inaccessible a larger cosmic volume , the feature at 8800 km  s@xmath5  affects a larger number of possible detections , given its spectral location in vicinity of the peak of the redshift distribution for our catalog . on average ,",
    "about 85% of the spectral bandpass is clear for astronomical use .",
    "the presence of rfi causes distinct volumes of the universe , which correspond to the frequency ranges of redshifted hi , to be `` obscured '' to alfalfa . in order to maintain a proper census of the survey volume",
    ", we use the 3-d `` pixel mask '' which records the spectral weights described above .",
    "shortly after each observing session , the individual 600-sec drift scans are processed to level i , that is , they are bandpass subtracted and calibrated , and flagging of channels affected by rfi is performed ( see paper i ) .",
    "once a region of the sky has been fully sampled by alfalfa , a 3-d grid is then generated from all of the individual drift scans that cross it . in practice ,",
    "the band edges are dropped , and four spectral subgrids , each comprising 1024 channels , with @xmath41 channel overlap of each , are constructed for each @xmath28 spatial grid .",
    "each spectral subgrid is then `` flat fielded '' ( i.e. baselined ) and made ready for source extraction .",
    "an automatic signal extractor described in saintonge ( 2007 ) that operates in the fourier domain produces a preliminary catalog of sources to a specified threshold in signal - to  noise ratio ( hereafter s / n ) .",
    "each candidate source is then examined visually and a decision on its inclusion in a final catalog , as well as a detailed , interactively obtained set of measurements yielding the principal source parameters , is made . a spatially integrated spectrum of the source and a postage ",
    "stamp 3d section of the grid centered on the source are archived .",
    "after hi source candidates are inspected , measured and cataloged , identification of possible optical counterparts is carried out through inspection of the sloan digital sky survey ( hereafter sdss ) , dss2 via _ skyview _ , ned and our privately maintained data base of extragalactic sources ( the `` agc '' , for `` arecibo general catalog '' ) .",
    "for the vast majority of hi source candidates of fair to excellent s / n , a relatively unambiguous identification of an optical counterpart is possible , thanks to the positional accuracy of the hi sources , as described in section [ pos ] . in our catalog",
    "we distinguish between 3 kinds of sources : ( a ) reliable , extragalactic hi candidate sources , down to a s / n threshold of approximately s / n=6.5 ( the limit is soft , as described further below ) ; ( b ) high s / n features of low velocity likely to be galactic or peri  galactic high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) ; ( c ) candidate hi sources of lower s / n ( approximately 4.5 to 6.5 ) , corroborated by the vicinity of a possible optical counterpart of the same redshift .",
    "the signal extraction process also yields candidate sources of lower s / n than those listed in the present catalog .",
    "a list of those objects is available upon request .",
    "as discussed in paper i , the most efficient strategy for confirming follow - up observations requires a high sky density of sources spread in @xmath42 but at similar declination .",
    "possible detections of low s / n will be observed in follow - up corroborating runs , which will help us quantify the reliability , i.e. the fraction of candidate sources which observations will confirm as real , as a function of the measured s / n .",
    "those observations will also deliver a significant addition of reliable detections , at a very low `` cost '' of telescope time per source ( see papers i and ii ) .",
    "a few details should be kept in mind in the use of the contents of table 1 , as described below :    * several objects straddle or are confused by the hi emission from the milky way .",
    "a spectrum of the object is generally obtained by subtracting a median spectrum obtained over a square perimetral segment of pixels around the source , from the inner part of the perimeter populated by the source . in some cases ,",
    "interpolation of the spectrum across the milky way emission provides an adequate result .",
    "sources for which these intrusive techniques are applied are noted in the footnotes to table 1 . *",
    "sources are often detected in the spectral vicinity of rfi features .",
    "interpolation across the region affected by rfi is often necessary .",
    "while the detection of the source may be clear , accurate measurement of its parameters may be impossible and much caution should be adopted in their use .",
    "this problem is frequent for sources between @xmath43 km  s@xmath5  and @xmath44 km  s@xmath5  , a spectral region not far removed from the median redshift of our catalog .",
    "each of these cases is noted in the footnotes to table 1 . *",
    "extended sources containing multiple concentrations , obviously physically associated , are sometimes found .",
    "we adopt the practice of measuring separately each of the concentrations and report them in table 1 as separate entries .",
    "they are also noted in the footnotes to table 1 .",

    "observations of optically selected samples amounting to many hundreds of hours of telescope time have yielded detections for 158 objects in the _ goldmine _ compilation of gavazzi _ et al . _  ( 2003 ) , some of which are fainter than the alfalfa detection limit ( and required a lot more integration time )",
    ". the blind hi virgo hijass survey ( davies _ et al . _",
    "2004 ) is partly contained within the survey area presented here . in the hijass region of full sensitivity which overlaps our alfalfa dataset ,",
    "hijass found 15 hi detections ; in contrast , we detect 193 hi sources in the same region .",

    "_  in preparation ) . likewise , the improvement over hipass is impressive . in the region containing",
    "the  hi detections included in table 1 , the hipass dataset includes only 40 objects ( wong _ et al . _",
    "2006 ) . of those ,",
    "several show large position offsets with respect to multiple alfalfa detections lying within a single parkes beam , and two are not confirmed by alfalfa .",
    "the median distance of this sample is 102 mpc . as of late august 2006 ,",
    "72% of the alfalfa hi detections presented here have optical or hi redshifts previously known and 28% are new .",
    "the percentage of alfalfa sources which are new hi detections is 69% . in view of the fact that numerous hi studies have been conducted in this region , largely based on optically selected targets ,",
    "the percentage of 69% _ new _ hi detections illustrates the fact that previous hi surveys , generally based on flux or size  limited , optically selected samples , missed the majority of hi sources : the conventional wisdom on which optical targets would turn out to be hi  rich appears to have been limited .",
    "about 25% of alfalfa detections have @xmath70 km  s@xmath5  .",
    "the fraction of local objects in the catalog presented here is enhanced by the fact that the region sampled crosses the supergalactic plane and the northern part of the virgo cluster , one of the densest regions of the local supercluster .",
    "the detection rate , of about 5.4 objects ( 4.4 of detection code 1 ) per square degree , is thus enhanced by a circumstance associated with the characteristics of the large  scale structure of the galaxy distribution in the local universe . were it not for the enhancement in the detections within the local supercluster",
    ", the detection rate would have been lower by about one fifth",
    ". this can be visually gauged by inspection of figure [ radec.ps ] , which shows the sky distribution of all the detected sources in the upper panel and that of objects with @xmath70 km  s@xmath5  in the lower panel .",
    "-3 cm -1 cm    as mentioned in section [ m87 ] , the region of about @xmath39 to 1.5@xmath40 radius about the location of m87 is contaminated by the high brightness of its strong radio source which not only increases the system temperature but also induces strong standing waves .",
    "therefore , the sky region around m87 can not be sampled by hi spectroscopy , except for the very brightest hi sources .",
    "the location of m87 is indicated in figure [ radec.ps ] , at the center of a region of rarefied density of hi detections .",
    "the upper panel of figure [ cone.ps ] shows the redshift distribution of the galaxies in the current sample .",
    "the signatures of the virgo cluster at the low velocity end and of other features in the large  scale structure of the local universe are clearly evident .",
    "the lack of detections on a strip nearly 1000 km  s@xmath5  wide near @xmath71 km  s@xmath5  reflects a bias of the survey",
    ". it corresponds to a spectral region heavily and nearly continuously affected by rfi , as shown in figure [ weights.ps ] .",
    "the lower panel of figure [ cone.ps ] shows the analogous diagram for the galaxies with known optical redshifts in the same region of the sky .",
    "the large - scale distribution properties of both samples are very similar .",
    "the most notable difference between the two plots is the rarefaction of sources at higher @xmath42 in the hi panel .",
    "figure [ histos.ps ]  summarizes the distribution in the values of heliocentric velocity @xmath46 , velocity width @xmath47 , flux integral @xmath49 , signal  to  noise ratio s / n and hi mass @xmath72 for the candidate hi detections reported in this catalog .",
    "we remind the reader that this survey is not designed to be complete to a given flux integral limit , but rather that the sensitivity limit is a function of velocity width , as discussed in paper i , paper ii and further below .",
    "we also note the paucity of sources with reported hi mass below @xmath73 @xmath21 in figure [ histos.ps](e ) ; while this may be due to a truly low cosmological population of low mass hi sources , the effect is likely to be , at least in part , spurious .",
    "as distances have been inferred from redshifts alone , albeit with the aid of a peculiar velocity flow model , the model yields highly uncertain distances within the region sampled , due to the presence of the virgo cluster : a very nearby , low velocity object is far more likely to be assigned the virgo cluster distance by the flow model than a virgo cluster object of low velocity to be assigned a low distance .",
    "the presence of the virgo cluster may thus operationally `` displace '' nearby objects , if any , making them appear farther than they truly are .",
    "figure [ histos.ps](e ) suggests that such may indeed be the case , as the number of objects plotted between @xmath74 and @xmath75 @xmath21 is overabundant for any reasonable shape of the hi mass function , in comparison with the higher mass bins .",
    "independent distance estimates of those objects are necessary , if a reliable determination of the hi mass function in virgo and in the field is to be obtained .",
    "this issue will be addressed in a forthcoming paper by kent _",
    "et al . _  ( 2007 , in preparation ) .",
    "figure [ himdist.ps](a ) displays a plot of hi mass versus distance for all objects in table 1 .",
    "vertical dotted lines outline the distance interval within which our survey is unable to detect any cosmic sources , due to the intrusion of rfi .",
    "galaxies in the virgo cluster appear as the vertical feature near @xmath76 mpc .",
    "figure [ himdist.ps](b ) shows that the s / n limit of the survey is relatively independent of velocity width .",
    "sources with velocity widths larger than a few hundred km  s@xmath5  are apparently identified reliably by our signal extraction algorithm .",
    "very few objects are found with velocity width smaller than 25 km  s@xmath5  .",
    "several candidate detections are obtained with narrow widths ; they lie generally near the detection limit and have no identifiable optical counterparts .",
    "most of them are believed to be due to rfi .",
    "determination of their nature will require follow  up corroborating observations .",
    "figure [ himdist.ps](c ) shows the dependence of the survey s limiting flux integral on velocity width . the dotted line indicates a detection threshold of @xmath77 , assuming that a spectral smoothing width of @xmath78 can be adopted for features as wide as 400 km  s@xmath5  , and a constant value of @xmath79 for features wider than 400 km  s@xmath5  ( see description of col",
    ". 8 of table 1 ) .",
    "the fact that the lower envelope of the data points appears consistent with a slope of 1/2 , rather than steepening to a slope of 1 , indicates that our adoption of a smoothing width is essentially correct .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to make available to the general community a data set of hi detections , with analysis of the overall properties of the sample kept at a minimum in the interest of speedy delivery .",
    "we address the reader to paper i and paper ii , in which a preliminary analysis was discussed .",
    "however , because of the dependence of the performance properties of the arecibo telescope on the direction in which it points , some characteristics of the alfalfa samples will be sky zone dependent .",
    "one of such characteristics is the positional accuracy of the hi detections , which carry the imprint of the telescope pointing errors .",
    "thus we devote this section to a brief analysis of that matter .",
    "the corrections we will find are specific to the data set presented here .",
    "positional accuracy of hi sources is of paramount importance per se and in making identification with sources from other catalogs .",
    "the main limiting factor for alfalfa sources is of course the resolution of the alfa beam .",
    "as discussed in paper i , the alfa beams are slightly elliptical , with half - power - full - widths of 3.3  and 3.8 . the major axis of the beam is always directed along the position of the telescope s azimuth arm ; the vast majority of the alfalfa observations and all those presented in this paper are made with the azimuth arm in the north - south direction , thus the beam s major axis is in the declination direction .",
    "alfalfa samples the sky every second in r.a . and",
    "every arcminute in dec .",
    "however , sources are extracted  and their positions measured  after the data are converted to a spatial grid sampled at @xmath80  @xmath81 @xmath80 .",
    "a gaussian weight function is applied as part of the regridding process , which reduces the spatial resolution of the data to @xmath82  @xmath83 .",
    "an automatic source extraction algorithm identifies a source candidate , which is successively measured and `` extracted '' interactively by an observer .",
    "the spectral extent of the feature is gauged and a 2d map of the emission is integrated over that full spectral extent .",
    "ellipses are fitted to the image at a set of fixed isophotal levels as well as at the half  power and quarter  power of the peak level , as measured in flux density units per beam area .",
    "the position of the source is assumed , in all cases , to be the center of the half - power ellipse .",
    "this has proved to be the best choice for the vast majority of sources , as they are generally unresolved by the alfa beam .",
    "caution is necessary when sources are extended and do not display a clear center of symmetry .",
    "a more detailed description of the positional parameter estimates will be presented elsewhere , together with the overall description of the alfalfa data processing pipeline ( giovanelli _ et al . _",
    "2007 , in preparation ) .",
    "the second most important parameter regulating the quality of the alfalfa positions is the s / n of the hi emission .",
    "high s / n sources allow more accurate centroiding than low s / n ones , as discussed below .",
    "the third important influence on alfalfa positions is the quality of the arecibo telescope pointing .",
    "the telescope can set with a repeatable accuracy of a few arcsec ; however , the pointing algorithms which use fits to the telescope configurational parameters yield systematic pointing errors which may , at l band , add up to 15  or more .",
    "the highest pointing errors occur at the lowest zenith angles .",
    "the chosen observing mode for alfalfa , which freezes the telescope configuration at fixed azimuth , largely allows recovery and correction of the systematic pointing errors .",
    "positional accuracy is discussed here by using the positional differences between the hi emission ellipse centers and the centers of the galaxies which are identified as optical counterparts .",
    "those differences will include systematic telescope pointing offsets , occasional mismatch in the extent and center of optical and hi source , statistical errors in the hi centroiding and misidentification of optical counterparts .",
    "errors in the centroiding of the optical sources are negligible in comparison .",
    "a similar exercise to the one described below has been carried out by comparing alfalfa positions of continuum radio sources with interferometic positions .",
    "those results are in agreement with those discussed here and will be presented elsewhere ( kent et al .",
    "2007 , in preparation ) .",
    "figure [ dravsddec4 ] shows the positional differences ( hi minus optical ) , respectively in r.a .",
    "( @xmath84 ) and in dec .",
    "( @xmath85 ) , expressed in arcsec .",
    "the data are split into four panels differing in declination range , within bins of @xmath39 .",
    "the frame labeled `` dec 12 '' refers to sources between dec = @xmath31 and dec = @xmath86 and so on .",
    "as the observations were made with the telescope s azimuth arm oriented n  s , a degree of declination converts exactly in 1 degree of zenith angle ; the latitude of the arecibo telescope is @xmath87 20  37  n. the plot includes all the sources presented in table 1 , for which an optical identification was made .",
    "the hi positions used are those obtained _ before _ any correction for telescope pointing errors was applied .",
    "these sources were all observed at the same azimuth of @xmath88 and zenith angles between @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "a systematic offset in the center of the distribution towards positive @xmath84 and negative @xmath85 is apparent in all panels , with that offset becoming progressively larger with increasing declination , i.e. decreasing zenith angle .",
    "this offset mimics the telescope pointing errors ( see `` pointing errors '' at the website _",
    "http://www.naic.edu/@xmath8phil/sysperf/sysperf.html#alfa_ ) which increase as the telescope points closer to the site s zenith .",
    "the amplitude of the pointing errors is indicated by the insets in each plot , expressed respectively by the mean and the median .",
    "figure [ dravsddec4stn ] shows the distribution of positional offset between hi and optical positions after the systematic pointing errors described above have been removed from the hi positions .",
    "the separation of the data into four panels in this case is by s / n .",
    "the systematic pointing error that was removed is a simple function of dec .",
    ", i.e. zenith angle , obtained for each source by interpolating between the offsets shown in figure [ dravsddec4 ] .",
    "the hi source positions corrected for this systematic error are those listed in column 2 of table 1 .",
    "the dispersion of the positional differences about the center is , as expected , dependent on s / n . for the higher s / n objects ( @xmath91 ) , alfalfa positions are on average accurate to about 15 .",
    "alfalfa positions are significantly better than those obtained with the precursor run reported by paper ii ( median difference between hi and optical position of 34 ) .",
    "this is due to two reasons : ( i ) the alfalfa data include two full sweeps of each region of the sky with alfa , hence yielding twice as dense a spatial sampling in dec . as most of the data in the precursor run ; ( b ) the technique used to extract positional information , which fits ellipses to isophotal contours ,",
    "is more accurate than that used for the precursor run data .",
    "the principal aim of alfalfa is to obtain an accurate census of hi - bearing objects in the local universe .",
    "the catalog of candidate hi detections presented in table 1 yields a first picture of the `` alfalfa sky '' .",
    "as discussed in section [ stats ] and shown in figure 4 , alfalfa detections span five orders of magnitude in hi mass , and include both massive spirals out to @xmath92 0.06 and dwarf galaxies within a few mpc of the milky way .",
    "the region sampled by the present paper is strongly affected by local large scale structure ( the virgo cluster ) , as evident in the redshift distribution presented in figures [ histos.ps ]  and [ cone.ps ] .",
    "detailed studies regarding environmental influences on hi content , the himf and other characteristics will be incrementally enabled as further installments of alfalfa data become available .      *",
    "the alfalfa survey is delivering high quality 1.4 ghz spectral line data as anticipated .",
    "the adopted `` minimum intrusion '' observing technique ( paper i ) is highly successful at reducing spectral baseline instability , beam and sidelobe variations and gain instabilities . through a combination of deliberate calibration technique and empirical checks",
    ", the positional and photometric accuracy of extracted sources is meeting or even exceeding anticipated survey design specifications . *",
    "although this region of the sky has been previously targeted heavily by surveys of optically selected galaxies ( gavazzi _ et al . _",
    "2003 ) and was covered by both the hipass ( wong _ et al . _",
    "2006 ) and hijass ( davies _ et al . _",
    "2004 ) virgo cluster surveys , 69% of the hi detections presented here are new .",
    "the improvement over hipass in this region is a factor of 18 in the number density of hi detections .",
    "the galaxies detected by alfalfa include a population of gas - rich , star - forming low surface brightness galaxies which are not included in previous optical magnitude - limited surveys .",
    "* the median redshift of alfalfa in this region of the sky is @xmath8 7000 km  s@xmath5  , this depth may be compared to that of hipass : @xmath8 2800 km  s@xmath5  ( meyer _ et al . _  2004",
    "alfalfa samples volumes well beyond the local supercluster , and the distribution of hi detections follows the large scale structure evident in the region .",
    "eventually , we will use the alfalfa dataset to measure cosmological parameters such as the clustering properties of the hi population and its bias parameter , and to explore further the `` void problem '' ( peebles 2001 ) . *",
    "27 of the hi sources are identified with galaxies of early morphology , types e , de / sph or s0 .",

    "the alfalfa observations show that this feature is clearly connected to the nearby one - armed spiral ngc  4254 ; we discuss these observations in more detail elsewhere ( haynes _ et al . _  2007 , in preparation ) . * for  hi sources",

    "more than half of these are found at redshifts less than @xmath93 km  s@xmath5  and are likely to be perigalactic hvcs .",
    "particularly notable among them are the compact hvcs with positive velocities , a peculiar population in the vicinity of the north galactic pole .",
    "a number of the objects reported by de heij , braun & burton ( 2002 ) with fluxes close to the detection limit of that survey are not confirmed by the more sensitive alfalfa observations ( kent _ et al . _  2007 , in preparation ) .",
    "the objects with positive velocity which are confirmed , and a few previously undetected with similar velocities , lie in the same sky region as several distant perigalactic structures exhibiting positive velocities : the bootes dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( belokurov _ et al . _  2006a ; muoz",

    "we are in the process of investigating the interpretation of these features in more detail .",
    "* for some of the remaining objects without clear optical identifications , possible optical counterparts exist , but the positional accuracy of the alfalfa hi data is insufficient to yield an unambiguous identification .",
