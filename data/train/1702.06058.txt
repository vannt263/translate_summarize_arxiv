    "the imaging of anisotropic media from scattering data is a challenging problem mainly due to the non - uniqueness issue @xcite . yet , in many applications in medical imaging and non - destructive testing , the scattering media exhibit anisotropic properties in the interaction with probing waves . the so - called qualitative methods in inverse scattering @xcite provide imaging techniques to obtain information on changes in material properties of a known anisotropic media . this work concerns the imaging of small volume ( possibly anisotropic ) perturbations of a known anisotropic inhomogeneous media in acoustic wave propagation ( for the case of @xmath0 ) or specially polarized electromagnetic wave propagation ( for the case of @xmath1 ) . combining asymptotic analysis with music and the related transmission eigenvalue problem",
    "we derive a range test for the location of small perturbations and computable formulas that provide information about the strength ( involving the contrast and geometrical features ) of the small perturbation .",

    "one of the main contributions of this study is the asymptotic analysis of the transmission eigenvalue problem for anisotropic media with the first order correction term for the perturbation of the eigenvalues .",
    "note that the transmission eigenvalue problem is non - linear and non - selfadjoint , and the mathematical structure of this problem for anisotropic media is different from the isotropic case .",
    "in addition , we show how to use the asymptotic expansion for the perturbation of transmission eigenvalues together with the music algorithm to image small volume perturbations of anisotropic media .",
