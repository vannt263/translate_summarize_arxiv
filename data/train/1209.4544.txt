    "it has been reported recently that both the atlas and the cms experiments observed resonances in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 channels at around 125gev  @xcite .",
    "the resonance can naturally be interpreted as a signal of the higgs boson in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the mass range suggests that the higgs sector of the sm is fairly weakly coupled , perfectly consistent with the precision measurements at the lep experiments .",
    "the observation of the light higgs boson excludes various models of electroweak symmetry breaking via strong dynamics .",
    "for example , typical technicolor models  @xcite and their proposed effective descriptions such as the higgsless model  @xcite are in trouble with the weakly coupled descriptions of the higgs sector .",
    "there is , however , a logical possibility that the excess is not due to the higgs boson but rather a nambu - goldstone boson associated with an approximate scale invariance in the dynamical sector . in ref .",

    "it has been reported that the excess of events at around 126.5 ( 125 ) gev at atlas ( cms ) in the diphoton final state is enhanced from the expectation of the sm by a factor @xmath3 ( @xmath4 )  @xcite .",
    "though this tendency is not to the level of significance , it is noteworthy that the above stated models can naturally account for the trend .    if the excesses at around 125gev are due to such a non - higgs particle , one needs to consider a consistency with the constraints on the peskin - takeuchi @xmath5 and @xmath6 parameters  @xcite .",
    "this non - higgs scenario requires the real higgs boson ( if it exists ) to be heavier than @xmath7gev in order to be consistent with the lhc data , and such a heavy higgs boson does not give a good fit to the precision measurements .",
    "it is required to have some other contributions to the @xmath5 and @xmath6 parameters .",
    "since the models based on ( unknown ) technicolor theories or an extra dimension have no predictability or only weak predictability on the @xmath5 and @xmath6 parameters , it is difficult to judge if such models are really viable .    in this paper , we construct an effective ( minimal ) model of such a framework and see if there is a viable parameter region .",
    "the model consists of a massive vectorlike top partner fermion .",
    "the top partner mass @xmath8 represents a mass gap in the dynamical sector , to which the dilaton naturally couples in order to recover the scale invariance : @xmath9 .",
    "the coupling in turn provides interactions between the dilaton @xmath10 and the photons / gluons through loop diagrams of the top partners , explaining the excesses at the atlas and cms .",
    "the top partner can also contribute to the peskin - takeuchi @xmath5 , @xmath6 parameters , which turns out to be a good direction to come back to the allowed region , canceling the heavy sm higgs boson contribution to the @xmath6 parameter .",
    "we discuss whether such a dilaton explanation of the excesses is viable and how such a scenario can be discriminated by measuring various cross sections and decay branching ratios at the lhc experiments .",
    "the minimal model we study below catches essential features of dilaton / radion models , and the model parameters we discuss can easily be translated into those in other models .    in sec .",

    "[ dilaton at the lhc ] , we show signal strengths for all the higgs decay final states and give constraints on model parameters , namely a higgs - dilaton mixing angle @xmath11 and a dilaton decay constant @xmath12 , which is nothing but a vacuum expectation value of @xmath5 . in sec .",
    "[ top_constraints ] , constraints from the electroweak precision measurements are examined on the top partner sector , namely on the left - handed mixing @xmath13 between the top and its partner @xmath6 and on the heavier @xmath14 quark mass .",
    "the last section is devoted to summary and discussions .",
    "the dilaton field , defined as the nambu - goldstone particle associated with an approximate scale invariance of the theory , can be produced through the gluon fusion process at the lhc and can decay into two photons through the following effective operators : @xmath15 where @xmath10 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are the dilaton , the gluon field strength , and the photon field strength , respectively .",
    "these effective operators are generated if there is a colored and charged field which obtains mass through the spontaneous breaking of the approximate scale invariance .",
    "for example , in an approximately scale invariant technicolor theory , one can expect such operators to appear at low energy if there are colored and charged techniquarks .",
    "also , there can be a dual hadronic description of such a theory where the approximate scale invariance is nonlinearly realized .",
    "an example is a model with a warped extra dimension where @xmath10 represents the radius of the extra dimension . in either example , predictions to the effective couplings and also constraints from the electroweak precision measurements are pretty model dependent , and moreover , there are often technical difficulties in the estimations due to large nonperturbative effects or incalculable corrections from the cutoff scale physics .",
    "we , therefore , consider an effective minimal model of the dilaton , based on a weakly coupled renormalizable theory .",
    "the model allows us to perform explicit computations of the peskin - takeuchi @xmath5 , @xmath6 parameters and also production / decay processes of the dilaton at the lhc .",
    "this exercise not only provides us with a sense of how such a model is constrained , but is also practically useful since the obtained allowed range of parameters can easily be translated into other calculable models .",
    "the operators in eq .   are obtained by integrating out a field which is colored and charged .",
    "we choose the field to have the same quantum numbers as the right - handed top quark .",
    "this is somewhat a natural choice .",
    "when we consider the origin of the large top - quark mass , one may need to assume that the top quark is ( semi ) strongly coupled to a dynamical sector , such as in the topcolor  @xcite or the top seesaw models  @xcite .",
    "it is then reasonable to assume an existence of a resonance with the same quantum number as the top quarks .",
    "the resonance can decay into a bottom quark and a @xmath18 boson , and thus does not have a problem with a exotic stable state . as a minimal choice",
    ", we consider a vectorlike top partner with the same gauge quantum number as the right - handed @xmath19 singlet top quark rather than the left - handed doublet that also includes bottom quark partner .",
    "we write down the following lagrangian for the dilaton system : @xmath20 - v(\\phi , h ) ,      \\label{nonlinear_model}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the heavy vectorlike top partner representing the resonance , @xmath21 is the left - handed ( top and bottom ) quark doublet , and @xmath22 is the sm higgs doublet field .",
    "the lagrangian @xmath23 is the standard model , and the term with a coupling constant @xmath24 provides a mixing between the top quark and @xmath6 .",
    "the lagrangian has a nonlinearly realized scale invariance except for the scalar potential term @xmath25 which contains terms with small explicit breaking of the scale invariance .",
    "the potential terms provide mass terms for @xmath10 as well as a mixing between @xmath10 and the higgs boson .",
    "we choose the origin of the field @xmath10 so that @xmath26 .",
    "a mass term of @xmath27 , with @xmath28 being the right - handed top quark , can be eliminated by an appropriate field redefinition ; see appendix  [ top_mixing_section ]",
    ". it may be interesting to consider this model as the low - energy effective theory of the top condensation model  @xcite , where the coupling @xmath24 and the quartic coupling constant of the higgs field blows up simultaneously at a high - energy scale .",
    "we do not impose such a constraint in this paper in order to leave the discussion general .      by a field redefinition , @xmath29 the lagrangian given in eq .   is equivalent to @xmath30 - \\tilde v(s , h ) .",

    "the potential @xmath31 should be arranged so that @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath34 is shown in appendix  [ linear_realization_potential ] for completeness , though we do not need to specify it for the following analysis as we will be discussing with physical quantities such as the masses and mixings .",
    "we propose this lagrangian as a minimal effective description of an approximately scale invariant theory of ( dynamical ) electroweak symmetry breaking involving the only top and higgs sectors .",
    "if the mixing between the dilaton and the higgs boson is small and if the dilaton is the one which explains the observed resonance at the lhc , the higgs boson must be heavier than about @xmath35gev in order to be consistent with the higgs boson searches at the lhc .",
    "with such a heavy higgs boson , constraints from the peskin - takeuchi @xmath5 , @xmath6 parameters require a new contribution to come back to the ellipse in the @xmath5-@xmath6 plane .",
    "as we will see shortly , such a contribution is already there in this model since the loop diagrams of the @xmath36 field can push @xmath5 and @xmath6 parameters towards the right direction .",
    "this lagrangian , therefore , provides a compact realistic model of the light dilaton , which can be used for lhc studies .",
    "this model has new parameters in addition to the standard model ones .",
    "we here list them and their definitions :    * @xmath12 + this is the decay constant of the dilaton .",

    ", we define a dimensionless quantity , @xmath37 where @xmath38gev , and @xmath39 is the number of the @xmath6 fields .",
    "this parameter appears when we discuss the production and decay of @xmath10 . if necessary",
    ", one can obtain a large value of @xmath40 with a large number of @xmath41 without requiring too small @xmath12 .",
    "for the minimal model @xmath42 which we will assume hereafter .",
    "* @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath11 + these are masses ( @xmath45 ) and mixing of the scalar fields .",

    "i.e. , _ @xmath46 the higgs - dilaton mixing angle is defined as @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the lighter and the heavier mass eigenstates , respectively .",
    "we impose @xmath50 to be consistent with the data from lhc .",
    "when the mixing angle is so large that the lighter one is almost the standard model higgs boson , it is not necessary to impose the above constraint for a large @xmath12 . since we are particularly interested in a small mixing region , we always impose the above constraint in the following analysis .",

    "the mass matrix for the top quark and its partner , @xmath52 are diagonalized as @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the top quark mass .",
    "one can trade the new parameters @xmath24 and @xmath8 by the observables @xmath51 and @xmath13 , while @xmath55 should be adjusted to reproduce the top quark mass .",

    "the effective couplings for the production and decays of @xmath48 are approximated by momentum independent pieces which are insensitive to @xmath51 or @xmath13 .",

    "the terms proportional to @xmath66 and @xmath67 are contributions from the sm top and its partner , respectively .",
    "we can explicitly see that the coupling is independent of @xmath51 or @xmath13 .",

    "the first term in the parentheses is the contribution from the top partner loop whereas the second is from the sm top and @xmath18 ones .",

    "is generated at low energy if the whole standard model sector is a part of the scale invariant theory in the uv ; all the gauge bosons and fermions are composite particles .",
