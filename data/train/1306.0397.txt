    "the great control that can be exerted over cold molecules allows the study and manipulation of collisions and chemical reactions  @xcite .",
    "the strong dipole - dipole interactions between cold molecules make them excellent systems for quantum simulation and computation  @xcite . with their rich structure",
    ", molecules can be useful systems for making precision tests of fundamental physics , such as the measurements of the electron edm  @xcite and the search for time - variation of fundamental constants  @xcite .",
    "in particular this last application is of great interest to our group , and as a part of this research we are building a molecular fountain  @xcite .",
    "a fountain requires great control over the molecules , in our case slowing them from around 300 m / s to rest , cooling them , and then launching them upwards at around 3 m / s .",
    "a tool that has been successfully used to exert control over molecules is the stark decelerator  @xcite . while excellent at removing kinetic energy , a stark decelerator becomes lossy for low speeds ( @xmath0100 m/s ) because of its reliance on creating an effective 3d potential well .",
    "when the characteristic wavelength of the longitudinal and transverse motion becomes comparable to the periodicity of the decelerator , the approximations used to derive this effective well no longer apply and both the number of molecules and phase - space density decline with speed  @xcite . to avoid these losses at low speeds we use a traveling wave decelerator .",
    "based on the design of osterwalder et al  @xcite , this decelerator uses a sequence of ring - shaped electrodes to which a space- and time - varying voltage is applied . in this way",
    "the traveling wave decelerator creates a genuine rather than effective 3d trap that moves along the decelerator , co - propagating with the molecules . by reducing the speed of this co - moving trap",
    "the molecules are decelerated . the lowest speed reached by osterwalder et al was 120 m / s , limited by the lowest frequency at which the voltage could be varied .",
    "the same decelerator was used to slow ybf molecules from a buffer gas source from 300 m / s to 276 m / s , limited by the deceleration that could be applied to these heavy molecules  @xcite .",
    "a 5 m long traveling wave decelerator is currently under construction at the kvi in order to decelerate srf molecules  @xcite .",
    "we have recently been able to slow molecules to rest , and statically trap them inside the decelerator by using high voltage amplifiers that can sweep the high voltage from 15khz down to dc .",
    "we use a conventional stark decelerator to slow ammonia molecules from 300 m / s to around 100 m / s , removing 90% of their initial kinetic energy over a length of only 50 cm .",
    "we then load the molecules into the traveling wave decelerator for the remaining deceleration to standstill  @xcite .",

    ", the mean velocity of the beam is lowered to 300 m/s .",
    "the ammonia beam is decelerated using a 101-stage stark decelerator .",
    "adjacent stages are 5.5 mm apart .",
    "each deceleration stage is formed by two parallel 3 mm diameter cylindrical rods , spaced 2 mm apart .",
    "the two opposite rods are switched to @xmath4 and @xmath5kv by four independent hv switches that are triggered by a programmable delay generator .",
    "a traveling wave decelerator is mounted 24  mm above the last electrode pair .",
    "this decelerator consists of 336 ring electrodes , each of which is attached to one of eight 8  mm diameter stainless steel rods , resulting in a periodic array in which every ninth ring electrode is attached to the same rod .",
    "the rods are placed on a 26 mm diameter circle , forming a regular octagon .",
    "each rod is mounted by two ceramic posts that are attached to the octagon via an adjustable aluminum bar that allows for fine - tuning of the alignment .",
    "the ring - shaped electrodes are made by bending 0.6  mm thick tantalum wire into the shape of a tennis racket with an inner diameter of 4  mm .",
    "consecutive rings are separated by 1.5  mm ( center to center ) resulting in a periodic length of @xmath6 mm .",
    "this combination of parameters is identical to the design of osterwalder and co - workers  @xcite .",
    "the voltages applied to the eight support bars are generated by amplifying the output of an arbitrary wave generator ( wuntronic da8150 ) using eight fast hv - amplifiers ( trek 5/80 ) up to @xmath75  kv .",
    "a 50 cm long quadrupole is mounted 20 mm above the traveling wave decelerator .",
    "the quadrupole can be used for focusing slow molecules and to provide an extraction field for a wiley - mclaren type mass spectrometer setup . in the experiments described here , slow molecules are not focused and the quadrupole",
    "is used only to create the extraction field .",
    "the molecular beam overlaps with the focus of an uv laser 40 mm behind the last ring electrode of the decelerator to ionize the ammonia molecules .",
    "the nascent ions are counted by an ion detector .",
    "the chamber that houses the two decelerators and quadrupole guide is differentially pumped and kept at a pressure below @xmath8 mbar when the pulsed valve is operating .",

    "we will summarize those results that are relevant for the current paper .",
    "+ in order to describe the operation of a traveling wave decelerator , it is useful to consider the electric field inside an infinitely long hollow conducting cylinder to which a voltage is applied that is periodic in @xmath9 . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite the electric potential on the beam axis will in this case follow the potential applied to the cylinder , but it is reduced by a factor that depends on the radius of the cylinder and the periodic length of the applied waveform . the electric field magnitude in the longitudinal direction",
    "is given by a fully - rectified sine wave , resulting in two minima per period at the positions where the electric potential at the cylinder is maximal .",
    "at the position of these minima , the electric field magnitude in the radial direction is given by a first - order modified bessel function of the first kind .",
    "close to the minima the electric field increases linearly in both directions with the field gradient in the longitudinal direction being twice as large as the gradient in the radial direction .",
    "these minima will act as true 3d traps for weak - field seeking molecules . by modulating the waveform that is applied to the cylinder in time",
    ", the traps can be moved along the decelerator , while keeping a constant shape and depth .    in the actual implementation of the traveling wave decelerator ,",
    "8 ring - shaped electrodes are used to sample the infinite cylinder .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : setup_ring ] shows the electric field magnitude inside the traveling wave decelerator at a given time .",
    "the voltages applied to successive ring electrodes follow a sinusoidal pattern in @xmath9 shown on the right - hand side of the figure . in order to move the traps ,",
    "the sinusoidal waveform is modulated in time . as",
    "a consequence of using a finite number of electrodes , the trapping potential no longer maintains a constant shape and depth while it is moved . in the chosen geometry , the electric field gradients in the bottom of the well , as well as the trap depth in the longitudinal direction",
    "are nearly independent of the position of the trap minimum .",
    "the trap depth in the transverse direction , however , is 40% deeper when the trap minimum is located in the plane of a ring compared to the situation when the trap minimum is located directly between two rings .",
    "the potential @xmath10 applied to the @xmath11th electrode in the traveling wave decelerator can be expressed as  @xcite    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the amplitude of the sine - modulated potential and @xmath14 is a time - dependent phase offset that governs the motion of the traps . for the electric field configuration that is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup_ring ] , the phase offset has a value of @xmath15 .",
    "the angular frequency of the wave is given by the time derivative of @xmath16 ; @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the frequency in hz .",
    "since one oscillation of the waveform moves the trap over one period , the velocity of the trap is given by @xmath19 . integrating the angular frequency with respect to time results in the following expression for the phase    @xmath20    a linear increase of @xmath14 with time results in a trap that moves with a constant positive velocity along the @xmath9 axis .",
    "acceleration or deceleration of the trap can be achieved by applying a chirp to the frequency .",
    "the acceleration or deceleration of the trap changes the effective longitudinal potential experienced by the molecules . in order to account for this pseudoforce",
    ", an additional term of the form @xmath21 , with @xmath22 the mass of the molecule and @xmath23 the acceleration along the @xmath9 axis , is added to the potential . in fig .",
    "[ fig : effectivepotential ] , the resulting potentials are shown for different waveforms corresponding to different accelerations as indicated . the panels on the left- and right - hand side show the potential experienced by and molecules , respectively .",
    "the lower panels show the effective potential along the @xmath9-axis .",
    "the inversion splitting in nh@xmath24 is 23.8ghz , while it is only 1.6ghz in nd@xmath24 . as a result ,",
    "the stark effect in nh@xmath24 is quadratic up to electric fields of 20kv / cm and the effective potential for nh@xmath24 molecules is almost perfectly harmonic .",
    "the stark effect in nd@xmath24 , on the other hand , becomes linear at much smaller fields and the effective potential for nd@xmath24 molecules is harmonic close to the trap center only .",
    "note that in the figure the accelerations applied to are about 3 times larger than those applied to . as seen from the figure , acceleration of the trap",
    "reduces its phase - space acceptance and thus decreases the number of molecules that can be confined . above a certain threshold value ,",
    "the potential no longer contains a minimum and no molecules can be trapped at all .",
    "in addition to reducing the trap depth , acceleration of the trap results in a shift of the effective field minimum .",
    "this shift needs to be taken into account when the acceleration is not constant but a function of time , for instance , when the molecules are decelerated to a standstill and subsequently trapped at a certain position in the decelerator .",
    "we do this by rapidly ( @xmath25@xmath2s ) sweeping the phase of the waveform",
    ". we will refer to this sweep as a `` phase jump '' .",
    "in this section we present data that demonstrate the versatility of the traveling wave decelerator and analyze the performance of the setup under different conditions .",

    "section  [ sec : phasejumps ] discusses the use of the phase jump for and .    ]      in fig .",
    "[ fig : tofs ] , time - of - flight ( tof ) profiles of molecules ( upper panel ) and molecules ( lower panel ) are shown that were obtained by applying different waveforms to the traveling wave decelerator , as shown in the inset .",
    "note that the horizontal axis is shifted in such a way that the origin corresponds to the expected arrival time of the molecules . for each measurement , a packet of molecules",
    "is decelerated to 90 m/s using the conventional stark decelerator and subsequently coupled into the traveling wave decelerator .",
    "the violet curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : tofs ] are tof profiles for packets of and molecules that are guided through the traveling wave decelerator at the injection speed of 90 m/s by applying a waveform with a constant frequency of 7.5khz to the array of electrodes .",
    "the width of the tof profile mainly reflects the velocity spread of the guided molecules . for the moving trap is deeper than for , and its tof profile is accordingly wider .",
    "wings are observed at earlier and later arrival times , which are attributed to molecules that are trapped in the electric - field minima that are located @xmath26 mm above or below the synchronous one .    by adjusting the waveform that is applied to the traveling wave decelerator",
    ", the velocity of the molecules can be manipulated almost at will .",
    "the blue , green , and yellow traces in fig .",
    "[ fig : tofs ] are time - of - flight profiles for and molecules that are decelerated from 90 m/s to 60 , 10 and 0 m/s and immediately reaccelerated to 90 m/s .",
    "this corresponds to chirping the applied waveform from 7.5khz to 5.0 , 0.8 , and 0khz and results in accelerations of @xmath79.2 , @xmath716.4 , and @xmath27m / s@xmath28 , respectively .    the red curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : tofs ] show tof profiles that are obtained under almost identical conditions as the yellow curves .",
    "however , after the velocity of the applied waveform is decreased to 0 m/s , the voltages are kept at a constant values for 50ms before the velocity is increased to its original value of 90 m/s .",
    "it can be seen in the figure that the observed tofs are indeed almost identical to the ones recorded when the velocities are immediately returned to their original value .",
    "this measurement demonstrates that molecules can be trapped in the laboratory frame without further losses .",
    "the observed decrease in signal for nh@xmath24 and nd@xmath24 at higher accelerations is greater than expected from simulations .",
    "we attribute the loss mainly to mechanical misalignments that lead to parametric amplification of the motion of the trapped molecules at low velocities . on inspection",
    ", it was noticed that one of the suspension bars was slightly displaced from its original position , which must have happened when the decelerator was placed in the vacuum chamber .",
    "another loss mechanism comes from the fact that the phase space distribution of the packet exiting the conventional stark decelerator is not perfectly matched to the acceptance of the traveling wave decelerator , and the alignment of the axis of the traveling wave decelerator to the axis of the stark decelerator is not perfect . as a result , the trapped packet as a whole will perform a ( damped ) breathing and sloshing motion .",
    "these oscillations explain why the observed tof profile for deceleration to 60 m/s is wider and more intense than the tof profile for guided molecules .",
    "neither loss mechanism is fundamental , and we believe they can be eliminated in future work .    ]    as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] , the acceptance of the traveling wave decelerator depends on the chirp that is applied to the waveform .",
    "this is illustrated by the measurements that are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : accvssignal ] . in this figure , the time - integrated signal of ( squares ) and ( diamonds )",
    "molecules is plotted as a function of the applied acceleration . in these measurements ,",
    "ammonia molecules are guided at 90 m/s for 5 mm before being accelerated to 130 m/s and guided for the remaining length of the decelerator .    for comparison , the bold and thin solid lines shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : accvssignal ] correspond to simulations of the 1d and 3d acceptance of the traveling wave decelerator , respectively .",
    "the calculated acceptances are based on an average ( i.e. static in the moving frame of the trap ) potential well , rather than the true potential .",
    "the numbers on the right axis refer to the 3d acceptance , while the numbers on the left - hand axis refer to the 1d acceptance .",
    "the fact that the 1d and 3d simulations are almost the same , apart from a scaling factor , illustrates that the transverse acceptance is independent of the acceleration , i.e. , the transverse motion of the molecules in the traveling wave decelerator is largely decoupled from the longitudinal motion . the measurements for and",
    "have been scaled to match the simulations . as observed , at high acceleration",
    "the simulations predict the measurements quite well . at lower accelerations ,",
    "however , the measurements are seen to reach a constant value which is consistent with the expected longitudinal acceptance of the conventional stark decelerator at the used phase angle of 65 degrees  @xcite . at these accelerations",
    "the longitudinal acceptance of the traveling wave decelerator is larger than the longitudinal emittance of the packet exiting the stark decelerator ; i.e. , all molecules exiting the conventional stark decelerator are trapped in the traveling wave decelerator .",
    "consequently , decelerations below roughly @xmath29 m / s@xmath30 do not reduce the detected signal of and molecules .",
    "the dashed vertical line also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : accvssignal ] indicates the maximum acceleration that was used in the measurements shown in fig .",

    "figure  [ fig : positionscan ] shows the ( squares ) and ( diamonds ) signal as a function of this position .",
    "the signal oscillates with a periodicity that corresponds to the spacing between adjacent rings ; 1.5 mm equivalent to a phase difference of @xmath33 .",
    "the signal is largest when the ammonia molecules are trapped in the plane of an electrode , and smallest when the trap center is located between two electrodes .",

    "the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : phasejump ] shows the ( squares ) and ( diamonds ) signal as a function of the ( magnitude of the ) phase jumps that are applied whenever the acceleration is changed .",
    "as expected , the required phase jump for optimal signal is much larger for than for .",
    "in fact , when no phase jump is applied almost no signal is observed for , while for the signal hardly changes .",
    "the solid curves in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : phasejump ] show the result of 1d numerical simulations .",
    "although the simulations seem to slightly overestimate the width of the observed peaks and predict slightly greater phase jumps , the maximum and overall shape match the experimental data fairly well .",
    "the discrepancies might be caused by the fact that the amplifiers are not able to follow the rapid sweep of the phase perfectly .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : phasejump ] shows the longitudinal acceleration as a function of the position along the beam axis for and molecules using a waveform amplitude of 5kv .",
    "the electric field increases linearly away from the center of the trap resulting in a harmonic but shallow potential for and a tight but very anharmonic potential for .",

    "[ fig : cooling ] . in these measurements , molecules",
    "were decelerated using the conventional stark decelerator at phase angles of 60 and 53 degrees and coupled into the traveling wave decelerator .",
    "the traveling wave decelerator is subsequently used to slow the molecules to a standstill , trap them for a period of over 50ms , accelerate them back to their initial velocity and launch them into the detection region .",
    "while the molecules are trapped , the voltages applied to the decelerator are ramped down in 2ms , kept at a lower value for 10ms and then ramped up again to 5kv .",
    "figure  [ fig : cooling ] shows the remaining signal as a function of the reduced amplitude of the waveform for the two phase angles as indicated .",
    "typical waveform amplitudes as a function of time are shown in the inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : cooling ] . lowering the voltages of the trap",
    "has two effects : ( i ) the trap frequency is lowered , adiabatically cooling the molecules ; ( ii ) the trap depth is reduced , allowing the hottest molecules to escape the trap .",
    "the observed signal at a phase angle of 53 degrees is seen to drop more rapidly than that at a phase angle of 60 degrees .",
    "this is expected , as at lower phase angles a larger and hotter packet is loaded into the traveling wave decelerator .",
    "the hotter ensemble of molecules initially fills the trap almost completely while the colder molecules occupy only a fraction of the trap .",

    "[ fig : cooling ] also shows measurements where the trap voltages are abruptly ( 10@xmath2s ) lowered . in this case",
    "no adiabatic cooling occurs and as a result the signal decreases more rapidly than when the voltages are ramped to lower voltages more slowly .",

    "[ fig : tramp ] , the number of molecules that remain trapped at 2kv is shown as a function of the time used for lowering and increasing the voltages",
    ". the solid lines result from a 3d numerical simulation .",
    "the measurements confirm that the and molecules follow the trap adiabatically when the ramping times are longer than 1ms .",
    "the time required for the molecules to follow the change in potential adiabatically is greater for than it is for due to the lower trap frequencies experienced by the former .",
    "similar measurements have been performed on molecules in a microstructured trap by englert _ et .",

    "in this paper we have demonstrated deceleration and trapping of and molecules in a traveling wave decelerator .",
    "the observed trapping times are limited to 100ms by the current repetition rate of the experiment ( 10hz ) .",
    "the deceleration of a supersonic beam of ammonia molecules is performed in two steps ; in the first step , the molecules are decelerated from 300 to 100 m/s using a conventional stark decelerator , while in the second step , the traveling wave decelerator is used to remove the remaining kinetic energy from the molecules .",
    "the advantages of such a system are that the requirements imposed on the electronics of the traveling wave decelerator remain rather low , and that the combined length of both decelerators is only slightly above 1 m .",
    "the motion of the molecules in the traveling wave decelerator is controlled completely by computer generated waveforms . as an example of the possibilities offered by this control , we have adiabatically cooled the trapped molecules by lowering the amplitude of the waveforms . in previous work",
    ", we demonstrated that the motion of the molecules in the trap can be excited by applying an small oscillatory force  @xcite .",
    "the ability to control the voltages applied to the electrodes also offers the possibility to tailor the shape of the trap  for instance , changing it into a more box - like potential .",
