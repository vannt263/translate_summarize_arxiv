    "near water - equivalence@xcite , high spatial resolution and weak energy dependence across a broad range of energies@xcite make radiochromic film dosimetry with gafchromic films ( ashland inc . , wayne , nj ) and flatbed scanners the dosimetry system of choice for many applications in radiation therapy .",
    "radiochromic films darken upon irradiation , which makes it possible to measure the absorbed dose using a scanner .",
    "however , when they are digitized with a color scanner , three different dose distributions - one for each color channel - are obtained . to combine the information provided by all three channels into a single and more accurate dose distribution , multichannel dosimetry methods have been proposed@xcite .",
    "an emerging field of research in multichannel radiochromic film dosimetry are perturbation models@xcite .",
    "these models consider that , for each channel , the measured dose distribution deviates from the true absorbed dose distribution because of small perturbations in the film - scanner response . to combine all three color channels , certain assumptions on the characteristics of the perturbations are necessary .",
    "this approach has shown promising results @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this study is to select the most accurate model for radiochromic film dosimetry using gafchromic ebt2 and ebt3 films and a flatbed scanner . in order to do so , different channel independent perturbation ( chip ) models",
    "are compared .",
    "this work examines whether incorporating the information of the non - irradiated film , by scanning prior to irradiation , improves the dosimetry .",
    "to what extent perturbation models correct the deviation from the response at the center of the scanner along the axis parallel to the scanner lamp is analyzed .",
    "finally , single- , dual- and triple - channel models are compared to determine if by increasing the number of combined color channels the accuracy of radiochromic film dosimetry is also increased .",
    "the results of this study should be considered applicable within the limits under which the models were tested . through this work ,",
    "the films were irradiated with megavoltage radiotherapy beams , in the dose range from about 20 cgy to 600 cgy , and whole ( 8 @xmath0 @xmath1 10 @xmath0 ) films were scanned .",
    "the functional form of the sensitometric curves was a polynomial and the different lots were calibrated using the plan - based method @xcite .",
    "many disturbances affect the film - scanner response@xcite : thickness variations in the active layer coated on the film , electronic noise , scanner instability , lateral artifact , local variations produced by systematic problems of the scanner , newton rings , dust , scratches or other damage , etc . according to their persistence",
    ", disturbances can be classified into two groups : systematic local variations and random perturbations .",
    "random perturbations ( _ i.e. _ , noise ) are not consistent in time : they change or disappear between scan repetitions or between non - irradiated and irradiated film scans .",
    "electronic noise , scanner instability and newton rings can be included within this category .",
    "systematic variations are consistent between film scans .",
    "they include thickness variations in the active layer , lateral artifact , local variations produced by systematic problems of the scanner , etc .",
    "some other disturbances such as dust , scratches or other damage can be random or systematic , but they generally produce large alterations in the response , can not be treated as perturbations , and should be considered as another source of noise",
    ".    the dose absorbed by the film at point @xmath2 , @xmath3 , can be described by :    @xmath4    where @xmath5 represents the color channel ( _ i.e. _ , red ( r ) , green ( g ) or blue ( b ) ) , @xmath6 denotes the sensitometric curve ( for channel @xmath5 ) , @xmath7 is the film - scanner response ( either pixel value , optical density ( od ) or net optical density ( nod ) ) at point @xmath2 , @xmath8 corrects the systematic local variations and @xmath9 represents noise disturbances .",
    "if @xmath8 is small , we can apply a first - order taylor expansion of @xmath3 in terms of @xmath8 .",
    "hence , a general perturbation model for @xmath3 can be expressed as :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the first derivative of @xmath6 with respect to @xmath12 and @xmath13 is an error term that accounts for the difference between the true absorbed dose , @xmath3 , and the measured dose after correction of the perturbation .",
    "the noise is included in the error term .",
    "micke _ _ et al__@xcite were the first to suggest a perturbation model .",
    "mayer _ _ et al__@xcite found a closed - form solution to that model .",
    "they proposed a chip model :    @xmath14    which implicitly assumes that the probability density functions ( pdf ) of all the @xmath13 terms are equal and the pdf of @xmath15 is a uniform distribution@xcite .      in an earlier article@xcite , a generalization of the micke - mayer ( mm ) model was introduced .",
    "the pdf of @xmath15 was considered to be a truncated normal ( tn ) distribution and the @xmath13 terms could be different .    in this study ,",
    "the mm and tn models were compared while different elements of the functional form that translates film - scanner responses into doses were varied .",
    "it should be pointed out that the mm model is not the same as the micke or mayer multichannel film dosimetry methods .",
    "for example , the mayer method uses pixel value as film - scanner response , by contrast , in this study od and nod were used .",
    "the micke method uses a rational form for the sensitometric curves , by contrast , in this study the sensitometric curves followed    @xmath16    where @xmath17 are fitting parameters .",
    "however , both the micke and mayer methods share the same form of the perturbation , which diverges from the form defined by the tn model .",
    "the response of the dosimetry system to irradiation is expressed in terms of pixel value , od or nod .",
    "od is defined as :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 denotes the pixel values of the irradiated film and @xmath20 is the maximum possible pixel value of the scanner .",
    "between pixel value and od there is only a change of coordinates .",
    "for this reason , in this study pixel value was not included in the comparison .",
    "the information of the non - irradiated film can be incorporated in the response .",
    "nod is defined as :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 denotes the pixel values of the non - irradiated film .",
    "the lateral artifact is the deviation from the response at the center of the scanner along the axis parallel to the scanner lamp@xcite .",
    "it is caused by the interplay between the light scattering from the polymers created in the active layer of the film and the properties of the scanner@xcite .",
    "it is approximately parabolic in shape , with lower pixel values along the edges than at the center of the scan .",
    "it is dependent on the color channel and od .",
    "the lateral correction is modeled empirically . in this paper",
    ", lateral corrections are calculated as@xcite :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the pixel value before correction , @xmath25 is the coordinate of the pixel in the axis parallel to the ccd array , @xmath26 is the _ x _ coordinate of the center of the scanner , @xmath27 represents the corrected pixel value , and @xmath28 are fitting parameters .",
    "multichannel correction methods have been found to substantially mitigate the lateral artifact @xcite .",
    "this raises the question of whether additional steps to correct the lateral artifact are necessary .",
    "if the lateral correction is considered included in the perturbation term , additional steps are unnecessary .",
    "an alternative approach is to explicitly apply the lateral correction following eq.([lateral ] ) . in this study , both approaches were compared .",
    "multichannel dosimetry combines the doses measured with different color channels ( @xmath29 ) into a single dose value ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "considering @xmath29 as different measurements of the dose , if they were uncorrelated the uncertainty of the dose @xmath30 could not be higher than the uncertainties of each of the channels separately .",
    "however , they are correlated @xcite , which implies that the uncertainty of @xmath30 can be higher than the uncertainty of @xmath29 .",
    "thus , multichannel dosimetry is not necessarily better than single - channel dosimetry .",
    "it depends , first , on the functional form of the particular multichannel model . according to the functional form",
    ", it can be derived that the uncertainty of the chip models compared in this work can not worsen when the number of combined channels increases .",
    "second , this is only valid if the functional form correctly describes the physics of radiochromic film dosimetry .    in this study ,",
    "single- , dual- and triple - color - channel dosimetry models were compared .",
    "the most accurate model for radiochromic film dosimetry will be the one with the highest degree of coincidence between the film dose ( @xmath30 ) and the true dose ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the degree of coincidence is a qualitative magnitude , in this work it was quantified as the probability of both being equal .    according to bayesian probability theory ,",
    "given the measured data , the probability that a model is the one where the data come from is proportional to the probability of obtaining these data from the model times the prior probability of the model : @xmath31 .",
    "the ideal choice for the prior is the universal weight based on the kolmogorov complexity of the model@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the kolmogorov complexity is not finitely computable .",
    "a practical complexity - based approach consists of selecting the model using the akaike information criterion ( aic)@xcite .",
    "thus , the most probable model is the one with the lowest aic value : @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the number of parameters of the model .",
    "usually , when selecting a model for film dosimetry , the functional form is predefined and the only parameters to select fit the lateral corrections and sensitometric curves . this",
    "is done for each lot of films and is referred to as ` calibration ' . in this study , the functional form ( mm or tn , od or nod , etc . )",
    "had to be selected as well .",
    "each lot of films was calibrated with each functional form . for each calibration , to calculate @xmath34 , it was considered that the differences ( @xmath35 ) between the reference doses ( @xmath3 ) and measured doses ( @xmath30 ) were normally distributed .",
    "thus , and considering that the number of parameters was negligible compared to the size of the data sample , the model with the lowest root mean square error ( rmse ) comparing the reference and measured doses was regarded as the most likely model .",
    "therefore , given a functional form , the parameters of the model were selected minimizing the rmse . in addition , for each lot , the most probable functional form was given by the model with the lowest rmse .    henceforth , a given use of the term ` model ' will refer to all those models with the same functional form .",
    "a calibration will select the parameters that maximize the likelihood of that model .    to exclude the possible dependence on a particular lot ,",
    "a sample with four different lots was employed .",
    "calibrations of different lots had different dose ranges and quantities of data .",
    "to balance their weights , relative rather than absolute differences were compared . for each calibration , it was assumed that the relative differences between reference doses ( @xmath3 ) and measured doses ( @xmath30 ) were also normally distributed :    @xmath36    with :    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is referred to as the relative ` uncertainty of the calibration ' . to estimate the uncertainty of the measured dose ,",
    "@xmath38 should be combined with the uncertainty of @xmath3 .    in information theory ,",
    "entropy is defined as the expected negative log - likelihood of a random variable .",
    "hence , maximizing the likelihood of a model is equivalent to minimizing the information entropy of the errors .",
    "the ( differential ) entropy of a model following eq.([relative_unc ] ) can be calculated as :    @xmath39    assigning the same weight to each lot , the entropy of a model in a sample of lots is the mean entropy of the model in the sample . as a result , it was considered that the most probable model for radiochromic film dosimetry was the one with the lowest geometric mean of the calibration uncertainty for all lots under study .",
    "gafchromic ebt2 and ebt3 films with dimensions 8 @xmath0 @xmath1 10 @xmath0 were used .",
    "they were handled in conformity to the recommendations of the aapm tg-55 report @xcite .",
    "the films were scanned with an epson expression 10000xl flatbed scanner ( seiko epson corporation , nagano , japan ) prior to irradiation and within the time - window following irradiation .",
    "the scanner was warmed up for at least 30 min before use . before acquisitions , and after long pauses ,",
    "five empty scans were taken to stabilize the scanner lamp .",
    "the films were centered on the scanner with a black opaque cardboard frame .",
    "they were scanned in portrait orientation ( _ i.e. _ , the short side of the film parallel to the scanner lamp and the long side parallel to the lamp movement axis ) .",
    "scans were acquired with image - type set to 48-bit rgb ( 16 bit per channel ) , a resolution of 72 dpi and image processing tools turned off .",
    "they were saved as tiff files .",
    "five consecutive scans were taken for each film and the first scan was discarded to avoid the warm - up effect of the scanner lamp occurring with multiple scans@xcite .      to calibrate a lot according to the models under comparison , a set of reference doses should be associated with a representative sample of responses , lateral positions and perturbations .    to obtain a representative calibration sample ,",
    "the plan - based method was chosen @xcite .",
    "films were placed in a plastic water ( computerized imaging reference systems inc .",
    "norfolk , va , usa ) phantom at source - axis distance ( sad ) .",
    "they were irradiated with a 6 mv photon beam and a @xmath40 enhanced dynamic wedge field of dimensions 20@xmath120 @xmath41 at sad .",
    "the range of doses delivered to the film encompassed the range of doses of interest .",
    "for some lots , the irradiation was repeated with several films and different monitor units ( mu ) . in this way , the dose range was extended and the intralot variability mitigated .",
    "the dose distribution in the plane of the film was either calculated with the treatment planning system ( tps ) or , preferably , measured simultaneously with an iba matrixx evolution ionization chamber array ( iba dosimetry gmbh , germany ) . since the reference dose plane can be either planned or measured , from now on this method will be referred to as the ` plane - based ' method .",
    "the plane - based method is an alternative to the well - established calibration method with fragments@xcite .",
    "a disadvantage of the plane - based method is that the reference doses have higher uncertainty than with the calibration with fragments .",
    "however , better precision in the reference dose is useless if the calibration sample is biased .",
    "the plane - based method provides a more representative calibration sample , making it more robust against perturbations .",
    "additionally , another advantage of the plane - based method is the efficiency , since the time required for calibration is considerably reduced .",
    "four lots were used , two of them with ebt2 films : lot a04141003bb ( lot a ) and lot a03171101a ( lot b ) ; and the other two with ebt3 : lot a05151201 ( lot c ) and lot a03181301 ( lot d ) .",
    "they were calibrated following slightly different variations of the protocol :    the lot a films were irradiated at a depth of 6 cm in a 12@xmath130@xmath130 @xmath42 phantom in slab form with a novalis tx accelerator ( varian , palo alto , ca , usa ) .",
    "one film was irradiated with a wedge field with 660 mu ( the reference doses extended from 100 cgy to 600 cgy , approximately ) .",
    "the reference dose plane was calculated with eclipse v.10.0 ( varian medical systems ) using the anisotropic analytical algorithm ( aaa ) .",
    "the films were scanned in reflection mode and the waiting time - window was 24 @xmath43 1 h.    the lot b and lot c films were irradiated atop the iba matrixx detector inside the iba matrixx evolution multicube with a novalis tx accelerator .",
    "three films were used for the calibration , two of them were irradiated with a wedge field with 535 mu ( dose range : 75 - 400 cgy , approximately ) and the other one with a wedge with 401 mu ( dose range : 50 - 300 cgy , approximately ) .",
    "the reference doses were measured simultaneously .",
    "the films were scanned in reflection and transmission mode .",
    "the time - window was 20 @xmath43 1 h.    the lot d films were also irradiated and measured with iba matrixx evolution . they were irradiated with a varian 2100 cd accelerator .",

    "the films were scanned in transmission mode and the time - window was 24 @xmath43 1 h.    whenever the reference doses were measured with the detector array , the dose values were scaled with a factor of 1.015 in order to correct for the distance between the plane of the film and the plane of measurement of the detector .",
    "when the reference doses were calculated with the tps , they were corrected with the daily output of the linac .",
    "the reference dose planes were exported ( with a resolution of 0.49 mm / px for the planned doses and 7.62 mm / px for doses measured with matrixx ) .",

    "44 different models for radiochromic film dosimetry were compared for each of the calibration samples . since radiochromic.com optimizes the calibrations using an evolutionary algorithm , each calibration was repeated three times and the one with the lowest uncertainty was selected .      given the calibration sample , the model with the lowest calibration uncertainty was considered the most accurate one .",

    "<S> * abstract : *     the purpose of this study was to find the most accurate model for radiochromic film dosimetry by comparing different channel independent perturbation models . a model selection approach based on ( algorithmic ) information theory </S>",
    "<S> was followed , and the results were validated using gamma - index analysis on a set of benchmark test cases . </S>",
    "<S> several questions were addressed : ( a ) whether incorporating the information of the non - irradiated film , by scanning prior to irradiation , improves the results ; ( b ) whether lateral corrections are necessary when using multichannel models ; ( c ) whether multichannel dosimetry produces better results than single - channel dosimetry ; ( d ) which multichannel perturbation model provides more accurate film doses . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that scanning prior to irradiation and applying lateral corrections improved the accuracy of the results . </S>",
    "<S> for some perturbation models , increasing the number of color channels did not result in more accurate film doses . employing truncated normal perturbations </S>",
    "<S> was found to provide better results than using micke - mayer perturbation models . among the models </S>",
    "<S> being compared , the triple - channel model with truncated normal perturbations , net optical density as the response and subject to the application of lateral corrections was found to be the most accurate model . </S>",
    "<S> the scope of this study was circumscribed by the limits under which the models were tested . in this study </S>",
    "<S> , the films were irradiated with megavoltage radiotherapy beams , with doses from about 20 cgy to 600 cgy , entire ( 8 @xmath0 @xmath1 10 @xmath0 ) films were scanned , the functional form of the sensitometric curves was a polynomial and the different lots were calibrated using the plane - based method . </S>"
