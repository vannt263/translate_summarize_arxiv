    "surface critical phenomena are subject of increased current experimental interest . after the confirmation of some of the theoretical predictions @xcite in x - ray scattering experiments with feal @xcite , the more recent efforts focussed on binary mixtures near their consolute point @xcite and near - critical fluids @xcite .",
    "while for instance the diffuse scattering of ( evanescent ) x - rays is governed by the two - point correlation function , in the experiments on fluids the order parameter ( op ) , the concentration difference in fluid mixtures or the density difference between liquid and gaseous phase in single - component fluids , plays a central role .",
    "for instance the reflectivity and ellipticity measured in light - scattering experiments are directly related to the op profile@xcite .",
    "hence , a precise quantitative information about the local behavior of these quantities is required to interpret the experimental data .    in the framework of continuum field theory such as the @xmath2 model ( belonging to the universality class as the ising model )",
    "the surface influence is taken into account by additional fields like the surface magnetic field @xmath0 and the local temperature perturbation @xmath1 at @xmath5 .",
    "the latter can be related to the surface enhancement of the spin - spin coupling in lattice models @xcite . at the bulk critical temperature , @xmath6 ,",
    "the tendency to order near the surface can be reduced ( @xmath7 ) , increased ( @xmath8 ) , or , as a third possibility , the surface can be critical as well ( corresponding to a particular value of @xmath1 ) . as a result",
    ", each bulk universality class in general divides into several distinct _ surface universality classes _ , corresponding to the fixed points of the renormalization - group flow and labelled as ordinary ( @xmath9 ) , extraordinary ( @xmath10 ) , and special transition ( @xmath11 ) .    while a very well - developed theory for the individual universality classes exists , the picture in the crossover regions between the fixed points is less complete . in particular in view of some of the experiments",
    ", it may not be justified to consider the system to be at a fixed point , and so a detailed understanding of the crossover regions is of special importance .",
    "additionally the physics away from the fixed points is much richer and more interesting as certain length scales emerge , may become macroscopic , and compete with the bulk correlation length , whereas with the surface fields at their fixed - point values these scales are typically zero or infinity .    near the special transition",
    "these phenomena were studied already some time ago@xcite .",
    "it was realized that @xmath0 gives rise to a length scale @xmath12 and the singular behavior of thermodynamic quantities goes through different universal regimes .",
    "this is best illustrated by the spatial dependence of the op @xmath13 . for distances large",
    "compared to all length scales it was known that @xmath13 should decay as @xmath14 @xcite , where the exponent @xmath15 is the _ scaling dimension _ of the field @xmath16 .",
    "this power law describes the asymptotic long - distance decay at @xmath17 when the symmetry in the surface is broken spontaneously or explicitly , i.e. at the extraordinary or normal transition , respectively@xcite .",
    "for instance for the @xmath18 ising model @xmath19 @xcite . for @xmath20",
    "( but still much larger than microscopic scales ) , on the other hand , the result found in refs.@xcite was that @xmath13 should behave as @xmath21 .",
    "again , in the three - dimensional ising model the monte carlo literature value for this combination of exponents is @xmath22 @xcite , whereas in mean - field ( mf ) theory it is zero .",
    "thus , at the special transition , if fluctuation are taken into account , the decay of @xmath13 is still monotonic , however , it is described by different power laws for @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "a similar phenomenon was recently pointed out for the case of large @xmath1 , i.e. a situation near the ordinary transition@xcite . for @xmath25 the scaling field is given by @xmath26 @xcite ( where @xmath27 is a positive exponent to be discussed below in more detail ) and the length scale induced by this field is @xmath28 .",
    "the short - distance behavior of the magnetization is given by @xmath29 with @xmath30 .",
    "this time the value of the short - distance exponent , @xmath31 , is in general positive , such that the op turns out to be a",
    "_ non - monotonic _ function of @xmath32 . in the ising model @xmath33 , whereas in mf theory , like at the special transition , one has @xmath34 . at @xmath35",
    "again the crossover to the  normal \" behavior @xmath36 takes place .",
    "the near - surface growth of order at the ordinary transition was recently also corroborated by monte carlo simulations@xcite .",
    "moreover , it was pointed out that in a system with @xmath25 and non - vanishing @xmath0 , it might be the generic case that length scale @xmath37 becomes macroscopic and comparable or even larger than the bulk correlation length @xmath38@xcite .",
    "the behavior of thermodynamic quantities near the surface is then governed by exponents of the ordinary transition . as a consequence , for @xmath39 the amount of adsorbed order as a function of @xmath40",
    "is described by the power law @xmath41 @xcite , in very good agreement with experiments @xcite .",
    "only much closer to the critical point a crossover to @xmath42 takes place , as expected for the normal transition and assumed in previous studies .",
    "the main purpose of our present work is a careful derivation of the op scaling function for the crossover between ordinary and normal transition in the framework of renormalization - group improved perturbation theory .",
    "while the respective studies in ref.@xcite focussed on the near - surface behavior , and the monte carlo simulations of ref.@xcite were hampered by strong finite - size effects and did not yield op profiles suitable for the comparison with experimental data , the results presented below give to one - loop order the op profiles for the semi - infinite system .",
    "further we present mf results for the structure function , relevant for scattering of x - rays for example , in the regime between ordinary and normal transition .",
    "eventually we discuss the crossover between special and ordinary transition that ( while probably less important in view of experiments ) is an interesting and technically demanding problem in perturbation theory .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in sec.[background ] we discuss the behavior of thermodynamic quantities from the viewpoint of a scaling analysis , give an heuristic argument for the growth of order at the ordinary transition , and compare with the situation in critical dynamics where analogous phenomena occur after temperature quenches . in sec.[0loop ] , as the building blocks for the perturbative calculation , we present the results of the mf ( zero - loop ) theory .",
    "especially the correlation function for general @xmath1 and @xmath0 is discussed in some detail , and the structure function for critical diffuse scattering is calculated numerically from that result . in sec.[1loop ] the op profiles are calculated to one - loop order , and special emphasis is put on the crossovers between ordinary and normal transition and special and ordinary transition , respectively .",
    "in this section we study the behavior of thermodynamic variables with the help of a phenomenological scaling analysis . as the most instructive example , we discuss the local behavior op for different surface universality classes and the various crossovers . certain aspects of the scaling behavior of the correlation function will be treated in sec.[0loop ] .",
    "since the parameter @xmath1 has to be fine tuned in addition to @xmath40 , from the viewpoint of the experimentalist the special transition is certainly the most exotic among the surface universality classes . however , from the viewpoint of the scaling analysis it is the most straighforward case .",
    "near the special transition @xmath0 and @xmath43 are the linear scaling fields pertaining to the surface . in the critical regime thermodynamic quantities",
    "are described by homogeneous functions of the scaling fields .",
    "let us consider the op for small @xmath0 and @xmath44 .",
    "its behavior under rescaling of distances should be described by @xmath45 where all exponents have their standard meaning@xcite . in general",
    "the surface exponent @xmath46 occurring in ( [ scalsp1 ] ) has different values for different surface universality classes@xcite , and therefore it has been marked by ` _ sp _ '",
    "( for special ) .",
    "removing the arbitrary rescaling parameter @xmath47 in eq.([scalsp1 ] ) by setting it @xmath48 , one obtains the scaling form of the magnetization @xmath49 where @xmath50 are the length scales determined by @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the other length scale pertinent to the semi - infinite system and occurring in ( [ scalspm ] ) is the bulk correlation length @xmath51 .    in order to discuss the various asymptotic cases ,",
    "let us set @xmath52 for simplicity .",
    "in other words , we assume for the moment that the bulk correlation length is much larger than any length scale set by the surface fields , in which limit the scaling function @xmath53 in ( [ scalspm ] ) becomes @xmath54 further below we will discuss modifications due to finite @xmath38 .",
    "let us first consider the case @xmath55 where both bulk and surface are in the critical state at @xmath17 .",
    "then the only remaining length scale is @xmath56 and the op profile can be written in the scaling form @xmath57    as mentioned in the introduction , for @xmath24 the magnetization decays as @xmath58 and , thus , @xmath59 should approach a constant for @xmath60 . in order to work out the _ short - distance _ behavior , we demand that @xmath61 when @xmath32 is small ( but still larger than microscopic scales ) .",
    "this is motivated by and consistent with the field - theoretic short - distance expansion @xcite , where , on a more fundamental level , _ field operators _ near a boundary are represented in terms of boundary operators multiplied by @xmath1-number functions .",
    "now , the dependence of @xmath4 on @xmath0 is given by @xmath62 , and with the scaling relation @xmath63 we obtain that the scaling function @xmath59 in ( [ h1 ] ) should behave as @xmath64 in the limit @xmath65 .",
    "inserting this in ( [ h1 ] ) leads to the short - distance behavior @xmath66 in agreement with refs.@xcite .",
    "in other words : near the special transition a small @xmath0 gives rise to a macroscopic regime near the surface of depth @xmath56 on which the behavior of the op is governed by an exponent different from the one describing the long distance behavior for @xmath67 .",
    "for the three - dimensional ising model the short - distance exponent @xmath68 is negative , its ( mc ) literature value being @xmath69 @xcite ( compared with @xmath70 @xcite that governs the decay for @xmath67 ) .    next let us consider the case of _ large _",
    "@xmath1 , near the ordinary transition , the situation which is more natural if one thinks of possible applications for experiments and which was discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "since @xmath1 is a so - called _ dangerous irrelevant variable _ it must not be simply set to @xmath71 from the start@xcite .",
    "a careful analysis reveals that close to the ordinary transition the linear scaling field is given by @xmath72 with @xmath73 . in mf theory the value of the exponent @xmath74 .",
    "further , it is discussed in detail in ref.@xcite that in the framework of the @xmath3 expansion one does not capture the deviation from the mf value in this exponent , while e.g. the @xmath32-dependence of expectation values is reproduced correctly .",
    "analogous to ( [ scalsp1 ] ) , also near the ordinary transition the magnetization is a homogenous function of the linear scaling fields : @xmath75 removing @xmath47 by setting it @xmath48 and setting @xmath52 again , one obtains the scaling form @xmath76 where @xmath77 is in this case the only length scale determined by the surface fields .    in order to analyze the short - distance behavior of the magnetization , we demand again that @xmath78 . since for large @xmath1 the surface is paramagnetic and responds linearly to a small external field , we have now @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "the immediate consequence of the simple _ linear _ response for the scaling function @xmath80 occurring in ( [ scalordm ] ) is that it has to behave as @xmath81 for @xmath65 . inserting this in ( [ scalord1 ] ) , we obtain that for @xmath82 the magnetization is described by @xmath83 using that @xmath84 and @xmath85 together with the scaling relation @xmath86 , one obtains @xmath87 .    in the mf approximation",
    "the result for @xmath31 is zero .",
    "however , a positive value and , consequently , a non - monotonic profile are obtained when fluctuations are taken into account below the upper critical dimension @xmath88 . the numeric value of @xmath31 is 0.21 , where we have used the monte carlo literature value @xmath89 for @xmath90 @xcite together with the scaling relation @xmath91@xcite .      in the previous section we discussed the behavior of the op in situations where @xmath11 and @xmath92 and where @xmath93 . in both cases",
    "we found a near - surface behavior governed by the exponents of the special or ordinary transition , respectively , and a crossover to the power law @xmath36 characteristic for the normal transition .",
    "however , the scaling form ( [ scalspm ] ) should also describe the behavior of @xmath13 in the general case , in the presence of two length scales , and , in particular , it should cover the crossover between `` special '' and `` ordinary '' near - surface behavior .",
    "let us assume that @xmath0 is fixed and vary @xmath1 between @xmath94 and @xmath71 such that the length scale @xmath95 ranges from @xmath71 and @xmath96 .",
    "first , in the limit @xmath97 we were lead from ( [ scalc ] ) to ( [ h1 ] ) . due to the fact that the linear scaling field at the ordinary transition is a combination of the surface parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 ,",
    "the second limit , @xmath98 , is more subtle . in this limit the scaling function @xmath99 in ( [ scalc ] ) should behave as @xmath100 where @xmath101 such that the product in the argument of @xmath102 on the right - hand side of ( [ lim2 ] ) is just @xmath103 .",
    "although experimentally a system where both scales @xmath37 and @xmath95 are macroscopic is probably not realizable , in the field - theoretic model to be analyzed below there is no principle limitation .",
    "so at least from the theoretical point of view it is an interesting question to ask what shape the op profiles have in the crossover regime between special and ordinary transition . in the following",
    "we present a qualitative scenario that , to our present knowledge , describes this crossover .    consider a system with fixed @xmath0 and variable @xmath95 . as long as @xmath104 , the asymptotic behavior for small distances , @xmath105 ,",
    "is described by ( [ shodisp ] ) where the amplitude of the short - distance power law does not depend on @xmath1 . on the other hand , for distances large",
    "compared to all scales induced by @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the op profile should behave as @xmath14 , again with an amplitude independent of @xmath1 ( and @xmath0 ) .",
    "more precisely , the crossover to the ",
    "normal \" behavior takes place at a distance @xmath106 that varies between @xmath56 for @xmath11 and @xmath37 for large @xmath1 .",
    "the qualitative shape of the crossover profiles is depicted in fig.1 .",
    "as long as @xmath107 , the op is a monotonic function of @xmath32 , with a single crossover at @xmath108 . for @xmath109 , however , the profile becomes non - monotonic and exhibits several crossovers .",
    "for @xmath110 it first drops and thereafter increases again to approach the long - distance power law .",
    "for @xmath111 eventually the increase for @xmath112 must approach the power law ( [ power ] ) .",
    "of course , in this limit it would be appropriate to rescale the @xmath32-axis or readjust @xmath0 such that @xmath37 remains finite .",
    "# 1#20.6#1      as for the op in the previous sections , a similar scaling analysis combined with arguments taken from short - distance expansions can also be carried out for the correlation function . here",
    "we restrict ourself to a qualitative discussion of the two - point correlation function in directions parallel to the surface , called parallel correlation function in the following , for a system with large @xmath1 .",
    "this function is useful to illustrate the general features one has to expect for correlation functions in the crossover regimes and later on it is needed for an heuristic argument that explains the near - surface growth expressed in ( [ power ] ) .",
    "further , we restrict the discussion again to the case @xmath52 .    # 1#20.6#1    the different regimes which",
    "the parallel correlation function @xmath113 ( where @xmath114 denotes the distance between two point in a plane parallel to the surface ) goes through are depicted in fig.2 .",
    "first of all , for @xmath115 the function @xmath116 asymptotically behaves as in the bulk , @xmath116 is governed by the bulk exponent @xmath117 ( lower light gray area ) . in the opposite case , @xmath118",
    ", the result depends on whether the distance from the surface is smaller or larger than the length scale @xmath37 introduced in ( [ lengthord ] ) . in the case",
    "@xmath119 for @xmath120 the crossover from bulk to surface behavior takes place , where @xmath116 is governed by the anomalous dimension of the normal transition ( upper light gray area ) .",
    "the situation for @xmath121 is different .",
    "again at @xmath120 a crossover to surface behavior takes place , to a regime @xmath122 where the behavior is governed by exponents of the _ ordinary _ transition ( dark gray area ) . eventually , for @xmath123 the crossover to the regime with ",
    "normal \" behavior takes place . in fig.2",
    "the crossover regions are represented as white areas .    as we shall see in sec.[scatter ] , this crossover behavior leads to the result that for instance in scattering with finite penetration depth of the radiation and @xmath37 greater than this depth , the structure function is effectively governed by exponents of the ordinary transition .",
    "the scaling analysis presented above can be straightforwardly extended to the case @xmath125 . in @xmath126",
    ", we may assume that the behavior near the surface for @xmath127 is unchanged compared to ( [ shodisp ] ) and ( [ power ] ) .",
    "the behavior farther away from the surface depends on the ratio @xmath128 , where @xmath129 stands for @xmath56 or @xmath37 . in the case of @xmath130",
    "a crossover to an exponential decay will take place for @xmath131 and the regime of nonlinear decay @xmath14 does not occur . for @xmath132 a crossover to the power - law decay",
    "@xmath14 takes place for @xmath133 and finally at @xmath131 the exponential behavior sets in .",
    "similar results hold for the correlation functions .",
    "as long as for example the distance @xmath114 in the parallel correlation function is smaller than @xmath38 , the discussion of sec.[correl ] holds . for distances larger than @xmath38 correlations decay",
    "exponentially .    an interesting phenomenon can be observed in the case @xmath134 . as said above",
    ", @xmath13 then never reaches the regime with power - law decay , but crosses over from the near - surface regime directly to the exponential decay .",
    "let us restrict the further discussion to the case of the ordinary transition .",
    "since the region where @xmath13 grows then only extends up to the distance @xmath38 , the maximum of the op profile has roughly the value @xmath135 , where the exponent @xmath31 was defined in ( [ power ] ) .",
    "now , the amplitude of the exponential decay should behave as @xmath136 such that for @xmath137 we have @xmath138 in other words , in the case @xmath139 the exponent @xmath31 not only governs the behavior of @xmath13 near the surface , but also leaves its fingerprint much farther away of an universal dependence of the amplitude of the exponential decay .",
    "nothing comparable occurs when @xmath140 ( compare sec.[scalan ] above ) , where all profiles approach the same curve @xmath141 for @xmath142 , with an amplitude @xmath143 independent of @xmath0 .",
    "a similar phenomenon , termed `` long - time memory '' of the initial condition , does also occur in critical dynamics for @xmath144 @xcite .",
    "the analogies between surface critical phenomena and critical dynamics will be discussed in more detail in the next section .",
    "the _ spatial _ variation of the magnetization discussed so far , especially the increasing profile at the ordinary transition , strongly resembles the _ time _ dependence of the op in relaxational processes at the critical point .",
    "if a system with nonconserved op ( model a ) is quenched for example from a _ high - temperature initial state _ to the critical point , with a small initial magnetization @xmath145 , the op behaves as @xmath146 @xcite , where the short - time exponent @xmath147 is governed by the difference between the scaling dimensions of initial and equilibrium magnetization divided by the dynamic ( equilibrium ) exponent@xcite . like the exponent @xmath31 in ( [ power ] ) , the exponent @xmath147 vanishes in mf theory , but becomes positive below @xmath148 .",
    "for example , its value in the three - dimensional ising model with glauber dynamics is @xmath149 @xcite .",
    "the high - temperature initial state of the relaxational process is to some extent analogous to the surface that strongly disfavors the order and that ( for @xmath150 ) belongs to the universality class of the ordinary transition . further expanding this analogy , heating",
    "a system from a low - temperature ( ordered ) initial state to the critical point would be similar to the situation at the extraordinary transition .",
    "eventually , analogous to the special transition would be a `` relaxation process '' that starts from an equilibrium state at @xmath17 .",
    "motivated by the analogy between surface critical phenomena and critical dynamics , an heuristic argument for the short - distance growth of the op at the ordinary transition behavior can be brought forward . in relaxation processes , after the system has passed through a non - universal regime immediately after the quench , the growth of correlation length @xmath151 is described by a power law .",
    "analogously one may argue that in the static case in the surface - near regime there exists an effective parallel correlation length @xmath152 that grows as @xmath48 when the distance @xmath32 grows away from the surface . as discussed in sec.[correl ] , for lateral distance @xmath120 the parallel correlation function crosses over from `` bulk '' to  surface decay \" , the latter being much faster than the former ( compare sec.[scatter ] ) .    for the sake of the argument , consider the semi - infinite ising system at bulk criticality where initially @xmath150 with the tendency to order in the surface reduced compared with the bulk .",
    "if then a small @xmath0 is imposed on the surface , a number of spins will change their orientation to generate a small @xmath4 .",
    "now , the magnetization induced by in a distance @xmath32 from the surface is determined by several factors .",
    "first , it is proportional to @xmath4 and , in turn , for small @xmath4 , it is proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "second , it should be proportional to the _ perpendicular _ correlation function @xmath153 which says how much of a given surface configuration  survives \" in a distance @xmath32 .",
    "eventually , it should be proportional to the correlated area in the distance @xmath32 that is influenced by a single surface spin . according to the discussion above",
    ", the latter grows as @xmath154 . taking these factors together we obtain @xmath155 in agreement with the short - distance law ( [ power ] ) .",
    "the above argument holds as long as @xmath32 and @xmath4 are small enough .",
    "if @xmath32 is larger than the average distance between the spins flipped , the correlated areas start to overlap and the above argument breaks down .",
    "this is where the crossover to the normal transition sets in .",
    "from the field - theoretical point of view in both cases ( surface critical phenomena and critical dynamics ) the modified power laws are due to additional short - distance or short - time singularities near spatial or temporal boundaries . in both cases the singular behavior near the surface can be described by means of short - distance expansions or ( in simplified form ) by means of a phenomenological scaling analysis as presented above .",
    "it is interesting to point out , however , that in the presence of both spatial _ and _ temporal boundaries no additional singularities ( other than the ones discussed above ) occur @xcite , and , as a consequence , the _ short - time behavior in critical dynamics near surfaces _ is governed by exponents that can be expressed in terms of known surface and dynamic exponents@xcite .",
    "in this section we define the model and describe the results of the mf theory for general @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "they are the building blocks for the ( one - loop ) perturbative calculation of sec.[1loop ] . especially the zero - loop propagator for general @xmath1 and @xmath0 is not contained in explicit form in the literature so far . further in sec.[scatter ] we discuss the behavior of the real - space correlation function and the respective structure function that is measured for instance in x - ray scattering experiments .",
    "the one - loop calculation for this quantity for general @xmath1 and @xmath0 is not attempted in the present work .",
    "so the mf results presented here are not only the best presently available in the framework of continuum field theory , but also provide , as we think , a qualitative description of the results to be expected from scattering experiments .",
    "we consider the semi - infinite scalar @xmath2 with the hamiltonian@xcite @xmath156 + \\int_{\\partial v } \\left[\\frac12 c \\,\\phi^2+h_1\\,\\phi \\right]\\>,\\ ] ] where @xmath157 and @xmath158 stand for the volume of the semi - infinite system and its ( planar ) surface , respectively .",
    "the well - known solution to the op profile , minimizing the above hamiltonian , takes the form@xcite @xmath159 where the length scale @xmath160 is given by @xmath161 and @xmath162 the solution ( [ mmf ] ) satisfies the general ( mixed ) boundary condition @xmath163    the mf solution to the op profile has a fairly simple form .",
    "consistent with the discussion in secs.[intro ] and [ background ] , it is a monotonic function of @xmath32 .",
    "further , although @xmath1 and @xmath0 in principle give rise to two independent length scales , in the op profile they show up in a single length scale @xmath160 only . as a consequence ,",
    "the shape of the profile does not change qualitatively when one moves from one fixed point to the other .",
    "the two - point correlation function for general @xmath1 and @xmath0 that will be described next solves the equation @xmath164g({\\bf x } ,     { \\bf   x}')=\\delta({\\bf x}-{\\bf x}')\\>,\\ ] ] subject to the boundary condition ( at @xmath5 ) @xmath165g({\\bf x},{\\bf x}')|_{z=0}=0\\>,\\ ] ] where @xmath166 is the profile of ( [ mmf ] ) . to calculate @xmath116 we fourier transform with respect to the parallel , translationally invariant spatial directions .",
    "the result that can be obtained by standard methods reads @xmath167 where @xmath168 , @xmath169 is the heaviside step function , and the function @xmath170 and @xmath171 are given by @xmath172e^{-pz}\\ ] ] and @xmath173e^{-pz } \\right.\\nonumber\\\\[3 mm ]    & & \\hspace*{2.5 cm }   \\left.+   \\left[p^2-\\frac{3p}{z+z^+ } + \\frac{3}{(z+z^+)^2}\\right]e^{pz}\\right\\ }     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath174 further , we introduced a dimensionless wave vector @xmath175 and , for the sake of brevity , we defined @xmath176 the length scale @xmath160 was already introduced in ( [ z0 ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the op profile , the mf correlation function now depends on two length scales .",

    "analytic results for @xmath187 on the basis of ( [ prop ] ) can be obtained at or near the fixed points only , where the correlation function turns out to be much simpler than the general expression ( [ prop ] ) . here",

    "eventually , the crossover between special and ordinary transition was studied on the basis of the first - order perturbative approximation . in principle the results for general @xmath1 and @xmath0 presented in sec.[loop4 ] should cover this crossover as the limit @xmath330 .",
    "the qualitative scenario was described in sec.[crospord ] . in our first - order calculation",
    "we found that , while the asymptotics for small and large @xmath32 remain correct ( compare also ( [ sdp ] ) , the one - loop contribution becomes larger than the zero - loop term for intermediate @xmath32 , and the order - parameter profile becomes even negative for large @xmath1 ( see figs.6 and 7 ) .",
    "this means , in other words , that the first - order approximation breaks down in this limit , at least for intermediate distances , where the crossover from @xmath331 ( characteristic for the special transition ) to @xmath332 ( characteristic for the ordinary transition ) should occur .",
    "the reason for the failure of the first - order approximation is connected to different uv divergences at the ordinary and special transition , which , in the framework of the @xmath3-expansion , are intimately related to the short - distance singularities .",
    "this problem could probably be solved by introducing a cutoff , which , from the physical point of view , would certainly be meaningful , and consider the ordinary transition as the case where the surface enhancement @xmath1 is of the order of the cutoff ( as opposed to being of the order of the finite momentum scale @xmath231 in dimensional regularization ) .",

    "<S> we study the surface critical behavior of semi - infinite systems belonging to the bulk universality class of the ising model . </S>",

    "<S> starting from the field - theoretical @xmath2 model and employing renormalization - group improved perturbation theory ( @xmath3 expansion ) , explicit results for the local behavior of the correlation and structure function ( 0-loop ) and the order parameter ( 1-loop ) are derived . supplementing earlier studies that focussed on the special transition , we here pay particular attention to the situation where a large @xmath1 suppresses the tendency to order in the surface ( ordinary transition ) but a surface field @xmath0 generates a _ small _ surface magnetization @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> our results are in good agreement with recent phenomenological considerations and monte carlo studies devoted to similar questions and , combined with the latter , provide a much more detailed understanding of the local properties of systems with weak surface fields .    </S>",
