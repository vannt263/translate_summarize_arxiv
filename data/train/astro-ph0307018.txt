    "the existence of a dark energy term into cosmological dynamics has become a paradigm in the last five years since several observational campaigns give reliable indications on the apparent acceleration of the universe .",
    "+ high redshift supernovae surveys @xcite , cmbr data @xcite , sunyaev - zeldovich / x - ray methods @xcite and other approaches provide a new picture of the universe .",
    "it can be represented as an isotropic , homogeneous , spatially flat 4-dim manifold filled with about 30% of baryonic and non - baryonic matter and about 70% of dark energy , simply referred as  cosmological component \" .",
    "+ also the very recent wmap data @xcite confirm such a picture with extremely low uncertainties in the estimate of cosmological parameters .",
    "+ it is evident that the cosmological component should be the ingredient capable of generating the accelerated expansion , but , till now , its real nature is a puzzle which seems far to be solved . +",
    "many approaches has been developed .",
    "cosmological constant is the most straightforward candidate , however it is ruled out since its observational value ( constrained by observations ) differs of 120 order of magnitude from the theoretical prediction of qcd @xcite .",
    "this argument does not allow to interpret cosmological constant as the vacuum energy of gravitational field unless an evolutionary mechanism is invoked in order to explain dynamics starting from the huge early values of energy ( _ cosmological constant problem _ ) . besides , the observed comparable amounts ( in order of magnitude ) of matter and dark energy sets a strong fine - tuning problem which can not be overcome considering wide ranges of initial data ( _ coincidence problem _ ) @xcite .",
    "+ a second approach is to consider the cosmological component as a dynamical term .",
    "this scheme , usually called _ quintessence _ , can be achieved adding scalar fields into einstein gravity .",
    "such scalar fields are assumed rolling their interaction potential @xcite , as in the case of inflation but in a very different energetic regime ( today instead of early universe ) .",
    "however major shortcomings come out due , essentially , to the _ ad hoc _ forms of self - interaction potential .",
    "several forms of potential ( inverse power law , exponential , etc , @xcite ) achieve quintessence prescriptions ( e.g. accelerated behaviour , @xmath0 , coincidence problem , etc . ) but none of them seems to be directly related to some fundamental quantum field theory .",
    "the situation is , somehow , similar to that of inflationary cosmology : inflation is a good paradigm but no single model matches all requests .",
    "+ on the other hand , alternative approaches can be pursued starting from some fundamental theory @xcite .",
    "these schemes aim to improve the quintessence approach overcoming the problem of scalar field potential , generating a dynamical source for dark energy as an intrinsic feature",
    ". the goal would be to obtain a comprehensive model capable of linking the picture of early universe to the today observed one ; that is , a model derived from some effective theory of quantum gravity which , through an inflationary period results in the today accelerated friedmann expansion driven by some @xmath1-term .",
    "+ from this point of view , theories including torsion @xcite or higher order curvature invariants @xcite naturally come into the game . in fact , the former ones allow to include spin matter fields at a fundamental level in general relativity , while the latter ones come out in every quantization scheme of matter fields in curved space - time @xcite . specifically higher - order terms in curvature invariants as @xmath2 are inescapable if we want to obtain an effective action of gravity closed to the planck epoch .",
    "this scheme naturally give rise to inflationary behaviours @xcite .",
    "+ in @xcite , it is investigated the possibility that such terms could act also today as a non - clustered form of dark - energy , providing accelerated behaviours . besides",
    ", other authors have recently discussed curvature self - interactions of cosmic fluid to get cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper , we want better to detail such an approach .",
    "we provide exact solutions and , following the scheme in @xcite , we try to obtain observational constraints on the so called _ curvature quintessence _ in order to see if curvature contributions can actually match the data of recent surveys .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in sec.2 ,",
    "we summarize the curvature quintessence approach and derive a class of exact cosmological solutions .",
    "sect.3 is devoted to the matching with observational data .",
    "in particular , we fit our solutions against the snia data and derive the age of the universe .",
    "a further discussion is carried out in sec.4 considering the very recent wmap data , which seem to better constrain the parameters of cosmological solutions .",
    "sec.5 is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "a generic fourth  order theory of gravity , in four dimensions , is given by the action @xcite , @xmath3\\,{,}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is a function of ricci scalar @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the standard matter lagrangian density .",
    "we are using physical units @xmath7 .",

    "if @xmath12 , we recover the standard second  order gravity .",

    "+ it has to be stressed that the definition of @xmath5 in terms of @xmath15 introduces a constraint in the action ( [ 8 ] ) @xcite , by which we obtain by the lagrange multiplier technique the lagrangian @xmath16 + 6a\\dot{a}^2f'(r)+\\ ] ] @xmath17 ( the standard fluid matter contribution acts essentially as a pressure term @xcite ) .",

    "+ it is clear that the form of @xmath4 plays an essential role for this model .",
    "we choose the @xmath4 function as a generic power law of the scalar curvature and we ask for power law solutions of the scale factor .",
    "+ summarizing , we consider : @xmath27 the interesting cases are for @xmath28 which give rise to accelerated expansion .",
    "+ let us now concentrate now concentrate on the case with @xmath29 . inserting eqs.([22 ] ) into the above dynamical system , for a spatially flat space - time ( @xmath30 ) , we obtain an algebraic system for the parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32    @xmath33=0 \\\\",

    "the cases with generic @xmath32 and @xmath31 furnish an entire family of significative cosmological models . by the plot in fig.1",
    "we see that such a family of solutions admit negative and positive values of @xmath32 which give rise to accelerated behaviours .",
    "+      +    using eqs.([18 ] ) and ( [ 19 ] ) we can also deduce the state equation ( the barotropic index ) for the family of solution @xmath36 .",
    "we have @xmath37 which clearly is @xmath38 for @xmath39 .",
    "this fact shows that the approach is compatible with the recovering of a cosmological constant .",
    "+     against @xmath31 .",
    "we have drawn a line for the value @xmath40@xmath41 emphasizing the cosmological constant state equation value.,title=\"fig:\",width=453 ] +    eq.([29 ] ) is plotted in fig.2 . from the two plots , we can observe that the accelerated behaviour is allowed only for @xmath42 as requested for a cosmological fluid with negative pressure .",
    "+ the whole approach seems intriguing .",
    "in fact we are able to describe the accelerated phase of universe expansion simply as an effect of higher order curvature terms which provide an effective negative pressure contribute . in order to see",
    "if such behaviour is possible for today epoch we have to match our model with observational data .",
    "to verify if the curvature quintessence approach is an interesting perspective , we have to match the model with the observational data . in this way",
    ", we can constrain the parameters of the theory to significant values .",
    "first we compare our theoretical setting with the sneia results . as a further analysis",
    ", we check also the capability of our model in the universe age prediction .",
    "+ we have stressed in sec.1 that sneia observations have represented a cornerstone in the recent cosmology , pointing out that we live in an expanding accelerating universe .",
    "this result has been possible in relation to the feature of supernovae to be considered standard candles via the _",
    "phillips amplitude - luminosity relation_. + to test our cosmological model , we consider supernovae observations reported in @xcite @xcite .",
    "we have compiled a combined sample of 79 sneia discarding 6 likely outliers sneia as discussed in @xcite .",
    "+ starting from these data , it is possible to perform a comparison between the theoretical expression of the distance modulus    @xmath43    and its experimental value for sneia , @xmath44 is the redshift ( @xmath45 is the light speed , hereafter we will use standard units ) . in general , the luminosity distance @xmath46 can be expressed as :    @xmath47    where @xmath48 . from ( [ 22 ] ) , the hubble parameter is    @xmath49    where @xmath32 depends on @xmath31 as in eq.([28 ] ) .",
    "a fit by sneia data provides significant values of the parameter @xmath31 which assigns the curvature function .",
    "+ the best fit is performed as in @xcite minimizing the @xmath50 calculated between the theoretical and the observational value of distance modulus :    @xmath51 ^ 2 } { \\sigma _ { \\mu_{0},i}^{2 } + \\sigma_{mz , i}^{2 } } } \\label{33}\\ ] ]    for the above considered data @xcite .",
    "+ now , the luminosity distance becomes :    @xmath52     + which , after integration , gives    @xmath53.\\ ] ]    this expression is not defined for @xmath54 which physically correspond to static universes and milne ones ; such models are not interesting for our purposes .",
    "the range of @xmath31 can be divided into intervals taking into account the existence of singularities in ( [ 35 ] ) .",
    "thus , the fit is performed in five intervals of @xmath31 , which are : @xmath55 , + @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 . +",
    "in order to define a limit for @xmath59 , we have to note that the hubble parameter , as a function of @xmath31 , has the same trend of @xmath32 showed in fig.1 .",
    "we find that for @xmath31 lower than 100 , the trend is strictly increasing while for @xmath31 positive , greater than 100 , it is strictly decreasing . in relation to this feature ,",
    "we have tested the values of @xmath31 ranging in these limits because , as we shall see below , out of this range , the value of the age of universe becomes manifestly non - physically significant .",
    "the results of the fit are showed in table 1 . in fig.3 , we present the different contour plots for each evaluated range .",

    "first column indicates the range of @xmath31 , column two gives the relative best fit value of @xmath59 , column three @xmath60 , column four the @xmath61 index . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this paper we have analyzed a geometrical approach to quintessence given by considering a fourth - order theory of gravity and we have matched the cosmological models derived with observational data .",
    "this scheme , proposed as _ curvature quintessence _",
    "@xcite , represents an approach to describe an accelerated expanding universe dominated by a cosmological component without using scalar fields .",
    "+ we stress that such an approach has a natural background in several attempts of quantize gravity , because higher - order curvature invariants are generated to renormalize quantum field theories on curved space times @xcite .",
    "+ we have studied curvature quintessence neglecting matter as a first significative approximation .",
    "this approximation is possible if we consider that , at one loop level , matter and gravity have the same  weight \" in early universe @xcite and today the amount of cosmological and matter components , at cosmological density level , are comparable . in both regimes , the overall evolution can be assigned only by the cosmological component which gives a good approximation of dynamics .",
    "we ask for a power law functions for the action ( in terms of ricci curvature scalar ) and for the scale factor ( in terms of cosmological time ) . with these choices",
    ", we obtain a family of exact solutions so that the model is characterized by one parameter ( specifically @xmath31 ) . to check these solutions ,",
    "we have fitted the model with observational data .",
    "a straightforward test is a comparison with snia observations referring to the well known data of scp ( _ supernovae cosmology project _",
    "@xcite ) and of hzt ( _ high - z search team _",
    "+ the model fits these data and provides a constrain on the parameter @xmath31 .",
    "unfortunately this test is not decisive to feature curvature quintessence since the likelihood curves are degenerate with respect to @xmath31 .",
    "+ to improve this result , we have performed a test with the age of the universe . +",
    "in a first case , our test has been conceived considering , as good estimates for age of universe , values ranging between 10@xmath62 and 18 @xmath62 . considering that we take into account only accelerated dynamics , we deduced that for @xmath63 and @xmath64 curvature quintessence is a model capable of mimicking the actual universe . + in order to better refine these ranges , we have then considered a test based on wmap age evaluation .",
    "+ in this case , the age ranges between @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "this fact reduces the allowed intervals of the parameter @xmath31 , which are @xmath67 and @xmath68 . in conclusion",
    ", we can say that a fourth order theory of gravity of the form      with @xmath70 or @xmath71 can give rise to reliable cosmological models which well fit sneia and wmap data .",
    "+ in this sense , we need only  small \" corrections to second order einstein gravity action in order to achieve quintessence issues .",
    "+ indications in this sense can be found also in a detailed analysis of @xmath4 cosmological models performed against cmbr constraints , as shown in @xcite .",
