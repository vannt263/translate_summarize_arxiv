    "the cosmological observations from type ia supernovae @xcite , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and clusters of galaxies @xcite etc , all suggest that the expansion of the present universe is speeding up rather than slowing down .",
    "this at once indicates that the baryon matter component is about @xmath8 of the total energy density and about @xmath9 of the energy density in the universe is invisible which opposes the self attraction of matter and causes the observed expansion of the universe to accelerate .",
    "this acceleration is characterized by the negative pressure and the positive energy density and hence violates the strong energy condition .",
    "this violation gives a reverse gravitational effect . due to this effect",
    ", the universe gets a jerk and the transition from the earlier deceleration phase to the recent acceleration phase takes place @xcite .    in physical cosmology and astrophysics ,",
    "the simplest candidate for the dark energy ( de ) is the cosmological constant @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "however , it needs to be extremely fine - tuned to satisfy the current value of the de density , which is a serious problem @xcite .",
    "alternatively , to explain the decay of the density , the different forms of dynamically changing de with an effective equation of state ( eos ) , @xmath11 , were proposed instead of the constant vacuum energy density .",
    "there are several other possible forms of de such as quintessence @xmath12 @xcite , phantom @xmath13 @xcite etc .",
    "it is observed that current cosmological data from sn ia ( supernovae legacy survey , gold sample of hubble space telescope ) @xcite , cmbr ( wmap , boomerang ) @xcite and large scale structure ( sloan digital sky survey ) @xcite do not support possibility of @xmath14 .",
    "however , time - dependent de characterized by @xmath15 and crossing the phantom divide line even now is a favorable candidate .",
    "the limit obtained from observational results coming from cmbr anisotropy and galaxy clustering is @xmath16 with @xmath17 confidence level @xcite .    under the above circumstances , it is observed that in recent years bianchi universes have been gaining an increasing interest and tremendous impetus of observational cosmology . in connection to the wmap data @xcite it is now revealed that the standard cosmological model requires a positive and dynamic cosmological parameter that resembles the bianchi morphology @xcite . according to this ,",
    "the universe should achieve the following features : ( i ) a slightly anisotropic special geometry in spite of the inflation , and ( ii ) a nontrivial isotropization history of universe due to the presence of an anisotropic energy source .",
    "the anomalies found in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and large scale structure observations stimulated a growing interest in anisotropic cosmological model of universe . here",
    "we confine ourselves to model lrs bianchi - i whose spatial sections are flat but the expansion or contraction rate are direction dependent . for studying the possible effects of anisotropy in the early universe based on the present day observations many researchers",
    "@xcite have investigated bianchi type - i models from different point of view .",
    "we notice that , in connection to anisotropic equation of state for dark energy , several works are now available in the literature @xcite .",
    "some authors @xcite have studied anisotropic de models even with constant deceleration parameter ( dp ) .",
    "we would like to further mention that unlike the frw model this bianchi - i type model describes a different kind of universe in which the scale factor is not restricted to be the same in each direction . in the present work , following king and coles @xcite , we assume a large scale homogeneous magnetic field which is responsible for the anisotropy in the flat universe .",
    "it is expected that such a magnetic field will impose a single preferred direction in space .",
    "therefore , under the influence of this directional magnetic field along the field lines the anisotropy of the spacetime will be axisymmetric .",
    "however , it is argued by king and coles @xcite that the observed level of isotropy in the cmb places tight constraints upon the strength of any hubble scale magnetic field .",
    "the upper limit on such a field is found to be of the order of @xmath18 gauss @xcite .",
    "king and coles @xcite also state that these and other similar limits quote the adiabatically expanded , present - day equivalent very weak value of the field strength which equate to a much stronger field at very early times .",
    "it is a obvious question then - does the above size of the magnetic field satisfy all observational constraints at the different scales ?",
    "an extensive field survey provides that ( i ) the lowest measured intergalactic fields and close to the observational upper limits via faraday rotation measurements @xcite , may well be of cosmological origin ; ( ii ) a similar protogalactic field strength is inferred from the detection of fields of order @xmath19 gauss in high redshift galaxies @xcite and in damped lyman alpha clouds @xcite , ( iii ) primordial nucleosynthesis constraints only limit the equivalent current epoch field to be less than about @xmath20 gauss @xcite , a value that is only slightly stronger than the dynamical constraint at nucleosynthesis @xcite .    regarding the impact of magnetic field it is argued that in the early times , the magnetic field had the significant role on the dynamics of the universe depending on the direction of the field lines @xcite .",
    "several authors have used bianchi models to investigate the influence of the magnetic field on the evolution of the universe .",
    "it is worth noting that there has been some work on magnetic fields in bianchi i models in the past @xcite .",
    "milaneschi and fabbri @xcite studied the anisotropy and polarization of cmb radiation where as , jacobs @xcite explored the effect of a uniform primordial magnetic field . both the investigating groups used bianchi - i model of the universe .",
    "jacobs @xcite argued that in the early stages of the evolution of the universe , the magnetic field produced large expansion anisotropies during the radiation - dominated phase whereas it has negligible effect during the dust - dominated phase .    in the relatively recent works",
    ", it is seen that king and coles @xcite have used the magnetized perfect fluid energy - momentum tensor to discuss the effects of magnetic field on the evolution of universe .",
    "sharif and zubair @xcite have studied dynamics of bianchi - i universe with magnetized field of anisotropic dark energy .    in the present work , however , we present a magnetized dark energy model with time varying dp in lrs  bianchi - i spacetime .",
    "the investigation is organized as follows : the metric and field equations are presented in section 2 .",
    "section 3 deals with the exact solutions of field equations and physical behavior of the model .",
    "the comparison between distance modulus @xmath21 of derived model and observational @xmath22 is presented in section 4 respectively .",
    "finally the results are discussed in section 5 .",
    "we consider the lrs bianchi type i metric of the form @xmath23 where , a and b are functions of @xmath24 only . in the limit where @xmath25 , the metric equation ( [ eq1 ] ) reduces to flat frw metric . here",
    "the geometry of space - time ( 1 ) is represented by two equivalent transverse directions @xmath26 and @xmath27 and one different longitudinal direction @xmath28 , along which the magnetic field is oriented i. e. @xmath29 only .",

    "the electromagnetic field tensor @xmath39 has only one non - vanishing component , viz .",
    ", @xmath40 constant .",
    "therefore , for the electromagnetic field tensor @xmath41 , one gets the following non - trivial components , @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , the einstein s field equations ( [ eq2 ] ) for the line - element ( [ eq1 ] ) reduce to the following system of equations @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 here , and in what follows , over - dots indicates differentiation with respect to @xmath24 .",
    "the energy conservation equations @xmath46 , related to the two equations for cosmic fluid and magnetic field @xcite , are as follows @xmath47 @xmath48 here @xmath49 is positive constant and @xmath50 is the mean hubble parameter , which for lrs bianchi - i space - time can be defined as @xmath51 with @xmath52 being the average scale factor of lrs bianchi type - i model and can be expressed as @xmath53    it seems that any radiation field with the evolution law expressed in eq .",
    "( 8) would work .",
    "however , one may raise a tricky question that why does this field only scale with the scale factor @xmath6 ?",
    "it can be verified that if one writes the conservation equation for cosmic fluid and the magnetic field separately , then one can get eq .",

    "the observations of the velocity - redshift relation for extragalactic sources suggest that hubble expansion of the universe is isotropic today within approximately @xmath64 percent or to put more precisely , redshift studies place the limit @xmath65 on the ratio of shear ( @xmath56 ) to hubble constant ( @xmath50 ) in the neighborhood of our galaxy today @xcite . in this connection it is also to be mentioned that collins et al . @xcite",

    "in this paper , we have investigated magnetized de model under the assumption that @xmath140 in bianchi - i spacetime . under some specific choice of the parameters the present consideration",
    "yields the time dependent dp and eos parameters .",
    "it is to be noted that our procedure of solving the field equations are altogether different from what sharif and zubair @xcite have adopted .",
    "the derived model starts expanding with big bang singularity at @xmath141 and this singularity is point type because the directional scale factors @xmath5 and @xmath6 both simultaneously vanish at @xmath141 .",
    "the dynamics of dp parameter yields two different phases of the universe .",
    "initially dp is evolving with positive sign that yields the decelerating phase of the universe whereas in the later times it is evolving with negative sign which describes the present phase of the acceleration of the universe .",
    "thus the derived model has transition of the universe from the early deceleration phase to the later acceleration phase which is in good agreement with the recent observations @xcite .",
    "the distance modulus of the derived model fit well with the observational @xmath22 values ( see fig . 4 and table 1 ) which in turn imply that the derived model is physically realistic .",
    "it is important to note here that in the absence of the magnetic field only the anisotropic distribution of de leads the present acceleration of the universe @xcite while in the presence of magnetic field along with the isotropic distribution of de describes the dynamics of the universe from big bang to the present epoch .",
    "thus the magnetic field isotropizes the distribution of de which signifies the role of magnetic field . hence from the theoretical perspective",
    ", the present model can be a viable model to explain the late time acceleration of the universe .",
    "in other words , the solution presented here can be one of the potential candidates to describe the observed universe .",
    "it is worth noticing that we have presented solutions of a magnetized bianchi - i universe like king and coles @xcite .",
    "however , their work is concerned with vacuum energy . in our case",
    ", we have studied the universe consists of cosmic fluid with equation of state @xmath142 .",
    "therefore , our study is more general than king and coles @xcite .    in the present work we observe an interesting feature that the magnetic presence isotropises the expansion in the model",
    "however , it is not clear , in particular , what property of the magnetic field is responsible for the isotropisation .",
    "is it the additional energy density of the field , is it the magnetic pressure , or maybe the tension ? it can be observed that the solution of eq .",

    "therefore , in the derived model , one can not choose @xmath82 . to obtain an explicit solution of eq .",
    "( 16 ) , one can choose @xmath143 which leads to @xmath144 and the isotropic distribution of cosmic fluid .",
    "this can also be observed from the lhs s of eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) , which are same for @xmath82 . as a result",
    ", one should get @xmath144 .",
    "this means , there is no contribution of magnetic field and the model becomes an isotropic frw model .",
    "the well known criteria for isotropization are @xmath145 and @xmath146 , where @xmath5 , @xmath147 are average anisotropy and shear respectively , and @xmath148 is the directional hubble parameter",
    ". obviously , these criteria are valid for large physical time . in the present model ( eqs .",
    "( 21 ) - ( 24 ) ) , one can easily find out that for large time , @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "this immediately implies that for @xmath151 our model turns out to be an isotropic frw model .",
    "therefore , @xmath152 is the condition of isotropy in the absence of magnetic field and the presence of magnetic field has constraint on @xmath82 .",
    "this seems to contribute the magnetic field which resembles with the initial anisotropy of the universe . with the passage of time magnetic",
    "field decreases and becomes negligible at late time to approach towards isotropy .",
    "our solution , in the present investigation , shows that the constrained equation of state of @xmath34 evolves in time , but this is not all that is needed when comparing with observations .",
    "this explicitly means that it is not exactly known about the generic fluid @xmath34 , and how does it describe and include the known cosmological history where an early radiation domination gave way to matter domination .",
    "in particular , fitting the @xmath153 evolution law derived from sn observations is only one of the many pieces of information which need to be used .",
    "a thorough discussion of all basic cosmological constraints is beyond the scope of this analysis in the present paper and is awaiting for a future project .",
