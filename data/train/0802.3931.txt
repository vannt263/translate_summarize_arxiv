    "solar active regions are the sites of occurrence of most solar flares",
    ". large active regions may persist for several solar rotations , and produce dozens of significant flares during a transit of the disk @xcite .",
    "the largest flares are believed to involve the release of more than @xmath0 of stored magnetic energy , the energy appearing in accelerated particles , heating , bulk motion of material , and radiation @xcite .",
    "the process underlying flares is accepted to be magnetic reconnection , although the details of the process remain the subject of study @xcite .",
    "the dynamical energy balance of solar active regions presents challenges to our understanding .",
    "the energy liberated in flares is thought to be excess or ` free ' magnetic energy associated with electric current systems in the solar atmosphere , but the origin of the currents , and hence the source of the energy , is not well understood @xcite .",
    "two popular pictures for energy supply are first that existing coronal magnetic structures are twisted and sheared by photospheric motions , producing currents , and second that new current - carrying magnetic flux emerges through the photosphere .",
    "these mechanisms suggest that energy supply to an active region may be described as a continuous process , driven by slow photospheric and sub - photospheric motions .",
    "in contrast , flare energy release is rapid and unexpected .",
    "an important point is that the size of the downwards jump in energy associated with a flare may be very large , by comparison with the amount of stored active region energy .",
    "the understanding of active region energy balance is hampered by the inability to calculate coronal magnetic energy . in principle",
    "the magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) virial theorem permits the calculation of magnetic energy from vector field values inferred in the chromosphere subject to the assumption that the field is everywhere force free ( e.g.  metcalf et al .",
    "however few chromospheric vector field determinations are made , and the reliability of the method is unknown .",
    "methods for modeling coronal magnetic fields from photospheric or chromospheric boundary conditions are being developed @xcite , and these may permit estimation of coronal magnetic energy",
    ". there has also been recent progress in methods for estimating the rate of supply of energy to an active region directly from observations ( e.g.  welsch et al .",
    "for example , in ideal mhd the poynting flux is @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the fluid velocity and @xmath3 is the magnetic field , and in principle this quantity may be estimated at the photosphere from observations .",
    "although we lack detailed quantitative information about the rate of energy supply to , and the energy stored in , active regions , we do have detailed information about solar flare occurrence .",
    "the energy released in flares may be estimated ( albeit subject to some error ) , and the rate of occurrence of flares is observed .",
    "two related statistical properties of flares  the frequency - energy distribution , and the distribution of times between events  have been studied in some detail , as summarized below .",
    "studies of the frequency - energy distribution show that it is a power law over many decades in energy @xcite .",
    "specifically the distribution may be written @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the number of flares per unit time and per unit energy @xmath6 , the factor @xmath7 is a ( time - dependent ) measure of the total flaring rate , and @xmath8 . typically this distribution is determined for flares from all active regions on the sun over some period of time , but it also appears to apply to individual active regions @xcite , which suggests that the power law is intrinsic to the flare mechanism . a popular model explaining the power law is the avalanche model @xcite , in which the magnetic field in the corona is assumed to be in a self - organized critical state , and subject to avalanches of small - scale reconnection events .",
    "there has been considerable interest in the flare waiting - time distribution , and more generally in waiting - time distributions for what they reveal about underlying physics in a variety of systems @xcite .",
    "determinations of flare waiting - time distributions have given varied results @xcite .",
    "the results suggest that the observed distribution depends on the particular active region and on time , and that it is also influenced by event definition and selection procedures @xcite . for some active regions",
    ", the distribution appears to be consistent with a simple poisson process , i.e.  independent events occurring at a constant mean rate @xcite .",
    "the corresponding waiting - time distribution is exponential .",
    "other active regions show time - variation in the flaring process , and flare occurrence may be approximated by a piecewise constant , or more generally time - varying poisson process @xcite .",
    "on longer time scales a power - law tail is observed for events from the whole sun @xcite .",
    "this may be accounted for in terms of a time - dependent poisson model @xcite , although some authors have argued that the power law has fundamental significance @xcite .",
    "we note that the waiting - time distribution has often been considered in isolation from other flare statistics , in particular the frequency - energy distribution .    to understand the statistics of flare occurrence , it is desirable to have a general theory for the energetics of an active region , relating the free energy of the active region to the observed frequency - energy and waiting - time distributions .",
    "@xcite presented the first model of this kind , which was analogous to fermi acceleration . in this model active regions experience exponential growth in free energy between flares which occur as a poisson process in time , depleting all accumulated energy .",
    "this gives a power - law flare frequency - energy distribution for large energies , and presupposes poisson occurrence .",
    "litvinenko ( 1994 ; 1996 ) generalized the model to incorporate different rates of supply of energy to the system , but the litvinenko models retained the feature that each flare releases all of the free energy .",
    "this aspect of the @xcite model was criticized by @xcite .",
    "@xcite introduced a model permitting arbitrary changes in free energy at each flare .",
    "the model assumes the free energy @xmath6 of an active region increases secularly between jump transitions downward in energy ( flares ) , which occur at a rate @xmath9 for jumps from @xmath6 to @xmath10 , per unit energy .",
    "a master equation describes the steady - state energy balance , and the solution of this equation is the probability distribution @xmath11 for the free energy .",
    "the flare frequency - energy distribution is given by the convolution @xmath12 @xcite investigated solutions to the master equation for constant energy input and for a choice of transition rates @xmath13 , which leads to power - law behavior @xmath14 ( below a high energy rollover set by the highest energy an active region is likely to have ) .",
    "@xcite did not determine a waiting - time distribution for the model .",
    "it was argued that the derived power - law solutions are consistent with an avalanche - type model , and avalanche models have simple poisson waiting - time statistics @xcite . however",
    ", this presents a puzzle : the total rate of flaring in the @xcite model is given by @xmath15 which depends on the energy of the system .",
    "hence it is expected that the occurrence of flares is not strictly poisson , since the occurrence of a flare changes the energy of the system , and hence the instantaneous total rate of flaring .",
    "non - poisson waiting - time statistics might then be expected .",
    "recently @xcite demonstrated how to determine steady - state waiting - time distributions for continuous time processes with arbitrary jump transitions .",
    "the @xcite theory is quite general , applying to any system described by a single time - dependent stochastic variable @xmath16 following a deterministic trajectory interrupted by positive or negative jumps of random timing and size .",
    "the probability distribution @xmath17 for @xmath16 is described by a master equation , and the waiting - time distribution for jumps in the steady state may be obtained from the solution to the steady - state master equation .",
    "@xcite demonstrated the theory in application to simple models for human attention , for voltage across a nerve membrane , and for soil moisture content associated with rainfall events . in each case",
    "the models were analytic , involving simple solutions to the master equation . in this paper",
    "the @xcite theory is applied to the @xcite model for active region free energy , and waiting - time distributions are derived for solutions of relevance to flares .",
    "the application of the theory is relatively straightforward : the wheatland & glukhov ( 1998 ) model is in the class of models considered by @xcite , the time - dependent stochastic variable being the active region energy @xmath18 .",
    "minor modifications to the theory are required because @xmath6 is a positive definite quantity , and because the jump transitions in @xmath6 are always negative .",
    "a specific difficulty in applying the theory is that for the power - law form for rate transitions relevant for flares , the master equation is not amenable to analytic solution . in this paper",
    "an efficient numerical method of solution of the steady state master equation is presented and applied .",
    "this paper also considers a more general form for flare transition rates than considered in @xcite .",
    "the results resolve the puzzle outlined above concerning whether the model produces an exponential waiting - time distribution .",
    "the sections of the paper are as follows .",
    "section  [ model ] presents the model , starting with the time - dependent master equation (  [ master ] ) .",
    "section  [ wtd ] shows how steady - state waiting - time distribution may be obtained ,  [ analytic_solns ] presents simple analytic solutions illustrating the theory , and  [ moments ] considers the information provided by moments of the master equation .",

    "an active region is modeled as a system with free energy @xmath18 which evolves in time due to secular energy input and jumps downward in energy at random times and of random sizes .",
    "the system is described by the time - dependent master equation @xcite for the probability distribution @xmath19 of the free energy : @xmath20 -\\lambda ( e)p(e , t ) \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\int_e^{\\infty}p(e^{\\prime},t)\\alpha ( e^{\\prime},e)de^{\\prime } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 describes the energy input rate at time @xmath22 , @xmath9 describes the rate of flare jumps from @xmath6 to @xmath10 , and @xmath23 is the total rate of flaring , given by equation  ( [ eq : lambda ] ) .",
    "the terms on the right hand side of equation  ( [ eq : master ] ) describe the system gradually increasing in energy due to energy input , falling to a lower energy due to a flare , and falling from a higher energy due to a flare , respectively .",
    "this is the time - dependent version of the master equation given in @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we note that the system is also described by the stochastic differential equation @xmath24 where @xmath25 describes accumulated losses in energy due to flaring , @xmath26 is the delta function , and where the times @xmath27 are given by a state - dependent poisson process with occurrence rate @xmath28 $ ] . the jump amplitudes @xmath29 are distributed according to the ( state - dependent ) distribution @xmath30 , defined by @xmath31 so that @xmath32 .",
    "@xcite showed how  assuming a steady state  the waiting - time distribution for the jump transitions may be derived . in this section",
    "we briefly re - iterate the theory , as it applies to the present model .",

    "the distribution @xmath35 of final energies @xmath34 is given by the rate of jumping at a given energy divided by the mean total rate of jumping , i.e.   @xmath36 where @xmath11 is the steady - state solution to the master equation  ( [ eq : master ] ) and @xmath37 is the mean total rate .",
    "the distribution @xmath38 of starting energies @xmath33 is then given by @xmath39 together with the distribution of jumps @xmath40 : @xmath41 which using equations  ( [ eq : h ] ) and  ( [ eq : pee ] ) may be rewritten as @xmath42 the waiting - time distribution is given by @xmath43 with @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the solution to @xmath46   -\\lambda ( e)p_{\\lambda}(e , t)\\ ] ] with the initial condition @xmath47 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : pde_plambda ] ) describes the evolution of the system before a flaring jump occurs , i.e.  over the deterministic trajectory starting at energy @xmath33 and ending at energy @xmath34 .",

    "the examples are not relevant for flares , because they do not produce power - law frequency - energy distributions , but they show how poisson and non - poisson waiting - time distributions may be obtained .",
    "the case @xmath48 and @xmath55 ( where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are constants ) was considered by @xcite . in this case equation  ( [ eq : lambda ] )",
    "gives @xmath58 , so the total rate of jumps is energy dependent and the waiting - time distribution will not correspond to a simple poisson process .",
    "the analytic solution to the steady - state master equation is @xmath59 with @xmath60 , and from equation  ( [ eq : ffe ] ) the frequency - energy distribution for jumps is a gaussian : @xmath61 from equation  ( [ eq : lambda_bar ] ) the mean total rate is @xmath62 , and using equations  ( [ eq : pee ] ) and  ( [ eq : pse2 ] ) the distributions of end- and start - energies for deterministic trajectories are @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively . using equations  ( [ eq : ptau_beta0 ] ) and  ( [ eq : pee_gauss ] ) it follows that the waiting - time distribution is also a gaussian : @xmath65    as a second example , we consider the case @xmath48 and @xmath66 ( where @xmath57 and @xmath67 are constants ) . since the total rate is constant the waiting - time distribution must be @xmath68 i.e.  jumps occur in time as a simple poisson process . from equation  ( [ eq : lambda ] )",
    "this case requires @xmath69 .",

    "equation  ( [ eq : first ] ) requires @xmath77 to go to zero as @xmath78 and @xmath79 . in the steady state equation  ( [ eq : first ] ) gives @xmath85",
    "in the following we consider solutions to the steady - state master equation which may be of relevance to solar flares .      we restrict attention to the case @xmath48 , a constant .",
    "the motivation is that active regions are externally driven , i.e.  the energy is supplied from the sub - photosphere by external processes . in the absence of a back reaction , it is then expected that the energy supply rate does not depend on the state of the system . in passing we",
    "note that in general the energy supply rate may depend on time .",
    "however , in this section we consider only steady - state solutions to the master equation .",
    "we return to this point in  4 .",
    "we consider the form @xmath86 for the flare transition rate , where @xmath87 is a low - energy cutoff , and @xmath88 is the step function .",
    "the case @xmath89 was considered in @xcite .",
    "the motivation for equation  ( [ eq : pl_alpha ] ) is that it may describe an avalanche - type system , in which energy transitions are intrinsically power - law distributed .",
    "the power law is assumed to originate in the microphysics of the flare process , and must be assumed at the level of this model .",
    "[ this is in contrast to models which attempt to account for the power law , e.g.  @xcite . ]",

    "it is plausible that an avalanche - type system with more energy is more likely to contain unstable sites , and hence will flare at a higher rate . in the following we take @xmath91 in every instance , and consider two cases : @xmath89 , following @xcite ; and @xmath92 .",
    "the choice of transition rates  ( [ eq : pl_alpha ] ) leads to the total flaring rate @xmath93 hence the rate of occurrence of flares is energy - dependent , and the waiting - time distribution will not correspond to a simple poisson process , as pointed out in  1 .",
    "application of the first moment with the choice of transition rates  ( [ eq : pl_alpha ] ) leads to a simple estimate for the mean energy of the system @xcite .",
    "specifically , from equation  ( [ eq : r(e ) ] ) we have @xmath94 for @xmath95 .",

    "the lower bound is shown in the upper and middle panels by a vertical line .",

    "the lower panel shows the waiting - time distribution @xmath114 ( solid curve ) as well as the poisson distribution @xmath115 ( dotted line ) corresponding to the mean rate of flaring implied by the form of @xmath23 and the solution for @xmath11 [ see equation  ( [ eq : lambda_bar ] ) ] .",
    "note that the units for time in the lower panel are @xmath116 , following the non - dimensionalization in  [ numerical ] .",
    "the waiting - time distribution for the model is approximately poisson , although there is a slight deficiency of long waiting - times by comparison with the poisson distribution .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the case @xmath89 and @xmath117 , which is the other case considered by @xcite , in the same format as figure  [ fig1 ] . for a lower value of @xmath118",
    "the system flares less often and hence is more likely to have larger energy . hence the distribution @xmath11 shown in the upper panel",

    "the flare frequency - energy distribution ( middle panel ) is a power law over more decades in energy than for the case @xmath119 .",
    "these results are consistent with the findings of @xcite .",

    "the results in figures  [ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] suggest that the @xmath89 model has a waiting - time distribution which is close to being strictly poisson ( exponential ) , and that the approximation becomes better for smaller values of @xmath56 .",
    "this may be understood in terms of the expression  ( [ eq : lambda_pl_alpha ] ) .",
    "for @xmath95 the total rate is @xmath121 , which is constant , in which case a poisson waiting - time distribution is expected . for smaller values of @xmath56",

    "figure  [ fig3 ] illustrates this explanation for the case @xmath89 , @xmath117 .",
    "the solid curve shows the total rate as a function of energy , and the dashed line shows the mean total rate @xmath122 . the energy distribution @xmath11 is shown , with arbitrary normalization , by the dotted curve .",

    "[ intro ] : the waiting - time distribution for the model is not strictly poisson , but is a good approximation to an exponential .",
    "next we consider the case @xmath92 , to examine what happens when the rate of flare transitions increases with the energy of the system .",
    "figures  [ fig4 ] and  [ fig5 ] show the cases @xmath123 and @xmath124 respectively , in the same format as figures  1 and  2 .",
    "first consider figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "the energy distribution @xmath11 shown in the upper panel is qualitatively similar to the @xmath89 case , although the distribution declines more rapidly at higher energies , so that it is more skewed in a linear - log representation . since the rate of transitions increases with energy , the system is less likely to be found at very large energies , and this explains the rapid decline .",
    "the middle panel shows the flare frequency - energy distribution @xmath5 , which is a power law with index @xmath101 below a high energy rollover .",
    "the estimate  ( [ eq : ebar_pl_alpha ] ) for the mean of the distribution ( vertical line ) provides a lower bound for the departure from power law behavior .",
    "the lower panel shows the waiting - time distribution @xmath114 , and the poisson distribution implied by @xmath122 .",
    "the waiting - time distribution is approximately poisson , but has a deficit of long waiting times .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] illustrates the case with reduced flare transition rates . the distribution @xmath11 ( upper panel )",
    "is shifted to higher energies , and is again quite skewed in the linear - log representation .",
    "the frequency - energy distribution @xmath5 ( middle panel ) is a power law over more decades in energy .",
    "the waiting - time distribution @xmath113 ( lower panel ) is again approximately exponential , but departs somewhat from the poisson model , including showing an excess of long waiting times .",
    "the results in the lower panels of figures  [ fig4 ] and  [ fig5 ] suggest that , for the @xmath92 model , the waiting - time distribution is approximately exponential but shows some departure from the poisson case depending on the parameters of the model .",
    "the approximate poisson behavior is perhaps surprising because in this case the total rate of flaring [ given by equation  ( [ eq : lambda_pl_alpha ] ) ] varies approximately linearly with @xmath6 ( for @xmath95 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] illustrates this for the case @xmath92 , @xmath124 , using the same format as figure  [ fig3 ] . the total rate ( solid curve )",
    "increases substantially over the range of energies the system is likely to have [ the dotted curve shows @xmath11 ] , and may be substantially different to @xmath122 ( the dashed line ) .",
    "however , @xmath114 is defined by a complicated average of the rate over energy , which is different for different waiting times [ see equation  ( [ eq : ptau_beta0 ] ) ] , and the numerical results show that the resulting waiting - time distribution is approximately poisson .",
    "a stochastic model is presented for the free magnetic energy of a flaring solar active region .",
    "the energy of an active region is assumed to grow deterministically between random flare events at which the energy jumps downwards by an amount equal to the flare energy .",
    "flares jumps occur from energy @xmath6 to @xmath10 with a rate @xmath9 per unit time and per unit energy , and energy input occurs at a rate @xmath126 .",
    "active region energy is then described by a distribution @xmath11 which is the steady state solution to a master equation .",
    "this distribution determines two observable distributions , namely the flare frequency - energy distribution , and the waiting - time distribution .",
    "the model generalizes and extends the approach of @xcite .",
    "novel aspects of the work presented here include the determination of waiting - time distributions [ following general theory presented by @xcite ] , consideration of a more general form for the rate of flare transitions , and introduction of an efficient method of numerical solution of the steady - state master equation .",
    "the form @xmath127 for flare transitions is investigated , for the cases @xmath89 and @xmath128 .",
    "the case @xmath129 was considered by @xcite , motivated by the avalanche model . for both cases",
    "the model is shown to produce power - law flare frequency - energy distributions below a rollover at high energies , due to the active region having a finite energy .",
    "for both cases the waiting - time distribution is approximately exponential ( poisson ) . for the case",
    "@xmath111 this may be understood in that the total rate @xmath23 is approximately constant for @xmath95 , which becomes a good approximation for small @xmath56 , when the system is more likely to be found at large energies .",
    "this result is consistent with the interpretation of this model as avalanche - like , since avalanche models have simple poisson statistics . for the case",
    "@xmath128 the interpretation is more complicated , because the total rate varies approximately linearly with energy .",
    "however , the waiting - time distribution is determined by an average of rates over the possible energies of the active region , and numerical evaluation shows that the result is approximately exponential .",
    "the general model introduced in  [ master ] includes time dependence in the driving rate , but we have focused on the steady state throughout this paper .",
    "many active regions exhibit large variations in the rate of flaring during a transit of the disk @xcite .",
    "this behavior is often linked e.g.  with the emergence of new magnetic flux @xcite , which suggest that it is a response to an increased rate of driving .",
    "hence we have neglected an important aspect of active region energetics .",
    "time - dependent driving will influence the observed waiting - time distribution . in the simplest case time variation might be represented by a piecewise constant variation in the driving rate .",
    "if the system adjusts suitably quickly to changes in driving , the steady state solution applies to each piece .",
    "the waiting - time distribution is then a weighted sum over the steady - state distributions applying to each piece @xcite .",
    "based on the results presented in this paper , the waiting - time distribution for active regions is expected to be approximately exponential provided the rate of driving of the system is constant . if the rate of driving is time varying , the distribution will depart from exponential . a time - dependent model will be investigated in future work .",
    "one shortcoming of the model is that it does not describe energy loss from the system by mechanisms other than flaring , for example loss due to flux submergence , or quasi - steady background dissipation .",
    "however , a simple generalization of the master equation permits this .",
    "specifically , if the secular energy ` input ' is replaced by small jumps in energy ( which may be positive or negative ) , then the energy gains and losses may be represented by fokker - planck terms in a generalized master or chapman - kolmogorov equation .",
    "specifically , the secular energy increase term @xmath130/\\partial e$ ] on the right hand side of equation  ( [ eq : master ] ) may be replaced by a pair of terms @xmath131/\\partial e + \\frac{1}{2}\\partial^2\\left[\\beta_2 ( e , t ) p(e , t)\\right]/\\partial e^2 $ ] , where the coefficients @xmath132 , @xmath133 represent first and second moments of energy changes associated with the small jump transitions @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to solve the resulting generalize master equation by discretization and solution of the resulting linear system , extending the approach presented in the appendix .",
    "however , in this case the @xcite method for determining the steady - state waiting - time distribution needs to be modified .",
    "this model will be investigated more completely in future work .",
    "the results presented here show how it is possible to construct a model for active region energetics which directly predicts observable flare statistics , namely the flare frequency - energy , and waiting - time distributions . in principle",
    "the observations may be used to determine the energy supply and flare energy release terms in the model , i.e.   @xmath21 and @xmath9 . however , the observations are not really precise or unambiguous enough to identify these terms with certainty .",
    "in particular , the interpretation of the waiting - time distribution is complicated by the time dependence of the energy supply .",
    "the situation would be improved by an ability to estimate coronal free energy and the rate of supply of energy to active regions from observations .",
    "reliable methods for estimating these quantities are the subject of current research @xcite .",
    "if such methods are developed , the theory developed here will be of greater significance .",
    "it may provide valuable insight into the flare mechanism , as well as being of practical benefit for flare prediction .",
    "the author thanks ian craig for pointing out that the master equation can be solved as a linear system by back - substitution , and a referee for helpful comments which improved the presentation .",
    "discretizing equation  ( [ eq : steady_master_ndim ] ) at energies @xmath134 gives @xmath135 where @xmath136 and where @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "centered differencing is used for the derivative , and the extended trapezoidal rule is used for the integrals .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : master_discrete ] ) with @xmath139 ( and the assumption @xmath140 ) may be supplemented by the normalization condition @xmath141 to give @xmath142 linear equations in the @xmath142 unknowns @xmath143 .",
    "the resulting linear system may be solved efficiently by back - substitution as follows .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : master_discrete ] ) may be re - written @xmath144,\\ ] ] which expresses @xmath145 in terms of @xmath146 .",
    "hence if we assume a value for @xmath147 , we can apply equation  ( [ eq : master_discrete2 ] ) to solve for @xmath148 , and then apply it again to solve for @xmath149 , etc . in this way we can determine @xmath150 up to an unknown normalization factor .",
    "the factor is determined by applying equation  ( [ eq : norm_discrete ] ) .",
