    "over the past two decades , high - resolution observations with the _ hubble space telescope _ have shown that massive stellar clusters reside at the photometric and dynamical centers of most intermediate and low luminosity galaxies of all hubble types  @xcite . with sizes in the range @xmath1 to @xmath2pc and masses in the range @xmath3 to @xmath4 , these nuclear clusters ( ncs )",
    "have central densities up to @xmath5 , making them the densest stellar systems observed  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "nscs are observed to be larger and brighter , and to follow different structural scaling relations than globular clusters .",
    "the nsc  half light radii scale with their total mass roughly as @xmath6 , while globular clusters have @xmath7 irrespective of their luminosity , albeit with a large scatter  @xcite .",
    "however , the nsc  mass distribution overlaps with that of globular clusters at its low mass end , suggesting a possible connection between the two types of stellar clusters  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "nscs have been studied in detail for large samples of galaxies in different environments .",
    "observational work has revealed that the nucleation fraction of galaxies is similar for galaxies belonging to very different environments , including the virgo , fornax , and coma clusters as well as galaxies in the field  @xcite . on average @xmath8 of all galaxies of all hubble types with magnitude in the range @xmath9",
    "contain a well defined central cluster .",
    "hence nscs appear to be ubiquitous structures in galaxies although they tend to be missing in galaxies brighter than magnitude @xmath10 and fainter than @xmath11  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the real nucleated fraction could be however larger than the value constrained from observations given that the morphological complexity and high surface brightness often characterizing the center of galaxies can make nscs difficult to identify , especially in massive spheroids .",
    "high resolution spectroscopic surveys have been used to place constraints on nsc ages and star formation histories  @xcite .",
    "the common finding emerging from these studies is that nscs are characterized by a complex star formation history with a mixture of morphological components and different stellar populations spanning a wide range of characteristic ages from @xmath2myr to @xmath2gyr .",
    "cluster ages and masses are also found to depend on the host galaxy hubble type , with nscs in early - type spirals being older and more massive than those of late - type spirals .",
    "the luminosity - weighted ages of nscs are typically smaller than the ages of host galactic disks , indicating that the growth of the nuclei is a continuous and ongoing process occurring during and after most of the host galaxy was formed  @xcite .",
    "age estimates for most nscs remain however susceptible to large uncertainties due to the fact that the light is often dominated by young stellar populations while at the same time the mass is dominated by the old stars .",
    "the inability to infer spectroscopically the age of old cluster components can introduce a bias toward younger ages .",
    "the bulk of the stellar population is typically found in an older and spatially more extended stellar component  @xcite .",
    "this appears to be the case for the milky way in which more than @xmath12 of the stars inside the inner parsec formed more than @xmath13 ago , while luminous massive stars dominate the central cluster light within @xmath14pc  @xcite .",
    "nsc  old and young stellar populations also differ morphologically .",
    "@xcite showed that the three edge - on late - type galaxies ic 5052 , ngc 4206 , and ngc 4244 have nuclei that are strongly flattened along the plane of their host galaxy disks . such nscs show evidence for young stellar components distributed onto a disk - like or ring structure superimposed on an older more spherical component . in the edge - on spiral galaxy ngc 4244 , old and young stellar components both show clear signs of rotation  @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that the presence of such multiple rotating morphological components and the presence of a flattened young cluster aligned with the major axis of the host galaxy point toward an in situ build up of nuclear clusters , whereby stars form episodically in compact nuclear disks and then lose angular momentum or heat vertically to form an older spheroidal structure .",
    "it has been noted however that both rotation and the presence of young structural components does not exclude other formation mechanisms such as for example episodic accretion of young star clusters in the central part of the galaxy due to dynamical friction  @xcite . in the case of ngc 4244 for example",
    ", it is likely that accreation of star clusters has contributed at least in part to the growth of its nsc  @xcite .",
    "since the early studies , it has been realized that nsc  masses correlate fairly well with galaxy properties such as bulge velocity dispersion , bulge and galaxy total luminosity  @xcite .",
    "the existence of such correlations suggests that the formation of nscs is intimately connected to the formation and evolution of the host galaxy  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "given that nscs and mbhs are found to coexist in some galaxies , that in these systems they have comparable masses , and that both follow tight correlations with galaxy properties , it is also natural to ask whether nscs and mbhs are somehow connected to each other .",
    "nscs and mbhs are known to co - exist in galaxies with masses @xmath15  @xcite ; galaxies with masses lower than this value show clear evidence for nucleation but little evidence for a mbh .",
    "conversely galaxies with masses above @xmath16 are dominated by mbhs but show no evidence for nucleation  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite found that the nuclei and mbhs obey a similar scaling relation linking their mass to the virial mass of the host galaxy .",
    "more recently , @xcite obtained nsc    host galaxy correlations using a sample in which he excluded what were likely to be nuclear stellar discs from the galaxy sample of ferrarese et al . , while including an additional 13 nscs in galaxies with velocity dispersions out to about @xmath17 .",
    "graham found that nsc   and mbh  masses follow different scaling correlations with host galaxy properties .",
    "other authors confirmed this result , showing that the mass of nscs scales with the host - galaxy spheroid s velocity dispersion as @xmath18 , while the mass of mbhs follows the much steeper relation @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "although this might suggest that mbhs and nscs did not form from the same mechanism  @xcite , whether the formation of mbhs is connected to the evolution of nscs and whether the two types of central objects grow together or in competition from the same physical process remains unclear .",
    "the observational findings mentioned above provided motivation for theoretical work aimed to understand how nscs form and how their evolution is linked to the evolution of their host galaxy .",
    "two models have been suggested for the formation of nscs : ( i ) the cluster infall scenario , in which stellar clusters are driven to the galactic nucleus by dynamical friction , merge , and build up a nsc  @xcite ; ( ii ) the nuclear star formation scenario , in which gas falls into the nucleus and forms stars  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . due to the inherent complexity of gas dynamics in star formation , which makes the second of these two processes difficult to model ,",
    "theoretical work has been mostly directed toward the cluster infall scenario  ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , both dissipative and dissipationless processes are likely to play an important role in nsc  formation  @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies have employed two different methodologies : @xmath20-body simulations and semi - analytical modeling .",
    "@xmath20-body techniques are used to simulate the last stage of inspiral and merger of stellar clusters in the inner region of galaxies .",
    "these models have shown that a star cluster merger scenario can explain without obvious difficulties the observed properties of nscs , including their density and velocity dispersion profiles  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while these studies make reliable predictions about the aspect of nscs , they suffer from the fact that the adopted initial conditions are often not well motivated , hence the need to rely on semi - analytical models .",
    "these are used to make predictions for the appearance of star clusters , of known mass and radius , in the center of galaxies , and to compute the accumulated mass at the center through dynamical friction migration over a hubble time . in semi - analytical models ,",
    "the rate at which the nsc  grows by accreting young clusters is estimated from empirical cluster formation rates , dynamical friction timescales and dissolution times  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "studies based on semi - analytical approaches have demonstrated that the nsc host galaxy property scaling relations and their half - mass radius  mass relation are both consistent with formation by star cluster accretion  @xcite .",
    "all previous calculations assumed nsc  formation to take place in isolated galactic spheroids , thus neglecting the role of galaxy evolution , mergers , and the role of in - situ star formation .",
    "also , these former idealized attempts could not explore the details of the interplay between mbh  and nsc  evolution . in this paper",
    ", we present a semi - analytical galaxy - formation model that allows us to shed light on exactly these points , i.e. it allows us to assess the role of galaxy mergers , mbh  mergers and nuclear star formation on the growth of nscs .",
    "we follow the formation and evolution of galaxies , mbhs and nscs along cosmic history , including the growth of nscs due to both central migration of stellar clusters and in - situ star formation , while also accounting for dynamical heating from ( binary ) mbhs .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "2 we introduce and discuss the numerical methods employed in our study .",
    "section  3 describes the sample data to which our numerical results are compared . in sections  4 and 5",
    "we describe the main results of our calculations and discuss some of their implications in section  6 .",
    "we summarize in section  7 .",
    "we study the formation of nscs and their co - evolution with mbhs along the merger history of their host galaxies by semianalytical techniques .    first , we consider a purely dissipationless formation model in which stellar clusters form and migrate to the center of a galaxy through dynamical friction . we also consider a second semi - analytical model , which unlike the first follows the formation and merger history of galaxies ( both in their dark - matter and baryonic components )",
    "this allows us to study the formation , evolution and disruption of nscs in a self - consistent way , accounting not only for the dynamical friction - driven inspiral of stellar clusters to the nucleus , but also for star formation in the nuclear gas , and for the effect of galaxy and mbh mergers .",
    "we begin in this section by describing our methodology , highlighting in particular the simplifying approximations that are made in our models .      in our semi - analytical model",
    "@xmath21 a galactic nucleus forms through the orbital decay ( via dynamical friction ) and merger of star clusters in the central region of a galaxy .",
    "this code adopts a rather idealized model of an isolated galactic spheroid and follows the consecutive inspiral of stellar clusters along their orbits until they decay into the galactic center or they are disrupted in the process .",
    "this relatively simple approach has the advantage that the details of the tidal interaction of the clusters with the background galaxy and central mbhare easily included , and in a relatively precise manner . on the other hand ,",
    "as previously stated , this model has the important limitation that galaxy evolution as well as dissipative processes that can lead to star formation episodes in the galactic center are neglected .",
    "another basic assumption made in the @xmath21 model is that mbhs are already in place before nscs grow around them ; moreover we assume that all galaxies contain initially a mbh .",
    "the code is essentially the same as that used by @xcite , and we direct the reader to that paper for a more detailed description . briefly , we represent the galaxy spheroid by a simple power - law density model : @xmath22 , where @xmath23 .",
    "this latter expression assumes that the density of the galactic bulge follows a @xcite profile , @xmath24 , at @xmath25 .",
    "given a mass for the central mbh , @xmath26 , we compute the galaxy density profile slope , scale radius , spheroidal mass and galaxy velocity dispersion by using the corresponding scaling relations that link these properties to @xmath26  @xcite . the galaxy effective radius , @xmath27 , was derived from the size - mass relation given by equation  ( 32 ) of @xcite .",
    "the ratio @xmath28 follows from equations  ( 4 ) and ( 17 ) of @xcite , which give @xmath29 for @xmath30 .",
    "we assign the stellar cluster masses using the cluster initial mass function ( cimf ) , @xmath31 @xcite , and limiting mass values of @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "the stellar clusters are assumed to form continuously over the age of the galaxy .    as commonly done , we assume that the clusters have initially the same distribution as the stars in the galaxy , and that initially a fixed fraction @xmath34 of stars form in strongly bound stellar clusters .",
    "this latter is approximately consistent with the typical cluster formation efficiency for the milky way found by @xcite and it is similar to the value adopted in previous studies  @xcite .",
    "gnedin et al .",
    "showed that by adopting a power - law mass function @xmath31 and a fraction @xmath35 of clustered star formation , one can reproduce the observed density profile of clusters in m87 .",
    "we assume that the central properties of a stellar cluster remain unchanged during inspiral and that @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the cluster core radius and @xmath38 is the cluster tidal  ( limiting ) radius given by  @xcite : @xmath39 with @xmath40 the sum of galactic , mbh  and nsc  potentials , and @xmath41 a `` form factor '' that depends on the density distribution within the cluster .",
    "the mass of a king model is then related to its tidal radius and velocity dispersion via the expression @xmath42 we note that although at first order the central properties of the clusters are not expected to change during inspiral , the stars in a nsc  formed from cluster infalls should arguably end up with the same root - mean - square velocity as the galaxy host , which appears to be consistent with observations ( see * ? ? ?",
    ".    given a cluster of central velocity dispersion @xmath43 the time evolution of its orbital radius is @xmath44^{\\frac{1}{3-\\gamma}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the initial separation from the center , for the coulomb logarithm we take @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is given in equation  ( 1 ) of @xcite .",
    "we approximately account for the dynamical dissolution of the clusters due to their collisional evolution and interaction with the external tidal field of the galaxy by only evolving clusters with dynamical friction time shorter than their dissolution time  [ equation  ( [ diss - t ] ) below ] .",
    "the cluster orbits are evolved using equation  ( [ sfc2 ] ) up to a maximum integration time of @xmath48 , and the nsc  mass is obtained by summing up all the mass transported by the infalling clusters within a radius @xmath49 .",
    "the nsc  radius , @xmath49 , is computed from the recursive relation given by equations ( 14)-(16 ) of @xcite . as we evolve the cluster orbits , we compute their tidal disruption radius due to the galaxy , mbh  and a pre - existing nsc  gravitational fields , adopting a cluster core radius @xmath50 , roughly equal to the median value of the core radii listed in the harris compilation of galactic star clusters  @xcite .",
    "when the clusters reach their tidal disruption radius , the remaining core mass is dispersed around the radius of disruption .",
    "when evaluating the final nsc  density distribution we make the assumption that the stars from the disrupted clusters are isotropically distributed around the center .",
    "we note that in reality the clusters will distribute initially in a disk - like structure , but this will morph into a more spherical distribution over a fraction of the nuclear relaxation timescale  @xcite .    a mbh  binary formed during a galaxy merger",
    "leaves an imprint on the galactic nucleus in the form of a mass deficit , @xmath51 , a decrease in the mass of the nucleus due to ejection of stars on intersecting orbits  @xcite .",
    "we account for this by subtracting a mass @xmath52 @xcite , where @xmath53 is the predicted number of major mergers after the last major accretion event , from the final accumulated mass inside @xmath54 .",
    "the number of mergers @xmath53 is obtained from the galaxy mass using the distributions shown in figure  ( 2 ) of @xcite , where in order to convert @xmath55luminosity to mass we used a constant mass - to - light ratio @xmath56 , as sometimes adopted in the literature for an old stellar population  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "finally we compare the resulting nsc  density profile , obtained after @xmath2gyr of evolution , to the density profile , @xmath57 , of the galaxy , and define a galaxy as _ nucleated _ if at some radius the nsc  stellar density was found to be higher than that of the background galaxy .",
    "this latter condition is based on the fact that if the nsc  densities are below the galaxy density at all radii , then it would be difficult to observationally distinguish the two components .      our galaxy formation model ( hereafter @xmath58 )",
    "is based on that of  @xcite , which was further improved in  @xcite .",
    "more precisely ,  @xcite presented a semi - analytical galaxy formation model tracking the evolution of baryonic structures along dark matter merger trees .",
    "these trees are produced with an extended press - schechter formalism , modified in order to reproduce the results of n - body simulations of dark - matter halos  @xcite , while the baryonic structures include the hot , largely unprocessed intergalactic medium , galactic disks and spheroids ( in both their stellar and cold , chemically - enriched interstellar medium components ) , a low angular momentum reservoir of cold nuclear gas available for accretion onto the central mbh  @xcite , and the mbh itself .",
    "these baryonic components are interconnected by a plethora of interactions , schematically summarized in figure  [ fig_model ] .",
    "also included are environmental and tidal interactions between galaxies during mergers , following simple semi - analytical recipes  @xcite .",
    "moreover ,  @xcite later improved this model by refining the star formation law  adding in particular an explicit dependence on the metallicity  @xcite , as well as a distinction between pseudo - bulges forming from bar instabilities and classical bulges created by major mergers  and by devising more realistic prescriptions for the evolution of the spins of mbhs with cosmic time .    for this work ,",
    "we have further ameliorated the model by including the formation and evolution of nscs ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig_model ] ) .",
    "more precisely , we consider two possible formation channels for these objects , namely one where nscs form from the dynamical friction - driven migration to the nuclear regions of star clusters created further out in the galaxy , and one in which nscs form _ in situ _ as a result of star formation in the nuclear regions .",
    "note that we assume no high redshift seeds for the nscs , i.e. the nsc mass grows from zero at high redshifts to its present - day value through the two aforementioned channels ( this growth being modulated / hindered by the effect of galaxy and black - hole mergers , cf .",
    "section [ sec : mergers ] ) .    in the @xmath58 models described below",
    "we define as nucleated any galaxy containing a central cluster more massive than @xmath59 , as this value corresponds approximately to the lower limit of the observed nsc  mass distribution  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we also define an early- ( late-)type galaxy as one with bulge to total mass ratio @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) . for each of the @xmath58 models that we present , we simulate about 1300 galaxies with dark - matter masses ranging from @xmath62 to @xmath63 .      to implement the dynamical friction - driven migration of star clusters to the central nucleus",
    ", we first assume that star clusters are created during star - formation events with efficiency @xmath64 , both in galactic bulges and disks . in bulges , @xcite and",
    "@xcite assumed a volumetric star - formation rate @xmath65 , while in disks they considered a vertically - averaged rate of star formation @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , we assume that star clusters form in bulges and disks , and that the total mass of the star - cluster population ( in both the bulge and disk ) , @xmath67 , changes with rate @xmath68 where we choose @xmath69 , which is the typical value in the milky way  @xcite .",
    "we stress that plausible values",
    "@xmath34  @xmath70 would only mildly impact the normalization of our results for the @xmath71 relation , and would not affect its slope significantly .",
    "in addition we have tried a model with a variable @xmath64 set to 0.07 , 0.04 and 0.5 in disk , quiescent and starburst galaxies respectively ; these correspond approximately to the values of figure  4 in  @xcite .",
    "the results of this model were found to not significantly differ from those of models with a fixed @xmath64 .",
    "thus , for the sake of simplicity , we present in what follows only the results of a model with fixed @xmath69 .",
    "we then assume that the star clusters formed in the bulge are spatially distributed in the same way as the bulge stellar population , i.e. if that population has density profile @xmath72 , the volumetric number density @xmath73 of star clusters is assumed to satisfy@xmath74 where @xmath75 is the total number of star clusters in the bulge , and @xmath76 is the total bulge mass in stars .",
    "note that following @xcite , we assume a hernquist distribution for @xmath72 ; we refer to @xcite for more details on the choice of the scaling radius for this density profile .",
    "similarly , we assume that the disk s star clusters are distributed according to the same surface density profile as the overall stellar content of the disk , i.e. the superficial number density @xmath77 will satisfy @xmath78 where again @xmath79 is the total number of star clusters in the disk , and @xmath80 is the mass of the stellar disk .",
    "again , for @xmath81 we follow @xcite and adopt an exponential profile ( see @xcite for more details on the calculation of the scaling radius for this distribution ) .    as for the mass distribution of the newly formed star clusters ,",
    "we assume a power - law mass function @xmath82 ( with @xmath83 bulge , disk ) .",
    "combined with equations   and , this gives the distribution functions for the bulge and disk star clusters @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are units of volume and surface .",
    "we assume that these distribution functions are valid for masses @xmath87 for individual star clusters between @xmath88 and @xmath89  @xmath90 , and the normalization factor @xmath91 ensures that the integral over all masses and over the whole volume ( or surface ) is 1 .",
    "note that in our runs we assume @xmath92 ; using the dissipationless model described in section  [ mod1 ] , we find that reducing @xmath93 to @xmath94 has the effect of changing the normalization of the scaling relations by a factor @xmath95 , but did not change their overall slopes .",
    "these distribution functions can then be used to calculate approximately how much mass is lost by the population of star clusters due to their collisional evolution and interaction with the external tidal field of the galaxy ( `` dynamical dissolution '' ) : @xmath96 with @xmath97 and @xmath98 @xmath99 being the halo s virial velocity  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "recent @xmath20-body simulations show that @xmath100 @xcite , which we adopt here . also , note that for simplicity we do not track separately the mass in star clusters in the bulge and that in the disk , but simply follow the evolution of the total mass in star clusters @xmath67 [ cf .",
    "equation ] . in equation",
    "[ and in equations   and   below ] we therefore simply assume that the mass of star clusters in the disk is @xmath101 m_{\\rm gc}$ ] , and that the mass of star clusters in the bulge is @xmath102 m_{\\rm gc}$ ] .    in a similar fashion",
    ", we account for the evaporation of star clusters in isolation through @xmath103 where @xmath104 note that because the evaporation time - scale does not depend on the star cluster s location ( since it describes evaporation in isolation ) , equation can be simplified to @xmath105 note that our models do not include the possibility of close encounters with giant molecular clouds , which in some cases could significantly reduce the clusters lifetime .",
    "also they rely on necessarily simplified models for the galaxy . a more realistic model for the galactic potential might somewhat change the timescales introduced above",
    ". however , we note that analytical models of nsc  formation indicate that the final nsc  mass is not much affected by the assumed slope of the galactic background density profile  ( see section 4 of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the total mass in star clusters also decreases because the individual star clusters fall toward the central nsc , under the effect of dynamical friction , i.e. @xmath106 the dynamical - friction timescale in the bulge is dominated by the interaction with the stellar background , and we therefore follow binney and tremaine ( 2008 ) [ equation ( 8.12 ) ] : @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the bulge velocity dispersion ( related to the halo s virial velocity by @xmath109  @xcite ) and we choose @xmath110 . as for the dynamical friction in the disk , we account for both the interaction with the stellar and gas component , i.e. @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the orbital angular moment of a star cluster of mass @xmath113 belonging to the disk ( and thus moving with velocity @xmath114 at a separation @xmath115 from the galactic center ) , while the angular momentum loss due to dynamical friction is expressed  @xcite in terms of the surface densities @xmath116 and @xmath117 of the disk s stellar and gaseous components , the velocity dispersion of the stars in the disk @xmath118 , and the velocity dispersion / sound speed of the gas in the disk @xmath119  @xcite .",
    "note that for @xmath118 we follow @xcite and assume @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the maximum rotational velocity inside the disk . also observe that in equation we are summing the inverses of the timescales , so that the infall rates due to the dynamical friction from the gas and that due to the stars get summed in equation .",
    "not all of the mass of the star clusters falling toward the nsc eventually accretes onto it , because star clusters get truncated due to the galactic tidal field , and tidally disrupted by the central mbh . to account for these effects",
    "we assume that the rate of change of the nsc mass due to infall of star clusters is @xmath122 where clearly the major difficulty lies in computing the factor @xmath123 .",
    "since it would be computationally prohibitive to evolve the infall of the individual star clusters self - consistently within our semi - analytical galaxy formation model , we calculate @xmath124 with the `` monolithic '' @xmath21 model of section  [ mod1 ] , in order to derive an easy - to - use analytical expression .    more specifically , approximating a star cluster as a king model ,",

    ", we find that more than @xmath132 of the nsc  mass comes from star clusters with initial mass @xmath133 , and that the ( mass - weighted ) mean central velocity dispersion of the star clusters contributing to the nucleus growth is @xmath134 km / s .",
    "when setting @xmath135 , the average initial mass of these star clusters is @xmath136 .",

    "if @xmath141 , we set @xmath142 .      as mentioned above , nscs may also form by star formation in the cold gas accumulating in the galactic center . in the galaxy formation model of @xcite ( and in the improved version of this model used by  @xcite ) , transfer of cold gas to a low - angular momentum nuclear reservoir ",

    "is associated with major galactic mergers , and ( less importantly ) with bar instabilities in the galactic disk .",
    "note that the physical mechanism responsible for the loss of angular momentum of the cold gas and its transfer to this nuclear reservoir may be the radiation drag caused by the newly formed stars  @xcite , or the reshuffling / shocks of the gas as a consequence of disk instabilities or mergers . more generally , a correlation between bulge star formation and mbh  accretion / growth is expected based on the @xmath148 relation for mbhs and on the parallelism between the quasar luminosity and star formation history  @xcite .",

    "the similarity between the results of the two models with and without in - situ star formation suggests that dynamical friction migration of star clusters is a fundamental process for the growth of the nuclei .",

    "however , a more careful analysis of the plot also shows that such a model fails to explain the existence of nscs of mass @xmath294 which are clearly present in the observational data .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is that in @xmath21 we have assumed that all galaxies contain a mbh , and that these mbhs are in place at the center of all initial galaxy models before the nscs grow around them .",
    "these assumptions are not fully supported by our galaxy formation model  ( see section  [ z - ev - sec ] ) and artificially lead to an enhanced mass removal from the stellar clusters accreting onto the central nsc , because of the tidal field of the mbh .    the galaxy evolution model @xmath58 produces scaling relations at @xmath286 that are in remarkably good agreement with the observed correlations .",
    "the scatter around the median value clearly increases at the high mass end of the nsc  distribution .",
    "a large population of nscs are produced at @xmath293 that are significantly underweight with respect to what the same model would predict by simply extrapolating the scaling correlations and scatter from low ( @xmath295 ) to high galaxy masses . in the following section we argue that the formation of such  underweight \" nscs and , consequently , the apparent bending of the scaling correlations can be explained in terms of the interaction of the nscs with their host galaxy mbhs .      in our semi - analytical models",
    "mbhs affect the formation and evolution of nscs in two important ways : ( i ) the strong tidal field of the central mbh  accelerates the mass loss from stellar clusters as they enter its sphere of influence and eventually disrupts them as they come closer than a distance @xmath296 , where @xmath297 after a cluster is disrupted , most of its stars are dispersed around @xmath296 , which will limit the nuclear density within this radius .",
    "thus , a preexisting mbhwill limit the amount of mass that can be transported to the center by decaying stellar clusters  @xcite . as mentioned earlier [ cf .",

    "( hereafter we refer to these models as models `` without mbh  heating '' . ) the blue and red curves in the middle panels of figure  [ main ] show the scaling correlations resulting from such models . when compared to our fiducial models ( upper panels ) , these new integrations produce steeper and significantly tighter @xmath71 and @xmath298 relations .",
    "this indicates that the break in the nsc  scaling relations , for which we found evidence in the observational data , can be attributed to the interaction of nscs with their companion mbhs .",

    "this is roughly the value of @xmath108 at which nscs appear to be significantly affected by their host galaxy mbhs in our models .",

    "we conclude that in @xmath58 the crucial ingredient to reproduce the @xmath265-host galaxy property scaling relations is the scouring effect of mbh  binaries , while the tidal stripping of migrating clusters by central mbhs is only a secondary effect in these models .",
    "we remark that the @xmath58 model has a clear advantage over the @xmath21 model , because the former follows the _ hierarchical _ evolution of nscs and mbhs along merger - trees , while the latter assumes a _ monolithic _ evolution .",

    "we believe that the reason for this discrepancy is that discreteness effects are not accounted for in @xmath58 as argued in the following . in this latter model , we compute the flux of mass accreting onto the nucleus by _ averaging _ over the initial mass function of the stellar cluster population . in @xmath21 , we simulate instead the inspiral of each of the formed clusters , drawing their masses from the same initial mass function .",
    "because of the initial small number of stellar clusters in low mass galaxies , and because of the steep power law that we adopt for their initial mass function , some of these galaxies will host no cluster that is massive enough to decay to the center before being disrupted in the process .",
    "this suggests that the lack of nscs in spheroids less luminous than @xmath420 is a consequence of the initial low number of massive clusters in these galaxies .",

    "even if a nsc  is fully disrupted during a merger , a stellar cusp of mass of order @xmath341 the mass of the black hole and extending out to one tenth its sphere of influence will reform over the relaxation time  @xcite . although cusp regrowth is not expected to have an important effect on the mass evolution of the nscs , it is worth discussing it , as the ability of a mbh  to shape a galactic nucleus and the observational consequences depend on whether cores are regenerated or preserved after mergers .",
    "@xcite performed @xmath20-body simulations to investigate the evolution of merging star clusters with seed black holes .",
    "using black holes masses of @xmath421 their host nsc  ones , they investigated how the binary coalescence dynamically heats and destroys the surrounding clusters . while @xcite argued that this mechanism provides a pathway to explain the observed reduction in the nucleus - to - galaxy stellar mass ratio as one proceeds from dwarf to giant elliptical galaxies",
    ", they did not discuss how their results would be affected by two - body relaxation after the mbh  binary merges , and between mergers .    during galaxy mergers ,",
    "cores are carved out in the stellar distribution , with radii of order the influence radius of the massive binary .",
    "this makes nsc  susceptible to disruption . on the other hand ,",
    "if the supply of stars is continuously replenished , the damage to the nsc  can be much smaller .",
    "furthermore , even if a large core is formed , a stellar density cusp can regrow via energy exchanges between stars moving in the gravitational field of the mbh  remnant .",
    "black holes with masses of @xmath421 that of the nsc , such as those considered in @xcite , correspond to low mass galaxies with a short ( @xmath422yr ) relaxation time . from equation  ( [ nsc - bh ] )",
    "one finds that such a low mass ratio corresponds to a mbh  mass of @xmath423 . using equation @xmath424 ,",
    "this corresponds to a host stellar spheroid velocity dispersion of @xmath425 . in such low mass galaxies ,",
    "the cusp will regenerate itself in about @xmath426gyr from the infall of a second black hole , as collisional relaxation drives the stellar distribution toward its steady state form  @xcite .",
    "we conclude that in low mass spheroids the effect of mbh  binaries on the host nscdensity distribution is expected to be minimal , and their imprint on the nuclear properties is expected to be erased after a short time .",
    "the probability that a galaxy of the size of the milky way experienced a major merger ( i.e. , with mass ratio larger than 0.3 ) after @xmath427 is about @xmath428  @xcite .",
    "galaxies of such luminosities have relaxation times that are longer than the age of the galaxy , but which are short enough that two - body relaxation might have affected their central clusters .",
    "these galaxies might have nuclei that are still evolving toward their steady state after they were dynamically heated by a mbh  binary .",
    "thus , the results of our models imply that `` under - massive '' nscs in galaxies with bulge mass @xmath429 might still carry an imprint of the merger history of their host galaxy , in the form of a density core that extends out to a small fraction of the central mbh  influence radius .",
    "whether these nscs will turn out to harbor parsec - scale cores will be addressed in the future with high resolution imaging , which will enable to resolve the crowded stellar environment of nscs  @xcite .",
    "nscs and mbhs represent important central components of galaxies that bear witness to their formation history .",
    "our aim has been to generate a numerical framework to better understand how the central structures of galaxies formed , and how the evolution of mbhs and nscs is connected to that of their host galaxies .",
    "we have studied the evolution of nscs in a cosmological context , by taking into account the growth of mbhs by merging subhalos containing both mbhs and nscs .",

    "specifically , the evolution of dark matter halos along the merger trees includes their baryonic components such as hot gas , stellar and gaseous bulges , and stellar and gaseous galactic disks .",
    "we study the simultaneous evolution of mbhs and nscs in our galaxy formation model .",
    "the main results of our work are summarized in the following :    \\(1 ) the mass growth of nscs is seen to be regulated by inspiral of star clusters , in - situ star formation as well as galaxy and mbh mergers .",
    "we have found that both cluster inspirals and in - situ star formation contribute a significant fraction of the total mass of nscs .",
    "\\(2 ) we found that in - situ star formation ( as well as growth through migrating clusters ) , generates nsc  - host galaxy scaling relations that are much shallower than the same correlations for mbhs , in agreement with observations .",
    "\\(3 ) in our model , the merger history of galaxies after @xmath430 plays a key role in determining the structure of the nscs observed today .",
    "core - depletion due to gravitational slingshot of host galaxy stars by inspiralling mbhs forming during galaxy mergers has a negligible impact on the evolution of nscs in low mass galaxies , while it leads to their full disruption in galaxies more massive than @xmath431 . in galaxies of intermediate luminosity  ( @xmath432 )",
    ", mbh mergers cause the partial dissolution of the clusters .",
    "such partially eroded clusters appear at @xmath286 significantly underweight relative to linear nsc - host spheroid scaling correlations .",
    "the presence of an under - massive nsc population results in an increased scatter of the nsc - host galaxy empirical correlations at high galaxy luminosities , for which we find evidence in observational data .",
    "\\(4 ) we identify @xmath311 as the critical value of mbh  mass above which nscs are significantly affected .",
    "once the galactic mbh  mass grows above this value , mbh  binary mergers become highly disruptive for the central nsc  leading to the formation of a central low density core . for galaxies more massive than the milky way , after such low density core forms , the central galactic regions are likely to remain depleted of stars throughout the subsequent evolution of the galaxy .",
    "\\(5 ) our models predict that the fraction of nucleated early type galaxies containing an accreting mbh  ( with bolometric luminosity @xmath310 ) increases from @xmath433 at @xmath434 to @xmath435 at @xmath436 .",
    "these fractions are found to be much smaller for late type galaxies , for which only @xmath437 of nucleated galaxies with @xmath438 also contain an active mbh . among galaxies of all types , the fraction of mixed systems containing both a mbh  and a nsc  is about @xmath439 at @xmath440 .",
    "\\(6 ) we found that the results shown in this paper are quite robust when we change the cluster formation efficiency , @xmath441 ; when we allow @xmath64 to vary with galactic properties  ( e.g. we set it to 0.07 , 0.04 and 0.5 in disk , quiescent and starburst galaxies respectively ; * ? ? ? * ) ; when we change the mbh  seed model  ( i.e. light - seed models vs heavy - seed models , with several halo occupation numbers at high redshift ) as well as other details of our model , such as merger - tree resolution , initial redshift of the simulations , prescriptions for agn feedback , etc .    in conclusion",
    ", our study supports a scenario in which black holes form inside nscs with a low - mass fraction , so that nscs are initially the dominant central component of galaxies .",
    "after their formation , nscs and mbhs grow in parallel on their own scaling correlations with host galaxy properties , with nscs dominating in low mass spheroids and mbhs dominating in high mass galaxies .",
    "the simple fact that nscs and mbhs grow on different scaling correlations explains the well known transition from mbh- to nsc - dominated galaxies as one proceeds from dwarfs to giant ellipticals , without the need of invoking competitive feedback processes from young nscs and/or agn activity .",
