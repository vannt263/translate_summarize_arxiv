    "the dynamics of nonlinear waves is central to understanding the behaviour of a wide range of physical systems .",

    "( e.g.  @xcite ) , waves in optical fibres ( e.g.  @xcite ) , and water waves ( e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) . an important theme of much of this work has been understanding modulational instabilities of plane waves , and in recent years a particular focus has been the instability of nonlinearly coupled waves .",
    "examples include studies of counter - propagating waves in parametrically forced systems ( e.g.  @xcite ) , standing water waves ( e.g.  @xcite ) , co - propagating waves in shallow water  @xcite , and more general energy exchange processes in coupled sine - gordon equations  @xcite .",
    "other interesting recent results related to the dynamics of nonlinearly coupled waves include the rigorous proof of the existence of standing water waves  @xcite , and a study of resonant triad dynamics in weakly damped faraday waves with two - frequency forcing  @xcite .",
    "our present study is devoted to multi - component systems that may be modelled by nonlinear partial differential equations with one space dimension @xmath2 , and with time @xmath3 , which admit linear stable wave solutions of the form @xmath4 .",
    "here @xmath5 , where importantly this dispersion relation has several branches .",
    "we aim to study the nonlinear development of several plane waves with the same wavenumber @xmath6 , taking particular care to diagnose any modulational instabilities .",
    "as is customary we shall assume that each wave amplitude @xmath7 is @xmath8 where @xmath9 , thus enabling the weakly nonlinear regime to be studied using asymptotic methods .",
    "when there is just a single wave , the procedure is well - known .",
    "there is a distinguished lengthscale for modulations to the wave amplitude , @xmath10 , on which the effects of dispersion and nonlinearity become simultaneously important , on a timescale @xmath11 .",
    "then , in a reference frame moving with the group velocity of the wave , the governing nonlinear partial differential equations can be reduced via the method of multiple scales to a nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation for the wave amplitude @xmath7 ( e.g. @xcite ) . as is well known ,",
    "if @xmath12 has the same sign as the coefficient of the cubic nonlinear term , then a plane wave is modulationally unstable @xcite ( sometimes called a benjamin  feir instability , or sideband instability @xcite ) .",
    "one can apply a similar methodology for the case of two waves , possibly counter - propagating , say @xmath13 . with the same scaling as above , in general the governing nonlinear partial differential equations can be reduced to non - locally coupled nls equations for @xmath7 and @xmath14 @xcite . for unbounded or periodic systems , the coupling terms either disappear or can be eliminated by a phase transformation @xcite , and so modulational instability is determined by the instability of the individual waves .",
    "however , if the group velocities @xmath15 and @xmath16 are equal , or differ only by an @xmath8 quantity , then one obtains locally coupled nls equations , and there may be additional instabilities solely due to this coupling , even when both waves are individually stable @xcite .    more generally , one can pursue an asymptotic multiple - scales expansion in which the wave amplitudes , of @xmath8 , are modulated on a lengthscale of @xmath17 .",
    "then , retaining all terms of @xmath18 , the governing partial differential equations can be reduced to coupled nls equations for the two wave amplitudes . expressed here in unscaled variables",
    ", they are of the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the group velocity , and @xmath21 are constant nonlinear coefficients .",
    "there is a corresponding equation for @xmath14 , with a different transport term due to the group velocity @xmath22 . on the right - hand side , the linear dispersive terms of @xmath23",
    "are retained , even though these are strictly smaller than the @xmath24 transport terms on the left - hand side .",
    "note that for a single wave , the transport term can be removed by moving to the group velocity reference frame , but this is generally not possible in coupled systems with differing group velocities .",
    "the nonlinear terms on the right - hand side are @xmath25 , and with the conventional nls choice that @xmath26 , these equations can then be systematically reduced to the aforementioned non - locally coupled nls equations , provided that @xmath27 is not equal or close to @xmath28 .",
    "alternatively , one could choose @xmath29 giving a balance between the transport terms and the nonlinear terms , leading to non - dispersive and nonlinearly coupled envelope equations . nevertheless ,",
    "although coupled nls equations of the form ( [ e : cnls ] ) are not generally asymptotically exact , in that they contain small dispersive terms which are strictly beyond the leading order transport terms , they may be useful as they do capture the leading order dispersive and nonlinear effects .",
    "studies based on this type of approach have recently been made for the parametric generation of waves by an external oscillatory field in the framework of two coupled , damped , parametrically driven nls equations ( see @xcite and references therein ) , and for the interaction of two waves in shallow water in the framework of the kdv equation @xcite .",
    "the aims of this study are to extend our understanding of the nonlinear behaviour of multiple - wave systems , to derive asymptotic equations to describe many interacting waves , and to assess the applicability and accuracy of the various resulting coupled wave models , with particular reference to the modulational instability of plane waves .",
    "this work is performed in the context of energy exchange processes in two - component systems , permitting us to examine explicitly both two - wave and four - wave dynamics .",
    "we consider a system of coupled nonlinear klein ",
    "gordon equations @xmath30 where the subscripts denote partial derivatives . here , @xmath31 is a potential function for the nonlinear coupling , and @xmath32 is the ratio of the acoustic velocities of the components @xmath33 and @xmath34 . in its simplest form , ( [ 1.1 ] ) describes the long - wave dynamics of two coupled one - dimensional periodic chains of particles , the elements of each chain being linked by linear coupling , and the chains themselves being linked by the nonlinear coupling @xcite .",
    "applications of this model include nonlinear waves in bi - layers with imperfect interfaces @xcite , and dynamical processes in dna @xcite .",
    "the particular case we shall study is that for which the potential function is @xmath35 .",
    "then the system ( [ 1.1 ] ) reduces to a set of coupled sine - gordon equations : @xmath36 where the variable @xmath33 replaces @xmath37 , compared to ( [ 1.1 ] ) .",
    "in addition to the two applications mentioned above , the coupled sine - gordon equations generalize the frenkel  kontorova dislocation model @xcite ( see also @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "as shown in @xcite , processes involving an exchange of energy between the two components of the system are possible due to the existence of two branches of the dispersion relation .",
    "these processes represent a continuum generalization of energy exchange in a system of coupled pendulums @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the mechanism of such energy exchange is essentially linear , with energy being transferred between the physical components of the system , rather than the wave components .",
    "therefore , a natural question to ask is , what happens to these linear plane wave solutions under the influence of nonlinearity , especially if they are modulationally perturbed ? here , we are interested in studying such modulational instabilities in a more or less generic situation , in contrast to the recent papers on targeted energy transfer , which placed certain restrictions on the physical properties of the system @xcite .",
    "first steps in this direction have been made in our recent work @xcite .",
    "there we dealt with a particular solution of  ( [ 1.2 ] ) involving only a single pair of waves , and considered its modulational instability in the context of two non - locally coupled nls equations . in the present study , we generalise this analysis to two pairs of counter - propagating waves , which generally leads to a system of four non - locally coupled nls equations .",
    "note that the four - wave case is essentially different from the two - wave case , since the number of characteristic variables now differs from the number of independent variables , making the strict derivation of the asymptotic evolution equations not so straightforward .",
    "however , as we show here , the same methodology can , in general , be used to derive @xmath38 non - locally coupled nls equations for the co - evolution of @xmath38 waves .",
    "we also re - examine the two - wave stability problem using the coupled nls equations , and compare the predictions with those of the non - locally coupled nls equations . throughout",
    ", numerical simulations of the governing coupled sine - gordon equations are used to assess the various predictions over a range of wave amplitudes .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "s : exchange ] , we discuss solutions exhibiting periodic energy exchange between the two components .",
    "section  [ s : models ] is devoted to the derivation of asymptotic models for weakly nonlinear waves .",
    "specifically , we derive non - locally coupled nls equations for the regime with modulations on a lengthscale of @xmath10 , and also non - dispersive nonlinearly coupled envelope equations for the regime with modulations on a lengthscale of @xmath11 .",
    "then we motivate the introduction of the coupled nls equations , and give them for the case of two pairs of counter - propagating waves ( correcting an error in @xcite ) .",
    "in section  [ s:2wave ] , we study modulational instability of weakly nonlinear coupled two - wave solutions in each of the respective models , extending our previous study @xcite . in section  [ s:4wave ]",
    ", we study modulational instability of weakly nonlinear four - wave solutions , using two asymptotic models . numerical simulations of the system ( [ 1.2 ] ) of coupled sine - gordon equations are presented in section  [ s : numerics ] , with a focus on the growth of any modulational instabilities , and the numerical results are compared with the theoretical predictions of sections  [ s:2wave ] and  [ s:4wave ] .",
    "we conclude in section  [ s : conclu ] .",
    "the system ( [ 1.1 ] ) is lagrangian , with density @xmath39 for any function @xmath40 , the system ( [ 1.1 ] ) has conservation laws for energy and momentum .",
    "( in particular cases , there are additional conservation laws , which can be found using results from a lie group classification of these equations  @xcite , and by using the noether theorem ( e.g.  @xcite ) ) .",
    "the energy conservation law for the system ( [ 1.2 ] ) has the form @xmath41 for periodic solutions in @xmath42 , we define domain integrated average energies @xmath43 @xmath44 describing the energy in the @xmath33-component , the energy in the @xmath34-component , and the energy of coupling , respectively .",
    "then the domain integrated average energy @xmath45 is simply @xmath46 although @xmath45 is constant , we can identify solutions that have a time - periodic exchange of energy between @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "when @xmath50 , the coupled sine - gordon equations ( [ 1.2 ] ) reduce to a linear system . looking for a solution of the form @xmath51 leads to the dispersion relation @xmath52 ,        { \\label{omega12}}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",

    "for example , if @xmath60 , then @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "we first consider a superposition of two linear waves , taken to be right - propagating , with the same positive wavenumber @xmath6 but different frequencies @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "further , we suppose that one component , taken to be @xmath33 , is initially excited , while the other component @xmath34 is initially at rest .",
    "the corresponding initial conditions are @xmath65 and one may write the time - dependent solution as @xmath66 where @xmath67 as discussed in more detail in  @xcite , this solution describes an exchange of energy between waves travelling in the two components @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the amplitude of the wave propagating in the @xmath33 component varies between its initial value @xmath68 , and a smaller non - zero value @xmath69 .",
    "there is a full exchange in the wave amplitudes from zero to non - zero values when @xmath70 then @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and the solution ( [ 2.3 ] ) reduces to @xmath73 this is illustrated in figure 1 , for the case @xmath74 . if @xmath60 , then ( [ 2.3a ] ) can be satisfied only for @xmath75 , while @xmath6 is arbitrary .",
    "if @xmath76 , then ( [ 2.3a ] ) can not be satisfied if @xmath77 . otherwise , ( [ 2.3a ] ) is satisfied for a single wavenumber @xmath78 .",

    "using @xmath80 , one may show from ( [ e ] ) and ( [ 2.5 ] ) that @xmath81 . from ( [ 2.5 ] ) we see that there is a partial exchange of energy between @xmath33 and @xmath34 , with period @xmath82 . however , if @xmath83 is small enough , i.e.  if the frequencies @xmath84 and @xmath85 are close enough for some wavenumber @xmath6 , then at @xmath86 the @xmath33-component is almost in equilibrium and almost all of its energy is lost , whilst at @xmath87 the @xmath34-component is almost in equilibrium and almost all of its energy is lost . if @xmath88 , then the period @xmath89 of the energy exchange tends to infinity .",
    "there exists a corresponding solution to ( [ 2.3 ] ) consisting of a superposition of two left - propagating waves .",
    "a combination of this left - propagating solution and the right - propagating solution ( [ 2.3 ] ) is obtained by using the initial conditions @xmath90 we then obtain a standing wave involving two pairs of counter - propagating waves : @xmath91 with @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 as given by ( [ 2.3b ] ) .",
    "the amplitude of the standing wave in the @xmath33 component varies between @xmath68 and @xmath95 , so that once again there is only a partial exchange between the amplitude of the components , unless condition ( [ 2.3a ] ) is satisfied .",
    "then , we have a full exchange , and ( [ 2.6 ] ) becomes @xmath96 where we note that @xmath97 , from ( [ 2.3b ] ) .",

    "nevertheless , the general pattern of a partial energy exchange on a timescale @xmath101 remains .",

    "some examples of this exchange will be given in the numerical simulations of section  [ s : numerics ] .",
    "note that the role of @xmath3 and @xmath2 is interchangeable here ; one can consider a superposition of waves with one and the same frequency , but different wavenumbers .      an exact nonlinear two - wave solution describing energy exchange between the two components @xmath33 and @xmath34 of the system ( [ 1.2 ] ) can be found if @xmath104 , i.e. , if the characteristic velocities of the components coincide @xcite .",
    "it is given in terms of jacobi elliptic functions : @xmath105 where @xmath106 , @xmath107 , from ( [ omega12 ] ) .",
    "when @xmath108 ( i.e.  @xmath109 ) , the nonlinear solution ( [ 3.1 ] ) describes a full periodic exchange between the two components of the system ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the form of the solution for small amplitude can be calculated by taking the limit @xmath110 in ( [ 3.1 ] ) .",
    "using the well - known approximation ( e.g.  @xcite ) @xmath111 one can eliminate the secular terms by renormalizing the frequencies @xmath112 in the solution ( [ 3.1 ] ) , and thus find an asymptotic expansion with leading order terms : @xmath113 where @xmath114 . setting @xmath115 and @xmath116 , the leading order terms of ( [ 3.2 ] )",

    "the generalization is not straightforward , since the number of characteristic variables now differs from the number of independent variables , whereas they are the same in the two - wave case .",
    "however , these potential difficulties can be readily overcome , and the approach we describe here can generally be applied to any number of waves .    we suppose that @xmath7 , @xmath14 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 are functions of the long lengthscale @xmath140 , in which case they must also depend on both slow timescales @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",

    "finally , we use the periodicity of @xmath14 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 to convert the final three integral terms of ( [ atemp ] ) to averages over one period . performing similar operations for ( [ abcdeq2b ] ) ,",
    "( [ abcdeq2c ] ) and ( [ abcdeq2d ] ) gives @xmath176 where @xmath177 these non - locally coupled nls equations govern the weakly nonlinear evolution of the wave amplitudes in the general case , when @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath178 are all @xmath174 .",
    "if @xmath27 , @xmath28 are @xmath174 but @xmath179 , then the averaging process described above fails , and we write @xmath180 then , rather than ( [ abcdform1 ] ) , the solvability conditions at @xmath8 give @xmath181 , @xmath182 , @xmath183 , @xmath184 , where @xmath185 at @xmath25 we obtain equations similar to ( [ abcdeq2a])([abcdeq2d ] ) , but with additional terms @xmath186 , @xmath187 , @xmath188 , @xmath189 on the left - hand side .",
    "we then once again perform an averaging operation , yet this time @xmath7 and @xmath121 are now both functions of @xmath190 and @xmath89 , whilst @xmath14 and @xmath122 are both functions of @xmath191 and @xmath89 .",
    "thus , the final integral terms can be considerably simplified , and rather than ( [ abcdeq3 ] ) we obtain @xmath192 with the coefficients defined as before . there is now a local coupling between the @xmath7 and @xmath121 modes , and between the @xmath14 and @xmath122 modes .",
    "if one permits @xmath27 and @xmath28 to be @xmath8 , then three other scenarios arise in which the averaging process fails .",
    "if @xmath193 but @xmath194 , then using the obvious extension of the above analysis one obtains a system in which @xmath7 and @xmath14 are locally coupled , whilst @xmath121 and @xmath122 satisfy non - locally coupled nls equations .",

    "immediately yields a system of coupled nls equation for @xmath7 , @xmath14 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 , with no non - local coupling , which is equivalent to system ( [ abcdeq5 ] ) introduced below .",
    "however , none of these scenarios are further considered here , since @xmath27 and @xmath28 are typically @xmath174 for the sine - gordon system ( [ 1.2 ] ) .",
    "an alternative approach is to seek a system with linear dispersive terms , unlike ( [ abcdeq1 ] ) , only local nonlinear coupling , unlike ( [ abcdeq3 ] ) and ( [ abcdeq4 ] ) , and with no a priori restrictions on the size of the group velocities , unlike ( [ abcdeq3 ] ) , ( [ abcdeq4 ] ) and the other systems mentioned at the end of section  [ s : long ] .",
    "such a model is obtained , for instance , by allowing the wave amplitudes @xmath7 , @xmath14 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 to depend on the long lengthscale @xmath140 and the slow timescale @xmath198 , whilst retaining all terms up to order @xmath25 .",
    "the result is @xmath199 in this form the linear dispersive and nonlinear terms are of the same relative order , but @xmath8 smaller than the transport terms . if instead we had used the variables @xmath200 , @xmath201 , then we would have had a balance between the transport terms and the nonlinear terms , with the linear dispersive terms being relatively @xmath127 . only in certain special cases",
    "may one simply rescale @xmath2 and @xmath3 so that all terms of ( [ abcdeq5 ] ) are simultaneously of the same order .",
    "for instance , if only one wave is present , then in a reference frame moving at the group velocity of the wave one may use @xmath202 and @xmath203 . similarly ,",
    "if @xmath138 , and @xmath204 , one may perform the same operation to obtain coupled nls equations for @xmath7 and @xmath121 .",
    "nevertheless , ( [ abcdeq5 ] ) is an appealing model on purely physical grounds .",
    "higher order terms , both linear and nonlinear , could , in principle , be dynamically important . indeed , since the effects of transport , dispersion , and leading order nonlinearity are captured , models of this type are widely used in studies of weakly nonlinear wave phenomena , as mentioned already in the introduction .",
    "there is an analogy here with the well - known boussinesq equations often used to model the two - way propagation of water waves .",

    "thus , for small amplitude conditions , the coupling term @xmath242 in ( [ sw1 ] ) is not important , so that even when @xmath218 is small the growth rate is approximately determined by the uncoupled instability in @xmath121 .",

    "as shown in table  [ t : small ] , there is now generally a small discrepancy between the numerically determined growth rate and the best theoretical prediction . we speculate that this is an effect of the wave amplitude  recall that in the linear solution the maximum amplitude reached by @xmath33 or @xmath34 is 0.4 , twice that of the two - wave simulations .",
    "this point will be clarified in the next section .",
    "we now consider how @xmath400 and the functions @xmath406 , @xmath407 change as @xmath68 is increased , for three different parameter sets .",

    "further , when the system is close to the integrable case at @xmath60 , the time evolution is distinguished by a remarkable almost periodic sequence of energy exchange scenarios , with spatial patterns alternating between approximately uniform wavetrains and localized structures . as @xmath32 moves away from 1 , the time evolution becomes more disordered .",
    "although the whole of this study was performed for a two - component set of coupled sine - gordon  equations , we would expect similar phenomena to arise in a wide class of nonlinear wave systems .",
    "thus , in addition to applications to multi - component systems such as those mentioned in the introduction , processes of the type considered here should arise in other physical systems which can support several wave modes .",
    "for instance , an interesting example might be energy exchange between nonlinear internal waves in a layered , or continuously stratified , fluid .",
