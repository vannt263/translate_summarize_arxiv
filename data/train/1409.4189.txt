    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are the most luminous explosions in the universe .",
    "although highly transient , they afford a good laboratory to study astrophysics in extreme conditions .",
    "the prompt gamma - ray emission refers to the emission component detected by the gamma - ray detector and is commonly interpreted as emission from internal shocks ( e.g. , rees & mszros 1994 , 2005 ; daigne & mochkovitch 1998 ; peer et al .",
    "2006 ) or internal magnetic energy dissipation processes ( e.g. , usov 1992 ; giannios & spruit 2006 ; zhang & yan 2011 ) .",
    "the prompt emission is often followed by an afterglow that is the multi - wavelength radiation from the external shock produced by interactions between the ejecta from the fireball and the ambient medium ( see , e.g. , zhang & mszros 2004 and gao et al .",
    "2013 for a review ) .",
    "the identification of the first grb redshift by metzger et al .",
    "( 1997 ; grb 970508 ) revealed the cosmological origin and the vast energy release from grbs , which allows detection out to extreme distances , e.g. , @xmath1 ( tanvir et al .",
    "2009 ; salvaterra et al .",
    "2009 ) and possibly at redshifts as high as @xmath2 ( cucchiara et al . 2011 ) .",
    "however , the transient nature of grbs means that only a limited number have spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "this motivates a search for correlations between grb luminosity and various observable parameters in order to derive _ pseudo - redshifts _ for grb events without spectroscopic redshifts ( e.g. , norris et al . 2000 ; lloyd - ronning et al .",
    "2002 ; firmani et al . 2004 ; kocevski & liang 2006 ; schmidt 2009 ) .",
    "there is evidence for potential luminosity evolution in the gamma - ray band ( salvaterra et al .",
    "2012 ) , but the luminosity function ( lf ) is strongly dependent upon the instrumental detection function , and this complicates the interpretation of the results .    following the identification of the first optical counterpart of a grb in 1997 february 28 ( van paradijs et al .",
    "1997 ) , many statistical studies of optical afterglow ( oa ) light curves have been carried out , resulting in our understanding of the general features of the light curve .",
    "dai et al .",
    "( 2009 ) compared the cumulative distributions of peak gamma - ray photon fluxes and showed that _ swift _  and batse samples come from the same parent population of bursts .",
    "morphological studies of light curves based on statistical analyses of large samples indicate that there are several emission components in the optical afterglow ( e.g. , liang & zhang 2006 ; panaitescu & vestrand 2008 , 2011 ; kann et al . 2010 ; 2011 ) .",
    "two universal tracks of the late optical luminosity light curves have been found ( e.g. , nardini et al .",
    "2006 , kann et al .",
    "kann et al .",
    "( 2010 , 2011 ) compared optical light curves of different types of grbs in the pre-_swift _  and _ swift _  eras to study the distribution of early luminosities at 43.2 seconds in the bursts rest frame , with known redshifts and host - galaxy extinctions .",
    "they found that the luminosity distribution can be approximated by three gaussians .",
    "typical features of grb oa light curves comprise an early bump and plateau components ( panaitescu & vestrand 2008 , 2011 ; li et al . 2012 ; liang et al .",
    "2013 ; wang et al . 2013 ) .",
    "wang et al . ( 2013 ) found that a single power - law provides good description of the lf at 10@xmath3s .",
    "most of the optical data for these studies , however , were collected from inhomogeneous observations with different instruments .",
    "another issue is that optical observations often only start after the end of prompt gamma - ray emission .",
    "the optical lf of grb afterglows is therefore poorly known since no complete sample within a given threshold is available .",
    "the detection of an optical counterpart of a grb depends on the instrument , exposure time , observation epoch , etc . therefore , a homogeneous data set from a single instrument , e.g. , the robotic optical transient search experiment iii ( rotse - iii ) in this work , can reduce these uncertainties .",
    "an analysis of early ( e.g. , at 100s ) and homogeneous data after the onset of the burst is desirable to facilitate the interpretation of grbs optical lf .",
    "although the _ swift _  satellite has led to an increase in the number of grbs with good redshift determinations , the sample is still not sufficiently large to directly measure the lf , and is affected by various biases . since",
    "long grbs are associated with the death of massive stars , the assumption that grb rate traces the star - formation rate ( sfr ) has been used by many studies to constrain the grb lf ( e.g. , lamb & reichart 2000 ; choudhury & srianand 2002 ; natarajan et al .",
    "2005 ; daigne et al .",
    "following this methodology , and assuming the most recent sfr determinations , we derive the optical lf of grbs by fitting the observed rotse - iii flux distributions at 100s after the prompt gamma - ray emission .",
    "this allows us to construct the optical lf of grbs without needing to know their redshifts .",
    "the assumption we make is that the global rate of grb oas is proportional to the sfr and lf .    in this paper , we take advantage of the large sample of grbs observed by rotse - iii to explore the shape of the optical lf at early emission phases .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present our grb sample and the method we used to reproduce the flux distribution of the grbs ; our results are described in section 3 ; and section 4 concludes with a discussion . in this paper , we adopt @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 .",
    "rotse - iii is a network of four identical 0.45-m telescopes distributed around the world to promptly observe oa of grbs ( akerlof et al .",
    "we use a sample of rotse - iii data to derive the grb optical lf .",
    "the observed grb oa rate is assumed to be a convolution of the optical lf with the cosmic grb rate history . since the intrinsic lf shape is affected by the instrumental sensitivity , we use simulations to determine this effect .",
    "we selected our sample of grbs from rotse - iii observations between 2005 february and 2011 july . for uniformity , we defined an epoch for brightness measurement to be 100s after the burst ( with an equivalent exposure time of 5s ) . a non - detection , namely a 3@xmath8 upper limit measurement , is also considered if it meets the following two criteria .",
    "first , we only consider grbs that were triggered by the _ swift _  satellite , in order to have a uniform solid angle of sky coverage ( see section [ sec : opticallf ] below ) .",
    "second , the grb must have rotse - iii observations both before and after 100s , thereby allowing an interpolation to 100s .",
    "we have not included grb 080319b , the naked - eye grb , which was observed under inclement conditions with ccd condensation ( swan et al .",
    "for upper - limit measurements , we used a transformation factor to allow for different exposure times . since most of the upper - limit measurements were with an exposure of 5s , we normalized all the longer exposure times ( either 20s or 60s ) to 5s exposures .",
    "some grbs have optical detections in exposures longer than 5s , but their observed magnitudes are fainter than the equivalent 5s limiting magnitude of the instrument ( e.g. , grb050401 ; 8 grbs in total , which are marked with stars in table 1 ) .",
    "these bursts are considered to be non - detections for the purpose of optical lf construction .",
    "our final sample consists of 58 grbs with 18 detections and 40 upper - limit measurements .",
    "some of the detections have been published earlier ( yost et al .",
    ", 2007a , b ; rykoff et al . 2009 ; yuan et al .",
    "2008 ; yuan 2010 ) . for unpublished data",
    ", we use the rotse - iii photometry package ( rphot ; rykoff et al .",
    "2009 ) to perform psf photometry .",
    "since all the rotse - iii observations were taken unfiltered , and the response of the instrument is approximately the @xmath9 band ( rykoff et al .",
    "2009 ) , we adopt @xmath9 as our bandpass for photometry .",
    "we take into account and make corrections for extinction in both our galaxy and the grb s host galaxy . galactic extinction ( @xmath10 )",
    "is corrected for using the values given by schlafly & finkbeiner ( 2011 ) as listed in table ( [ data ] ) .",
    "we transform the value of @xmath10 to @xmath11 by applying an average extinction law ( cardelli et al .",
    "grb 110625a is located in a region with very high extinction , @xmath12 ( schlafly & finkbeiner 2011 ) , making it difficult to give any constraints on the lf based on this burst , which was therefore excluded from our non - detection sample . for the host galaxy extinction",
    ", we adopt a mean value of @xmath13 ( kann et al .",
    "we did not consider the uncertainties involved in assuming a mean @xmath14 , including the effects of redshift and the change of attenuation law , since it is difficult to quantify the exact values of these effects .",
    "finally , we corrected the flux from the observer frame to the cosmological rest frame with @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the flux in the observer frame .",
    "the parameter @xmath17 is defined by @xmath18 ( with the convention @xmath19 ) , where we adopted the spectral index @xmath20 and power - law index @xmath21 for the light curves of the optical afterglows .",
    "we list basic properties of the grbs , namely the start and end observed time ( @xmath22 & @xmath23 ) , coordinates ( r.a . &",

    "it is , however , difficult to determine the value of @xmath33 ; in the particular case of our study , the k - s test helps eliminate this parameter when finding the best fits , by normalizing the cumulative flux distribution of grbs .",
    "an internal shock could produce the emission at the prompt phase and an external shock ( reverse shock / forward shock ) is thought to be a good candidate for the emission in the afterglow phase .",
    "however , the physical reason for the curved lf remains unclear .",
    "kann et al . ( 2010 ) interpreted the three - gaussian luminosity distribution as the existence of three `` classes '' of grbs .",
    "it might be possible that the emission at 100s in our work originates from internal processes since they are earlier than those from the afterglow phase .",
    "the optical luminosity was found to increase with increasing prompt energy release ( nysewander et al .",
    "2009 , kann et al . 2010 ) , similarly to the x - ray luminosity ( e.g. , kouveliotou et al .",
    "2004 ; liang & zhang 2006 ; amati et al . 2007 ; gehrels et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the plot of the optical luminosity @xmath65 at 100s after the burst onset versus the isotropic energy @xmath66 radiated during the prompt phase of our sample is studied here to compare with previous work .",
    "there does not seem to be any trend of luminosity @xmath65 to energy @xmath66 in our sample , as shown in figure [ eisolo ] .",
    "the redshifts of grbs in our sample were taken from jochen greiner s tablejcg / grbgen.html ] .",
    "for grb 110726a , the redshift of 1.036 is based on the only detected absorption line , whereas the upper limit of 2.7 is based on the non - detection of lyman alpha ; we adopt @xmath67 as its redshift .",
    "for the bursts without redshift measurements ( 21 grbs in our sample ) , we assume redshifts of @xmath68 for the calculation of the luminosity distance of the bursts since the mean redshift of swift grbs has been shown to be close to 2 ( e.g. , fynbo et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the isotropic bolometric energies @xmath69 released during the prompt phase of some grbs in our sample have been calculated by kann et al .",
    "( 2010 , 2011 ) .",
    "for the bursts not included in the work of kann et al .",
    "( 2010 , 2011 ) , we calculated the values @xmath69 based on butler s analysis ( butler et al .",
    "2007 ) and the gcn report .",
    "rapid follow - up observations in the optical are critical to understand the physical processes of grbs .",
    "there are quite a few small robotic telescopes , in addition to rotse - iii , that have been built and installed around the world in order to rapidly search for grb optical counterparts , e.g. , grocse ( park et al .",
    "1997 ) , tarot ( klotz et al .",

    "2005 ) , raptor ( vestrand et al . 2002 ) , rem ( zerbi & rem team 2001 ) , and watcher ( ferrero et al .",
    "2010 ) . with their large field of view ( fov ) and",
    "fast slewing abilities , these telescopes offer promise to capture large samples of optical counterparts to accurately constrain the grb lf at the earliest epoch after burst onset .",
