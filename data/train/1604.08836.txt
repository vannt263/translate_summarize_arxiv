    "the discovery of @xmath10 has opened a new era in hadron physics  @xcite . since then more than two dozen of the so - called exotic @xmath11 particles with hidden heavy - quark flavors",
    "have been observed in the past decade  @xcite , see refs .",
    "@xcite for recent experimental and theoretical reviews respectively .",
    "a common and interesting feature shared by these exotic states is that many of them lie close to the underlying thresholds composed of the open heavy - flavor states .",
    "then one important question is whether these newly observed @xmath11 peaks from experimental analyses correspond to the genuine or elementary resonance states , or the nearby threshold effects , or even the mixture of the previous two mechanisms .",
    "many different methods have been proposed to discern the inner structures of the hadronic states , including the compositeness coefficient analyses  @xcite , the qcd sum rule study  @xcite , the @xmath12 trajectories of the resonance poles  @xcite , and the pole counting rule  @xcite . in the present work",
    ", we shall apply the latter approach to study the @xmath0 , which was first observed by besiii collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the charged charmoniumlike state @xmath0 , with mass @xmath13  mev and width @xmath14 , has been observed in the @xmath15 invariant mass spectrum in @xmath16 process by besiii collaboration  @xcite in 2013 .",
    "it has been confirmed by the belle  @xcite and cleo@xcite collaborations in @xmath16 as well .",
    "later on a peak structure with mass @xmath17  mev and width @xmath18  mev , was observed in the @xmath19 invariant mass spectrum in the @xmath20 process  @xcite . the angular distribution analysis on the @xmath21 system in the @xmath22 channel given in ref .",
    "@xcite determines the quantum number of @xmath9 to be @xmath23 .",
    "regarding the nature of @xmath0 , it is very interesting in the theoretical aspect , ifn the sense that at the quark level it can be accommodated only by a @xmath24 plus a light quark - antiquark pair assignment and can not be the conventional @xmath24 charmonium .",
    "if these quarks are bounded together by color confining force then @xmath0 would be the compact tetraquark state  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , due to the fact that the mass of @xmath0 is very close to the @xmath25 threshold , it provides a natural candidate as a @xmath8 molecule  @xcite .",
    "in addition there also exist other possible explanations , such as the cusp effects suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite , and the anomalous triangle singularity in refs .",
    "@xcite . a recent lattice investigation in ref .",
    "@xcite gives a small negative scattering length in the corresponding channel ( repulsive interaction ) , hence in disfavor of a resonant picture .",
    "but one should be cautious when interpreting the lattice result with the physical measurements , since the lightest pion mass used in the previous lattice study is 300  mev , still much larger than its physical value .",
    "efforts have also been made in the literature  @xcite in an attempt to distinguish between the molecule picture and the tetraquark one , by estimating the decay width of @xmath0 . in ref .",
    "@xcite the @xmath0 in the photoproduction process @xmath26 is studied .    in this work the so - called pole counting rule , which was developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , shall be used in discriminating the nature of @xmath27 .",
    "this rule provides an elegant way to distinguish the mechanisms of generating resonances around the threshold by counting the number of nearby poles of the amplitudes in the complex energy plane . through the study of the potential scattering with and without the castillejo - dalitz - dyson pole",
    ", it concludes that for the molecular type of resonance there is just one corresponding pole , while for the elementary type of resonance there is a pair of poles lying close to the threshold in the nearby unphysical riemann sheets .",
    "though this rule is not asserted as a mathematical theorem , it is most likely to hold in the physical regimes  @xcite . in order to apply this rule , a precisely determined amplitude is clearly crucial , and it also implies that the final conclusion from this approach relies heavily on the input experimental data .",
    "this is one of the reasons that we try to fit as many available data as possible to better constrain the amplitude .    in this respect",
    ", we should mention that the very recent works in refs .",
    "@xcite have also analyzed the @xmath8 and @xmath1 invariant mass distributions by emphasizing the nonperturbative nature of the @xmath25 interactions around the @xmath27 energy region .",
    "however we point out that in addition to the @xmath28 resummation mechanism to include a bare @xmath27 field through the breit - wigner or flatt functions   is another possibility to fit the data . naively speaking",
    ", the two mechanisms correspond to rather different scenarios for @xmath27 .",
    "if @xmath27 is originated from the @xmath8 resummation , it has a good chance to be a @xmath8 molecular , while if it is an elementary state with @xmath8 playing only a minor role in its composition , it can be easily described by the flatt function .",
    "it should be emphasized that a near - threshold pole location does not necessarily imply a molecular structure .",
    "a good example is the @xmath10 resonance  @xcite .",
    "a flatt - type function fit with and explicit resonance exchange gives an excellent description to the data and pairs of poles are found in nearby riemann sheets .",
    "regarding @xmath27 , it is a priori not known which approach gives better description of the data : the @xmath8 resummation or the explicit resonance exchange .",
    "one of the novelties in the present work is to include both of the approaches to fit the data .",
    "moreover , instead of simply parameterizing the @xmath8 interactions with @xmath29 , @xmath30 and other light - flavor mesons with constant or polynomial three - momentum terms  @xcite , we describe all the interactions by constructing the pertinent effective lagrangians and seriously take care of the resummation of @xmath8 by distinguishing the transverse and longitudinal parts of the vector mesons . a simultaneous description of the @xmath4 and @xmath2 invariant mass distributions , in addition to the @xmath8 and @xmath1 ones , will be discussed .",
    "a comparison between different scenarios realized by switching on and off different parameters is made , the pole counting method established in ref .",
    "@xcite is then applied and we reach a solid conclusion that @xmath0 is of a molecule nature .",

    "assuming that @xmath0 is an @xmath32 particle , we construct the effective lagrangian to describe the interactions between @xmath0 and other particles . here",
    "we use the conventional proca vector representation to incorporate the vector and axial - vector states @xmath29 and @xmath0 , denoted by @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively , while in ref .  @xcite the antisymmetric tensor formalism is employed . in the molecular picture ,",
    "the nonperturbative @xmath8 interaction is responsible for the near - threshold state @xmath27 .",
    "the one - pion exchange contribution in the open heavy - flavor meson - meson scattering is still under debate , as discussed in ref .",
    "there is evidence that the pion - exchange contribution is a subleading effect in the heavy - flavor meson - meson ( @xmath35 ) scattering .",
    "for example , a perturbative nature of the pion exchange is established based on the power counting scheme of the effective field theory in ref .",
    "@xcite . especially it is obtained that the expansion energy scale for the isovector case increases by a factor of 3 compared to the isoscalar one , implying a more perturbative nature of the @xmath25 scattering in the @xmath9 channel than that in the @xmath10 case .",
    "this fact is further supported by explicit calculations , which show that the light @xmath36 meson exchanges indeed play a minor role in the @xmath6 scattering  @xcite .",
    "based on this argument , we will consider only the local contact @xmath6 interaction in this work .",

    "it is remarkable that the two seemingly very different approaches point to the same conclusion : @xmath0 is a @xmath67 molecule . as we have already emphasized that this conclusion is not trivial , considering the near threshold @xmath10 resonance as a counterexample .",

    "the @xmath208 state was observed by the lhcb collaboration in the @xmath209 channel in the @xmath210 process . since",
    "a proton is made of @xmath211 , the former process is very similar to the one under investigation if one replaces a @xmath212 pair inside the proton by a @xmath213 which are of same quantum number .",
