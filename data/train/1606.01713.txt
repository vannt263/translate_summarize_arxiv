    "our general model is defined in terms of dynamical moves of `` particles '' ( vesicles ) each carrying a chemical species , denoted as @xmath0 , in a 1-dimensional ( 1d ) system for convenience represented as a 1d lattice with @xmath1 sites .",
    "this could describe the endosomal and secretory pathways where the primary transport , barring a few branching events , is along 1d .",
    "however for definiteness , we will henceforth use the terminology of the secretory pathway .",
    "the model allows for ( i ) influx of unprocessed cargo at the left ( er ) in the form of injection of a particles , ( ii ) outflux of processed molecules at the right ( pm ) , i.e. , exit of particles from the right boundary , ( iii ) recycling of particles back to the er , i.e. , exit of particles from the left , ( iv ) fusion of particles to form an aggregate and fusion to a preexisting aggregate , ( v ) fission from an aggregate , ( vi ) transport within the system either via single particle movement ( vesicle exchange ) and/or collective movement of the entire aggregate of particles ( cisternal movement ) , and finally , ( vii ) chemical transformation or processing of molecules in the aggregates , via the sequential interconversion @xmath2 of particles . for further details ,",
    "see _ supplementary information _ ( also schematic in fig.[fig1 m ] ) .",
    "directional transport is modeled via asymmetric anterograde / retrograde particle movement rates , with @xmath3 , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 parametrizes the asymmetry for a particles and so on ( fig.[fig1 m ] ) .",
    "this asymmetry factor could depend on the activity of gtpases such as cdc42 @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the asymmetry factors @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 on the chemical species corresponds to differential degrees of recycling of @xmath0 particles to the er .    the rates of fission - fusion and chemical conversion depend on the amount ( or `` mass '' ) of chemical species in the donor ( @xmath8 ) and acceptor ( @xmath9 ) aggregates , through the flux - kernel , @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "there are many choices of the flux - kernel ( see _ si _ for a discussion ) , but the form that we explore in detail is independent of the mass of the acceptor aggregate : @xmath11=\\frac{k_{sat}m_i^{\\theta}}{m_i^{\\theta}+m^{\\theta}_{sat } } , \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\ , 0 \\leq \\theta \\leq 1   \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] and corresponds to michelis - menten ( mm ) type of enzymatic kinetics for fission or chemical conversion , where we choose @xmath12 .",
    "is based on the realization that our effective 1d model is obtained by integrating over the two directions perpendicular to the cis to trans axis in the golgi , and assuming that only the perimeter molecules participate in the flux . ]",
    "thus , reaction rates increase as @xmath13 , @xmath14 for small amounts of @xmath15 , @xmath16 in the parent aggregate , but become enzyme - limited and saturate to a constant value @xmath17 when the amount of @xmath15 , @xmath16 exceeds @xmath18 . in principle",
    ", the saturation scale @xmath18 can be different for fission and conversion processes , but to keep the model analytically tractable ( using techniques developed in @xcite ) , we restrict it to be the same for both .",
    "we have also studied flux - kernels which depend on the amount of the chemical species in the acceptor aggregate , and find that this does does not qualitatively change the results ( see si ) .",
    "note that chemical interconversion in our model is a highly simplified representation of the sequential processing of proteins as they pass through the golgi @xcite . instead of explicitly incorporating the enzymes responsible for various biochemical modifications , we treat these modifications as simple poisson processes occurring with specified rates , as in @xcite .",
    "the rates should thus be viewed as effective or composite parameters . despite its simplicity",
    ", we believe that this qualitatively captures the role of the interconversion process in shaping the macro organization of the golgi .    the transport and chemical interconversion rules described above , can also be re - expressed as dynamical equations for the average `` mass '' of each chemical species at each site . under suitable conditions",
    ", these equations can be solved to obtain the spatial profiles of the mass ( abundance ) of each species in steady state . from these profiles",
    "will emerge features such as ` compartments ' , for which we provide a precise definition below .",
    "given the finite spatiotemporal resolution of coarse - grained models , one needs to provide a consistent definition of a compartment , an aspect that is also pertinent for in - vivo imaging of golgi compartments .",
    "as we will see , this is particularly germane to the vt model and its variants .    to identify self - organized compartments we locate the maxima ( concentration peaks ) in the spatial profile of the total mass and note the locations on either side of the maximum where the mass drops to half its peak value .",
    "this half - width around maximum is taken to be the compartment size ( and can span many lattice sites ) while the sites between adjacent compartments constitute intercisternal regions . while defining dynamical moves ( fig.[fig1 m ] ) , however , we represent cisternal or sub - cisternal progression as the collective movement of the mass at a single site , rather than the movement of this many - site agglomerate .",
    "this leads to a consistent description in the cp limit where a compartment has a small width ( spanning 1 - 2 sites ) . in the vt limit , where a typical compartment can span many sites ( see fig.[fig2a1 ] ) , the breakage , movement and fusion of sub - cisternal fragments from site to site within the compartment can be viewed as an intra - compartment remodeling process which eventually leads to the budding of a large fragment from the anterograde face of the compartment and its fusion with the next compartment .",
    "distances are shown in terms of the position variable @xmath19 , which is scaled by @xmath1 , the distance between the cis and trans end .",
    "masses are defined as multiples of the unit mass , which is the typical mass of a vesicle or ` particle ' breaking off from a cisterna ( see fig.[fig1 m ] ) . a time unit ( t.u . )",
    "is chosen such that the injection rate @xmath20 is @xmath21 vesicle / t.u ..     +",
    "we now demonstrate how the interplay of various dynamical processes in the model gives rise to steady states configurations that mirror the spatial organization of the golgi cisternae .",
    "we first consider the two extreme limits of the model the _ pure vt _ and the _ pure cp _ limits , and then explore variants around these limiting cases , with the aim of modeling ` mixed ' traffic strategies .      the pure vesicular transport ( vt ) model is obtained by setting the aggregate movement rate @xmath22 .",
    "this allows us to solve for the average mass of each species at each site in steady state , using the techniques described in @xcite ( see si for details ) .",
    "while we have explored several functional forms of @xmath23 $ ] using numerical simulations ( si ) , we discuss below properties of structures generated using eq.[eq1 ] .",
    "an example of compartment emergence in the pure vt limit for the three - species model with @xmath24 conversion , is depicted in fig.[fig2a1 ] .",
    "a typical snapshot shows that while @xmath15 particles accumulate close to the cis end , @xmath16 and @xmath25 particles form distinct compartments in the interior .",
    "similarly , the four - species model exhibits steady states with a particles near the cis end and distinct b , c and d structures in the interior ( see si ) .",
    "self - organization of compartments in the pure vt limit is driven by three main effects , which we discuss below .",
    "[ [ a. ] ] a. + +    * spatial organization of compartments*. the spatial segregation of chemical species and their localization in different regions , depends on ( i ) the ratio of chemical conversion rate to fission rates , @xmath26 , and ( ii ) the degree of directional bias in transport .",
    "if the ratio @xmath27 is very large , most a particles undergo an @xmath28 conversion before they can travel into the interior , leading to an accumulation of b particles close to the source itself .",
    "conversely , if @xmath29 , b particles localize away from the source .",
    "the length scale governing the localization of c particles depends likewise on the ratio @xmath30 .",
    "the second determinant of the region of localization is the directional bias @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7  particles with greater recycling to the source localize closer to the cis end , while those with less recycling form structures near the trans end .",
    "thus , if the directional bias factors @xmath6 and @xmath7 are unequal , and the ratios @xmath27 and @xmath30 sufficiently different , the peak concentration of @xmath31 occur at well - separated locations .    [ [ b. ] ] b. + +    * morphologically distinct compartments*. spatially localized particles of a particular species form a large , morphologically distinct aggregate only if the flux - kernel @xmath23 $ ] attains a constant value at large @xmath32 ( as in eq.[eq1 ] ) , i.e. , the outflux of vesicles from any aggregate saturates as aggregate size increases .    sharp localization of b , c particles in different regions ( as opposed to gentle gradients ) is the key to obtaining spatially resolvable cisternae - like structures . to see how flux - kernels that saturate at large @xmath32 lead to sharp localization , consider how the structures in fig.[fig2a1 ] respond to a small increase in influx .",
    "an increase in influx increases the particle concentration or mass @xmath32 in all regions of the system , which in turn causes the vesicular outflux ( proportional to @xmath23 $ ] ) to rise until a new flux balance is achieved . however , in regions of peak concentration , where @xmath33 and the vesicular outflux @xmath23 $ ] is already in the saturation regime , the mass has to increase substantially in order to achieve the small increase in vesicular outflux required for steady state .",
    "conversely , in the intercisternal regions , where @xmath32 is small and @xmath23 $ ] is not in the saturation regime , a modest increase in mass is enough to achieve the requisite increase in vesicular outflux .",
    "thus , with saturating flux kernels @xmath23 $ ] of the type in eq.[eq1 ] , the contrast in particle concentration between cisternal and intercisternal regions is naturally amplified when influx is high , leading to the emergence of sharply localized and well - defined compartments in fact , if the influx is too high , the vesicular outflux may fail to balance the influx near the peaks , leading to runaway growth of mass , as elaborated in @xcite ( also pointed out in @xcite ) .",
    "the key to generating large but finite concentrations of a , b , c particles in specific regions , is to tune the influx rate @xmath20 such that the system is in steady state , but _ poised close to the transition point _ to runaway growth .",
    "this causes the peaks in the average mass profile to become very sharp .",
    "[ [ c. ] ] c. + +    * robustness of compartments*. there is a trade - off between the temporal stability of a compartment and how sharply localized it is ; this can be optimized with a flux - kernel @xmath23 $ ] that increases for small @xmath32 but saturates at large @xmath32 ( as in eq.[eq1 ] ) .",
    "stability of structures can be quantified using the ratio of the root mean square ( rms ) fluctuations @xmath34 to the mean mass @xmath35 at any location .",
    "we measure this ratio for different functional forms of @xmath23 $ ] in our simulations ( details in si ) , and find that aggregates are stable ( @xmath36 for large @xmath35 ) , if the fission rate and hence the flux - kernel @xmath23 $ ] increases with @xmath32 .",
    "this ensures a stabilizing negative feedback when the aggregate becomes too large , the number of particles breaking off from it increases and vice versa , thus restoring the aggregate to its average size .",
    "however , as discussed above , sharply localized a , b , c compartments emerge only if vesicular fluxes are relatively insensitive to aggregate size , i.e. , for @xmath23 $ ] that saturates at large @xmath32 .",
    "the best compromise between the competing requirements of stability and sharp localization is obtained with mm ( or qualitatively similar ) fission rates , as in eq.[eq1 ] .",
    "thus , spatially and chemically distinct compartments emerge in the pure vt limit , even in the _ absence of a pre - existing template _ if the three conditions above are satisfied ( for a more rigorous discussion of the conditions , see si ) .",
    "a limitation of this mode of self - organization is that it requires _ fine tuning _ of parameters , and that structures may even undergo an instability , leading to runaway growth , in certain regions of parameter space .",
    "however , this instability is suppressed if we allow for a mixed transport strategy , in which vesicular transport is accompanied by rare sub - cisternal movement ( see below ) .",
    "the cisternal progression and maturation ( cp ) limit , obtained by setting @xmath37 and @xmath38 , allows for anterograde movement of full aggregates at rate @xmath39 ( with aggregates fusing on encounter to form larger aggregates ) , in addition to the sequential @xmath40 conversion of particles within each aggregate .",
    "this system self - organizes into a state where the entire mass is concentrated in a relatively small number ( @xmath41 ) of aggregates ( see figs.[fig2b1 ] ) .",
    "the typical mass of an aggregate increases with increasing distance @xmath19 from the ( er ) source , while the probability of finding an aggregate decreases with @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "thus , compartments become larger but sparser from cis to trans .",
    "the emergence of morphologically separate structures is a generic feature of this model , and occurs _ without any fine tuning _ , because of the tendency of large moving aggregates to sweep up all the mass in their vicinity .",
    "the sequential conversions further cause the system to develop biochemical polarity , with the composition of aggregates showing a gentle gradation from a - rich to b - rich to c - rich in the cis to trans direction .",
    "the length scales governing these chemical gradients depend on the interconversion rates and the function @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "system - wide gradients emerge for @xmath42 , i.e. , for conversion rates that are much smaller than the rate of cisternal movement .",
    "a distinguishing feature of structure formation in the cp limit is the occurrence of a large number of mixed ( two - color ) compartments ( figs.[fig2b1 ] ) .",
    "the movement of large aggregates through the system also results in distinctive dynamical properties : the total mass in the system undergoes _ intermittent _ time evolution @xcite .",
    "we discuss later how this can be a revealing signature of cisternal passage .",
    "most of these qualitative features of structure formation by cp appear robust upon changing transport rules , e.g. , by making the aggregate movement rate @xmath39 mass or chemistry dependent .",
    "while multiple , spatially and chemically distinct compartments emerge in both pure vt and cp models , there are significant differences between structures in the two limits that we discuss below .",
    "first , structures generated in the pure vt model ( with mm rates ) are _ stable _ ( position , size and composition vary little over time ) , though highly sensitive to changes in the rates of underlying processes .",
    "by contrast , in the pure cp model , structures are highly _ dynamic _ , with their positions , composition and even number showing significant variation over time .",
    "monitoring the extent of variability of features such as the number of cisternae and the fluctuations in fluorescence from specific golgi regions over time ( see next section ) using live - cell imaging could thus provide valuable clues to the mechanism of transport ( to a limited extent this has been done in @xcite ) .",
    "second , while interconnected cisternae are observed in the vt limit ( fig.[fig2a1 ] , also figs .",
    "4(e)-4(f ) of si ) , whereas more discrete cisternae ( with little or no mass in the intercisternal regions ) arise in the cp limit ( fig.[fig2b1 ] ) . while the exact nature of this prediction may hinge on specifics of the model , the observation points towards an interesting correlation between the presence of inter - cisternal tubulation and the mode of intra - golgi traffic .",
    "finally , the two limits also differ in the degree of spatial localization of individual chemical species . in the vt model ,",
    "each species is _ sharply localized _ and not spread over multiple compartments ( figs .",
    "[ fig2a1 ] ) . in the cp model , a typical snapshot ( figs .",
    "[ fig2b1 ] ) reveals many aggregates of mixed composition , with the relative abundance of each species exhibiting a gentle gradient across aggregates in the cis to trans direction .",
    "this distinction is fairly robust , suggesting possible experimental strategies aimed at exploring the connection between transport mechanisms and the spatial localization / delocalization of enzymes and markers , a connection that was also highlighted in @xcite .",
    "we now consider ` mixed ' strategies of transport , which involve features of both the vt and the cp models to different extents @xcite .",
    "since the parameter space is very large , we study only small deviations from either limit .",
    "this is also important from a stability perspective , since a mechanism for maintaining differentiated compartments must be robust to small variations in the model .    [",
    "[ cisternal - progenitor - as - a - small - deviation - about - pure - vesicular - transport . ] ] cisternal progenitor as a small deviation about pure vesicular transport .",

    "this instability is ameliorated by allowing fragments of cisternae ( containing a _ finite fraction _",
    "@xmath43 of cisternal mass ) to bud off , move through the system and fuse with other compartments , as in the cisternal progenitor model @xcite .",
    "in fact , using flux balance arguments , we can show that the inclusion of sub - cisternal movement at any _ non - zero _ rate @xmath39 is sufficient to eliminate runaway growth , and ensure that aggregates always attain a constant average mass even under substantial changes in the rates of transport processes ( see si ) .",
    "moreover , if the flux of cisternal fragments is much lower than vesicular fluxes between cisternae , then the well - separated @xmath16 and @xmath25 compartments typical of the pure vt model are preserved on an average ( fig .",
    "[ fig3a1 ] ) .",
    "the movement of cisternal fragments does result in significant stochastic fluctuations ( @xmath44 ) about the average mass profile over time scales proportional to @xmath45 .",
    "these fluctuations , are however , small as long as @xmath43 is small .",
    "thus , the addition of a cisternal - progenitor - like process at a small rate to vesicular transport appears to be a very reliable control mechanism , meeting all the desiderata of organelle morphogenesis . in the rest of the paper",

    "large aggregates form close to the cis end but disintegrate into smaller fragments near the trans end , giving rise to configurations ( fig .",
    "[ fig3b1 ] ) that bear a striking resemblance to the usual picture of cisternal progression . in the rest of the paper",
    ", we refer to this scenario as the _ cp - dominated _ case .",
    "our analysis of mixed transport scenarios suggests that these are viable mechanisms for the formation and maintenance of differentiated cisternae , as long as one of the transport processes ( vesicular or cisternal movement ) is dominant , and the alternative process acts at a much smaller rate as a secondary track for traffic .",
    "if both processes occur with comparable rates , then large structures tend to dissipate , and the system homogenizes .",
    "below we discuss how experimental approaches that monitor dynamics of the golgi in steady state or dynamics of recovery following perturbations from steady state , can be used to discriminate between various models .",
    "a dynamics - based approach was also explored in @xcite , where the temporal pattern of fluorescence decay in ifrap experiments was used to test several hypotheses about molecular trafficking in the golgi ( see @xcite for a quantitative analysis , also si ) . here",
    ", we propose several novel dynamical measurements that can provide a window into traffic processes .",
    "distinctive signatures of the underlying traffic mechanism can be observed in the time series and fluctuation statistics of the `` mass '' @xmath50 in ( any ) macroscopic region @xmath51 of the system .",

    "we find that @xmath59 diverges as @xmath60 for all the three cases - pure cp , cp - dominated , vt - dominated - in which there is appreciable cisternal or sub - cisternal movement , but remains ` flat ' in the pure vt case ( fig.[fig4e ] ) . to further distinguish between the cp - dominated and vt - dominated scenarios , we monitor the _ timescale _ over which flatness diverges this is just the typical time period between successive cisternal passage events , and is much larger for the vt - dominated limit , as compared to the cp - dominated limits ( fig .",
    "[ fig4e ] ) .",
    "more generally , if the frequency of cisternal passage events ( as inferred from flatness measurements ) is consistent with the observed rates of cargo transit , then this points towards a cisterna - dominated mode of traffic , whereas if the frequency is much less , then this would suggest that cisternal movement is only a secondary transport mechanism .",
    "+     +     +    statistics such as flatness can be extracted by monitoring the time series of fluorescence intensity of golgi markers , and should be accessible in recent dynamical measurements at sub - golgi resolution @xcite .",
    "it may also be instructive to do this measurement separately for the cis , medial and trans regions of the golgi , to test whether intensity fluctuations from cis and medial golgi have qualitatively different statistics compared to fluctuations from the trans golgi , where transport is dominated by vesicles and fragments of the disintegrating cisterna .      to study the dynamics of de novo biogenesis , we start with an initial condition in which the system is completely empty ( corresponding to resorption of cargo molecules and golgi - resident enzymes into the er , for instance after brefeldin treatment )",
    ". we then restart all the elementary processes that define the dynamics of the model ( this corresponds to a washout of brefeldin in regeneration experiments @xcite ) , at the chosen rates , and monitor how the @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath25 mass profiles recover in time @xmath53 .",
    "our simulations show that these profiles evolve quite differently , depending on whether vesicular or cisternal movement is the dominant mode of transport ( movies ( s5)-(s6 ) ) .",
    "a clear signature of the transport process appears in the region - wise compositional ` entropy ' , defined as : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the mass of species @xmath63 in the region @xmath51 , and @xmath64 .",

    "near the trans end , maturation has the opposite effect , shifting the composition of aggregates from bc towards pure c and reducing the entropy .",
    "but this is countered by the entry of mixed bc compartments and exit of concentrated c compartments , resulting in a net increase in compositional entropy even in the trans compartments , on average .",
    "thus , @xmath66 rises during de novo formation with cp due to the generation and movement of _ mixed _ compartments .",

    "however , the increase in the number of parameters also makes it difficult to analyze such an extended model and extract the relevant regions of parameter space .",
    "an abstract model of the sort studied in this paper , is more suited to gain insight into the qualitative effects at play in the system . at a philosophical level ,",
    "our work touches upon the question of whether and how the golgi can form de novo ( for example , after treatment with reagents that cause golgi cisternae to disintegrate ) .",
    "we show that a system with `` golgi - like traffic processes '' has the ability to self - organize into morphological and chemically distinct structures that share many qualitative features of golgi cisternae .",

    "this and many of our mathematically derived conclusions find resonance in ideas articulated before , especially in @xcite .",
    "an important conclusion of our analysis is that the transport mechanism can qualitatively impact structural features of the cisternae such as inter - cisternal tubulations or the degree of localization of golgi - resident enzymes",
    ". such correlations between transport and morphology could be explored by doing a comparative study across different cells .",

    "the 1d model can thus be considered an effective model obtained by integrating over the two directions perpendicular to this cis to trans direction . however , a 1d model of this sort can not address questions related to the shape of individual cisternae or if trafficking pathways are branched .",

    "likewise , an aggregate which is primarily of type @xmath16 is analogous to a cisterna with a large fraction of semi - processed molecules in an early stage of processing .",

    "this kind of a detailed enzyme plus cargo model would allow us to model feedbacks wherein the distribution of @xmath16 particles influences the distribution of the corresponding @xmath98 enzymes , and is in turn influenced by @xmath98 molecules which activate the @xmath79 conversion .",
    "thus , in general , we expect self - organization in this extended model to be more complex .",
    "nevertheless , the effective rate - based model studied in this paper incorporates the sequential interconversion process using just a few parameters , and has the advantage that it is more amenable to analysis than a complex model .",

    "similarly , the @xmath79 modification rate is determined jointly by the rates of attachment and detachment of enzyme molecules with b molecules , the concentration of the enzyme molecules , the reaction rate between the enzyme and the b molecule etc . .",
