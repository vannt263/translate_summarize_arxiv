    "@xcite recently reported the detection of a giant planet in star system hd 188753 .",
    "the planet orbits a sun - like star every 3.35 days and has roughly the mass of jupiter .",
    "although this orbit is extremely tight , it is unremarkable among @xmath030 known `` hot jupiters '' with periods of 2.510 days around solitary stars .",
    "what distinguishes the new discovery is that the planetary host star ( a ) is bound to a companion ( b ) that is itself a compact binary ; hd 188753 is thus a hierarchical triple star .",
    "star a has a mass of @xmath1 , and binary star b has constituent masses of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "orbit ab has a semimajor axis of @xmath4 and an eccentricity of @xmath5 , and b has parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 . while the notion of a planet in a triple star is quite provocative",
    ", the most fascinating aspect of hd 188753 is the close orbit of ab , which seems to challenge existing models of giant - planet formation .    planets form in a disk of gas and dust surrounding a nascent star .",
    "two theories exist for the genesis of jovian planets ( see bodenheimer & lin 2002 and references therein ) . in the core - accretion paradigm , a solid core of @xmath010 earth masses forms at disk radii of @xmath823au , where the temperature is low enough for ices to condense .",
    "the core then accretes a gaseous envelope .",
    "the alternative picture involves the gravitational fragmentation of the disk into gaseous protoplanets at radii of @xmath0510au .",
    "when addressing hot jupiters , each theory requires some mechanism to drive the migration of the planet to small radii ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "complexities and uncertainties inherent in these two models are exacerbated when the young star is in a binary .",
    "the perturbing gravitational field of the binary companion acts to ( 1 ) tidally truncate the disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and ( 2 ) stir and heat the disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". a disk truncation radius of @xmath93au may preclude the embryonic stage in the core - accretion scenario @xcite .",
    "even if the truncation radius is @xmath010au , the disk may be too hot to allow either core formation or unstable gravitational collapse @xcite .",
    "the source of the conundrum in hd 188753 is that the orbital parameters of ab imply that a disk around star a would be truncated at a radius of only @xmath01au .",
    "it seems very unlikely that a giant planet could have grown in such an environment .",
    "however , this dilemma can be avoided if we abandon the tacit assumption that the system has maintained its current configuration since the time when the stars and planet formed .",
    "suppose that star a and the planet have always been paired , and that the planet was allowed to form by one of the two models sketched above and then migrate to small radii .",
    "it follows that , at the time of planet formation , star a was either single or in a much wider binary than at present .",
    "the simplest way to transform either of these states into hd 188753 is via a strong dynamical interaction , such as a scattering encounter between a single and a triple star , or two binaries .",
    "this could only have occurred in a moderately dense stellar environment .",
    "different modes of multiple - star formation and probabilistic arguments regarding the birthplace of hd 188753 are discussed in   [ sec : cluster ] .",
    "three plausible dynamical histories for hd 188753 are introduced in   [ sec : dynamics ] . in   [ sec : numerical ] , numerical scattering experiments are used to gauge the likelihood of each scenario",
    ". the broader relevance of this work is given in ",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "stars rarely form in isolation , and so it is quite likely that hd 188753 was born in some flavor of stellar system , either a loose , transient group of stars or a bona fide open cluster .",
    "the salient features of groups and open clusters are listed below ( see adams & myers 2001 for a thorough discussion ) .",
    "once the relevant kinematical parameters are in hand , it is a simple matter to assess the most probable environmental conditions for a dynamical origin of hd 188753 .",
    "most stars are born in small groups with @xmath10@xmath11 members , stellar densities of @xmath12 , velocity dispersions of @xmath13 , and evaporation time scales of @xmath14 .",
    "there is insufficient data on these short - lived groups to develop a reliable statistical picture of their properties and stellar content .",
    "roughly 10% of all stars form in larger systems ( @xmath15@xmath16 ) that would rightfully be called open clusters , for which there is a wealth of observational data .",
    "open clusters tend to have higher densities and somewhat higher velocity dispersions than groups , and have longer lifetimes .",
    "while some clusters are as old as @xmath17@xmath18 , the median age is @xmath17@xmath19 .",
    "all but a few percent of open clusters dissolve in @xmath20@xmath21 , due to the dynamical effects of internal evolution , the galactic tidal field , and close passages by molecular clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in open clusters that have been surveyed for stellar multiplicity ,",
    "the estimated binary fraction is @xmath1750% ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "although few triples are known in clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the expected fraction is @xmath17510% , based on the statistics of field stars near the sun ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a dynamical interaction capable of producing hd 188753 involves at least one binary ( or hierarchical triple ) with an orbital separation of @xmath22 ( see   [ sec : dynamics ] ) .",
    "a binary of this size can be strongly perturbed by a third star if the distance of closest approach between the star and binary center of mass is @xmath9@xmath23 . for stellar speeds of @xmath24",
    ", we see that @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , the close - encounter cross section is dominated by gravitational focusing and takes the characteristic value @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the total mass of the few - body system .",
    "the probability that the binary has such an interaction in the lifetime of the stellar system is @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .",
    "suppose that the number of similar binaries in any stellar system is a fixed fraction of the total number of stars . the net probability for a strong few - body interaction to occur in a given system",
    "would then scale as @xmath34 .",
    "a typical open cluster has @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , making the characteristic value of @xmath34 for a cluster @xmath17100 times larger than for a smaller group .",
    "even when we multiply by the additional factor of 0.1 , the fraction of stars formed in open clusters , it is still very probable that hd 188753 originated in a system with @xmath17@xmath37 stars that lived for @xmath8@xmath19 and has long since evaporated .",
    "it may seem a daunting task to investigate all possible ways of forming hd 188753 in a cluster rich in multiple - star systems .",
    "however , three distinct scenarios stand out as being the most likely ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dynillus ] for graphical depictions ) : ( i ) hierarchy ab existed at the time of planet formation , but with a much larger periastron separation , which was subsequently reduced to its present value in a strong encounter with a single star ; ( ii ) star a was born with a different , single companion in a wide orbit that was later exchanged for binary star b ; ( iii ) star a was initially single before being exchanged into a pre - existing hierarchical triple containing b. each channel involves a catalyst star ( c ) that ultimately escapes . in all of these interactions ,",
    "the finite sizes of the planetary orbit , binary b , and star c are neglected , an idea that is exploited in ",
    "[ sec : numerical ] .    in scenarios",
    "i and ii , star a is in a binary with b or c at the time of planet formation . the semimajor axis @xmath23 and eccentricity @xmath38 of this binary are constrained by the demand that the planet formed by the core - accretion process or gravitational collapse at a radius of @xmath83au in a disk around star a. @xcite estimate the disk truncation radius to be @xmath39 , where @xmath40 , a function of the stellar masses , decreases from @xmath0@xmath41 to @xmath0@xmath42 as the companion mass increases from @xmath43 to @xmath44 .",
    "it is not clear how large the disk and binary orbit must be to allow giant - planet formation to proceed much as it would around a single star .",
    "the simple constraint adopted in the numerical study of the next section is that @xmath45 , which implies that @xmath46 in scenarios i and ii .    in scenario iii , single star a encounters triple bc , where b , a tight binary with separation @xmath47 , orbits c with a semimajor axis of @xmath48 and an eccentricity of @xmath49 .",
    "it seems likely that bc will have long - term stability against disintegration , for which an approximate condition is @xcite @xmath50^{2/5}~,\\ ] ] where @xmath51 .",
    "when @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 , the stability condition is @xmath55@xmath56 for @xmath571 .",
    "note that scenario iii is much less constrained than i and ii .",
    "it is shown in the next section that scenario iii is the favored channel for producing hd 188753 .",
    "simulations have been conducted to demonstrate how effective each of the three scenarios is in producing hd 188753 . instead of following all 5 objects4 stars and 1 planet  the problem has been reduced to scattering encounters between binaries and single stars .",
    "this idealization is justified when no pair in the set @xmath58 comes sufficiently close to induce strong tidal perturbations .",
    "the adopted radii of the objects are the orbital separation of the planet from a ( @xmath59 ) , the semimajor axis of b ( @xmath60 ) , and the radius of a main - sequence star for c , approximated as @xmath61 .",
    "a scattering calculation is terminated if the separation of any pair is less than three times the sum of their radii ; the factor of three is a somewhat arbitrary , but conservative , choice . in practice",
    ", a minor fraction of the experiments end this way .",
    "initial conditions for the scattering encounters are generated by monte carlo methods from astrophysically motivated probability distributions .",
    "the orientations and orbital phases of the incident binaries are chosen as in @xcite .",
    "semimajor axes are drawn from a logarithmically flat distribution , @xmath62 ( @xmath63100au ) , inspired by binary statistics in the solar neighborhood ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a linear distribution , @xmath64 ( @xmath651 ) , is adopted for the initial eccentricities .",
    "impact parameters are distributed uniformly in @xmath66 , with a maximum value large enough to allow all outcomes of interest .",
    "relative speeds at infinity , @xmath67 , are picked from a maxwellian distribution , @xmath68 .",
    "there is no distribution of catalyst masses , @xmath69 , that is suitable for all three scenarios . as a concrete , but rather arbitrary , choice , @xmath69 is drawn from @xmath70 over the range of 0.2@xmath44 .",
    "once the parameters of the incident binary have been chosen , they are checked for consistency with a given scenario . in scenarios",
    "i and ii , @xmath45 must be satisfied ( by assumption ) for the incident binary containing a.",
    "scenario iii only requires that the incident triple is stable ( eq .  [ [ eq : tripstab ] ] ) .",
    "each system that passes this initial test is followed through the scattering interaction .",
    "the code used to automatically generate and terminate each encounter is similar in logic to that described in @xcite .",
    "the equations of motion are integrated with the time - transformed leapfrog algorithm of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "every time a bound pair ab is left as the final product of an experiment , the orbital parameters are recorded and the system is tested for triple stability ; unstable systems are cut .",
    "figure  [ fig : numerical ] shows the final results of these simulations .",
    "a total of @xmath71 scattering experiments were computed for each scenario .",
    "it is immediately apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig : numerical ] that scenarios i and ii have considerable difficulty in producing systems that resemble hd 188753 , while the corresponding efficiency for scenario iii is quite high . if the minimum disk truncation radius were reduced to , e.g. , 5au , scenarios i and ii would be somewhat more profitable . nonetheless , scenario iii is clearly the most robust of the three channels , simply because there are no special hurdles for jovian - planet formation .",
    "the obstacles to forming a giant planet in hd 188753 can be overcome if the triple originated in a moderately dense stellar system and has a nontrivial dynamical history .",
    "a similar picture might apply to other close binaries or triples that host a giant planet .",
    "three systems are noteworthy in this regard , each with an orbital separation of @xmath020au : @xmath72 cephei @xcite ; hd 41004 ( a triple containing a brown dwarf ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; gliese 86 ( has a white - dwarf secondary ; * ? ? ?",
    "all of these systems could threaten conventional theories of jovian - planet formation , but the compact orbits may have resulted from exchange encounters or other types of strong dynamical interactions in a stellar group or open cluster .",
    "stellar dynamics can play critical roles in the planet - formation process and in generating variety among single , binary , and triple stars that host planets .",
    "more than half of all field stars are in binaries and higher - order multiples , and most of these stars are born in systems with @xmath810 members .",
    "thus , it can be argued that stellar dynamical considerations are fundamental to a complete understanding of how planets are created and evolve dynamically , and in deciding how to search for these worlds .",
    "earlier studies of planet formation and dynamics in star clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) highlight the complexities and richness of these problems .",
    "however , much work remains to be done .",
    "investigations based on scattering experiments , like those conducted here , should be expanded to include binary - binary , single - triple , and binary - triple stellar interactions .",
    "alternatively , detailed @xmath73-body simulations should be used to study the fates of planets in systems with @xmath1710@xmath16 stars , covering a wide range of initial conditions and assumptions regarding the statistics of binary and triple stars .",
    "i thank phil arras for numerous valuable discussions and for providing critical comments on the paper .",
    "i am grateful to the referee , greg laughlin , for asking probing questions about the results of this study .",
