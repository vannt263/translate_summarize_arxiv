    "the notion of _ random partitions _ has played a central role in recent studies on supersymmetric gauge theories",
    ". a highlight will be the work of nekrasov and okounkov @xcite who used random partitions to derive the seiberg - witten solution @xcite of @xmath9 @xmath10 supersymmetric gauge theories .",
    "random partitions emerge therein through nekrasov s formula @xcite of the instanton sum for the gauge theories in the @xmath3 background @xcite .",
    "this statistical model has been extended @xcite to investigate the integrability of correlation functions of single - traced chiral observables .",
    "such an extension of the seiberg - witten theory also becomes attractive to understand @xmath9 @xmath1 supersymmetric gauge theories by providing a powerful tool @xcite .",
    "the so - called melting crystal model provides a similar statistical model for @xmath0 @xmath1 supersymmetric gauge theories @xcite and @xmath11-model topological strings @xcite .",
    "this is a statistical model of _ random plane partitions _",
    ", also interpreted as a @xmath12-deformation of random partitions @xcite , that stems from nekrasov s formula @xcite for @xmath0 supersymmetric gauge theories in the @xmath3 background .",
    "recently , an extension of this melting crystal model with external potentials was proposed , and its integrable structure was elucidated @xcite . it was argued therein that the external potentials are related to loop operators of a @xmath0 @xmath1 supersymmetric yang - mills theory ( sym ) .",
    "the goal of this paper is to present the detail of this result along with some implications . in particular , we study the thermodynamic limit of the partition function of this model , and solve a riemann - hilbert problem that determines the limit shape of the main diagonal slice of random plane partitions in the presence of external potentials .",
    "we can thus eventually identify a relevant complex curve and the associated seiberg - witten differential .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 starts with a brief review about @xmath0 @xmath1 sym in the @xmath3 background .",
    "we introduce loop operators @xmath13 @xmath14 of this theory . computation of correlation functions among these operators is presented by using the localization technique .",
    "generating function of the correlation functions of @xmath4 theory is expressed as a statistical sum over partitions and reproduces the partition function of the aforementioned melting crystal model .",
    "for an application of the localization theorem , we use equivariant descent equations of the loop operators , which is proved in appendix b , and a related @xmath15-action on the gauge theory is argued in appendix a. section 3 is concerned with a common integrable structure of @xmath0 @xmath1 sym in the @xmath3 background and melting crystal model .",
    "the loop operators are converted to the external potentials of the melting crystal model .",
    "this eventually shows that , by regarding the coupling constants @xmath16 of the loop operators as a series of time variables , the generating function becomes a @xmath5 function of @xmath6-toda hierarchy . in section 4",
    ", we introduce an energy functional .",
    "this functional is a quadratic form , and obtained from the logarithm of the statistical weight in the partition function .",
    "the formula is stated in a general setting and is proved in appendix c. by using the formula , we argue the thermodynamic limit of the melting crystal model or the @xmath12-deformed random partitions . in section 5 , the thermodynamic limit is reformulated as a riemann - hilbert problem to obtain an analytic function on @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a cylinder and @xmath19 is an interval in the real axis , and satisfies suitable conditions . in section 6 , we solve the riemann - hilbert problem .",
    "the relevant complex curve and the associated seiberg - witten differential are presented .",
    "the vev s of the loop operators are particularly expressed as residue integrals of the seiberg - witten differential .",
    "the solution of the riemann - hilbert problem can be further analyzed by applying the classical jensen formula in complex analysis .",
    "the case of the single coupling constant @xmath20 is described as an example .",
    "the related computation is attached to appendix d. section 7 is devoted to conclusion and discussion .",
    "we first consider an ordinary @xmath0 @xmath1 sym on @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath22 be the @xmath23-bundle on @xmath24 with @xmath25 .",
    "a gauge bundle of the theory is the @xmath23-bundle @xmath26 on @xmath21 pulled back from @xmath24 , where @xmath27 is the projection from @xmath21 to @xmath24 .",
    "all the fields in the vector multiplet are set to be periodic along @xmath28 . among them , the bosonic ingredients are a @xmath0 gauge potential @xmath29 and a scalar field @xmath30 taking the value in @xmath31 , where the coordinates @xmath32 represent coordinates @xmath33 of @xmath24 and a periodic coordinate @xmath34 of @xmath28 .",
    "these bosonic fields describe a @xmath0 yang - mills - higgs system .",
    "the gauge potential can be separated into two parts @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively the components of the @xmath24- and the @xmath28-directions .",
    "let @xmath37 be the infinite dimensional affine space consisting of all the gauge potentials on @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath9 component @xmath35 describes a loop @xmath38 in @xmath37 , where the loop is parametrized by the periodic coordinate of the fifth - dimensional circle . as for @xmath39 ,",
    "together with @xmath30 , the combination @xmath40 describes a loop @xmath41 in @xmath42 , which is the space of all the sections of @xmath43 , where ad@xmath22 is the adjoint bundle on @xmath24 with fibre @xmath31 . taking account of the periodicity",
    ", the same argument is applicable to the gauginos as well .",
    "the vector multiplet thereby describes a loop in the configuration space of the @xmath9 theory . by using such a loop",
    ", we may describe @xmath0 @xmath1 sym . in the case of the yang - mills - higgs system ,",
    "the loop @xmath38 gives a family of covariant differentials on @xmath22 as @xmath44 .",
    "for the loop @xmath41 , since it involves @xmath39 , we conveniently introduce a differential operator @xmath45 by @xmath46      via the standard dimensional reductions , @xmath47 @xmath1 sym gives lower dimensional yang - mills theories with @xmath48 supercharges , including the above theory .",
    "furthermore , the dimensional reductions in the @xmath3 background provide much powerful tools to understand these theories @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 background is a @xmath47 gravitational background on @xmath49 described by a metric of the form : @xmath50 where two vectors @xmath51 generate rotations on two - planes @xmath52 and @xmath53 in @xmath24 . by letting @xmath54 and @xmath55 , they are respectively the real part and the imaginary part of the combination @xmath56 the above combination",
    "is expressed in component as @xmath57 .    to see the dimensional reduction in the @xmath3-background ,",
    "let us first consider the bosonic part of the @xmath0 sym .",
    "the corresponding yang - mills - higgs system is modified from the previous one .",
    "however , the system is eventually controlled by replacing @xmath45 with @xmath58 here @xmath59 is an another differential operator given by @xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 denote the @xmath62 lorentz generators of the system .",
    "the above operator generates a @xmath15-action by taking the commutators with @xmath63 and @xmath45 .",
    "for instance , we have @xmath64 = -\\iota_{v_{\\epsilon_1,\\epsilon_2}}f_{a(t)}\\ , ,   \\label{torus action on a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the right - hand side means @xmath65 times the contraction of the curvature two - form @xmath66 with the vector field @xmath67 .",
    "as is argued in appendix [ torus_action_on_a ] , the infinitesimal rotation @xmath68 can generate a @xmath15-action on @xmath37 .",
    "the right - hand side of ( [ torus action on a ] ) is precisely the infinitesimal form ( [ t_epsilon_a ] ) of the @xmath15-action .",
    "the supercharges @xmath69 and @xmath70 are realized in a way different from the case of @xmath71 .",
    "note that we use the @xmath9 notation such that @xmath72 and @xmath73 denote the indexes of the lorentz group @xmath74 and the r - symmetry @xmath75 . according to the argument @xcite",
    ", we may interpret the @xmath0 sym as a topological field theory @xcite . actually , by regarding the diagonal @xmath76 of @xmath77 as a new @xmath78",
    ", we can extract a supercharge that behaves as a scalar under the new lorentz symmetry .",
    "we write the scalar supercharge as @xmath79 .",
    "the gaugino acquires a natural interpretation as differential forms , @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "these give fermionic loops , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the main part of the @xmath84-transformation can be read as @xmath85\\ , , \\label{q transform ( a , psi ) } \\\\ & & q_{\\epsilon_1,\\epsilon_2 } \\mathcal{h}_{\\epsilon_1,\\epsilon_2}(t)=0\\ , , \\label{q transform h}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath86 is a fermionic loop in @xmath87 .",
    "the action of the @xmath0 sym can be now written in a @xmath84-exact form as @xmath88 the above action turns out to be a brst gauge fixed action of the topological term @xmath89 , where @xmath79 plays a role of the brst charge . in this formulation , the original vector multiplet is splitted to several @xmath84-multiplets , including @xmath90 as the doublet and @xmath91 as the singlet .",
    "we may integrate out all the multiplets except the two .",
    "the integrations impose constraints on the two multiplets . as for the doublet",
    ", the constraints turn to involve three equations ; @xmath92 , @xmath93 , where the symbol @xmath94 means self - dual part of two - forms on @xmath24 , and @xmath95 .",
    "the first equation is the anti - self dual equation for gauge potentials on @xmath22 .",
    "the second equation is regarded as a linearization of the first . for the singlet",
    ", the constraint leads to the equation @xmath96 where @xmath97 . in the above",
    ", @xmath98 is the formal adjoint of @xmath63 and @xmath99 is the scalar laplacian .      taking account of the relation @xmath100 ,",
    "the following path - ordered integral becomes an analogue of holonomy of the 5@xmath101 gauge potential : @xmath102 where the symbol means path - ordered integration , more precisely , it is defined by the differential equation @xmath103 the trace of the holonomy along the circle defines a loop operator by @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the circumference of @xmath28 .",
    "the above operator is an analogue of the wilson loop operator along the circle . unlike the case of @xmath71 @xcite , it is not @xmath84-closed except at @xmath106 . to see this , note that the @xmath84-transformations ( [ q transform ( a , psi ) ] ) and ( [ q transform h ] ) imply @xmath107 . by using this",
    ", we obtain the transformation @xmath108 since the right - hand side of the above formula vanishes only at @xmath106 , this means that @xmath109 becomes @xmath84-closed only at @xmath106 .",
    "the above property may be explained in terms of the equivariant de rham theory . to see this ,",
    "let us first generalize the path - ordered integral ( [ w_(0 ) ] ) by exponentiating the combination @xmath110 in place of @xmath41 as @xmath111 where the right - hand side is the solution of the differential equation @xmath112 this particularly means that @xmath113 has several components , according to degrees of differential forms on @xmath24 , as @xmath114 , where the indexes denote the degrees .",
    "we then generalize the loop operator ( [ o_(0 ) ] ) as @xmath115 in parallel with @xmath113 , we have the decomposition @xmath116 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath117 are operators of the following form : @xmath118    eq.([qo_(0 ) ] ) can be now expressed as @xmath119 , which is actually the first equation among a series of the equations that @xmath117 obey .",
    "such equations eventually show up by expanding component - wise the identity @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the @xmath15-equivariant differential on @xmath24 .",
    "the above identity implies in components @xmath15-equivariant descent equations of the form @xmath122 where @xmath123 .",
    "we provide a proof of the formula ( [ formula of o ] ) in appendix [ proof : formula of o ] .",
    "we can also consider the loop operators encircling the circle many times .",
    "correspondingly , we introduce",
    "@xmath124 these satisfy @xmath125    let us examine the correlation functions @xmath126 .",
    "since the integral @xmath127 is @xmath84-closed by virtue of the formula ( [ formula of o_k ] ) , the correlation function has an interpretation in the topological field theory . in particular",
    ", we may compute the correlation functions by a supersymmetric quantum mechanics ( sqm ) which is substantially equivalent to the @xmath0 sym as the topological field theory .",
    "such a sqm turns out to be an equivariant sqm on @xmath128 @xcite , where @xmath128 is the moduli space of the framed @xmath129 instantons .",
    "we may regard @xmath128 as a riemannian manifold .",
    "actually , by taking a local gauge slice of the anti - self dual gauge potentials , the metric is induced from @xmath130 , where @xmath130 is endowed with a gauge invariant metric of the form , @xmath131 .",
    "take a loop @xmath132 , where @xmath133 denote local coordinates of @xmath128 .",
    "we also introduce its fermionic partner @xmath134 .",
    "both are parametrized by the fifth - dimensional circle .",
    "the @xmath84-transformation ( [ q transform ( a , psi ) ] ) yields a transformation between them . to describe the transformation , note that the infinitesimal variation @xmath135 preserves the anti - self dual equation @xmath136 ,",
    "thus it gives a vector field on @xmath128 , which we denote by @xmath137 .",
    "it is actually a killing vector .",
    "this apparently follows since the aforementioned variation preserves the gauge invariant metric @xmath138 .",
    "the @xmath84-transformation ( [ q transform ( a , psi ) ] ) is eventually converted to the transformation @xmath139    the supersymmetric yang - mills is described effectively in terms of @xmath140 and @xmath141 , consequently reduces to a quantum mechanical system on @xmath128 .",
    "actually , the corresponding action can be obtained from ( [ 5d sym_epsilon ] ) by integrating out the irrelevant fields .",
    "this yields the action @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the riemannian metric on @xmath128 .",
    "the above action together with the supersymmetry ( [ q transform ( m , chi ) ] ) is familiar in the physical proof @xcite of the equivariant index formula for dirac operator .",
    "in particular , the partition function becomes eventually the @xmath15-equivariant index for the dirac operator on @xmath128 @xcite .",
    "the combination @xmath110 in ( [ w ] ) can be identified with a loop space analogue of the @xmath15-equivariant curvature @xmath144 of the universal connection @xcite , where the universal bundle becomes equivariant by the @xmath15-action on @xmath145 . in the computation of the correlation function , by virtue of the supersymmetry ( [ q transform ( m , chi ) ] )",
    ", only the constant modes @xmath146 contribute to the observables .",
    "for such constant modes , the above combination is precisely identified with the equivariant curvature @xmath144 @xcite .",
    "this means that @xmath147 substantially truncates to the @xmath15-equivariant chern character @xmath148 .",
    "thus we obtain the following finite dimensional integral representation of the correlation functions : @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the @xmath15-equivariant @xmath151-genus of the tangent bundle of @xmath128 , and @xmath152 is a generator of @xmath15 that gives the killing vector @xmath137 .    introducing coupling constants @xmath16 , the generating function of the correlation functions",
    "is given by @xmath153 .",
    "since @xmath129-instanton contributes with the weight @xmath154 , where @xmath155 is the dynamical scale , letting @xmath156 , we can express the generating function as @xmath157      the right - hand side of the formula ( [ correlator of o_a ] ) is eventually replaced with a statistical sum over partitions . to see their appearance ,",
    "note that the integration localizes to the fixed points of the @xmath15-action .",
    "however , the fixed points in @xmath128 are small instanton singularities since the variation @xmath158 vanishes there .",
    "these singularities can be resolved by instantons on a non - commutative @xmath24 . by using such a regularization via the non - commutativity ,",
    "the fixed points get isolated , so that they are eventually labelled by using partitions @xcite .",
    "a partition @xmath159 is a sequence of non - negative integers satisfying @xmath160 for all @xmath161 .",
    "partitions are identified with the young diagrams in the standard manner .",
    "the size is defined by @xmath162 , which is the total number of boxes of the diagram .",
    "let us examine the formula ( [ correlator of o_a ] ) for the @xmath4 theory .",
    "the relevant computation of the localization can be found in @xcite .",
    "we truncate @xmath163 as @xmath164 , where @xmath165 is a positive real parameter .",
    "consequently , the formula becomes a @xmath12-series by the truncation , where @xmath166 .",
    "the fixed points in @xmath128 are labelled by partitions of @xmath129 .",
    "the equivariant @xmath151-genus takes the following form at the partition @xmath167 of @xmath129 : @xmath168 where @xmath169 denotes the hook length of the box @xmath170 of the young diagram @xmath167 .",
    "the right - hand side of the above formula can be expressed by using a schur function as @xmath171 where @xmath172 is the schur function @xmath173 specialized to @xmath174 , and @xmath175 . to obtain ( [ u(1 ) dirac_index ] ) , we have made use of the @xmath12-hook formula @xcite @xmath176 where @xmath177 .",

    "similarly , the fixed points in @xmath180 are given as @xmath181 , where @xmath167 is a partition of @xmath129 and @xmath182 is the origin of @xmath24 .",

    "reduces to a summation over contributions from the isolated fixed points of the @xmath15-action on @xmath187 .",
    "the contribution from the fixed point consists of two factors .",
    "one is the value of the integrand at the fixed point , and the other is the jacobian factor in a change of coordinates in a neighborhood of the fixed point . by multiplying these two factors and summing up them over the fixed points , we obtain the right - hand side of ( [ correlator of o_a ] ) .",
    "the fixed points are of the form @xmath188 , where @xmath167 is a partition of @xmath129 and @xmath189 is the origin of @xmath190 .",
    "the values of the integrand at the fixed points can be expressed by using the formulas ( [ u(1 ) dirac_index ] ) and ( [ o_l(lambda ) ] ) .",
    "the jacobian factor can be further factorized by the product structure of @xmath128 and @xmath24 s .",
    "the jacobian factor originating in the change of coordinates of @xmath128 in a neighborhood of @xmath167 takes the form @xmath191 , while the equivariant volume of @xmath190 is given by the products of @xmath192 for each @xmath193 .",
    "therefore , the formula ( [ correlator of o_a ] ) becomes eventually the statistical sum over partitions given by @xmath194 where the summation is taken over partitions of @xmath129 .",
    "although we have not taken into account , the chern - simon term can be added to a @xmath0 gauge theory , with the coupling constant being quantized , in particular , for the @xmath4 theory , @xmath195 .",
