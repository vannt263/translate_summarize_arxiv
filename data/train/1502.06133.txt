    "social networks play a fundamental role in the spread of influence on a large scale ; this is harnessed by companies for viral marketing . the problem of _ influence maximization _ deals with selecting @xmath0 seed nodes where the diffusion should be triggered , so as to maximize the influence when diffusion concludes ; we call @xmath0 as the budget .",
    "this problem has been extensively studied in the literature @xcite , including that of aamas @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of using multiple phases for maximizing an objective function has been presented in @xcite . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "ours is the first detailed effort to study multi - phase diffusion in social networks .",
    "an advantage of multi - phase diffusion is that the seed nodes in any phase , except the first one , can be chosen based on the spread observed so far , thus having more certainty during seed selection . but",
    "owing to delayed seed selection , the diffusion may be slower , leading to compromise of time .",
    "as a starting point , we focus on two - phase diffusion . given a graph @xmath1 , we consider independent cascade ( ic ) model where , @xmath2 is the probability with which node @xmath3 can influence @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath5 be a live graph ( got by independently sampling edges in @xmath1 ) and @xmath6 be the probability of its occurrence .",
    "let @xmath7 be the number of nodes reachable from set @xmath8 in @xmath5 ( so expected number of influenced nodes at the end of single phase diffusion with seed set @xmath8 is @xmath9 )",
    ".    at the beginning ( time 0 ) , let @xmath10 seed nodes be selected for first phase and after delay @xmath11 , @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) for second phase .",
    "we aim to maximize the expected influence at the end of two - phase diffusion . for now , assume @xmath14 , @xmath11 to be given ; our objective is to determine seeds for the two phases .",
    "let @xmath15 be the seed set for first phase and @xmath5 be the destined live graph ( unknown at time 0 ) .",
    "let @xmath16 be the observed diffusion at time @xmath11 , which gives @xmath17 and @xmath18 , the sets of already and recently influenced nodes , respectively . at time @xmath11 ,",
    "given that nodes in @xmath18 effectively are seeds for second phase ( as per ic model ) , we aim to select an additional seed set @xmath19 of size @xmath12 , that maximizes the final influence .",
    "we obtain @xmath20 since @xmath16 is unique for a particular @xmath21 .",
    "so our objective is to find @xmath15 that maximizes @xmath22    note that the choice of @xmath23 depends not just on @xmath5 , but on @xmath16 , and hence on all live graphs that could result from @xmath16 ( like in single phase , choice of the best seed set depends on all live graphs that could result from @xmath1 ) .",
    "np - hardness of maximizing @xmath24 is clear .",
    "it can be shown that , for fixed @xmath12 and @xmath11 , @xmath24 is non - negative and monotone increasing ( note that with @xmath12 and @xmath11 as variables , @xmath24 is not monotone ) , but it is neither submodular nor supermodular . however , it was observed using simulations on the test graphs , that the diminishing marginal returns property ( characteristic of submodular functions ) holds in most cases .    _",
