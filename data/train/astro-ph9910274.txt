    "the analysis of near - infrared ( nir ) features in the spectral region @xmath1 6000 - 10000  in the integrated light of globular clusters and galaxies has become of common use to infer the parameters of their stellar populations .",
    "the nir spectral region is specially interesting for stellar population studies because m stars ( giants and dwarfs ) give their maximum contribution to the integrated spectrum of galaxies and clusters in these wavelengths . as an example ,",
    "nir line indices which are sensitive to the surface gravity of m stars can be used to constrain the low mass end of the mass function .",
    "also , nir indices are suitable for deriving metallicities because of their remarkable insensitivity to age .",
    "the metallicity calibration of globular clusters using the caii triplet has been carried out by bica et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for globular clusters in the galactic bulge , and by olszewski et al .",
    "( 1991 ) for clusters in the magellanic clouds .",
    "long standing problems with the use of imf - sensitive nir features in composite systems were discussed in whitford ( 1977 ) , cohen ( 1978 , 1979 ) , faber & french ( 1980 ) , alloin & bica ( 1989 ) , xu et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , boroson & thompson ( 1991 ) , delisle & hardy ( 1992 ) and couture & hardy ( 1993 ) , which studied the nai , caii and feh indices in integrated spectra of galaxies and clusters .    in spite of the above mentioned efforts , the strong spectral features which appear in the integrated nir spectrum of globular clusters and normal galaxies have been far less exploited in stellar population studies than the indices in the optical region , such as mg@xmath6 , fe5270 , and fe5335 ( burstein et al .",
    "1984 ; worthey 1994 ; trager et al . 1998 ) .",
    "this fact is probably due to two main reasons : the nir features show a more complex behavior than the ` green ' features , and the nir region presents numerous telluric lines which require a proper and careful subtraction .    in this context ,",
    "spectrum synthesis based on model stellar photospheres and comprehensive line lists can play a key rle in disentangling the degenerate behaviour of line indices as a function of metallicity , effective temperature and surface gravity . in an attempt to improve our understanding of the nir features , schiavon & barbuy ( 1999 , hereafter sb99 )",
    "have built an extensive grid of synthetic spectra , based on state - of - the - art model photospheres and molecular and atomic line lists .",
    "the nai ` doublet ' at @xmath58190 and the feh wing - ford band ( wfb ) at 9900 ( wing & ford 1969 ) were studied as a function of stellar photospheric parameters by schiavon et al .",
    "( 1997a , b ) , whereas the behavior of the tio bands and the caii triplet were described in milone & barbuy ( 1994 ) , sb99 and erderlyi - mendes & barbuy ( 1991 ) .",
    "in this paper we use the grid of high resolution synthetic stellar spectra presented in sb99 , to build integrated spectra of single - aged stellar populations ( ssps ) in the wavelength range @xmath1 6000 - 10200  .",
    "previous work with similar aims was presented by garcia - vargas et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and milone et al .",
    "( 1995 ) where equivalent widths of the caii triplet and tio respectively were given .",
    "these models are a useful guide in the interpretation of the integrated spectrum of early - type galaxies , which in the nir are dominated by m - type stars , and for a better understanding of the age - metallicity degeneracy of old and intermediate age stellar populations .    in  2 we present basic information on the spectrum synthesis of individual stellar models and on the other ingredients required to build the ssp models . in",
    "3 we discuss the behavior of selected nir features as a function of ssp parameters : metallicity , age and imf . a summary is presented in  4 .",
    "sb99 computed a grid of high resolution synthetic spectra in the wavelength range @xmath1 6000  10200  .",
    "the photospheric models by kurucz ( 1992 ) , plez et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , further unpublished models by plez ( 1997 ) , and allard & hauschildt ( 1995 ) were adopted .",
    "the grid covers the following ranges of stellar parameters : 2500 @xmath2 t@xmath7 @xmath2 6000 k , -0.5 @xmath2 log g @xmath2 5.0 , [ m / h ] = -0.5 , 0.0 and + 0.5 , and [ @xmath4/fe ] = 0.0 .",
    "the molecular electronic systems included in the calculations are : the cn ( a@xmath8x@xmath9 ) red system , the c@xmath6 ( a@xmath10x@xmath11 ) swan system , the tio @xmath12(a@xmath13x@xmath14 ) , @xmath15(b@xmath16x@xmath14 ) , @xmath17(b@xmath18a@xmath19 ) , @xmath20(e@xmath16x@xmath14 ) , and @xmath21(b@xmath18d@xmath22 ) systems , and the feh ( a@xmath23x@xmath23 ) , which includes the wfb . the synthetic spectra were computed in steps of 0.02  and rebinned to 1.0  with fwhm = 2.0  .",
    "more details on the atmospheric models and the atomic and molecular data employed are given in sb99 .",
    "we have combined our grid of synthetic stellar spectra with isochrones collected from the literature to build ssp synthetic spectra .",
    "we adopted the padova isochrones ( bertelli et al .",
    "1994 ) for @xmath24 , and the isochrones from baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for @xmath25 .",
    "we have built integrated spectra of ssps for [ m / h ] = -0.5 , 0.0 and + 0.5 , and two different imf slopes : @xmath0 = 1.35 ( salpeter ) and @xmath0 = 2.0 ( dwarf enriched ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig flux ] we show examples of the computed spectra in the wavelength range @xmath1 6000 - 10200  , normalized at @xmath58157  and convolved with a gaussian of fwhm = 9 , for a range of ages ( fig . [ fig flux]a ) , metallicities ( fig .",
    "[ fig flux]b ) and imfs ( fig .",

    "[ fig flux]c ) , the spectrum becomes somewhat redder .    in order to test our ssp integrated spectra , we have ( 1 ) compared results obtained with padova and geneva isochrones , and ( 2 ) applied our calculations to the metal - rich globular cluster ngc 6553 , as described below .",
    "a check of our results obtained with the padova isochrones was carried out by using the isochrones from the geneva group ( schaller et al .",
    "1992 as given in cd - rom by leitherer et al .",
    "1996 ) for stars with @xmath24 , to compute the integrated spectrum of a 13 gyrs old ssp with solar metallicity and salpeter imf . for lower masses we use baraffe et al.s isochrones in all cases . in figures [ isoch ] and [ isocomp ]",
    "we compare , respectively , the geneva and padova isochrones , and corresponding integrated spectra ( normalized at @xmath26 ) .    from figure [ isoch ]",
    "it can be seen that the geneva and padova isochrones present differences in the red giant branch .",
    "while in the first ascent giant branch the geneva isochrones present a systematically lower temperature ( @xmath27100k ) , their red giant tip is much hotter and brighter ( for a given temperature ) than in the padova isochrones .",
    "the coolest red giant stars in the geneva isochrone have t@xmath283300k , while in the padova isochrone red giants can be as cool as t@xmath292600k .    in spite of these large differences in the isochrones ,",
    "the integrated spectra look remarkably similar in figure [ isocomp ] . the integrated spectrum computed from the padova isochrones is brighter than the geneva one by less than 5% in both ends of the interval . by looking at figure 11 of sb99 ,",
    "these small differences can be explained by the fact that stars from the tip of the red giant branch ( stars later than m4 ) , which are cooler in the padova isochrones , dominate the integrated light of old ssps at @xmath30 , while stars from the warmer part of the red giant branch - rgb ( spectral types from mid - k to early - m ) , which are cooler in the geneva isochrones , are dominant in the bluer part of the spectral interval under study .",
    "the differences in the studied indices are small ( @xmath31 10% in equivalent width ) except for the wing - ford band , for which a 30% difference in equivalent width is found , due to the sensitivity of this feature to the temperature of rgb tip stars .",
    "the fact that we obtain so small spectral differences suggests the existence of a mutual compensation between the above mentioned differences in the isochrones .",
    "our choice to adopt the padova set of isochrones is based on our recent study of the t@xmath7 scale of m giants in the bulge metal - rich globular cluster ngc 6553 ( sb99 ) .",
    "the metallicity of ngc 6553 found in the literature ranges from -0.70 @xmath31 [ fe / h ] @xmath31 + 0.47 ( see table 5 in barbuy et al .",
    "high resolution spectroscopy tends to give lower values : -0.7 @xmath31 [ fe / h ] @xmath31 -0.2 , whereas integrated photometry or spectroscopy give higher values : -0.33 @xmath31 [ fe / h ] @xmath31 + 0.47 .",
    "rutledge et al . ( 1997 ) gives [ fe / h ] = -0.18 or -0.60 depending whether they use the metallicity scale of globular clusters by zinn & west ( 1984 ) or by carretta & gratton ( 1997 ) .",
    "barbuy et al . ( 1999 ) obtained [ fe / h ] @xmath32 -0.55 and [ @xmath4/fe ] @xmath32 + 0.4 , which would explain the discrepancy between results obtained from high resolution measurements of fe lines and integrated spectra where lines of fe and @xmath4-elements give together [ z / z@xmath33 @xmath32 0.0 .",
    "cohen et al .",
    "( 1999 ) on the other hand , obtained [ fe / h ] @xmath32 -0.2 and [ @xmath4/fe ] @xmath32 0.2 . in terms of our present purposes , since the spectra are dominated by the m giants , whose spectra are in turn dominated by tio bands , and given that both ti and o are @xmath4 elements , the use of an overall metallicity of [ m / h ] @xmath32 0.0 is in agreement with the above two results ( barbuy et al .",
    "1999 and cohen et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the t@xmath34-scale inferred by sb99 for ngc 6553 , based on tio bands , is more compatible with the temperature values in the padova isochrones , which in particular have a more extended rgb tip ; the extension of the rgb of ngc 6553 can be seen in bruzual et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and guarnieri et al .",
    "moreover , in a study of the t@xmath7s of m giants from ngc 6528 ( another metal rich globular cluster from the galactic bulge , see ortolani et al .",
    "1995 ) , we determined t@xmath7 = 3000 k for a bonafide m giant of this cluster , which is 300k cooler than the lowest t@xmath7 predicted by the geneva isochrone ( schiavon et al . 1999 , in preparation ) .",
