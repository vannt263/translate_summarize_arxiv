    "this interest is motivated by the possible effects that a heterogeneous topology might have on the location of the epidemic threshold @xmath3 , for some control parameter @xmath4 , signaling a phase transition separating a healthy , disease - free phase , from an infected phase , in which the epidemics can thrive @xcite .    for epidemics leading to a steady ( endemic ) state",
    ", the main object of interest has been the susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sis ) model , which is defined as follows @xcite : individuals , represented as nodes in the network , can assume two different states , susceptible ( @xmath5 ) or healthy , and infected ( @xmath6 ) , and are capable to transmit the disease .",
    "infected individuals recover and become spontaneously susceptible again with a rate @xmath7 that can be taken equal to @xmath8 .",
    "transmission of the disease is effected by a rate to transmit the disease through an edge connecting an infected to a susceptible node equal to a constant @xmath4 . after a considerable theoretical effort",
    ", it has been shown that the behavior of the sis model in uncorrelated @xcite sf networks is far from trivial @xcite .",
    "two competing theories were initially proposed to account for the sis epidemic threshold .",
    "heterogeneous mean - field ( hmf ) theories @xcite , neglecting both dynamical and topological correlations , provide a threshold @xmath9 @xcite , which tends to zero in the thermodynamic limit for @xmath10 , and is finite for @xmath11 .",
    "quenched mean - field ( qmf ) theory @xcite , including the full network structure through its adjacency matrix @xmath12 @xcite , but still neglecting dynamical correlations , predicts instead a threshold @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix . the scaling form of this threshold is given by  @xcite @xmath15 for @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the maximum degree in the network , while for @xmath18 it yields @xmath19 in agreement with hmf theory .",

    "the fact that the lifetime @xmath21 is diverging with degree @xmath1 faster than @xmath22 for any value of @xmath4 is the ultimate cause of the null epidemic threshold in the sis model @xcite .",

    "qmf theories are expected to be qualitatively correct . on the other hand , for @xmath29 , mutual hub reinfection can not take place , and an endemic state is possible only through a collective activation of the whole network in a standard phase transition occurring at a finite threshold . in this second scenario ,",
    "hmf theories should be correct .",
    "we present evidence for this scenario analyzing the susceptible - infected - removed - susceptible ( sirs ) model  @xcite , an extension of the sis model allowing for a waning immunity of nodes .",
    "while it has be shown that sirs is equivalent to sis dynamics in the framework of standard mean - field theories @xcite , here we show that the effect of waning immunity is to induce a finite threshold in sf networks for @xmath30 , at odds with qmf and qualitatively described by hmf theory . for sake of generality ,",

    "this hub activation scenario leads to a vanishing threshold when the lifespan is diverging in the thermodynamic limit . in this case ,",
    "qmf theories are expected to be qualitatively correct .",
    "the reason underlying the effectiveness of qmf theories lies in the fact that they take into account the full topological structure of the network , and are dominated by the effects of the largest hubs . on the other hand , for a lifespan smaller than the infection time scale , hub activation can not be sustained and possible epidemic phase transitions should be the result of a collective activation process , leading to a standard phase transition at a finite threshold , as in the case of the cp . in this second scenario ,",
    "hmf theories should be qualitatively correct , due to the fact the they work on the annealed network approximation , in which every node can interact with every other with a degree dependent probability @xcite .    to check the validity of the criterion , we have investigated a generic epidemic model with spontaneous recovering , waning immunity , and edge degree dependent infection rates on scale - free networks , for which we can compute analytic expressions for the hub recovery and infection time scales .",
    "the model has as particular cases the fundamental epidemic models , as the sis , sirs and contact processes ( cp ) as well as more complex ones as the generalized sis model of ref .",
    "@xcite , which we have considered . after exemplifying our framework with the known cases of the sis and cp models , we present an extended discussion of the sirs model , an extension of the sis model with waning immunity .",
    "while previous analytic approaches ( hmf and qmf theories ) predict for the sirs model the same behavior than the sis model , the main result from out criterion is that we are able to show that , instead , the effect of even a small amount of waning immunity is able to restore a finite threshold ( albeit affect by possible strong finite - size effects ) in scale - free networks with degree exponent @xmath30 , at odds with the qmf theory valid for sis in this regime , and in agreement with hmf .",
    "our predictions are corroborated by means of numerical simulation on synthetic uncorrelated scale - free networks , as well as on real correlated networks .",
    "the proposed criterion represents a step forward in our understanding of the properties of the epidemic transition in epidemic modeling , and thus opens the path to study more general and realistic models . in this sense ,",
    "its application to more complex models is straightforward , only possible hampered by technical difficulties in extracting analytic expressions for the hub lifetime and infection time scales .",
    "these time scales can , however , be numerically estimated from direct simulations of epidemics on star networks , as we have shown in the examples presented here .",
