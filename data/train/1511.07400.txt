    "[ sec:1 ] magnetized plasmas are encountered in a wide variety of astrophysical situations , but also in magnetic fusion devices such as tokamaks , where a large external magnetic field needs to be applied in order to keep the particles on the desired tracks .    in particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations of such devices",
    ", this large external magnetic field obviously needs to be taken into account when pushing the particles .",
    "however , due to the magnitude of the concerned field this often adds a new time scale to the simulation and thus a stringent restriction on the time step . in order",
    "to get rid of this additional time scale , we would like to find approximate equations , where only the gross behavior implied by the external field would be retained and which could be used in a numerical simulation .",
    "in the simplest situation , the trajectory of a particle in a constant magnetic field @xmath0 is a helicoid along the magnetic field lines with a radius proportional to the inverse of the magnitude of @xmath0 .",
    "hence , when this field becomes very large the particle gets trapped along the magnetic field lines .",
    "however due to the fast oscillations around the apparent trajectory , its apparent velocity is smaller than the actual one .",
    "this result has been known for some time as the guiding center approximation , and the link between the real and the apparent velocity is well known in terms of @xmath0 .    here",
    ", we consider a plasma constituted of a large number of charged particles , which is described by the vlasov equation coupled with the maxwell or poisson equations to compute the self - consistent fields .",
    "it describes the evolution of a system of particles under the effects of external and self - consistent fields .",
    "the unknown @xmath1 , depending on the time @xmath2 , the position @xmath3 , and the velocity @xmath4 , represents the distribution of particles in phase space for each species with @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "its behaviour is given by the vlasov equation , @xmath7 where the force field @xmath8 is coupled with the distribution function @xmath9 giving a nonlinear system .",
    "we first define @xmath10 the charge density and @xmath11 the current density which are given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the elementary charge . for the vlasov - poisson model @xmath14 where @xmath15 represents the mass of one particle . on the other hand for the vlasov - maxwell model ,",
    "we have @xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xmath0 are solutions of the maxwell equations @xmath18 with the compatibility condition @xmath19 which is verified by the solutions of the vlasov equation . here",
    "we will consider an intermediate model where the magnetic field is given , @xmath20 with @xmath21 and we focus on the long time behavior of the plasma in the orthogonal plane to the external magnetic field , that is the two dimensional vlasov - poisson system with an external strong magnetic field @xmath22 here , for simplicity we set all physical constants to one and consider that @xmath23 is a small parameter related to the ratio between the reciprocal larmor frequency and the advection time scale .",
    "the term @xmath24 in front of the time derivative of @xmath9 stands for the fact that we want to approximate the solution for large time .",
    "we want to construct numerical solutions to the vlasov - poisson system ( [ eq : vlasov2d ] ) by particle methods ( see @xcite ) , which consist in approximating the distribution function by a finite number of macro - particles .",
    "the trajectories of these particles are computed from the characteristic curves corresponding to the vlasov equation @xmath25 where the electric field is computed from a discretization of the poisson equation in ( [ eq : vlasov2d ] ) on a mesh of the physical space .",
    "the main purpose of this work is the construction of efficient numerical methods for stiff transport equations of type ( [ eq : vlasov2d ] ) in the limit @xmath26 .",
    "indeed , setting @xmath27 the system ( [ traj:00 ] ) can be re - written for @xmath28 as @xmath29 therefore , we denote by @xmath30 the solution to ( [ traj:01 ] ) , and under some classical smoothness assumptions on the electromagnetic fields @xmath31 , it is well - known at least when @xmath32 or @xmath33 is homogeneous that @xmath34 converges weakly to zero when @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , where @xmath37 corresponds to the guiding center approximation @xmath38 here , we are of course interested in the behavior of the sequence solution @xmath39 to the vlasov - poisson system ( [ eq : vlasov2d ] ) when @xmath26 , which corresponds to the gyro - kinetic approximation of the vlasov - poissons system . following the work of l. saint - raymond @xcite ,",
    "it can be proved  at least when @xmath33 is homogeneous  that the charge density @xmath40 converges to the solution to the guiding center approximation @xmath41   -\\delta _ { { \\mathbf{x } } _",
    "\\perp}\\phi=\\rho , \\end{array } \\right .     \\label{eq : gc}\\ ] ] where the velocity @xmath42 is @xmath43 we observe that the limit system ( [ traj : limit ] ) corresponds to the characteristic curves to the limit equation ( [ eq : gc ] ) .",
    "we seek a method that is able to capture these properties , while the numerical parameters may be kept independent of the stiffness degree of these scales .",
    "this concept is known and widely studied for dissipative systems in the framework of asymptotic preserving schemes @xcite .",
    "contrary to collisional kinetic equations in hydrodynamic or diffusion asymptotic , collisionless equations like the vlasov - poisson system ( [ eq : vlasov2d ] ) involve time oscillations . in this context , the situation is more complicated than the one encountered in collisional regimes since we can not expect any dissipative phenomenon . therefore , the notion of two - scale convergence has been introduced both at the theoretical and numerical level @xcite in order to derive asymptotic models",
    ". however , these asymptotic models , obtained after removing the fast scales , are valid only when @xmath24 is small .",
    "we refer to e. frnod and e. sonnendrcker @xcite , and f. golse and l. saint - raymond @xcite for a theoretical point of view on these questions , and e. frnod , f. salvarani and e. sonnendrcker @xcite for numerical applications of such techniques .",
    "another approach is to combine both disparate scales into one and single model .",
    "such a decomposition can be done using a micro - macro approach ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "such a model may be used when the small parameter of the equation is not everywhere small .",
    "hence , a scheme for a micro - macro model can switch from one regime to another without any treatment of the transition between the different regimes . a different method",
    "consists in separating fast and slow time scales when such a structure can be identified @xcite or @xcite .",
    "theses techniques work well when the magnetic field is uniform since fast scales can be computed from a formal asymptotic analysis , but for more complicated problems , that is , when the external magnetic field depends on time and position @xmath3 , the generalization of this approach is an open problem .    in this paper",
    ", we propose an alternative to such methods allowing to make direct simulations of systems ( [ eq : vlasov2d ] ) with large time steps with respect to @xmath24 .",
    "we develop numerical schemes that are able to deal with a wide range of values for @xmath24 , so - called asymptotic preserving ( ap ) class @xcite , such schemes are consistent with the kinetic model for all positive value of @xmath24 , and degenerate into consistent schemes with the asymptotic model when @xmath44 .    before presenting our time discretization technique , let us first briefly review the basic tools of particle - in - cell methods which are widely used for plasma physics simulations @xcite .",
    "the numerical resolution of the vlasov equation and related models is usually performed by particle - in - cell ( pic ) methods which approximate the plasma by a finite number of particles .",
    "trajectories of these particles are computed from characteristic curves ( [ traj:00 ] ) corresponding to the the vlasov equation ( [ eq : vlasov2d ] ) , whereas self - consistent fields are computed on a mesh of the physical space .",
    "this method yields satisfying results with a relatively small number of particles but it is sometimes subject to fluctuations , due to the numerical noise , which are difficult to control . to improve the accuracy ,",
    "direct numerical simulation techniques have been developed .",
    "the vlasov equation is discretized in phase space using either semi - lagrangian @xcite , finite difference @xcite or discontinuous galerkin @xcite schemes . but",
    "these direct methods are very costly , hence several variants of particle methods have been developed over the past decades . in the complex particle kinetic scheme introduced by bateson and hewett @xcite",
    ", particles have a gaussian shape that is transformed by the local shearing of the flow",
    ". moreover they can be fragmented to probe for emerging features , and merged where fine particles are no longer needed . in the cloud in mesh ( cm ) scheme of alard and colombi @xcite particles",
    "also have gaussian shapes , and they are deformed by local linearization of the force field .",
    "more recently in @xcite , the authors proposed a linearly - transformed particle - in - cell method , that employs linear deformations of the particles .    here",
    "we focus on the time discretization technique , hence we will only consider standard particle method even if our approach is completely independant on the choice of the particle method .    the particles method consists in approximating the initial condition @xmath45 in ( [ eq : vlasov2d ] ) by the following dirac mass sum @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a beam of @xmath48 particles distributed in the four dimensional phase space according to the density function @xmath45 . afterwards , one approximates the solution of ( [ eq : vlasov2d ] ) , by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the position in phase space of particle @xmath51 moving along the characteristic curves ( [ traj:00 ] ) with the initial data @xmath52 , for @xmath53 .",
    "however when the vlasov equation is coupled with the poisson equation for the computation of the electric field , the dirac mass has to be replaced by a smooth function @xmath54 @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a particle shape function with radius proportional to @xmath24 , usually seen as a smooth approximation of the dirac measure obtained by scaling a compactly supported `` cut - off '' function @xmath57 for which common choices include b - splines and smoothing kernels with vanishing moments , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "particle centers are then pushed forward at each time @xmath2 by following a numerical approximation of the flow ( [ traj:00 ] ) , leading to @xmath58 in the classical error analysis @xcite , the above process is seen as    * an approximation ( in the distribution sense ) of the initial data by a collection of weighted dirac measures ; * the exact transport of the dirac particles along the flow ; * the smoothing of the resulting distribution @xmath59 with the convolution kernel @xmath60 .    the classical error estimate reads then as follows @xcite :    [ lmm:0 ] consider the vlasov equation with a given electromagnetic field @xmath61 and a smooth initial datum @xmath62 , with @xmath63 .",
    "if for some prescribed integers @xmath64 and @xmath65 , the cut - off @xmath66 has @xmath15-th order smoothness and satisfies a moment condition of order @xmath67 , namely , @xmath68 and @xmath69 then there exists a constant @xmath70 independent of @xmath45 , @xmath48 or @xmath71 , such that we have for all @xmath72 , @xmath73 when @xmath74 and @xmath75 where the ratio @xmath76 .",
    "note that following @xcite , it is also possible to get explicit order of convergence for the linear vlasov equation .",
    "let us also mention related papers where the convergence of a numerical scheme for the vlasov - poisson system is investigated .",
    "cottet and p .- a .",
    "raviart @xcite present a precise mathematical analysis of the particle method for solving the one - dimensional vlasov  poisson system .",
    "we also mention the papers of s. wollman and e. ozizmir @xcite and s. wollman @xcite on the topic .",
    "k. ganguly and h.d .",
    "victory give a convergence result for the vlasov - maxwell system @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec:3 ]",
    "we present several time discretization techniques based on high - order semi - implicit schemes @xcite for the vlasov - poisson system with a strong external magnetic field , and we prove uniform consistency of the schemes in the limit @xmath35 with preservation of the order of accuracy ( from first to third order accuracy ) . in section [ sec:4 ]",
    "we perform a rigorous analysis of the first order scheme for smooth electromagnetic fields .",
    "section [ sec:5 ] is then devoted to numerical simulations for one single particle motion and for the vlasov - poisson model for various asymptotics @xmath77 and @xmath78 , which illustrate the advantage of high order schemes .",
    "[ sec:3 ] let us now consider the system ( [ eq : vlasov2d ] ) and apply a particle method , where the key issue is to design a uniformly stable scheme with respect to the parameter @xmath79 , which is related to the magnitude of the external magnetic field .",

    "the numerical scheme that we describe here is proposed in the framework of particle - in - cell method , where the solution @xmath9 is discretized as follows @xmath84 where @xmath85 represents an approximation of the solution @xmath86 and @xmath87 to ( [ traj : bis ] ) .    when the vlasov equation ( [ eq : vlasov2d ] ) is coupled with the poisson equation ( [ poisson ] ) ,",

    "we propose several numerical schemes to the system ( [ traj : bis ] ) for which the index @xmath94 will be omitted .",
    "we start with the simplest semi - implicit scheme for ( [ traj : bis ] ) , which is a combination of backward and forward euler scheme .",

    "the consistency provided by the latter result is far from being uniform with respect to the time step .",
