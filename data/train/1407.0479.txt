    "<S> we consider charge transport across a finite graphene flake with a circular antidot defined in its center . </S>",
    "<S> the flake is connected to thin metallic armchair nanoribbons and the study covers the energy range within the neighborhood of the neutrality point . </S>",
    "<S> we solve the scattering problem using the tight - binding hamiltonian and find that conductance of the system is non - zero only near narrow resonances which are quasi - bound in either the entire cavity or the antidot itself . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the scanning probe technique can be used for the purpose of determination whether the state is localized within the antidot or in the entire cavity . </S>",
    "<S> we indicate that the potential of the perturbation shifts the position of the resonances and that the shifts are related to the localization of the scattering probability density . the resonance lifetime can be both decreased or increased as the perturbation introduced by the probe interferes with the current vortices inside the antidot . </S>"
