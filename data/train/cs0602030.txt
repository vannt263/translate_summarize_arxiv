    "the publication of capacity gains of mimo systems @xcite coding for mimo systems has been an active area of research and such codes have been christened space - time codes ( stc ) .",
    "the primary difference between coded modulation ( used for siso , simo ) and space - time codes is that in coded modulation the coding is in time only while in space - time codes the coding is in both space and time and hence the name .",
    "space - time codes ( stc ) can be thought of as a signal design problem at the transmitter to realize the capacity benefits of mimo systems @xcite , though , several developments towards stc were presented in @xcite which combine transmit and receive diversity , much prior to the results on capacity .",
    "formally , a thorough treatment of stcs was first presented in @xcite in the form of trellis codes ( space - time trellis codes ( sttc ) ) along with appropriate design and performance criteria ,    the decoding complexity of sttc is exponential in bandwidth efficiency and required diversity order .",
    "starting from alamouti @xcite , several authors have studied space - time block codes ( stbcs ) obtained from orthogonal designs ( ods ) and their variations that offer fast decoding ( single - symbol decoding or double - symbol decoding ) over quasi - static fading channels @xcite-@xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "but the stbcs from ods are a class of codes that are amenable to single - symbol decoding . due to the importance of single - symbol decodable codes",
    ", need was felt for rigorous characterization of single - symbol decodable linear stbcs .",
    "following the spirit of @xcite , by a linear stbc we mean those covered by the following definition .",
    "[ c0def1 ] a linear design , @xmath1 , is a @xmath2 matrix whose entries are complex linear combinations of @xmath3 complex indeterminates @xmath4 , @xmath5 and their complex conjugates .",
    "the stbc obtained by letting each indeterminate to take all possible values from a complex constellation @xmath6 is called a linear stbc over @xmath6 .",
    "notice that @xmath1 is basically a `` design''and by the stbc @xmath7 we mean the stbc obtained using the design @xmath1 with the indeterminates taking values from the signal constellation @xmath6 .",
    "the rate of the code / design the throughput rate @xmath8 in bits per second per hertz is related to the rate of the design @xmath9 as @xmath10 . ]",
    "is given by @xmath11 symbols / channel use .",
    "every linear design @xmath1 can be expressed as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a set of complex matrices called weight matrices of @xmath1 .",
    "when the signal set @xmath6 is understood from the context or with the understanding that an appropriate signal set @xmath6 will be specified subsequently , we will use the terms design and stbc interchangeably .    throughout the paper , we consider only those linear stbcs that are obtained from designs .",
    "linear stbcs can be decoded using simple linear processing at the receiver with algorithms like sphere - decoding @xcite which have polynomial complexity in , @xmath14 , the number of transmit antennas .",
    "but stbcs from ods stand out because of their amenability to very simple ( linear complexity in @xmath14 ) decoding .",
    "this is because the ml metric can be written as a sum of several square terms , each depending on at - most one variable for od . however , the rates of ods is restrictive ; resulting in search of other codes that allow simple decoding similar to ods .",
    "we call such codes `` single - symbol decodable ''",
    ". formally    [ c0def2 ] a single - symbol decodable ( sd ) stbc of rate @xmath11 in @xmath3 complex indeterminates @xmath4 , @xmath5 is a linear stbc such that the ml decoding metric can be written as a square of several terms each depending on at most one indeterminate",
    ".    examples of sd stbcs are stbcs from orthogonal designs of @xcite .    in this paper , we first characterize all linear stbcs that admit single - symbol ml decoding , ( not necessarily full - rank ) over quasi - static fading channels , the class of single - symbol decodable designs ( sdd ) .",
    "further , we characterize a class of full - rank sdds called full - rank sdd ( fsdd ) .",

    "the rest of the material of this paper is organized as follows : in section [ c5ch ] the channel model and the design criteria for both quasi - static and rapid - fading channels are reviewed .",
    "a brief presentation of basic , well known results concerning glcods is given in section [ glpcods ] . in section [ ssdd ]",
    "we characterize the class sdd of all sd ( not necessarily full - rank ) designs and within the class of sdd the class fsdd consisting of full - diversity sdd is characterized .",
    "section [ sqssdd ] deals exclusively with the maximal rate of square designs and construction of such maximal rate designs .    in section [ chap3 ]",
    "we generalize the construction of square rfsdds given in subsection [ frssdd ] , and give a formal definition for co - ordinate interleaved orthogonal designs ( ciod ) and its generalization , generalized co - ordinate interleaved orthogonal designs ( gciod ) .",
    "this generalization is basically a construction of rfsdd ; both square and non - square and results in construction of various high rate rfsdds . the signal set expansion due to co - ordinate interleaving",
    "is then highlighted and the coding gain of gciod is shown to be equal to what is defined as the generalized co - ordinate product distance ( gcpd ) for a signal set .",
    "a special case of gcpd , the co - ordinate product distance ( cpd ) is derived for lattice constellations .",
    "we then show that , for lattice constellations , gciods have higher coding gain as compared to glcods .",
    "simulation results are also included for completeness . the maximum mutual information ( mmi ) of gciods is then derived and compared with that of glcods to show that , except for @xmath0 , ciods have higher mmi . in short",
    ", this section shows that , except for @xmath0 ( the alamouti code ) , ciods are better than glcods in terms of rate , coding gain and mmi .    in section [ fastsdd ]",
    ", we study stbcs for use in rapid - fading channels by giving a matrix representation of the multi - antenna rapid - fading channels .",
    "the emphasis is on finding stbcs that allow single - symbol decoding for both quasi - static and rapid - fading channels as ber performance such stbcs will be invariant to any channel variations .",
    "therefore , we characterize all linear stbcs that allow single - symbol ml decoding when used in rapid - fading channels . then , among these we identify those with full - diversity , i.e. , those with diversity @xmath15 when the stbc is of size @xmath16 , where @xmath14 is the number of transmit antennas and @xmath15 is the length of the code .",

    "( it turns out that alamouti code is not sd for rapid - fading channels . ) finally , section [ conc ] consists of some concluding remarks and a couple of directions for further research .",
    "in this section we present the channel model and review the design criteria for both quasi - static and rapid - fading channels .",
    "let the number of transmit antennas be @xmath14 and the number of receive antennas be @xmath18 .",

    "assuming that perfect channel state information ( csi ) is available at the receiver , the decision rule for ml decoding is to minimize the metric @xmath28 over all codewords .",
    "this results in exponential decoding complexity , because of the joint decision on all the symbols @xmath29 in the matrix @xmath30 .",
    "if the throughput rate of such a scheme is @xmath8 in bits / sec / hz , then @xmath31 metric calculations are required ; one for each possible transmission matrix @xmath30 . even for modest antenna configurations and rates this could be very large resulting in search for codes that admit a simple decoding while providing full diversity gain .      for quasi - static fading channels @xmath32 and ( [ c5chmod1 ] ) can be written in matrix notation as , @xmath33 in matrix notation , @xmath34 where @xmath35 ( @xmath36 denotes the complex field ) is the received signal matrix , @xmath37 is the transmission matrix ( codeword matrix ) , @xmath38 denotes the channel matrix and @xmath39 has entries that are gaussian distributed with zero mean and unit variance and also are temporally and spatially white . in @xmath40 and",

    "( essentially , the distance criterion implies that if a codeword is viewed as a @xmath15 length vector with each row of the transmission matrix viewed as a single element of @xmath58 , then the diversity gain is equal to the hamming distance of this @xmath15 length codeword over @xmath58 . *",
    "the product criterion : let @xmath59 be the indices of the non - zero rows of @xmath60 and let@xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the @xmath19-th row of @xmath51 , @xmath63 .",

    "consequently , * classification of non - square rfsdd , ufsdd is an open problem . in - fact",
    "complete classification of rfsdds appears to be even more difficult .",

    "even the smaller problem of maximal rates ( and design ) for non - square gciod is an open problem .",
    "* the cpd of non - square lattice constellations and the gcpd for both square and non - square lattice constellations needs to be quantified .",

    "<S> space - time block codes ( stbc ) from orthogonal designs ( od ) and co - ordinate interleaved orthogonal designs ( ciod ) have been attracting wider attention due to their amenability for fast ( single - symbol ) ml decoding , and full - rate with full - rank over quasi - static fading channels . </S>",
    "<S> however , these codes are instances of single - symbol decodable codes and it is natural to ask , if there exist codes other than stbcs form ods and ciods that allow single - symbol decoding ?    in this paper , the above question is answered in the affirmative by characterizing all linear stbcs , that allow single - symbol ml decoding ( not necessarily full - diversity ) over quasi - static fading channels - calling them single - symbol decodable designs ( sdd ) . </S>",
    "<S> the class sdd includes ods and ciods as proper subclasses . </S>",
    "<S> further , among the sdd , a class of those that offer full - diversity , called full - rank sdd ( fsdd ) are characterized and classified .    </S>",
    "<S> we then concentrate on square designs and derive the maximal rate for square fsdds using a constructional proof . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that ( i ) except for @xmath0 , square complex ods are not maximal rate and ( ii ) square fsdd exist only for 2 and 4 transmit antennas . for non - square designs , </S>",
    "<S> generalized co - ordinate - interleaved orthogonal designs ( a superset of ciods ) are presented and analyzed .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , for rapid - fading channels an equivalent matrix channel representation is developed , which allows the results of quasi - static fading channels to be applied to rapid - fading channels . using this representation </S>",
    "<S> we show that for rapid - fading channels the rate of single - symbol decodable stbcs are independent of the number of transmit antennas and inversely proportional to the block - length of the code . </S>",
    "<S> significantly , the ciod for two transmit antennas is the only stbc that is single - symbol decodable over both quasi - static and rapid - fading channels .    </S>",
