    "dirac fermions are spin 1/2 particles described by the basic equation of the relativistic quantum mechanics , i.e. , the dirac equation .",
    "since it is based on the special relativity , the dirac equation is invariant under lorentz transformation .",
    "dirac fermions are described by four - component spinors , and their components correspond to positive and negative energy and spin degrees of freedom . when the mass of a dirac fermion is nonzero , the four - component representation is irreducible , but in the massless case , it becomes reducible to be two two - component representations .",
    "this two - component fermion is called a weyl fermion",
    ". there exists the chiral symmetry for weyl fermions , so they can be distinguished by the chirality .",
    "right - handed or left - handed weyl fermions can not exist independently , thus the number of weyl fermion is always even .",
    "this is the result of the fermion doubling theorem .",
    "@xcite    the interaction between dirac fermions and electromagnetic field is formulated in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , and the exchange of photons mediates the interaction between electrons . in qed , the speed of electron @xmath3 and light @xmath2 has the same value , and qed is the lorentz - invariant theory .",
    "the electronic states in solids are described by the bloch wave functions , and according to the band theory , the equation equivalent to the dirac equation may appear .",
    "one such example is graphene , a two - dimensional carbon sheet forming hexagonal lattice .",
    "@xcite the effective theory is described by the @xmath5 dirac hamiltonian , and dirac spectra appear at @xmath6 and @xmath7 points in the brillouin zone .",
    "another example is bismuth , which exhibits a four - component massive dirac fermion caused by spin - orbit interaction .",
    "topological insulators with inversion symmetry also have dirac spectrum on the surface .",
    "@xcite although the bulk is insulating and gapped in topological insulators , the gap closes at the quantum phase transition between topological and trivial insulators .",
    "the effective theory at the critical point is described by the @xmath8 dirac hamiltonian , and the sign change of mass @xmath9 corresponds to the phase transition .",
    "this story is experimentally confirmed in bitl(s@xmath10se@xmath11)@xmath12 by changing the concentration @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite another example is pyrochlore iridates , which are predicted to be weyl semimetals , where weyl nodes are located on the fermi surface .",
    "band calculations indicate that there are 24 ( or 8) weyl nodes exist in pyrochlore iridates .",
    "when the dirac point is located on the fermi level , the electron - electron interaction is not screened , and remains a long - range force .",
    "thus , the effective model for dirac fermion in solids has nearly equivalent form to qed .",
    "the renormalization group ( rg ) is used to deal with divergent integrals appearing in the perturbative treatment of the interaction . here",
    "we should note one important difference from qed . in the band theory ,",
    "the group velocity of electron @xmath3 is expressed by the derivative of the energy dispersion in terms of the crystal momentum , but this @xmath3 is far smaller than the speed of light in solids @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , the lorentz invariance is terribly broken in this model .",
    "the smallness of the factor @xmath14 naturally leads to the choice of coulomb gauge , where the scalar potential gives the instantaneous coulomb interaction while the transverse part of the vector potential is often neglected .",
    "the effects of electron - electron interaction on the dirac electrons are extensively studied .",
    "@xcite the rg analysis of dirac electrons considering spontaneous coulomb interaction in two- and three - dimensions @xcite reveals the logarithmic divergence of @xmath3 , while the coupling constant @xmath1 is marginally irrelevant .",
    "@xmath2 is not renormalized , and stays constant .",
    "the divergence of @xmath3 makes the factor @xmath14 larger , and the contribution from the vector potential can not be ignored . when the contribution from the vector potential is considered for two - dimensional ( 2d ) system , @xmath3 saturates to @xmath2 while @xmath2 remains unchanged , and lorentz invariance is recovered in the low - energy limit .",
    "@xcite for 3d system , our previous study  @xcite reveals the renormalization of @xmath2 in addition to @xmath3 , and the recovery of lorentz invariance in the low - energy limit .    in this paper",
    ", we extend the analysis in three dimensions to multi - node dirac and weyl systems .",
    "the quantum critical phenomenon of topological phase transition and weyl semimetals are considered as physical realizations of such systems .",
    "the transverse current - current interaction due to the vector potential is considered as well as the instantaneous coulomb interaction .",
    "we also corrected some mistakes found in the previous study .",
    "we start with the following lagrangian : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a four - component dirac spinor with @xmath17 being the @xmath0 flavor index , and the matrix @xmath18 is defined to describe an electromagnetic interaction in a system without lorentz invariance .",
    "we use a @xmath19 metric . to separate the temporal and spatial components , we introduce a spatial index @xmath20 and @xmath21 . for the moment",
    ", we consider a massless case , i.e. , @xmath22 , which corresponds to a quantum critical point of topological insulators and weyl semimetals .",
    "the renormalization of the mass @xmath9 will be discussed later .",
    "we have dropped the @xmath23 term , i.e. , @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) in the action , which should be present in the topological insulator phase .",
    "this term , however , can be transformed into the surface term , and the sign of @xmath23 is determined by the time - reversal symmetry breaking on the surface .",
    "@xcite the topological magneto - electric effect is derived from this term , but this is beyond the scope of this present analysis , where only the bulk properties are discussed .    actually the rg analysis does not modify the @xmath23 term .",
    "it is natural since topological terms have discrete integer values , and we confirmed this fact from the following two methods : the perturbative calculation and the background field theory . in any case , the topological @xmath23 term does not alter the bulk properties . if we consider massless weyl nodes , the lagrangian has the chiral symmetry , and the four - component dirac spinor can be separated into the two - component weyl spinors with opposite chiralities .",
    "thus , the number of weyl nodes @xmath26 are twice as large as that of dirac nodes @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath27 . in the following analysis ,",
    "we treat the model in the four - component notation . if necessary",
    ", we can use the projection operator @xmath28 to separate the dirac fermion into two weyl fermions with opposite chiralities .",
