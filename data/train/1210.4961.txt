    "the indirect search for very high energy ( vhe ) @xmath1-rays resulting from the annihilation of dark matter ( dm ) particles into sm particles provides an important complement to that of direct searches for dm interactions and accelerator production experiments . among theoretical candidates for the dm particle",
    "@xcite , a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) is well - motivated since it naturally provides the measured present day cold dm density @xcite .",
    "candidates for wimp dark matter are present in many extensions of the sm of particle physics , such as supersymmetry ( susy ) @xcite or theories with extra dimensions @xcite . in such models , the wimps either decay or annihilate into standard model particles , producing either a continuum of @xmath1-rays with energies up to the dm particle mass , or monoenergetic @xmath1-ray lines .",
    "promising targets for indirect dm searches are nearby regions with high dm density .",
    "the galactic center is likely the brightest source of @xmath1-rays resulting from dm annihilations , however the detected vhe @xmath1-ray emission is coincident with the supermassive black hole sgr a@xmath2 and a nearby pulsar wind nebula @xcite , motivating searches for dm annihilation in the galactic center halo where the vhe @xmath1-ray background is expected to be significantly lower @xcite .",
    "alternatively , dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) of the milky way are attractive targets for dm searches .",
    "this is due to their relatively well - constrained dm profiles derived from stellar kinematics , proximity of 20100 kpc , and general lack of active or recent star formation , suggesting a relatively low background from conventional astrophysical vhe processes @xcite .",
    "here we present results for a search of dm annihilation signal from five dsphs observed with veritas .",
    "veritas is an array of four imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) , each 12 m in diameter , located at the fred lawrence whipple observatory in southern arizona , usa . each veritas camera contains 499 pixels ( 0.15@xmath3 diameter ) and has a field of view of 3.5@xmath3 . in the summer of 2009",
    "the first telescope was moved to its current location in the array to provide a more uniform distance between telescopes , improving the sensitivity of the system @xcite .",
    "veritas is sensitive over an energy range of 100 gev to 30 tev with an energy resolution of 15%20% and an angular resolution ( 68% containment ) of less than 0.1@xmath3 per event .",
    "a source with a 1% crab nebula flux can be detected by veritas in approximately 25 hours .",
    "table [ tableobs ] lists the veritas observations of dsphs .",
    "data - quality selection requires clear atmospheric conditions , based on infrared sky temperature measurements , and nominal hardware operation .",
    "the total exposures after dead time correction for each dsph are listed in table [ tableobs ] .",
    "the observations of draco , ursa minor , willman 1 , and botes 1 were taken before the first telescope was moved , while the segue 1 data was taken in the current array layout .",
    "all data were taken during moon - less periods in wobble mode with pointings of 0.5@xmath3 offset @xcite .",
    "data reduction followed the standard methods , yelding consistent results with two analysis packages @xcite .",
    ".veritas observations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsph ) . [ cols=\"<,^,<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "as listed in table [ tableobs ] , no significant vhe @xmath1-ray signal is detected from the dsph observed by veritas .",
    "upper limits ( ul ) on the integrated flux are calculated based on the assumption that the dominant source of @xmath1-rays is dm annihilation .",
    "the @xmath1-ray differential energy spectrum from dm particle annihilation depends on the dm model , in particular on the branching ratios to the final state particles . in almost every channel ( excepting the @xmath4 and @xmath5 channels ) , the @xmath1-ray emission mostly originates from the hadronization of the final state particles , with the subsequent production and decay of neutral pions .",
    "annihilation to three different final state products is considered independently of the dark matter model , in each case with a 100% branching ratio .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] ( left ) shows the annihilation spectra for the channels @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 . for each channel ,",
    "the @xmath1-ray spectrum has been simulated with the particle physics event generator pythia 8.1 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] ( right ) shows the uls ( 95% cl ) on the integrated flux above @xmath9 gev from veritas observations of segue 1 as a function of the dm particle mass .",
    "the integrated flux uls range between 0.3% and 0.7% of the crab nebula integral flux , depending on the dm particle mass .    , @xmath10 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 ) , extracted from pythia 8.1 .",
    "* right : * upper limits ( 95% cl ) on the integrated @xmath1-ray flux above @xmath9 gev from the veritas observations of segue 1 considering dark matter particle annihilation / decay for three different channels : @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 . @xcite . ]",
    "the @xmath1-ray flux from the annihilation of dm particles in a spherical dm halo is determined in part by j(@xmath11 ) , the squared dm density integrated along the line of sight and over a solid angle given by the size of the signal search region defined in the veritas analysis .",
    "the estimate of j(@xmath11 ) requires a modeling of the dsph dm profile , which for the observations of segue 1 an einasto profile @xcite is applied , resulting in j(@xmath11 ) @xmath12 gev@xmath13 @xmath14 sr . the upper limit ( ul ) on the total velocity - weighted annihilation cross - section @xmath15",
    "is then calculated using the ul on @xmath1-like events n@xmath16 , the total observation time t@xmath17 and the effective area a@xmath18 for the dataset , and the dm mass m@xmath19 : @xmath20    the main uncertainties in the dm limits computed here are from the modeling of the dm density profile . unlike the classical dsphs , there is no high - statistics star sample for segue 1 .",
    "this prevents an accurate modeling of the dm distribution . assuming an einasto profile @xcite , the systematic uncertainties in the dark matter profile modeling can change the astrophysical factor , and hence they scale up or down the limits by a factor of 4 at the 1 @xmath21 level @xcite .",
    "future spectroscopic surveys should increase the segue 1 star sample and eventually reduce the uncertainties on its dark matter content .     as a function of the wimp mass , considering different final state particles .",
