    "knowledge retrieval from large data sets remains an essential problem in information technology and its many usages in finance , biology , economy and social sciences .",
    "the data is often recorded in binary tables with rows consisting of the objects and columns of the attributes , that mark whether a particular object has or does not have a particular attribute .",
    "the dependencies existing between the subsets of the attributes in the form of association rules , or implications , can uncover the laws , causalities and trends hidden in the data ; see r. agrawal et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "an implication @xmath1 ( also referred to as a strong association rule in data mining , see m. kryszkiewicz @xcite , with parameter of confidence equal to 1 ) has the meaning that every object in the data set that possesses each attribute in the subset x will also possess every attribute from the set @xmath2 .",
    "such implications provide an essential hidden connection between different attributes .",
    "sets of implications which are called bases provide an alternative way of storing the tabled data : they generate all possible implications that hold in the set of attributes , as their logical consequences , and also allow the restoration of the tabled data . sometimes , only the implications @xmath3 pertinent to a distinguished attribute @xmath4 could be of particular importance in various experiments that produce tabled data",
    ".    one particular type of a table could be medical data where @xmath4 may stand for a phenotypic attribute , while other attributes are the expression levels of specific genes .",
    "then each association rule may represent a specific hypothesis of how the expression of several genes directly impacts the expression of another gene , and via a chain of direct interactions , indirectly impacts the phenotypic variation .",
    "biologists may then pick some of these hypotheses to verify the interactions with the inventory of biochemical methods or animal models . to discriminate between the rules that are biologically relevant and those that are",
    "not , the concept of the support of the rule @xmath3 may be applied , which is a portion of the rows of the table where all attributes from x are present .",
    "the rules with the highest support could be the targets of prime interest .    in this paper",
    "we propose a novel algorithm for the retrieval of the strong association rules between the sets of attributes in large binary tables , which is particularly suited for retrieval of targeted implications @xmath3 with a fixed attribute @xmath4 . at the heart of the algorithm",
    "lies the connection between an arbitrary binary table and an associated algebraic structure known as a galois lattice . a generating set of strong association rules , called a basis , often gives a more concise representation of the tabled data and its galois lattice .",
    "nevertheless , the existing algorithms developed in the framework of formal concept analysis ( fca ) are time - exponential in the size of the table , and they become ineffective on large data sets .    our approach retrieves a complete generating set of implications known as the @xmath0-basis , that was introduced and tested in k. adaricheva et al .  @xcite .",
    "this new type of basis is amenable to parallel processing , and can be used to find the rules that target a particular attribute without constructing the entire galois lattice .",
    "significantly , it employs the powerful optimization algorithm known as the hypergraph dualization , see m. fredman and l. khachiyan @xcite .",
    "similar arrpoach was used in u.  ryssel , f.  distel and d.  borchmann @xcite for the retreival of the canonical direct unit basis , of which the @xmath0-basis is a subset .",
    "the code implementations of the dualization algorithm were successfully tested on the models of the large size in e. boros et al .  @xcite .",
    "while one can employ the algorithm for arbitrary tables , it could especially be effective in tables with the number of attributes considerably larger than the number of the objects .",
    "one finds this type of data in biological studies , where the set of attributes may include millions of genetic variations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present the association rules and parameters of support and the confidence , as they are known in data mining , in section [ asso - rul ] .",
    "then we give a general overview for the galois lattices and fca methods in section [ fca ] and the hypergraph dualization algorithm in section [ hyper ] .",
    "section [ dbas ] describes the @xmath0-basis , and section [ galois ] gives the general properties of galois lattices .",
    "our main result is in section [ d - bas - table ] : an algorithm to recover the @xmath0-basis from a binary table .",
    "we demonstrate the algorithm on an example in section [ exm ] , provide some preliminary results of testing the code implementation in section [ test ] , and give an overview of the future work in section [ future ] .",
    "the leading algorithmic approach in recovery of association rules in data mining was formulated in the form of the _ apriori _ algorithm in r. agrawal et al .",
    "two parameters are essential for association rules : the thresholds of the support and the confidence .",
    "the support of any set @xmath5 of attributes is the value @xmath6 ( formally defined in section [ galois ] ) , which is essentially the number of rows of the table that have ones in all columns from @xmath5 . the set @xmath5 is called @xmath7-frequent , if the ratio of @xmath6 to the number of all rows in the table is greater than the given value of the threshold @xmath7 .",
    "the first part of the _ apriori _ algorithm aims at discovery of the maximal @xmath7-frequent sets , for a given threshold value @xmath7 .",
    "the second part of the algorithm is devoted to splitting any maximal frequent set @xmath5 into @xmath8 so that the confidence @xmath9 exceeds a given threshold @xmath10 . in this case",
    ", @xmath11 is an association rule that satisfies both thresholds @xmath7 and @xmath10 .    the time required to build maximal frequent sets , in the bottom - up way as in _ apriori _ , is asymptotically proportional to the number of frequent sets , and the latter may be exponentially larger than the number of maximal frequent sets",
    ". the number of maximal frequent sets itself may also be exponential in the size of the attributes of the table .",
    "the time required to build maximal frequent sets can be used as a norm to evaluate the complexity relative to the size of both input and output , in other words , the time delay in computation of the next maximal frequent set .    according to a result of e. boros et al .",
    "@xcite , given any subset @xmath12 of maximal frequent sets , the problem of deciding whether it is complete ( i.e. , includes all maximal sets ) is np - hard , even if the number of maximal frequent sets is exponential in the number of attributes @xmath13 , and @xmath12 is of size @xmath14 for small @xmath15 .",
    "all this makes the _ apriori _ heuristic inadequate for large data sets , in particular with many frequent sets of large size .",
    "another weakness of the _ apriori _ approach is its inability to target specific attributes in the conclusion of association rules . due to the nature of the algorithm",
    ", the decision about the splitting of a maximal frequent set into antecedent and conclusion happens in the second part of the algorithm , after the main effort on obtaining the frequent sets is already spent .",
    "see further details in section [ test ] .",
    "the path from the tabled data to frequent sets of attributes , and then to bases of implications , can be built via the galois relation existing between objects and attributes , and via the structure associated with this relation known in the algebraic literature as the galois lattice .",
    "for example , maximal frequent subsets of the attribute set , which are targeted in data mining of transaction tables , are particular elements of the galois lattice , see p.",
    "valtchev et al .",
    "@xcite , while the strong association rules ( with the confidence = 1 ) form the implicational basis of this lattice .    the first study of the galois lattice appeared in 1940 in g. birkhoff @xcite .",
    "it was developed further in m. barbut and b. monjardet @xcite , and taken into a field of its own , under the name formal concept analysis ( or fca ) , in b. ganter and r. wille @xcite .",
    "fca took off as a technical tool since the 1980s , mostly for the data visualization for various business applications .",
    "the applications range from knowledge representation and data mining to knowledge management and the semantic web , see j. poelmans et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "most recently , there were several projects in european commonwealth where fca was involved in biological studies of temporal boolean networks modeling genetic data .",
    "see , for example , @xcite .",
    "there are growing applications of galois lattices in ontology mappings @xcite and in description logics @xcite . a generalization of galois lattices , known as  pattern structures \" in b. ganter and s. kuznetsov @xcite , deals with data more complex than binary tables",
    ". some applications of these techniques can be found in c. carpineto and g. romano @xcite and m. kaytoue et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the fca approach is centered around a special implicational basis known in the literature as the canonical basis ( also stem basis , or duquenne - guigues basis ) .",
    "this basis has the minimum number of implications , and has a fundamental connection to any other basis defining a given galois lattice and/or binary table .    the attribute exploration algorithm to recover the canonical basis , developed in the fca framework ,",
    "see b. ganter @xcite , requires a search over the entire galois lattice , with respect to some linear order established on the power set of attributes . as a result",
    ", the algorithm runs in times dependent on at least the size of the galois lattice , which is normally exponential in the number of attributes .",
    "recent theoretical results suggest that existing approaches to calculation of the canonical basis may not produce algorithms with better worst - case complexity , see @xcite .    at its core ,",
    "the implications of the canonical basis are defined by recognizing pseudo - closed sets @xmath5 that are placed into the premises of implications : @xmath1 .",
    "there is no possibility to use parallel computation of pseudo - closed sets , since every new one depends on its subsets being recognized earlier in the process . moreover",
    ", it may happen that the same attribute @xmath4 will appear on the right side in several implications from the basis .",
    "thus , even if we were interested only in implications of the form @xmath3 , for this particular @xmath4 , one would need to reconstruct the whole basis .",
    "the canonical direct unit basis is discussed in k. bertet and b. monjardet @xcite as a basis unifying various definitions given to this concept in the literature . as the duquenne - guigues basis",
    ", it can be defined in the abstract framework of a general closure system on a finite set .",
    "it consists of implications @xmath3 with the property of minimality of @xmath5 with respect to set containment , for any fixed @xmath4 .",
    "in other words , no implication @xmath16 holds , where @xmath17 is a proper subset of @xmath5 .",
    "the canonical direct unit basis has considerably more implications compared to the duquenne - guigues basis , but it has a nice feature of being iteration - free basis , or direct basis .",
    "in fact , it is contained in any other direct basis defining the same closure system .",
    "section 11 of @xcite contains experimental results on the time needed to compute the closure of a randomly chosen set , in the closure systems on 6 and 7-element sets , given three bases : canonical basis of duquenne - guigues , in its unit form , the canonical direct unit basis and the @xmath0-basis . for the closure systems in these computational experiments , we found that the length of the duquenne - guigues basis was on the order of half the length of the canonical direct basis . on the other hand ,",
    "not being direct or ordered direct , it took on the order of twice as long to compute the closure as the other two .",
    "recently , u. russel et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a method of retrieval of the canonical direct unit basis that would employ the hypergraph dualization algorithm .",
    "while the actual coding applied some back - tracking and simple heuristics instead of actual implementation of dualization , the computer test results showed considerably shorter running times when compared to existing fca implementations : on a particular data table of size @xmath18 the new algorithm would return the basis of 86 implications in 0.1 sec compared to 6.5 hours of the fca implementation , and , on random tables of size @xmath19 , it spent about 1/50 of time needed for the fca algorithm .",
    "we note that the @xmath0-basis which we deal with in this paper is a subset of the canonical direct unit basis , see more details in section [ dbas ] and in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath20 be a finite set of cardinality @xmath21 . for a hypergraph ( set family ) @xmath22 , consider the family of its maximal independent subsets , i.e. , maximal subsets of @xmath20 not containing any edge of @xmath23 .",
    "the complement of a maximal independent subset is a minimal transversal of @xmath23 , i.e. , a minimal subset of @xmath20 intersecting all edges of @xmath23 .",
    "( minimal transversals are also called minimal hitting sets . )    the collection @xmath24 of minimal _ transversals _ is called the dual or transversal hypergraph of @xmath23 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath24 is a sperner hypergraph , i.e. , no edge of @xmath24 contains another edge of @xmath24 . if @xmath23 is also sperner then @xmath25 . given a sperner hypergraph ,",
    "a frequently arising task is the generation of the transversal hypergraph @xmath24 .",
    "this problem , known as dualization , can be stated as follows : + @xmath26::given a complete list of all edges of @xmath23 , and a set of minimal transversals @xmath27 , either prove that @xmath28 , or find a new transversal @xmath29 .",
    "clearly , one can generate all of the minimal transversals in @xmath24 ( equivalently , all the maximal independent sets for @xmath23 ) by initializing @xmath30 and iteratively solving the above problem @xmath31 times .",
    "since @xmath32 can be exponentially large in both @xmath33 and @xmath34 , the complexity of generating @xmath24 is customarily measured in the input and output sizes .    according to a result in @xcite",
    ", the problem @xmath26 can be solved in incremental quasi - polynomial time , i.e. , in @xmath35 time , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "moreover , @xmath24 can be generated in incremental polynomial time ( i.e. @xmath38 can be solved in time polynomial in @xmath39 , and @xmath40 ) for many classes of hypergraphs , see @xcite .",
    "the hypergraph dualization algorithm is one of various optimizations in database theory , artificial intelligence , game theory , and learning theory , to name a few .",
    "see the survey articles @xcite and @xcite , also the most complete recent account in @xcite .",
    "its efficient implementation is described and tested in l. khachiyan et al .",
    "while it was shown that the implementation achieves the same theoretical worst bound , practical experience with this implementation shows that it can be substantially faster .",
    "in particular , the code can produce , in a few hours , millions of transversals for hypergraphs with hundreds of vertices and thousands of hyper - edges .",
    "furthermore , the experiments also indicate that the delay per transversal scales almost linearly with the number of vertices and number of hyper - edges .",
    "a more recent implementation by k. murakami and t. uno @xcite not only demonstrates even better time performance , but also runs fast on large - scale inputs , for which earlier algorithms do not terminate in practical time .",
    "the idea of the @xmath0-basis comes from concept of the @xmath0-relation developed in a lattice theoretic framework .",
    "the definition of this relation goes back to the work of b. jnsson , a. day , r. freese , and j.b .",
    "nation , which showed that this relation played a critical role in the description of the structure of free lattices .",
    "see the monograph r. freese et al .",
    "the @xmath0-relation plays a key role in defining the od - graph of a finite lattice in j.b .",
    "nation @xcite , which was widely used in computer science literature .",
    "this concept was translated into the @xmath0-basis in the recent work @xcite .    essentially , the @xmath0-basis is a subset of the canonical direct unit basis that consists of implications @xmath41 ( binary part ) , as well as @xmath3 with @xmath42 , such that whenever any @xmath43 is replaced by any set @xmath2 for which @xmath44 holds for all @xmath45 , and @xmath46 does not hold , the implication no longer holds . in particular ,",
    "when @xmath47 , this also means that the implication @xmath48 fails for every proper subset @xmath49 .    for each implication",
    "@xmath50 in the @xmath0-basis , the subset @xmath5 is called a _",
    "minimal cover _ for @xmath4 , in lattice theory framework , and the @xmath0-relation is the binary relation on the base set of a closure system defined as follows : @xmath51 if @xmath52 , for some minimal cover @xmath5 for @xmath4 .    as we will see in section [ galois ] , the closure system of interest for us will be defined on the base set @xmath53 of attributes of a ( reduced , per discussion in section [ reduced ] ) binary table , which will also become the set of join irreducible elements of the galois lattice @xmath54 .",
    "we will revisit the connection between the @xmath0-relation and the @xmath0-basis in section [ connect ] .",
    "the od - graph of a finite closure system or a finite lattice is defined as a collection of all minimal covers , if any , for join irreducible elements of the lattice , together with the partially ordered set of all join irreducibles in the lattice .",
    "the latter is reflected in the _ binary _ part of the @xmath0-basis , or any other basis for the lattice .",
    "consider the lattice @xmath54 on fig.1 in section [ exm ] .",
    "the set of join irreducible elements is @xmath55 .",
    "the od - graph of the lattice contains @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is inherited from the lattice , i.e. , the non - trivial relations are @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "thus , implications @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62,@xmath63 should be either included into or follow from any set of implications defining closure system represented by @xmath54 .",
    "od - graph will also contain the minimal covers , as pairs @xmath64 , where @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath5 is a minimal cover for @xmath67 .",
    "not that @xmath68 is not a minimal cover for @xmath4 , since @xmath69 ( while @xmath70 does not hold ) and @xmath71 can be replaced by @xmath72 so that @xmath73 holds .",
    "thus , the od - graph will have only two minimal covers for @xmath4 : @xmath74 , and one minimal cover for each of @xmath75 : @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively .    finally , the @xmath0-basis is the implicational form of the od - graph and consists of implications : @xmath61 , @xmath60 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the canonical direct unit basis will have three extra implications : @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , which are not included in the @xmath0-basis .",
    "+ an important feature of the @xmath0-basis is that it is _ ordered direct _ , which means that it is iteration - free when a special ordering is imposed on the implications .",
    "for the @xmath0-basis , the ordering only requires that all binary implications @xmath85 precede all non - binary implications @xmath86 .",
    "this property of the basis has an advantage of easy parsing for the processing of its logical consequences .",
    "such processing shows faster times than the forward chaining algorithm , which is widely used in industrial logic programming , or linclosure algorithm in data bases , see @xcite , section 7 .",
    "thus it retains the important property of _ directness _ of the canonical direct unit basis , while having , on average , only a portion of implications from the latter . according to the test results in @xcite , the average number of implications in the @xmath0-basis , for closure systems on a domain of size 7 , are between 0.55 and 0.70 of the size of the canonical unit basis",
    "many data sets in computer science are presented in the form of binary tables . by a finite binary table",
    "we understand a relation @xmath87 , for the set of objects @xmath88 ( rows of the table ) and set of attributes @xmath20 ( columns of the table ) . if @xmath89 , then the position in row @xmath90 and column @xmath91 is marked by @xmath92 .",
    "this can be interpreted as meaning that object @xmath90 possesses attribute @xmath91 .",
    "otherwise , the position is marked with a @xmath93 .",
    "this table represents a galois connection , and allows us to form the corresponding galois lattice . in order to define the galois lattice",
    ", one needs to define the support function on each of the sets @xmath94 and @xmath95 with respect to @xmath96 .",
    "@xmath97 is called a support function on @xmath95 if , for every @xmath98 , @xmath99 .",
    "similarly , the support function @xmath100 is defined for all @xmath101 as @xmath102 .",
    "one may use the symbol @xmath12 for notation of both @xmath103 and @xmath104 , since it is usually clear from the context which one should be applied .",
    "the pair @xmath105 is called a _ concept _ of the relation @xmath96 , if @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "it is easy to show that if @xmath108 and @xmath109 are two concepts with @xmath110 , then @xmath111 .",
    "thus , the set of all concepts can be ordered with respect to the set containment order on their first components , or with respect to containment order of their second component , producing two partially ordered sets that are dual to each other .    moreover , each of these partially ordered sets actually forms a lattice , @xmath112 , or respectively , @xmath113 , and one may refer to one or the other ( depending on the preferences between sets @xmath88 or @xmath20 ) as the galois lattice ( _ concept lattice _ in fca ) of the relation @xmath96 .    since the structure of the galois lattice @xmath112 is fully determined by its first component ( or its dual lattice @xmath113",
    "is fully determined by its second component ) , one can establish an isomorphism between the galois lattice @xmath112 and the lattice of closed sets of a closure operator defined on @xmath95 by means of the support function .",
    "indeed , it is straightforward to show that the operator @xmath114 defined as @xmath115 for @xmath116 is , in fact , a closure operator on @xmath20 , and the closed sets with respect to @xmath117 are exactly the first components of the concepts of @xmath96 .",
    "thus , @xmath118 , where @xmath119 denotes the lattice of closed sets of a closure system @xmath120 .      there is a well - developed procedure for reducing the given relation r to a relation @xmath121 , where @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 , so that @xmath125 and @xmath126 are minimal with respect to property @xmath127 .",
    "see , for example , section 2 of @xcite , for the general theoretical outline , and section xi.3 in @xcite for algorithmic details .",

    "we can mention that the reduction of the retrieved basis can be considerable , and the size of the reduced part may depend on the number of _ binary _ implications in the basis , i.e. , implications of the form @xmath263 .",
    "for example , one of the tests on a small matrix of size @xmath264 found 9 binary implications in the basis , and the @xmath0-basis had a total of 635 implications , after 212 implications were reduced in the last phase of the algorithm .",
    "no reduction will occur if the binary part of the basis is empty : in this rare case the canonical direct basis and @xmath0-basis coincide .",

    "algorithm , we ran two types of tests . the first data set was taken from the frequent itemset mining dataset repository , publicly available at http://fimi.ua.ac.be/data/retail.dat . it was retail market basket data from an anonymous belgian retail store .",
    "we took first 90 rows converting them to a binary matrix format with size 90-by-502 and ( low ) density 0.0162 .",
    "running time was about 42 sec resulting in 104 mostly binary implications of maximal support 5 and confidence = 1 .",
    "for the _ apriori _ , we used microsoft sql server business intelligence development studio , 2008 ( data mining technique - microsoft association rules ) @xcite .",
    "the result of this run , together with setup of the input , took about 4 min 30 sec , with a considerably larger set of association rules , most of which have confidence @xmath266 .",
    "we point that apriori was designed specifically for mining association rules in retail data , and the specifically for data that is presented by large sets of item - sets .",
    "when converted to matrix form , it usually contains large number of rows ( transactions ) with comparably few columns ( number of items at sale ) , and normally has low density .    our second data set was of a different nature , where we believe our novel approach may have an edge over _",
    "apriori_.    the data - set was kindly provided by the research group of dr .",
    "g. okimoto from the university of hawaii cancer center .",
    "it contained the gene expression levels for 550 pre - selected genes , in 22 patients , some healthy and others with liver cancer .",
    "there are multiple approaches how to convert this matrix into binary format .",
    "for comparison of @xmath0-basis algorithm with apriori , one of them was taken as test data of size 22-by-1112 and density 0.4684 .",
    "columns 1111 and 1112 represent the attributes of being healthy and having cancer , correspondingly .",
    "microsoft association rules output was restricted to only 2000 frequent sets with minimum support 15 and confidence = 1 , and there were no association rules with attributes 1111 and 1112 .",
    "on the other hand , with the @xmath0-basis code we were able to reveal the equivalence of attribute 1111 to the set of 9 other attributes , and to find 14819 implications with the target attribute 1112 , whose support = 8 and the confidence at least 21/22 .",
    "recovery of the implicational basis directly relates to knowledge discovery , especially if one is concerned with the targeted set of implications in the basis .",
    "additional testing of biological data provided by the collaborators at the university of hawaii cancer center and medical group in astana , kazakhstan , were aiming at data of a larger size , and at the retrieval of specific targeted association rules .",
    "the results of this testing were recently presented at the fca conference @xcite .    from a theoretical point of view",
    ", the future plans include the generalization of the algorithm for the retrieval of association rules with the threshold of confidence @xmath267 ( see section [ asso - rul ] ) , and here some initial results are achieved , which may be implemented in the code .",
    "this will allow us to take into account the possibility of incomplete and erroneous data .",
    "on the other hand , a different approach exists which allows us to utilize the existing implementation .",
    "namely , the algorithm can be run multiple times on the proper subsets of existing sets of rows .",
    "for example , if the original data contains 100 rows , then the algorithm can be run on all subsets of 95 rows , which will result in obtaining all association rules of confidence at least @xmath268 .",
    "this can be achieved easily with the assistance of a specialist in distributed computing .",
    "as far as the goal of the current paper , theoretical results of the @xmath0-basis recovery are supported by the practical evidence tested in @xcite and initial testing presented in section [ test ] , that the recovery of the implicational basis based on the hypergraph dualization algorithm will bring a considerable cut in run - times when dealing with tabled data .",
    "this will make the new approach critical for analysis of large data sets .",
