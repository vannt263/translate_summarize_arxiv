    "since the last decade , the question of a positive correlation between sfr and stellar mass in star - forming galaxies ( sfgs ) , which is called the main sequence ( ms ) of sfgs , has been one among hot topics in the field of galaxy evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the tight correlation provides us with perspectives of how the sfgs evolve over cosmic time : they spend most of their lifetimes on the sequence and evolve along the ms .",
    "however , a small fraction of them shows starburst activities , and they deviate upwards from the ms @xcite .    during the course of hierarchical structure formation",
    ", galaxy evolution is expected to proceed in different ways in different environments .",
    "it is suggested that such environmental effects are more preferentially seen in satellite galaxies rather than in central galaxies at @xmath6 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "some environment - dependent processes such as galaxy interactions / merging and gas inflows / outflows can alter the star - formation activity in galaxies , either boosting it or truncating it . understanding the physical mechanisms of these processes is of vital importance to reveal the origin of early - type galaxies and the strong environmental dependence of galaxy properties seen in the present - day universe .    with this motivation",
    ", we have been conducting a systematic project called mahalo - subaru ( mapping h - alpha and lines of oxygen with subaru ; @xcite ) and mapping star - formation activities over a wide range of environments and across cosmic times , in particular at @xmath7 , where clusters of galaxies are just assembling and galaxies are forming vigorously therein .",
    "the project has shown that integrated sfr per dynamical mass in cluster core increases dramatically with redshift up to @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite show that the location of the ms of sfgs in a proto - cluster ( pks1138262 ) at @xmath8 is not different from that in the general field at similar redshifts , although the distribution of galaxies along the ms is skewed to higher sfrs and stellar masses in high density regions probably due to biased , more advanced galaxy formation there .",
    "since our analyses have been limited to relatively massive galaxies ( @xmath9 ) so far , we want to extend such study to an even less massive regime .    for this purpose , we target a proto - cluster around the uss  1558 - 003 radio galaxy at @xmath10 .",
    "* hereafter 12 ) have already reported a narrow - band  emission line survey as a part of mahalo - subaru .",
    "this previous observation has identified as many as 68 haes associated with the proto - cluster within a 27 arcmin@xmath11 field of view ( fov ) .",
    "it shows a linear filamentary structure which hosts three dense groups of haes .",
    "the richness and high density make it a unique proto - cluster target at @xmath12 for us to investigate the early environmental effects in the galaxy - formation phase .",
    "to access less massive galaxies in the cluster , we have conducted very deep follow - up observations : one is three times deeper narrow - band  imaging with subaru telescope .",
    "another is deep hst / wfc3 imaging at near - infrared . in this _ letter _",
    ", based on these new unique imaging data - sets , we report the first intriguing discovery of the nature of the less massive sfgs ( @xmath13 ) in this proto - cluster uss  1558 - 003 at @xmath10 , which has become accessible only with these deep observations",

    "all of the @xmath20 , @xmath22 , and nb2315 data are re - reduced in a standard manner using the data reduction package for moircs ( mcsred ver.20150619 by i.  tanaka ) .",

    "observations with wfc3/hst in @xmath24 are conducted on july 5 and 9 in 2014 ( go-13291 , pi : m.  hayashi ) .",
    "three pointings with wfc3 are required to cover the structures found in 12 ( figure  [ fig : map ] ) .",
    "since it took two orbits for the observations in each pointing , the integration times are 5224 sec in total ( table  [ table : data ] ) .",
    "the reduction is carried out in a standard manner with pipeline . using the task , multidrizzle ,",
    "the pixel scale is changed to 0.06 arcsec per pixel @xcite .    to summarize , the data - set that we use consists of six broad - band data ( @xmath25 and @xmath22 ) and the narrow - band ( nb2315 ) data with subaru , and the @xmath21 data with hst / wfc3 .",
    "the @xmath20 , @xmath22 , and nb2315 images are deeper by 0.67 , 0.84 and 0.89 mag .  than those in 12 ( table  [ table : data ] ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     the photometric catalog is updated by taking the same procedures on the latest data set as in 12 .",
    "however , since the hst image has much better psf than that of the subaru images ( table  [ table : data ] ) , source detection and photometry on the hst image are conducted independently .",
    "the hst and subaru photometric catalogs are then combined by matching the detected objects within a 0.5  radius circle .",
    "a procedure to select emission line galaxies is basically the same as in 12 , but we redo the selection based on the updated catalog .",
    "first , we extract galaxies with more than 3@xmath26 excess in @xmath22-nb2315 color ( left panel of figure  [ fig : selection ] ) .",
    "note that a correction of 0.1 mag .  in @xmath22-nb2315 color is required as a color term in estimating a continuum level underneath the  emission line , because there is a difference of 0.163  in the effective wavelengths between @xmath22 and nb2315 filters .",
    "we also apply the criterion of @xmath22nb2315@xmath270.50 .",
    "these criteria allow us to select 171 nb2315 emitters with line fluxes larger than 1.1@xmath2310@xmath28 erg s@xmath2 @xmath29 and equivalent widths in the observed frame larger than 66 .",
    "the limiting line flux corresponds to l(+)=@xmath30 erg s@xmath2 which turns out to be 2.4 times deeper than that in 12 .",
    "it can be converted to a dust - free sfr of 2.2  yr@xmath2 @xcite , where the contribution of  to the line flux measured with nb , i.e.  /(+ ) , is assumed to be 0.25 @xcite .    to eliminate lower-@xmath31 contaminant lines from the nb2315 emitter sample",
    ", we use the same color selection criteria as in 12 on the color  color diagram , @xmath32 versus @xmath33 ( middle panel of figure  [ fig : selection ] ) .",
    "however , some emitters are not securely detected in @xmath18 , @xmath20 , or @xmath22 , and we notice that almost all such galaxies are very faint in @xmath20 and @xmath22 . for many cases , we are thus not able to classify them according to color selection .",
    "we regard them as ` possible  emitters ' .",
    "this may be justified by our suprime - cam / subaru observation with nb428 narrow - band filter targeting  emitters at the same redshift , which shows that most of the  emitters are not detected or very faint ( @xmath343@xmath26 ) in @xmath20 and/or @xmath22 ( shimakawa et al .",
    "submitted ) .",
    "we have also found three contaminant  emitters at @xmath35 in the follow - up spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "this suggests a necessity of applying an additional color selection to distinguish  and  at @xmath35 from  at @xmath0 .",
    "we thus utilize the @xmath36 versus @xmath37 diagram as well for galaxies whose hst @xmath21 data are available .",
    "the deep hst @xmath21 photometries correspond to a bluer side of the balmer/4000  break for galaxies at @xmath35 .",
    "we set the boundary at ( @xmath36 ) = 0.324 ( @xmath37 ) + 1.2 based on the colors of the spectroscopically confirmed haes to distinguish the two populations ( right panel of figure  [ fig : selection ] ) .",
    "the slope of the criterion is parallel to a reddening vector estimated from the dust extinction curve of @xcite .",
    "we note that color tracks modelled using the @xcite stellar population synthesis code also support the @xmath38 selection criterion .",
    "the @xmath38 color selection identifies four emitters as galaxies at @xmath35 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath17-band magnitudes of  emitters at @xmath35 are more sensitive to attenuation by neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium than haes at @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "non - detection or faint magnitude in @xmath17 imply that the galaxies are more likely to be located at @xmath39 .",
    "thus , among the haes without spectroscopic confirmation and possible haes , 15 emitters without a detection at more than @xmath40 in @xmath17 or with @xmath41 are excluded from the samples .",
    "note that all of the confirmed haes , except for one galaxy , have @xmath42 .",
    "we also note that 98% of the haes are detected in @xmath18-band at 2@xmath26 level , which suggests that there is little contamination of  emission at @xmath43 .",
    "consequently , by applying these color selections , we select 91 haes and nine possible haes in total ( figures  [ fig : map ] and [ fig : selection ] ) . hereafter , we treat both haes and possible haes as sfgs at @xmath0 . comparing with the sample of 12 , the number of haes increases from 68 to 100 , due to deeper nb2315 and @xmath22 images available in this study .",
    "the symbols are the same as in figure  [ fig : selection ] .",
    "the error bars are derived from the 1@xmath26 photometric error .",
    "the uncertainties of stellar masses derived from the sed fitting are estimated from a standard deviation of 100 iterations .",
    "pentagons show the median sfrs in each mass bin .",
    "the gray region shows the sfrs under the limit reachable .",
    "the curves are mss from the literature @xcite .",
    "a gray line shows a constant specific sfr of @xmath44 yr@xmath2 , and an arrow roughly shows the stellar mass limit which is estimated with the 3@xmath26 limiting magnitude in @xmath22 and @xmath33 color of 0.36 ( 12 ) .",
    "[ fig : ms],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we estimate stellar masses of the haes by fitting a library of evolutionary stellar population synthesis models ( galaxev , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to spectral energy distribution ( sed ) with the six broad bands .",
    "the seds are hardly affected by nebular emission lines , because none of the strong lines but  enter the broad bands . in modelling",
    ", we fix the redshift to the spectroscopic one , if available .",
    "otherwise , we use the redshift of the radio galaxy ( @xmath10 )",
    ". we assume exponentially declining and constant star - formation histories .",
    "acceptable ages are chosen from 50 myr to the age of the universe at that redshift .",
    "stellar metallicities of @xmath45 or @xmath46 are applied , which are consistent with gas - phase metallicities of the haes measured by @xcite .",
    "a dust extinction curve by @xcite is assumed and @xmath47 ranges from 0.0 to 3.0 .",
    "even if galaxies are faint in @xmath20 or @xmath22 , thanks to the deep @xmath21 and optical bands , a model sed is determined for most of the haes . however , 10 haes are not fitted by any of the model seds . in those cases",
    ", we estimate the stellar masses based on their @xmath22 magnitudes corrected for the mass - to - luminosity ratio ( /@xmath48 ) measured from their @xmath33 colors ( 12 , * ? ? ?",
    "we note that for the galaxies with seds available , the stellar masses derived from @xmath22 and @xmath33 are consistent with those determined by the sed fitting .",
    "next , we estimate sfrs of the haes using the  luminosities derived from the narrow - band ( nb2315 ) imaging ( see 12 for more details ) . the contribution of  is removed from the line flux by assuming the relation between the ratio of /  and the rest - frame equivalent width of ew@xmath49(+ ) given by @xcite",
    ". if the spectroscopic redshift is available , we correct the  flux for the transmission of the nb filter at the wavelength of the line .",
    "we then correct for dust extinction using the calibration by @xcite which estimates a ( ) from the observed sfr(uv)/sfr ( ) ratio and the stellar mass , where the @xmath50 of a ( ) in the calibration is 0.282 mag @xcite .",
    "we use @xmath18-band magnitudes ( i.e , rest - frame 1795 ) to estimate the rest - frame uv luminosity densities .",
    "the intrinsic  luminosities thus derived are converted to sfrs using the @xcite calibration .",
    "figure [ fig : ms ] shows a positive correlation between sfr and stellar mass for the 100 haes , confirming the existence of the ms of sfgs .",
    "the shaded region in gray in figure [ fig : ms ] shows our limit in sfr .",
    "this limiting sfr indicates that our data are deep enough for us to discuss the ms for sfgs fully down to stellar masses of @xmath51  and we can still reach the upper half of the ms galaxies down to @xmath52 . at the lowest mass regime of @xmath53 , we would no longer be able to access the ms galaxies if the sequence is extrapolated to the low mass , and we could see only the sfgs with enhanced star - formation activities above the ms .",
    "until now , there have been a number of previous studies that investigated the ms of sfgs at @xmath54 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "figure [ fig : ms ] also compares the mss derived from the previous studies .",
    "our haes with stellar masses of @xmath55  seem to be located right on the previously measured mss in the literature @xcite .",
    "since these previous studies mainly look at galaxies in the general fields , the agreement suggests that sfgs in the proto - cluster at @xmath0 share the same ms as field sfgs at similar redshifts , consistent with the previous studies @xcite .    on the other hand , at lower stellar masses ( @xmath56 ) in the proto - cluster",
    ", there are several galaxies that are significantly up - scattered above the mss .",
    "if such small mass galaxies all follow the same extrapolated ms , they would be all located below our detection limit and we would not see any of them , contrary to what we actually see . although we can not discuss the exact locations of the ms at @xmath56  due to incompleteness , we argue that there are at least some haes that are significantly deviated upward from the ms .",
    "those more than 10 up - scattered haes at @xmath56  have exceptionally large specific sfrs ( ssfr = sfr/ ) above 10@xmath57 yr@xmath2 as shown by the light solid line in figure  [ fig : ms ] .",
    "this indicates that their inferred ages ( timescales of star formation ) are smaller than 10@xmath58 years , and they are young starbursting galaxies just being formed .",
    "note that this result is not affected by dust corrections , because the amount of dust correction is progressively lower for less massive galaxies @xcite . in fact , the inferred a ( ) for almost all of the galaxies with @xmath59  are smaller than 0.2 mag .",
    "even if we use the rest - frame uv luminosities to derive sfrs of the haes instead of  luminosities , we also find the existence of haes above the ms at the faint end .",
    "our results suggest that while the majority of massive galaxies are already settled in a secular evolution phase and are thus found on the ms , some less massive galaxies are in a starburst phase and they are significantly up - scattered from the ms",
    ". this may be consistent with the down - sizing scenario of mass - dependent galaxy evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or since they are located in a dense proto - cluster , they may be experiencing some influences from the surrounding environment such as galaxy - galaxy interactions .",
    "we do not know , however , if this trend is seen only in high density regions or it is a common feature of less massive sfgs ( traced by ) irrespective of environment .",
    "the sed fitting described in  [ sec : ms ] indicates that the youngest age of @xmath60 yr is preferred for galaxies with stellar mass less than @xmath61 , which is again consistent with the less massive haes having ssfr of @xmath62 yr@xmath2 .",
    "this also supports our interpretation that they are young , star - bursting galaxies during the vigorous formation / assembly epoch of a rich galaxy cluster .",
    "@xcite show the lack of galaxies with stellar mass less than @xmath51  in a proto - cluster at @xmath63 , and argue that it is possibly due to either a large dust extinction of less massive galaxies or the earlier formation of massive galaxies .",
    "however , our results show that there are sfgs on the ms down to stellar mass of @xmath64  and that even at lower mass bin there are sfgs with sfrs comparable to those of more massive galaxies with @xmath65 , which are not in agreement with the results by @xcite . compared to the uss1558 , the proto - cluster discussed in @xcite is not very rich , although it shows some overdensity in contrast to the general fields .",
    "therefore , the discrepant result between this _ letter _ and @xcite could be due to the intrinsic diversity of the properties of proto - clusters at @xmath0 .",
    "however , to address this issue , it is essential for us to investigate a much larger sample of proto - clusters .",
    "the existence of the less massive haes with @xmath56  up - scattered above the ms may imply that a scatter around the ms increases at lower stellar masses .",
    "diversity of star - formation history in early phase of galaxy evolution and/or sensitivity to the fluctuation of starburst activity at short time scales in individual  regions could cause the increased scatter .",
    "another possible remaining issue is a metallicity dependence of the  luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a lower stellar metallicity would result in a higher stellar temperature , and thus the larger number of ionizing photons .",
    "therefore , the sfrs for less massive galaxies can be overestimated due to the metallicity effect , if they follow the mass - metallicity relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
