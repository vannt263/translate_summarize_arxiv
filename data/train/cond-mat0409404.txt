    "in condensed matter and statistical physics the renormalization group ( rg ) in the form developed by wilson and coauthors @xcite has been very successful . at the heart of this intuitively appealing formulation of the rg",
    "lies the concept of an effective action describing the physical properties of a system at a coarse grained scale .",
    "conceptually , the derivation of this effective action is rather simple provided the theory can be formulated in terms of a functional integral : one simply integrates out the degrees of freedom describing short - wavelength fluctuations in a certain regime , and subsequently rescales the remaining degrees of freedom in order to compare the new effective action with the original one .",
    "of course , in practice , the necessary functional integration can almost never be performed analytically , so that one has to resort to some approximate procedure.@xcite however , if the elimination of the short wavelength modes is performed in infinitesimal steps , one can write down a formally exact rg flow equation describing the change of the effective action due to mode elimination and rescaling",
    ". the earliest version of such a functional rg equation has been derived by wegner and houghton.@xcite subsequently , many authors have derived alternative versions of the functional rg with the same physical content , using different types of generating functionals . in particular ,",
    "the advantages of working with the generating functional of the one - particle irreducible vertices have been realized early on by di castro , jona - lasinio , and peliti,@xcite and by nicoll , chang , and stanley.@xcite the focus of the above works was an accurate description of second - order phase transitions at finite temperatures , where quantum mechanics is irrelevant .    in recent years",
    ", there has been much interest in quantum systems exhibiting phase transitions as a function of some nonthermal control parameter , such as pressure or density . in a pioneering paper ,",
    "hertz @xcite showed how the powerful machinery of the wilsonian rg can be generalized to study quantum critical phenomena in fermi systems .",
    "technically , this is achieved with the help of so - called hubbard - stratonovich transformations , which replace the fermionic two - particle interaction by a suitable bosonic field that couples to a quadratic form in the fermion operators.@xcite the fermions can then be integrated out in a formally exact way , resulting in an effective action for the bosonic field .",
    "of course , there are many possible ways of decoupling fermionic two - body interactions by means of hubbard - stratonovich transformations . in the spirit of the usual ginzburg - landau - wilson approach to classical critical phenomena ,",
    "one tries to construct the effective bosonic theory such that the field can be identified with the fluctuating order parameter , or its field conjugate .",
    "however , if the system supports additional soft modes that couple to the order parameter,@xcite an attempt to construct an effective field theory in terms of the order parameter alone leads in general to an effective action with singular and nonlocal vertices , so that the usual rg methods developed for classical phase transitions can not be applied . in this case",
    ", it is better to construct an effective action involving all soft modes explicitly .",
    "however , for a given problem the nature of the soft modes is not known _ a priori _ , so that the explicit introduction of the corresponding degrees of freedom by means of a suitable hubbard - stratonovich transformation is always based on some prejudice about the nature of the ground state and the low - lying excitations of the system .",
    "recently , the breakdown of simple ginzburg - landau - wilson theory has also been discussed in the context of quantum antiferromagnets by senthil _",
    "et  al._@xcite    in order to have a completely unbiased rg approach for interacting fermions , one can also apply the wilsonian rg directly to the grassmannian functional integral representation of the partition function or the green s functions of an interacting fermi system.@xcite in the past ten years , several groups have further developed this method.@xcite in particular , the mode elimination step of the rg transformation has been elegantly cast into formally exact differential equations for suitably defined generating functionals .",
    "these functional equations then translate to an infinite hierarchy of integrodifferential equations for the vertices . on a technical level , it is often advantageous to work with the generating functional of the one - particle irreducible vertices.@xcite for classical field theories the exact rg flow equation for this generating functional has been obtained by wetterich,@xcite and by morris.@xcite for nonrelativistic fermions , the corresponding flow equation has been derived by salmhofer and honerkamp @xcite and , independently and in more explicit form , by kopietz and busche.@xcite    however , the purely fermionic formulation of the wilsonian rg has several disadvantages . in order to obtain at least an approximate solution of the formally exact hierarchy of rg flow equations for the vertices , severe truncations have to be made , which can only be justified as long as the fermionic four - point vertex ( i.e. , the effective interaction ) remains small .",
    "hence , in practice the fermionic functional rg is restricted to the weak coupling regime , so that possible strong coupling fixed points are not accessible within this method .",
    "usually , one - loop truncated rg equations are iterated until at least one of the marginal interaction constants becomes large , which is then interpreted as a weak - coupling instability of the fermi system in the corresponding channel.@xcite    within the framework of the wilsonian functional rg , a consistent two - loop calculation has not been performed so far due to the immense technical difficulties involved .",
    "such a calculation should also take into account the frequency dependence of the effective interaction and the self - energy corrections to the internal green s functions .",
    "note that in the work by katanin and kampf @xcite the frequency dependence of the effective interaction has been ignored , so that the effect of possible bosonic collective modes is not included in these calculations .",
    "it is well known that two - loop calculations are more conveniently performed using the field - theoretical rg method , provided the physical problem of interest can be mapped onto a renormalizable field theory .",
    "ferraz and coauthors @xcite recently used the field - theoretical rg to calculate the single - particle green function at the two loop level for a special two - dimensional fermi system with a flat fermi surface .",
    "interestingly , they found a new non - fermi liquid fixed point characterized by a finite renormalized effective interaction and a vanishing wave - function renormalization .",
    "the running interaction without wave - function renormalization diverges in this model , but the divergence is canceled by the vanishing wave - function renormalization such that the renormalized interaction remains finite .",
    "another difficulty inherent in any rg approach to fermi systems at finite densities arises from the fact that the true fermi surface of the interacting many - body system is not known _",
    "a priori_. in fact , in dimensions @xmath0 interactions can even change the symmetry of the fermi surface.@xcite in a perturbative approach , finding the renormalized fermi surface is a delicate self - consistency problem @xcite ; if one starts from the wrong fermi surface one usually encounters unphysical singularities.@xcite so far , the self - consistent renormalization of the fermi surface has not been included in the numerical analysis of the one - loop truncated fermionic functional rg . as shown in refs .",
    ", , and , the renormalized fermi surface can be defined as a fixed point of the rg and can in principle be calculated self - consistently entirely within the rg framework .",
    "the progress in overcoming the above difficulties inherent in the rg approach to fermions using a purely fermionic parametrization has been rather slow . in our opinion , this has a simple physical reason : the low lying excitations ( i.e. , soft modes ) of an interacting fermi system consist not only of fermionic quasiparticles , but also of bosonic collective excitations.@xcite the latter are rather difficult to describe within the purely fermionic parametrizations used in refs .  .",
    "naturally , a formulation of the functional rg where both fermionic and bosonic excitations are treated on equal footing should lead to a more convenient parametrization .",
    "such a strategy seems also natural in light of the observation by kirkpatrick , belitz , and co - workers @xcite ( see also ref .  ) that an effective low - energy and long - wavelength action with well - behaved vertices is only obtained if the soft modes are not integrated out , but appear explicitly as quantum fields .",
    "our aim in this work is to set up a functional renormalization group scheme that allows for a simultaneous treatment of fermionic as well as collective bosonic degrees of freedom .",
    "this is done by explicitly decoupling the interaction via a hubbard - stratonovich transformation in the spirit of hertz @xcite and then considering the functional renormalization group equations for the mixed field theory involving both fermionic and bosonic fields .",
    "this type of approach has been suggested previously by correia , polonyi , and richert,@xcite who studied the homogeneous electron gas by means of a gradient expansion of a functional version of a callan - symanzik equation .",
    "here , we follow the more standard approach and derive a hierarchy of flow equations for the vertex functions of our coupled fermi - bose theory .",
    "a related approach has also been developed by wetterich and coauthors.@xcite however , they discussed only a simple truncation of the exact hierarchy of rg flow equations involving an effective potential in a bosonic sector and a momentum - independent yukawa coupling .",
    "they did not pay any attention to the problem of the compatibility of the rg flow with ward identities , which play a crucial role for interacting fermions with dominant forward scattering .",
    "our procedure bridges the gap between the purely bosonic approach to quantum critical phenomena by hertz @xcite and the purely fermionic functional rg method developed in the past decade by several authors.@xcite contrary to the approach by hertz,@xcite in our approach the fermionic degrees of freedom are still present , so that the feedback of the collective bosonic modes on the one - particle spectral properties of the fermions can be studied .",
    "the parametrization of the low - lying excitations of an interacting fermi system in terms of collective bosonic fields is most natural in one spatial dimension,@xcite where fermi - liquid theory breaks down and is replaced by the luttinger - liquid concept.@xcite an exactly solvable paradigm of a luttinger liquid is the tomonaga - luttinger model ( tlm),@xcite consisting of fermions with exactly linear energy dispersion and interactions involving only small momentum transfers .",
    "a description in terms of bosonic variables is well known to provide an exact solution for thermodynamic quantities as well as correlation functions.@xcite one might then wonder if it is also possible to obtain the complete form of the correlation functions of the tlm entirely within the framework of the functional rg .",
    "an attempt @xcite to calculate the momentum- and frequency - dependent single - particle spectral function @xmath1 of the tlm by means of an approximate iterative two - loop solution of the functional rg equations at weak coupling yields the correct behavior of @xmath2 known from bosonization ( where @xmath3 is the fermi momentum ) , but yields incorrect threshold singularities for momenta away from @xmath4 . in this work",
    "we go considerably beyond ref . and show how the tlm can be solved _",
    "exactly _ using our mixed fermionic - bosonic functional rg .",
    "a crucial point of our method is that the rg can be set up in such a way that the ward identities underlying the exact solubility of the tlm @xcite are preserved by the rg .",
    "this is not the case in the purely fermionic formulation of the functional rg.@xcite    very recently , benfatto and mastropietro@xcite also developed an implementation of the rg for the tlm which takes the asymptotic ward identities into account .",
    "however , these authors did not introduce bosonic collective fields and did not attempt to calculate the exact single - particle green s function .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "[ sec:1dflow ] , we introduce a new rg scheme which uses the momentum transfer of the effective interaction as a cutoff .",
    "we show that for linearized energy dispersion the resulting infinite hierarchy of flow equations for the irreducible vertices involving two external fermion legs and an arbitrary number of external boson legs can be solved exactly by means of an infinite set of ward identities . using these identities , the flow equation for the irreducible self - energy",
    "can then be reduced to a closed linear integrodifferential equation , which can be solved exactly . in one dimension",
