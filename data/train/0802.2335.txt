    "although linear polymers in solution may be studied using continuous models , much has been learned about these systems through models of self- and mutually avoiding walks placed on lattices @xcite .",
    "the excluded volume constraint makes it quite difficult to treat these problems , even trying to answer apparently simple questions such as the number of walks with a given number of steps , which is relevant in series expansion approaches to the problem , is a challenging and rich field of research ( for a recent work in this field see @xcite ) .",
    "the connection of such models with the @xmath0-vector model of magnetism in the formal limit @xmath1 @xcite and the application of the ideas of scaling and the renormalization group to polymer systems @xcite have also been central in the development of this area of research .    if the polymer chain is placed in a poor solvent , as the temperature is decreased eventually the chain changes from an extended configuration ( in which the entropy is favored ) to a collapsed configuration ( with less contact between the polymer and the solvent and thus a smaller energy ) .",
    "the temperature where this transition happens was called @xmath2 temperature @xcite .",
    "although this transition may be modeled using lattice models where the solvent is included explicitly @xcite , these models in a certain limit lead to a simpler model which has become the standard model for this phenomenon , in which , besides the repulsive excluded volume interactions , attractive interactions between monomers on first neighbor sites but not consecutive along the chain are introduced ( isaw model ) .",
    "the configurations in this model are self - avoiding walks whose steps link monomers located on first neighbor lattice sites .",
    "the collapse transition in models which are grand - canonical with respect to the number of monomers in the system usually appears as a tricritical point in the phase diagram . in the fugacity vs. temperature phase diagram ,",
    "a non - polymerized phase is present in the region of low monomer fugacity , and a polymerized phase is stable for higher fugacities .",
    "the transition between these phases is of first order at low temperatures and becomes continuous at higher temperatures .",
    "these regimes are separated by a tricritical point , where the collapse transition occurs .",
    "the isaw model has been extensively studied on the square lattice @xcite , and the exact tricritical exponents of the diluted polymer model were found @xcite . under certain conditions ,",
    "an even richer phase diagram is found , with the presence of a dense polymerized phase at finite monomer fugacity , where the density of empty lattice sites vanishes .",
    "this additional phase was found in solutions of the model on @xmath3 husimi lattices with interactions between _ bonds _ @xcite of the polymer located on opposite sides of elementary squares of the lattice , as well as in cluster approximations of similar models on the square lattice @xcite .",
    "transfer matrix calculations on strips of finite widths support the existence of this phase on the square lattice as well @xcite .",
    "the dense phase is absent if the interactions are only between monomers , but even in this case there are indications that this phase will be present if the polymer chains are sufficiently stiff @xcite .",
    "usually , the introduction of interactions in the polymer models is a source of difficulty both in approximate solutions and in transfer - matrix approaches .",
    "thus , a model introduced recently for studying the collapse transition in polymers where only _ one - site _ interactions are present is quite interesting @xcite .",
    "this model allows for multiple occupancy of a site by up to @xmath4 monomers , assuming that the attractive interactions are restricted to monomers which occupy the same site of the lattice .",
    "one way to justify the model would be to discretize the original system of a polymer in a solution using a regular lattice , and choosing the size of the elementary cell of this lattice to be big enough to accommodate up to @xmath4 monomers of the polymer . also , the length of the bonds has to be larger than the size of the cells , so that two monomers in the same cell will never be connected by a bond .",
    "two versions of the model were studied by extensive numerical simulations in @xcite on the square and on the cubic lattice . in the ra ( immediate reversals allowed ) model , there are no restrictions on the walks on the lattice , while in the rf model ( immediate reversals forbidden ) only a subset of the possible walks is considered : those in which the walk does not return to the original site immediately after reaching a new site . in the simulations done for the rf model on the cubic lattice for @xmath5 , a transition between extended and collapsed polymerized phases is found .",
    "recently , the ra and rf models were solved on a bethe lattice for @xmath6 , in order to compare their thermodynamic behaviors with the much studied isaw model regarding the usual collapse transition @xcite .",
    "the solution of the rf model on the bethe lattice produces a phase diagram in which the polymerization transition remains continuous for small non - zero values of @xmath7 , becoming of first order at higher values of this statistical weight , a behavior which is also found in the isaw model . besides the regular polymerized phase , a second phase is stable for sufficiently high values of @xmath7 and low values of @xmath8 where only empty and double - occupied sites are present .    here",
    "the rf model is solved on a @xmath9 husimi lattice , which is the central region of a cayley tree built with squares .",
    "there are @xmath10 squares incident on each lattice site .",
    "the thermodynamic behavior of models on such a lattice is expected to be closer to the one obtained on a regular lattice with the same coordination number , and we were motivated for this calculation mainly for two reasons . although the rf model on the bethe lattice displays a tricritical point which may be associated to the usual collapse transition of polymers , if we parametrize the model such that @xmath11 , the activity of a monomer , and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the boltzmann factor associated to a pair of interacting monomers , the tricritical point is found at @xmath14 , a value that corresponds to a _ repulsive _ interaction between monomers at the same site .",
    "we are interested in finding out if a calculation which should lead to results closer to the ones on regular lattices might shift the tricritical point to the region in the parameter space which corresponds to attractive interactions . also , it is of interest to find out if the second polymerized phase is still present in the phase diagram of the model on the husimi lattice .",
    "we found that actually with a convenient parametrization the tricritical point is located in the physically expected region and that the second polymerized phase is still present in the husimi lattice solution , although it occupies a smaller region of the parameter space than the one found for the bethe lattice .    in section [ ms ]",
    "we define the model in more detail and present its solution on the husimi lattice .",
    "final discussions and the conclusion may be found in section [ con ] .",
    "we consider a husimi tree , a cayley tree built with polygons , which in our case will be squares . sometimes this tree",
    "is also called a cactus . as also happens for the cayley tree , in the thermodynamic limit the fraction of sites which are on the surface of the tree does not vanish , and this accounts for the fact that the solution of models on such trees usually shows a behavior which does not resemble the one found on regular lattices .",
    "if , however , the behavior of models in the central region of the trees is considered , for many models the exact solution corresponds to the bethe approximation of the same model on a regular lattice with the same coordination number , and this is the reason why this is called a bethe lattice solution @xcite .",
    "the husimi lattice corresponds to the central region of a cayley tree built with polygons ( squares in our case ) , and since closed paths are present ( although restricted to single elementary squares ) , it is expected that the solution of models on this tree will be closer to the one found on regular lattices , and this is confirmed in many cases .",
    "the allowed configurations of the @xmath6 rf model are walks that may visit a site one or two times , with their initial and final monomers placed only on the surface of the tree .",
    "also , as stated above , immediate reversals of the walk are forbidden . in figure [ f1 ] a possible configuration is shown on a tree with two generations of squares .",
    "the statistical weight of a configuration will be @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the numbers of sites with one and two monomers , respectively .",
    "for simplicity , the surface of the tree was chosen to be defined by sites connected to a single site of the first generation of squares . to solve the model on the husimi tree",
    ", we consider rooted subtrees , and define partial partition functions for these trees , for fixed configurations of the bonds incident on the root site .",
    "the operation of attaching three sets of @xmath18 @xmath0-generations subtrees to a new root square will result in a @xmath19-generations subtree , leading to recursion relations for the partial partition functions .",
    "notice that we decided to consider the monomers placed on the same site to be _ indistinguishable _ , in opposition to what was adopted in the solution on the bethe lattice @xcite , where they were supposed to be distinguishable .",
    "this new convention was motivated mainly by two aspects : as already observed in the discussion of the bethe lattice solution , the tricritical point of the @xmath6 rf model is located in the region in the parameter space which corresponds to _ repulsive _ interactions between monomers .",
    "if two monomers placed on the same site are considered to be indistinguishable , the weight @xmath7 will be multiplyed by a factor of 2 , and this will shift the tricritical point towards the region of attractive monomers . also , in the original simulations @xcite the configurations of a walk on the lattice are labeled by the sequence of sites visited by the walk , and this convention corresponds to indistinguishable monomers .",
    "although we do no detailed comparisons of our results with the simulations , since they were done for @xmath5 , we decided to adopt the same convention . in figure [ f2 ] the 11 configurations of the bonds incident on the root site of subtrees are depicted . for brevity , only one configuration of pairs related by reflection symmetry",
    "for example , there are a total of 4 configurations with the same partial partition function in group 7 of the figure .",
    "we notice that the connection of the incoming bonds to the monomers placed on the root site is not fixed . since we assume the monomers to be indistinguishable , to write down the recursion relations for the partial partition functions we must separate incoming double bonds in two groups : if both bonds visited the same sites since the boundary of the tree they are labeled as _ i _ ( as in configuration 5 ) , otherwise , they are labeled as _ d _ ( as in configuration 4 ) .",
    "this information is essential to allow us to correctly determine the multiplicity of the contributions to the recursion relations below .",
    "rf model on a husimi tree with square ramification @xmath20 and 2 generations .",
    "polymer bonds ( steps of the walks ) are represented by thick lines , while the lattice bonds are thin lines .",
    "the weight of this configuration is @xmath21.,height=226 ]     on the husimi lattice.,height=226 ]    we may now proceed obtaining the recursion relations for the partial partition functions .",
    "we notice that certain partial partition functions appear in the recursion relations only in linear combinations .",
    "thus , @xmath22 and @xmath23 always appear as @xmath24 , and the other linear combinations are @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "we therefore may reduce the number of independent variables in the recursion relations by 3 .",
    "the partial partition functions usually diverge in the thermodynamic limit , thus we consider the 8 ratios defined below , which often remain finite , and in the thermodynamic limit a phase of the system may be associated to a fixed point of the recursion relations for the ratios .    @xmath27    it is now convenient to define first some linear combinations of partial partition functions which appear repeatedly in the recursion relations , whose contributions are shown graphically in figure [ f3 ] for the particular ramification of squares @xmath20 .",

    "finally , we will consider the operation of attaching @xmath10 subtrees to the central site of the lattice .",
    "this operation is similar to the ones realized to obtain the recursion relations and the result is : @xmath36.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is now easy to obtain the probabilities of single and double occupancy of the central site .",
    "the results are @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "as stated above , to study the thermodynamic behavior of the model we have to find the fixed point of the recursion relations , given the statistical weights @xmath8 and @xmath7 .",
    "as expected , the ratios @xmath39 and @xmath40 vanish for all values of the statistical weights . on the husimi lattice a double chain which starts on the boundary may end at any step , by entering into a square and circulating it ( this corresponds to the contribution @xmath41 in the recursion relation [ g2p ] for @xmath42 ) . at low values of the statistical weights ,",
    "a non - polymerized phase , characterized by @xmath43 , is stable . at the fixed point associated to this phase",
    "all ratios vanish , with the exception of @xmath44 . from the recursion relations above",
    "we may find the following equation for this fixed point : @xmath45r_3 = 0.\\ ] ] at the stability limit of the np phase the largest eigenvalue of the jacobian of the recursion relations is equal to one , and this condition allowed us to obtain the region of the parameter space where the np phase is stable . for large values of the statistical weights , a regular polymerized ( rp ) phase is stable , in which the ratios @xmath46 are non - vanishing at the fixed point .",
    "finally , for small values of @xmath8 , between the regions where the np and rp phases are stable , a third phase appears , for which all ratios which correspond to an odd number of incoming bonds at the root site @xmath47 vanish .",
    "we will call this phase pp ( pair polymerized ) . in figure [ f6 ]",
    "the phase diagram of the model is presented for a lattice with @xmath3 , and we notice that the transition between the np and rp phases may be of first or second order , with a tricritical point located at @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the region where the pp phase is the most stable one is rather small and the transition between the np and pp phases is continuous .",
    "this transition line ends at a critical endpoint , which is located at @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "a discontinuous transition separates the two polymerized phases .",
    "the first order lines were obtained directly from the recursion relations , starting the iterations with ` natural ' initial conditions @xcite . in the present calculations , we considered the surface of the tree to be formed by sites connected to a single site of the next generations , as shown in figure [ f1 ] .",
    "this choice leads to the following initial values :    @xmath52    as mentioned above , the ratios @xmath39 and @xmath40 vanish in the termodynamic limit , but have nonzero values for finite lattices . if we change slightly the initial conditions , assuming the monomers placed on the surface of the tree to be distinguishable , these ratios will vanish identically and the initial value for @xmath53 would be equal to @xmath54 , with no change in the thermodynamic properties of the model within our numerical precision .    a model which is very similar to the one we are studying here was investigated recently by r. a. zara and m. pretti @xcite to study the properties of rna - like molecules , and actually the phase diagram for the husimi lattice solution of this model is similar to the one we obtain here .",
    "it may also be mentioned that no dense phase , as the ones found in some versions if the isaw model @xcite , is stable in finite regions of the parameter space .",
    "actually , such a phase is stable in a region of the @xmath55 line , but this fixed point is never reached if @xmath56 and therefore is of no physical relevance .",
    "qualitatively , the phase diagram presented here is similar to the one found for the rf model on the bethe lattice ( figure 3 of reference @xcite ) .",
    "we notice that on the bethe lattice the second order line between the np and the rp phases is located at @xmath57 , while the np - pp transition happens at @xmath58 ( @xmath59 if the monomers are considered to be indistinguishable ) .",
    "those lines are no longer parallel to one of the axes for the husimi lattice solution .",
    "the location of the tcp is not changed much in the two solutions , although the value of @xmath7 for this point on the husimi lattice solution is about 10 % larger .",
    "the cep , although localized at almost the same value of @xmath7 in the two solutions , shows a much smaller value of @xmath8 on the husimi lattice . as a consequence , the area in which the pp phase is stable in the parameter space is much smaller on the husimi lattice solution , it is an open question if this unusual phase appears if the model is considered on regular lattices . on the bethe lattice solution the pp phase",
    "was called double occupancy polymerized phase , since @xmath60 was found to vanish in this phase .",
    "we notice that in the husimi lattice solution the density of sites occupies by a single monomer does not vanish in this phase , as may be appreciated in the inset of the figure [ f7 ] , where both densities are shown as functions of @xmath7 for a fixed value of @xmath8 .    ,",
    "dashed lines ) and two ( @xmath61-full lines ) monomers , as functions of @xmath7 for @xmath62.,height=226 ]    the comparison of the model with multiple monomers per site ( mms ) with the usual isaw model is not straightforward . when @xmath63 , the mms model corresponds to the isaw model without attractive interactions .",
    "however , the mms model for @xmath6 without attractive interactions corresponds to the line @xmath64 , since we should associate a statistical weight equal to the activity @xmath65 to each monomer placed on the lattice . in the isaw model a subset of the walks considered in the mms model is allowed .",
    "if we actually imagine this model to be an effective description of a continuous model treated in a cell approximation , we might think the parameter @xmath13 to be the effective interaction found integrating the position of the two monomers inside the cell they occupy .",
    "if this interpretation is adopted , the statistical weight of a site occupied by one monomer would be @xmath11 , where @xmath65 is the activity of a monomer , while a double occupied site would contribute with a factor @xmath66 to the grand canonical partition function , where @xmath13 is the boltzmann factor associated to the interaction of two monomers . with this parametrization",
    ", the tricritical point will be located at @xmath67 , which corresponds to attractive interactions between monomers at the same site . in the bethe lattice solution for indistinguishable monomers ,",
    "the tricritical point is located at @xmath68 , which corresponds to no interaction .",
    "we also did the calculations of the model for distinguishable monomers , as was done initially for the bethe lattice . within our numerical approximation",
    ", this solution leads to a phase diagram which differs from the one presented here by a factor of 2 in the values of @xmath7 .",
    "this may be understood by noting that the recursion relations for the model with distinguishable monomers are the same ones presented here except for this factor 2 in each term proportional to @xmath7 for @xmath46 ( configurations 5 and 10 are absent in this case ) , and that the additional ratios @xmath39 and @xmath40 vanish in the fixed point for the model with indistinguishable monomers , as stated above .",
