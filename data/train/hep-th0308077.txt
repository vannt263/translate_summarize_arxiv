    "energy - momentum is an important conserved quantity whose definition has been a focus of many investigations .",
    "unfortunately , there is still no generally agreed definition of energy and momentum in general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "this dilemma in gr is highlighted in an important paper by penrose@xcite in the following way :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  it is perhaps ironic that _ energy conservation _ , paradigmatic physical concept arising initially from galileo s ( 1638 ) studies of the motion of bodies under gravity , and which now has found expression in the ( covariant ) equation    @xmath0    a cornerstone of einstein s ( 1915 ) general relativity  should nevertheless have found no universally applicable formulation , within einstein s theory , incorporating the energy of gravity itself . ",

    "the numerous attempts aimed at finding an expression for describing energy - momentum distribution due to matter , nongravitational and gravitational fields gave rise to a large number of energy - momentum complexes whose physical meaning have been questioned ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the absence of a generally accepted definition of energy distribution in curved space - times has led to doubts regarding the idea of energy localization . over the past two decades considerable effort",
    "has been put in trying to define an alternative concept of energy , the so - called quasi - local energy .",
    "the idea in this case is to determine the effective energy of a source by measurements on a two - surface .",
    "these masses are obtained over a two - surface as opposed to an integral spanning over a three - surface of a local density as is the case for pseudocomplexes . to date a large number of definitions of quasi - local mass",
    "have been proposed ( see in brown and york @xcite and hayward@xcite ) .",
    "bergqvist@xcite considered quasi - local mass definitions of komar , hawking , penrose , ludvigsen - vickers , bergqvist - ludvigsen , kulkarni _ et al .",
    "_ , and dougan - mason and concluded that no two of these definitions give agreed results for the kerr as well as reissner - nordstrm space - times . on the contrary ,",
    "the pioneering work of virbhadra and his collaborators ( notably , nathan rosen of einstein - rosen gravitational waves fame ) , and others have demonstrated with several examples that for a given spacetime , the energy - momentum complexes of einstein , landau and lifshitz , papapetrou , and weinberg ( ellpw ) , show a high degree of consistency in giving the same and acceptable energy and momentum distributions ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "_ et al__@xcite showed that the ellpw energy - momentum complexes `` coincide '' for any metric of kerr - schild class .",
    "the stationary axially symmetric and asymptotically flat electrovac kerr - newman ( kn ) solution , characterized by constant parameters mass @xmath1 , charge @xmath2 , and angular momentum @xmath3 , is the most general black hole solution to the einstein - maxwell equations .",
    "virbhadra @xcite and then following him cooperstock and richardson @xcite showed ( up to the third order and seventh order , respectively , of rotation parameter ) that the energy - momentum complexes of einstein and landau - lifshitz give the same and reasonable energy distribution in kn space - time .",
    "further aguirregabiria _",
    "@xcite performed exact computations for the energy distribution in kn space - time in kerr - schild cartesian coordinates .",
    "they showed that the energy distribution in the prescriptions of einstein , landau - lifshitz , papapetrou , and weinberg ( ellpw ) gave the same result . in this paper",
    "we investigate the energy - momentum distribution of the kerr - newman space - time using the bergmann - thomson prescription and compare the results obtained by aguirregabiria _",
    "in this section we first write the energy - momentum complex formulated by bergmann and thomson and then use it to compute energy and momentum distributions in kerr - newman spacetime .    the energy - momentum complex of bergmann - thomson is@xcite    @xmath4    where @xmath5 with @xmath6_{,m } \\ . \\label{uikl}\\ ] ] the latin indices take values @xmath7 to @xmath8 .",
    "the bergmann - thomson energy - momentum complex satisfies the local conservation laws @xmath9 in any coordinate system ; however , @xmath10 itself does not transform as a tensor under a general coordinate transformation .",
    "the energy and energy current ( momentum ) density components are respectively represented by @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "energy and momentum components @xmath13 are given by    @xmath14    using gauss s theorem one obtains energy @xmath15 and momentum components @xmath16 ( @xmath17 takes values @xmath18 to @xmath8 ) as follows :    @xmath19    the kerr - newman space - time in kerr - schild cartesian coordinates @xmath20 is expressed by the line - element@xcite :    @xmath21 ^ 2 \\text{,}\\label{knmetric}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath22 is defined by @xmath23 note that @xmath22 becomes the usual spherical radial coordinate @xmath24 for rotation parameter @xmath25 .",
    "now we use equations @xmath26 and @xmath27 to obtain energy and momentum distributions in kerr - schild cartesian coordinates . in these coordinates , all the components of the metric tensor for the kerr - newman metric are nonvanishing and also have lengthy expressions .",
    "it is extremely difficult to perform these calculations manually .",
    "therefore , we used _",
    "mathematica 4.0_@xcite for computations .",
    "the energy and momentum components inside a 2-surface with constant @xmath22 are respectively given by    @xmath28 \\label{enenrgy}\\ ] ]    and @xmath29    it is striking that bergmann - thomson complex gives the same result as found by aguirregabiria _",
    "et al._@xcite ) who used definitions proposed by einstein , landau and lifshitz , papapetrou , and weinberg .",
    "the results found by us further support the importance of the energy - momentum complexes , as these yield consistent and meaningful results .",
    "now for our convenience we define @xmath30    and plot @xmath31 against @xmath32 and @xmath33 for different values of @xmath34 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . for the same value of @xmath32 and @xmath33",
    ", @xmath31 is higher for lower values of @xmath34 .",
    "linear momentum components @xmath35 remain zero for all values of @xmath36 , and @xmath32 .",
    "this is also shown in the same figure .",
    "note that the kerr - newman represents gravitational fields of black holes for @xmath37 and of naked singularities for @xmath38 .",
    "the main weakness of energy - momentum complexes is that these restrict one to make calculations in ` cartesian coordinates ' .",
    "the alternative concept of quasi - local mass appears more attractive because these are not restricted to the use of any special coordinate system .",
    "there is a large number of quasi - local masses .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that for the kerr as well as reissner - nordstrm space - times many quasi - local mass formulations do not give agreed results . on the other hand aguirregabiria , chamorro , and",
    "virbhadra@xcite showed that the energy - momentum complexes of einstein , landau - lifshitz , papapetrou , and weinberg give the same result for any metric of kerr - schild class if the computations are carried out in kerr - schild cartesian coordinates .",
    "the well - known spacetimes of the kerr - schild class are for example the schwarzschild , reissner - nordstrm , kerr , kerr - newman , vaidya , dybney _ et al .",
    "_ , kinnersley , bonnor - vaidya and vaidya - patel .",
    "virbhadra@xcite also showed that for a general nonstatic spherically symmetric spacetime of the kerr - schild class , the ellpw give the same energy distribution as the penrose quasi - local mass definition if calculations are performed in kerr - schild cartesian coordinates .    in the previous section we showed that the bergmann - thomson energy - momentum complex gives the same energy and momentum distribution in the kerr - newman spacetime as the ellpw prescriptions .",
    "these results and the important paper of chang _ _ et al__@xcite , which dispels doubts expressed about the physical meaning of these energy - momentum complexes , give confidence to the use of energy - momentum complexes to compute energy - momentum distribution in a given spacetime .",
    "the energy expression @xmath39 in eq .",
    "@xmath40 can be treated as the effective gravitational mass that acts on a neutral ( electric charge zero ) test particle situated at a coordinate distance @xmath22 from the centre of the kerr - newman black hole .",
    "the repulsive effects of the electric charge and rotation parameters are obvious . for sufficiently small @xmath22",
    ", @xmath39 can be negative for large values of @xmath41 and @xmath3 .",
    "for reissner - nordstrm metric , @xmath42 for @xmath43 . as expected , the total energy ( @xmath44 ) of the kerr - newman metric comes to be the well - known adm mass @xmath1 .",
    "it is independent of the other two ( electric charge and rotation ) parameters of the charged rotating black hole .    a most important implication of our result ( expressed in eq .",
    "@xmath40 ) is that it supports _ cooperstock hypothesis _",
    "@xcite for energy localization , which essentially states that energy in a curved space - time is localized in the region of nonvanishing energy - momentum tensor @xmath45 of matter and non - gravitational fields . for the kerr black hole space - time @xmath46 and",
    "therefore energy is confined to exterior of the black hole ; however , for the kerr - newman black hole metric @xmath47 and the energy is distributed to the interior and exterior of the black hole .",
