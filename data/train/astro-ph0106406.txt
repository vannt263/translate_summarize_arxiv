    "there is a growing interest to understand whether a stable sequence of compact stars could exist in nature beyond a neutron star branch .",
    "> from observations , two families of compact stars - white dwarfs and neutron stars , are known to us .",
    "the physical reasons for stability in white dwarfs and neutron stars are different . in white dwarfs , it is the fermi pressure of degenerate electrons that stabilizes the stars .",
    "after the white dwarf branch , there exists no stable star having central densities in the range @xmath4 as is evident from the mass - radius relationship obtained by the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equations @xcite .",
    "the stability is regained in the neutron star branch . in this case , the fermi pressure of degenerate and interacting baryons is responsible for the stability of neutron stars .",
    "the question is what is next to a neutron star branch - again an unstable region followed by a stable configurations of super dense stars ! if this picture is true , what could be the mechanism behind the stability of a possible third family of compact stars ?",
    "gerlach @xcite first pointed out that a third family of compact stars could be a possibility .",
    "he noted that a jump in the equation of state ( eos ) or equivalently a large discontinuity in the speed of sound beyond the central density corresponding to the maximum neutron star mass might result in a stable family of super dense stars beyond the neutron star branch .",
    "however , wheeler et al . showed that there was no stable compact stars beyond a neutron star branch for a smooth eos @xcite .",
    "neutron stars are very useful laboratories to investigate the properties of dense matter @xcite . at the core of a neutron star ,",
    "the matter density could exceed by a few times normal nuclear matter density .",
    "various exotic forms of matter such as hyperonic matter , quark - hadron mixed phase and bose - einstein condensation of strange particles may appear there .",
    "earlier it was found that there might be kinks in the eos because of the appearance of an exotic form of matter in the high density regime .",
    "consequently there is a discontinuity in the speed of sound .",
    "this motivated various groups to explore whether physical processes like a first order phase transition from hadronic matter to quark matter or hadronic matter to hyperonic matter could give rise to an eos leading to a third family of compact stars @xcite .",
    "it was shown by various authors that a first order quark - hadron phase transition could produce an eos such that the neutron star branch is terminated by the softening in the eos due to the mixed phase and the third family of compact stars attained a pure quark phase in the core @xcite .",
    "similarly , a first order phase transition from hadronic matter to hyperonic matter led to stable solutions beyond the neutron star branch for certain parameters sets of hyperon - hyperon interactions @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated in those calculations that non - identical stars of same mass but distinctly different radii and compositions could exist because of partial overlapping mass regions of the neutron star branch and the third family branch .",
    "these pairs are known as `` neutron star twins '' @xcite .    besides quark - hadron phase transition and the formation of hyperonic matter",
    ", bose - einstein condensation of antikaons may occur in the @xmath2-stable and charge neutral dense matter .",
    "this antikaon condensation could be a first or second order phase transition @xcite .",
    "it was first demonstrated by kaplan and nelson @xcite using a chiral @xmath5 lagrangian that @xmath0meson may undergo bose - einstein condensation in dense hadronic matter formed in heavy ion collisions .",
    "the strongly attractive @xmath0-nucleon interaction lowers the effective mass of @xmath0 mesons in dense matter .",
    "consequently , the in - medium energy of @xmath0 mesons decreases and s - wave condensation sets in when the in - medium energy of @xmath6 mesons equals to its chemical potential . later , this chiral model was applied to the study of @xmath6 condensation in the core of neutron stars @xcite . also , the traditional meson exchange picture where baryons and ( anti)kaons interact through meson exchange , was extensively exploited to investigate antikaon condensation in dense matter relevant to ( proto)neutron stars @xcite .",
    "the onset of @xmath6 condensation in neutron star matter depends on the nuclear equation of state and also on the depth of antikaon optical potential .",
    "the threshold density of @xmath6 condensation in nucleons - only star matter is 3 - 4 times normal nuclear matter density .",
    "the net effect of @xmath0 mesons in the condensate in neutron star matter is to maintain charge neutrality replacing electrons and soften the eos resulting in the reduction of maximum mass of the star @xcite . in the presence of hyperons ,",
    "@xmath6 condensation was delayed to higher density .",
    "recently , we have investigated the formation of @xmath1 condensation along with @xmath6 condensation in dense nuclear and hyperonic matter relevant to ( proto)neutron stars within relativistic mean field ( rmf ) models @xcite .",
    "it was found that the onset of @xmath1 condensation always occurred later than that of @xmath6 condensation . with the onset of @xmath1 condensation ,",
    "abundances of neutrons and protons become equal in the high density matter @xcite . in the presence of hyperons , the thresholds of @xmath6 and @xmath1 condensation",
    "are shifted to higher densities . along with @xmath6 condensate ,",
    "@xmath1 condensate makes the eos much softer resulting in smaller maximum mass star compared to the case without any condensate .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the effects of antikaon condensation on the equation of state within a rmf model where baryons and ( anti)kaons are interacting via meson exchanges .",
    "also , we study the properties of the third family of compact stars with this eos . the paper is organised in the following way . in section 2",
    ", we describe the rmf model of strong interactions and different phases of dense matter . in section 3 ,",
    "the parameters of the model are discussed .",
    "results of our calculation and their relations to the third family of compact stars are explained in section 4 .",
    "section 5 deals with summary and conclusions .",
    "in this calculation , we describe a first order phase transition from hadronic matter to the antikaon condensed phase in compact stars . we adopt a relativistic field theoretical model to describe the pure hadronic matter , pure antikaon condensed matter and the mixed phase .",
    "the constituents of matter - @xmath7 of the baryon octet and electrons and muons , in the hadronic phase are to satisfy beta - equilibrium and local charge neutrality condition . the strong interaction between baryons",
    "is mediated by the exchange of scalar and vector mesons .",
    "the model is also extended to include hyperon- hyperon interaction through two additional hidden - strangeness mesons- scalar meson @xmath8(975 ) ( denoted hereafter as @xmath9 ) and the vector meson @xmath10(1020 ) @xcite .",
    "therefore the lagrangian density for the pure hadronic phase is given by @xmath11    here @xmath12 denotes the dirac spinor for baryon b with vacuum mass @xmath13 and isospin operator @xmath14 .",
    "the scalar self - interaction term @xcite is @xmath15 the lagrangian density ( @xmath16 ) responsible for hyperon - hyperon interaction is given by , @xmath17    at the interior of compact stars , the generalised @xmath2-decay processes may be written in the form @xmath18 and @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are baryons and l is a lepton .",
    "these weak processes conserve baryon number and electric charge and are in chemical equilibrium .",
    "therefore the generic equation for chemical equilibrium condition is @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are respectively the chemical potentials of neutrons , electrons and i - th baryon with @xmath26 and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are baryon and electric charge of ith baryon respectively .",
    "the above equation implies that there are two independent chemical potentials @xmath23 and @xmath24 corresponding to two conserved charges i.e. baryon number and electric charge . in neutron stars , electrons are converted to muons by @xmath29 when the electron chemical potential becomes equal to the muon mass .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath30 in a neutron star . in the pure hadronic phase ,",
    "the total charge density is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the number density of baryon b in the pure hadronic phase and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are charge densities of electrons and muons respectively .    solving the equations of motion in the mean field approximation @xcite along with effective baryon masses ( @xmath35 ) and equilibrium conditions we immediately compute the equation of state in the pure hadronic phase .",
    "the energy density ( @xmath36 ) is related to the pressure ( @xmath37 ) in this phase through the gibbs - duhem relation @xmath38 here @xmath25 and @xmath39 are chemical potential and number density for i - th species .",
    "the pure antikaon condensed phase is composed of baryons , leptons and antikaons . in this phase , the constituents of matter are in chemical equilibrium under weak interactions and maintain local charge neutrality .",
    "the baryon - baryon interaction in the pure condensed phase is described by the lagrangian density as given by eq .",
    "earlier it was shown that nucleons in the pure nuclear and antikaon condensed matter behaved differently because of their dynamical nature @xcite .",
    "it was attributed to different mean fields which nucleons experienced in the pure phases .",
    "we adopt a relativistic field theoretical approach for the description of ( anti)kaon - baryon interaction @xcite . here",
    ", baryon - baryon and ( anti)kaon - baryon interactions are treated on the same footing .",
    "we also include @xmath1 condensation in this calculation and it occurs as a second order phase transition in the pure @xmath0 condensed phase .",
    "the lagrangian density for ( anti)kaons in the minimal coupling scheme is , @xmath40 where the covariant derivative @xmath41 .",
    "the isospin doublet for kaons is denoted by @xmath42 and that for antikaons is @xmath43 .",
    "the effective mass of ( anti)kaons in this minimal coupling scheme is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the bare kaon mass .",
    "in the mean field approximation @xcite adopted here , the meson fields are replaced by their expectation values .",
    "the mean meson fields are denoted by @xmath46 , @xmath9 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the dispersion relation representing the in - medium energies of @xmath43 for @xmath50-wave ( @xmath51 ) condensation is given by @xmath52 where the isospin projection @xmath53 for the mesons @xmath0 ( @xmath54 sign ) and @xmath1 ( + sign ) are explicitly written in the expression .",
    "since the @xmath46 and @xmath55 fields generally increase with density and both the terms containing @xmath46 and @xmath55 fields in eq.(9 ) are attractive for antikaons , the in - medium energies of @xmath56 mesons decrease in nuclear medium . on the other hand , in nucleon - only matter @xmath57 (",
    "@xmath58 and @xmath59 are the proton and neutron densities ) is negative ; thus the @xmath60-meson field favors the formation of @xmath1 condensation over that of @xmath0 condensation . in hyperonic matter",
    ", the repulsive @xmath10 meson term may delay the onsets of antikaon condensation @xcite .",
    "the in - medium energies of kaons @xmath42 are given by , @xmath61 it is evident here that kaon condensation may be impossible in @xmath2-equilibrated matter because the @xmath55-meson term is repulsive for kaons and dominates over the attractive @xmath46-meson term at higher densities .",
    "however , the attractive @xmath10 meson term may decrease kaon energies in the presence of hyperons @xcite .",
    "the meson field equations in the pure condensed phase are derived from eqs .",
    "( 1)-(3 ) and ( 7 ) as @xmath62 here the scalar and number density of baryon @xmath63 in the antikaon condensed phase are respectively @xmath64 with effective baryonic mass @xmath65 , fermi momentum @xmath66 , spin @xmath67 , and isospin projection @xmath68 .",
    "note that for @xmath50-wave @xmath69 condensation , the scalar and vector densities of antikaons are same and those are given by @xcite @xmath70 the total energy density in the antikaon condensed matter has contributions from baryons , leptons and antikaons and is given by , @xmath71 where @xmath72 goes over electrons and muons and the energy density for antikaons is @xmath73 since antikaons form @xmath50-wave bose condensates , they do not directly contribute to the pressure so that the pressure is due to baryons and leptons only @xmath74 the effect of antikaons in the pressure term is through the meson fields , which change due to the presence of additional antikaon source terms in the equations of motions in eqs .",
    "( 11)-(15 ) . in the absence of those source terms for antikaons ,",
    "we retain the equations of motion for meson fields in the pure hadronic phase .    with the onset of @xmath56 condensation , other strangeness changing processes may occur such as , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , where @xmath77 and @xmath78 denote the isospin doublets for nucleons and antikaons , respectively .",
    "the requirement of chemical equilibrium yields @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are respectively the chemical potentials of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the above conditions determine the onsets of antikaon condensations .",
    "when the effective energy of @xmath0 meson ( @xmath82 ) equals to its chemical potential ( @xmath80 ) which , in turn , is equal to @xmath24 , a @xmath0 condensate is formed .",
    "similarly , @xmath1 condensation is formed when its in - medium energy satisfies the condition @xmath83 .",
    "the total charge density in the antikaon condensed phase is @xmath84    now we describe the mixed phase of hadronic matter and @xmath0 condensed matter . in earlier works ,",
    "the maxwell construction was employed for a first order phase transition to antikaon condensation @xcite .",
    "it was argued that the maxwell construction was adequate for a system with only one conserved charge @xcite .",
    "however , neutron star matter has more than one conserved charge . as evident from the generic equation of @xmath2-equilibrium ( eq .",
    "( 4 ) ) there are two independent chemical potentials namely @xmath23 and @xmath24 connected to the conservation of baryon number and electric charge , respectively . therefore",
    ", a maxwell construction in this case will result in a discontinuity in one of the chemical potentials @xcite .",
    "it was shown by glendenning @xcite that the gibbs conditions for thermodynamic equilibrium along with global conservation laws would be required to describe the mixed phase . for compact star matter",
    "the gibbs phase rules read , @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are chemical potentials of baryon b in the pure hadronic and @xmath0 condensed phase , respectively .",
    "the conditions of global charge neutrality and baryon number conservation are imposed through the relations @xmath88 @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the volume fraction of @xmath0 condensed phase in the mixed phase .",
    "the total energy density in the mixed phase is @xmath91",
    "in the effective field theoretic approach discussed here , knowledge of three distinct sets of coupling constants for nucleons , kaons and hyperons associated with the exchange of scalar @xmath46 , isoscalar - vector @xmath55 , and vector - isovector @xmath60 mesons and two additional hidden - strangeness mesons , scalar meson ( @xmath9 ) and vector meson @xmath10 are required .",
    "the nucleon - meson coupling constants generated by reproducing the nuclear matter saturation properties are taken from glendenning and moszkowski of ref .",
    "this set is referred to as gm1 and its parameters are also listed in table i.    the vector coupling constants for hyperons are determined from su(6 ) symmetry as , @xmath92 the scalar meson ( @xmath46 ) coupling to hyperons is obtained from the potential depth of a hyperon ( y ) in the saturated nuclear matter @xmath93 the analysis of energy levels in @xmath3-hypernuclei suggests a well depth of @xmath3 in symmetric nuclear matter @xmath94 mev @xcite . on the other hand , recent analysis of a few @xmath95-hypernuclei events in emulsion experiments predicts a @xmath95 well depth of @xmath96 mev @xcite in normal nuclear matter . however , the situation for the @xmath97 potential depth in normal nuclear matter is very unclear .",
    "the only known bound @xmath97-hypernucleus is @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "the most updated analysis of @xmath99 atomic data indicates a strong isoscalar repulsion in @xmath97-nuclear matter interaction @xcite .",
    "therefore , we use a repulsive @xmath97 well depth of @xmath100 mev @xcite in this calculation .",
    "the @xmath9-y coupling constants are obtained by fitting them to a well depth , @xmath101 , for a hyperon ( y ) in a hyperon ( @xmath102 ) matter at nuclear saturation density @xcite .",
    "it is given as @xmath103 nucleons do not couple to the strange mesons i.e. @xmath104 .",
    "now we determine kaon - meson coupling constants . according to the quark model and isospin counting rule ,",
    "the vector coupling constants are given by @xmath105 the scalar coupling constant is obtained from the real part of @xmath0 optical potential depth at normal nuclear matter density @xmath106    the strange meson fields also couple with ( anti)kaons . following ref.[@xcite ] , the @xmath9-k coupling constant is determined from the decay of @xmath8(925 ) as @xmath107 , whereas the vector @xmath10 meson coupling with ( anti)kaons is obtained from su(3 ) relation as @xmath108 .",
    "it was observed in previous calculations that antikaons experienced an attractive potential and kaons had a repulsive interaction in nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "the analysis of @xmath0 atomic data in the hybrid model @xcite yielded the real part of the antikaon optical potential as large as @xmath109mev at normal nuclear matter density but it was repulsive at low density in accordance with the low density theorem .",
    "also , the antikaon potential depth in the coupled channel calculation @xcite was found to be @xmath110 mev whereas the chirally motivated coupled channel approach @xcite gave rise to a potential depth of @xmath111 mev .",
    "the different treatments of @xmath3(1405 ) resonance which is considered to be an unstable @xmath112 bound state just below @xmath113 threshold , may be responsible for the wide range of antikaon optical potential depth values in various calculations . in table",
    "ii , we list kaon-@xmath46 meson coupling constant @xmath114 , for a set of antikaon optical potential depths starting from -100 mev to -180 mev .",
    "the conversion of nucleons to hyperons is energetically favorable in @xmath2- equilibrated and charge neutral dense matter .",
    "hyperons first appear in dense matter around ( 2 - 3)@xmath115 .",
    "negatively charged hyperons quench the growth of electron chemical potential .",
    "also the equation of state is softened in the presence of hyperons .",
    "therefore , it was shown in various calculations neglecting hyperon - hyperon interaction that the formation of @xmath56 condensate was postponed to higher densities @xcite .",
    "as the matter is hyperon - rich in the high density regime , hyperon - hyperon interaction becomes important .",
    "this interaction may be accounted by including two additional mesons @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "these strange mesons also couple with ( anti)kaons .",
    "it follows from strangeness numbers of hyperons and @xmath56 mesons that the @xmath10 field is repulsive for hyperons as well as for antikaons .",
    "the additional attraction due to @xmath9 field makes the eos softer . on the other hand ,",
    "the repulsive contribution of @xmath10 field becomes dominant at higher densities and a stiffer eos is obtained . for calculations with gm1 set and various values of @xmath116 mev , we find that the threshold of @xmath0 condensation in @xmath2-equilibrated hyperonic matter is shifted to very high density ( 7.5@xmath115 ) where effective nucleon mass becomes small @xcite . this is attributed to the early appearance of @xmath117 hyperons which diminish the electron chemical potential and the presence of repulsive @xmath10 field in the expression of energy for @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons ( eq.(9 ) ) .",
    "now we perform our calculation using gm1 set and antikaon optical potential depth of @xmath118 mev . in figure 1",
    "we exhibit the particle fraction of @xmath2-equilibrated matter containing baryons , electrons , muons and @xmath0 mesons . in the pure hadronic phase where local charge neutrality condition is imposed",
    ", abundances of nucleons , electrons and muons increase with density . here , charge neutrality is maintained among protons , electrons and muons . with the onset of @xmath0 condensation ,",
    "the mixed phase begins at 2.23@xmath115 .",
    "this mixed phase is determined by the gibbs phase rules for pure hadronic and antikaon condensed phase in thermodynamic equilibrium and by global baryon number and electric charge conservation laws .",
    "we find that @xmath3 hyperon is the first strange baryon to appear in the mixed phase at 2.51@xmath115 .",
    "the total baryon density in the mixed phase is the sum of two contributions from the hadronic and antikaon condensed phase weighted with appropriate volume fractions .",
    "as soon as @xmath0 condensate is formed , it rapidly grows with density and replaces electrons and muons .",
    "being bosons , @xmath0 mesons in the lowest energy state are energetically more favorable to maintain charge neutrality than any other negatively charged particles .",
    "consequently , the proton density becomes equal to the density of @xmath0 condensate .",
    "also , the density of @xmath3 hyperon increases with density in the mixed phase . on the other hand ,",
    "the neutron density decreases in the mixed phase .",
    "the reason behind it may be the creation of more protons in the presence of @xmath0 condensate and also the growth of @xmath3 hyperons at the expense of neutrons .",
    "the mixed phase terminates at 4.0@xmath115 .",
    "heavier hyperons appear in the pure condensed phase .",
    "as @xmath117 hyperons start populating this phase at 6.77@xmath115 , the density of @xmath0 condensate falls .",
    "however , the rising behavior of @xmath0 condensate is regained with the onset of @xmath119 hyperons at 7.86@xmath115 .",
    "it is to be noted that @xmath99 hyperons do not appear in this case .",
    "besides @xmath0 condensation , we now investigate the role of @xmath1 condensation in @xmath2-equilibrated and charge neutral matter consisting of nucleons , hyperons , electrons and muons .",
    "the abundances of various species are shown in figure 2 .",
    "the composition of the pure hadronic and mixed phase in this case is similar to that of fig .",
    "once the mixed phase is over , @xmath1 condensation occurs at @xmath1204.1@xmath121 .",
    "we consider @xmath1 condensation as a second order phase transition .",
    "the antikaon condensed phase including @xmath1 condensate along with @xmath0 condensate is different from that of fig .",
    "1 . with the appearance of @xmath1 condensate , neutron and proton",
    "abundances become equal and a symmetric matter of nucleons is formed in this phase .",
    "the density of @xmath1 condensate increases with baryon density uninterruptedly and even becomes larger than the density of @xmath0 condensate . at higher densities , more hyperons",
    "start populating the system .",
    "as soon as negatively charged hyperons - @xmath117 and @xmath99 appear , the density of @xmath0 condensate is observed to fall drastically .",
    "this is quite expected because it is energetically favorable for particles carrying conserved baryon numbers to achieve charge neutrality in the system .",
    "leptons or mesons are no longer required for this sole purpose . moreover ,",
    "lepton number or meson number is not conserved in the star .",
    "the system is dominated by @xmath1 condensate in the high density regime .",
    "one important aspect of this calculation is the dynamic behavior of baryons in pure hadronic and antikaon condensed phase .",
    "earlier , this dynamical behavior of nucleons was noted by glendenning and schaffner @xcite . besides nucleons",
    ", we find similar properties of @xmath3 hyperons which appear in the mixed phase .",
    "it is evident from eq . (",
    "11 ) and eq .",
    "( 12 ) that baryons have different effective masses in the hadronic and condensed phase due to different @xmath46 and @xmath9 fields . in the pure hadronic phase ,",
    "the effective mass of a baryon decreases with density . with the onset of the mixed phase , a second solution for the effective baryon mass emerges",
    "this is the effective baryon mass in the condensed phase .",
    "the value of the effective baryon mass in the pure hadronic phase is always higher than that of the antikaon condensed phase . in the condensed phase",
    ", the effective mass of a baryon also decreases with density .",
    "equation of state , pressure(p ) versus energy density ( @xmath122 ) , for @xmath2-equilibrated and charge neutral matter with different compositions are displayed in figure 3 .",
    "here the long - dashed curve stands for hyperonic matter without any antikaon condensate .",
    "the dotted curve represents hyperonic matter including @xmath0 condensate whereas the solid curve corresponds to hyperonic matter with both @xmath0 and @xmath1 condensate .",
    "the eos denoted by the dashed - dot curve is same as given by the solid except no @xmath95 hyperon is present in the system in this case .",
    "two kinks in the solid curve marks the beginning and end of the mixed phase where pure hadronic and @xmath0 condensed phase are in thermodynamic equilibrium as dictated by the gibbs conditions and global conservation laws . immediately after the termination of the mixed phase at 4.0@xmath115 ,",
    "@xmath1 condensation sets in at @xmath120 4.1@xmath115 .",
    "we have treated here @xmath1 condensation as a second order phase transition .",
    "also we find that the pressure increases continuously with energy ( solid curve ) after the formation of @xmath1 condensation .",
    "earlier it was noted that the antikaon condensation could be a second order phase transition depending on the strength of antikaon optical potential depth and parameter sets of different models @xcite . though the dotted curve has overlap with the solid curve up to the mixed phase , it becomes stiffer in the high density regime . on the other hand ,",
    "the dashed - dot curve becomes stiffer compared to the solid curve because there is lesser number of degrees of freedom with the absence of @xmath95 hyperons in the former case . with the appearance of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 condensation in hyperonic matter , the overall eos ( solid curve )",
    "is softened due to the strong attraction imparted by antikaon condensation .",
    "we have used the results of baym , pethick and sutherland @xcite to describe the crust of a compact star composed of leptons and nuclei for the low density ( @xmath123 ) eos . in the mid density regime ( @xmath124 )",
    "the results of negele and vautherin @xcite are taken into account . above this density",
    ", an eos calculated in the relativistic model has been adopted .",
    "now we present the results of static structures of spherically symmetric compact stars calculated using tov equations .",
    "the static compact star sequences representing the stellar masses @xmath125 and the corresponding central energy densities @xmath126 are shown in figure 4 .",
    "we denote the sequence of neutron stars with @xmath0 condensation in hyperonic matter by the dotted curve . here",
    ", the maximum neutron star mass is 1.649@xmath127 occurring at central density 7.7@xmath115 .",

    "the solid curve represents compact stars with both @xmath0 and @xmath1 condensation in hyperonic matter .",
    "when @xmath1 condensation along with @xmath0 condensation is taken into account , the limiting mass of the neutron star branch is attained at much earlier central density 4.49@xmath115 .",
    "in fact , the limiting mass star appears very close to the upper boundary of the mixed phase and has a smaller value 1.571@xmath127 than the situation with only @xmath0 condensation .",
    "this reduction in the maximum mass of the star may be attributed to the softening of the eos in the presence of @xmath0 and @xmath56 condensate .",
    "after the stable neutron star branch , there is an unstable region followed by a sequence of compact stars in fig .",
    "this branch of super dense stars beyond the neutron star branch is called a third family of compact stars @xcite .",
    "there are two third family branches in fig .",
    "4 . the lower curve depicts the third family of compact stars with both antikaon condensates in hyperonic matter ( case i ) whereas the upper curve represents the third family of compact stars including both condensates in hyperonic matter except @xmath95 hyperons ( case ii ) .",
    "the maximum masses of compact stars in the third family branches denoted by the lower curve and upper curve are 1.552@xmath127 and 1.561@xmath127 corresponding to the central densities 8.09@xmath115 and @xmath129 respectively .",
    "it is the behavior of the eos including both @xmath0 and @xmath1 condensate in the mid and high density regime that results in a third family of super dense star .",
    "the possibility of a third family of compact stars was already discussed in the context of quark - hadron phase transition @xcite and hadronic matter to hyperonic matter phase transition @xcite .",
    "we have found a new sequence of compact stars called the third family of compact stars beyond the neutron star branch as is evident in fig .",
    "so far , we have discussed the hydrostatic stability of the stellar sequence in the third family using tov equations @xcite . in fig .",
    "4 , we note that the neutron star branch or the third family branch has positive slope i.e. dm / d@xmath130 . though the positive slope of a steller sequence is a necessary condition for stability , dynamical stability requires the analysis of the fundamental mode of radial vibration @xcite . in the third family branches in fig .",
    "4 , we find that each configuration is stable because the squared frequency of the fundamental mode associated with it is positive .",
    "similar results were obtained in the study of compact stars beyond the neutron star branch using quark - hadron phase transition by various groups @xcite .",
    "we exhibit the mass - radius relationship for different eos in figure 5 .",
    "the maximum mass star composed of hyperons and no condensate ( not shown here ) has a radius of 12.8 km whereas it is 10.9 km for the maximum mass neutron star including hyperons and @xmath0 condensate ( dotted curve ) .",
    "two cases where we obtain stable solutions beyond the neutron star branch are shown in the inset .",
    "the solid curve denotes the sequences of compact stars having hyperons and @xmath0 and @xmath1 condensate . in the neutron star branch ,",
    "the maximum mass star has a radius of 12.8 km . for the third family branches",
    ", the lower curve corresponds to case i and the upper curve denotes case ii .",
    "the radius of the maximum mass super dense star on the lower curve is 10.7 km whereas that of case ii is 10.2 km . in this calculation",
    ", we find that the existence of non - identical stars of same mass may be possible because of partial overlapping of the neutron star and the third family branch .",
    "these pairs are known as `` neutron star twins '' @xcite . also , we observe that the high density twin is a very compact object with a different composition and smaller radius than its low density counter part .",
    "it is to be noted that the radius of the maximum mass star with @xmath0 condensate in hyperonic matter is comparable to that of the third family considered here .",
    "this implies that only one star with small radius can not ensure the existence of a third family of compact stars .",
    "schertler et al .",
    "@xcite argued that two stars - one in the neutron star branch and the other in the third family branch with similar masses but with a radius difference of a few kilometer might reveal the existence of a third family of compact stars . in this case , the mass difference ( @xmath131 m ) of two stars is to be much less than the radius difference ( @xmath131r ) i.e. @xmath132 . in our calculation , we note that @xmath131r is almost two orders of magnitude larger than @xmath131 m .",
    "we also investigate the high density behaviour of the equation of state in tm1 model @xcite .",
    "besides scalar self interaction terms , tm1 model includes non - linear @xmath55 meson term @xcite .",
    "the parameters of tm1 model are listed in table i and table ii . in this model , antikaon condensations",
    "are found to be second order phase transitions for all values of antikaon optical potential depth @xcite .",
    "the eos behaves smoothly even in the high density regime .",
    "there is no existence of a third family of compact stars in tm1 model because of this smooth eos .",
    "we have investigated @xmath0 and @xmath1-meson condensation in @xmath2-equilibrated hyperonic matter within a relativistic mean field model . in this model ,",
    "baryon - baryon and ( anti)kaon - baryon interactions are mediated by the exchange of @xmath46 , @xmath55 and @xmath60 meson .",
    "also , hyperon - hyperon interaction is accounted by considering two additional strange mesons @xmath133 and @xmath10 . in this calculation",
    ", we have adopted gm1 parameter set .",
    "the coupling constants of ( anti)kaon - meson are determined from a quark model and empirically known values of antikaon optical potential depth at normal nuclear matter density .",
    "similarly , the hyperon - meson coupling constants are obtained from hypernuclear data and su(6 ) symmetry relations .",
    "however , the coupling constant of hyperons to @xmath134 meson is obtained by reproducing the hyperon depth in a bath of the hyperons at normal nuclear matter density .",
    "the condensation of @xmath0 meson in hyperonic matter is described as a first order phase transition in this calculation .",
    "the @xmath2-equilibrated matter is composed of three phases - pure hadronic phase , pure @xmath0 condensed phase and the mixed phase of two pure phases . along with the gibbs phase rules , global conservation laws are employed in the mixed phase .    the appearance of antikaon condensation is quite sensitive to the eos and also depends on the value of antikaon optical potential depth . in the presence of hyperons ,",
    "an eos becomes softer thus delaying the onset of antikaon condensation .",
    "for antikaon optical potential depth @xmath135 mev , the early appearance of negatively charged hyperons in particular @xmath136 hyperons , reduces the electron chemical potential . and",
    "the antikaon condensation does not occur even at 7.5@xmath115 . in our calculation with @xmath118 mev , the first order phase transition to @xmath0 condensation begins at 4.0@xmath115 .",
    "the pure hadronic phase does not contain any hyperon whereas only @xmath3 hyperons appear in the mixed phase .",
    "as soon as @xmath0 condensation sets in , it is energetically favourable for @xmath0 mesons in the zero momentum state to maintain charge neutrality in the system . consequently , the formation of negatively charged hyperons are delayed to higher density . immediately after the end of the mixed phase ,",
    "@xmath1 condensation occurs in the pure @xmath0 condensed phase . here",
    ", we have treated @xmath1 condensation as a second order phase transition . with the formation of @xmath1 condensation ,",
    "abundances of neutron and protons become equal .",
    "negatively charged hyperons - @xmath136 and @xmath99 start populating the system around @xmath137 . and the density of @xmath0 condensate dwindles because hyperons having conserved baryon number are energetically more favourable for charge neutrality .",
    "consequently , @xmath1 condensate dominates the high density regime .",
    "the equation of state becomes softer in the presence of antikaon condensate compared with the situation without any condensate . among all eos considered here ,",
    "the softest eos is the one that includes both @xmath0 and @xmath1 condensate .",
    "this softening leads to the reduction in maximum masses of compact stars .",
    "the behaviour of the eos with both antikaon condensates at very high density @xmath138 and its connection to the possible existence of stable super dense stars beyond the neutron star branch have been investigated in this work . with the eos corresponding to hyperonic",
    "matter with @xmath0 and @xmath1 condensate , we find , after the termination of the neutron star branch , an unstable region followed by a stable sequence of compact stars called the third family of compact stars .",
    "it is noted that neutron star twins could exist because of partially overlapping mass regions of the neutron star branch and the third family branch .",
    "the high density twin in the third family branch has a different composition and smaller radius than its low density counter part .",
    "the observation of two compact stars with almost similar masses but different radii may shed light on the existence of a third family of super dense stars .",
