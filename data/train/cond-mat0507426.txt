    "hyperthermal deposition ( htd ) techniques , such as ion - beam assisted deposition ( ibad ) and low - energy ion deposition ( leid ) @xcite have recently been shown to have great potential in controlling and improving the properties of thin films as grown by molecular beam epitaxy . in htd",
    "the island density is larger , the average island size is smaller @xcite , and island size distributions are considerably broader @xcite than in ordinary thermal deposition .",
    "possible atomistic processes responsible for these effects include ion enhanced mobilities , cluster dissociation @xcite , and defect creation during deposition @xcite .",
    "a particularly striking observation made in the leid experiments is that with different deposition energies an anomalously high density of small islands is observed , with the scaled distribution function behaving as @xmath0 for @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we have recently shown using the rate equation ( re ) approach @xcite that this anomalously high density of small islands is due to a unique balance between island  island aggregation and enhanced adatom detachment .",
    "these studies were aimed at describing the generic features of htd , and thus relatively idealized approximations for the terms in the rate equations were used to obtain analytical estimates for the relevant growth exponents and the scaling function .",
    "one of the most important questions that still remains open is the role of _ island diffusion _ , since for mobile islands the aggregation rates in the re approach depend explicitly on the diffusion coefficients @xmath2 of islands of different sizes @xmath3 .",
    "island diffusion on surfaces has been studied both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "while in the large island limit the size dependence of the island diffusion coefficients can be classified based on simple basic processes @xcite , for smaller islands @xmath2 depends on the geometric and energetic details of the underlying surface , and can be a complicated , non - monotonic function of @xmath3 @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "our aim is to explore in detail the influence of realistic island diffusion coefficients to submonolayer growth with htd . to this end",
    ", we employ the re model of ref .",
    "@xcite and replace the usually assumed idealized power law forms of @xmath2 with realistic , temperature and size  dependent diffusion coefficients @xmath4 for cu on cu(100 ) and cu(111 ) surfaces .",
    "these two systems highlight the large differences which occur for surfaces with different geometry and energetics .",
    "we demonstrate that while the scaling function of the size distribution is largely unaffected by the details of the diffusion coefficients , the quantitative values of the growth exponents are sensitive to island diffusion .",
    "these predictions can be easily tested by htd experiments on different cu surfaces .",
    "in htd the reversibility of growth is manifested through enhanced adatom detachment from islands @xcite .",
    "detachment and island mobility allow us to neglect spatial correlations between islands @xcite , which justifies the rate equation description of the problem .",
    "thus , growth is driven by the interplay between aggregation and detachment , and can be schematically expressed to be composed of reversible events @xmath5 ; @xmath6 between islands of sizes @xmath7 and @xmath8 with the rates of aggregation and detachment specified by reaction rates @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding res for the areal density @xmath11 of islands of size @xmath12 read as @xcite @xmath13   \\\\ - \\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty } [ k(s , j)n_{s}n_{j } - f(s , j)n_{s+j } ]   + \\phi \\delta_{1s } , \\label{eq : ns }   \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the deposition flux of adatoms in monolayers per second ( ml / s ) .",
    "the aggregation rate @xmath9 for islands of sizes @xmath7 and @xmath8 with diffusivities @xmath15 and @xmath16 is given by the smoluchowski formula @xmath17 , which is also consistent with the point island approximation used here  @xcite .",
    "previously @xcite we used a power - law form for the diffusion coefficients @xmath18 with @xmath19 appropriate for island diffusion on metal surfaces . in order to study the effects of details of the aggregation rates in observable quantities we replace the idealized power - law form by realistic size and temperature dependent diffusion coefficients , as discussed below in more detail .",
    "the detachment rate of adatoms from islands of size @xmath20 depends on the island size , but only detachment of single adatoms is allowed . thus the detachment rate is given by @xmath21 , where the exponent @xmath22 is in principle a parameter , but is chosen to be @xmath23 in the present study . in leid",
    "this form for the detachment rate is physically a well justified choice , because in the regime of bombarding energies from 10 ev to 100 ev adatom detachment dominates and island breakup into larger pieces is not expected to occur @xcite .",
    "moreover , since every deposition event at the vicinity of an island boundary can be assumed to detach adatoms at least with a probability proportional to the island perimeter ( i.e.  @xmath24 ) , @xmath23 is a reasonable lower limit .",
    "this has been also confirmed by recent molecular dynamics simulations on ion bombardment enhanced detachment in island size region up to 25 atoms where values of @xmath25 were found @xcite .",
    "we solve the rate equations using the particle coalescence method ( pcm ) @xcite .",
    "pcm employs a point - island approximation , which is valid at low coverages or large island separations . in pcm aggregation and",
    "detachment events occur with probabilities specified by the corresponding reaction kernels , and the deposition with the rate proportional to the given adatom flux .",
    "an event is then randomly chosen with a probability weighted by the corresponding rate . since res describe the system in the mean - field limit , there is no information on spatial correlations in the system .",
    "therefore , in the simulations it is sufficient to construct a list of islands , which does not correspond to a physical lattice . to conduct an aggregation event , for example , two islands are randomly chosen from the list , and an attempt to aggregate them is made .",
    "the complete mixing of the islands required by the mean - field approximation @xcite is thus implemented much faster than including island jumps into empty lattice sites @xcite .",
    "in reality the diffusion coefficients of islands depend on island size non - trivially , and not simply as power laws .",
    "they can even oscillate as a function of the island size @xcite .",
    "these oscillations can be in part understood by the surface geometry : certain close packed island configurations can be more stable than others on certain surfaces @xcite .",
    "here we concentrate on two qualitatively and quantitatively different types of diffusion coefficients , namely those of cu adatom islands on cu(100 ) and cu(111 ) surfaces .",
    "first , the diffusion coefficients @xmath4 from kinetic monte carlo ( kmc ) simulations , which were based on effective medium theory energetics for the cu(100 ) surface , are shown in fig .  [ fig : cu100 ] at three different temperatures @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 k @xcite . at the lowest temperatures",
    "the oscillations as a function of @xmath3 are clearly seen . as temperature increases ,",
    "the oscillations dampen , and at the highest temperature the diffusion coefficient is rather well described by @xmath29 , if island diffusion is limited by atomic motion along the perimeter of an island  @xcite . for cu(100 ) , there is a strong dependence of @xmath2 on temparature here because the single adatom diffusion barrier is about @xmath30 ev .",
    "in contrast to the behavior on cu(100 ) , island diffusion on cu(111 ) follows a completely different trend .",
    "the most spectacular difference is the almost complete absence of oscillations in the diffusion coefficient with size for the smaller islands ( @xmath31 atoms ) @xcite .",
    "this is seen to occur when small islands diffuse via occupancy of both hcp and fcc sites .",
    "also , there is relatively little temperature dependence on @xmath4 for small sizes , since the surface is relatively smooth with an adatom activation energy of @xmath32 ev , and almost the same for dimers and trimers . in the case of cu(111 ) , the calculations were carried out using a kmc procedure in which the system is allowed to evolve according to diffusion processes of its choice .",
    "this is facilitated through the automatic generation of a database of possible diffusion processes and their activation energy barriers calculated using embedded atom method potentials .",
    "the storage and retrieval of information from the database is done via a pattern recognition scheme @xcite . from simulations performed at @xmath26",
    "k , @xmath27 k , and @xmath28 k , the effective diffusion barriers are found to increase almost monotonically with size , while the diffusion coefficient takes the form shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cu111 ] . calculations performed for larger sized islands ( @xmath33 ) show a power law scaling of @xmath34 with island size and with an exponent of about @xmath35 which is mildly temperature dependent @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the theoretical value of @xmath36 for large island motion dominated by atom diffusion along island perimeter @xcite .",
    "in our previous study @xcite the island size distributions were of the scaling form and the mean island size had a power - law form . therefore , even if the detachment rate was not a homogeneous function of the island size , we could extract well - defined effective scaling exponents for the mean island size and the size distribution function . in the present case",
    ", we expect that scaling is invalidated due to realistic diffusion coefficients which have a naturally inhomogeneous form .",
    "there is no guarantee of either the existence of usual scaling type of solutions or uniquely defined scaling exponents for the mean island size and island density .",
    "thus , e.g.  the dynamic exponent for the mean island size can be expected to be model - dependent , i.e.  we could obtain different values for different sets of diffusion coefficients .",
    "this has been shown to be the case in more general reversible growth models @xcite and growth with mobile islands @xcite , where the scaling exponents explicitly depend on the details of the model .",
    "we define the mean island size @xmath37 , where the @xmath38 moment of the distribution is defined as @xmath39 .",
    "if the scaling of the island size distribution holds , we expect that @xmath40 , where @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the surface coverage , and @xmath43 is a scaling function independent of coverage . in our previous work @xcite",
    "we found that the scaling function is always singular , i.e.  @xmath0 for @xmath1 . in order to compare the scaling function with our previous results",
    ", we will use in the following the modified scaling function of the form @xmath44 .",
    "the pcm simulations were carried out using island diffusion coefficients discussed above for cu(100 ) and cu(111 ) , and with the detachment rate characterized by the exponent @xmath45 .",
    "we define @xmath46 and @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the adatom diffusion coefficient .",
    "parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 denote the importance of detachment relative to diffusion , and of diffusion relative to deposition flux , respectively . in the simulations the corresponding values were in the ranges @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the simulations show that for large detachment rates , @xmath53 and @xmath54 indeed follow a power - law type of behavior , but as @xmath55 decreases , @xmath56 becomes coverage - dependent , and saturates only for @xmath57 as we have previously shown @xcite .",
    "thus , only for large @xmath55 can well - defined scaling exponents be extracted and regular island growth observed , and in this regime the island size distributions are of scaling form .",
    "the measured values of the dynamic growth exponent @xmath56 at different temperatures and large @xmath55 both for cu(100 ) and cu(111 ) are shown in table  [ tab : beta ] .",
    "the exponent @xmath56 seems to be temperature dependent for cu(100 ) but not for cu(111 ) . for cu(100 )",
    "this can be explained by examining the corresponding curves for the diffusion coefficients in fig .",
    "[ fig : cu100 ] . for small sizes ( which is the case for large @xmath55 )",
    "the average slope of the diffusion coefficient curves depends strongly on temperature . if one fits a power law into the initial part of the data ( for @xmath58 ) , the effective exponents are @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 at @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 k , respectively . for the power - law type aggregation kernels we found @xcite that the dynamic exponent behaves as @xmath62 , when @xmath63 .",
    "using the effective exponents above this prediction gives @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 , showing a similar trend as the measured values .",
    "if the measured values are used , somewhat smaller @xmath67 are obtained than from the fits to the diffusion coefficient data . if the fitting is done only through maxima of the diffusion coefficient curves , a better agreement is obtained .",
    "it is also interesting to note that @xmath53 does not depend on @xmath68 in this regime , but only on @xmath55 .",
    "this suggests that it could be possible to tune the regime for the effective diffusion exponent on cu(100 ) by changing @xmath55 .",
    "however , this effect is probably too small to be seen , since e.g.  on cu(100 ) at @xmath26 k we get @xmath69 atoms for @xmath70 , and @xmath71 atoms for @xmath72 , while the differences in @xmath56 between these two cases are within the errors . for cu(111 ) there is no clear power - law for small sizes where the simulation data for diffusion coefficients exist .",
    "instead , small island sizes seem to be rather mobile relative to adatoms in all temperatures .",
    ".dynamic scaling exponents @xmath56 as defined in the text at different temperatures obtained from the pcm simulations , using the diffusion coefficients for cu(100 ) and cu(111 ) in figs .",
    "[ fig : cu100 ] and [ fig : cu111 ] .",
    "the asterisk for cu(111 ) at @xmath73 k indicates that the exponent is not yet constant in time .",
    "the errors in other cases are about @xmath74 . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we expect to observe scaling of island size distributions on the basis of the fact that well - defined scaling exponents exist for large detachment rates . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ns ] we show scaled island size distributions for large values of detachment rates using the diffusion coefficients for cu(100 ) and cu(111 ) shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : cu100 ] and [ fig : cu111 ] , and setting @xmath23 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 . on cu(100 )",
    "the data for different temperatures collapse to a single curve , and for @xmath77 the scaled distribution is almost flat .",
    "deviations between different temperatures occur at small sizes , which reflects the differences in the diffusion coefficients .",
    "the inset shows the scaled distribution on cu(111 ) . in this case",
    "scaling of the distribution is not as good , and differences at small sizes are larger than on cu(100 ) .",
    "this reflects the fact that on cu(111 ) the diffusion coefficients for small island sizes do not follow any power - law type behavior but are almost constant in @xmath3 , thus invalidating the scaling behavior as in a more simplified model for @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "it is , however , expected that deviations could be seen in the large size tail of the distribution . since the diffusion coefficients decrease several orders in magnitude , e.g.  from single atoms to islands of size @xmath79 , all aggregation events leading to large sizes are basically between a small island and a large one .",
    "to summarize , we have studied a rate equation model with aggregation and enhanced adatom detachment corresponding to hyperthermal deposition conditions using realistic size and temperature dependent diffusion coefficients for cu(100 ) and cu(111 ) .",
    "we have shown that qualitatively the generic features of growth , e.g.  the form of the scaling function of the size distribution , are not influenced by diffusion , but quantitative predictions depend on the microscopic parameters .",
    "for example , the mean island size follows a power - law form in all cases with the exponent dependent on temperature and surface geometry .",
    "scaling of the size distribution and the mean island size can be observed , however , only for large values of adatom detachment rates .",
    "these findings suggest that differences between various surface geometries can be observed only in the dynamic quantities such as the scaling exponent of the mean island size , but not e.g.  in the scaled island size distribution which is time - independent .",
    "these predictions can be easily tested with htd on cu surfaces .    _",
