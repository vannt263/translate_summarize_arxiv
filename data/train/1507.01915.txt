    "there is currently a great interest in strictly two - dimensional ( 2d ) crystalline materials , like graphene,@xcite silicene ,  @xcite germanene ,  @xcite and others .",
    "a common feature of these materials is a 2d hexagonal lattice of atoms  carbon , silicon , and germanium , respectively .",
    "however , both silicene and germanene have buckled atomic structure , where the two triangular sublattices are slightly displaced along the normal to the atomic plane , whereas all carbon atoms in graphene are localized in a common plane .",
    "this buckling of atomic structure leads to new properties of silicene and germanene ,  @xcite which make them different from graphene .",
    "electronic states around the charge neutrality points of these materials are usually described by the relativistic dirac model.@xcite this model , however , neglects the electron - electron interaction .",
    "moreover , some deviations of the exact electronic structure from the conical dispersion relation characteristic of the dirac model appear for states distant from the dirac points . in other words ,",
    "the exact electronic structure is more complex , and either tight binding models or _ ab - inito _ techniques are usually employed to calculate the corresponding band structure , especially in the case of nanoribbons.@xcite it is already well known that the coulomb interaction between electrons leads to edge magnetism in nanoribbons with zigzag edges.@xcite in the ground state of the system , magnetic moments localized at one edge are opposite to those at the other edge.@xcite in some situations , however , one can stabilize a quasi - stable ferromagnetic state , where all edge moments are oriented in parallel.@xcite spin - orbit interaction gives rise to a magnetic anisotropy , and when this coupling is sufficiently strong , an in - plane orientation of the edge moments is energetically more favorable.@xcite thus , the interplay of spin - orbit and coulomb interactions is of fundamental importance for the edge magnetism .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction also leads to topologically protected edge states in the spin - orbit gap,@xcite and these states are responsible for topological - insulator properties of these materials.@xcite however , coulomb interaction has a significant impact on these properties . * ? ? ?",
    "* accordingly , the interplay of spin - orbit and coulomb interactions is important not only for the edge magnetism , but also for the topological state of these materials .",
    "therefore , in this paper we consider this issue in the case of zigzag nanoribbons of two - dimensional buckled hexagonal crystals , and especially the role of coulomb interaction and spin - orbit coupling .",
    "we focus on the thermoelectric and spin thermoelectric effects of these materials in the ballistic transport regime , and on their dependence on the coulomb and spin - orbit interactions .",
    "first , we calculate energy of various magnetic configurations in zigzag nanoribbons , and find that the antiparallel configuration with in - plane magnetic moments is the ground state structure for large enough spin - orbit coupling . for small spin - orbit coupling , the in - plane and perpendicular - to - plane configurations are degenerate .",
    "then , we calculate the electronic states , with a special emphasis on the edge states responsible for the topological properties . having determined the magnetic state and also the electronic edge states , we calculate thermoelectric properties with the main focus on the role of topological edge states and transition from the topological to conventional insulator state .",
    "generally , the thermoelectric and especially the spin thermoelectric effects in systems of reduced dimensionality are currently of great interest,@xcite mainly due to a hope to find an efficient way to convert dissipated heat into electrical energy .",
    "in fact , thermoelectric properties of nanoribbons have been studied theoretically in a couple of papers.@xcite however , the role of coulomb interaction and topological edge states in the gap , has not been studied thoroughly enough yet . in a recent paper@xcite",
    "we have analyzed the influence of topological states on the thermoelectric properties , with the main focus on the role of a staggered exchange field  @xcite and of an electric field perpendicular to the atomic plane .",
    "here we consider in more details the role of coulomb interaction , which has a significant impact on the topological properties.@xcite    in section 2 we present the hamiltonian used to describe the 2d materials under consideration , and also introduce briefly the method used to calculate transmission function and then all the thermoelectric and transport coefficients . in section 3 we present numerical results on the edge magnetism , topologically protected states , and thermoelectric properties of the corresponding zigzag nanoribbons .",
    "summary and final conclusions are in section 4 .",
    "the zigzag nanoribbons of hexagonal 2d crystals , like silicene or germanene , which are analyzed in this paper consist of @xmath0 zigzag atomic chains .",
    "the system can be described by hamiltonian of the following general form : @xmath1 where the first term , @xmath2 , is the tight - binding hamiltonian , the term @xmath3 represents the spin - orbit coupling , while the last term , @xmath4 , stands for the electron - electron coulomb interaction .",
    "the tight - binding hamiltonian is assumed in the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator for an electron with spin @xmath8 at the lattice point @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the spin quantization axis is taken along the @xmath11-axis , which is normal to the atomic plane .",
    "the tight - binding term is restricted here to electron hopping between nearest - neighbor sites , with the corresponding hopping parameter @xmath12 .",
    "for instance , @xmath13 in silicene.@xcite    the intrinsic spin - orbit interaction in eq .",

    "the electron - electron interaction will be taken into account in the hubbard form within the mean - field approximation ( mfa ) .",
    "the form of the mfa hubbard hamiltonian depends on whether the spin quantization axis is parallel to the local magnetization orientation or not .",

    "we have shown that the coulomb interaction , taken in the form of hubbard term in the mean field approximation , leads to formation of the edge magnetic moments , which for a sufficiently strong spin - orbit coupling are oriented in the nanoribbon plane in the ground state , and the moments at one edge are opposite to those at the other edge ( afm@xmath87 phase )  in agreement with lado et al.@xcite for small spin - orbit coupling , this configuration is almost degenerate with the state , in which magnetic moments are oriented perpendicularly to the nanoribbon plane ( afm@xmath86 phase ) .",

    "such states can be stabilized externally , e.g. by a magnetic field and/or due to proximity to a ferromagnetic contact .",
    "as the afm@xmath87 phase remains in the topological insulator state when the pin - orbit coupling increases , the afm@xmath86 phase undergoes then a transition from the topological to conventional insulator , i.e. an energy gap opens in the corresponding edge states .",

    "this behavior qualitatively resembles that of the antiferromagnetic phases , but now the gap in the fm@xmath87 state , which opens with increasing @xmath15 , is spin dependent . as a result",
