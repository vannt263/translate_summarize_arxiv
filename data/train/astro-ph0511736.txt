    "it is well known that quantum fluctuations of the inflaton field in the simplest inflationary models produce gaussian adiabatic perturbations of metric with nearly scale independent spectrum @xcite .",
    "this prediction is in a very good agreement with the present observational data @xcite .",
    "however , since the precision of the observational data improves every year , one may try to discriminate between various inflationary models by considering subtle deviations from the standard paradigm .",
    "one way to distinguish between various models is by studying a small degree of nongaussianity of perturbations , and a possible small contribution of the isocurvature perturbations .",
    "it is impossible to produce isocurvature perturbations in the models describing a single scalar field , the inflaton , and the degree of nongaussianity of the inflaton perturbations typically is extremely small .",
    "however , it is relatively easy to produce isocurvature and/or nongaussian adiabatic perturbations in the models containing several light scalar fields . the first model of that type",
    "was proposed in @xcite .",
    "it was based on investigation of axions , which were massless during inflation . at that stage",
    ", the axion perturbations practically did not contribute to the perturbations of curvature . at the late stages of the evolution of the universe ,",
    "the axion field became massive , and its initial isocurvature perturbations were converted into a mixture of adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations , which could also have a significant nongaussian component .",
    "another model of that type describing a mixture of adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations was considered in @xcite .    however , current observational data put very strong constraints on the possible admixture of isocurvature perturbations wmap , gordon:2002gv , boom . therefore recently a special attention was payed to a class of models where a second field , called `` curvaton , '' at a certain stage begins to dominate and then decays leading essentially to a secondary stage of reheating . in this model",
    "the initial isocurvature fluctuations can be completely converted to the adiabatic ones .",
    "the spectrum of perturbations in such models can be nonflat , it can have various nonstandard features , and it can be nongaussan .",
    "this possibility was first discussed in our paper @xcite , and then it was significantly developed in the series of papers by lyth , wands @xcite , moroi and takahashi @xcite and other authors .",
    "a closely related but different mechanism was also proposed in @xcite .    at the first glance",
    ", our original model @xcite may seem extremely simple .",
    "one of its versions describes a light field @xmath4 , which fluctuates during inflation , and later begins to dominate the energy density of the universe and decays .",
    "however , the simplicity of this model , as well as of many subsequent versions of the curvaton scenario , is somewhat deceptive .",
    "such models must satisfy many specific conditions on the mass of the curvaton , on the way it decays , on the way the cmb and the baryon asymmetry of the universe are produced , etc .",
    ", see e.g. lw , gordon:2002gv , bassett:2005xm . also , the predictions of the curvaton scenario may depend on the choice of initial conditions and on our own position in the universe .",
    "this last fact , which was mentioned in @xcite , will be the main subject of our paper .",
    "most of the papers on the curvaton scenario discuss the behavior of the curvaton perturbations as a function of the classical nearly homogeneous curvaton field .",
    "meanwhile we would like to concentrate on the global structure of the universe in this scenario , in which the curvaton field may take different values in different pars of the universe due to stochastic processes during inflation .",
    "we will show that the spatial distribution of the amplitude of density perturbations in the curvaton scenario @xcite looks like a web consisting of exponentially large cells .",
    "we will call this cell structure ` the curvaton web . ' depending on the values of the parameters of the theory , the amplitude of density perturbations reaches its maximal values either in the internal parts of the cells , or near their boundaries .",
    "we will also describe a potentially important effect , which , to the best of our knowledge , was ignored in the existing literature on the curvaton perturbations .",
    "it is often assumed that the curvaton energy density is entirely due to the initial classical curvaton field and its inflationary perturbations , which also behave essentially as classical fields .",
    "however , part of the inflaton energy can be converted to the energy of curvaton particles during reheating after inflation . we will show that under certain conditions the energy density of these particles can be much greater than the energy density of the primordial curvaton field . as a result , this effect may reduce the curvaton contribution to the total amplitude of density perturbations .",
    "it may also allow to increase the degree of nongaussianity of these perturbations .",
    "finally , we will discuss the curvaton - inflaton transmutations and a possible interplay between the curvaton web and anthropic arguments related to the concept of string theory landscape .",
    "consider a theory of a scalar field @xmath5 with a mass @xmath6 , which gives a subdominant contribution to the energy density during inflation .",
    "if @xmath6 is much smaller than the hubble constant @xmath7 during inflation , the long - wavelength perturbations of this field with an average amplitude @xmath8 are generated during each time interval @xmath9 .",
    "ignoring the spatial variations of the classical field @xmath5 , which are locally unimportant but can be significant on a sufficiently large scale ( see below ) , one finds that these perturbations give rise to _ locally gaussian _ perturbations of density @xmath10 .",
    "their relative amplitude compared to the ( local ) value of the energy density of the field @xmath5 is given by @xmath11this simple equation is valid only for @xmath12 ; @xmath13 become @xmath14 for @xmath15 .    the curvaton scenario is based on the assumption that the perturbations @xmath16 can be significant .",
    "however , since this field is subdominant during inflation and shortly after it , the contribution of the curvaton fluctuations to the adiabatic perturbations of metric related to @xmath17 is much smaller than @xmath13 : @xmath18where we use the system of units @xmath19    after inflation , the inflaton field decays and produces matter .",
    "if the products of its decay are ultrarelativistic particles , then their energy density subsequently decreases as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the scale factor of the universe .",
    "meanwhile , if the field @xmath5 has a quadratic potential , then for a long time its energy density decreases more slowly .",
    "it does not decrease at all until the hubble constant becomes smaller than @xmath6 , and then it decreases as @xmath22 . as a result , the field @xmath5 may give the dominant contribution to the energy density of the universe , and its perturbations may give rise to significant perturbations of metric .",
    "if cold dark matter and baryon asymmetry are produced during a secondary stage of reheating due to the curvaton decay , then the adiabatic perturbations of density are generated , without any admixture of isocurvature perturbations @xcite .",
    "these perturbations are of the order @xmath23 . in principle",
    ", they can be much greater than the adiabatic perturbations existing at the end of inflation .",
    "two comments are in order here .",
    "first of all , particles @xmath5 can be produced during the inflaton decay at the first stage of reheating .",
    "after the moment when they become nonrelativistic , their energy density decreases in the same way as the energy density of an oscillating homogeneous field @xmath24 , and of the long - wavelength fluctuations of the curvaton field .",
    "this is an important and rather generic effect , which , to the best of our knowledge , was not discussed in the literature .",
    "it can increase the total energy density of the curvaton field at the time of its decay , and decrease the resulting amplitude of the adiabatic perturbations produced by the decaying curvaton field , see section [ reh ] .",
    "another comment concerns the origin of the classical scalar field @xmath5 in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ locgauss ] )",
    ". this field can be nearly homogeneous in the whole universe , with the value determined by initial conditions at the beginning of inflation .",
    "however , if the mass of the field is much smaller than the hubble constant during inflation , more interesting situation can be realized .",
    "namely , the fluctuations of the curvaton field produced during ( eternal ) inflation may bring the light field @xmath5 to different places in different parts of the universe . as a result , the quantity @xmath25 and the resulting amplitude of adiabatic perturbations of metric take different values in different exponentially large parts of the universe .",
    "this effect , as well as the similar effect considered in @xcite in the context of the inflationary brans - dicke cosmology , provides a possible justification to the anthropic considerations involving variable amplitude of perturbations of metric @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will describe a simplest version of the curvaton scenario proposed in @xcite , which is sufficient to explain our main idea . in the beginning , we will assume , for simplicity , that inflation occurs for a very long time , and during this time the hubble constant @xmath7 and the effective mass of the curvaton field practically did not change .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption in new inflation and in some versions of hybrid inflation . in the subsequent sections we will consider possible generalizations of these assumptions .    under the specified conditions ,",
    "the scalar field @xmath4 during the long inflationary evolution will gradually roll down towards @xmath26 , and then it will jump in all possible directions due to inflationary perturbations . in this respect",
    "our simplest model @xcite differs from the scenario where the universe is filled by a homogeneous curvaton field .",
    "as we will see in section [ chaotic ] , a generalized version of our scenario in fact describes a collection of exponentially large domains with all possible initial conditions for the field @xmath4 .",
    "however , if one calculates the average value of the field @xmath4 over the whole universe in our scenario , one finds @xmath27 .",
    "meanwhile , for @xmath28 in the simplest model with @xmath29 one finds the well - known bunch - davies expression @xcite : @xmath30 the estimate of the energy density of the fluctuations of the field @xmath4 can be obtained as follows : @xmath31    to get an intuitive understanding of this result , one should take into account that the fluctuations of the field @xmath4 with mass @xmath32 produced during each time interval @xmath33 have an average amplitude @xmath34 fluct , mukhbook , book . in the beginning",
    ", an average square of the amplitude of these fluctuations grows as @xmath35 , just like in the theory of a massless scalar field .",
    "however , the amplitude of long - wavelength fluctuations of a massive scalar field decreases as @xmath36 . therefore the amplitude of the fluctuations will start decreasing exponentially after the time @xmath37 since the moment they were produced . as a result",
    ", the main contribution to @xmath38 will be given by perturbations produced during the latest time interval @xmath39 , because all other perturbations will become exponentially small .",
    "this gives the estimate @xmath40 , which almost coincides with the bunch - davies result .",
    "note that inflationary fluctuations with @xmath41 correspond to quantum fluctuations with large occupation numbers @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "therefore these fluctuations can be interpreted as waves of a classical scalar field .",
    "the quantity @xmath43represents an average deviation of the inhomogeneous classical scalar field from zero on an exponentially large scale @xmath44 , to be discussed in the next section .",
    "if we decide , as it is commonly done , to concentrate our attention only on @xmath45 and @xmath46 , or on any other averages involving an arbitrary number of operators @xmath5 at different points , we will be unable to get a full picture of the distribution of perturbations within relevant for observations regions . in order to go beyond the simple perturbative approach",
    ", one should first remember that as a result of accumulation of the long - wavelength quantum fluctuations of the field @xmath5 , the universe becomes divided into many exponentially large regions filled with the _ positive _ field @xmath5 with the typical value @xmath47 , and many exponentially large regions containing _ negative _ field @xmath5 with the typical value @xmath48 .    in order to understand the properties of the `` curvaton landscape '' one should take into account that for the observers interested in the perturbations on the scale @xmath49 , all perturbations with the wavelength @xmath50 will look like a homogeneous field . for these perturbations , which look locally homogeneous on a scale @xmath51",
    ", we have @xmath52 one can easily check that 50% of the total banch - davies value @xmath53 is given by perturbations which look relatively homogeneous on scale smaller than @xmath54 and 90% of the banch - davies value is given by perturbations which look homogeneous on scale smaller than @xmath55 . note that the scales @xmath56 and @xmath57 are exponentially different from each other .",
    "therefore it would be incorrect to think that the universe after inflation looks like a chessboard with cells of positive and negative @xmath4 of approximately equal size @xmath58 ( or @xmath59 ) .",
    "still the logarithms of the scales @xmath60 and @xmath61 are similar and proportional to @xmath62 . in this rather vague sense",
    "we will be talking about the distribution of the curvaton field being locally homogeneous on scale @xmath63 to get a better understanding of the spatial distribution of the curvaton field we performed computer simulations of the process of formation and accumulation of the curvaton perturbations , using the methods developed in ref .",

    "[ fig : fig01 ] . the 3d distribution of the domain boundaries with @xmath26 , which we will call ` the curvaton web , ' resembles the network of domain walls in the theories with spontaneous breaking of a discrete symmetry .",
    "the main difference is that usually the domain walls have large energy density ; they exist only because of the topological reasons . in our case",
    "the situation is opposite : the potential energy density of the field @xmath4 is of the order @xmath64 inside the domains , and it vanishes at the boundaries with @xmath65 . on the other hand",
    ", the amplitude of the curvaton density perturbations behaves in a rather peculiar way near the walls with @xmath26 , see figs .",
    "[ fig : figa ] and [ fig : figb ] .    in order to evaluate the perturbations of metric ,",

    "the fluctuating field @xmath5 wanders many times in the region @xmath67 on the scale @xmath68 , so its value averaged over the domain of a size @xmath69 vanishes . as a result ,",
    "addition of a perturbation @xmath70 with @xmath71 does not lead to the usual density perturbations @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "perturbations of density will be nongaussian . to get a rough estimate of their amplitude",

    "the reason why this result is greater than the naive estimate ( [ 6i ] ) by a factor of @xmath88 is pretty simple .",
    "the estimate ( [ 6i ] ) was obtained by integration of the square of perturbations @xmath89 .",

    "the effect which we are going to consider in this section can be very essential , but it is model - dependent . in order to make our consideration as simple as possible , we will restrict ourselves to the order of magnitude estimates and assume that at the last stages of inflation the hubble constant @xmath106 the inflaton mass @xmath107 and the curvaton mass @xmath6 are roughly of the same order of magnitude .",
    "in reality , we expect that @xmath108 , but this does not alter our main conclusion .",
    "in fact , it is very easy to make our consideration more general and precise , following @xcite , but we do not want additional model - dependent complications to distract us from our main qualitative conclusion .",
    "our main assumption is that the inflaton field is in the hidden sector , and decays to all other fields only due to gravitational effects , with the decay rate @xmath109 ( in planck units @xmath110 ) .",
    "we will also assume that the curvaton field interacts only very weakly with itself and other particles , so that nonrelativistic curvaton particles produced as a result of inflaton decay do not thermalize , and decay at the same time as the classical curvaton field and its long - wavelength fluctuations generated on inflation .",
    "at the end of inflation , the energy density of the inflaton field @xmath111 is of order @xmath112 , while the energy of the fluctuations of the curvaton field @xmath5 is @xmath64 .",
    "after inflation , the energy density of the inflaton is decreasing , while the curvaton energy density remains constant until the time @xmath113 , when the long wavelength curvaton field begins to oscillate . at that time , the inflaton energy density is of order @xmath114 .",
    "starting from this moment , the ratio of the inflaton and the curvaton energy densities remains constant , until the inflaton decays .",
    "however , when @xmath6 , @xmath107 , and @xmath7 are not different , this is a minor effect . in this case",
    ", both inflaton and curvaton field begin to oscillate nearly immediately after the end of inflation when their energy densities are @xmath112 and @xmath64 respectively , and their ratio , @xmath115 is preserved until the inflaton decays .",
    "ignore for a moment that the inflaton decays to many different types of particles and suppose that its energy goes entirely to the curvaton particles . then the energy density of the curvaton particles will be greater than the energy density of the long - wavelength perturbations of the curvaton field by the factor @xmath116 .",
    "note that the constraints on the amplitude of gravitational waves during inflation implies that @xmath117 , so that @xmath118 is extremely large : @xmath119 , in planck units .",
    "that is why we were ignoring numerical factors , the difference between @xmath7 , @xmath107 and @xmath6 , etc .",
    "the main effect will be present even if we relax many of our assumptions .",
    "now let us use our estimates for calculating the curvaton contribution to the amplitude of adiabatic perturbations .",
    "this amplitude is given by @xmath120 , where @xmath121 .",
    "as for @xmath122 , in all papers on this subject this quantity is supposed to be either the energy density of the initial classical field @xmath5 or its generated long wavelength perturbations . in our scenario",
    "the typical value of this last contribution is of order @xmath123 . assuming that it dominates and , hence ,",

    "now let us take into account the curvaton production during reheating .",
    "first note that the total energy density of the produced curvaton particles can exceed the energy density of the long - wavelength fluctuations by the factor of @xmath116 , and therefore the resulting amplitude of perturbations is reduced by the factor of @xmath129 thus even if @xmath6 is comparable with @xmath7 , we can obtain nevertheless @xmath130for @xmath117 , this quantity is smaller than @xmath131 .",
    "it is well below than the level of the standard adiabatic perturbations produced by the inflaton field and even much smaller than the amplitude of the tensor perturbations @xmath132 . in other words ,",
    "the @xmath5-particles production during reheating can dramatically reduce the curvaton contribution to the final amplitude of adiabatic density perturbations making it negligibly small .    as we have noted above , one can also decrease the contribution of the curvaton perturbations into the final amplitude of the resulting adiabatic fluctuations by considering the parts of the universe with a very large classical curvaton field @xmath5 .",
    "however , if @xmath133 , then the field @xmath4 will drive chaotic inflation and will play the role of the inflaton instead of the curvaton ; see more about it in section [ chaotic ] . on the other hand , one can easily check that if @xmath134 and one ignores production of curvaton particles during reheating , then the amplitude of the curvaton contribution @xmath135 is always greater than the amplitude of tensor perturbations @xmath132 produced during inflation .    the possibility of a strong suppression of the curvaton contribution due to reheating , eq . ( [ locgausstot11 ] ) , does not mean that the final amplitude of the scalar metric perturbations can be made smaller than the amplitude of the tensor perturbations .",
    "if the contribution of the isocurvature curvaton mode is too small , then the resulting amplitude of metric perturbations is determined by the usual adiabatic perturbations produced by the inflaton field @xcite .",
    "as we already mentioned , the results obtained above are strongly model dependent .",
    "one can easily avoid suppression of the curvaton perturbations by changing the assumptions about the mechanism of reheating .",
    "the main goal of this consideration was to show that in the calculations of the curvaton perturbations , in addition to the energy of a classical curvaton field and its long - wavelength inflationary perturbations one should also consider the energy of the curvaton particles produced during reheating .",
    "this contribution may be either negligible , or extremely important , as in the case described above .",
    "since the importance of the effect is model - dependent , we will describe it phenomenologically by modifying the equation for the curvaton contribution to the amplitude of ( locally gaussian ) density perturbations as @xmath136here @xmath5 is the locally measured amplitude of the classical curvaton field and @xmath137 is a phenomenological parameter proportional to the energy density of the curvaton particles produced during reheating .    for @xmath138 and",
    "@xmath139 this equation reproduces our previous result @xmath140 , but as we have seen above , under certain conditions the constant @xmath137 may be quite large , which leads to a decrease of the amplitude of the curvaton contribution to density perturbations , and to a different dependence of this amplitude on the local value of the field @xmath5 . for @xmath141 , the amplitude of the density perturbations does not blow up at @xmath65 , as before .",
    "it reaches its maximum at @xmath142 : @xmath143    one of the interesting consequences of this result is that even if one ignores the effects of the curvaton web , one can still obtain strongly nongaussian perturbations generated by the curvaton mechanism .",
    "indeed , usually the amplitude of the locally gaussian fluctuations was supposed to be @xmath144 .",
    "the smallness of this ratio implied that the level of nongaussianity was expected to be extremely small ( quadratic in @xmath25 ) .",
    "however , with an account taken of the curvaton particles produced during reheating , one can obtain a small amplitude of density perturbations even if @xmath145 .",
    "this may substantially increase the level of nongaussianity of adiabatic perturbations produced by the curvatons .",
    "in other words , our ignorance of the specific mechanism of curvaton production during reheating makes the degree of nongaussianity in the curvaton scenario a free parameter .",
    "finally we should note that eq .",
    "( [ locgausstot11a ] ) is valid in a more general case , if during the curvaton decay there were other particles , giving contribution @xmath146 to the total energy density during the curvaton decay .",
    "we concentrated on the case where this contribution is dominated by the curvaton particles , since in this case one does not get any undesirable isocurvature perturbations if cdm , baryon and lepton asymmetry are generated either by the curvaton decay or after it .",
    "one can also avoid the isocurvature perturbations even if the energy density during the curvaton decay is dominated by radiation , under the assumption that cdm , baryon and lepton asymmetry are produced after the curvaton decay , but not due to the curvaton decay @xcite .",
    "the observational consequences of our scenario depend on relations between the typical size of the curvaton domain @xmath147 the size of the observable part of the universe @xmath1 and a typical galaxy scale @xmath148 ( recalculated to the end of inflation ) .",
    "as we have seen in the previous section , effects of reheating may allow us to have a small amplitude of locally gaussian density perturbations not only for @xmath7 many orders of magnitude greater than @xmath6 , but also for @xmath106 which is only a few times greater than @xmath6 .",
    "this means that , depending on the ratio between @xmath7 and @xmath6 , a typical size of each domain with a positive or negative @xmath5 , @xmath149 , can take values either much smaller or much greater than the scale of horizon @xmath1 .",
    "we will mention here two interesting regimes :    if @xmath150 , the perturbations are strongly nongaussian , which contradicts observational data . on the other hand ,",
    "if the amplitude of these fluctuations is subdominant compared to the usual adiabatic inflationary perturbations , then one can use this regime as providing a small controllable amount of nongaussian isocurvature and adiabatic perturbations @xcite .",
    "the existence of the curvaton web helps to understand the origin of this nongaussianity .",
    "if @xmath151 , we live in a part of the universe dominated by nearly gaussian adiabatic perturbations . for a proper choice of parameters ,",
    "such a possibility is consistent with all available observational data .",
    "a nontrivial part of this scenario is that the amplitude of adiabatic perturbations depends not only on the parameters of the model , but also on the local value of the curvaton field at the end of inflation , which can vary from @xmath152 to @xmath153 in different parts of the universe .",
    "this helps to justify anthropic considerations comparing the properties of the universe with different values of the amplitude of density perturbations . in this respect , this scenario is similar to the scenario studied in linde:1989tz , where the amplitude of density perturbations could take different values in different parts of the universe due to inflationary perturbations of the brans - dicke field .",
    "recently this possibility was studied in @xcite in relation to the anthropic principle and string landscape scenario .",

    "the picture of the curvaton web allows not only to discuss various probability distributions , but also to have a visual understanding of the structure of the universe in this scenario .",
    "the details of this picture depend on creation of @xmath5-particles during reheating discussed in the previous section . in the case @xmath138 considered in section [ web ] ( no curvaton particle production during reheating ) , the maximum of density perturbations @xmath154 is reached near the walls @xmath65 separating the exponentially large domains with positive and negative values of @xmath5 . however , for @xmath155 , the maximum would correspond to a finite value @xmath156 ( see eq .",
    "( [ locgausstot11a ] ) ) . if @xmath157 , then the amplitude of density perturbations will take its largest values deep inside these domains , when @xmath158 , and it will be minimal near the walls with @xmath65 .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath159 , then the amplitude of density perturbations will be small inside the domains , it will grow on the way towards the walls with @xmath65 , but then it will reach some maximal value and vanish near the walls with @xmath65 .",
    "this means that the places where the amplitude of density perturbations is maximal form two walls surrounding from each side the wall with @xmath65 .",
    "thus the effects of reheating may affect in a rather nontrivial way the structure of the curvaton web .",
    "our results are illustrated by a set of two figures , which show the spatial distribution of the square of the amplitude of the curvaton density perturbations based on computer simulations of the curvaton web for @xmath159 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : figa ] and fig .",

    "these two figures show why did we call the resulting structure ` the curvaton web . '",
    "= 7.4 cm-1 cm       = 7.4 cm       these figures clearly explain the main source of nongaussianity in the curvaton scenario of ref .",
    "they also suggest a rather exotic possibility which may occur if we live not very far from the walls shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figa ] . in this case",
    "the amplitude of density perturbations will be slightly different at the two opposite parts of the sky , depending on the distance from the nearby wall .",
    "until now we were assuming that the hubble constant and the mass of the curvaton field remain constant during inflation .",
    "this possibility can be realized , for example , in new or hybrid inflation . in chaotic inflation",
    "the hubble constant changes significantly during inflation . moreover , the curvaton mass can depend on the curvature , @xmath160 , see @xcite . in this section",
    "we consider how the results obtained in the previous sections are modified in this case .",
    "we will also assume , as in the previous sections , that initially the scalar field @xmath5 was small ; for a discussion of a more general situation see @xcite and also the end of section [ constant ] .",
    "we consider the model where inflation is driven by the field @xmath111 with an effective potential @xmath161 and assume that the curvaton mass is much smaller than the hubble constant during inflation , that is @xmath162 . in this case",

    "@xmath5 which is homogeneous on the scale @xmath99 and which has a typical amplitude @xmath185    as we see , the value of @xmath186 depends on the initial value of the field @xmath111 .",
    "this result has the following interpretation .",
    "one may consider an inflationary domain of initial size @xmath187 .",
    "this domain after inflation becomes exponentially large . in the model with @xmath188",
    "its size becomes @xcite @xmath189one can easily check that the largest contribution to @xmath190 is given by perturbations with the wavelength @xmath191 .",
    "if one takes @xmath192 , a typical amplitude of the field @xmath24 becomes much greater than @xmath14 in planck units , which means that this field becomes capable of supporting chaotic inflation .",
    "one may call this effect ` the curvaton - inflaton transmutation . '    in this regime the field @xmath5 typically serves as an inflaton rather than as a curvaton .",
    "indeed , in this case we consider two fields , @xmath111 and @xmath5 , in a universe with a hubble constant determined by a total energy density of both fields .",
    "their combined dynamics can be easily understood in the approximation @xmath193 . in this case",
    "@xmath194 , whereas @xmath195 .",
    "obviously , for @xmath196 the field @xmath24 practically does not change until inflationary stage driven by the field @xmath111 is over .",
    "after that , the field @xmath5 drives subsequent stages of inflation , producing usual inflaton perturbations with amplitude @xmath197    thus , if the field @xmath111 was originally greater than @xmath198 , then the last stage of inflation is driven by the lightest field @xmath5 .",
    "this happens even if the initial value of @xmath5 is smaller than the planck value ; see @xcite for a related discussion .    until now we were assuming that the scalar field @xmath111 obeys classical evolution described by eq .",
    "( [ a5 ] ) . however , if @xmath199 then inflation is eternal @xcite .",
    "thus in eternal inflation scenario based on the model with two fields , the last stage of inflation is typically driven by the lightest field . in other words ,",
    "the lightest field @xmath200 typically is not a curvaton but an inflaton .",
    "moreover , even if eternal inflation is initially supported only by the field @xmath111 , in some parts of the universe the quantum fluctuations bring this field higher and higher , up to the planck density . in those regions ,",
    "the hubble constant grows up to the planck value @xmath201 , and @xmath190 eventually becomes @xmath202the energy density of the fluctuations of the field @xmath5 also approaches planck density : @xmath203 .",
    "this is not surprising ; in fact this always happens in the eternal inflation scenario based on the simplest chaotic inflation which allows the nearly planckian energy density @xcite .",
    "but this means that as a result of quantum fluctuations produced during eternal inflation , the scalar field @xmath5 typically becomes much greater than the field @xmath111 .",
    "indeed , the field @xmath5 can take any value in the interval @xmath204 , in planck units .",
    "later on , the field @xmath111 rolls down faster , and the last stage of inflation is eventually driven by the lighter field @xmath5 .",
    "how these results depend on the choice of the inflaton potential @xmath205 ? assuming that during inflation driven by the field @xmath111 the curvaton mass @xmath6 is negligibly small compared to the hubble constant , and the ratio @xmath206 grows at large @xmath111 , we obtain from ( [ a6 ] ) the following estimate for @xmath207 at the end of the inflation:@xmath208therefore if at the beginning of inflation ( i.e. at @xmath209 ) the condition @xmath210is satisfied , then @xmath211 , and the curvaton @xmath212 becomes an inflaton .",
    "it is easy to verify that , for example , for the power - law potential @xmath213 the condition of self - reproduction,@xmath214coincides with ( [ a10 ] ) . therefore all results which we derived for the massive inflaton potential are valid in this case as well .",
    "thus we are coming to the conclusion that if eternal inflation takes place in our model ( or if the field @xmath5 was greater than @xmath14 from the very beginning ) , then the scalar field @xmath5 typically becomes extremely large and plays the role of the inflaton rather than the curvaton .",
    "we will return to this conclusion and its consequences in section [ landscape ] .",
    "another interesting case is when the curvaton mass squared during inflation is proportional to the curvature @xmath217 @xcite .",
    "mass terms @xmath218 appear in many models of supergravity , and also in the models of the field @xmath5 non - minimally coupled to gravity . substituting @xmath219 in ( [ a6 ] ) , we obtain@xmath220for the case of the power - law potential @xmath221 the integral in ( [ a12 ] ) can be calculated exactly .",
    "in particular , for @xmath222 we obtain@xmath223 in the case @xmath224 , this expression simplifies to @xmath225by taking @xmath226 , we reproduce our previous result ( [ a8 ] ) for the amplitude of perturbations of the field @xmath4 at the end of inflation driven by the field @xmath227 . therefore ,",
    "for @xmath228 , the mass term @xmath229 is irrelevant at the self - reproduction scale @xmath230 and below . as a result",
    ", in this regime the curvaton @xmath200 typically becomes an inflaton and drives the last stages of inflation .",
    "on the other hand , for sufficiently large @xmath178 , the behavior of the curvaton filed in chaotic inflation is well described by the model with constant @xmath6 and @xmath7 considered in section [ pert ] . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath231 , then , as soon the field @xmath111 becomes much smaller than @xmath232 , one can neglect the last term in ( [ a13 ] ) , and the result becomes@xmath233for @xmath234 we have@xmath235thus , the distribution of the field @xmath5 behaves as a bunch - davies distribution for a field with an adiabatically decreasing mass @xmath236 .",
    "a typical dispersion of the field @xmath5 slowly decreases , remaining of the order @xmath237 .",
    "this result is easy to understand . as it was shown in section [ pert ] , the bunch - davies distribution ( [ 1ae ] ) is established during the time @xmath238 .",
    "all results obtained in section [ pert ] will remain valid at all stages of inflation where the hubble constant did not change much during the time @xmath239 .",
    "one can show that this is equivalent to the condition @xmath240this adiabatic regime ends when @xmath241 becomes smaller than @xmath242 .",
    "thus , at the last stages of inflation eq .",
    "( [ a14 ] ) yields @xmath243note that if @xmath244 then @xmath245 , and the curvaton does not become an inflaton .",
    "as we have shown in @xcite , the slope of the spectrum of curvaton perturbations produced in this model depends on the parameter @xmath246 .",
    "if @xmath247 , the spectrum will be nearly flat , and perturbations will be locally gaussian . if @xmath246 is sufficiently large , then the typical size of the cells of the curvaton web become small , the perturbations become strongly nongaussian , and they may have blue spectrum .",
    "we should emphasize again that the curvaton perturbations appear _ in addition _ to the usual adiabatic perturbations produced by the inflaton fluctuations . by combining these two contributions",
    ", one can obtain adiabatic perturbations with a controllable degree of nongaussianity .",
    "also , since each of these two contributions has its own spectral index , a combination of these two spectra may look like a spectrum with a running spectral index .",
    "in this section we will discuss an additional reason to be interested in the curvaton models and the curvaton web .    with the development of inflationary scenario it became clear that the universe may consist of exponentially large number of exponentially large locally homogeneous domains of different types , which allowed us for the first time to obtain a scientific justification of anthropic principle linde:1984je , eternal , llm , mediocr , garcia - bellido:1994ci .",
    "this possibility became especially interesting when it was realized that string theory may have an enormously large number of different vacua kklt , bp , susskind:2003kw , douglas .",
    "one may wonder where is our place in the vast stringy landscape ?",
    "the first thing to say is that we simply can not live in most of these vacua .",
    "for example , we can not live in a non - compactified 10d space even if its total volume is extremely large .",
    "this is a simple superselection rule .",
    "one may try to go further and evaluate the probability of emergence of life in a world with different masses and coupling constants .",
    "this is what was traditionally done by those who explored various consequences of anthropic principle prior to invention of inflationary cosmology .",
    "inflation allows us to look at this problem from a different perspective .",
    "one may assume that we are typical observers , and the total number of observers is proportional to the total volume of the universe .",
    "therefore the probability to live in a part of the universe with given properties depends not only on these properties , but also on the volume of this part of the universe as compared to the volume of other parts .",
    "since volume is exponentially sensitive to parameters of inflationary theory and initial conditions for inflation , investigation of the volume - weighted probability distribution of different parts of the universe can give us a very powerful tool for understanding of our place in the universe .",
    "the volume - weighted probability distribution in inflationary cosmology was introduced in @xcite .",
    "a detailed investigation of this probability distribution and its applications to anthropic principle was performed in @xcite , which was followed by many other works on this subject , see e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "there are many problems related to the use of this probability distribution , including the choice of a proper probability measure and a general issue of its interpretation",
    ". these issues could seem abstract and academical , but recently the situation changed .",
    "after the invention of the mechanism of moduli stabilization in string theory and the development of the concept of string theory landscape @xcite the problem of the choice of a most probable vacuum state became one of the most important problems of modern physics .",
    "many string theorists and cosmologists began actively debating this question .",
    "it is not our goal to discuss all of these issues in this paper . here",
    "we will only mention one aspect of this problem related to the curvaton web .    to explain the basic issue ,",
    "let us consider , following @xcite , the simplest class of inflationary models with a potential @xmath248 , which we discussed in sect .",
    "[ chaotic ] . during the rolling of this field from its initial value @xmath175",
    "the universe expands as @xmath249 , see eq .",
    "( [ 8aab ] ) .",
    "suppose inflation began at the planck boundary @xmath250 .",
    "then , ignoring the issues of eternal inflation , the volume of the universe during inflation in this scenario grows @xmath251 times .",
    "if instead of that we assume that inflation begins at the eternal inflation boundary @xmath252 , one finds that the volume of the universe grows by a factor of @xmath253 . in either case , the total volume of the universe after inflation grows exponentially when @xmath107 decreases .",
    "thus if the inflaton mass @xmath107 can take different values in different parts of the universe , one may argue that the parts with a smaller @xmath107 will be exponentially bigger , so they will contain exponentially greater number of observers , and therefore a typical observer will live in a part of the universe with the smallest possible inflaton mass .",
    "on the other hand , the amplitude of density perturbations produced in this scenario is @xcite @xmath254 at the end of chaotic inflation , where @xmath255 .",
    "since the volume of the parts of the universe produced by inflation is exponentially sensitive to the value of @xmath107 , one may argue that it would be exponentially more probable to live in the universe with the amplitude of density perturbations much smaller than its present value .",
    "this is a serious problem , which was especially clearly described in ref .",
    "@xcite on the basis of a combined analysis of the probability distribution for the cosmological constant and the amplitude of density perturbations .",
    "one should note that this problem appears mostly because of the assumption that the probability to live in a given part of the universe is proportional to the degree of inflation .",
    "while this is a reasonable assumption @xcite , its validity is not absolutely clear ; see e.g. a discussion in @xcite .",
    "in particular , if one uses the probability measure associated with the volume at the hypersurface of time measured in units of @xmath99 , which was one of the two possible measures advocated in @xcite , then the resulting probability distribution does not contain any factors of the type of @xmath256 .",
    "in addition , we do not actually know whether it makes any sense to compare different causally disconnected parts of the universe with different parameters @xcite .",
    "these issues deserve a separate investigation , which goes beyond the scope of the present paper . still , with all of these uncertainties in mind , the problem described above should not be discarded . in order to resolve this problem ,",
    "it was suggested in @xcite that the cosmological perturbations of metric should be produced not by the inflaton field but by cosmic strings , in which case the amplitude of perturbations does not depend on @xmath107 and on the duration of inflation .",
    "this possibility by now is ruled out by cosmological observations .",
    "therefore in @xcite it was proposed to use the curvaton mechanism of generation of density perturbations .",
    "the main idea is that in the simplest versions of this scenario @xmath257 , see eq .",
    "( [ locgauss ] ) .",
    "this amplitude does not depend on the mass of the inflaton field , so one can maximize the amount of inflation by minimizing @xmath107 , without affecting @xmath258 .",
    "one of the problems with this proposal is that in this scenario the probability to live in the universe with the amplitude of density perturbations greater than some given value @xmath258 , and with the anthropic constraints imposed on the combination of @xmath258 and the cosmological constant @xmath259 , is proportional to @xmath260 garriga:2005ee .",
    "this result suggests that we should live in the universe with @xmath261 , which also disagrees with the observational data . in order to avoid this problem",
    "it was suggested to consider more complicated , multi - component curvaton models @xcite .    in this respect ,",
    "our investigation of the curvaton web brings both good and bad news .",
    "the good news is that if one takes into account production of the curvaton particles during reheating , then the amplitude of the curvaton perturbations does not blow up at small @xmath4 .",
    "instead it has a maximal value given by @xmath262 , see eq .",
    "( [ locgausstot11ab ] ) .",
    "this would be consistent with observations for @xmath263 .",
    "the bad news is that this idea requires a specific carefully tuned mechanism of reheating after inflation .",
    "moreover , this idea does not work at all in the simplest curvaton models .",
    "for example , as pointed out in section [ chaotic ] , in the eternal inflation scenario in the model with the curvaton potential @xmath264 and the inflaton potential @xmath265 , the field @xmath200 typically plays the role of the inflaton instead of the curvaton .",
    "one can avert this conclusion by considering the field @xmath4 with the mass @xmath266 with a sufficiently large @xmath246 , as we did in @xcite ; see section [ alpha ] .",
    "but this makes the model more complicated and prompts to look for alternatives ideas .",
    "the simplest way to obtain @xmath267 is to add the term @xmath268 to the lagrangian .",
    "but if one does it for the curvaton , one may do it for the inflaton as well . by adding the term @xmath269 to the einstein lagrangian @xmath270",
    ", one would make it impossible for the field @xmath111 to be greater than @xmath271 because the effective gravitational constant @xmath272 becomes singular at @xmath273 . in this model",
    "the maximal amount of inflation can be estimated by @xmath274 .",
    "this quantity no longer depends on @xmath107 , so the whole problem discussed in mediocr , feldstein:2005bm , garriga:2005ee disappears .",
    "more generally , this problem arises only because the models considered in @xcite depend on a single parameter , such as the inflaton mass @xmath107 , or a coupling constant @xmath275 in the potential @xmath276 .",
    "as we just mentioned , this problem disappears if we add a second parameter , @xmath277 , and keep it fixed . of course",
    ", one may argue that this parameter must be minimized in its turn , in order to maximize the degree of inflation .",
    "but with each such step the reliability of the basic arguments becomes less certain .    in this respect",
    ", it is quite instructive to consider a different modification of the theory .",
    "let us add a constant @xmath278 to the potential @xmath265 , and assume that inflation ends when the field @xmath227 reaches some point @xmath279 with @xmath280 , as it happens in the hybrid inflation scenario @xcite . in this case , as before , the total duration of inflation will be determined by the behavior of the universe at extremely large @xmath227 , where @xmath281 .",
    "this duration will be almost the same as in the simple model @xmath265 .",
    "meanwhile the amplitude of density perturbations during the last 60 e - folds will be determined by inflation in the regime @xmath282 , and it will be proportional to @xmath283 @xcite : @xmath284 in this case one would have another problem : long duration of inflation , as before , favors small @xmath107 , but now small @xmath107 lead to unacceptably _",
    "density perturbations .",
    "so what is the problem ? is it an unacceptably _ small _ density perturbations , as in the model @xmath265 , or an unacceptably _ large _ density perturbations , as in the model @xmath285 ?",
    "the root of this ambiguity is easy to understand .",
    "the degree of inflation in this scenario is determined by the shape of the potential at extremely large @xmath227 , whereas the amplitude of density perturbations is determined by the shape of the potential at relatively small @xmath227 .",
    "the problem discussed in @xcite appears only if one believes that the shape of the inflaton potential is determined by a single parameter and does not change during an incredibly large interval of variation of the inflaton field .",
    "we do not think that this requirement is generically satisfied by inflationary models in stringy landscape .    the simplest way to address this problem is to maximize the total amount of inflation by properly tuning the part of the potential describing the main part of the process of inflation ( which corresponds to @xmath286 in the simplest chaotic inflation models ) , and then tune the part describing the last 60 e - folds of inflation by tuning the remaining part of the potential ( @xmath287 in our example ) .",
    "as our example shows , one can easily tune the amplitude of perturbations of metric anywhere in the interval from @xmath152 to @xmath14 without altering the early stage of inflation which is responsible for the total degree of inflation .",
    "therefore we believe that it would be somewhat premature to use anthropic considerations for justification of the curvaton scenario .",
    "in this paper we discussed the global structure of the universe in the simplest curvaton scenario proposed in our paper @xcite .",
    "this scenario is based on the theory of two massive scalar fields , the inflaton @xmath227 and the curvaton @xmath4 , interacting with each other only gravitationally .",
    "we have shown that stochastic processes during eternal inflation in this scenario divide the universe into many exponentially large domains containing either positive or negative values of the curvaton field @xmath4 .",
    "the amplitude of the curvaton perturbations in this scenario depends on the process of reheating after inflation and has a rather nontrivial behavior as a function of the distance from the walls @xmath26 separating the domains with positive and negative @xmath4 .",
    "we called the resulting structure , which was shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : figa ] , [ fig : figb ] , ` the curvaton web .

    ", one may relax many constraints imposed by the requirement of a secondary reheating and creation of dark matter and baryons after the curvaton decay , and instead of the adiabatic perturbations produced by the decaying curvaton study a small admixture of isocurvature nongaussian perturbations .",
    "moreover , in different parts of the universe the same scalar fields may play either the role of the curvaton or the role of the inflation ; the effect which we called ` the curvaton - inflaton transmutation . '",
    "this example shows that in addition to a _",
    "discrete _ spectrum of possibilities , which appear after compactification in string landscape scenario , one may have a _ continuous _ spectrum of possibilities , which appear because of a complicated dynamics in the early universe .",
    "the availability of so many new possibilities is encouraging , but also rather disturbing .",
    "the curvaton scenario is much more complicated than the usual scenario where the adiabatic perturbations are produced by the inflaton fluctuations , so we believe that it should be used sparingly . on the other hand , in certain situations the curvaton scenario can be quite useful .",
    "in particular , it provides by far the simplest way to obtain a controllable amount of nongaussian perturbations of metric @xcite .",

    "<S> we show that the curvaton contribution to the total amplitude of adiabatic density perturbations can be strongly suppressed if the energy density of the universe prior to the curvaton decay was dominated not by the classical curvaton field but by the curvaton particles produced during reheating . </S>",
    "<S> we describe the curvaton - inflaton transmutation effect : the same field in different parts of the universe may play either the role of the curvaton or the role of the inflaton . </S>",
