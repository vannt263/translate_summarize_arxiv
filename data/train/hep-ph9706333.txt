    "<S> it has recently been shown that strong interactions underlying electroweak symmetry breaking will induce four - fermion amplitudes proportional to @xmath0 , which in turn will influence a variety of flavor changing processes . </S>",

    "<S> recently attention has focused on a particular term in this effective lagrangian which induces corrections proportional to @xmath0 in charged current interactions @xcite . integrating out </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 quark then yields interesting effects in the down - type quark sector , inducing corrections to @xmath2 and @xmath3@xmath4 mixing @xcite , and various rare @xmath5 and @xmath6 decays @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all these effects are correlated since they are related to one parameter in the effective lagrangian @xcite .    in this note </S>",
    "<S> we will provide an estimate of the size of the new parameter , expressed in terms of the number of new fermion doublets in some underlying theory of electroweak symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> such an estimate in the case of the @xmath7 parameter proved useful to constrain technicolor theories . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath7 parameter is related to a term in an effective lagrangian with coefficient @xmath8 which is completely analogous to the @xmath9 term appearing at order @xmath10 in the low energy qcd chiral lagrangian @xcite . since @xmath9 is a measured quantity , an estimate for @xmath7 </S>",
    "<S> is thereby obtained @xcite for qcd - like technicolor theories .    </S>",
    "<S> the situation is somewhat different for the parameter of interest here , which is the coefficient of another term appearing at order @xmath10 . in the qcd case </S>",
    "<S> this coefficient is not a measurable quantity since the term can be removed by the equations of motion . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately in the qcd case there are quark models which model the chiral symmetry breaking and which quite successfully reproduce the values of all ten measured parameters , @xmath11@xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> such models can then be expected to provide a reasonable estimate of the new parameter , which we will refer to as @xmath13 ( corresponding to @xmath14 in @xcite and @xmath15 in @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> a naive quark model may be based on the nonlinear sigma model where effects of a single quark loop are considered . </S>",
    "<S> this does a fair job of reproducing those @xmath16 s which happen to correspond to convergent loop integrals @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a more sophisticated quark - based approach leads to the extraction of all ten parameters @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most convenient for our purposes is the gauged nonlocal constituent ( gnc ) quark model @xcite , which incorporates the momentum dependence expected for dynamically generated fermion masses . </S>",
    "<S> in qcd the mass function is known to fall as the square of the momentum ( up to logarithms ) for large momentum . </S>",
    "<S> the gnc model can incorporate such momentum dependence in an manner which preserves the local chiral symmetries of the underlying theory . </S>",
    "<S> the mass function then naturally regulates the loop integrals , and successful values for @xmath11@xmath12 are obtained . </S>",
    "<S> here we are interested in @xmath13 and its sensitivity to the choice of mass function .    </S>",
    "<S> we will focus on the following two terms in the chiral lagrangian , @xmath17 with @xmath18{,\\nonumber}\\\\&&{l_{\\mu \\nu } } = { { \\partial}_{\\mu } } { l_{\\nu } }   - { { \\partial}_{\\nu } } { l_{\\mu } } - [ { l_{\\mu } } ,   { l_{\\nu } } ] { , \\nonumber}\\\\&&{l_{\\mu } } = ( { v_{\\mu } ^a } - { a_{\\mu } ^a})\\sigma ^{a},{\\ \\ \\ } { r_{\\mu } } = ( { v_{\\mu } ^a } + { a_{\\mu } ^a } ) \\sigma ^{a}{.\\nonumber}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by identifying @xmath19 with weak gauge fields @xmath20 and using the equation of motion for @xmath21 the @xmath13 term can be transformed into a sum of 4-quark operators , which include the following charged current interaction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath22 @xmath23 are the ckm matrix elements </S>",
    "<S> .    the chiral symmetry breaking physics in the underlying theory will produce finite contributions to the @xmath12 and @xmath13 coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> these coefficients become running couplings within the effective theory , and the finite values we are referring to correspond to the values renormalized at the chiral symmetry breaking scale . </S>",
    "<S> these values may be determined by choosing some convenient amplitude and using that to match the effective theory onto the underlying theory ( or at least a model of the underlying theory ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we shall consider the two - point function @xmath24 where the only contributions from the order @xmath10 chiral lagrangian are from @xmath12 and @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath25 the naive quark loop yields @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the number of fermion doublets contributing in the loop .    </S>",
    "<S> the couplings of the gauge fields to the fermions in the gnc model are the following , where @xmath28 is the dynamical fermion mass function . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath29{\\nonumber}\\\\&&{\\ \\ \\ \\ } - i[({q_{1 } } , \\mu , a)^{{}}{\\   \\leftrightarrow\\ } ( { q_{2 } } , \\nu , b)^{{}}]\\\\&&{\\gamma _ { { \\it aa}}^{\\mu \\nu </S>",

    "<S> @xmath31 for @xmath32 , the naive quark loop result is obtained , whereas qcd is better modeled by a value of @xmath33 closer to unity .    </S>",
    "<S> we plot @xmath34 and @xmath35 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) as a function of @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath36 we see that @xmath37 is more than twice as large as the naive quark loop result , which brings it into line with the measured qcd value @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath38 on the other hand shows surprisingly little sensitivity to @xmath33 , and its value for all @xmath33 is close to @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> term in those references is defined differently so that it appears in ( [ b ] ) with the opposite sign . </S>",
    "<S> ] we also checked other functional forms for @xmath28 and found that @xmath38 is generally quite insensitive to the momentum dependence of the fermion mass function .    in @xcite and </S>",
    "<S> @xcite it was argued that the experimental constraints from @xmath2 and @xmath3@xmath4 mixing imply that @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> but we now see that this limit is far above what we could reasonably expect . </S>",
    "<S> our results imply that the limit is saturated for @xmath41 , which is clearly impossible given the constraint on @xmath27 from @xmath7 . to put it another way , </S>",
    "<S> if we assume that a heavy fourth family ( @xmath42 ) is still allowed by the constraint on @xmath7 , then the contribution to @xmath13 is only @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the shifts in the various rare @xmath5 and @xmath6 decay modes from standard model values as described @xcite would then be less than 5% .    while our models of strong interactions are admittedly simple - minded , they strongly suggest that the effects of @xmath13 will be very difficult to observe given the constraints on @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that if flavor changing effects beyond the standard model are seen , they will likely have more to do with the physics responsible for quark and lepton masses rather than the physics responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking . </S>"
