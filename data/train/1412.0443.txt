    "an important role of the reservoir of nonradiative excitons was recently recognized for semiconductor microcavities where strong light - matter coupling accelerates the exchange between radiative and nonradiative states  @xcite . in conventional qw structures ,",
    "all the dynamic processes are slowed down compared to microcavities , that favors considerable accumulation of nonradiative excitons .",
    "the effect of these excitons on the radiative ones may be significant .",
    "nonradiative excitons can be created even at the strictly resonant excitation of the lowest exciton transition if the phonon energy corresponding to the lattice temperature is larger than the critical energy @xmath10",
    "the in - plane component of the phonon wave vector , @xmath11 , is transferred to the exciton due to the conservation of momentum that results in ejection of this exciton outside the light cone .    for excitons localized by structure defects as well as for excitons scattered by free carriers , phonons and other excitons ,",
    "the number of atomic oscillators contributing to the exciton oscillator strength is reduced as compared to the free exciton . the radiative decay rate for such excitons may decrease , by up to two orders of magnitude  @xcite .",
    "besides , structure imperfections may induce additional relaxation processes for radiative as well as for nonradiative excitons .",
    "in particular , the defect centers or the qw interface roughness may give rise to the considerable inhomogeneous broadening of exciton resonances and to the nonradiative exciton recombination .",
    "for this reason , many attempts were done to study the exciton dynamics in gaas - based heterostructures of various sample quality .",
    "the exciton dynamics was extensively studied using the photoluminescence ( pl ) kinetics measurements . under nonresonant excitation , the pl pulse is characterized by a rise time , @xmath12  ps , and a decay time , @xmath13  ns , depending on the experimental conditions as well as on the sample design and quality  @xcite .",

    "the slowest exciton dynamics process is the scattering of nonradiative excitons into the light cone .",
    "this momentum relaxation process is responsible for the pl decay .",
    "a large spread of the decay time  @xcite is possibly caused by the competition of the momentum relaxation with losses of nonradiative excitons via quenching centers in real structures .",

    "results of these studies also reveal large variations of the exciton recombination time in the range 1  30  ps , most probably due to the different quality of the investigated structures .",
    "the large spread of experimental data on the exciton relaxation times in structures with qws points out that the reliable data on characteristic rates of the relaxation processes both for radiative and for nonradiative excitons can be obtained only by the careful selection of high - quality qw structures and in specific experimental conditions .    in this paper ,",
    "we report on the experimental study of the dynamics of radiative and nonradiative exciton states in a specially designed high - quality heterostructure with a relatively wide ingaas / gaas qw of about 95  nm width .",
    "the peculiarity of this structure is in the presence of a set of the quantum confined exciton states , which manifest themselves as the ultra - narrow lines in the pl and reflection spectra .",
    "the pl spectra and the kinetics of pump - probe signal were measured under resonant excitation into one of the quantum confined states that allowed us to carefully control the excitation conditions .",
    "a comparative analysis of pl and reflectance spectra and of kinetics data has been performed for reliable identification of relaxation processes and extraction of their parameters . in particular ,",
    "our analysis has shown that the dominant decay process for excitons at the lowest energy level is the radiative recombination for the case of low temperature and low excitation power .",
    "we have found that the kinetics of pump - probe signal for the lowest exciton state exhibits , besides the fast component corresponding to the radiative exciton decay , a slow component , whose decay time is longer by three orders of magnitude .",
    "the long - lived component of the kinetics is caused by the relaxation of nonradiative excitons from the reservoir to the light cone .",
    "we have also identified other relaxation processes in the exciton system under study . in particular , we have found that the increase of excitation density is followed by the enhancement of the exciton - exciton and/or exciton - carrier collisions which broaden exciton lines in the pl spectra . at the same time , the temperature - activated rapid quenching of the pl intensity does not accompanied by any noticeable broadening of exciton lines . we attribute this unusual effect to the thermal dissociation of nonradiative excitons in the reservoir followed by the nonradiative losses of the excitation energy .",

    "there is a gradient of the layer thicknesses of about 10% per cm and the indium content varies from 1.5 to 2 % in the structure so that the real thickness and potential profile of the wide qw were estimated from spectroscopic data .",

    "the sample temperature was varied in the range of 4  30 k.    the pl was excited by radiation of a tunable continuous - wave ti : sapphire laser .",

    "the probe pulses were spectrally broad and short , of about 0.1  ps . to detect the time - resolved photomodulated reflection at different exciton transitions ,",
    "the spectrum of reflected probe beam was analyzed using a 0.55 m spectrometer equipped with a photodiode .",

    "the temperature dependence of @xmath109 is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) .",
    "as seen this rate strongly increases at @xmath121  k and then drops again .",
    "such behavior can not be explained by the exciton - phonon scattering because the rate of this scattering should monotonically depend on temperature in the range under study ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "possible physical mechanism of the exciton ejection will be discussed in the next section .",
    "figure [ fig5](b ) shows the spectral dependence of differential reflection measured at the time delay 30  ps when only the slow component persists .",
    "the pump pulses were spectrally narrow as shown in the figure .",
    "although the spectral position of the pump pulses has been chosen to excite predominantly the lowest exciton level , the non - zero signal is observed in the wide spectral range up to the light - hole ( @xmath72 ) exciton transition .",
    "@xmath35w . ]    temperature variations of the pump - probe signal are shown in fig .",
    "one can see that a considerable signal appears at the negative delay where the probe pulse tests the sample before the pump pulse arrives .",
    "the temperature rise from 4  k to 12  k causes a considerable rise of this signal , which then drops at further increase of the temperature .",
    "the presence of the pump - probe signal at negative delays indicates that the characteristic relaxation time of the slow component , @xmath122 , exceeds the repetition period of excitation pulses ( @xmath123  ns ) . as a result",
    ", the detected signal is accumulated from many preceding pump pulses . in the case of exponential decay of the signal ,",
    "the amplitude of the slow component created by a single pulse becomes just before coming the next pulse equal to : @xmath124 .",
    "the total signal for all the preceding pulses can be easily calculated as a sum of the geometric progression : @xmath125 $ ] .",
    "this expression allows us to roughly estimate the relaxation time @xmath122 using the experimentally measured ratio @xmath126 .",
    "time @xmath122 increases from 15  ns to 45  ns in the temperature range of @xmath127  k and rapidly drops with the further temperature increase . at @xmath128  k , the signal at negative delays is not detectable .",
    "this means that the decay time @xmath122 is shorter than the pulse repetition period @xmath129 .",
    "the experimental results presented above clearly show that , at low temperature and low excitation power , the structure under study is characterized by extremely narrow widths of exciton resonances and demonstrate zero stokes shifts between the resonances observed in pl and reflectance spectra .",
    "this is a clear indication of the absence of noticeable inhomogeneous broadening of spectral lines .",
    "the line width is controlled solely by the relaxation processes .",
    "the absence of any noticeable broadening of the resonances with the temperature rise at quasiresonant excitation with low power ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) means that the relaxation of radiative excitons is not affected by the exciton - phonon scattering in the temperature range studied . at the same time",
    ", the peak width remarkably rises with excitation power ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) . because the pump power increase leads to the increase of the exciton density , the observed additional broadening , @xmath130 , is most probably related to exciton - exciton collisions resulting in the relaxation of exciton states .",
    "the rate of relaxation should be proportional to the exciton density and , therefore , to the excitation power .",
    "the experiment , however , shows a sublinear power dependence , see fig .",
    "we have to assume that the nonlinearity is caused by the collision - induced decrease of the radiative recombination rate and of the corresponding broadening , @xmath131 , due to the decrease of the exciton coherence volume .",
    "such effect of additional relaxation on the radiative recombination rate of excitons is theoretically discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite and experimentally studied in refs .",
    "@xcite the decrease of radiative broadening partially compensates the collision - induced broadening so that the total peak broadening , @xmath132 , should depend on power sublinearly  @xcite .",
    "the linear dependence of integral intensities of exciton peaks on the excitation power ( not shown here ) evidences that there is no noticeable contribution of other mechanisms , e.g. , of nonradiative exciton recombination , to the line broadening in these experimental conditions .",
    "the above - noted increase of relative intensity and width of the first exciton peak at high photon energy of excitation ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) requires a particular attention .",
    "these observations point out that the cascade relaxation of photocreated excitons over the quantum confined states is replaced by the direct carrier relaxation into the lowest exciton level . indeed , at the excitation above the @xmath72 transition , the probability of resonant excitation with generation of excitons becomes smaller than that of generation of free carriers .",
    "the photocreated electrons and holes relax to their ground states where they are bound in excitons .",
    "the excitons thus created populate predominantly the lowest energy state , that explains the increased intensity of the @xmath63 peak at these excitation conditions .",
    "our assumption about the photocreation of free carriers is further supported by the observation of a strong broadening of the lowest exciton peak . indeed , according to refs .",
    "@xcite , the cross - section of exciton - free - carrier scattering is by an order of magnitude larger than that of the exciton - exciton one .",
    "so , the exciton relaxation due to exciton - carrier collisions is mainly responsible for the strong broadening of the @xmath63 resonance in the case of excitation above the @xmath72 transition .",
    "the temperature dependence of the pl peak intensities and widths ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) appears to be contradictory at the first glance .",
    "the temperature increase induces a remarkable decrease of the integral pl that points out to the activation of efficient nonradiative relaxation processes for excitons .",
    "the relaxation would seem to be accompanied by a noticeable broadening of exciton peaks , which is not observed in the experiment .",
    "the origin of this effect is related to the temperature dependence of the exciton density in the reservoir .",

    "note that the la phonons stronger interact with excitons than other acoustic phonons  @xcite .",
    "the wave vector of a la phonon of energy about 0.5 mev in gaas is 0.07 nm@xmath6 , approximately .",
    "the light cone is limited by the photon wave vector , @xmath133 0.03 nm@xmath6 in gaas , that is smaller than the phonon wave vector .",
    "so , the most part of excitons created by a nonresonant optical excitation should be nonradiative ones .        at low temperature ,",
    "the main decay channel of nonradiative excitons in high - quality structure is the wave vector relaxation schematically shown in fig .",

    "nonradiative excitons do not directly interact with light .",
    "however , as we can see , they give some indirect contribution to reflectance .",

    "is not expected to play a major role at low excitation powers used in our experiments .",
