    "deterministic phase - insensitive quantum amplifiers , which amplify equally any quadrature of light , are fundamentally limited by quantum physics and must add a minimal amount of quantum noise @xcite . a noiseless linear amplifier ( nla ) , on the other hand , can in theory achieve a phase - insensitive amplification which does not add any noise , and more surprisingly which does not amplifies the quantum noise , but at the expense of a probabilistic transformation @xcite .",
    "noiseless linear amplification have been actively studied from various perspectives .",
    "the first one concerns the implementation of the nla itself , since a perfect noiseless amplification can only occur with a zero probability of success @xcite .",
    "however , one can obtain an output with a very high fidelity and non - zero probability if the output state if well approximated within a @xmath0 dimensional hilbert space . increasing this value , and",
    "hence the working range of the approximate nla , inevitably decreases the probability of success .",
    "several methods have been proposed and experimentally realized to implement an approximate nla @xcite .",
    "some implementations have also been proposed in order to increase the probability of success @xcite , or to avoid the use of non - gaussian resources @xcite when restricted to the amplification of coherent states .",
    "the nla has also been studied from a more abstract point of view @xcite , and with a focus on optimal design and probability of success @xcite .",
    "the second perspective has focused on the use of the nla for various applications , such as quantum information protocols or quantum state preparation @xcite , either considering a perfect nla as a theoretical limit , or an approximated one .",
    "the nla has for instance been shown to be useful in quantum key distribution , for continuous - variable @xcite as well as discrete - variable @xcite .",
    "it can also be used for loss suppression @xcite , bell - inequality violation @xcite , entanglement distillation @xcite , quantum cloning @xcite , phase - insensitive squeezing @xcite , or error correction @xcite .",
    "a promising result towards a practical use of the nla is the possibility to implement it virtually , using only post - selection @xcite , as experimentally demonstrated for entanglement distillation @xcite .",
    "+    most of the analyses mentioned above start by considering specific protocols , hence address a specific class of input states , such as coherent states .",
    "this is an effective approach , but clearly lacks generality , in particular when one is interested in using the nla with non - gaussian states . in this paper",
    "we present a generalization which allows to describe the nla acting after a gaussian channel as an effective channel .",
    "the usefulness of such a description is twofold .",
    "first , the noiseless amplification from the effective system is usually simpler to compute , especially if the input state is pure , as assumed in most protocols .",
    "second , it gives a physical insight in the transformation produced by the noiseless amplification , and allows to find new protocols and applications .",
    "the outline is as follows : in the first part , we show that a linear symmetric lossy and noisy gaussian quantum channel followed by a nla produces the same transformation as an effective nla of different gain , followed by an effective linear symmetric gaussian quantum channel , as shown in fig .",
    "[ ampli_deterministe_phaseindependant ] .",
    "the effective quantum channel is then studied is detail .",
    "we analyze some behaviors and physical constraints on the effective parameters , and show that the effective channel can be reduced to a simpler one in some cases .    in the second part",
    ", we use those results to present two new potential applications of the nla .",
    "we first generalize the results of @xcite , and show that an exact loss reduction is achievable using the effective system .",
    "the second application concerns the ` phase concentration ' and the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "we show that the addition of thermal noise can improve both of them , thanks to a non trivial behavior of the effective parameters .",
    "let us start by introducing the main ideas leading to the effective system , while leaving the detailed calculation in the appendix .",
    "we consider a perfect nla , described by an operator @xmath1 , which transforms a coherent state @xmath2 to @xmath3    we stress that our approach focuses on a linear state - independent regime , which is to be understood as a theoretical limit for any physical implementation of the nla . in practice",
    ", a given physical implementation will act as a nla only for a limited range of input states , which can however be made arbitrarily large , e.g. by increasing the number of stages in the quantum scissors scheme @xcite .",
    "the effective system is obtained by computing the output state with two methods , for an arbitrary input state .",
    "the first method corresponds to the quantum channel followed by the nla .",
    "the second methods corresponds to the effective system , where the input state is first noiselessly amplified , and then sent through an effective quantum channel . by comparing the two outputs",
    ", we can get the expressions of the parameters of the effective system such that the two transformations are equal .",
    "let @xmath4 be an arbitrary quantum state , which we express using the @xmath5 function @xcite : @xmath6 note that @xmath7 may in general be ill - behaved for non classical states , including squeezed and non - gaussian states , however , we will not need its explicit expression , but simply use the linearity of the transformations in the coherent states basis to obtain the expression of the effective system .",
    "several analytical and numerical tests have been performed to ensure the validity of this approach , by comparing the output states obtained with the direct system and with the effective system , for various gaussian and non - gaussian states .",
    "the action of the initial channel @xmath8 on the input state @xmath4 can be described by a linear quantum operation @xmath9 , which transforms a coherent state of mean amplitude @xmath10 to a thermal state of parameter @xmath11 and mean amplitude @xmath12 .",
    "as shown in the appendix [ appen1 ] , the action of a nla on such a displaced thermal state produces another displaced thermal state @xmath13 of parameter @xmath14 and mean amplitude @xmath15 , where the gain @xmath16 is given by @xmath17        we now consider the case depicted in fig .",
    "[ ampli_deterministe_phaseindependant ] ( b ) , where a nla of gain @xmath20 is directly applied to the input state @xmath4 . using again the decomposition , the action of this nla on a coherent state @xmath21 can be directly obtained from . in order to obtain the same exponential factor as in",
    ", @xmath20 needs to satisfy @xmath22    we seek for a more general channel @xmath23 after the effective nla , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ ampli_deterministe_phaseindependant ] ( b ) . in the most general case , a deterministic linear symmetric gaussian channel",
    "is composed of three elements : an addition of thermal noise @xmath24 at its input ; a deterministic phase - insensitive amplifier of intensity gain @xmath25 , limited to the quantum noise ; and a noiseless lossy channel of transmission @xmath26 . as discussed below , the effective channel can be reduced to an addition of input noise followed by loss or by a deterministic amplification , however we consider those two elements here to stay in a more general case .",
    "as shown in the appendix [ app_appen2 ] , an amplified coherent state @xmath27 is therefore also transformed to a displaced thermal state @xmath28 of parameter @xmath29 and mean amplitude @xmath30 , leading to the output state @xmath31      the resolution of this set of equations gives the following effective parameters : @xmath35 }   : = \\eta \\label{eff_eta } \\\\",

    "first , there is only a condition on the product @xmath36 , and not on @xmath37 and @xmath38 separately .",
    "the input noise @xmath24 also depends on @xmath38 , since when @xmath38 increases , for given values of @xmath39 and of the output noise , more noise is added by the deterministic amplification , and hence less input noise is needed .      there is a channel degeneracy : several combinations @xmath40 can be equivalent to the same initial channel @xmath8 followed by the real nla .",
    "indeed , a state of variance @xmath41 is transformed to an output state of variance for the shot noise . ]              * @xmath47 : one can set @xmath48 and @xmath49 . in that case",
    ", one recovers the effective parameters of @xcite , and the effective channel @xmath23 is composed of a lossy channel of transmission @xmath39 , with an input noise @xmath50 and @xmath51 . *",
    "@xmath52 : one can set @xmath53 , and the effective channel @xmath23 is simply composed of an input noise addition @xmath50 .",
    "* @xmath54 : one can set @xmath55 and @xmath56 . in that case , the effective channel @xmath23 is composed of a deterministic phase insensitive amplifier of gain @xmath56 , with an input noise @xmath24 and @xmath57 .",
    "we stress that the effective parameters are obtained by a general method without involving any normalization , hence they are independent of the input state .",
    "the equivalence shown is this paper is also still valid if the input state has several modes , with one sent through the channel .",
    "since the perfect nla is theoretically described by an unbounded operator , it can lead to non - physical amplified states .",
    "for the same reason , it can lead to non - physical effective parameters when the gain of the real nla is too large .",
    "thus , the following constraints must be satisfied : the effective gain must be real and non divergent ; each displaced thermal states given by must not diverge ; the global transmission @xmath39 must not diverge ; and the input noise @xmath24 must be positive .    remarkably , each of all those constraints leads to the same single condition on @xmath58 , given by @xmath59 as long as is satisfied , the effective parameters have a physical meaning .",
    "however , one has to be careful that this does not ensure that the amplified output state will be physical , as this depends on the input state .",
    "one can also define the maximum amount of noise for a given gain of the nla from @xmath60 : @xmath61      as shown in @xcite , @xmath39 is smaller than 1 as long as @xmath58 is smaller than a value @xmath63 which depends on @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "it is straightforward to see that @xmath63 is always smaller than @xmath60 , and therefore the physicality constraints are always fulfilled if the effective channel is restricted to a noisy and lossy channel .",
    "let us now highlight an important property of those effective parameters , coming from the fact that we consider the global transformation composed of the initial quantum channel and the nla . generally speaking , they increase with all parameters @xmath58 , @xmath64 , or @xmath65 . in particular , as soon as @xmath66 , @xmath63 will not be infinite and there will be a value of @xmath58 such that @xmath52 . on the contrary , for a fixed value of @xmath58 , the value of @xmath39 increases with @xmath65 . by adding thermal noise on purpose ,",
    "it is thus possible to convert the initial channel to a lossless channel with @xmath67 , for any gain @xmath58 of the nla greater than 1 .",
    "naturally , the smaller the gain @xmath58 , the greater the noise to add .",
    "this property will be analyzed in the next section .",
    "the effective channel @xmath23 following the effective nla is described by an operation @xmath127 .",
    "as explained in the main text , we look for parameters @xmath20 , @xmath24 , @xmath38 , and @xmath128 such that @xmath129{\\mbox{$\\hat{t}$}}=\\mu\\text { } \\mathfrak{l}_g[{\\mbox{$\\hat{t}$}}_{\\rm in}{\\mbox{$\\hat{\\rho}$}}_{\\rm in } { \\mbox{$\\hat{t}$}}_{\\rm in } ] , \\label{nla_effectif_egalite_reel}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath130 is the operator associated to the effective nla , and @xmath131 is a constant factor , independent of @xmath4 .              for both quadratures .",
    "it can thus be written as a displaced thermal state @xmath136 , where @xmath29 is such that @xmath137 , which gives @xmath138 after the effective quantum channel @xmath23 , finally becomes @xmath139= \\int \\mathrm{d}^2\\gamma \\text { } p_{\\rm in}(\\gamma){\\mbox{$\\hat{\\sigma}$}}_{\\rm",

    "the first condition is given by comparing the exponential factors : @xmath140 the second and third conditions are given by comparing the displaced thermal states @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and by imposing the same mean amplitude and variance : @xmath141    one can easily solve this system of equations , obtaining the effective parameters : @xmath142 }   : = \\eta\\\\ \\delta & = \\frac{2}{g}+\\frac { 2{-}\\epsilon}{2 } \\left[\\left(g^2{-}1\\right ) t \\epsilon { -}2\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the constant factor @xmath131 is given by @xmath143 which is independent of the input state @xmath4 .",
    "in this section , we present two applications of our results , for loss suppression and phase concentration .",
    "we note that we can also recover the results of @xcite , since when the input state is an epr state of parameter @xmath68 , the effective nla transforms it to another epr state of parameter @xmath69 .",
    "if the gain of the nla is smaller than @xmath63 , we can use the effective channel degeneracy and set @xmath48 .",
    "m. miuda _",
    "et al . _ have introduced the concept of noiseless attenuation , which allows to reduce the loss from a channel , when used with a nla of appropriate gain @xcite .",
    "this attenuator is a nla of gain @xmath70 , which can be implemented by sending the state to be attenuated through a beam - splitter of amplitude transmission @xmath71 , and conditioning on the vacuum for the reflected mode .",
    "the principle of their protocol is the following : the initial state is first noiselessly attenuated with a factor @xmath71 . it is then sent through the quantum channel , assumed noiseless in @xcite , which reduces its amplitude by @xmath72 .",
    "finally , the state is noiselessly amplified with a nla of gain @xmath73 . in the limit @xmath74 , the protocol tends to the identity operation , and the input state does not undergo any loss . on the contrary , for a non zero @xmath71 , the output state is also ` contaminated ' by noisy terms .",
    "apart from the fact that @xmath75 corresponds to an infinite value of @xmath58 , and hence a zero probability of success , this suppression of loss does not take a simple form for @xmath76 .",
    "the results of @xcite are also valid only for a noiseless channel . using the equivalent system presented in this paper ,",
    "the generalization of loss suppression is straightforward not only for a non zero @xmath71 , but also for a noisy channel .",
    "as shown below , by using the appropriate gain for the noiseless attenuation , it is possible to exactly reduce loss , even if this gain does not tend to zero .",
    "indeed , we have shown that a nla after a quantum channel @xmath8 is equivalent to an effective nla of gain @xmath20 before an effective channel @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , an attenuator of gain @xmath77 completely compensates the action of the effective nla , since @xmath78 there remains only the effective channel @xmath23 , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ loss_suppression ] .    for a noiseless channel ( @xmath62 ) ,",
    "the effective gain is given by @xmath79 , and the effective parameter @xmath39 , given by @xmath80 always satisfies @xmath81 for @xmath82 .",
    "one can thus _ exactly _ obtain a channel with smaller loss , using an attenuator of gain @xmath83 for a gain @xmath84 , becomes @xmath85 which corresponds to the gain used in @xcite .",
    "we see here that using a gain instead always leads to an exact channel with lower loss for any value of @xmath58 .    when the initial channel is noisy , the effective channel can always be transformed to lossless channel with @xmath52 . for a given value of @xmath58 ,",
    "this can be achieved by adding some noise between the attenuator and the channel , which allows to fully suppress loss , with a finite gain , but at the price of having more noise .",
    "the experimental implementation of a nla is very demanding on resources , especially on single - photon for most of the schemes .",
    "a protocol proposed by p. marek and r. filip @xcite allows a particularly simple setup , as experimentally demonstrated by the group of u. andersen @xcite .",
    "the principle is the following : the coherent state is randomly displaced around its mean value , which corresponds to thermal noise addition .",
    "a photon is then subtracted from the noisy state .",
    "although this scheme does not strictly produce an amplified coherent state , the photon subtraction will ` select ' high amplitudes @xmath86 with a weight @xmath87 , leading to a reduction of the phase variance , hence the appellation of phase concentration .",
    "following the same idea , but replacing the photon subtraction by a nla , high amplitudes coherent states will also be selected , but with an exponential factor @xmath88 $ ] . for a nla of given gain @xmath58",
    ", it thus appears that adding noise before the noiseless amplification can also lead to phase concentration .",
    "we use a simple criteria to define the phase uncertainty @xmath89 by @xmath90 as shown in fig .",
    "[ concentration_phase ] ( a ) .",
    "this quantity therefore corresponds to the inverse of the square root of the output snr , and can be easily calculated using the equivalent system , since the noise addition corresponds to a channel with @xmath91 .",
    "note that there is no loss in the effective channel @xmath23 in that case ( @xmath55 ) , since @xmath92 as soon as @xmath91 and @xmath93 . in that picture",
    ", the effective nla transforms the initial coherent state of mean amplitude @xmath94 to a coherent state of mean amplitude @xmath95 .",
    "the effective channel then degrades the snr by adding the equivalent input noise @xmath96 .",
    "the phase uncertainty is therefore also given by @xmath97    fig .",
    "[ concentration_phase ] ( b ) shows that @xmath89 can be theoretically reduced to an arbitrarily low value with the noise addition .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 goes to the maximal corresponding value @xmath98 . from this result",
    ", we can also conclude that the snr can be arbitrarily increased , for a nla of fixed gain , by adding thermal noise to the state .",
    "we have discussed a general equivalence when a nla is used after a noisy and lossy quantum channel , and shown that the transformation is equal to an effective nla followed by an effective channel , up to a state - independent proportionality factor .",
    "this equivalence is valid regardless of the nature or the input state , which may be non - gaussian , or part of a multimode state .    using this picture",
    ", we have analyzed several applications : when a suitable noiseless attenuation is used before the quantum channel , it is possible to obtain an exact effective quantum channel with smaller loss , but with larger noise if the initial noise is non zero . increasing the gain of the nla , or deliberately adding noise before the quantum channel ( and after the noiseless attenuation ) can lead to a perfectly noisy lossless quantum channel .",
    "we have also shown that this noise addition can be used to reduce the phase uncertainty of input coherent states .    as shown with those two applications , our results not only allow for a simpler calculation of the amplified states , but they also provide a detailed physical explanation , which is likely to be useful for future applications .",
