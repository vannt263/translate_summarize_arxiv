    "suppose @xmath5 then @xmath6 and so asymptotically we have @xmath7    the proof views the two branches of the inverse function of @xmath2 as an iterated function system and uses properties , given in @xcite , for finding the hausdorff dimension of the unique attractor for such a system , which is proved to be the julia set @xmath3 .    for @xmath4 small , julia sets of these quadratic polynomials are often referred to as _ quasi - circles _ ( see figure [ pic : quasi ] ) .",
    "an asymptotic formula similar to the above is known for small @xmath4 , due to bowen and ruelle , but the proof is much harder in this case as we are unable to use properties of contractions . because of this the result is often stated but rarely proved .",
