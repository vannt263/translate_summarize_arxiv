    "novel quantum phenomenon driven by the interplay of strong spin - orbit coupling and coulomb interaction has been a subject of significant study in the fields of condensed matter physics and materials science . since spin and orbital degrees of freedom",
    "are entangled at a local level by the spin - orbit coupling , the total angular momentum provides a good description of ordered phases and fluctuation properties . on the other hand",
    ", we would envisage possible realization of devices with exotic functionalities that utilize cross correlation involving magnetic and electric degrees of freedom , in which magnetic behavior can be manipulated by an applied electric field , while electric behavior can be controlled by a magnetic field .",
    "recently , a @xmath0 transition metal oxide sr@xmath1iro@xmath2 , in which ir@xmath7 ions have five electrons with a low - spin @xmath8 state , has attracted growing attention as a candidate for a novel mott insulator characterized by an effective total angular momentum @xmath9=@xmath10 , where @xmath11=@xmath12@xmath13+@xmath14 , rather than spin commonly observed in @xmath15 mott insulators @xcite .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling in the @xmath3 manifold stabilizes the @xmath9=@xmath10 state . the emergent behavior of the @xmath9=@xmath10 mott insulator has been explored in experiments such as angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy @xcite , optical conductivity @xcite , resonant x - ray scattering @xcite , and resonant inelastic x - ray scattering @xcite .",
    "an isostructural iridate ba@xmath1iro@xmath2 has also been reported as the @xmath9=@xmath10 mott insulator @xcite .",
    "theoretical efforts have been devoted to clarify the characteristics of the @xmath9=@xmath10 mott insulator on the basis of first - principles calculations @xcite and model calculations @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to gain an insight into the spin - orbital state under the spin - orbit coupling from a microscopic viewpoint .",
    "we investigate ground - state properties of a @xmath3-orbital hubbard model including the spin - orbit coupling by exploiting numerical techniques .",
    "we discuss a spin - orbit - induced ground - state transition from a spin singlet state to a singlet state in terms of the effective total angular momentum .",
    "we consider triply degenerate @xmath3 orbitals on a square lattice in the @xmath4 plane , and the electron number per site is five , corresponding to the low - spin state of ir@xmath7 ions .",
    "the @xmath3-orbital hubbard model is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is an annihilation operator for an electron with spin @xmath18 ( = @xmath19 ) in orbital @xmath20 ( = @xmath21 ) at site @xmath22 , @xmath23=@xmath24 , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 represent spin and orbital angular momentum operators , respectively .",
    "the hopping amplitude is given by @xmath27=@xmath28=@xmath29=@xmath30=@xmath31 , and zero for other combinations of orbitals .",
    "hereafter , @xmath31 is taken as the energy unit .",
    "@xmath32 denotes the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "@xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath35 are intra - orbital coulomb , inter - orbital coulomb , exchange ( hund s rule coupling ) , and pair - hopping interactions , respectively .",
    "we assume that @xmath33=@xmath34+@xmath35+@xmath36 due to the rotational symmetry in the local orbital space , and @xmath35=@xmath36 due to the reality of the @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 orbital functions .    we numerically investigate ground - state properties of the @xmath37@xmath38@xmath37 four - site system by lanczos diagonalization .",
    "because of the three orbitals , the number of bases per site is @xmath39=@xmath40 , and the matrix dimension of the hamiltonian becomes huge as the system size increases . in general , the matrix dimension is reduced by decomposing the hilbert space into a block - diagonal form by using symmetries of the hamiltonian . in the present case ,",
    "the total number of electrons is a good quantum number .",
    "we can not use the @xmath41 component of the total spin as a good quantum number , since the spin su(2 ) symmetry is broken by the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "we have not utilized the lattice symmetry such as the translational symmetry .",
    "thus the matrix dimension is @xmath42 for four sites , while it grows to @xmath43 for eight sites .",
    "orbitals under the spin - orbit coupling . to visualize the wavefunction , we draw the surface defined by @xmath44=@xmath45 in the polar coordinate with @xmath18 being real spin , while the color denotes the weight of spin up and down states .",
    ", scaledwidth=90.0% ]    first we briefly discuss the local electron configuration in the atomic limit .",
    "as shown in fig .  1 ,",
    "the @xmath3 level is split by the spin - orbit coupling into a @xmath46=@xmath10 doublet and a @xmath46=@xmath47 quartet , in which the eigenstates are characterized by the effective total angular momentum @xmath46 .",
    "the eigenstates are @xmath48=@xmath49@xmath50@xmath51 with eigenenergy @xmath32 for the @xmath46=@xmath10 doublet , and @xmath52=@xmath53 and @xmath54=@xmath55@xmath12@xmath56 with eigenenergy @xmath12@xmath57 for the @xmath46=@xmath47 quartet , where we introduce @xmath58 and @xmath59 orbitals to distinguish two kramers doublets in the @xmath46=@xmath47 quartet , and pseudospins to label two states in each kramers doublet .",
    "note that due to the entanglement of spin and orbital states , the wavefunction exhibits anisotropic charge and spin distributions .",
    "since we have five electrons for an ir@xmath7 ion , the lower @xmath46=@xmath47 quartet is fully occupied , while the upper @xmath46=@xmath10 doublet is half - filled .",

    "( b ) total and effective total angular momenta . , scaledwidth=75.0% ]    now we move on to the lanczos results . in fig .",
    "2(a ) , we present the magnitude of sum total of spin and orbital angular momenta in the whole system , defined by @xmath61=@xmath62 and @xmath63=@xmath64 , respectively . at @xmath32=@xmath65 , @xmath66",
    "is found to be zero , indicating a spin singlet ground state . as @xmath32 increases",
    ", @xmath66 gradually increases and a sudden change occurs at a transition point , above which the ground state turns to a weak ferromagnetic state .",
    "note that the induced spin moment is reduced from the maximum value @xmath10@xmath38@xmath67=@xmath37 .",
    "we also find an abrupt change for @xmath68 , implying that the orbital configuration is reorganized .",
    "figure  2(b ) represents the magnitude of sum total of total and effective total angular momenta in the whole system , defined by @xmath69=@xmath70 and @xmath71=@xmath72 , respectively .",
    "@xmath73 is enhanced in the weak ferromagnetic state .",
    "in contrast , @xmath74 decreases and approaches zero in the limit of large @xmath32 .",
    "thus the weak ferromagnetic state is regarded as a singlet state in terms of the effective total angular momentum .    to clarify how the orbital state changes as @xmath32 varies , we measure the charge density in each of the @xmath3 orbitals , @xmath75=@xmath76 , in different two basis sets .",
    "note that due to the translational invariance , the charge density is equivalent in all sites . in fig .",
    "3(a ) , we plot the charge density in the real @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 orbitals . at @xmath32=@xmath65 ,",
    "we find that @xmath77=1.5 and @xmath78=@xmath79=1.75 , since the itinerancy of orbitals depends on the hopping direction and holes preferably occupy the @xmath4 orbitals rather than the @xmath5 and @xmath6 orbitals . as @xmath32 increases , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and",

    "3(b ) , we observe a sharp change at the transition point , implying again the reorganization of the orbital configuration .",
    "for large @xmath32 , the @xmath81 orbitals are singly occupied and relevant to the low - energy property , while the @xmath58 and @xmath59 orbitals are fully occupied , consistent with the local electron configuration in the atomic limit , as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "this clearly indicates the emergence of a complex orbital state , in which spin and orbital states are entangled with complex number coefficients .",
