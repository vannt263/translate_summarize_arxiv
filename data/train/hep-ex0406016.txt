    "has observed two new narrow states in the @xmath0  @xcite and @xmath1  @xcite invariant mass spectra , from inclusive @xmath19 interactions , denoted as @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively .",
    "both states have been observed by cleo  @xcite and belle  @xcite experiments as well .",

    "the observation for the @xmath27 is provided by the peak in the distribution of the quantity @xmath28 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2317 - 2458]c : the peak is missing when considering @xmath29 sidebands ; the residual background would correspond to @xmath30 mesons associated to random photons selected to be consistent with the @xmath31 decay . to disentangle these two possible decays and evaluate a possible @xmath30 feed - up effect , an uml fit using the channel likelihood method",
    "is applied ; this fit is simultaneously performed to the @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 mass spectra of all @xmath32 combinations .",
    "fit results are shown in the three plots at left - side of fig .",

    "@xmath18 has been investigated ; it would be produced as follows : @xmath36 and @xmath37 where the @xmath38 combination could emulate a @xmath20 candidate and the residual photon would appear to be unrelated or simply lost .",
    "[ fig : maxlik]d shows the fitted @xmath33 mass spectrum in data with the peaking background contribution , estimated from monte carlo simulation , associated to @xmath18 decays .    from previous fits , masses ( given in tab.[tab : dsj ] ) , widths and yields are extracted ; from these yield , once corrected by recostruction efficiency , the relative production rate in continuum is calculated ( tab.[tab : dsj ] ) .",
    "the observed widths ( @xmath39 10  me-0.1emv ) are consistent with the experimental resolution as determined by simulation studies ; thus the intrinsic width must be below the observed one .",
    "this analysis is described in detail elsewhere  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "further experimental information on the decay modes of @xmath30 and @xmath18 ( including those produced in @xmath22 decays ) allows one to infer their most likely spin - parity assignment  @xcite : @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively .",
    "therefore they could be identified with the missing @xmath42 doublet of p - wave @xmath43 states .",
    "their masses are significantly lower than predicted by established potential models ( below @xmath44 and @xmath45 thresholds respectively ) and enough to close off the most natural decay modes .",
    "if they are interpreted as ordinary @xmath46 states , this forces them to decay mainly via isospin - violating transition making their widths quite narrow ; a possible mechanism is the decay through a virtual @xmath47 followed by @xmath48 mixing .",
    "the unexpected masses and widths have led to a great effort on theoretical side as well  @xcite : either these models need modification or the observed state might have a non-@xmath49 nature . among the `` exotic '' explanations , a @xmath44 molecule , a four - quark state and a @xmath50 atom have been proposed ; among `` ordinary '' explanations there have been attempts to revise or modify potential models and to couple chiral perturbation theory with hqet ; it has been even proposed that these states are a mixture of @xmath43 and four - quark states .",
    "further experimental information on the radiative decays and di - pion emission of the new mesons can definitely shed light on their nature .",
