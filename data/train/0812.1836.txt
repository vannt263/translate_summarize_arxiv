    "there are currently a large number of observations of ferromagnetism associated with doping of _ a priori _ non - magnetic species into non - magnetic oxide semi - conductors @xcite .",
    "the subject has been given the name of d@xmath0 magnetism to emphasize the fact that the magnetism is probably not coming from partially filled d - orbitals , but from moments induced in the p - orbitals of the oxygen band @xcite . even in cases",
    "where there are partially filled d - orbitals , discrepancies between bulk measurements indicating ferromagnetism , and microscopic measurements by xmcd finding paramagnetic transition metal ions , have suggested that the ferromagnetism comes from vacancies in the oxygen lattices @xcite . while a fertile area of current investigation , the subject remains obscure because of problems of irreproducibility for different samples , sample inhomogeneity , stability in time , _ etc .",
    "_ , and the exact origin of the magnetism is not yet established .",
    "this is unlike the case of regular diluted magnetic semi - conductors such as ( ga , mn)as @xcite , where ferromagnetism is reproducible in controlled samples .",
    "the theoretical situation is also much less clear for d@xmath0 magnetism than in the case of `` classic '' diluted magnetic semiconductors where the origin of the magnetic moments , the substituted magnetic ion , is in no doubt and , in the case of mn@xmath3 , quite large ( s=5/2 ) .",
    "magnetic exchange interactions leading to ferromagnetism are mediated by holes in the p band . for ( ga , mn)as",
    ", curie temperatures can be estimated with reasonable accuracy , starting from band structure to first derive the effective exchange at different distances between spins in an effective spin hamiltonian @xcite which is then studied via classical monte carlo or other approximate methods @xcite .",
    "although this approach is adequate for bulk properties such as the ordering temperature for a variety of materials , fuller treatment of the effects of the correlation are needed for understanding more detailed properties such as the local densities of states and impurity band structure @xcite . even for thermodynamic properties such as the curie temperature ,",
    "there is good reason to doubt straightforward application of methods apparently working for `` classic '' diluted magnetic semiconductors to the materials that may show d@xmath0 magnetism . in this case , the induced moments postulated in the oxygen bands are not fully localized , but are formed by the same holes that generate effective exchange .",
    "it was recently argued , for example , that @xcite because of this , exchanges estimated from local approximations , such as the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) may consistently over - estimate the tendency for ferromagnetism and even formation of local moments , compared to extensions , such as self - interaction correction ( sic ) .",
    "thus much of the theoretical literature may be over - optimistic in predictions of ferromagnetism , even at zero temperature .",
    "one can even question whether the approach is valid to first project the full hamiltonian onto the zero - temperature spin hamiltonian , to which the effects of thermal fluctuations are added .",
    "it is important , therefore , to develop methods which treat correlations correctly and that do not rely on arbitrary approximations or on the separation between spin and charge fluctuations .",
    "such a method has been introduced and applied to models of the `` classic '' diluted magnetic semiconductors @xcite , namely quantum monte carlo methods based on the hirsch - fye algorithm .",
    "these can directly give spin correlations at finite temperatures without making any assumption of projection onto an effective hamiltonian .",
    "in this paper we apply the method to an interesting case of possible d@xmath0 magnetism , namely mgo diluted with nitrogen .",
    "our aim is then to answer , by means of quantum monte carlo methods the following questions .",
    "firstly , does such an unbiased calculation predict ferromagnetic correlations in such a material ? secondly , of more general interest",
    ", do the standard approaches , as described above , still apply ?",
    "in fact ferromagnetism has previously been predicted at low concentrations @xcite in the doped alkaline - earth metal oxides ( mgo , cao , bao , sro ) doped with n and c. our results are not completely comparable to those results , in that we shall consider a simpler model hamiltonian for the host and two impurities only , rather than a finite concentration",
    ". we should be able to draw useful general conclusions both for the particular material and the methods .",
    "in order to describe n impurities in mgo host , we take the two - step calculations .",
    "firstly , the haldane - anderson impurity model @xcite is formulated within the tight - binding approximation for determining the host band structure and the impurity - host hybridization .",
    "secondly , the magnetic correlations of the haldane - anderson impurity model at finite temperatures are calculated by the hirsch - fye quantum monte carlo technique @xcite .",

    "@xmath22(o)= -2.03 ev , where the value of @xmath22(o ) is taken from the tight - binding parameters for the compound mgo ( see below ) .    for the compound mg(o , n )",

    "we discuss the tight - binding calculation for the mgo band - structure , and the hybridization between an n impurity and mgo host .",
    "for mgo with rocksalt structure , the band structure @xmath19 had already been calculated with a set of tight - binding parameters @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the basis consists of a @xmath27 orbital for the cation mg@xmath3 and three degenerate @xmath23 orbitals for the anion o@xmath26 .",
    "the orbital energies are @xmath28(mg ) = 9.88 ev , @xmath22(o)= -2.03 ev . in addition , the mixing values between the @xmath29 orbital of mg@xmath3 and the @xmath30 orbitals of o@xmath26 up to the 3rd - nearest neighbors are taken to be @xmath31 = 1.10 ev , @xmath32 = -0.18 ev , @xmath33 = 0.65 ev , @xmath34 = -0.07 ev , and @xmath35 = 0.89 ev , where @xmath36 means the mixing of the @xmath37-th nearest neighbors .",
    "using these tight - binding parameters , we have reproduced the band structure of rocksalt mgo as shown in fig .",
    "[ f - eig ] , where band structure consists of one conduction band and three valence bands .",
    "the conduction band mainly comes from @xmath27 orbital of mg , and valence bands mainly come from @xmath23 orbitals of o. the top of valence bands and the bottom of conduction band are located at the @xmath38 point with a direct gap of 7.72 ev .",
    "next , we discuss the calculation of the hybridization between n impurity and mgo host within the tight - binding approximation .",
    "the hybridization matrix element @xmath39 has the form of @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the impurity @xmath23-state ( @xmath42 ) at site @xmath13 , and @xmath43 is the host state with wavevector @xmath7 and band index @xmath44 , which is expanded by atomic orbitals @xmath45 with orbital index @xmath46 and site index @xmath47 . here , @xmath48 is the total number of host lattice sites , and @xmath49 is an expansion coefficient . for the mixing integrals of @xmath50 , @xmath14 denotes the three @xmath23 orbitals of n@xmath26 , and @xmath46 represents the @xmath27 orbital of mg@xmath3 and @xmath23 orbitals of o@xmath26 . as shown by slater and koster @xcite ,",
    "these mixing integrals up to the 3rd - nearest neighbors can be expressed by four integrals @xmath31 @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and direction cosines @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath37 in the two - center approximation , where @xmath36 means the mixing of the @xmath37-th nearest neighbors . as the experimental values of the above four integrals are unknown , here we take these mixing integrals between n and mgo as the same mixing values between o and mgo in ref.@xcite .",
    "thus , we have @xmath31 = 1.10 ev , @xmath33 = 0.65 ev , @xmath34 = -0.07 ev , and @xmath35 = 0.89 ev for the impurity - host hybridization .",

    "<S> we study the possibility of d@xmath0 ferromagnetism in the compound mgo doped with nitrogen ( n ) . </S>",
    "<S> the haldane - anderson impurity model is formulated within the tight - binding approximation for determining the host band - structure and the impurity - host hybridization . using the quantum monte carlo technique , we observe a finite local moment for an n impurity , and long - range ferromagnetic correlations between two n impurities . </S>",
    "<S> the ferromagnetic correlations are strongly influenced by the impurity bound state . </S>",
    "<S> when the ferromagnetic correlation between a pair of impurities is mapped onto the isotropic heisenberg model for two spin-@xmath1 particles , the effective exchange constant @xmath2 is found to increase with increasing temperature . </S>",
    "<S> similar temperature dependence of @xmath2 is also obtained in other diluted magnetic semiconductors , such as zincblende zno doped with mn . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of @xmath2 suggests that the mapping of the full hamiltonian onto the spin hamiltonian can not fully describe the magnetic correlations for the diluted magnetic semiconductors at least in the limit of low impurity spin . </S>"
