    "an attempt to build a unified and overarching formulation of continuum mechanics in first order hyperbolic form that includes fluid mechanics as well as solid mechanics has been very recently described by peshkov and romenski in  @xcite .",
    "the proposed model , hereafter the hyperbolic peshkov - romenski ( hpr ) model , can potentially cover the entire spectrum of viscous flows ranging from non - equilibrium gas dynamics to newtonian and non - newtonian fluids , and even elastic and plastic deformation in solids , provided that the continuum description is applicable . in order to make this possible , the _ _ material element _ _ view point is employed and the very essence of any macroscopic flow , _",
    "i.e. _ the process of material element rearrangements , is explicitly described in the mathematical model .",
    "we note that the term _ material element _ should be understood in the conventional meaning of continuum mechanics , _",
    "i.e. _ as an _ ensemble _ of a _ sufficiently large number _ of molecules or atoms .",
    "an important difference between the hpr model and the classical continuum models is that the material elements not only have a finite size , but they also have an internal structure , which is subject to rearrangements , and which can be macroscopically described after introducing suitable quantities .",
    "thus , in order to describe the deformability of material elements , a tensorial field is not a tensor field of rank 2 , since it it transforms like a tensor of rank 1 with respect to a change of coordinates . ]",
    "@xmath1 $ ] is used .",
    "it maps the material elements from a current deformed state to the undeformed state , and it contains the information about deformation and rotation of material elements . while this approach is standard in the framework of solid mechanics , it is much less obvious for gas dynamics . because of the rearrangements of material elements , the field @xmath2 is not integrable in the sense that it does not relate eulerian and lagrangian coordinates of the continuum . as a result ,",
    "the field @xmath2 is _ local _ , see  @xcite .",
    "this is also the reason why we _ can not _ call @xmath2 the _ deformation gradient _ , and thus , following @xcite , we shall instead refer to it as the _ material distortion field _ , or simply the _ distortion tensor_.    in addition to the distortion field @xmath2 , another important information is required to describe rearrangements in a system of material elements of finite size .",
    "this information should characterize how easy or how hard it is for material elements to rearrange ( fluidity ) . in the kinetic theory of liquids ,",
    "frenkel  @xcite proposed to use the average time @xmath3 between two solid - like vibration states of an atom to describe the ability of a liquid to flow .. following this idea of frenkel , it was proposed in  @xcite to use a continuum analog @xmath4 of frenkel s time @xmath3 .",
    "thus , in our continuum approach , the time @xmath4 is the time taken by a given material element to `` escape '' from the _ cage _ composed of its neighbor elements , i.e. the time taken to _ rearrange _ with one of its neighbors . the more viscous a fluid is , the larger the time @xmath5 , _",
    "i.e. _ the longer the fluid elements stay in contact with each other .",
    "the limiting cases , inviscid fluids and elastic solids , are recovered when @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , while for viscous fluids , the time @xmath8 is finite with @xmath9 ( see the discussion in  @xcite ) .",
    "we shall call @xmath4 the _ strain dissipation time _",
    ", because , in the mathematical formulation of the hpr model the inverse time @xmath10 defines the rate at which shear strains dissipate during the rearrangement process .",
    "our material element point of view allows to formulate the system of governing partial differential equations ( pde ) with rather convenient mathematical properties :    * first , the model is described by a system of first order pdes .",
    "we recall that first order systems are less sensitive to the quality of the computational mesh and in general they allow to get a numerical scheme of higher order of accuracy than for a second order model on the same discrete stencil . *",
    "second , the model is _ hyperbolic _ if the total energy potential is a _ convex",
    "_ function of the state variables , see  @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the model is based on a _ wave _ formulation .",
    "indeed , from the point of view of the physics of wave propagation and because of the causality principle , any macroscopic transport phenomenon should be considered as a wave propagation process . in particular , the momentum transfer in a viscous fluid in the transverse direction to the mean flow is nothing but a wave propagation process .",
    "these waves are known as the shear waves , which are very dissipative waves propagating over a distance that equals just a few wave lengths .",
    "nevertheless , such waves give rise to very important phenomena known as boundary layers .",
    "thus , one may expect that a physically based boundary layer theory has to be based on such a transverse wave dynamics . in full agreement with the above discussion",
    ", there are two types of waves in our hyperbolic model , _ longitudinal waves _ and _ shear waves _ , which transfer momentum in the transverse flow directions .",
    "* third , the dissipative process of material element rearrangements is modeled by a stiff algebraic source term , _",
    "i.e. _ this term does not depend on the space derivatives , which automatically implies that the characteristic speeds of the corresponding hyperbolic system are always _ finite _ ( as they should ) , whatever the time @xmath4 is .",
    "one may recall that in hyperbolic maxwell - cattaneo - type models some characteristic speeds tend to infinity if the relaxation parameter tends to zero .",
    "we also note that the system of the governing equations discussed in  @xcite has already been derived by godunov & romenski in the 1970ies  @xcite in the context of elasto - plastic deformation of metals , for which it has been used by several authors over the years  @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "the idea that the same model could also describe the dynamics of any continuum , including inviscid fluids , viscous newtonian and non - newtonian fluids , elastic and visco - plastic solids was discussed in  @xcite for the first time . in order to allow a quantitative comparison also with the fourier heat conduction theory , in this paper we extend the model proposed by peshkov and romenski in @xcite by including also hyperbolic heat conduction equations , as proposed by romenski in  @xcite .",
    "the essential difference of our hyperbolic heat conduction model from that proposed by cattaneo  @xcite is that the speed of the heat propagation front is always _ finite _ , whatever the heat flux relaxation parameter is .",
    "we emphasize that it is not our aim to provide a link with kinetic theory , although this could be very illuminating , but rather to verify the capabilities of the hpr model to account for a wide variety of dynamical systems .",
    "the resulting governing partial differential equations of the hpr model , introduced in @xcite and presented later in section [ sec : model ] , are rather challenging from a numerical point of view , since they constitute a _ large system _ of nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws that also includes _ non - conservative products _ and _ stiff source terms_. to the best knowledge of the authors , the complete first order hpr model presented in @xcite has never been solved so far by any numerical method in multiple space dimensions and including all terms , hence one of the main goals of this paper is to thoroughly investigate the behavior of the hpr model in a large number of different standard benchmark problems of computational fluid mechanics and computational solid mechanics .",
    "it is important to mention that exactly for such a general class of nonlinear time - dependent hyperbolic pdes , the families of ader finite volume ( fv ) and ader discontinuous galerkin ( dg ) finite element methods have been developed in the past decade .",
    "the starting point of the original ader ( arbitrary high order derivatives ) schemes of toro & titarev et al . for hyperbolic conservation laws",
    "@xcite was the approximate solution of the generalized riemann problem ( grp ) @xcite that arises naturally in the context of high order finite volume and dg schemes , due to their piecewise high order polynomial data representation , for which the vector of conserved variables and all its spatial derivatives are known at a given time level .",
    "the ader approach has been successfully extended also to hyperbolic pdes with stiff source terms @xcite , to hyperbolic pdes with non - conservative products @xcite and to parabolic problems @xcite .",
    "recent developments include space - time adaptive meshes @xcite , moving meshes @xcite , ader - weno finite volume schemes for divergence - free magnetohydrodynamics",
    "@xcite and _ a posteriori _ limiting of high order ader - dg and ader - fv schemes @xcite . in the context of ader schemes ,",
    "first order hyperbolic reformulations of parabolic viscous problems have been tackled by toro and montecinos in @xcite , while a series of interesting previous work on first order hyperbolic reformulations of advection - diffusion equations was proposed by nishikawa in @xcite .",
    "although not directly related to viscous problems , we also would like to refer to the well - known relaxation system of jin and xin @xcite , which allows to reformulate any nonlinear hyperbolic conservation law as an augmented linear first order system with stiff relaxation source terms .    in this paper",
    ", we concentrate our attention on compressible viscous newtonian fluids , which in the classical continuum theory can be described by the hyperbolic - parabolic navier - stokes - fourier ( nsf ) theory , as well as on elastic solids .",
    "it should also be noted that there are several advantages of a first order hyperbolic formulation of viscous fluids : first , the use of explicit godunov - type shock - capturing finite volume schemes and , even more , the use of high order discontinuous galerkin finite element methods is - at least in principle - _ straightforward _ for first order systems , while dg schemes need some special care in the presence of parabolic and higher order derivative terms , see the very interesting discussions in the well - known papers of bassi & rebay @xcite , baumann & oden @xcite , cockburn and shu @xcite , yan and shu @xcite and others @xcite .",
    "second , the use of a parabolic theory can lead to a severe time step size restriction , if explicit time stepping schemes are used , since the infinite propagation speed of perturbations that is intrinsically inherent in parabolic pdes is reflected in explicit numerical methods by a stability condition on the time step that scales with the square of the mesh size , while it scales only linearly with the mesh size for first order hyperbolic systems due to the classical cfl condition @xcite .",
    "the situation is even worse for high order discontinuous galerkin finite element schemes , where the explicit time step size scales not only quadratically with the mesh size , but where it decreases even quadratically with the order of the method . in section [ sec : results ] we will show one numerical example with an explicit time stepping scheme , where the use of the first order hpr model is clearly more convenient in terms of time step size and cpu time compared to the classical parabolic navier - stokes theory . as a third and last advantage of a first order hyperbolic model , we would like to emphasize that , by avoiding the presence of _ infinite wave speeds _ even in the newtonian framework , the new formulation suggests that its extension to _",
    "relativistic continuum mechanics _ should also be possible .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : model ] we recall and discuss the extended hyperbolic peshkov - romenski model , denoted by hpr model in the following , including also a hyperbolic formulation of heat conduction . in particular , we show that the system is thermodynamically consistent and symmetric hyperbolic .",
    "a sketch of the analysis of the characteristics of the model is provided , together with a dispersion analysis of the wave speeds for relaxation times ranging from zero to infinity .",
    "we also carry out a formal asymptotic analysis of the system in the stiff relaxation limit , which reveals the direct connection of the first order hpr model with the well - established hyperbolic - parabolic navier - stokes - fourier equations of viscous heat conducting fluids . in section [ sec : ader ] we briefly summarize the numerical methods used to solve the hpr model in this paper , namely ader - weno finite volume schemes and ader discontinuous galerkin finite element methods , making use of the unified @xmath11 framework established in @xcite , which contains fv schemes and dg methods as two special cases of a more general class of numerical methods . in section [ sec : results ] we present computational results for a large set of different multi - dimensional test problems from computational fluid mechanics and also one example from computational solid mechanics , ranging from viscous low mach number flows over viscous and inviscid compressible flows to the simulation of wave propagation in elastic solids",
    ". the paper is rounded - off by some concluding remarks and an outlook to future research in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the unified first order hyperbolic model for continuum mechanics proposed by peshkov & romenski in @xcite , including a hyperbolic formulation of heat conduction , reads :    [ eqn.hpr ] @xmath12      & \\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial \\rho v_i}{\\partial t}+\\frac{\\partial \\left(\\rho v_i v_k + p \\delta_{ik } - \\sigma_{ik } \\right)}{\\partial x_k}=0 , \\label{eqn.momentum}\\\\[2 mm ]      & \\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial a_{i k}}{\\partial t}+\\frac{\\partial a_{im } v_m}{\\partial x_k}+v_j\\left(\\frac{\\partial a_{ik}}{\\partial x_j}-\\frac{\\partial a_{ij}}{\\partial x_k}\\right )      = -\\dfrac { \\psi_{ik } } { \\theta_1(\\tau_1)},\\label{eqn.deformation}\\\\[2 mm ]      & \\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial \\rho j_i}{\\partial t}+\\frac{\\partial \\left(\\rho j_i v_k+ t \\delta_{ik}\\right)}{\\partial x_k}=-\\dfrac{\\rho h_i}{\\theta_2(\\tau_2 ) } , \\label{eqn.heatflux}\\\\[2 mm ]      & \\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial \\rho s}{\\partial t}+\\frac{\\partial \\left(\\rho s v_k + h_k \\right)}{\\partial x_k}=\\dfrac{\\rho}{\\theta_1(\\tau_1 ) t } \\psi_{ik } \\psi_{ik } + \\dfrac{\\rho}{\\theta_2(\\tau_2 ) t } h_i h_i \\geq0 , \\label{eqn.entropy }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the solutions of the above pde system fulfill also the additional conservation law @xmath13 which is the conservation of total energy .",
    "actually , in the numerical computations shown later in section [ sec : results ] of this paper , we solve the energy equation instead of the entropy equation  , but from the point of view of the model formulation , the entropy should be considered among the vector of unknowns ( see section  [ sec.therm.hyperb ] for a discussion ) .    here",
    "we use the following notation : @xmath14 is the mass density , @xmath15={{\\mathbf{v}}}=(u , v , w ) $ ] is the velocity vector , @xmath16={{\\boldsymbol{a}}}$ ] is the distortion tensor , @xmath17={{\\mathbf{j}}}$ ] is the thermal impulse vector , @xmath18 is the entropy , @xmath19 is the total energy , @xmath20 is the pressure , @xmath21 is the kronecker delta , @xmath22=\\boldsymbol{\\sigma } = - [ \\rho a_{mi}e_{a_{mk } } ] $ ] is the symmetric viscous shear stress tensor , @xmath23 is the temperature , @xmath24 = \\mathbf{q } = [ e_s e_{j_k}]$ ] is the heat flux vector and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are positive scalar functions , which will be specified below , depending on the strain dissipation time @xmath27 and the thermal impulse relaxation time @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "the dissipative terms @xmath29 and @xmath30 on the right hand side of the evolution equations for @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are defined as @xmath34 = \\boldsymbol{\\psi } = [ e_{a_{ik}}]$ ] and @xmath35 = \\mathbf{h } = [ e_{j_i}]$ ] , respectively .",
    "hence , the viscous stress tensor and the heat flux vector are directly related to the dissipative terms on the right hand side via @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "note that @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 should be understood as the partial derivatives @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 ; they are the so - called _ energy gradients in the state space _ or the _ thermodynamic forces_. the einstein summation convention over repeated indices is implied .",
    "these equations are the mass conservation ( [ eqn.conti ] ) , the momentum conservation  ( [ eqn.momentum ] ) , the time evolution for the distortion  ( [ eqn.deformation ] ) , the time evolution for the thermal impulse  ( [ eqn.heatflux ] ) , the entropy time evolution  ( [ eqn.entropy ] ) , and the total energy conservation  ( [ eqn.energy ] ) . the pde governing the time evolution of the thermal impulse   looks formally very similar to the momentum equation , where the temperature @xmath46 takes the role of the pressure @xmath47 . due to this similarity",
    ", it will also be called the _ thermal momentum equation _ in the following .",
    "one can clearly see that in order to close the system , it is necessary to specify the total energy potential @xmath48 .",
    "this potential then generates all the constitutive fluxes ( _ i.e. _ non advective fluxes ) and source terms by means of its partial derivatives with respect to the state variables .",
    "hence , the energy specification is one of the key steps in the model formulation .    in order to specify @xmath49",
    ", we note that there are three scales involved in the continuum model formulation described in the introduction .",
    "namely , the molecular scale , or the _ microscale _ ; the scale of the material elements , called here _ mesoscale _ ; and the flow scale , or the _ macroscale_. it is therefore assumed that the total energy @xmath49 is the sum of three terms , each of which represents the energy distributed in its corresponding scale .",
    "thus , we assume that @xmath50 the terms @xmath51 and @xmath52 are conventional .",
    "they are the specific kinetic energy per unit mass @xmath53 , which represents the macroscale part of the total energy , and the _ internal energy _",
    "@xmath54 , which is related to the kinetic energy of the molecular motion .",
    "@xmath54 is the only energy which does not disappear in the thermodynamic equilibrium where any meso- and macroscopic dynamics are absent , and only molecular dynamics is present .",
    "for this reason , it is sometimes referred to as the _ equilibrium energy_. in this paper , for @xmath52 , we shall use either the _ ideal gas equation of state _",
    "@xmath55 or the _ stiffened gas equation of state _",

    "] , as discussed later in section  [ sec.charcteristics ] .",
    "we stress that @xmath73 is a simple _ quadratic form _ in terms of @xmath74 and @xmath32 .",
    "we also note that , because of the frame invariance principle , or _",
    "objectivity principle _ , the total energy can depend on vectors and tensors by means of their invariants only . by a direct calculation , one can see that @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 , and therefore @xmath78 , as well as the total energy @xmath49 , are a function of invariants of @xmath2 and @xmath79 .    in general , the mesoscopic energy @xmath73 can also be a function of @xmath80 and @xmath18 in addition to @xmath2 and @xmath79 .",
    "this would correspond to a coupling between the molecular scale and the scale of material elements .",
    "such a dependence on @xmath80 and @xmath18 should be introduced in the velocities @xmath69 and @xmath81 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",
    "the dependencies @xmath84 and @xmath85 should be taken into account when strongly non - equilibrium flows are considered .",
    "this would affect the computation of the pressure and of the temperature through the partial derivatives @xmath38 and @xmath39 and give rise to a so - called _ non - equilibrium pressure _ and a _ non - equilibrium temperature_. for simplicity , however , in this paper we do _ not _ consider such a possibility , and @xmath69 and @xmath81 are assumed to be _",
    "constant_.    the algebraic source term on the right - hand side of equation  ( [ eqn.deformation ] ) describes the shear strain dissipation due to material element rearrangements , and the source term on the right - hand side of ( [ eqn.heatflux ] ) describes the relaxation of the thermal impulse due to heat exchange between material elements .    after the total energy potential has been specified , one can write all fluxes and source terms in an explicit form . thus , for the energy @xmath86 given by  ( [ eq : e_2 ] ) , we have @xmath87 , hence the shear stresses are @xmath88 and the strain dissipation source term is @xmath89 where we have chosen @xmath90 , with @xmath91 the determinant of @xmath31 and @xmath92 being the strain relaxation time , or , in other words , the time scale that characterizes how long a material element is connected with its neighbor elements before rearrangement .",
    "note , that the determinant of @xmath31 must satisfy the _ constraint _",
    "@xmath93 where @xmath94 is the density at a reference configuration , see @xcite .",
    "furthermore , from the energy potential @xmath73 the heat flux vector follows with @xmath95 directly as @xmath96 for the thermal impulse relaxation source term , we choose @xmath97 , and hence @xmath98 it contains another characteristic relaxation time @xmath99 that is associated to heat conduction .    the motivation for this particular choice of @xmath100 and @xmath101 can be found later in section [ sec : asy ] , where a formal asymptotic analysis of the model is presented , and where the connection with classical navier - stokes - fourier theory is established in the stiff limit @xmath102 and @xmath103 .      in this section ,",
    "we discuss a few additional important properties of the hpr model .",
    "we first illustrate the relation of the hpr model to the laws of thermodynamics and the important role played by the total energy potential .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate that the hpr model is compatible with the first and second law of thermodynamics , and that this automatically implies that the hpr model is a _",
    "hyperbolic _ system of pdes , _",
    "i.e. _ the cauchy problem for the system   is well - posed .",

    "this is in general not guaranteed and one needs to provide evidences that a solution satisfying all the pdes of the system does exist .    in 1961 , after discovering the mutual relations between thermodynamics , well - posedness of the initial value problem for systems of conservation laws and stability of numerical schemes , godunov  @xcite concluded that an overdetermined system of conservation laws representing a continuum mechanics model is consistent if it is compatible with the first law of thermodynamics , i.e. with the total energy conservation .",

    "therefore , the scales can interact only through an energy exchange , and the total energy potential has to be involved in some way in the mathematical formulation of this interaction .",
    "indeed , the energy transfer from meso- to macroscale , @xmath138 , is known as _",
    "reversible _ energy transformation , and is controlled by the momentum fluxes , and as we have seen in the previous paragraph , these fluxes are given by the gradients @xmath38 and @xmath123 .",
    "the energy transfer from meso- to microscale , @xmath139 , is an _ irreversible _",
    "transformation , which is controlled by the dissipative source terms in the governing equations for the distortion tensor , the thermal impulse , and the entropy .",
    "thus , it is natural to expect that these dissipative source terms in the hpr model are also generated by the energy potential , via its partial derivatives with respect to the state variables .",
    "indeed , the total energy conservation principle holds regardless of whether dissipation is present , or not .",
    "thus , even if the dissipative source terms are present , we anyway have to have zero on the right - hand side of the total energy conservation law .",
    "since the hpr model is an overdetermined system of pdes , we require that the summation identity holds . hence , each dissipative source term is multiplied by the corresponding factor ( conjugate state variables  ) and the sum must vanish .",
    "let us denote the source terms in equations and by @xmath140 and @xmath141 , respectively , while the source term in the entropy equation is denoted by @xmath142 . in the summation identity  ,",
    "they are multiplied by @xmath143 , @xmath144 and @xmath145 , respectively .",
    "total energy conservation requires that the right hand side of vanishes , i.e. @xmath146 the only freedom we have to satisfy the total energy conservation law is to set @xmath147 at that point , we recall that the thermodynamics of dissipative processes requires that the entropy can not decrease , and hence the entropy production has to be nonnegative . a simple possibility to guarantee",
    "this is to assume that the terms @xmath148 and @xmath149 are proportional to the gradients @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively , with some positive coefficients .",
    "this makes the entropy source term a positive definite quadratic form , which guarantees that the entropy does not decrease .",
    "since the functions @xmath150 and @xmath151 are positive , in this paper we have simply chosen @xmath152      understanding the _ characteristic _ structure of a hyperbolic system is an important step in studying the solution properties , because the solution of a hyperbolic model is a combination of waves propagating along the _ characteristic lines _ , _",
    "e.g. _ see  @xcite . in this section",
    "we study the characteristic structure of the hpr model .",
    "first we shall present the characteristic structure of the viscous part of the hpr model ( equations  ( [ eqn.conti ] ) , ( [ eqn.momentum ] ) , ( [ eqn.deformation ] ) and ( [ eqn.energy ] ) ) , then we discuss the characteristic structure of the heat conducting part ( equations and ) , and eventually we close this section by presenting the structure of the entire model  ( [ eqn.hpr ] ) .",
    "it is also important to recall that the characteristic speeds of a hyperbolic model with stiff dissipative source terms are not the true sound speeds in the media , because these apparent sound speeds are strongly influenced by the dissipative processes giving rise to the phenomena called sound dispersion .",
    "in fact , the characteristic speeds of a hyperbolic system with stiff dissipative source terms are the high frequency limits for sound speeds  @xcite .",
    "we also note that the hpr model is fundamentally different from the classical parabolic nsf theory in the way it treats viscous and heat conducting phenomena . in the classical nsf theory ,",
    "the transport phenomena are treated by means of phenomenological transport relations such as , for example , newton s law of viscosity and fourier s law of heat conduction , while in the hpr model all transport phenomena are treated from the wave propagation point of view .",
    "thus , as it will be shown below , there are four types of sound waves in the hpr model , one for the transport of longitudinal ( or pressure ) perturbations , two for shear perturbations , and one for heat transfer , in contrast to only one pressure wave in the nsf model .",

    "the full basis consisting of eigenvectors of the matrix @xmath158 can be also obtained in the same way as it is done in @xcite .",
    "we note that in  @xcite , the time evolution equation for @xmath159 was used instead of equation  .    in order to illustrate the characteristic structure of we restrict ourselves to the consideration of a fluid ( or solid ) at the rest state @xmath160 , _ i.e. _ @xmath161 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 .",
    "if the internal energy @xmath54 is considered in the form  , or , and @xmath164 in the form then matrix @xmath158 , @xmath165 , looks as follows ( we omit the subscript 1 in what follows ) @xmath166 its non - zero eigenvalues are @xmath167 , @xmath168 .",
    "thus , the eigenvalues @xmath169 are ( in general , they are distinct if shear flow is present ) transverse , or shear , characteristic speeds , while @xmath170 is the longitudinal characteristic speed . in the framework of solid mechanics ,",
    "the existence of two types of waves comes with no surprise , but this is much less obvious for fluid mechanics .",
    "however , this fact is in full agreement with the causality principle and the wave propagation point of view on the transport phenomena , as it was already mentioned above .",
    "yet another point has to be explained .",
    "one may note that the characteristic velocity corresponding to the propagation of pressure perturbations in fluids modeled by eos ( [ eq : ideal_gas_eos ] ) or ( [ eq : stiff_gas_eos ] ) is @xmath171 , while we get @xmath172 for @xmath173 .",
    "in fact , this is not a paradox .",
    "it is necessary to recall that for the hyperbolic pdes with stiff dissipative source terms like system  , the characteristic speeds are not the _ true sound speeds _ , but the true sound speeds are the result of a coupling of the non - dissipative waves modeled by the left hand side of   and the dissipative processes modeled by the algebraic source terms , and therefore the true sound speeds can be obtained only via a _ dispersion analysis_. however , such an analysis is outside the scopes of this paper , some details of it are given just to demonstrate that there is no controversy between the sound speeds predicted by the hpr model and experimental observations on sound propagation in fluids .",
    "the dispersion relation for a hyperbolic system of pdes of the form  ( [ eq : quasilinear ] ) with algebraic dissipative source terms is  @xcite @xmath174 where @xmath175 is the angular frequency , @xmath176 is the wave frequency , @xmath177 , @xmath178 is the complex wave number , @xmath179 is the imaginary unit , matrices @xmath180 and @xmath181 are taken at the rest state @xmath160 , and @xmath68 is the identity matrix of the same size as @xmath182 and @xmath183 .",
    "once the solution @xmath184 to  ( [ eq : dispers_rel ] ) is found , the phase velocity , @xmath185 , and the attenuation factor , @xmath71 , of a harmonic sound wave of frequency @xmath186 are given by @xmath187    equation  ( [ eq : dispers_rel ] ) has six nontrivial solutions , four corresponding to the transverse waves @xmath188 and two corresponding to the longitudinal waves @xmath189 where @xmath190 .",
    "thus , for the _ longitudinal sound waves _ the phase velocity and the attenuation factor are @xmath191 and for _ shear sound waves _ they are @xmath192    by a direct verification , one can see that the low ( @xmath193 ) and high ( @xmath194 ) frequency limits of @xmath195 are @xmath171 and @xmath196 , accordingly , while for @xmath197 they are @xmath198 and @xmath69 .",
    "this clearly indicates that ( i ) perturbations of any frequency propagate at finite speeds in contrast to the classical nsf theory and that ( ii ) the low frequency sound waves propagate at velocities @xmath199 what we in fact use to call the sound speed in fluids . fig .",

    "<S> this paper is concerned with the numerical solution of the _ unified _ first order hyperbolic formulation of continuum mechanics recently proposed by peshkov & romenski @xcite , further denoted as _ </S>",
    "<S> hpr model_. in that framework , the viscous stresses are computed from the so - called _ distortion tensor _ @xmath0 , which is one of the primary state variables in the proposed first order system . </S>",
    "<S> a very important key feature of the hpr model is its ability to describe _ at the same time _ the behavior of inviscid and viscous compressible newtonian and non - newtonian _ fluids _ with heat conduction , as well as the behavior of elastic and visco - plastic _ </S>",
    "<S> solids_. actually , the model treats viscous and inviscid fluids as generalized visco - plastic solids . </S>",
    "<S> this is achieved via a stiff source term that accounts for strain relaxation in the evolution equations of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> also heat conduction is included via a first order hyperbolic evolution equation of the thermal impulse , from which the heat flux is computed . </S>",
    "<S> the governing pde system is hyperbolic and fully consistent with the first and the second principle of thermodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> it is also fundamentally _ different _ from first order maxwell - cattaneo - type relaxation models based on extended irreversible thermodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the hpr model represents therefore a _ novel _ and _ unified _ description of continuum mechanics , which applies at the same time to _ fluid mechanics _ and _ solid mechanics_. in this paper , the direct connection between the hpr model and the classical hyperbolic - parabolic navier - stokes - fourier theory is established for the first time via a formal asymptotic analysis in the stiff relaxation limit .    from a numerical point of view , the governing partial differential equations are very challenging , since they form a large nonlinear hyperbolic pde system that includes stiff source terms and non - conservative products . </S>",
    "<S> we apply the successful family of one - step ader - weno finite volume ( fv ) and ader discontinuous galerkin ( dg ) finite element schemes to the hpr model in the stiff relaxation limit , and compare the numerical results with exact or numerical reference solutions obtained for the euler and navier - stokes equations . </S>",
    "<S> numerical convergence results are also provided . to show the universality of the hpr model , the paper is rounded - off with an application to wave propagation in elastic solids , for which one only needs to switch off the strain relaxation source term in the governing pde system .    </S>",
    "<S> we provide various examples showing that for the purpose of _ flow visualization _ , the distortion tensor @xmath0 seems to be particularly useful .    </S>",
