    "the proofs of arzel s bounded convergence theorem first offered by arzel and hausdorff were long , difficult , and contained gaps .",
    "indeed , most introductory analysis texts record the result but do not supply a proof . for an excellent history of the problem and a cogent explanation of the hypotheses necessity see @xcite .",
    "many other proofs that do not make use of measure theory have been furnished by mathematicians such as banach and reisz , using techniques ranging from set theory to functional analysis ",
    "see @xcite for more about these proofs .",
    "our goal is to establish the following theorem using only riemann s definition of integration and basic principles of elementary analysis :    [ premain ] _",
    "( arzel , 1885 ) _ let @xmath0\\rightarrow\\mathbb{r}$ ] be a sequence of riemann integrable functions with the pointwise limit @xmath1\\rightarrow\\ \\mathbb{r}$ ] which is also integrable .",
    "suppose further that there is a constant @xmath2 bounding the @xmath3 uniformly : @xmath4 for every @xmath5 $ ] and @xmath6",
    ". then @xmath7 .    by considering the related sequence of functions @xmath8 and rescaling",
    ", one sees that we may assume that both the domain and codomain of our functions are the unit interval and that the limit function is zero :    [ main ] let @xmath9\\rightarrow[0,1]$ ] be a sequence of integrable functions that tend pointwise to zero",
    ". then @xmath10 .",
    "we will prove the contrapositive . by passing to a subsequence if necessary ,",
    "we may assume without loss of generality that the integrals @xmath11 are all above a fixed bound .",
    "we will find a point @xmath12 $ ] such that infinitely many @xmath13 are also above a fixed bound .",
    "we conclude that neither the subsequence nor the original sequence converges pointwise to zero .",
    "so , suppose there is an @xmath14 such that @xmath15 for every @xmath6 .",
    "we can associate to each @xmath3 a finite union @xmath16 of open intervals whose total length is at least @xmath14 such that @xmath3 only takes on values above @xmath14 on @xmath16 . to see this , note that the upper / lower sum definition of the riemann integral tells us that we may inscribe a finite number of rectangles under the graph of @xmath3 whose combined area is at least @xmath17 . since the short rectangles ( those whose height is less than @xmath14 ) have a total area of at most @xmath14 , the total area of the tall rectangles is at least @xmath14 .",
    "taking @xmath16 to be the open intervals that constitute the bases of these tall rectangles , we conclude that the length of @xmath16 is at least @xmath14 since the height of any rectangle is at most one .",
    "it is clear that @xmath3 is above @xmath14 on @xmath16 .",
    "finding a point common to infinitely many @xmath16 gives us the desired point @xmath18 of nonconvergence to zero .",
    "equivalently , we will show that if @xmath19 , then the intersection of all @xmath20 contains a point .",
    "[ secondary ] let @xmath21 be a nested , decreasing sequence of open sets in @xmath22 $ ] , each of which contains a finite union of open intervals whose total length is above some fixed bound @xmath14 .",
    "then @xmath23 is nonempty .",
    "measure theory immediately tells us that the intersection is not merely nonempty but , indeed , of positive measure . that we must settle for such a weak conclusion is a testament to the theory s power . to establish this theorem by elementary means ,",
    "we introduce a natural tree structure on the sequence @xmath21 .",
    "as @xmath20 is open , it decomposes uniquely as a countable disjoint union of open intervals .",
    "each such interval is a node at depth @xmath24 ; we speak of the properties of each interchangeably .",
    "the children of a node @xmath25 , an interval of @xmath20 , are the intervals of @xmath26 that are subintervals of @xmath25 .",
    "we will prune this tree until the sequence of open sets which remains can be easily seen to have a nonempty intersection .",
    "we may assume without loss of generality that each @xmath20 is a finite union of intervals . to see this , enumerate the intervals that constitute @xmath20 and notice that the total length of the first @xmath27 intervals is a monotone sequence bounded above by one .",
    "we may thus truncate the sequence of intervals such that the length of the resulting finite union of intervals is arbitrarily close to the limit length .",
    "truncate each @xmath20 to within @xmath28 of this limit . by discarding the descendants of the truncated tails",
    "we ensure that the resulting sequence of open sets is still nested .",
    "the lengths of the finite unions of intervals that remain at each depth are all at least @xmath29 .",
    "we may further assume that there are no _ terminating nodes _",
    "( nodes whose descendants end at a finite depth ) .",
    "they may be safely discarded as the nonterminating nodes of depth @xmath24 wholly contain @xmath30 for sufficiently large @xmath31 .",
    "so , all intervals can be assumed to have descendants at every deeper level .",
    "the case where there is an infinite path down the tree such that the lengths of the intervals traversed by the path stays above a fixed number is easy .",
    "the midpoints of the intervals traversed have a cluster point ; it is in the intersection of all the @xmath20s .",
    "we may thus assume that as we travel down any path , the lengths of the intervals traversed vanish .",
    "one last reduction : all the nodes _ split _ ( have at least two descendants at sufficiently large depths ) .",
    "each @xmath20 is the disjoint union of @xmath32 , the splitting nodes , and @xmath33 , the nodes with only one descendant at each further depth .",
    "the descendants of @xmath33 at depth @xmath31 vanish in length as @xmath31 increases .",
    "this means the descendants of @xmath32 , and thus @xmath32 itself , are longer than some fixed uniform bound . we can discard @xmath33 at every level",
    "now , every node is nonterminating and splits .",
    "note that any node @xmath25 splits into two descendants and that one of these subintervals splits , implying that @xmath25 has three descendants at some depth .",
    "the midpoints of the outermost of these nodes define a closed subinterval of @xmath25 that wholly contains the middle descendant . starting with any initial node and inductively applying this construction to each",
    "such yielded middle node gives a nested sequence of closed sets whose nonempty intersection is contained in @xmath23 .",
