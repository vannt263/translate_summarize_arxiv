    "since the discovery of quantized conductance in atomic - size contacts , there has been considerable interest in studying the electronic transport in nanoscale systems .",
    "so far , a number of calculation methods to investigate the electron transport properties through a nanostructure embedded by semi - infinite electrodes have been proposed such as the nonequilibrium green s function ( negf ) method @xcite , recursion transfer matrix method @xcite , lippmann - schwinger method @xcite and overbridging boundary - matching ( obm ) method @xcite . among them , the negf approach is most commonly used in connection with tight - binding models and first - principles methods for solving transport problems . in the negf formalism ,",
    "localized basis sets consisting of either atomic orbitals or gaussians are extensively utilized because it is straightforward to partition a whole system into a transition region and electrodes .",
    "however , the incompleteness of the basis sets sometimes degrades the accuracy @xcite and the diffuse functions in the basis sets prevent us from achieving high - performance computing on massively parallel computers .    on the other hand ,",
    "the calculation method using the real - space finite - difference ( rsfd ) approach  @xcite does not suffer from these problems .",
    "however , the linear - equation solver used to obtain the perturbed green s functions of a transition region becomes computationally intensive as the numbers of grid points and sampling energy points increase .",
    "more efficient linear - equation solvers are required to perform large - scale first - principles transport calculations by the negf approach using the rsfd scheme .    in this study",
    ", we propose an efficient scheme to compute perturbed green s functions that combines the procedure developed in the obm method and the shifted conjugate orthogonal conjugate gradient ( cocg ) algorithm @xcite . in the negf method ,",
    "the matrix to be inverted includes the self - energy terms of electrodes , which are energy - dependent and destroy the shift invariance of the krylov subspace with respect to the energy of electrons .",
    "the total computational cost of obtaining perturbed green s functions is proportional to the number of energy points . on the other hand ,",
    "unperturbed green s functions are first calculated by the obm method and then the effect of the electrodes is introduced in the wavefunction - matching procedure .",
    "since the matrix to be inverted does not include nonlinear energy dependent terms , the unperturbed green s functions are obtained by solving a set of shifted linear equations with respect to the energy .",
    "the shifted linear equations can be solved by the shifted cocg method , in which the calculation is actually carried out only for a reference energy point and the solutions for the other shifted energy points are obtained with a moderate computational cost owing to the shift invariance of the krylov subspace . employing the mathematically strict relationship between perturbed and unperturbed green s functions developed in the obm method @xcite , one can greatly decrease the computational cost of the linear - equation solver .",

    "<S> we propose an efficient procedure to obtain green s functions by combining the shifted conjugate orthogonal conjugate gradient ( shifted cocg ) method with the nonequilibrium green s function ( negf ) method based on a real - space finite - difference ( rsfd ) approach . the bottleneck of the computation in the negf scheme is matrix inversion of the hamiltonian including the self - energy terms of electrodes to obtain perturbed green s function in the transition region . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure first computes unperturbed green s functions and calculates perturbed green s functions from the unperturbed ones using a mathematically strict relation . </S>",
    "<S> since the matrices to be inverted to obtain the unperturbed green s functions are sparse , complex - symmetric and shifted for a given set of sampling energy points , we can use the shifted cocg method , in which once the green s function for a reference energy point has been calculated , the green s functions for the other energy points can be obtained with a moderate computational cost . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the transport properties of a c@xmath0@(10,10 ) carbon nanotube ( cnt ) peapod suspended by ( 10,10)cnts as an example of a large - scale transport calculation . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed scheme opens the possibility of performing large - scale rsfd - negf transport calculations using massively parallel computers without the loss of accuracy originating from the incompleteness of the localized basis set . </S>"
