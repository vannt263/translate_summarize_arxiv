    "in the current paradigm of galaxy formation , the building block of structure is a dark matter halo , consisting mainly of non - baryonic dark matter together with @xmath0 baryons in the form of gas .",
    "dark halos are thought to originate from the collapse of primordial density fluctuations , growing unimpeded until virial equilibrium is reached . within these halos",
    "the baryonic component dissipates energy , collapsing further towards the center and eventually forming the visible galaxy .",
    "subsequent mergers redistribute the matter within halos .    to work out the details of the basic picture , which goes back to @xcite , it is essential to determine the connection between the visible galaxies and dark halos .",
    "strong gravitational lensing by galaxies is potentially a very useful way of doing this , since the total mass of a lensing galaxy is relatively easy to constrain .",
    "also , since lensing tends to be more effective for distant galaxies ( @xmath1 to 1 ) , it nicely complements the stellar - dynamical techniques applicable in nearby galaxies .",
    "the difficulty with lensing galaxies ( that is to say , galaxies producing multiple images of background sources ) is that they are relatively rare . till",
    "recently , only about 80 were known .",
    "but recently , 28 new galaxy lenses have been discovered by the sloan lens acs survey ( slacs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) thanks to a new survey strategy , which eventually may double the number of strong lenses .",
    "the method is to select galaxies from the sloan survey @xcite that have emission lines indicating high - redshift background objects , and then to image these candidates using the advanced camera for surveys on the hubble space telescope .",
    "a basic analysis of a sample of galaxy lenses is to fit simple lens models and then compute @xmath2 and its evolution with redshift .",
    "this was first done by @xcite .",
    "an extension is to place lensing galaxies on the fundamental plane of ellipticals , using a measured or model - derived velocity dispersion @xcite",
    ". other work @xcite compares lens models with the measured dispersions to constrain the mass profiles of the galaxies .",
    "these studies have found no unexpected features or trends with redshift , and argue in favor of passive evolution .",
    "a more detailed analysis involves modeling both the lens mass distribution and the stellar population .",
    "the star - formation history is not well - constrained by the observed fluxes and colours and must be marginalized over , but the stellar mass is fairly insensitive to model assumptions apart from the initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "the lensing mass distribution , when aggressively modeled , turns out to have much larger uncertainties than simple models assume ; nevertheless , the uncertainties can be estimated and useful conclusions drawn .",
    "@xcite found massive ellipticals to show a transition from no significant dark matter within @xmath3 to dark - matter dominance by @xmath4 , whereas lower - mass galaxies showed no significant dark halos even at @xmath4 .",
    "the radial gradient in the dark - matter fraction agreed with the results on nearby galaxies derived from stellar dynamics @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extend the detailed comparison of stellar and total mass to two dimensions , using a subsample of the slacs lenses .",
    "all the slacs objects have a background galaxy that is lensed into two or four extended images . in nine of the objects",
    ", we can identify small features within the extended images . for lenses showing point - like multiply - imaged features",
    "there is a well - developed technique for reconstructing the projected mass distribution , along with uncertainty estimates @xcite .",
    "accordingly we take these nine lenses as our sample .",
    "the stellar mass content is estimated by combining the available photometry of the lensing galaxies with population - synthesis models @xcite .",
    "is considered at two different redshifts as labelled .",
    "the shaded regions span the model predictions when assuming a wide range of @xmath5 models ( i.e. , an exponentially decaying star formation history at fixed metallicity ) .",
    "the dark / light shaded regions correspond to a formation redshift of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , and all span a range of star formation timescales ( @xmath8 ) and metallicities ( @xmath9).,width=326 ]",
    "we use the pixelated lens reconstruction method implemented in the _ pixelens _ program .",
    "the algorithm is motivated and described in detail in @xcite , but basically it consists of two ideas .",
    "the first idea is to express the lensing data as a set of linear constraint equations on the mass distribution .",
    "we assume that the centroids of multiple images are measured with negligible error , which  at hst resolution  is a very good approximation .",
    "then the remaining unknowns are the source position and the lens mass distribution , and both of these enter the lens equation linearly ( cf .  equation 5 in * ? ? ?",
    "the lens is expressed as a superposition of mass tiles or pixels , although a superposition of basis functions is also possible @xcite .",
    "a prior on the lens can be expressed as linear inequalities .",
    "specifically , we require the mass distribution to ( i )  be non - negative , ( ii )  be centrally concentrated , with the local density gradient pointing @xmath10 away from the center , ( iii )  be inversion symmetric ( i.e. symmetric with respect to rotation by @xmath11 ; optional ) , ( iv )  have no pixel more than twice the sum of its neighbors , except possibly the central pixel , and ( v )  the circularly averaged mass profile to be steeper than @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the projected radius . item ( v ) is assumed ( for galaxies ) since stellar dynamics or other methods never give @xmath14 as shallow as @xmath15 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these various equations and inequalities give an underdetermined linear system analogous to schwarzschild s problem in stellar dynamics .",
    "the second idea ( suggested by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is to sample the mass maps allowed by the data and prior , through a monte - carlo method .",
    "the result is an ensemble of lens models .",
    "uncertainties on any parameter of the lens can be derived from the model ensemble in the usual way .",
    "the ensemble - average will automatically satisfy the data and prior constraints , since they are linear .",
    "this makes the ensemble - average model a good choice for representing a single model . for a detailed illustration of the ensemble method , see the appendix in @xcite .     while the contours show @xmath16 .",
    "the latter are in multiplicative steps of @xmath17 ( like a magnitude scale ) .",
    "the star symbols mark multiply - imaged features of the background source .",
    "the bar in each panel indicates 2  kpc.,width=326 ]    for each lens we computed an ensemble of 200 mass maps of @xmath18 pixels each . to derive radial profiles",
    "we circularly - averaged the mass maps .",
    "this procedure naturally yields ensembles of radial profiles , hence an estimate of the uncertainty .    in the lens models",
    "the enclosed mass is best constrained at projected radii similar to the images themselves ( roughly speaking , around the einstein radius ) , whereas at smaller and larger radii , the enclosed mass becomes progressively more uncertain .",
    "this is simply the well - known steepness degeneracy in lensing theory ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as a result , the enclosed mass profile and its error - bars have a characteristic butterfly shape .",
    "to what extent velocity dispersions can break lensing degeneracies remains an open question .",
    "studies using velocity dispersions as constraints on lenses tend to be optimistic",
    ". however , stellar - dynamical degeneracies associated with kinematics are also known @xcite and it is not clear that these will be orthogonal to lensing degeneracies . also , current methods for incorporating kinematics into lens models assume spherical symmetry .",
    "for these reasons we do not include kinematics in the lens models .",
    "we do not attempt to fit the extended images .",
    "now , a model fitted to point - like images automatically provide a predictions for arcs that would be generated by a conical light profile ( i.e. a circularly symmetric model ; @xcite ) and these predicted arcs generally do yield a good approximation to observed arcs .",
    "hence disregarding the extended images does not sacrifice as much information as might at first appear .",
    "fitting a better source distribution is a straightforward linear image - reconstruction problem if the lens model is fixed . but using the source structure to improve the lens fit is much harder .",
    "several papers propose schemes that iteratively fit lens and source models .",
    "but they either assume a restricted parameterized form for the lens ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or allow the lens model to be free form @xcite but need it to be close to a starting guess .     having a conical light profile .",

    "the lens - galaxy images were further corrected for galactic reddening using the available dust maps @xcite and a standard model for extinction by galactic dust @xcite .",
    "we then spatially rebinned the photometry of each galaxy into the same @xmath18 pixelation used for the lens models of that galaxy .",
    "these pixels are @xmath21 to @xmath22 across , depending on the system , amounting to @xmath23 to 1kpc at the lensing galaxy .",
    "for the stellar - population analysis we apply the so - called @xmath5 models , which assume an exponentially decaying star formation history at fixed metallicity .",
    "three parameters describe each model : the formation epoch ( i.e. , when star - formation starts ) , the formation timescale and the metallicity .",
    "we explore a grid of @xmath24 models and allow in our estimates only those models whose photometry is compatible with the observations , treating the @xmath18 pixels described above as independent .",
    "one colour is not sufficient for an estimate of the stellar ages and metallicities , but is enough to constrain the stellar mass content , because of the wide spectral range covered by @xmath25 .",

    "statement ( ii ) above is addressed by figure  [ fig : profile ] , which shows the circularly - averaged enclosed mass profiles , with 90% bayesian confidence intervals .",

    "one envelope of the butterfly shape is expected to be approximately @xmath38 , because the prior requires @xmath16 to be steeper than @xmath12 ( see   2 ) .",
    "this is indeed the case , as illustrated in the bottom - middle panel of the figure .",
    "the other envelope has a more complicated origin , having to do with the steepest non - negative profile that can reproduce the observed image positions .",

    "the simple power law defined by @xcite and traditionally used as an approximation to the imf gives stellar masses @xmath44 higher .",
    "for some galaxies presented here , the implied stellar mass exceeds the total mass as extracted from lensing .",
    "the upper - left panel of figure  [ fig : profile ] shows the stellar mass profile of j0037 for a salpeter imf , which is clearly incompatible with the lensing results .",
    "hence , we can infer from our results that a salpeter imf is too bottom - heavy .",
    "our conclusion agrees with @xcite , who used stellar dynamics to estimate the total mass in a sample of 25 e / s0 galaxies .",
    "we can compare the aperture masses ( stellar and total ) with previous work .",
    "the aperture radius @xmath43 we take as @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the projected radii of the outermost and innermost lenses images .",
    "this @xmath43 approximates the radius within which lensing usefully constraints on the mass . in @xcite",
    "the aperture radius was set for each galaxy by seeing where the error bars became too large to be useful ; such a procedure tends to give slightly smaller aperture radii , but we will disregard the difference here . figure  [ fig : mtot ] shows the aperture @xmath48 and @xmath49 in this work along with the earlier lensing work ( labelled castles : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the stellar - dynamical work ( labelled sauron : * ? ? ?",
    "the galaxies from these three independent data sets all show a clear trend towards a larger amount of dark matter in more massive galaxies .",
    "the observed tilt of the fundamental plane suggests a scaling of @xmath42 @xcite , which appears consistent with all the data .",
    "however , the present sample is too small to test a scaling law , especially because the range of aperture masses is small . also noticeable in the figure",
    "is that the slacs galaxies tend to have @xmath50 , unlike the castles galaxies which cover a larger range .",
    "this is a selection bias due to the slacs survey strategy .    in table",
    "[ tab : sample ] we include an estimate of the dynamical mass , using the popular relation @xmath51 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in the table @xmath43 represents , as explained above , the aperture radius usefully mapped by lensing . notice that for j0737 ( @xmath52 ) the dynamical mass estimate is much larger than the lensing or stellar masses within @xmath53 , whereas j1330 ( @xmath54 ) is better mapped by the lensed images and give compatible results between @xmath48 and the dynamical mass .",
    "finally , figure  [ fig : cmaps ] shows stellar and dark - matter maps in false colour . here",
    "the brightness represents @xmath33 ; the colour represents the dark - matter fraction ( red means all stellar , blue means all dark ) ; the hue represents the uncertainty ( pale means more uncertain ) .",
    "the appendix explains the colour - coding scheme more precisely . at the centers of the galaxies we see",
    "bright white , meaning high density but with large uncertainty .",
    "this turns into pale red , indicating mainly stellar mass .",
    "further out we see faint pale blue , indicating mainly dark matter .",
    "this figure , though admittedly ad hoc in its choice of colour coding , provides for the first time an intuitive visual image of the distribution of dark matter in individual galaxies .",
    "the potential usefulness of early - type lensing galaxies for understanding the interdependence of baryons and dark matter in galaxy formation and evolution is widely appreciated .",
    "lensing can be used to map the total mass and starlight can be used to map the baryons . in this paper",
    "we do this for nine galaxies from the slacs survey by @xcite . from the lensing data we derived free - form pixelated models for the total mass , and from the galaxy photometry we computed stellar population - synthesis models . in both casses we generated monte - carlo ensembles of models , in order to marginalize over unknowns such as lensing degeneracies and star - formation histories , thus obtaining realistic uncertainties .",
    "the technique is basically the same as in @xcite , but whereas the earlier work only compared radial profiles now we compare stellar and total mass in 2d .",
    "related work has been done on larger samples of galaxies , but is limited to fitting simple parameterized models for the lens , and does not model the stellar populations at all .",
    "the 2d mass maps are shown in figures [ fig : mass ] and [ fig : cmaps ] .",
    "the former overlays contours of @xmath16 on a grayscale of @xmath33 .",
    "the latter shows the same information with uncertainties as well , all encoded in false colour : red for stellar mass , blue for dark , and pale versus coloured for uncertainty .",
    "it is evident that ( a )  these galaxies are dominated by stars in the inner regions , but mainly dark matter in the outer regions , and ( b )  stellar and dark components are well - aligned , but neither has a simple elliptical shape .",
    "one can of course still compute an ellipticity defined as a moment , and this is shown in figure  [ fig : ellip ] .",
    "we see that ellipticities of the stellar and total mass are uncorrelated in magnitude but are almost perfectly aligned",
    ". it would be interesting to see if this is true of galaxy - formation simulations .",
    "the profiles ( figure  [ fig : profile ] ) show that dark matter halos begin to dominate around the half - light radius , although some galaxies seem to present a stronger contribution from dark matter even inside @xmath3 ( e.g. , j2300 ) .",
    "the present sample is too small to extract any strong correlation of the dark matter distribution with global properties such as total mass or luminosity .",
    "however , the trend found previously @xcite , namely that there should be more dark matter in more massive galaxies , with a scaling of roughly @xmath42 ( which is equivalent to the tilt of the fundamental plane ) is compatible with the combined data of lensing galaxies ( labelled castles and slacs ) along with the dynamical analysis of local galaxies with the sauron integral field unit @xcite .",
    "the top - left panel of figure  [ fig : profile ] also shows that a salpeter ( 1955 ) imf can not be used to estimate stellar masses as the population synthesis models predict too much stellar mass compared to the total mass obtained from our lensing studies .",
    "this result also agrees with the analysis of the sauron sample .",
    "we emphasize that stellar and total masses are obtained from different data through models of different physical processes .",
    "there is no tuning to give similar results . that the stellar and total densities come out compatible at the centers",
    "where the baryon content is expected to dominate the mass budget indicates that systematic effects are not significant .",

    "for each galaxy we have sky - projected maps of three quantities : total mass , uncertainty , and stellar - mass fraction . how can we somehow encode these into red , green , and blue , thus making a false - colour map ?    in general ,",
    "suppose we want to represent the following three quantities : @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 both vary between 0 and 1 .",
    "a plausible mapping into intensities @xmath58 of red , green , and blue is @xmath59 this gives total intensity @xmath60 regardless of @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "if @xmath61 , the colour will vary from blue at @xmath62 to magenta at @xmath63 to red at @xmath64 . as the uncertainty @xmath57 increases , these colours will become paler , turning into white at @xmath65 .",
    "the above scheme on its own is , however , not enough to produce useful false - colour maps .",
    "that is because the response of eyes to colour is highly nonlinear , contrary to what equation ( [ rgb ] ) presupposes . in practical image - processing , heuristic scale stretchings are always necessary .",
    "after some experimentation , we found the stretchings @xmath66 to be useful . @xmath33 and @xmath16 represent the surface mass density from the photometric and lensing analysis , respectively , in a given pixel .",
    "@xmath57 is the fractional uncertainty in the total surface mass density , which dominates the error budget .",
