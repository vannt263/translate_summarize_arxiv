    "the intermediate and soft - state spectra are dominated by the disk component comptonized by a low - temperature plasma , but then followed by a significant hard tail clearly requiring the presence of both hot thermal electrons and nonthermal ones .",
    "overall , the high - energy parts of the spectra are quite similar to the spectra of grs 1915 + 105 shown in @xcite .",
    "the hard - state spectra are similar to those of the state @xmath3 ( in the classification of @xcite ) , with the hard x - ray photon indices of @xmath4 .",
    "the soft state spectra are then similar to the spectrum in the @xmath5 state of @xcite , with both objects showing the characteristic hard tail with @xmath6 .",
    "note that in the case of grs 1915 + 105 , the presence of nonthermal electrons is required not only in the soft state but also in the hard one .",

    ", somewhat arbitrarily , we define the hard and the soft state by the criterion of the countrate smaller and greater than 15 s@xmath7 , respectively .",

    "the maximum is broad and flat in the hard state , whereas it forms a sharp peak followed by a secondary one in the soft state .",
    "we also see different shapes around the minimum .",
    "the differences indicate changes in the source configuration taking place during state transitions .",
    "we caution , however , that our criterion to distinguish the states should be phase - dependent as the orbital modulation changes the countrate . due to this effect , a state with the countrate near 15 s@xmath7 gives contribution to either hard or the soft state depending on the phase .",

    "the edge energy and depth indicates the presence of a plasma with he - like fe with the thomson optical depth @xmath11 . due to the low energy resolution of the pca , it is impossible to determine the presence of any narrow absorption or emission spectral features .      [ sax ]",

    "[ individual][groups ] . in this preliminary study , we fit only data from the mecs ( which has energy resolution much better than that of the pca ) , see fig .",
    "we find that the model described above gives a very poor fit with @xmath8 as it can not account for the discrete spectral features present in the @xmath01.78 kev band .",
    "thus , our new model consists of the comptonization / reflection continuum ( as above ) and a component from a photoionized plasma , all absorbed in neutral medium .",
    "the absorber includes both the interstellar medium and the wind from the companion , with the best - fit total @xmath9 @xmath10 .",
    "we also include an fe k@xmath11 line from an accretion disk @xcite .",
    "the emission from the photoionized plasma ( calculated using xstar @xcite ) turns out to be crucial .",
    "it improves the fit dramatically , to @xmath12 .",
    "this is due to that component accounting for the strong emission features from highly ionized s , si and fe present in the mecs spectrum .",
    "note that the _ bepposax _ observation lasted more than nine orbital periods ; thus , our results regard the phase - averaged spectrum .",
    "this is our first , and preliminary , attempt of high resolution spectroscopy for cyg x-3 .",
    "we plan to apply our model to other _ bepposax _ observations and those by",
    "we have obtained several major new results regarding x - rays from cyg x-3 , a preliminary account of them is given here .",
    "we have obtained the first classification of its x - ray spectra , forming 5 classes defined by the spectral hardness and the strength of the soft , disk - like component . each class",
    "is well fitted by a physical model including comptonization by both thermal and nonthermal electrons and compton reflection .",
    "apart from the presence of the very strong absorption in cyg x-3 , its intrinsic spectra are strikingly similar to those of the black - hole binary grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "this represents a strong argument for the presence of a black hole in cyg x-3 .    in the softest state",
    ", we have found a high - energy tail with @xmath6 extending above 100 kev .",
    "such a spectral feature also appears in the brightest states of some other black - hole binaries , in particular grs 1915 + 105 @xcite and xte j1550564 @xcite .",
    "the origin of this tail is probably due to comptonization by nonthermal electrons .",
    "we then present the /asm lightcurve of this object , and obtain its profile folded over the orbital period .",
    "for the first time , we find distinct differences in its shape between the soft and hard states .",
    "this indicates some effects of the different x - ray emission on the surrounding absorbing medium causing the orbital modulation .",
    "last but not least , we fit the spectrum from an instrument with a medium energy resolution , the _ bepposax_/mecs .",
    "the spectrum , belonging to the hard state , shows a number of _ emission _ features , which we fit by a model of photoionized plasma .",
