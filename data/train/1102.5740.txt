    "the ads / cft duality @xcite relates quantum gravity on ads spacetime to a relativistic quantum field theory on the boundary of ads . while the canonical example of such duality is between type iib string theory on ads@xmath7 and four dimensional @xmath8 sym ,",
    "there are numerous generalizations in various dimensions with less symmetry and a richer spectrum .",
    "recently , it has been proposed to apply holography to problems in non - relativistic quantum field theory with applications to condensed matter physics .",
    "gravitational duals of non -relativistic field theories were first proposed @xcite by studying einstein theory coupled to massive vectors , however it is of some interest to embed such solutions in a uv finite theory such as string theory or m - theory",
    ". there has been significant progress made in this direction @xcite and , indeed , this is the motivation for our current work .",
    "we will however take a somewhat different approach and study non - relavistic solutions of @xmath0 gauged supergravity in four dimensions , which should be holographically dual to the vacua of three - dimensional , non - relativistic quantum field theories .",
    "we will study gravitational duals to two kinds of non - relativistic solution , those with lifshitz scaling @xcite t^z t ,  x^ix^i combined with spatial rotations and those with schrdinger scaling @xcite x_+^z x_+ ,  x_-^2-zx_- ,   x^ix^i combined with galilean boosts .",
    "it has been well established that , for many internal manifolds , ten or eleven - dimensional supergravity can be consistently truncated to an effective gauged supergravity in lower dimensions .",
    "the prototypical examples are the maximal gauged supergravities in four , five and seven dimensions @xcite , which are believed to be consistent truncations of iib or eleven - dimensional supergravity on the appropriate dimensional sphere . for seven dimensional gauged supergravity the consistency of this reduction has been proved @xcite .",
    "these truncations keep all the lightest fields of just a subset of the various kaluza - klein towers , and , when further truncated to a more manageable sector , have been used to extract precise results on holographic renormalization group flows @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that while the explicit lift of any given solution to these gauged supergravities to the higher dimensional theory is theoretically possible , it can be quite technically challenging and in some cases perhaps prohibitively so .",
    "another avenue by which one can construct gauged supergravity theories from string / m - theory is to use a set of fundamental forms on the internal manifold which possess a closed set of differential and algebraic relations @xcite .",
    "this results in a truncation which is not so much a restriction to the lightest modes but instead to a singlet sector under a certain symmetry group .",
    "the invariant sector of a coset reduction is a prime example , but more general geometric structures such as sasaki - einstein spaces and nearly kahler manifolds also lead to such reductions . if this set of fundamental forms is chosen judiciously , the spectrum is finite and typically these truncations include massive scalars and vector fields . for these consistent truncations , the lift to",
    "the higher dimensional theory is trivial since by construction the mapping is provided .",
    "thanks to these impressive works on consistent truncations , we have the confidence to explore the parameter space of gauged supergravity in general and , then , to separately address the question of which subset of parameters admits an embedding into string / m - theory .",
    "we are not aware of a proof that any particular gauged supergravity can not be embedded into string / m - theory , nor do we have any reason to suspect this may be true .",
    "it should be noted that while consistent truncations are useful for computing supersymmetric solutions , for non - supersymmetric solutions however , one must be wary of instabilities which lie outside the consistent truncation @xcite and accounting for these can re - introduce many of the complexities which had been truncated away .    in this paper , we discuss the conditions for supersymmetry for lifshitz and schrdinger vacua in a general @xmath9 gauged supergravity with vectors and hypermultiplets and we then apply the formalism to a specific example .",
    "we will work with the canonical example of four dimensional @xmath0 gauged supergravity , namely we will retain just a single vector multiplet and a single hypermultiplet .",
    "the virtue of this approach is that by fixing the field content of the gauged supergravity but allowing for a quite general gauging , we can simultaneously scan infinite families of string / m - theory compactifications .",
    "we find that while the conditions for supersymmetry produce vacua which are isolated in field space , they place extremely mild constraints on the charges and in this sense the vacua we find are somewhat universal .    specifically , our scalar moduli space is _ sk _ q = , and we have two vector fields , the graviphoton and one from the vector multiplet .",
    "we gauge two commuting isometries of the hypermultiplet moduli space allowing for both electric and magnetic charges , in the sense discussed in section two .",
    "the type of vacua we find in any given theory depends crucially on whether the scalars are gauged electrically or magnetically , but depends only very mildly on the strength of the gaugings .",
    "we can gauge both compact and non compact isometries of the hypermultiplet scalar manifold .",
    "we have found no interesting supersymmetric non - relativistic solutions in the case with two non - compact gaugings .",
    "we discuss in details the two cases of a pair of compact gauging , or one compact and one non - compact .",
    "interestingly our results are essentially identical in both cases , indicating there is most likely a symmetry principle at work .",
    "specifically , when all gaugings are either electric or magnetic , we find supersymmetric lifshitz solutions with scaling parameter @xmath10 and we find that there are no supersymmetric schrdinger or @xmath11 ads solutions .",
    "these results indicate possible obstacles to constructing supersymmetric holographic rg - flows ( along the line of @xcite ) between ads and lifshitz spacetimes .",
    "on the other hand when the gaugings are a mixture of electric and magnetic , we find schrdinger solutions and @xmath0 ads solutions but no lifshitz solutions .",
    "we show that under mild conditions , we can associate a supersymmetric schrdinger solution to each @xmath9 ads@xmath12 vacuum . the value of @xmath13 in the schrdinger solution is related to the mass ( @xmath14 ) of the massive vector field in the corresponding ads@xmath12 vacuum by @xmath15 , as in the original construction in @xcite .    for a few particular gaugings , these solutions",
    "have in fact been found before and in those cases we find precise agreement .",
    "in particular we find the @xmath16 invariant @xmath0 ads@xmath12 vacuum of @xcite and we also reproduce the schrdinger solution found in @xcite .",
    "the lifshitz solutions with @xmath10 found in @xcite are also probably related to our class of solutions .",
    "most if not all possible gaugings can be viewed as arising from a consistent truncation of string / m - theory , and , in those cases , by the very nature of consistent truncations , any solutions of our gauged supergravity can be claimed to be solutions of string / m - theory .",
    "but we leave a detailed analysis of this issue for further work .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section two , we review some standard facts about four dimensional , @xmath0 gauged supergravity , largely to establish notation .",
    "in section three we study lifshitz solutions , deriving and solving the conditions for supersymmetry . in section four",
    "we repeat this analysis for schrdinger solutions and @xmath0 ads solutions . in section five",
    "we discuss the lift of these gauged supergravity theories to string / m - theory .",
    "in the rest of the paper we will work in the framework @xmath0 gauged supergravity in four dimensions . we refer to @xcite for a detailed description of the formalism .",
    "the fields of @xmath0 supergravity are arranged into one graviton multiplet , @xmath17 vector multiplets and @xmath18 hyper - multiplets .",
    "the graviton multiplet contains the metric , the graviphoton , @xmath19 and an @xmath20 doublet of gravitinos of opposite chirality , ( @xmath21 ) , where @xmath22 is an @xmath20 index .",
    "the vector multiplets consist of a vector , @xmath23 , two spin 1/2 of opposite chirality , transforming as an @xmath20 doublet , ( @xmath24 ) , and one complex scalar @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath22 is the @xmath20 index , while @xmath26 and @xmath27 run on the number of vector multiplets @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "the scalar fields @xmath25 parametrise a special khler manifold of complex dimension @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",

    "such gaugings appear naturally in some dimensional reduction of type iia theory on coset and nearly khler manifolds and provide examples of @xmath99 ads vacua @xcite .",
