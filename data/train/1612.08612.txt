    "they are characterized by nondegenerate , linearly dispersing ( weyl ) cones in their low - energy dispersion , where the weyl cones come in pairs of opposite chirality @xmath0 separated in momentum space .",
    "it can easily be shown that the weyl nodes act as monopoles of berry curvature , carrying a berry flux @xmath1 .",
    "the stability of the wsm phase is guaranteed by the conservation of the total berry flux . as a consequence",
    ", a weyl node can be gapped out only by merging it with a weyl node of opposite chirality .",

    "the surface of a wsm also exhibits interesting physics in that it supports surface states  @xcite , which are closely related to the topological nature of this phase .",
    "when the chemical potential is tuned to the weyl nodes , the bulk fermi surface is solely given by pairs of weyl points , which are connected by fas of chiral surface states .",
    "the study of interacting states with non - trivial topology  @xcite is currently one of the most active research areas in condensed matter physics .",
