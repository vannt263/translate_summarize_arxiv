    "the recent measurement of the @xmath2 baryon masses @xcite provides us with a rare opportunity to better our understanding of the interaction between a heavy quark and a light diquark at low energies . in this paper",
    "we study the dynamics of such a baryon by comparing its properties with those of a meson which has similar quark content .",
    "we focus on their color hyperfine splitting ( hf ) , which is defined as the mass difference between 2 similar hadrons that differ by one unit of spin ( e.g. @xmath3 ) . according to the available experimental data , the ratio between the hf splitting of a @xmath4 meson and that of a @xmath5 baryon ( where @xmath6 stands for @xmath7 , @xmath8 or @xmath9 ) is almost independent of the heavy quark flavor : @xmath10 this quantity was first discussed in @xcite , but so far we have not been able to explain this result from first principles . however",
    ", when using phenomenological models this ratio takes on a new meaning",
    " it will be shown below that within the constituent quark model , this ratio is equal to the ratio of contact probabilities between quarks inside the hadron .",
    "for example : @xmath11    the interesting feature of this quantity is that it is determined by two parameters only : the shape of the potential that binds the quarks together , and the quark mass ratio .",
    "while the constituent quark masses can be extracted with sufficient accuracy from relations between other hadron masses @xcite , the shape of the potential is still under continuing research .",
    "this subject was studied in the past mainly through the analysis of the quarkonium spectrum and the results favored a coulomb + linear potential @xcite , but this result still awaits a solid theoretical justification .",
    "we therefore suggest to use this ratio as a new means to test the possible quark confinement models .",
    "we computed the ratio of contact probabilities assuming various phenomenological models : harmonic oscillator , coulomb interaction , linear potential , logarithmic potential and the cornell potential ( linear+coulomb ) , and compared the different results with the available data for the hf splitting ratio .",
    "low - energy constituent - quark models have been surprisingly successful in predicting hadron masses @xcite . in such models",
    "the hadrons are considered as bound states of constituent quarks in a confining potential , and their total mass is given by the sakharov - zeldovich formula @xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the constituent quark mass and @xmath14 is the color hyperfine ( hf ) interaction between the quarks @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the hf interaction is described as the product of the magnetic moments of the quarks , in analogy with the electromagnetic hyperfine interaction , and is given by the expression : @xmath17 where @xmath18 are the @xmath19 generators , @xmath13 and @xmath20 are the mass and spin of the @xmath15th quark , @xmath21 is the distance between the quarks @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and @xmath22 is the coupling constant ( e.g. , in the case of one - gluon exchange between quarks and anti - quarks we have @xmath23 ) .",
    "we note that this is a contact interaction and that the formula is correct for s - wave hadrons only .",
    "we also assume that the same formula and parameterization apply for both mesons and baryons .",
    "we begin by demonstrating calculations with which constituent quark masses can be extracted from the hadron spectrum .",
    "the first example is the extraction of quark mass differences from @xmath24 baryon masses : @xmath25 where we used the fact that the hf interaction between the heavy quark and the light quarks must be zero , due to the anti - symmetry of the @xmath24 baryons under exchange of the light quarks .",
    "we can also use the expression for the meson hf splittings and @xmath26 @xmath27 to extract the ratio between the @xmath7-quark and @xmath8-quark masses : @xmath28 where we implicitly assumed that the interaction strength @xmath22 is equal in both cases and that the contact term does not vary greatly .",
    "given the simple form of this model , and the fact that we simply ignored the dependence on the contact probabilities , the consistency of the predictions given by this approach is surprising .",
    "the following values for the constituent quark masses can be extracted from these calculations @xcite : @xmath29      we now turn to quantities that involve both mesons and baryons , where the contact probabilities are no longer expected to be similar .",
    "we choose to analyze the ratio between two hf splitting values @xmath30 , because as will be seen below , some cancellations occur that simplify the final expression .",
    "the @xmath0 meson hf splitting is given by ( [ formula_k_hf ] ) .",
    "the calculation of the hf splitting of the @xmath1 baryon is easy because it gets no contribution from the @xmath31 diquark .",
    "the explanation for that is as follows : the total spin of the @xmath32 is @xmath33 , so all the quark pairs must be at relative spin 1 .",
    "the @xmath1 has isospin-1 , therefore the 2 light quarks must also have relative spin 1 , and the contribution of the @xmath31 diquark to the hf splitting is zero .",
    "we are left only with the interaction between the light quarks and the heavy one .",
    "after some spin products calculations we get the following expression for the @xmath1 hf splitting : @xmath34_{baryon } \\label{formula_sigma_hf}\\ ] ]    combining equations ( [ formula_k_hf ] ) , ( [ formula_sigma_hf ] ) and ( [ formula_su3_generators ] ) , and the relation : @xmath35_{meson}=2[\\vec{\\lambda_i}\\cdot{\\vec{\\lambda_j}}]_{baryon } \\label{formula_su3_generators}\\ ] ] we reach the result mentioned above : @xmath36 the advantage of this expression over relations such as ( [ formula_mass_ratio ] ) ( besides the fact that we do nt assume anything about the wave function ) , is that here we have the same quark content in all the interactions involved , and it seems safer to assume that interaction parameters ( confinement strength , hf interaction coupling constant ) are identical and therefore can cancel out in the ratio .",
    "similar expression are obtained when the @xmath7 quark is replaced with @xmath8 or @xmath9 quarks .",
    "the available experimental data is given in table [ tab_data ] :    [ !",
    "htbp ]    . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this research we tried to explain the measured ratio between the hf splittings of mesons and baryons using the constituent quark model .",
    "thanks to the simple fact that the @xmath1 baryon is an isospin-1 particle with quark content similar to that of a @xmath0 meson , most of the degrees of freedom in the sakharov - zeldovich model are eliminated , and the hf splitting ratio was shown to depend only on the quarks contact probabilities .    assuming different confining potentials we calculated the expected values for this measurement using variational methods .",
    "the software that implements these calculations reproduced similar calculations found in the literature with a deviation less than 1% .",
    "the results , which are summarized in fig . [ fig : conclusions ] , show that this quantity enables us to distinguish between the different confinement models , and that the experimental data favor a cornell potential , similarly to the results obtained by previous experiments .",
    "i would like to thank marek karliner , harry lipkin and jon rosner for encouragement and valuable discussions .",
