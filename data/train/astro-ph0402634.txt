    "early x - ray imaging observations with the _ einstein _ observatory and _ rosat _ showed that in the central regions of clusters of galaxies the radiative cooling time is shorter than the age of the universe ( e.g canizares , stewart , & fabian 1983 ) . as a result ,",
    "the intracluster medium ( icm ) should cool down to form a cold ( @xmath6k ) gas phase inducing a global inflow of gas .",
    "this `` cooling flow '' ( see fabian 1994 for a review ) picture has been extensively discussed and formed a basic assumption in many arguments .",
    "the low resolution spectroscopy in 0.5 - 2 kev by _ rosat _ showed that in some clusters the icm temperature actually decreases towards the center ( e.g. bhringer et al .",
    "1994 ; david et al .",
    "1994 ; allen & fabian 1994 ) .",
    "higher resolution spectroscopy in 0.5 - 10 kev with _ asca _",
    ", however , can not be fully understood with the conventional cooling flow model .",
    "_ asca _ spectra of cooling flow clusters can be well explained by a two ( hot and cool ) phase plasma without significant excess absorption features ( e.g. ikebe et al .",
    "1999 ; makishima et al .",
    "a naive cooling flow model predicting a range of temperatures with intrinsic absorption could also fit the _ asca _ data but generally produce worse chi - square results ( e.g. allen et al .",
    "most recently , very high resolution spectroscopy with xmm - newton / rgs unambiguously show that there is very little x - ray emission from gas cooler than certain lower cut - off temperatures of @xmath7  kev ( tamura et al . 2001 ; kaastra et al .",
    "2001 ; peterson et al .",
    "2001 ) . unless a large amount of cooled gas or the metals in the cold gas are hidden ( fabian et al .",
    "2001a ) , there must exist a heating mechanism that prevents the icm from radiative cooling .",
    "the necessity of global heat input into the icm in addition to gravitational heating has also been pointed out from the break of the self - similarity between dark matter and icm , which is most clearly demonstrated in the x - ray luminosity - temperature relation ( @xmath8 relation ) . a simple scaling analysis ( kaiser 1986 )",
    "suggests a relation of @xmath9 , while observation shows @xmath10 ( e.g. edge & stewart 1991 ; david et al .",
    "1993 ; white et al .",
    "1997 ; wu et al .",
    "the break of the self - similarity is also seen in the entropy vs temperature relation .",
    "ponman , cannon , & navarro ( 1999 ) showed that cooler systems ( @xmath11 kev ) have entropies higher than achievable through gravitational collapse alone .",
    "simulation studies show that the observed relations can be reproduced , if there is enough non - gravitational heat input into the icm by feedback from galaxies ( e.g. metzler & evrard 1994 ; bower et al .",
    "2001 ) or preheating before the cluster formation ( e.g. navarro et al . 1995 ; tozzi & norman 2000 ) .    in order to shed some new light onto these `` cooling flow phenomena '' and `` break of self similarity '' , we , in the present paper , perform a comparison of the temperature distribution of the icm to the distribution of the velocity dispersion of the dark matter .",
    "a parameter , @xmath12 , is often used as a measure of the average kinetic energy per unit mass in galaxies relative to that in the icm . from observations of many clusters ,",
    "the mean @xmath3 is @xmath13 with large scatter ( e.g. wu et al . 1999 ) , indicating that the energy equipartition between galaxies and icm is roughly achieved on average . in analogy with @xmath3",
    ", we can introduce @xmath14 for comparison between the mean kinetic energy of the dark matter and that of the icm , and define the dark matter `` temperature '' as @xmath15 .",
    "note that the above definition of `` temperature '' , by means of proton mass instead of the actual mass of dark matter particles , is only for the sake of comparison with the gas temperature .",
    "therefore we put `` temperature '' in quotes .",
    "we obtain , in this paper , the radial profile of the @xmath2 value observationally for the first time .    in sect .",
    "2 , we describe the method of measuring the dark matter velocity dispersion in a cluster of galaxies from an x - ray observation .",
    "we applied the method to the xmm - newton data of a prototypical cooling flow cluster , abell  1795 ( hereafter a1795 ) , which is located at z=0.0616 ( struble & rood 1987 ) .",
    "the x - ray data analysis and results are presented in sect .",
    "3 . discussion and summary are found in sect . 4 and sect .",
    "5 , respectively . throughout the paper , the hubble constant",
    "is given as 70 @xmath16 km s@xmath17 mpc@xmath17 , and a flat universe ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) is assumed .",
    "at the redshift of a1795 , 1 arcsec corresponds to 1.19 kpc .",
    "we use a simplified model cluster being composed of a hot plasma icm with a temperature of @xmath20  k , and dark matter made of collisionless particles . under the assumptions of spherical symmetry and hydrostatic equilibrium ,",
    "the icm distribution is described by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the total gravitating mass within a sphere of radius @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath25 is the gravitational constant , @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the density and temperature of the icm , respectively . from an x - ray observation , @xmath26 and @xmath27",
    "are measured and @xmath22 can be obtained via eq .",
    "( [ eq : hydro ] ) .",
    "when the dark matter particles tracing the same gravitational field are in steady state , they obey the jeans equation @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the one - dimensional radial velocity dispersion , and @xmath30 is the mass density , which is given as @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , once the total gravitating mass , @xmath32 , and the gas density , @xmath33 , profiles are obtained from an x - ray observation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : jeans ] ) contains only one unknown parameter , @xmath29 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : jeans ] ) can be rewritten in the form of an ordinary differential equation for @xmath34 as @xmath35 which can be solved numerically under a given boundary condition to derive the velocity dispersion profile of the dark matter .",
    "although a steady state dark matter distribution is assumed above , a dark matter density profile should actually be growing as matter is falling onto the system from outside .",
    "a numerical simulation by fukushige & makino ( 2001 ) shows that the dark matter halo grows in a self - similar way , keeping the density profile in the central region unchanged .",
    "this justifies the assumption at least in the central region .",
    "a similar technique as described above was used in determining the icm temperature profile , using x - ray imaging data without spectroscopic information taken e.g. with the _ einstein _ observatory .",
    "a model profile for the total mass is assumed and the temperature profile is derived from the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium so that the observed brightness profile is explained ( e.g. fabian et al .",
    "1981 ; hughes 1989 ) . here",
    "we solve the jeans equation instead in order to derive the dark matter velocity dispersion .",
    "an ideal opportunity to study the mass profile as well as velocity dispersion profile of dark matter is provided by the xmm - newton observation of a prototypical cooling flow cluster , a1795 .",
    "early x - ray imaging observations with the _ einstein _ observatory and _ rosat _ showed that the x - ray emission from a1795 has almost circular symmetry with a small elongation along the north - south direction , which indicates that the cluster is well relaxed dynamically ( jones & forman 1984 ; boute & tsai 1996 ) .",
    "the radial brightness profile shows a huge central excess above a prediction from an isothermal @xmath36-model profile , and the central excess luminosity gives a mass deposition rate of @xmath37 m@xmath38 yr@xmath17 based on the standard cooling flow interpretation ( edge et al .",

    ", we analyze the data taken with the xmm - newton / epic pn , mos1 and mos2 to measure the total mass profile of a1795 and to derive the dark matter velocity dispersion profile using the method described in sect .",
    "a significant fraction of any xmm - newton observation is often contaminated by the huge background count rate by soft proton flares . in order to derive time intervals with stable background",
    ", we made the 0.510 kev band lightcurves individually with the pn , mos1 , and mos2 data , and eliminated time periods where the count rate deviates from the mean value during quiescent periods by @xmath46 .",
    "the total usable exposure time thus left is 23 ksec , 31 ksec , and 34 ksec for pn , mos 1 and mos 2 , respectively . in the present analysis ,",
    "the single and double pixel events of the pn data and the single , double , triple , and quadruple events of the mos data are used .",
    "the background consisting of the cosmic x - ray background and the high energy particle events was estimated from the lockman hole data taken during the revolution # 70 . in this sky region ,",
    "the galactic column density is as low as the a1795 field . after eliminating the contamination sources from the lockman hole data as well as the a1795 data ,",
    "the lockman hole data are scaled so that the count rates of the background and the cluster data becomes the same in the 7 - 12 kev energy band , and in the radius range of 575 - 925 arcsec for pn and of 500 - 850 arcsec for mos , where no significant x - ray signal from the cluster was detected .",
    "the background data thus obtained were subtracted from the cluster data . for pn , the out - of - time events ( strder et al .",
    "2001 ) were also subtracted prior to the subtraction of the background .      defining the center as the x - ray peak position , we have produced a projected radial brightness profile in the 0.8 - 10 kev band .",
    "the x - ray count rate was converted to the x - ray flux by correcting each x - ray photon with the instruments responses that include the effective area and vignetting of the x - ray telescopes , and the quantum efficiency of the ccd cameras . combining the data taken with pn , mos1 and mos2 , we thus derived the brightness profile , which is illustrated in fig .",

    "has long been known to show a central excess above a @xmath36-model profile , we employed here a double @xmath36-model profile that is the sum of two @xmath36-model profiles to fit the 0.8 - 10 kev brightness profile within 848 arcsec . in the actual fitting",

    "we derive here the temperature and metallicity profiles instead in 3-dimensional form from deprojected spectra . with each pn , mos1 , and mos2 data set ,",

    "assuming spherical symmetry and that there is no cluster emission beyond 848 arcsec from the cluster center , we deprojected the annular spectra to spectra for 13 spherical shell regions whose radii correspond to the annular radii . since no intrinsic absorption is found even from the central region ( tamura et al .",
    "2001 ) , the x - ray emission from the cluster is entirely optically thin , and we performed the deprojection process as follows .",
    "the relation between the energy spectra observed in the @xmath52 annular regions , @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) , and those emitted from the @xmath52 shell regions , @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) , is given with a matrix relation as @xmath57 where @xmath58 in the present case .",

    "thus derived from each pn , mos1 , and mos2 data set , we used only the inner 10 deprojected spectra within a 512 arcsec radius in the analysis below so that the artificial cut - off of the x - ray emission outside the maximum radius of 848 arcsec does not affect the resulting deprojected spectra within 512 arcsec .",
    "in addition , the signal to noise ratios of the spectra within 512 arcsec are high enough , and some 10% systematic error of the predicted background count rates introduce no significant systematic errors on temperature measurements .    in order to derive the temperature and metallicity profile , we simultaneously fitted the pn , mos1 , and mos2 spectra with a single - temperature plasma model in each deprojected shell region .",
    "we employed the mekal model ( mewe et al .",
    "1985 , 1986 ; kaastra 1992 ; liedahl et al . 1995 ) and assumed the abundance ratio among different elements to have solar values .",

    "[ sigma_dm ] individually for different mass models applied .",
    "the errors on the icm temperature profile are properly taken into account to obtain the error bands . in the central region , there is a clear difference between the results from the double approximated king model and the nfw model as expected from their different behavior .",
    "the velocity dispersion is then converted to the `` temperature '' of the dark matter ( @xmath118 ) , which is compared with the icm temperature in fig .",
    "[ dm_tpro ] . the icm temperature is greater than the dark matter `` temperature '' everywhere . even in the central region",
    "where radiative cooling is expected to be most effective , the icm temperature is significantly higher than that of the dark matter .",
    "the comparison of the temperatures can be more directly described by means of the @xmath2 value defined as @xmath119 , which ranges @xmath430.3 - 0.8 ( fig .",
    "[ beta_pro ] ) .",
    "there is no sign that the icm is cooled significantly below the dark matter `` temperature '' . in other words ,",
    "the dark matter looks to form the temperature floor that limits the icm temperature .    as a matter of fact ,",
    "what we derived by solving the jeans equation is the velocity dispersion of the collisionless particles that includes the dark matter as well as the stellar component . as shown in fig .",
    "[ masspro ] , the stellar component makes a minor contribution to the total mass and the derived velocity dispersion profile shown in fig .",
    "[ dm_tpro ] is virtually that of the dark matter , except in the very central region , where the two components are comparable . if the galaxies alone are in a steady state , they should also obey the jeans equation under the same gravitational potential . in fig .",
    "[ dm_tpro ] , we overlay the velocity dispersion profile of the member galaxies measured by den hartog and katgert ( 1996 ) , and the stellar velocity dispersion of the cd galaxy provided by blakeslee and tonry ( 1992 ) , after converted to `` temperature '' via @xmath120 .",
    "they show roughly a consistent profile with that of the dark matter at least in the case when the total mass profile is given by the nfw model .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : jeans ] ) that we have used to calculate the dark matter velocity dispersion profile is based on the assumption of isotropic motion of dark matter particles .",
    "however , simulation studies ( e.g. eke , navarro , and frenk 1998 ; coln , klypin , & kravtsov 2000 ) indicate that the radial velocity dispersion , @xmath121 , should be rather larger than the tangential velocity dispersion , @xmath122 .",
    "the degree of anisotropy is often measured with @xmath123 and the jeans equation is modified as @xmath124    employing @xmath125 derived by coln , klypin , & kravtsov ( 2000 ) , which is as large as 0.5 at the virial radius , @xmath106 , and converging to 0 at the center , we solved eq .",
    "[ eq : jeans2 ] as done in sect .",
    "the @xmath0 profile thus derived for the case of the best fit nfw mass profile is shown in fig .",
    "[ sigma_dm2 ] , overlaid with the @xmath126 solution given in fig .  [ sigma_dm ] .",
    "the @xmath127 value with the anisotropy is greater than that without the anisotropy by only @xmath436% at 100kpc and at most @xmath4340% around 1mpc .",
    "the @xmath2 profile determined here from observations should provide information on the thermal history of the icm . from numerical simulation studies ,",
    "@xmath128 is expected , if there is no cooling or additional heating ( e.g. metzler and evrard 1994 ; navarro et al .",
    "1995 ; bryan & norman 1998 ) .",
    "an obvious way to explain the @xmath2 value smaller than unity in a1795 is heating of the icm .",
    "as suggested from the break of the self - similarity between dark matter and icm , there should have been non - gravitational heating acting globally .",
    "we , from our results , estimated the excess energy of the icm over that of the dark matter particles as @xmath129 where @xmath130 denotes mass weighted mean within radius , @xmath23 .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ mean_de_pro ] , the excess energy , @xmath131 , thus derived is found to be @xmath7 kev per particle , which may be compared with theoretical model predictions .",
    "the amount of energy injection to the gas phase that explains e.g. the observed @xmath8 relation depends on the period when the heating occurred .",
    "heating prior to cluster collapse , `` preheating '' , needs @xmath132  kev per particle ( e.g. navarro et al . 1995 ; tozzi & norman 2001 ) , while heating after a cluster formation requires higher values of @xmath133  kev per particle ( e.g. metzler & evrard 1994 ; loewenstein 2000 ; wu , fabian , & nulsen 2000 ; bower et al .",
    "our results given above may indicate that the global non - gravitational heating that may cause the break of self similarity has happened mainly within a collapsed cluster .",
    "however , even if such non - gravitational heating that explains the global x - ray feature of the cluster is provided , the central region of a1795 has a short radiative cooling time ( fig .",
    "[ coolt ] ) , and there must be another significant energy input to the icm in the central region at the present epoch to prevent the icm from cooling .    as a possible energy source in the central region ,",
    "we first consider gravitational energy of the member galaxies and stellar components therein .",
    "the kinetic energy of the random motion of stars can be partially transferred to the icm by stellar mass loss .",
    "gas supplied by stellar mass loss has velocities of the bulk motions of stars relative to the icm , which is the sum of a galaxy motion and the motions of the stars in the galaxy , and is likely to be thermalized by interactions with the ambient gas . if the stellar component moving in the same gravitational potential has a similar velocity dispersion profile as that of the dark matter ( fig .",
    "[ dm_tpro ] ) , the gas temperature achieved from this process is expected to be comparable to the velocity dispersion of the dark matter .",
    "this process nicely accounts for x - ray emission from isolated x - ray compact elliptical galaxies ( matsushita 2001 )",
    ". the input rate of the kinetic energy of the gas from stellar mass loss may be simply estimated as @xmath134 = @xmath135 ergs / s , where @xmath136 is the total stellar mass of @xmath137 m@xmath38 , @xmath138=@xmath139 m@xmath38 yr@xmath17 ( @xmath140m@xmath38)@xmath17 is the stellar mass loss rate in unit time , and @xmath141(=580@xmath14280 km / s ) is the velocity dispersion of the galaxies from den hartog & katgert ( 1996 ; fig .",
    "[ dm_tpro ] ) .",
    "( the stellar velocity dispersions in the galaxies are smaller and neglected here . )",
    "this is much smaller than the output energy in the central region by x - ray radiation in galaxy clusters like a1795 , however .",
    "thus for the case of galaxy clusters , we have to look for additional heat sources .",
    "kinetic energy of the stellar component might be more efficiently transferred to icm via magnetic fields . as pointed out by e.g. makishima et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , the motion of stars may amplify interstellar magnetic fields and reconnections of the fields may heat up the icm rather efficiently .",
    "the galaxies must have lost their kinetic energies through interactions with the icm and have gradually fallen inwards accumulating onto the central galaxy to form the cd galaxy . a deep optical image of the cd galaxy in a1795 derived by johnstone et al .",
    "( 1991 ) shows a concentration of elliptical galaxies of various sizes and stars forming a largely extended envelope with 131 @xmath143  kpc effective radius , which strongly suggests the on - going formation process of the cd galaxy .",
    "quantitatively , the total amount of dynamical energy of the stellar component in the member galaxies that has been lost in the past is estimated . the stellar component in the galaxies",
    "is assumed to have a negligible small potential ( @xmath144 ) and kinetic energy ( @xmath145 ) before the formation of the cluster , and the current energy of the stars is estimated to be @xmath146 ergs .",
    "if the energy has been released over the last 10 gyr and has been spent in icm heating , the heating luminosity is expected to be @xmath147 ergs s@xmath17 .",
    "this amounts to the bolometric luminosity of the icm within 60@xmath143  kpc ( fig .",
    "[ coolt ] ) , and may be sufficient to sustain the thermal energy of the icm against radiative cooling .",
    "this model predicts that the stellar velocity dispersion became smaller than that of icm , i.e. @xmath148 , which is consistent with the actual observed value in the central region ( fig .",
    "[ dm_tpro ] ) .",
    "alternatively , there may be sufficient non - gravitational heat input from an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) powered by an accretion of low entropy gas at a cluster center ( churazov et al .",
    "2002 ; bhringer et al . 2002 ) .",
    "numerical simulations show that an outflow from an agn may form hot bubbles of relativistic plasma rising with buoyancy , and the bubbles may uplift cold gas mixing with ambient icm ( churazov et al .",
    "2001 ; quilis , bower , & balogh 2001 ; brggen & kaiser 2002 ; basson & alexander 2003 ) .",
    "high resolution imaging observations revealed ripples and shock features in the central region of perseus cluster ( fabian et al .",
    "2003 ) and m87 ( forman et al .",
    "2004 ) , suggesting that the bubble energy may also be transfered by sound wave to larger distances , and that shocks may be the major contribution of the energy dissipation .",
    "the heating mechanism is self regulated : the lower the entropy , the higher the accretion rate onto the central engine . a portion of the accretion power is dissipated back into the icm to make its entropy high and regulate the accretion rate to achieve an equilibrium state .",
    "this process automatically prevents the persistence of cold and hence dense clouds .",
    "the cd galaxy of a1795 has a radio source , 4c26.42 , and the existence of an agn is evident . using the physical state of the icm in the center we can actually estimate the energy provided by the agn by applying the bondi accretion model .",
    "according to the well - known correlation of the black hole mass with the mass of the bulge component ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) , the black hole mass is expected to be @xmath149 m@xmath38 .",
    "assuming that the gas profile is flat in the center , we can use the measured values of @xmath33=0.1 @xmath150 and @xmath68=2.8 kev to obtain the bondi mass accretion rate @xmath151 where @xmath152 and @xmath153 are the density and sound velocity outside the bondi accretion radius .",
    "we find @xmath154 . under the standard assumption of 10% of the accretion energy to be dissipated ,",
    "the output energy is found to be @xmath155 ergs / s .",
    "this amounts to the x - ray luminosity within the inner @xmath156 kpc region only .",
    "the bondi accretion radius is estimated to be @xmath157 30 pc , much smaller than the resolution of the temperature and density structure that can be measured with xmm - newton .",
    "if the icm density is not uniform but is clumpy , the bondi accretion rate should be significantly larger and the heating rate could also be larger than the above estimation .",
    "we can note that the icm conditions might temporally vary and that we currently see a relatively low state .",
    "note that there are other heating mechanisms discussed , which include e.g. a classical idea of thermal conduction from the hot outer regions ( e.g. takahara & takahara 1979 ; tucker & rosner 1983 ; bregman , & david 1988 ; gaetz 1989 ) , and the acoustic wave heating recently proposed by fujita , suzuki , & wada ( 2004 ) .",
    "comparison of those model predictions with our results presented in the current paper would be very interesting .",
    "we derived the dark matter velocity dispersion profile from an x - ray observation for the first time . using the xmm - newton epic data of a1795 , we derived @xmath2 of @xmath158 , indicating that the icm temperature is larger than the dark matter `` temperature '' everywhere .",
    "we also derived the excess energy in the icm , @xmath131 , which is found to be @xmath5  kev per particle .",
    "these observational quantity should be useful to provide a new clue to solve the heating mechanism in the cooling core and to understand the thermal history of a galaxy cluster .",
