    "this shows that large telescopes are very efficient at surveying , especially with the advent of multi - pixel feeds @xcite .",
    "however , fast imaging with interferometers consisting of small dishes synthesizes of order hundreds of beams simultaneously ; this compensates for their small effective area and gives a competitive survey speed at fast sampling rates .",
    "for example , a 42-dish fast - imaging system at the ata would have a survey speed a few hundred times higher than a 19-beam phased array feed at the green bank telescope .",
    "these improvements come with the challenge of much greater signal processing in the digital domain and massive data volumes .",

    "compute clusters will help meet this demand , especially since the search consists of millions of processes that can be run independently .",
