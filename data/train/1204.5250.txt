    "<S> motivated by the very recent measurements performed at the lhcb and the tevatron of the @xmath0 mixing , in this paper we revisit it in a family non - universal @xmath1 model , to check if a simultaneous explanation for all the mixing observables , especially for the like - sign dimuon charge asymmetry observed by the d0 collaboration , could be made in such a specific model . in the first scenario where the @xmath2 boson contributes only to the off - diagonal element @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> , it is found that , once the combined constraints from @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are imposed , the model could not explain the measured flavour - specific cp asymmetry @xmath7 , at least within its @xmath8 ranges . in the second scenario where the np contributes also to the absorptive part @xmath9 via tree - level @xmath2-induced @xmath10 operators </S>",
    "<S> , we find that , with the constraints from @xmath4 , @xmath5 and the indirect cp asymmetry in @xmath11 taken into account , the present measured @xmath8 experimental ranges for @xmath7 could not be reproduced too . thus , such a specific @xmath2 model with our specific assumptions could not simultaneously reconcile all the present data on @xmath0 mixing . </S>",
    "<S> future improved measurements from the lhcb and the proposed superb experiments , especially of the flavour - specific cp asymmetries , are expected to shed light on the issue . </S>"
