    "<S> high - pressure infrared transmission measurements on 60 were performed up to 9 gpa over a broad frequency range ( 200 - 20000 @xmath0 ) to monitor the vibrational and electronic / vibronic excitations under pressure . </S>",
    "<S> the four fundamental t@xmath1 modes of 60aare split into doublets already at the lowest applied pressure and harden with increasing pressure . </S>",
    "<S> several cation modes and fullerene - related modes split into doublets at around 2  gpa , the most prominent one being the g@xmath1 mode . </S>",
    "<S> the splitting of the vibrational modes can be attributed to the transition from the dynamic to static jahn - teller effect , caused by steric crowding at high pressure . </S>",
    "<S> four absorption bands are observed in the nir - vis frequency range . </S>",
    "<S> they are discussed in terms of transitions between lumo electronic states in 60a , which are split because of the jahn - teller distortion and can be coupled with vibrational modes . </S>",
    "<S> various distortions and the corresponding symmetry lowering are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> the observed redshift of the absorption bands indicates that the splitting of the lumo electronic states is reduced upon pressure application . </S>"
