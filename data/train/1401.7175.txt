    "in contrast to the gaussian distribution , the general stable lvy distribution can be asymmetric and , in the limiting cases , assume a stretched exponential tail . in particular , the distribution may be restricted to a half - axis .",
    "specifically the asymmetric processes , where the asymmetry is measured by a skewness parameter @xmath2 , emerge in many problems and are frequently discussed in the literature .",
    "a complicated picture of the anomalous diffusion in the reaction - diffusion systems is due to asymmetric lvy flights and the right - moving fronts accelerate exponentially .",
    "they develop an algebraic tail , while the left - moving fronts have exponential decaying tails and move at a constant speed @xcite .",
    "a fractional advection - dispersion equation with any degree of skewness in several dimensions was analysed in @xcite , whereas the problem of the diffusion in the porous media , which display a fractal structure , was studied by a stochastic equation driven by the asymmetric lvy process in @xcite .",

    "strongly asymmetric lvy flights were observed in cracking of heterogeneous materials @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated in the field of finance that prices of the derivatives satisfy a fractional partial differential equation corresponding to the asymmetric lvy processes @xcite . in the framework of the jumping processes , a diffusion equation , fractional both in space and time and corresponding to a master equation for the random walk with the asymmetric lvy distribution ,",
    "was discussed in @xcite ; the appropriate algorithms were derived in order to numerically simulate the time - evolution .",
    "dynamical descriptions of materials containing impurities and defects must take into account random quantities which actually do not evolve with time if the time - scale of the impurities diffusion is much larger than that of the measured variable ( a quenched disorder ) .",
    "this introduces a correlation between the successive trapping times ; the trapping time at a given site is the same for each visit of this site @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the hopping rates are position - dependent : the jump probability function in a random walk description has a coupled form and the corresponding langevin equation possesses a multiplicative noise . usually , the langevin equation with the additive noise is studied and , in such approaches , the medium nonhomogeneity is actually reduced to a homogeneous distribution of the noise activation times @xcite .",

    "the accelerated diffusion , in turn , emerges when variance is infinite , due to the long jumps .",
    "studies of the langevin equation with the multiplicative lvy noise @xcite for the symmetric case demonstrate that physical conclusions qualitatively depend on a particular interpretation of the stochastic integral .",
    "the dynamics in the stratonovich interpretation may be characterised by a finite variance , even in the absence of any potential , and then the solution exhibits fast falling power - law tails and a subdiffusive behaviour .",

    ", we consider a general , asymmetric case and demonstrate , in particular , how the asymmetry parameter influences the anomalous transport .",
    "we begin with the continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) theory , well - known for the lvy flights , but usually restricted to homogeneous distributions of the waiting time .",
    "ctrw is defined in terms of the two distributions : the waiting - time distribution @xmath3 and the jump - length distribution @xmath4 .",
    "usually , one assumes that they are independent stochastic variables ( the decoupled version of ctrw ) and the resulting process appears non - markovian , except the case of the poissonian @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath3 has long tails and @xmath4 is the gaussian , the fokker - planck equation , which emerges from the master equation in the limit of small wave numbers , is fractional in time @xcite .",
    "then the trapping times hamper the transport and one observes the subdiffusion .",
    "when , on the other hand , @xmath4 obeys the general lvy statistics with @xmath5 , the variance is infinite .",
    "we consider the markovian case and assume , in contrast to the usual approach , that the jumping rate depends on the process value : @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the markovian property implies a poissonian form , @xmath7 and by introducing the variable @xmath8 we take into account that the waiting time depends on the medium structure .",
    "the process is defined by an infinitesimal stationary transition probability , @xmath9 the particle remains at rest for a time sampled from @xmath3 after which instantaneously jumps to a new position and then the process is stepwise constant .",
    "the first term on the right - hand side of eq.([trkp ] ) is the probability that no jump occurred in the time interval @xmath10 and the term @xmath11 means the probability that one jump occurred .",

    "there is no general method to exactly solve the fractional equation with a variable diffusion coefficient .",
    "however , since the equation itself was derived by applying the condition ( [ dl ] ) , we may restrict our considerations to the limit @xmath32 without introducing any additional idealisation .",

    "can be directly inferred from the fractional equation ( [ fracek ] ) .",
    "eq.([fracek ] ) can be solved also for @xmath47 and for that purpose the @xmath34-function coefficients must be modified similarly to the symmetric case @xcite . however , then we would leave a domain of the stable distributions .",
    "asymptotic shape of the solution indicates that all moments of the order @xmath48 diverge and the transport properties may be quantified by fractional moments .",
    "the existing fractional moments , corresponding to the solution ( [ solp ] ) , are given by the mellin transform from the @xmath34-function , @xmath49= -\\frac{2\\sigma(t)^{\\delta/\\alpha}}{\\pi\\alpha}\\gamma(-\\delta/\\alpha)\\gamma(1+\\delta ) \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi\\delta}{2}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\beta\\delta}{2\\alpha}\\pi\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath50 denotes the mellin transform corresponding to @xmath51 , and @xmath52 ; therefore , @xmath53 .",

    "the divergence of the variance may be unphysical if one considers the motion of a massive particle though this property does not violate physical principles for such problems as the diffusion in energy space in spectroscopy or for the diffusion on a polymer chain in the chemical space @xcite .",
    "to get rid of the difficulty of divergent moments one introduces the lvy walk @xcite which relates the jump length to the velocity .",
    "it is possible to generalise the above model by introducing a dependence of the velocity variance on time ; then one obtains a strong anomalous diffusion and the scaling relations different from those for the ordinary lvy walk @xcite .",
    "one the other hand , one can argue that every system is finite and introduce a truncation of the distribution in a form of a fast - falling tail .",

    "shape of the probability distributions can be determined experimentally and such studies , applied to the heterogeneous systems , could reveal effects of the variable diffusion coefficient . from that point of view , the analysis of fractures of the disordered materials and measuring the crack propagation is promising since in those systems complex processes proceed on a broad range of scales and exhibit self - similar properties . a recent study @xcite demonstrates that the experimental distribution of the local velocities of the crack front is characterised by a power - law tail , @xmath138 , and the global velocity distribution converges by upscaling to the asymmetric stable distribution for scales larger than the spatial correlation length . at smaller scales , in turn , only the tail agrees with the stable distribution which conclusion may indicate , in view of our results , the it interpretation of eq.([la ] ) and presence of the strong nonhomogeneity ( @xmath139 relatively large ) .",
    "the analysis presented in this paper shows namely that @xmath73 can converge to the stable distribution only if @xmath8 is sufficiently smooth ; otherwise , @xmath73 still possesses a fat tail corresponding to the stable distribution but behaviour near @xmath76 may depend on @xmath54 @xcite . a characteristic feature of systems governed by eq.([la ] )",
    "( @xmath107 ) is a specific time - dependence of the fractional moments , similar for both interpretations , which can both decrease and increase the transport speed , compared to the homogeneous case .",
    "this property appears robust in respect to the nonhomogeneity parameter @xmath54 and has been observed not only for the stable solutions ( [ solp ] ) @xcite .",
    "it has been argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that the experimentally estimated variance of the global crack front velocity assumes a finite value since the system is actually finite .",
    "it would be interesting to verify whether that quantity , measured for a small resolution to make the self - similar structure apparent , obey eq.([mom ] ) .",
    "we will show that the function ( [ solp ] ) satisfies eq.([fracek ] ) to the lowest order in @xmath40 and evaluate @xmath39 .",
    "first , the fourier transform from both @xmath73 and @xmath140 is needed . since for any stable density @xmath141",
    ", we only consider @xmath142 .",
    "then we have , @xmath143dx\\ ] ] and @xmath144 .",
    "the cosine transform from the @xmath34-function is given by the general formula : @xmath145\\cos(kx)dx=   \\frac{\\pi}{k}h_{q+1,p+2}^{n+1,m}\\left[k\\left|\\begin{array}{l } ( 1-b_q , b_q),(1,1/2)\\\\ \\\\ ( 1,1),(1-a_p , a_p),(1,1/2 ) \\end{array}\\right.\\right ] .",

    "then we take the fourier transform from eq.([a.4 ] ) ; the existence of @xmath149 requires that the singularity at @xmath76 must not be essential which , in turn , implies the condition @xmath150 .",
    "next , we expand all the functions in eq.([a.1 ] ) , for @xmath151 and @xmath152 , in powers of @xmath40 by applying the general formula , @xmath153=\\sum_{h=1}^m\\sum_{\\nu=0}^\\infty\\frac{\\prod_{j=1,j\\ne h}^m\\gamma(b_j - b_j\\frac{b_h+\\nu}{b_h})\\prod_{j=1}^n\\gamma(1-a_j+a_j\\frac{b_h+\\nu } { b_h})}{\\prod_{j = m+1}^q\\gamma(1-b_j+b_j\\frac{b_h+\\nu}{b_h})\\prod_{j = n+1}^p \\gamma(a_j - a_j\\frac{b_h+\\nu}{b_h})}\\frac{(-1)^\\nu z^{(b_h+\\nu)/b_h}}{\\nu!b_h } ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is valid if @xmath74 and @xmath154 ; the latter condition is satisfied for the case @xmath30 .",
    "evaluating the first two terms in ( [ a.1 ] ) , corresponding to the l.h.s .",
    "of eq.([fracek ] ) , yields @xmath155 where the coefficient @xmath156 corresponds to the term @xmath157 and @xmath158 in eq.([a.5 ] ) .",
    "a similar calculation for the imaginary part yields @xmath159    to evaluate the r.h.s of eq.([fracek ] ) up to the required order , it is sufficient to determine the term @xmath160 which is real .",
    "the simplest method makes use of the mellin transform , namely : @xmath161= \\frac{2\\sigma^{-\\theta/\\alpha}}{\\pi}\\gamma(1-\\theta)\\gamma(\\theta/\\alpha)\\sin(\\pi\\theta/2)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\beta\\theta}{2\\alpha}\\pi\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath50 denotes the mellin transform corresponding to @xmath51 . since , asymptotically , @xmath162 , the convergence of the integral in eq.([a.9 ] ) imposes the condition @xmath90 . introducing the above results to eq.([fracek ] )",
    "produces two identical equations for the real and imaginary parts which determine the function @xmath39 , @xmath163 and its solution with the initial condition @xmath164 is given by eq.([sodt ] ) .",

    "a similar reduction applies to the case @xmath31 and the result , similar to eq.([b.2 ] ) , represents an expansion for small arguments @xcite .",
