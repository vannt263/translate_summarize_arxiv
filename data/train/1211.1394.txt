    "the first generation of stars , so - called population iii stars ( pop iii ) , form from pristine gas within dark matter halos ( ) at very high redshifts @xcite . both one - zone calculations and cosmological simulations suggest a top - heavy pop iii  imf  with an uncertain characteristic mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the uncertainty hinges on recent simulations that showed the fragmentation and multiplicity may occur at protostellar densities  @xcite , and on the idea that protostellar radiative feedback may limit mass accretion to @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "massive pop iii  stellar lifetimes are @xmath4 2 - 20 myr , after which they either enrich the intergalactic medium ( igm ) with metals through supernovae  @xcite or collapse directly into black holes ( ) that could grow into the supermassive ones at galactic centers  @xcite . while the pop iii  imf  is still uncertain , it is likely that do host pop iii  stars , and a significant fraction produce seed .    to form the first generation of stars , primordial gas collapses within the center via two separate cooling channels  molecular hydrogen and atomic hydrogen .",
    "@xcite found the minimum mass to form cold dense core through molecular hydrogen cooling :    @xmath5    where @xmath6 relates to the lyman - werner flux , @xmath7 .",
    "it is this flux that is responsible for photo - dissociating molecular hydrogen . to calculate @xmath8",
    ", we adopt the comoving lyman - werner photon density , @xmath9 , from @xcite , which assumes stellar photon yields from @xcite :    @xmath10    and    @xmath11    for @xmath12 at @xmath13 , @xmath14 .   by an order of magnitude  @xcite ; this should not affect our results since we are concerned with the _ difference _ between two otherwise identical volumes . ]    on the other hand , all with virial temperatures @xmath15  k trigger efficient atomic hydrogen cooling , independent of the lyman - werner background .",
    "a virial temperature of @xmath16  k translates into a mass of : @xmath17    regardless of the cooling mechanism , the that host the first generation of stars are by far the most massive structures at this early epoch .",
    "for example , a of @xmath18 is a @xmath19 peak at @xmath20 .",
    "these rare and massive peaks are the first collapsing structures in the universe , and are the most likely to be plagued by numerical transients and initial value issues in any cosmological simulation .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to compare the effect on the pop iiiera of two different techniques for initializing a cosmological @xmath1-body simulation : the zeldovich approximation ( ) , and second order lagrangian perturbation theory ( ) on the pop iiiera .",
    "below , we merely outline the cosmological initialization techniques ; see @xcite for a comprehensive overview .",
    "the particle positions in an @xmath1-body simulation are generated from a density spectrum consistent with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "since @xmath1-body simulations start at much lower redshifts ( @xmath21 ) , the particle evolution up to the starting redshift is estimated using a displacement field . in the zeldovich approximation ,",
    "the displacement field assumes a linear evolution from recombination to @xmath22 so the particle displacement is determined by the linear overdensity and linear growth factor @xmath23 . in , the displacement field also includes a second order growth factor @xmath24 and accounts for some of the non - linear density evolution .",
    "since is accurate only to first order , any higher order growing modes will be incorrect . in addition , in the non - linear decaying modes , called transients , damp away with @xmath25 , while in , transients damp much more quickly , as @xmath26 .",
    "this implies that the collapse time of true structures in an @xmath1-body simulation will be accurate after fewer e - folding times when using  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , for same starting redshift , simulations initialized with will capture the formation of very high redshift halos more accurately compared to simulations initialized with .",
    "in general , high - sigma peaks are supressed in , and the effect is larger at high redshift . of course ,",
    "given enough expansion factors , the transients eventually damp out for all but the most massive .",
    "the standard lore is that a simulation must only start earlier than ; indeed , by @xmath27 there is only a @xmath28 difference in the number density above @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "this small difference in the _",
    "present day _",
    "mass function is perhaps why the zeldovich approximation has been adopted so widely .",
    "in any cosmological simulation , the goal is to displace the particles only slightly from their initial positions .",
    "the rms displacement , @xmath30 is : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the fundamental mode , @xmath33 is the simulation box - size , @xmath34 is the nyquist frequency for an @xmath35 simulation , and @xmath36 is the power spectrum at the starting redshift , @xmath22 .",
    "if @xmath30 is larger than the mean interparticle separation @xmath37 , then `` orbit crossing '' occurs and invalidates the accuracy of the initial conditions . strictly speaking , imposing",
    "@xmath38 would be ideal in that it makes orbit crossing a @xmath4 10-sigma event .",
    "the challenge in small volume , high resolution simulations is that @xmath39 is small and the starting redshift must be very high to satisfy this @xmath40 constraint .",
    "for instance , to satisfy @xmath41 , a 10 @xmath42 mpc , 512@xmath43 simulation would need @xmath44 .",
    "however , at very high redshifts the matter distribution is quite smooth , and the net force may be dominated by numerical round - off errors  @xcite  this will suppress small scale structure .",
    "therefore , we adopt @xmath45 , which sets @xmath46 .",
    "we note that this criterion is rarely mentioned in the literature .",
    "several small volume , high resolution simulations appear to have @xmath47 , a clear sign that the initial conditions are not valid .",
    "since canonical pop iii - hosting halos are expected to appear at @xmath48 , this @xmath22 allows 10 expansion factors to occur , which reduces transients from the initial conditions in by a factor of 100 .",
    "we initialize six 512@xmath43 , 10 @xmath42 mpc , dark matter - only cosmological volumes of a @xmath49cdm universe and evolved them with gadget-2  @xcite from @xmath46 to @xmath2 .",
    "the six simulations directly contrast the initialization technique , because each pair samples the volume identically from the cmb transfer function , and only displaces these identical initial positions to the same starting redshift using either or .",
    "each volume is initialized using wmap-5 parameters  @xcite .",
    "given that we are concerned with the evolution of our volumes at very high redshift , care was taken to integrate the positions and velocities with high accuracy .",
    "we adopted many of the tree code parameters of the coyote universe  @xcite .",
    "pmgrid , which defines the fourier grid is 1024 , asmth , which defines the split between long and short - range forces , is @xmath50 times the mesh cell size , rcut , which controls the maximum radius for short - range forces , is @xmath51 times the mesh cell size , the force accuracy is @xmath52 , the integration accuracy is @xmath53 and the softening is @xmath54 kpc .",
    "the particle mass for all simulations is @xmath55 .      in post - processing , we identified halos with at least 20 particles using subfind  @xcite and constructed a halo mergertree  @xcite .",
    "we seeded @xmath56 in halos with the mass criteria defined in the previous section .",
    "once a seed is sown , we do not allow another to form within that halo .",
    "the merger tree now allows us to track the growth and merger of as well .",
    "we assumed a simple growth prescription : eddington - limited accretion triggered by a major merger , where the merge promptly after merge , and there is no gravitational wave recoil  ( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) .",
    "while the imfof pop iiistars and growth are still a matter of debate , the goal in this paper is simply to examine the differences between and -seeded volumes .",
    "a different imfor growth prescription will change absolute number densities and masses , and more ( or less ) aggressive growth will result in a difference in the ionized volumes . hence , we chose the simplest pop iii  imfand growth prescription to contrast the two initialization techniques .         computed by combining all three boxes for the and initialized volumes .",
    "the most massive black holes in the simulation volumes , @xmath57 , are _ consistently _ more likely in the volumes by roughly 40% . ]    once the are seeded and accreting , we estimate the ionizing photon luminosity from the growing , as well as its effect on the neutral gas in the neighborhood through radiative transfer calculations .",
    "we assume that the is fed at the eddington rate by major mergers , and this presupposes a rich supply of cold gas in these halos  an assumption that has not been observationally verified at such a high redshift .",
    "in fact , massive first stars can expel most of the gas in the host halo , starving the remnant  @xcite until a merger with a gas - rich can restock it .",
    "in particular , early simulations with @xmath58 pop iii  stars found that gas expulsion delayed accretion for 1050 myr while the host restocked its gas reservoir  @xcite .",
    "recent simulations predict lower pop iii  stellar masses , and their radiative feedback can still drive the majority of gas out of their host halos . however , most of the gas infall at high redshifts and in rare peaks happen through cold streams  these cold streams present a small solid - angle to the stellar photon flux , which should make it more difficult to photo - evaporate .",
    "thus , it may be plausible for pop iii , especially in more massive ones suppressed by lw radiation , to retain a reservoir of gas for future consumption .",
    "our simulation is collisionless , so we calculate the impact of enhanced growth on the neutral gas numerically in post - processing . for an accreting ,",
    "the temperature profile of the accretion disk is : @xmath59 where , @xmath60 is mass , @xmath61 is gas accretion rate , @xmath62 is stefan - boltzmann s constant , @xmath63 is the innermost accretion disk radius .",
    "the accretion disk luminosity at a given frequency , @xmath64 , can then be computed : @xmath65^{-1 } r { { \\rm { d}}}r\\ ] ] where @xmath66 is the emitted luminosity per frequency band , @xmath67 is the speed of light , @xmath68 is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath69 is planck s constant .",
    "the accretion efficiency , @xmath70 converts the accreted mass @xmath71 to energy : @xmath72 , where @xmath73 . for a schwarzschild @xmath63",
    "is @xmath74 with @xmath75 . in practice , we used @xmath76 and adjusted @xmath63 accordingly .    to quantify the effect of these on reionization , we conduct radiative transfer calculations with enzo+moray  @xcite .",
    "after every snapshot , we accumulate a fraction @xmath77 of the mass into a fixed 512@xmath43 grid , assuming all gas is hydrogen . at these scales and resolution",
    ", the gas should follow the dm .",
    "the density distribution is fixed during the radiative transfer calculation .",
    "we treat each accreting as a point source , with luminosities described by equation ( [ eqn : lnu ] ) divided into bins of @xmath78 ev .",
    "photon packages have the average photon energy in each bin , @xmath4 28 , 70 , 400 , and 1200 ev , and they obey periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we use a nonequilibrium chemistry model @xcite with hydrogen only .",
    "we consider compton cooling and free electron heating by the cmb , radiative losses from atomic cooling in the optically thin limit , and secondary ionizations from high - energy radiation , using the fitting formulae from @xcite .",
    "by @xmath2 , we find that the -initialized volume produces 25more pop iiistars than the identical volume .",
    "this is synonymous with saying that high mass collapsed earlier and more often .",
    "indeed , at @xmath79 , there are 3 times the number of above @xmath80 , roughly a 5-@xmath62 peak , and by @xmath20 , the difference in the halo mass function above @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) is @xmath83 .",
    "note that at @xmath2 , the difference in the number of _ newly formed _",
    "pop iiistar hosting halos has virtually vanished ",
    "this suggests that the simulation has undergone enough e - folding times to damp away transients .",
    "an overall 25% increase in the number of pop iii - hosting halos may not sound huge , but the consequences of this early and generous sowing of pop iiistars on proto - supermassive growth is more profound .",
    "when we grow seed bhs with the major - merger driven prescription outlined above , the minor difference in the halo mass function magnifies . figure  [ fig : blackholes ] shows the mass density , @xmath84 , as a function of redshift .",
    "we calculate a factor of @xmath4 2 difference in @xmath84 by @xmath2 .",
    "if we allow a very vigorous , and perhaps unrealistic , growth scheme that fuels the continuously at the eddington rate , then @xmath85 would be more than 10 times larger than the approximation .",
    "future space - based gravitational wave observatories may detect these inspirals ; the gravitational wave signal in this pre - reionization era could feature more numerous and louder sources than predicted , depending on the detector configuration .      perhaps the most interesting consequence of the mass function is the effect of the more numerous and more massive on reionization .",
    "figure  [ fig : blackholes_mf ] shows the probability density of the mass function at @xmath2 over all and initialized volumes .",
    "we find that massive black holes ( @xmath86 ) are @xmath87 times more common in volumes .",
    "although our simulation is purely collisionless , we can estimate the contribution from the first on reionization .",
    "by @xmath2 , we find that emit 75% more ionizing photons per hydrogen atom than .",
    "this alone implies that the ionization history will be dramatically different .",
    "we next present the results from three - dimensional radiative transfer calculations on these six volumes .",
    "figure [ fig : compare ] shows the evolution of the total luminosity and mass - weighted electron fraction in the and simulations in one realization . at @xmath88 ,",
    "the total luminosity fluctuates but is roughly equivalent .",
    "afterwards , the total luminosity in the simulation is consistently @xmath89 times greater than .",
    "this results in a larger ionized fraction at @xmath90 , and yields a total ionized fraction of 0.16 and 0.25 for and at @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "however , this enhanced contribution to reionization only translates to a change in the thomson optical depth of @xmath91 , if the universe is completely ionized at @xmath92 . in the other two realizations , the ionized fraction increases by 0.12 and 0.09 at @xmath2 .",
    "the density - weighted projections of electron fraction in figure [ fig : reion ] depicts the spatial differences between and at three redshifts .",
    "the regions around the bhs are generally larger and more abundant in the case .",
    "overall , the ionized volume is @xmath93 times larger , where we define ionized as @xmath94 .",
    "furthermore , this additional luminosity globally warms the igmoutside these to 17,000 k in underdense regions ( @xmath95 ) , compared to 14,000 k in .",
    "this igm global warming by pre - reionization may be important in regulating the formation and growth of later , lower mass  @xcite .",
    "we found that pre - reionization simulations are particularly sensitive to the phase - space initialization method , given that the astrophysically interesting  ones that host the first stars , , and protogalaxies  are all expected to collapse at very high redshifts .",
    "this means that the transient errors in the initial positions and velocities have only a few e - folding times to damp away before we need to make reliable measurements of the collapsed .",
    "we found that the zeldovich approximation underestimated the number and mass of the high mass during the dark ages , and this @xmath96 difference in the extreme end of the halo mass function magnified , increasing the mass density @xmath97 times for @xmath98 at @xmath2 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : blackholes_mf ] ) .",
    "this difference depends both on the fact that seed bhs form earlier , which allows them to grow for a longer time through mergers and accretion , and also that they are sown more often .",
    "one of the largest effects of this more accurate technique is apparent in the reionization history of the early universe .",
    "the volume of the universe reionized at @xmath2 more than doubles , _ only _ due to the initialization method .",
    "we caution that our main goal was to study differences in our two testbed simulations using simple prescriptions for feedback and mass accretion .",
    "we neglect cold gas inflows , mechanical feedback , and indeed all gas and reionization physics is treated in post - processing .",
    "we are also neglecting a potentially critical effect of dark matter streaming motions on baryons at @xmath99 , which will also delay galaxy formation compared to a standard approach  @xcite . while the actual reionized volume of universe is not robust here , the critical point is that both and press - schechter approaches underestimate the volume merely because they both assume a linear evolution of dm overdensities .",
    "we focused on pop iii - star hosting halos here , simply because the predicted mass thresholds are easily defined .",
    "however , a -initialized simulation will always underestimate the very high end of the mass function during the pre - reionization era , and this will have an effect on any prediction that relies on accurate high mass number counts  an obvious example is seed formation from direct collapse  @xcite .",
    "note , too , that our simulation is @xmath100 times too small to model billion solar mass , whose number density is 1 per gpc@xmath43  @xcite . although wmap-5 can constrain the number of @xmath101 halos , our volume is too small to sample these halos .",
    "we do predict that these even rarer peaks will be more numerous and will be , on average , more massive in the pre - reionization epoch than predicted by n - body simulations initialized with . in principle , observations will be able to constrain the true halo mass function in the dark ages . while the relatively small difference in @xmath102 we observed may not be distinguishable with planck and herschel  @xcite , the global igm temperature difference may be detectable  @xcite , and ska could easily probe this difference in the 21 cm power spectrum  @xcite .",
