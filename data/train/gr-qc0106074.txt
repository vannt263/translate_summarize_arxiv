    "the inflationary universe scenario has become an integral part of the standard model of universe .",
    "it does resolve the outstanding problems of the standard model like the flatness problem , the horizon problem , the homogeneity and isotropy problem etc .",
    "it also provides an important clue for the origin of structure formation in the universe [ 1,2 , 3 ] .",
    "the underlying idea of inflation is that there was an epoch when the universe was slowly rolling down the flat wings of the scalar potential such that vacuum energy was dominant leading to the exponential growth of the scale factor . at the end of slow roll",
    ", the universe falls into the core of the potential and fast oscillates near the minimum leading to the re - heating ultimately .",
    "damour and mukhanov have discussed the possibility of inflation during the period of oscillations [ 4 ] .",
    "further discussion on the same theme can be found in reference [ 5 ] .",
    "in fact , such a possibility was first pointed out by turner [ 6 ] .",
    "inflation with oscillation can be realized by a non - convex potential @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) with small convex core near the minimum of the potential and with large flat wings such that universe spends most of the time away from the core and inflates . in this paper",
    "we study general aspects of inflation during oscillations .",
    "we derive general expression for the number of e - folds which reduce to the standard formula in the slow role regime and leads to the damour - mukhanov type expression for slowly varying adiabatic index .",
    "we apply our result to the logarithmic potential and show that the model exhibits simple analytical solution which has remarkable agreement with the numerical simulation .",
    "the field evolution equations in the freedman cosmology have the form @xmath3",
    "@xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 where @xmath7 @xmath8 equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) are not independent of ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) but will be useful in view of forthcoming discussion . equation ( 3 ) reveals that the energy density in scalar field @xmath9 decreases because of the red shifting away of the kinetic part @xmath10 . in what follows",
    ", we shall assume that the potential is even and has minimum at @xmath11 .",
    "when the field initially being displaced from the minimum of the potential , rolls below its slow roll value , the coherence oscillation regime @xmath12 commences .",
    "the evolution equation can then be approximately solved by separating the two times scales namely the fast oscillation time scale and the longer expansion time scale . on the first time scale ,",
    "the hubble expansion can be neglected , and one obtain @xmath9 as a function of time ; @xmath13 where @xmath14 ; @xmath15 being the maximum current value of the potential energy and @xmath16 being the field amplitude . on the longer time scale @xmath17 and @xmath16 slowly decrease because hubble damping term in equation ( 1 ) .the average adiabatic index @xmath18 is defined as , @xmath19 where@xmath20 denotes the time average over one oscillation .",
    "equation ( 4 ) then tells that expansion during oscillations would continue ( @xmath21 if @xmath22 the adiabatic evolution of @xmath23 and @xmath17 is given by , @xmath24 @xmath25 as @xmath26,the condition @xmath27 can equivalently be written [ 6 ] , @xmath28 @xmath29 it is suggestive to write ( 11 ) in an equivalent form , @xmath30 the expression ( 12 ) has a simple geometric meaning ; the average over one oscillation of the intercept u(@xmath9 ) at @xmath9 should be positive to ensure accelerated expansion . in models of inflation with oscillation the slow roll value of the field @xmath31",
    "is `` far away '' from convex core given by @xmath32 such that@xmath33 is positive before @xmath9 rolls below certain critical value of the field @xmath34 fig.1 . as a result",
    "the universe undergoes accelerated expansion ( @xmath35 this is because the average of intercept @xmath36 is negative for @xmath37 and the positive contribution to @xmath38 starts coming only as @xmath9 gets bigger than @xmath39 .",
    "obviously one has to take @xmath40 further to some @xmath41 in order to cancel the negative contribution to @xmath38 coming from the convex core . in certain sense",
    "the @xmath34 defines the effective size of convex core . clearly , as @xmath9 rolls below @xmath34 , the average of @xmath36 over one oscillation turns negative and",
    "consequently inflation ceases loosing to oscillations without accelerated expansion .",
    "hence for inflation to occur during oscillations , the field amplitude @xmath16 should very between @xmath34 and @xmath42",
    ". we shall call this regime `` oscillatory inflation regime '' .",
    "we shall study here the logarithmic potential which may implement inflation with oscillations , @xmath43\\ ] ] this is the q tending to zero limit of the potential suggested by damour and mukhanov , @xmath44\\ ] ] the potential has a convex core near the bottom of potential given by @xmath45 whereas @xmath46 is negative away from the core . for @xmath47 , @xmath48 and consequently @xmath49      in order to compute the size of inflation , it would be necessary to determine @xmath50 : @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 in case of the potential given by ( 13 ) .",
    "since only the sigh of @xmath55 is important we have omitted several positive constants in the expression ( 15 ) .",
    "the average intercept @xmath55 is plotted in fig . 2 in case of the logarithmic potential under consideration .the value of @xmath56 where @xmath55 changes sign precisely determines the critical value of the field or equivalently @xmath57.for the logarithmic potential @xmath57 turns out to be nearly equal to 3.2 .",
    "the slow roll parameter @xmath58 is defined as : @xmath59 ^ 2\\ ] ] the slow roll ends when @xmath60 using ( 16 ) yields the slow roll value of the field @xmath61 , @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath42 depends upon @xmath45 .it should be emphasized that @xmath64 or equivalently @xmath42 would always depend upon @xmath45 in case of non - power law potentials .",
    "the number of e - folds is defined by , @xmath65 since the scale factor `` a '' depends upon @xmath16 or equivalently upon @xmath66 ( 18 ) should be used carefully .",
    "we divide the interval [ @xmath67 into small slices , @xmath68with @xmath69 such that @xmath70 and @xmath71the number of e - foldings obtained for the interval @xmath72 is given by , @xmath73 where @xmath74 for universe rolling down from @xmath75 using ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) leads to the following expression , @xmath76 expanding @xmath77 in teller series in the neighborhood of @xmath78 and using @xmath79 for @xmath80 we get , @xmath81 integrating ( 19 ) from @xmath57 to @xmath64 one obtains the total number of e - foldings , @xmath82 where @xmath83 @xmath84 can be interpreted as the density of e - foldings with regard to @xmath56 . the correct definition , however , should take into account the change in the comoving hubble length [ 7 ] , @xmath85 similar arguments as above can be used to obtain the expression for@xmath86 , @xmath87 where @xmath88 expression ( 22 ) formally written for oscillatory regime presents a general result for the number e - foldings . in fact , in slow roll approximation , @xmath89 substituting this expression in ( 22 ) leads to the standard formula for the number of e - foldings [ 2 ] .needless to say that @xmath0 nearly coincides with @xmath90 in case of the slow role regime .in",
    "case @xmath18 is a slowly varying function of @xmath56 , @xmath86 assumes the following form , @xmath91\\ ] ] for a power law potential ( 23 ) readily reduces to the expression obtained by liddle and majumdar [ 6 ] .",
    "we will show that a simple and elegant analytical formula for the number of e - folding can be obtained in case of the logarithmic potential ( 13 ) . as mentioned earlier that @xmath92 in the present case [ 4,5 ] .substituting the approximate value of @xmath18 in ( 22 ) leads to a simple expression for @xmath93 , @xmath94 using ( 21 ) we obtain the formula for the total number of e - foldings , @xmath95 it should be mentioned that we have used the approximate value of @xmath18 to obtain the above expression for @xmath0.since the approximation holds good away from the core and little contribution to the number of e - foldings comes from the regions near the core",
    ", we would expect that the expression ( 25 ) gives the correct value of @xmath0.we have evolved the field equations numerically and studied the evolution of the number of e - foldings .",
    "fig2 displays the numerical evolution of @xmath86 for two different values of @xmath45.the dependence of @xmath64 on @xmath45 can in general be red off from ( 17 ) .the heights of maxima of @xmath0 are described by ( 25 ) .we see the remarkable agreement of our analytical result with the numerical simulation.as emphasized earlier [ 4 , 5 ] the number of e - foldings @xmath0 is small.even if @xmath45 is pushed to electro - weak scale @xmath0 does not exceed 10.one might think that brane world inflation would be helpful here as the brane corrections enhances the prospects of inflation [ 8 , 9 , 10 ] .",
    "unfortunately , this is not so as the brane induced term increases the hubble expansion rate which is not relevant during oscillations .",
    "we have described the general features of oscillatory inflation.we have been able to obtain a general expression for the number of e - foldings and demonstrated its consistency . applying the same to the logarithmic potential we obtained an elegant and simple analytical formula for the number of e-foldings.we evolve the field equations numerically and observe a remarkable agreement of the analytical result with the numerical simulation .",
