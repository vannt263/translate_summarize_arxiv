    "the modelling of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of galaxies and its interpretation in terms of stellar population parameters ( e.g. age , star formation history , metallicity ) via stellar population synthesis ( sps ) is a fundamental tool to understand the properties and evolution of galaxies .",
    "yet , we are far from a complete comprehension and a reliable modelling of some stellar evolutionary phases which strongly affect the energy output of stellar populations . among them , the so - called thermally pulsing - asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) phase has been the focus of debate among modellers for several years ( e.g. @xcite ) . this late stage of the agb phase for low and intermediate mass stars ( @xmath4 57 m@xmath5 ) culminates in stellar populations of ages between 0.5 and 1.5 gyr .",
    "tp - agb stars emit mainly in the near infrared ( nir ) spectral range given the low temperatures of these stars .",
    "quantitative predictions of the lifetimes , luminosities and spectral shapes and features of these stars as well as of their impact on the integrated spectra of even `` simple '' stellar populations , are still very uncertain and strongly model - dependent ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "one further complication derives from the fact that tp - agb stars are likely to be embedded in envelopes of dust produced by themselves ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which attenuates the emerging optical and nir radiation by a substantial fraction @xcite .    the seminal work of ( * ?",
    "* ma05 hereafter ) , who adopted the `` fuel consumption theorem '' approach and calibrated the flux contribution of this phase against optical and nir photometry of magellanic clouds globular clusters , dramatically pointed out how large the impact of tp - agb stars on galaxy seds may possibly be .",
    "the ma05 models make two clear and testable predictions in contrast to `` classical '' models ( such as * ? ? ?",
    "* bc03 hereafter ) , which rely on standard , less extreme prescriptions for the tp - agb phase : in particular , _",
    "i ) _ the nir flux of stellar populations of ages between @xmath60.5 and @xmath7 gyr is enhanced by a factor up to 3 ( as a function of age and metallicity ) ; in addition , _ ii ) _ strong , sharp absorption features appear in the spectrum , especially at nir wavelengths ( and most notably at 1.1 , 1.41 and 1.77  @xmath2 m ) .",
    "these features correspond to the band - heads of carbon composite molecules and should depend on metallicity .",
    "they represent the undebatable fingerprints of tp - agb stars as predicted by ma05 models .",
    "this can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ma05vsbc03 ] , where we confront the optical - nir spectra of simple stellar populations ( ssp ) of three ages ( 0.5 , 1 and 1.5 gyr ) at three different metallicities ( 0.5 , 1 and 22.5 @xmath8 ) as derived from the ma05 models ( black lines ) and the bc03 models ( red lines ) respectively .",
    "observationally , detections of near - infrared cn absorption bands have been reported in the integrated spectra of only a few seyfert galaxies @xcite and globular clusters dominated by the stochastic presence of bright carbon stars @xcite .",
    "in fact , from a theoretical point of view , carbon absorption features are not a required signature of agb - star populations .",
    "sophisticated models of agb stellar evolution predict that convective dredge - up of carbon produced by nuclear fusion during the envelope thermal pulses will increase the abundance of carbon relative to oxygen near the surface , which can eventually lead to the production of a carbon star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while the efficiency of this process is expected to increase as the metallicity decreases , the integrated spectrum of most intermediate - age stellar populations could well be dominated oxygen - rich agb stars without strong carbon absorption features .",
    "the largely different nir flux predictions for tp - agb stars by different models have strong implications in terms of sed interpretation , leading to substantially lower stellar mass and age estimates ( by up to a factor 2 or more ) when rest - frame nir bands are included in the analysis of galaxies with ages around 1 gyr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the popularity of nir passbands as tracers of stellar mass , both at low and high redshift , thanks to their ( generally ) low sensitivity to age , metallicity and dust in terms of mass - to - light ratio ( m / l ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , clearly calls for a proper assessment of the models in this respect ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "verifying the reliability of sps models in the regime of ages around 1 gyr is therefore of paramount relevance for studies of galaxy properties and their evolution .",
    "since 2005 , a number of contrasting results and claims have been produced about the appropriateness of the ma05 predictions .",
    "@xcite showed that the ma05 models fit the seds of high - z ( @xmath9 ) galaxies better than bc03 models .",
    "however the same work shows that the performance of the two models differ only marginally in terms of goodness of fit if one allows for dust reddening , although the inferred stellar mass is substantially different . a better agreement of ma05 models with the observed optical - nir colours is also reported by @xcite , who used combined optical spectroscopy and optical - nir photometry to constrain the star formation history of two galaxies .",
    "@xcite also report detections of the 1.77  @xmath2 m feature in two magellanic clouds globular clusters , in agreement with ma05 predictions .",
    "on the other hand , studies of magellanic clouds globular clusters found significant discrepancies between observations and ma05 predictions .",
    "@xcite found that the co line strength ( in the nir k band ) is much weaker than predicted by ma05 in clusters of age @xmath6 1 gyr .",
    "@xcite studied the colours of magellanic clouds globular clusters as a function of their age and showed that ma05 models predict optical and nir colours that are too red . moreover",
    "the predicted age dependence of these colours does not agree with the data .",
    "as opposed , a substantial agreement with models based on much less extreme tp - agb prescriptions is found .    as already pointed out by @xcite ,",
    "post - starburst galaxies ( psb hereafter ) are the best galaxies to look at in order to find the fingerprints of ( tp-)agb stars on their sed .",
    "psbs have a star formation history dominated by a burst in the exact age range when tp - agb stars are expected to have the strongest impact , i.e. between 0.5 and 1.5 gyr prior to the epoch of observation .",
    "their optical spectrum is characterised by a well developed balmer / d4000 break , the lack of strong emission lines ( which testify a substantial cessation of star formation activity ) and by the very strong balmer absorption lines typical of a stars ( hence the alternative denomination of e+a or k+a galaxies ) .",
    "@xcite compared the optical - nir colours of the sample of psbs spectroscopically selected by @xcite to the colours of different sps models .",
    "they showed ( see their fig .",
    "16 ) that @xmath10 , @xmath11 colours are not reproduced by ma05 models : not only would the blue portion of this colour plane be only explained by unrealistically low metallicities , but also the age sequences in ma05 models produce trends that are orthogonal to the observed age trends . @xcite",
    "performed another photometric test , in which they fitted the stacked ( rest - frame ) uv - optical - nir sed of 62 psbs at @xmath12 , colour selected from the _ newfirm _ medium band survey ( nmbs ) to have ages around 1 gyr , according to both bc03 and ma05 models .",
    "also in this case it is found that bc03 models can reproduce the observed seds much better , in particular the observed blue optical - nir colours , which are not reproduced by ma05 .    in this paper",
    "we present the results of the experiment that we designed to test for the two main predictions of ma05 models , namely the presence of sharp nir spectral features and the boosted nir flux , on a sample of psbs carefully selected from optical spectroscopy and newly observed in nir spectroscopy ( h and k band ) with isaac at the eso - vlt .",
    "the selection criteria and properties of the sample are fully detailed in section [ sec : sample_obs ] . here",
    "we would like to stress the uniqueness of this work . _",
    "i ) _ for the first time we cover both the optical and the nir range of psbs with flux calibrated spectra to look directly for the nir spectral features at 1.41 and 1.77  @xmath2 m predicted by the ma05 models and resulting from the large impact of tp - agb c - rich stars .",
    "these features are unaccessible or extremely difficult to measure from the ground as they roughly coincide with the atmospheric gaps between j and h , and between h and k bands , respectively , for nearby objects .",
    "therefore we observed psbs in the redshift range 0.150.25 so that the c - features move well into the observable windows and are minimally affected by uncertain telluric corrections , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ma05vsbc03 ] . _",
    "ii ) _ contrary to previous works based either on colour selection @xcite or on a purely phenomenological spectroscopic selection @xcite , the selection of our sample is based on both phenomenological criteria ( high balmer line strength and low emission lines , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and bayesian estimates of light weighted ages from optical spectral indices as in @xcite .",
    "this allows us to focus our observations and analysis on the _ precise _ range of stellar ages where tp - agb stars are expected to contribute the most , for a variety of stellar metallicities .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec : sample_obs ] we present the sample , the new isaac nir spectroscopic observations and the data reduction , including spectrophotometric calibrations and integration with optical data .",
    "in section [ sec : analysis ] we present the results and discuss possible spurious effects and contaminations that might affect our conclusions . a comparison with the analysis of @xcite is also presented .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : summary ] we summarise our findings and propose our conclusions and future developments .",

    "this selection is based on the sdss - dr7 casjobs catalog .",
    "we further restrict the sample by applying the visibility cuts in order for targets to be observable from paranal during the winter semester : dec@xmath20 deg and ra between 0 and 230 deg or ra@xmath21  deg .",
    "finally we require that the stellar light - weighted age of the galaxies is in the range 0.5 to 1.5 gyr , i.e. at the maximum of the predicted tp - agb luminosity contribution , based on the estimates computed as in @xcite and available in the mpa - jhu catalog .",
    "given the relative rarity of the post starburst phase and the restrictive age , coordinate and redshift cuts ( the latter particularly relevant as it is almost at the extreme boundary of the sdss main galaxy sample ) , the final sample is composed of sixteen galaxies only .",

    "we note that the estimates of the stellar population parameters of @xcite rely on the comparison with synthetic spectral libraries based on bc03 models , therefore they could be biased with respect to estimates based on other synthesis models , most notably the ma05 ones",
    ". however , optical spectral indices short - wards of 5500    are generally well agreed upon among different modellers and , most importantly , are only weakly affected by tp - agb stars , which mainly influence the nir spectral region .",
    "thus age and metallicity estimates from optical absorption features are robust against different tp - agb prescriptions and the use of different models .",

    "based on the sdss optical images and , to minor extent , on our isaac nir images , we note that the majority of galaxies display smooth and centrally concentrated light distributions , typical of early type galaxies , with the only exception of psbj0227@xmath400015 , which has an extended and irregular `` halo '' .",

    "the isaac instrument @xcite has been used in two different spectroscopic setups to obtain low resolution spectra in the h and k bands .",
    "1.5 arcsec slit and sws1-lr grism were used in both setups , with central wavelengths of 1.65 and 2.2  @xmath2 m respectively .",
    "this gives a spectral resolution of @xmath42 ( 50   ) and @xmath43 ( 70   ) in h and k respectively .",
    "observations were carried out in service mode with clear ( not necessarily photometric ) sky and maximum seeing of 1.4 arcsec to minimise slit losses and match the fibre size and seeing of the sdss optical spectra as well as possible .",
    "standard abba on - slit nodding with 70 arcsec offsets and 20 arcsec jittering were adopted to allow accurate sky subtraction and bad pixels and cosmic ray rejection .",
    "eight exposures of 180 sec each were taken in h band and six exposures of 150 sec each were taken in k , for total 24 minutes of integration in h and 15 minutes in k per target .",
    "this eventually yields typical signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of @xmath44 and 25 per resolution element in h and k respectively .",
    "spectro - photometric standard stars were observed with identical setup immediately after or before the science observations to provide a reliable estimate of the spectral sensitivity function and compute the corrections for telluric absorption .",
    "standard data reduction procedures have been implemented in iraf .",
    "wavelength calibration has been performed based on the sky oh lines as measured on a median combined image of the scientific frames .",
    "this approach turned out to be much more stable and reliable than using the arc lamp calibrations taken in day time .",
    "we have tried different approaches to optimally correct the spectra for telluric absorption . as our best solution we adopted the following strategy : the empirical high - resolution transmissivity function of the average atmosphere above paranal ( provided by eso ) is finely tweaked by scaling and changing the resolution until we can exactly compensate for the observed absorption at various wavelengths on the spectrum of the spectrophotometric standard ; the coadded spectrum of each galaxy",
    "is then corrected for the same absorption pattern as for the closest ( in time and airmass ) standard star .",
    "we have applied the telluric correction to both standard stars and galaxies _ before _ computing the sensitivity function and applying the flux calibration .    in order to assemble a sed including the visible range and the h and k nir bands , absolute flux calibration is required . to this goal",
    "we have obtained high snr images in @xmath45 and @xmath46 bands in photometric conditions with isaac as part of the same program .",
    "`` total '' integrated magnitude derived from these images are used to rescale the spectra . by `` total '' magnitude",

    "@xmath46 magnitudes are used to rescale the respective isaac spectra in the nir , while the optical spectrum from the sdss is normalised according to the @xmath29-band petrosian magnitude0205 and psbj0151@xmath400056 ) we find fainter magnitude by more than 0.03 mag ( + 0.040 and + 0.033 respectively ) .",
    "these small discrepancies are well within the errors adopted in sec .",
    "[ sec : sspcomp ] and [ sec : cspcomp ] . ] .",
    "conversions between nir magnitudes natively calibrated in the vega system for the isaac filters into the corresponding flux densities for our spectra are computed based on the spectrum of vega of @xcite , distributed by bc03 .",
    "typical total photometric uncertainties for isaac petrosian magnitudes are estimated @xmath47 mag and include photometric zero point fluctuations ( @xmath48 mag , derived from repeated observations of standard stars during the nights ) and background subtraction uncertainties . for the sdss",
    "we assume errors of 0.02 mag , which is the maximum reported for our objects by sdss - dr8 .",
    "foreground galactic extinction correction is finally applied using the optical depth derived from @xcite and assuming the standard extinction laws of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the spectra of our galaxies , both sdss and isaac , are taken in relatively small apertures or slits centred on the brightness peak : 3-arcsec",
    "fibres are used in the sdss with a typical seeing of @xmath49 arcsec while 1.5-arcsec long - slits with seeing of 1.4 arcsec or better are used with isaac . relative aperture size and seeing",
    "are designed to conspire and collect a similar fraction of the galaxy light . by rescaling the spectra according to the `` total '' petrosian magnitudes we implicitly assume that stellar population gradients are of limited relevance and the central region of the galaxies are representative of the whole . @xcite",
    "have analysed a small sample of post - starburst galaxies with integral field spectroscopy and showed that , in reality , a large fraction of them have cores that are younger than the rest of the galaxy , hence our assumption does not strictly hold . unfortunately , because of different seeing conditions and geometry of the apertures , a precise and homogeneous rescaling of the spectra is very hard to achieve . however ,",
    "by comparing fluxes and colours that are obtained in the petrosian and in the fibre apertures we can show that the aperture effects for our sample are small enough not to affect our conclusions .",
    "first of all , we note that at the relatively high redshift of our sample the apparent size of the galaxies is typically 2.5 arcsec ( median petrosian radius , maximum 3.1 arcsec ) , so that the 3-arcsec sdss fibre typically collects already half of the total flux .",
    "the isaac spectra roughly collect the same fraction of flux .",
    "the long slit geometry in this case integrates into the spectra not only the central part , but also the outskirts of the galaxy , so that the isaac spectra are indeed even more representative of the whole galaxy .    in second place ,",
    "we have checked by how much `` total '' petrosian colours differ from fibre colours in the optical .",
    "fibre colours are computed in such a way that they correspond as closely as possible to the sed portion effectively captured in the sdss spectra .",
    "the strongest effects are expected and observed in @xmath50 , since this colour roughly corresponds to @xmath51 at @xmath1 and therefore is the most sensitive to stellar population properties by bracketing the d4000 break .",
    "we find that , on average , fibre @xmath50 is bluer by 0.027 mag with respect to the corresponding total petrosian colours , with a rms of 0.037 .",
    "only four galaxies ( out of 16 ) have a fibre colour which is bluer than total by more than 0.05 mag : psbj1046@xmath410714 , psbj1015@xmath410103 , psbj0227@xmath400015 and psbj0328@xmath410045 .",
    "we dub these galaxies `` blue core '' in the following . for the remainder",
    ", differences in colour can be considered as not significant , although the data hint at starbursts preferentially occurring in the central regions of galaxies rather than in the outskirts , consistently with @xcite .",
    "looking at @xmath52 , which roughly corresponds to the rest - frame optical colour @xmath53 that will be discussed in the following , we find even smaller differences of 0.012 mag on average ( 0.021 mag rms ) .",
    "these are well within the spectrophotometric calibration errors .    finally , we estimate the relative aperture corrections between the optical and nir bands . specifically , we consider the aperture corrections in @xmath29 and @xmath45-band , defined by @xmath54 . for the @xmath29-band",
    "we use the quantities provided by the sdss database . for the @xmath45-band we use the total petrosian magnitude as derived above ,",
    "while to obtain fibre magnitudes we first convolve the isaac images to a common psf of fwhm@xmath552 arcsec and then integrate the flux within a circular aperture of 3 arcsecond in diameter , as done in the sdss pipeline . since for most of the isaac images we lack a sufficient number of high snr stars to compute an accurate psf ,",
    "the final fwhm is approximated within 0.1 arcsec .",
    "we find an average difference of aperture corrections in @xmath29 and @xmath45-band @xmath56 mag with rms of 0.1 mag , indicating that on average our galaxies are slightly more concentrated in @xmath29 than in @xmath45 , although with very marginal significance .",
    "this is consistent with the existence of few blue cores and , in general , of very small systematic sed variations between the spectral and the total apertures .",
    "this analysis of the aperture effects justifies our choice to use the total petrosian magnitude to compute the relative normalisation of the optical and nir spectra .",
    "total petrosian magnitudes are much more stable than magnitudes integrated in small apertures comparable with the seeing , which therefore rely on uncertain psf convolution . on the other hand , we have shown that they do not introduce significant biases between different spectral regions .",
    "the systematic aperture bias of 0.026 mag between @xmath29 and @xmath45 is in fact well within the photometric uncertainties estimated in the previous section .    in the following analysis",
    "we will adopt 0.1 mag as standard error on the optical - nir colours and 0.05 mag on the optical colours , to take into account both photometric errors and aperture effects .",

    "black thick lines are used to ( over)plot heavily smoothed versions of the spectra , in order to ease the identification of possible spectral features , especially in the nir bands : smoothing over 15 pixels is adopted both in the optical and the nir spectra , resulting in rest frame resolution of @xmath63 , 60 and 90     in optical , h and k ranges , respectively .",

    "we report also the light - weighted stellar age and metallicity and corresponding uncertainties derived from optical absorption features as in @xcite .",

    "the actual slope of the optical continuum generally shows the well known dependence on age and metallicity , although dust attenuation may affect the slope as well . we do not attempt to put any constraint on this parameter , but discuss its possible impact on our conclusions below .",
    "three galaxies , psbj0227@xmath400015 , psbj0328@xmath400045 , and psbj1150@xmath400107 show significant h@xmath15 emission ( and some higher ionisation lines for psbj0328@xmath400045 ) , indicating some residual ongoing star formation , which is also confirmed by ( marginal ) detections at 22  @xmath2 m ( w4 ) in the wise all sky survey @xcite , measured with snr of 4.4 and 2.8 , and 2.0 , respectively .",

    "it is worth noting that two of these galaxies ( psbj0227@xmath400015 and psbj0328@xmath400045 ) also have a blue core , supporting the idea that blue cores might be related to some residual star formation extending close to the present time .",
    "the absence of emission lines and blue cores from the majority of the galaxies in our sample further confirms their nature of genuine post - starburst galaxies .",
    "what is most important for the scope of this work is the lack of any evidence for sharp features in the nir in any of the 16 galaxies .",

    "apart from this minor colour difference , our detailed spectroscopic study of individual psb galaxies confirms and reinforces the previous results by @xcite , based on stacking and medium band photometry and at a very different age of the universe .",
    "we have presented the first spectroscopic study of post - starburst galaxies covering both the optical ( sdss ) and nir ( our new vlt - isaac observations ) wavelength ranges , which was specifically designed to detect the two main signatures of the presence of tp - agb stars predicted by the @xcite models in contrast to `` tp - agb light '' models ( such as bc03 ) : _ i ) _ the strong nir absorption features caused by carbon composite molecular band - heads ; and _ ii ) _ the boosting of the nir flux . to this goal , we have carefully selected a sample of 16 galaxies with post - burst ages corresponding to the peak contribution by tp - agb stars to the nir flux ( 0.51.5 gyr ) , in a broad range of stellar metallicities ( @xmath1042.5 @xmath8 ) .",
    "these galaxies are at high enough redshift ( 0.150.25 ) to allow clean measurements of the nir features at rest wavelengths 1.41 and 1.77  @xmath2 m through the atmospheric h and k windows . despite these ideal conditions for the detection of the characteristic signatures of tp - agb stars predicted by the ma05 models , the 16 galaxies in our sample all display smooth , featureless nir spectra and blue optical - nir colours .",
    "interestingly , these observed spectral properties are generally well reproduced using the bc03 models assuming simple ( i.e. single - age ) stellar populations .",
    "we have investigated whether the observations could be reproduced with ma05 models as well , by combining stellar populations of different ages .",
    "we find that diluting the light of a young ( i.e. a few 100 myr old ) starburst with that of a massive old component allows the ma05 models to reproduce the typical `` e+a '' optical spectra of post - starburst galaxies characterised by strong balmer absorption lines and a well developed d4000 break . at the same time , such models exhibit very weak nir features , in agreement with the observations , because tp - agb stars from the young component have not developed yet , while the nir emission from old stellar populations is smoother .",
    "however , these models still can not account for the data , because the predicted ratio of nir to optical flux is significantly larger than observed at the metallicity of our galaxies . hence",
    ", the observed lack of deep nir absorption features and the modest ratio of nir to optical flux in our data can not be simultaneously accounted for by a simple `` light dilution '' effect .",
    "we note that the observation of metal absorption lines at optical wavelength does not support the idea that the faint nir continuum ( and the consequent dilution and/or absence of strong nir absorption features ) could arise from extremely low metallicities .",
    "the ma05 models predict too red optical - nir colours for any choice of ratio between the old and the young component . on the contrary ,",
    "models based on bc03 fail for `` old '' mass fractions as high as 90% , but produce colours that are consistent with ( most of ) the observations for `` old '' mass fractions up to 6070% , which leaves enough space to accommodate more reasonable sfhs than a ( possibly unrealistic ) single burst .",
    "we note that the work of @xcite indicates old fractions close to 90% for their seven psb galaxies , which would be inconsistent with our seds .",
    "however , this estimate might be biased by their assumption of fixed solar metallicity .",
    "moreover , and probably more importantly , it is possible that our objects are somehow more extreme in terms of burst fraction , because , due to our redshift constraints , we select objects close to the faintest limit of the spectroscopic sample of the sdss . in this way we would select the intrinsically most luminous psb galaxies at @xmath103 , hence those with the largest burst fraction ( i.e. with the lowest `` old '' fraction )",
    ": in fact , for a given total mass , a higher burst fraction yields higher luminosity . the lack of strong colour gradients in most of our psb galaxies lends support to this hypothesis , suggesting that the starburst substantially affected the full extent of the galaxy , rather than the centre only .",
    "finally , @xcite point out that their sample is less extreme than typical samples of psb galaxies in the literature due to the small physical size of the spectroscopic fiber ( few hundred parsecs ) , which bias their selection towards central rather than extended starbursts . in conclusion",
    ", the consistency of our seds with bc03-based csps and `` old '' mass fractions up to 6070% does not raise any problem for the physical interpretation of our psb galaxies using the bc03 models .",
    "we also find that attenuation by interstellar dust , using standard prescriptions , can only worsen the disagreement ( when present ) between spectral evolution models and the observed optical - nir colours of post - starburst galaxies in our sample .",
    "this is particularly true for the ma05 models , which predict systematically redder colours than observed .",
    "we note that heavier - than - implemented attenuation by _",
    "circumstellar _ dust of the most luminous c stars about to eject their envelopes could potentially reduce the contribution by these stars to the integrated spectrum and perhaps improve the agreement of the ma05 models with observations .",
    "a more accurate theoretical and empirical assessment of the effects of circumstellar dust absorption is definitely key to make progress in the sed modelling of the stellar population affected by tp - agb stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the results presented in this work confirm the previous claim by @xcite that bc03 , and more generally `` tp - agb light '' models , provide a better agreement with the spectral properties of galaxies hosting a stellar population at the peak of the tp - agb phase than ma05 models .",
    "the important novelty of our work is to base these conclusions on a higher - resolution , high - quality spectrophotometric dataset and an optimal spectroscopic sample selection .",
    "somehow in contrast with these studies and our work in particular , @xcite have detected the 1.77  @xmath2 m feature in a couple of magellanic cloud s globular clusters and found them in agreement with ma05 predictions .",
    "this result calls for more observations in order to obtain a representative sample of globular clusters over a broader range of metallicities ( the two in which the detection was obtained are both at metallicity between 0.2 and 0.6 solar ) and beat down stochasticity effects : in fact , a single ( tp-)agb star can produce a substantial fraction of the total cluster nir luminosity in the mass range explored .",
    "one further possibility to reduce the apparent disagreement between the @xcite results and ours might reside in a technical aspect of their challenging observations : the addition of targeted agb stars outside of the central region to integrate the central spectrum and obtain full spatial coverage of the globular clusters might lead to agb stars being over - represented with respect to the stars that contribute the bulk of the diffuse emission .    in the light of this complex and partly controversial observational framework , the apparent agreement of the bc03 models ( of either simple or composite stellar populations ) with the observations presented in this paper should not be necessarily interpreted as an indication that the description of the tp - agb phase in these models is adequate .",
    "new models incorporating more recent developments in the theory and observation of tp - agb stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are being assembled ( charlot & bruzual , in preparation ) . by providing a better account of observations , new models of this type",
    "will allow deeper insight into the physical properties of galaxies from spectral interpretations , especially at high redshift , where a large number of galaxies is going through the evolutionary phase affected by tp - agb stars . in this perspective , the present work provides key and very stringent constraints for the new generation of stellar population synthesis models .",
