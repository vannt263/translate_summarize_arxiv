    "recent experiments by mohanty , jariwala and webb @xcite attracted a lot of attention to the fundamental role of interactions in disordered mesoscopic systems .",
    "these experiments strongly indicate that the low temperature saturation of the electron decoherence time @xcite @xmath4 in disordered conductors has an intrinsic nature .",
    "further analysis @xcite allowed to rule out various experimental artifacts and several theoretical explanations based on extrinsic effects .",
    "can one expect the effect @xcite theoretically ?",
    "in @xcite we developed a nonperturbative theoretical analysis of the above phenomenon .",
    "we demonstrated that the low temperature saturation of the decoherence rate @xmath5 in disordered mesoscopic systems can have an intrinsic nature : it can be caused by the electron - electron interaction .",
    "the results @xcite are in a good agreement with experimental findings @xcite .",
    "we also argued @xcite that this interaction - induced decoherence at low @xmath6 has the same physical nature as in the case of a quantum particle interacting with a bath of harmonic oscillators @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in @xcite and in some other papers it was argued that interaction - induced dephasing of electrons at @xmath7 is not possible .",
    "let us review the main arguments in favor of this conclusion @xcite .",
    "one of such arguments is not necessarily related to electrons in a disordered metal .",
    "one can argue that a particle with energy @xmath8 can not excite harmonic oscillators with frequencies @xmath9 and , hence , the latter can only provide some renormalization effects . within this scenario electron scattering on such a static potential",
    "is purely elastic and can not lead to dephasing .",
    "it is easy to observe that the above argument explicitly contradicts to the exact results obtained e.g. within the caldeira - leggett model @xcite . in this model",
    "even at @xmath2 the off - diagonal elements of the particle density matrix decay at a finite length set by interaction with an effective environment .",
    "this effect is due to _ all _ high frequency modes , i.e. the picture is by no means `` static '' .",
    "our results @xcite demonstrate that also in disordered conductors the high frequency `` quantum '' modes with @xmath9 _ do _ contribute to electron dephasing .",
    "one can also argue that the electronic system can behave differently from a bosonic one @xcite because of the pauli principle which restricts the electron ability to exchange energy at low @xmath6 .",
    "again , this argument contradicts to the well known results obtained for _ fermionic _ systems .",
    "e.g. tunneling electrons exchange energy with the effective environment ( formed by other electrons in the leads ) even at @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this so - called `` p(e)-theory '' @xcite yields measurable consequences and was verified in many experiments @xcite . a close formal and physical similarity between the p(e)-theory and our analysis @xcite is discussed in @xcite .",
    "a more formal argument is based on a perturbative calculation @xcite .",
    "the authors @xcite argued that their results explicitly contradict to ours and , hence , the latter can not be correct .",
    "a direct comparison between the above results is not quite simple .",
    "the main reason for that is that our calculation @xcite is essentially nonperturbative .",
    "it was performed with the exponential accuracy which is sufficient to determine @xmath4 and the weak localization correction to the conductance @xmath10 in the leading approximation for all values of the magnetic field .",
    "@xcite considered the limit of strong magnetic fields @xmath11 ( @xmath12 is the decoherence time due to the magnetic field ) in which one can calculate the subleading correction to @xmath13 perturbatively in the interaction . in this case",
    "the dephasing time @xmath4 can be extracted from a perturbative expression for @xmath14 only if one makes an additional assumption about the explicit form of the phase relaxation in time .",
    "no such assumption is needed within our analysis .",
    "in addition to that , the perturbative results @xcite were presented only in the high temperature limit @xmath15 which , being combined with @xmath11 , is equivalent to a strong inequality @xmath16 .",
    "no such inequality was imposed in our calculation @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we establish a direct relation between perturbative and nonperturbative results in the problem of quantum dephasing in disordered conductors .",
    "we will demonstrate that ( i ) the perturbation theory in the interaction is insufficient for the problem in question and ( ii ) in order to determine @xmath4 it is necessary to perform a nonperturbative analysis with the exponential accuracy .",
    "we analyze both the dephasing rate and the system magnetoconductance for various temperatures and the magnetic fields .",
    "originally the dephasing time @xmath4 of electrons in disordered conductors was introduced and evaluated by altshuler , aronov and khmelnitskii within a phenomenological nonperturbative procedure @xcite .",
    "later fukuyama and abrahams @xcite studied the problem perturbatively in the interaction . since then the perturbative approach was frequently used in the analysis of quantum dephasing .",
    "we are going to demonstrate that this perturbative strategy is insufficient and does not allow to unambiguously determine the dephasing time even in those limits where the weak localization correction to the conductance can be calculated perturbatively in the interaction .    in what follows",
    "we will restrict our analysis to quasi-1d disordered systems .",
    "extension of our results to higher dimensions is straightforward @xcite . in the 1d case",
    "the weak localization correction to the wire conductance reads @xmath17 here the function @xmath18 accounts for the electron - electron interaction ( @xmath19 without interaction ) .",
    "provided in the long time limit the function @xmath20 decays faster than @xmath21 the integral ( [ 1 ] ) converges even for @xmath22 and we get @xmath23 where @xmath24 depends on the particular form of the function @xmath20 .",
    "this result is obviously nonperturbative in the interaction .",
    "e.g. if one formally defines the `` interaction strength '' @xmath25 in the effective hamiltonian , in certain limits one will obtain @xmath26 and , hence , @xmath27 . for @xmath28 any attempt to expand the conductance in powers of @xmath25 is meaningless and may only yield divergences in all orders .    in order to avoid this problem",
    "the authors @xcite suggested to consider the limit of strong magnetic fields @xmath11 . in this case",
    "the integral ( [ 1 ] ) is cut at times @xmath29 much shorter than @xmath4 and the expansion of @xmath30 in powers of @xmath31 can be performed . keeping only the leading terms of this expansion , from ( [ 1 ] )",
    "one readily finds @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "we observe that a perturbative expansion in the interaction allows us to determine the combination @xmath34 but not @xmath4 itself .",
    "the full function @xmath18 ( and thus @xmath35 ) will remain unknown .",
    "although in the limit @xmath11 the value @xmath36 can be calculated perturbatively in the interaction , this would yield no information about the dephasing time @xmath4 .",
    "such information can be extracted from the perturbation theory only if one _ assumes _ some particular form of the function @xmath18 . but this form should be _ found _ rather than assumed .",
    "this task can be accomplished only if one goes beyond the perturbation theory .    in order to illustrate this conclusion",
    "let us consider several different functions @xmath18 .",
    "perhaps the most frequent choice of this function is @xmath37 this _ assumption _ was also adopted in @xcite . performing a perturbative calculation in the high temperature limit @xmath15 the authors",
    "@xcite arrived at the result @xmath38 which , being combined with ( [ 2a ] ) and ( [ 1a ] ) , yields the dephasing rate @xcite @xmath39 .",
    "another possible choice of the function @xmath20 can be @xmath40 for @xmath41 this function  as well as ( [ 1a ] )  yields eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "however , in the limit @xmath42 from ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 1b ] ) one finds @xmath43 clearly , this result is _ incompatible _ with eq .",
    "( [ 2a ] ) because @xmath35 should not depend on @xmath12 and @xmath4 . at the same time from ( [ 1b ] )",
    "one has @xmath44 , and again the contradiction between ( [ 2a ] ) and ( [ 2b ] ) is obvious . also , combining ( [ 2b ] ) with the perturbative results @xcite one arrives at @xmath45 in agreement with @xcite but in a clear disagreement with @xmath46 found in @xcite .",
    "finally , let us choose the trial function @xmath20 in the following form : @xmath47 where @xmath48 . for @xmath28 the result ( [ 2 ] )",
    "is recovered again , while in the limit @xmath11 one arrives at eq .",
    "( [ 2a ] ) with @xmath49 . combining this result with those of @xcite one finds @xmath50 . for @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53",
    "this result would imply respectively positive , infinite and even negative dephasing rates , which is an obvious nonsense .",
    "the above examples clearly demonstrate that a perturbative procedure is _ principally _ insufficient for our problem because it leads to completely ambiguous results for @xmath4 . at the same time",
    "the nonperturbative eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) yields practically indistinguishable magnetoconductance curves ( see fig . 1 of @xcite ) and _",
    "the same _ dephasing time @xmath4 ( up to a prefactor @xmath24 which can be absorbed in @xmath4 anyway ) for all the trial functions @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .    in order to obtain correct information about @xmath4",
    "one should determine the function @xmath20 at times @xmath57 .",
    "this can be done only by means of a nonperturbative calculation simply because for @xmath57 there exists no small parameter in the problem .",
    "choosing the limit @xmath11 enables one to find @xmath58 but _ not _ @xmath4 .",
    "we can also add that the phenomenological procedure @xcite allows to non - perturbatively treat only the contribution of `` classical '' modes @xmath59 , whereas the effect of `` quantum '' modes @xmath9 is accounted for by means of the nonperturbative analysis @xcite .",
    "this analysis will be extended further in the next section .",
    "let us express the function @xmath20 ( [ 1 ] ) in the form @xmath60 without interaction one has @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "for a complete description of the effect of interaction on the weak localization correction ( [ 1 ] ) it is in general necessary to evaluate both functions @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "an important observation is , however , that information about the effect of interaction on @xmath3 is not needed to correctly evaluate the dephasing time @xmath4 , it is sufficient to find only the function @xmath1 which describes the decay of correlations in time and provides an effective cutoff for the integral ( [ 1 ] ) at @xmath57 .",
    "the role of the pre - exponent @xmath3 is merely to establish an exact numerical prefactor .",
    "since @xmath4 is defined up to a numerical prefactor of order one anyway , it is clear that only the function @xmath1  and not @xmath3  is really important .",
    "the function @xmath1 can be straightforwardly evaluated by means of the path integral formalism .",
    "this procedure amounts to calculating the path integral for the kernel of the evolution operator over the particle coordinate @xmath63 and the momentum @xmath64",
    "@xcite @xmath65 within the saddle point approximation on pairs of time reversed paths and to averaging over diffusive trajectories . here",
    "@xmath66 and @xmath67 represent the electron action on the two parts of the keldysh contour , while @xmath68 accounts for the interaction .",
    "the general expressions for @xmath69 and @xmath70 were derived in @xcite . within rpa",
    "these expressions contain the full information about the effect of interaction in _ all _ orders of the perturbation theory .",
    "the saddle point approximation procedure was also described in details in @xcite .",
    "one can demonstrate that the contribution of the real part @xmath69 of the action vanishes on any pair of diffusive time reversed paths .",
    "note that such cancellation is a generic property of a wide class of influence functionals describing dissipative environments .",
    "e.g. the same cancellation is observed in the caldeira - leggett model @xcite and in some other models @xcite .",
    "hence , the function @xmath1 in the exponent ( [ f ] ) is determined only by the imaginary part of the action @xmath70 @xcite . for the sake of generality here we will present the result for all dimensions . evaluating @xmath70 on pairs of time reversed saddle point paths we find @xcite @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 . \\label{fott}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that in 1d and 2d cases the integral of the first term over @xmath74 diverges at @xmath75 . however , this divergence is exactly canceled by the second term and the whole integral is finite in any dimension .    evaluating the result ( [ fott ] ) for a 1d case in the quantum regime @xmath76",
    "we obtain @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the elastic mean free time .",
    "note , that apart from the leading linear in time term there exists a smaller term @xmath79 , which also grows in time . in the opposite thermal limit @xmath80 eq .",
    "( [ fott ] ) yields @xmath81 , \\label{fthermal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath82 is the dzeta - function .",
    "we observe that in both cases ( [ fquantum ] ) and ( [ fthermal ] ) there exists a linear in time temperature independent contribution to @xmath1 which determines the dephasing time @xmath4 at low temperatures @xcite . beside that at @xmath83 there exists another term @xmath84 which yields dominating contribution to @xmath4 at high temperatures @xmath85 , where the result @xcite @xmath86 is recovered .      a rigorous calculation of the pre - exponential function @xmath87 in ( [ 1 ] ) in the presence of interactions is beyond the frames of the present paper .",
    "fortunately the precise form of @xmath88 for all times is not interesting for us here . of importance",
    "is to qualitatively understand how the function @xmath88 is modified in the presence of the electron - electron interaction .",
    "it is well known @xcite that without interactions the function @xmath88 is related to the return probability of diffusive trajectories to the same point after the time @xmath89 . in the presence of dissipation ( described by the term @xmath69 in the effective action ) the particle energy decreases and its diffusion slows down .",
    "this implies that at any given time @xmath89 the function @xmath88 should exceed @xmath21 . on the other hand , at least if the interaction is sufficiently weak , diffusion will take place at all times and , hence , @xmath88 will always decay as @xmath21 or slower .",
    "the latter  intuitively obvious ",
    "property of the pre - exponent was confirmed by our analysis @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath88 indeed decays at all times and no compensation of the exponential decay @xmath90 by the pre - exponential function @xmath88 can occur in the long time limit .",
    "another important property @xcite is that in the interesting limit of low temperatures the effect of interaction on the pre - exponent becomes important at @xmath57 , i.e. on the same time scale as for the function @xmath1 in the exponent .",
    "these two properties allow to completely ignore the effect of interaction on the pre - exponent @xcite .",
    "in the short time limit @xmath91 the correction to the pre - exponent due to interaction is small and one can proceed perturbatively in the interaction . at @xmath7 in the leading approximation one finds @xcite @xmath92 this equation is important for deriving the perturbative expressions for the magnetoconductance in the limit @xmath11 .",
    "the corresponding results are presented below .",
    "let us evaluate the weak localization correction ( [ 1 ] ) in the limit of strong magnetic fields @xmath11 . performing the short time expansion of both @xmath93 and @xmath3 to the first order and combining ( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ f ] ) with ( [ fquantum ] ) , ( [ acorr ] ) , in the limit @xmath94 we find @xmath95 it is easy to observe that this result does not contain the zero temperature dephasing time at all .",
    "the linear in time terms in the expressions for @xmath1 ( [ fquantum ] ) and @xmath3 ( [ acorr ] ) cancel each other exactly in the first order .",
    "the same cancellation occurs in the limit @xmath15 . again combining ( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ f ] ) with ( [ fthermal ] ) , ( [ acorr ] ) and expanding @xmath93 to the first order in @xmath96 , at @xmath15 we obtain @xmath97 .",
    "\\label{gz155}\\ ] ] in order to establish the exact numerical prefactor in front of the last term in ( [ gz155 ] ) we also took into account the @xmath6-dependent linear in time contribution to @xmath3 @xcite omitted in eq .",
    "( [ acorr ] ) .",
    "we note that the result ( [ gz155 ] ) agrees ( up to a numerical prefactor of order one in front of the term @xmath98 ) with the perturbative result @xcite obtained in the same limit @xmath99 .",
    "however , as it was already discussed above , no information about the dephasing time at low @xmath6 can be extracted from ( [ gz155 ] ) .",
    "finally , let us derive the expression for the weak localization correction in the limit of high temperatures and weak magnetic fields @xmath100 . in this limit",
    "the phase relaxation is determined by the term @xmath101 in ( [ fthermal ] ) . keeping this term in the exponent , expanding the exponent in @xmath102 to the first order and making use of a short time expansion of @xmath3 we get @xmath103 here",
    "@xmath104 is the euler s gamma - function .",
    "the first term in the right - hand side of this expression corresponds to the classical result @xcite , while the second term represents the first correction to this result . with decreasing temperature",
    "this correction grows faster than the absolute value of the first term . at the same time in the high temperature limit",
    "the second term in ( [ chva3 ] ) always remains much smaller than the first one and the higher order terms should also be taken into account already at @xmath105 .",
    "note that the result ( [ chva3 ] )  as well as eqs .",
    "( [ gz156 ] ) , ( [ gz155 ] )  does not depend on the zero temperature value of @xmath4 , this value drops out due to the same cancellation of the linear in time @xmath6-independent terms from the exponent and the pre - exponent .",
    "thus also the first order high temperature expansion of the weak localization correction to the conductance can not provide correct information about the electron dephasing time at low temperatures .    in conclusion , we established an explicit relation between perturbative and nonperturbative results in the problem of quantum dephasing in disordered conductors .",
    "the dephasing time remains finite down to @xmath2 due to the electron - electron interactions .",
