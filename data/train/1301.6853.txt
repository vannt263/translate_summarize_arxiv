    "the pioneering work of belinskii , khalatnikov , and lifshitz @xcite has shown that anisotropic bianchi type - ix universes could exhibit chaotic dynamics as it approaches the cosmological singularity @xmath0 .",
    "the anisotropic bianchi ix universe , as it approaches the singularity , exhibits an oscillatory mode consisting of an infinite sequence of kasner eras , during which two scale factors oscillate and the remaining scale factor decreases monotonically . independently , misner @xcite also suggested a chaotic approach to initial singularity in his mixmaster universe ( vacuum bianchi ix universe characterized by three scale factors ) .",
    "while the aspect of chaotic dynamics helped deepen our understanding of singularities in general relativity , there have been significant challenges in finding an invariant measure of chaos .",
    "a standard measure of chaos is the lyapunov exponent , and a debate started on whether or not the mixmaster universe is chaotic , when some studies found zero lyapunov exponent for the mixmaster universe , while others found a positive lyapunov exponent @xcite .",
    "the conflict was resolved when it was realized @xcite that lyapunov exponent is coordinate dependent and therefore is not a reliable measure of chaos in general relativity .",
    "cornish and levin @xcite demonstrated the appearance of chaos in the dynamics of the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) models with a cosmological constant and scalar fields conformally coupled to the geometry .",
    "the presence of the cosmological constant creates a saddle point in the phase space , and the separatrix connects this saddle point to other critical points . when there are interactions between the geometry with the scalar fields , the separatrix breaks up and becomes fractal .",
    "the work by de oliveira , soares , and stuchi @xcite emphasized that even small perturbations induces the breaking of highly unstable separatrix .",
    "the presence of a positive cosmological constant and a perfect fluid creates a saddle - center in the phase space , and non - integrability of the system induces distortion and twisting of the topology of homoclinic cylinders in the neighborhood of the critical point .",
    "the fractal and topological structures are coordinate - independent and thus provide invariant characterization of chaos in relativistic theories .",
    "regarding such a system as a model of the early universe , a natural question that arises is whether the einstein gravity is reliable or not .",
    "it has been pointed out @xcite that we might have the trans - planckian issue ; at early stages of inflation , the quantum gravity effects are not necessarily negligible .",
    "previous works on chaotic dynamics in the per - inflationary era focused on einstein gravity , but as we approach the planck scale , it is reasonable to expect higher order corrections to the einstein - hilbert action .",
    "superstring theory is the leading candidate for a description of physics at such scale .",
    "our goal in this paper is to use an invariant characterization of chaos and investigate the existence of chaotic dynamics in `` string - inspired '' modified gravity .",
    "our model takes into account the effects of the higher curvature terms that typically arise in the one - loop low - energy effective superstring action . for simplicity",
    "we focus on a model in which a scalar field representing the string moduli is non - minimally coupled to the gauss - bonnet curvature . for a related work on chaotic dynamics of higher curvature modified gravity , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the bianchi type - ix models with a scalar field coupled to the gauss - bonnet term are studied in somewhat different context of singularity avoidance in @xcite .",
    "the new features introduced by our model are a positive cosmological constant and a perfect fluid , which create saddle points in the phase space of the system .",
    "because this method does not work for the case of zero cosmological constant , our work implies that in order for the universe to inflate we need to include a positive cosmological constant in the low - energy effective action .",

    "[ sec : numerical ] we present numerical evidence of cylindrical topology , oscillatory behavior around the critical point , and fractal structures in the basins of attraction when small perturbations are introduced in the metric and/or the scalar field .",
    "the fractal structures in the basins of attraction , as well as the topology of cylinders , constitute invariant characterization of chaos , and we conclude that chaotic dynamics can arise in our string - inspired model .",
