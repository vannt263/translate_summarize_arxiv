    "vortices are key features for type - ii superconductors in determining a critical magnetic field and a critical current . in general ,",

    "a magnetic structure of a fm causes a magnetic field in the superconductor and this magnetic field affects the superconductivity .",
    "it was found that the vortices appear and because of a pinning effect on vortices , transport properties such as a critical current of the sc changes .",

    "the chiral helimagnet consists of spins that form a helical rotation along some direction in fig.[fig1 ] ( a ) .",
    "this helical spin ordering comes from a competition between two interactions ; the dzyaloshinsky - moriya interaction and the ferromagnetic exchange interaction . the dzyaloshinsky - moriya interaction is expressed as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are localized nearest neighbor spins along one direction@xcite .",

    "when @xmath11 is much smaller than @xmath9 , directions of @xmath5 and @xmath6 are slightly deviated from the ferromagnetic structure because of the competition between two interactions .",
    "this deviation leads to the helically clockwise rotated structure of spins along the direction of the vector @xmath7 . under an applied magnetic field ,",
    "the magnetic structure of the chm transforms into an incommensuate magnetic structure , which is called a chiral soliton lattice ( csl ) in fig.[fig1 ] ( b ) .",
