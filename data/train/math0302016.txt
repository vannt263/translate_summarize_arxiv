    "@xmath9 is one commonly used estimator of the unknown distribution function @xmath0 ( here @xmath10 is the indicator function ) .",
    "the e.d.f . has an impressive set of good statistical properties such as it is first order efficient in the minimax sense ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "more or less recently , other second order efficient estimators have been proposed in the literature for special classes of distribution functions @xmath0 .",
    "golubev and levit ( 1996a , b ) and @xcite are two of such examples .",
    "it is rather curious that a step - wise function can be such a good estimator and , in fact , @xcite shows that , for the class of analytic functions , for small sample sizes , the e.d.f .",
    "is not the best estimator . in this paper",
    "we study the properties of a new class of distribution function estimators based on iterated function systems ( ifss ) introduced by the authors in a previous work @xcite .",
    "ifss have been introduced in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the main idea on which this method is based consists of thinking the estimation of @xmath0 as the fixed point of a contraction @xmath1 on a complete metric space .",
    "the operator @xmath1 is defined in terms of a family of affine maps @xmath3 and a vector of parameters @xmath2 . for a given family @xmath3",
    ", @xmath1 depends only on the choice @xmath2 .",
    "the idea , known as _",
    "inverse approach _ ( see section [ sec2 ] ) is to determine @xmath2 by solving a constrained quadratic optimization problem built in terms of sample moments . in this paper",
    "this optimization problem is solved by a penalization method .",
    "the nature of affine maps allow to derive easily the fourier transform of @xmath0 and , when available , an explicit formula for the density of @xmath0 via anti fourier transform . in this way , given @xmath3 and @xmath2 we have at the same time estimators for the distribution , characteristic and density functions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ] the inverse approach",
    "is presented and a penalization method is proposed in order to solve a quadratic optimization problem .",
    "we also discuss the choice of the family of maps @xmath3 . in section [ sec3 ] numerical results and comparisons with classical estimators are shown for small samples via monte carlo analysis .",
    "finally we show an application of these estimators when the empirical distribution function ( or the kernel density estimator for the density ) can not be applied .",
    "we will consider situations of missing data when , for example , the data can only be observed on some windows of the support of @xmath0 .",
    "this can be the case of directional data analysis when , for some reason , instruments are not able for technical or physical reason to collect data in same range of angles say @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "for @xmath14 in @xmath11 or @xmath12 the e.d.f . will be constant and , at the same time , the kernel density estimator will estimate a plurimodal distribution for these data . in this case",
    "we will show examples in which the ifs estimator does it job incredibly well .",
    "tables and figures can be found at the end of the paper after the references .",
    "the theory of distribution function approximation via ifss we will use to derive estimators is due to @xcite .",
    "results from this section , apart from were explicitly mentioned , are from the cited authors .",
    "let @xmath15 be the set of probability measures on @xmath16 , the @xmath17-algebra of borel subsets of @xmath7 where @xmath18 is a compact metric space ( in our case will be @xmath19 $ ] and @xmath20 the euclidean metric . )    in the ifss literature the following _ hutchinson _ metric plays a crucial role @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a complete metric space ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we denote by @xmath23 an _ @xmath24-maps contractive ifs on @xmath7 with probabilities _ or simply an _",
    "@xmath24-maps ifs _ , that is , a set of @xmath24 affine contraction maps , @xmath25 , @xmath26 with associated probabilities @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "the ifs has a contractivity factor defined as @xmath30 defined as    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the inverse function of @xmath33 and @xmath34 stands for the composition . in hutchinson ( 1981 ) it was shown that @xmath35 is a contraction mapping on @xmath36 i.e. for all @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "thus , there exists a unique measure @xmath39 , the _ invariant measure _ of the ifs , such that @xmath40 by banach theorem .",
    "associated to each measure @xmath41 , there exists a distribution function @xmath0 . in terms of it",
    "the previous operator @xmath35 can be rewritten as @xmath42      for affine ifss there exists a simple and useful relation between the moments of probability measures on @xmath15 .",
    "given a @xmath24-maps ifs@xmath23 with associated markov operator @xmath35 , and given a measure @xmath43 then , for any continuous function @xmath44 ,    @xmath45    where @xmath46 .",
    "in our case @xmath47\\subset\\mathbb r$ ] so we readly have a relation involving the moments of @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "let @xmath50 be the moments of the two measures , with @xmath51 .",
    "then , by , with @xmath52 , we have @xmath53 set @xmath19 $ ] and let @xmath48 and @xmath54 , @xmath55 with associated moments of any order @xmath56 and @xmath57 then , the following statements are equivalent ( as @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) :    1 .",
    "@xmath60 , 2 .",
    "@xmath61 , @xmath62 ( weak * convergence ) , 3 .",
    "@xmath63 .",
    "( here @xmath64 is the space of continuous functions on @xmath7 ) .",
    "this result gives a way to find and appropriate set of maps and probabilities by solving the so called problem of moment matching . with the solution in hands , given the convergence of the moments , we also have the convergence of the measures and then the stationary measure of @xmath35 approximates with given precision ( in a sense specified by the collage theorem below ) the target measure @xmath48 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "next result , called the _ collage _ theorem is a standard product of the ifs theory and is a consequence of banach theorem .    * ( collage theorem ) :* let @xmath65 be a complete metric space",
    ". given an @xmath66 , suppose that there exists a contractive map @xmath5 on @xmath67 with contractivity factor @xmath68 such that @xmath69 .",
    "if @xmath70 is the fixed point of @xmath5 , i.e. @xmath71 , then @xmath72 .",
    "so if one wishes to approximate a function @xmath73 with the fixed point @xmath70 of an unknown contractive map @xmath5 , it is only needed to solve the inverse problem of finding @xmath5 which minimizes the collage distance @xmath74 .",
    "the main result in forte and vrscay that we will use to build one of the ifs estimators is that the inverse problem can be reduced to minimize a suitable quadratic form in terms of the @xmath75 given a set of affine maps @xmath33 and the sequence of moments @xmath56 of the target measure .",
    "let @xmath76 be the simplex of probabilities .",
    "let @xmath77 , @xmath78 be subsets of @xmath79 the infinite set of affine contractive maps on @xmath19 $ ] and let @xmath80 the set of the moments of any order of @xmath43 .",
    "denote by @xmath35 the markov operator of the @xmath24-maps ifs @xmath23 and by @xmath81 , with associated moment vector of any order @xmath82 .",
    "the collage distance between the moment vector of @xmath48 and @xmath83 @xmath84 is a continuous function and attains an absolute minimum value @xmath85 on @xmath86 where @xmath87 moreover , @xmath88 as @xmath89 .",
    "thus , the collage distance can be made arbitrarily small by choosing a suitable number of maps and probabilities .",
    "the above inverse problem can be posed as a quadratic programming one in the following notation @xmath90 @xmath91    then by there exists a linear operator @xmath92 associated to @xmath35 such that @xmath93 . in particular @xmath94 thus @xmath95 @xmath96,\\quad    q_{ij } = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{a_{ki } a_{kj}}{k^2},\\quad i , j = 1,2,\\ldots , n,\\ ] ] @xmath97 the series above are convergent as @xmath98 and the minimum can be found by minimizing the quadratic form on the simplex @xmath86 .",
    "the estimator will then be built by substituting the moments of the target measure with the empirical moments and by truncation of the above series to a finite sum .",
    "when practical cases are considered , in particular concerning estimation , the previous series have to be truncated and this implies that the matrix @xmath99 is assured to be definite positive .",
    "standard numerical procedures for the minimization of constrained quadratic optimization problems involving positive definite quadratic forms can not be used in this context . to solve this problem",
    "an approach is to build the following penalized function @xmath100    @xmath101    and then to study the following problem    @xmath102    it is trivial that an optimizer @xmath103 of ( lop ) such that @xmath104 is also an optimizer for the problem    @xmath105    for solving ( lop ) numerically , we have used the method l - bfgs - b due to @xcite which allows to minimize a nonlinear function with box constraints , i.e. when each variable can be given a lower and/or upper bound .",
    "the initial value of this procedure must satisfy the constraints .",
    "this uses a limited - memory modification of the bfgs quasi - newton method . the method ` ' bfgs is a quasi - newton method ( also known as a variable metric algorithm ) .      as we are mostly concerned with estimation",
    ", we briefly discuss the problem of choosing the maps . in @xcite",
    "the following two sets of wavelet - type maps are proposed . fixed and index @xmath106 ,",
    "define    @xmath107 and @xmath108 then set @xmath109 or @xmath110 respectively .",
    "to choose the maps , consider the natural ordering of the maps @xmath111 and operate as follows @xmath112 and @xmath113 respectively .",
    "in @xcite we proposed the following quantile based maps @xmath114 where @xmath115 , and @xmath116 are @xmath117 equally spaced points on @xmath118 $ ] . with these maps",
    ", it has been shown that , there is no need to use a moment matching approach .",
    "in particular , given @xmath119 , the ifss turns out to be a smoother of the e.d.f .",
    "and so it has nice small sample and asymptotic statistical properties ( see cited reference ) even for non compact support distribution functions @xmath0 . here",
    "we will also mix the quantile information with the moment matching idea .",
    "to distinguish the two cases ( fixed @xmath119 or @xmath2 solution of @xmath120 ) we will use the notation @xmath121 and @xmath122 later on .",
    "we recall , from @xcite results that are rather straight forward to prove but also essential to us since we will use them in density estimation and in particular in presence of missing data .",
    "simplicity is due to affinity of the maps .",
    "we assume that the support of the measures is @xmath123 $ ] without loss of generality .    given a measure @xmath43 , the fourier transform ( ft ) @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is the complex space , is defined by the relation @xmath126 with the well known properties @xmath127 and @xmath128 , @xmath129 . it can be shown that the space of characteristic functions @xmath130 can be made metric and complete with an opportune metric .",
    "thus , given a @xmath24-maps affine ifs@xmath23 it is possibile to define a new linear operator @xmath131 whose unique fixed point reads as @xmath132 this @xmath133 is the ft of the fixed point of the @xmath24-maps affine ifs@xmath23 .",
    "now ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suppose that the target distribution @xmath0 admits a density @xmath5 .",
    "it is possible to write the density @xmath5 via fourier expansion .",
    "in fact , @xmath134 thus @xmath135",
    "suppose to have an i.i.d .",
    "sample on @xmath136 observations with common unknown distribution function @xmath0 with compact support on @xmath8 $ ] which has all the moments up to order @xmath35 .",
    "an ifs estimator of @xmath0 is the fixed point of the functional @xmath137 where the @xmath24 maps are choosen in advance and the @xmath75 are the solution of the ( * qp * ) quadratic programming problem where in the expression on @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 we replace , in equations and , the true moments @xmath56 with the sample moments @xmath141 , @xmath142 for a fixed @xmath35 and we consider the first @xmath35 terms of the series involved",
    ".    given the solution of ( * qp * ) , we have an estimator for @xmath0 and an estimator for the characteristic function of @xmath0 , say @xmath143 .",
    "suppose that @xmath0 posseses a density @xmath5 then we have further a ( fourier ) density estimator for @xmath5 @xmath144 where @xmath145 and @xmath146 , the number of fourier terms , is choosen in the usual way , i.e. @xmath147 ( see again * ? ? ?",
    "tables [ tab : a ] and [ tab : b ] show camparisons between the empirical cumulative distribution function @xmath148 and the ifs estimator , say @xmath149 , for some target distributions @xmath0 , in terms of average mean square error ( amse ) and sup - norm ( sup ) distance .",
    "these tables contain monte carlo analysis where 100 simulations have been done for each target distribution .",
    "tables report the average ratio of the sup norm ( and amse ) of the ifss over the corresponding sup norm ( respectively amse ) of the empirical distribution function .",
    "it is possible to notice that the ifs estimator based on maps @xmath150 has good properties for symmetric bell - shaped distributions and distributions with not so heavy tails ( see also figure [ fig : beta22 ] ) .",
    "it is also evident the asymptotic equivalence of the ifss to the e.d.f . when quantile maps are used .",
    "remark that , for @xmath150 we have decided to use 62 maps , for @xmath151 28 maps and @xmath152 quantiles for the quantiles maps @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "so it is evident that for wavelet - type maps an adjustment can be done by choosing a suitable number of maps in terms of the sample size @xmath136 .",
    "suppose now that the for some reason , the @xmath136 sample observations from @xmath0 are in fact a subset of a biggest sample , of unknown size .",
    "in practice we do not observe the data on the whole support of @xmath0 @xmath8 $ ] but only on some windows .",
    "this sample reduction has happened due to some sort of censoring .",
    "so we are in presence of missing data when we do not know how many data are missing and where exactly they were missed , i.e. we are not in a classical censoring setup .",
    "a motivation for this scheme of ( non)-observation is the following : suppose one wants to estimate the distribution of the angle of the wind registered by some instruments in degrees ( 0,360 ) .",
    "for some reason , data from angles ( 15,37 ) and ( 62,79 ) are missing for technical failures or physical obstacles . in this case",
    "the empirical distribution function will be flat on these windows and a kernel density estimator will probably show a bimodal behaviour .",
    "heuristically , this is due to the fact that quantile estimation is inappropriate in this context . at the same time , moments estimation tend to be more robust , in particular if the distribution is symmetric .",
    "we only report a graphical example of what can happen .",
    "figure [ fig : missing ] is about a sample from a beta(2,2 ) distribution when only the observation in @xmath153 are available to the observer all the other being truncated by the instrument ( we have choose this interval by hazard ) .",
    "the ifs estimator with @xmath150 maps seems to be able to reconstruct the underlying distribution and density function , whistle , for obvious reasons both the e.d.f . and",
    "the kernel estimators fail . in this example the relative efficiency ( ifs / edf ) is 7% for the amse and 23% for the sup - norm which is dramatically better than expected !      1 .   calculate sample moments 2 .",
    "choose the family of maps @xmath3 3 .",
    "build the quadratic form and solve it for @xmath2 4 .",
    "if you want to estimate @xmath0 at point @xmath14 : take any distribution function , for example the uniform over @xmath8 $ ] and start to iterate @xmath1 5 .",
    "stop after few iteration ( normally 5 is enough ) 6 .",
    "the `` fixed point '' of @xmath1 evaluated in @xmath14 is the estimate of @xmath154    in case the support of @xmath0 is not known one case use the range of the sample but the resulting ifs estimator will then try to approximate a distribution function which has exactly that support .",
    "if any hints on the shape of the distribution @xmath0 is available , use it to choose the maps .",
    "all the examples , tables and graphics have been done by some software developed by the authors . in particular , a package called ` ifs ` is freely available for the r environment system @xcite in the cran ( comprehensive r archive network ) ` http://cran.r-project.org ` under the _ contributed _ section .",
    "it seems that this kind of approach can be used to make nonparametric inference when data are missing or sample size are small . remark that with this method it is only possible to work with distributions with compact support .",
    "moreover , a knowledge on the support itself it is needed .",
    "neverthless , it seams a promising approach and the use of different sets of maps merits further investigation .",
