    "the influence of applied magnetic field or substitutions effects are more complicated .",
    "a strong magnetic field is necessary to suppress the ho order and generate final fermi - liquid behavior via intermediate field - induced phases between 35 and 38 t with * _ q@xmath15 _ * = ( 0.6 0 0 ) @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that few at.% substitution of various transition metals ( re , rh , fe , os , tc ) for ru destroy the sc and induce magnetic states .",
    "the doping weakens the ho state and transform it to long - range magnetic order that is for different dopant different ( the af order with q@xmath12 = ( 1 0 0 ) being the most frequent one)@xcite . in some cases the crossover between the ho state and dopand - induced long - range magnetic order is smooth ( as in the case of fe doping ) , in other cases a gap between the two ground states exists ( the case of rh ) @xcite preceded by a tiny concentration region where the lmaf phase seems to inhomogeneously coexist . focusing on the case of rh doping , a shift of the large critical fields of metamagnetic transitions to lower fields",
    "is found @xcite . above  4  % of rh substitution for ru",

    "the low - concentration rh region , where the ho coexists with the parasitic lmaf , has been extensively studied in the past @xcite . also the higher rh doping levels",
    ", that exhibit magnetic order with high ordering temperatures , have been inspected to a certain extend @xcite .",

    "this region is most interesting as it should be pure fermi liquid , free of influences of any long - range order and offers a possibility to disclose the `` bare '' behavior of heavy electrons in such lightly doped rh systems .",

    "our findings suggest that the heavy - fermion behavior is common to all the lightly doped uru@xmath2si@xmath2  systems and that the ho transition is a result of coherence phenomenon within the heavy - fermion liquid .",
