    "it is seen that taking into account the contribution of the nuclear interior and use the experimental data more accurate than those in ref.@xcite one can strongly influence the extracted values of the anc s for @xmath188(g.s . ) and @xmath198(0.429 mev ) .",
    "a comparison of the present result and that obtained in paper @xcite shows that the underestimation of the contribution both of the nuclear interior and of the nuclear exterior indeed occurs in @xcite since the present value of anc @xmath196 obtained from the analysis of the more accurate experimental astrophysical @xmath0-factor [ 6 - 10 ] is larger than that obtained in @xcite .",

    "the bound state wave functions and the initial state wave functions in @xcite were computed with different potentials and , so , these calculations were not self - consistent . besides , the values of the binding energies for the bound states of @xmath15 calculated in ref.@xcite differ from the experimental ones .",
    "therefore , the calculated value of the binding energy for the bound state of @xmath15(g.s . ) in the ( @xmath34)-channel ( 4.73 mev , see table i in ref.@xcite ) is also not in agreement with the experimental one ( 1.59 mev ) .",
    "since the anc s ( or nvc s ) for @xmath205 are sensitive to the form of the nn potential @xcite , it is desirable , firstly , to calculate the wave functions of the bound state using other forms of the nn potential , and , secondly , in order to guarantee the self - consistency , the same forms of the nn potential should be used for such calculation of the initial wave functions . besides , one would also like to note the recent result of ref.@xcite obtained for @xmath192 and @xmath193 from the analysis of the experimental @xmath14 astrophysical @xmath0-factors performed within the r - matrix method , where the contribution from the internal part of the amplitude was simulated by the background for a single pole . but there to reduce the number of free parameters the assumption about equality of the anc s ( @xmath203 ) was used , and the best fitting of the data was reached at @xmath192=3.79 @xmath125 and the channel radius @xmath206=3.0 fm .",
    "it follows from here that in reality the values of the anc s , @xmath192 and @xmath193 , should not be equal .",
    "moreover , the calculation shows that the asymptotic behavior of the bound ( @xmath34 ) state and @xmath207-scattering wave functions is reached , as it was mentioned above , simultaneously only at @xmath208 5.0 fm and , so , at @xmath209 3.0 fm their substitution for these wave functions in the external part of the amplitude in ref.@xcite is not correct .",
    "the @xmath7indirectly measured values of the anc s for @xmath211 obtained in the present work and those for @xmath212 deduced in ref.@xcite can be used for obtaining information on the ratio @xmath213 for the virtual @xmath12 decays of the bound mirror ( @xmath13 ) -pair , where @xmath214 is the spectroscopic factor for @xmath15 ( @xmath215 ) in the ( @xmath216)((@xmath217))-configuration . for this aim",
