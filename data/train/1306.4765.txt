    "the formation of ordered structures is one of the main topics in the field of condensed matter physics . starting from the relative straightforward crystalline order",
    "a wide variety of increasingly complex ordering phenomena has been observed and proposed such as stripes@xcite , charge density waves@xcite , incommensurate phases@xcite and so forth .",
    "these complex ordering patterns usually arise as a result of competing interactions .",
    "for example , the kinetic energy of holes competes with the tendency towards antiferromagnetic order in cuprates thus forming stripes . in annni models ,",
    "the next - nearest neighbor ising coupling has the opposite sign as the nearest neighbor coupling .",
    "the question immediately arises whether higher - order commensurate or incommensurate phases can appear in systems with only one type of interaction .",
    "of course this is the case . in the continuum",
    "the sole presence of long - range interactions will cause particles to form a wigner crystal . when a fixed number of particles are placed on an underlying lattice the desired wigner crystalline order may be incommensurate with the lattice , thus leading to frustration .",
    "we have investigated the influence of long - range interactions on charge ordering phenomena on a square lattice .",

    "@xcite we explored the full range of particle densities @xmath2 and types of long - range interactions @xmath3 .",
    "our main result is summarized in figures [ pd ] ( zero temperature ) and [ pdfinitet ] ( finite temperature ) , where we depict phase diagrams of unusual charge ordered patterns . at low densities",
    "the competition between the continuum triangular wigner lattice and the underlying square lattice indeed leads to a plethora of ` generalised wigner ' crystals . at higher densities , this leas to variations of the checkerboard pattern which is well - known at half - filling .",

    "close to half - filling we find checkerboard order which has a smooth crossover to the ` checkerboard - in - a - checkerboard ' @xmath13 phase . around @xmath14 and @xmath15",
    "there are stripe ordered phases ( see section [ sectionstripes ] ) .",
    "the transitions towards the @xmath13 and checkerboard phase are second order , the other transitions are first order . ]",
    "the lay - out of this paper is as follows . in section [ sectionlgm ]",
    "we introduce the lattice gas model , which is the model describing interacting classical particles on a lattice . in the two subsequent sections we discuss qualitatively the ordered structures at low densities ( section [ sectionwigner ] ) and at densities close to half - filling ( section [ sectionstripes ] ) .",
    "we have performed a monte carlo simulation in section [ sectionnumerics ] to derive the zero temperature phase diagram of figure [ pd ] . in section [ sectionfinitet ]",
    "we extend these results to finite temperatures using mean field theory , see figure [ pdfinitet ] .",
    "the lattice gas model can be defined on any kind of lattice but we focus only on the square lattice . on each of the @xmath16 lattice sites",
    "there can be a particle or not , denoted by @xmath17 or @xmath18 respectively .",
    "these particles interact via some general potential @xmath19 .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian is then @xmath20 we subtract the average particle density @xmath21 to prevent divergent energies . in the grand - canonical ensemble , the chemical potential @xmath22 tunes the average particle density @xmath23 .",
    "the model ( [ lgmodel ] ) is in fact equivalent to the ising model@xcite . under the replacement @xmath24 and considering only a nonzero nearest neighbor interaction @xmath25 one finds @xmath26 the chemical potential maps onto an external magnetic field @xmath27 , while the particle density maps onto the mean magnetization .    for the ferromagnetic ising model the ground state is completely magnetically ordered , which amounts to either a full or empty lattice in the lattice gas parlance . in addition , a model with antiferromagnetic coupling will be half - filled with particles if the external magnetic field is small , @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , using the standard grand canonical ensemble will in general not enable us to investigate all possible particle densities : a canonical ensemble - fixed particle number - is required .",
    "we argue that most physical realizations of lattice gas models are in fact at a fixed particle number , and not at fixed chemical potential .",
    "one particular example is the oxygen ordering in ybco planes , where it is beyond doubt that the number of oxygen ions in the lattice is fixed@xcite .",
    "the patterns in which the oxygen ions align themselves are quasi - one - dimensional , in a manner similar to the expected electronic ordering in ttf - tcnq salts @xcite . whilst studying the latter",
    ", hubbard has developed a general solution for the ground state of a lattice gas model with long - range interactions at any particle density in one dimension .",
    "hubbard s solution only requires the interaction energy as a function of distance to be convex .    among two - dimensional realizations of lattice gas models",
    "are for example the ordering of ad - atoms on a surface@xcite , xy systems@xcite , higher order commensurate magnetic phases@xcite or stripe order in high - temperature superconductors@xcite . especially systems with anisotropic short - ranged interactions or competing short- and long - range interactions@xcite have acquired considerable attention over the years , therefore we wish to focus here to the case of long - range isotropic interactions@xcite .    most studies of lattice gas models in two dimensions however restrict their attention to half - filled , empty and full lattices , due to the aforementioned grand - canonical reasons .",
    "there are two notable exceptions : the stripe order discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite between @xmath9 and @xmath29 filling and the glassy dynamics at @xmath7 filling@xcite .",
    "these results were obtained for a ` quasi - logarithmic ' repulsive interaction which is a solution of poisson s equation on a lattice , @xmath30 . given the nontrivial ordering patterns discovered there , as a follow - up we present here a systematic study of the ground state orderings at all densities between @xmath18 and @xmath29 , for general repulsive interactions @xmath31 in the next two sections we will first discuss qualitatively such long - range lattice gas models at fixed densities , while in the remaining sections the picture will be further quantified using numerical simulations and mean field theory .",
    "in the previous section we introduced the lattice gas model , that we will now study at fixed densities on the square lattice with long - range repulsive interaction of the form ( [ interactionmodel ] ) . in the limit of very low particle density ,",
    "the underlying square lattice becomes irrelevant compared to the average inter - particle distance , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the lattice constant . in the continuum description of particles repelled by a long - range force , wigner@xcite showed that the interaction energy is minimized when the particles form a crystalline structure , which is triangular in two dimensions interactions and compared the energies of various different lattice structures . in his work the triangular lattice had the lowest energy . even though no other structure has been found with a lower energy ,",
    "the wigner crystallization into a triangular lattice is not rigorously proven . for classical particles studied in this publication",
    "the exact energy is equal to the quantum second order perturbation result since that amounts to the expectation value of the interaction energy . for logarithmic interactions we refer to studies of vortex lattices that indicate that triangular lattices are in that case the lowest energy configurations@xcite . for @xmath34 interactions we compared the energy of the triangular lattice with the square lattice , which again favors the triangular lattice . ] . in general",
    ", one can state that the energy of a wigner crystalline state of the particles is@xcite @xmath35 where @xmath16 is the number of lattice sites of the underlying lattice , @xmath21 is the particle density and the summation runs over the particles in the wigner crystal .",
    "the distance between particles in the wigner crystal @xmath36 scales with the inverse square root of the density .",
    "therefore the energy in the low density limit scales as @xmath37 the presence of the underlying lattice is now a source of frustration .",
    "@xcite considers an underlying triangular lattice , leading to frustration only if the density is not of the form @xmath38 .",
    "for example , when @xmath39 a perfect triangular wigner crystal can be formed . on top of a square lattice , however , it is not possible to form a triangular wigner crystal because @xmath40 is irrational .",
    "one can nevertheless construct ` almost perfect ' triangular crystals .",
    "as an example , consider the density @xmath41 , see figure [ fig1_9 ] .",
    "the lowest energy state is there also a triangular crystal of particles , but not equilateral as for a perfect wigner crystal . in principle",
    "such ` almost perfect ' wigner crystals could exist at densities @xmath42 with @xmath43 integers while @xmath44 , such that the following equilateral triangle relation is approximated by @xmath45 for example , the densities @xmath41 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 etcetera would allow such ` almost perfect ' triangular crystal .",
    "following the work of hubbard@xcite in one dimensional systems , we will call these particle orderings ` generalized wigner crystals ' . from this qualitative reasoning",
    "we argue that such wigner crystals _ might exist_. note , however , that one has to resort to a numerical computation to find whether such crystals have indeed the lowest energy at a given density .",
    "( color online ) at density @xmath39 a triangular crystal of particles is formed , which is not equilateral as would be the case for a perfect wigner crystal .",
    "it is thus a prime example of a generalized wigner crystal .",
    "the unit cell and unit vectors of the wigner crystal are shown . ]    ) the associated crystal structure will be maintained .",
    "we put forward the hypothesis that this leads to a devil s staircase of generalized wigner crystals at low densities .",
    "the figure shows the crystal structure versus density obtained by mean field theory ( see section [ sectionfinitet ] ) at @xmath48 , displaying a staircase ( thick solid lines ) . the thermodynamic potential ( [ thermopot ] ) relative to the disordered state is shown ( decreasing red dashed line ) , the thin lines underneath indicate the energy of specific ordered states . ]",
    "so far we only considered densities of the form @xmath49 .",
    "when the density of a lattice gas is in between such densities , we suspect that it is favorable to maintain a generalized wigner crystal structure .",
    "the deviation from the @xmath50 density can be accommodated by a superlattices of crystal defects or interstitial vacancies . if such a superlattice of defects forms , still the original @xmath50 order is visible in for example the fourier transformed particle density , where each crystal type has its own specific fourier peaks .",
    "we expect therefore a plateau at densities in the vicinity of each specific @xmath50 , where the associated crystal structure remains intact modulo the interstitial superlattice .",
    "as we will describe in more detail later when discussing the numerical results , indeed a plateau is observed for the @xmath8 , @xmath7 and @xmath6 states .",
    "using mean field theory , we went as far as the @xmath51 crystal phase , as is shown in figure [ devilsfig ] .",
    "we have therefore strong indications the plateau - structure exists all the way to @xmath52 , yielding an infinite staircase of plateaux .",
    "this structure is reminiscent of the _ devil s staircase _ , as exists in the case of the one - dimensional lattice gas in the grand - canonical ensemble@xcite , where specific charge orderings are stable for a finite window of chemical potential .",
    "notice that starting at @xmath8 filling the generalized wigner crystal picture certainly fails .",
    "if one adds one single particle to the @xmath8 crystal , it will be necessarily next to another particle .",
    "since the nearest - neighbor repulsion is the strongest , and nearest - neighbor occupancy can be avoided for any density below half - filling , the @xmath8 crystal will be quickly destroyed upon adding particles . for densities above @xmath8 it is necessary to start reasoning from the ordering occurring at the half - filled lattice .",
    "exactly at half - filling the ground state is ` checkerboard ' like , or antiferromagnetic in the ising language .",
    "this means that one sublattice is exactly filled and the other sublattice is completely empty .",
    "densities slightly less than half - filling can be obtained by removing particles from the checkerboard pattern , a process we call hole doping .",
    "the density of holes @xmath53 is defined as follows @xmath54 where @xmath21 is the total particle density .",
    "the same scaling arguments for the dilute particle limit @xmath55 can be applied to the dilute hole limit @xmath56 , so close to half - filling the energy scales as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the energy of the half - filled checkerboard configuration and @xmath59 is some proportionality constant .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",height=60 ]    this scaling argument assumes that all particles will remain on the filled sublattice of the checkerboard phase .",
    "however , the checkerboard phase is a broken sublattice symmetry phase and therefore domain walls and topological defects can exist between regions where the checkerboard phase is realized on different sublattices .",
    "though the ground state at densities slightly less than half - filled might be unrelated to the checkerboard phase , we discuss in this section possible structures that are related to the checkerboard .",
    "thus the smallest example , which is neglected in the scaling arguments of equation ( [ scalehf ] ) , is shown in figure [ figdomainwalls]a .",
    "there a single particle on the ` wrong ' sublattice is surrounded by holes , which is obviously a stable configuration .    on a large scale domain walls",
    "may exist such as the one depicted in figure [ figdomainwalls]b .",
    "however , such a straight domain wall is not stable .",
    "one can imagine a single particle moving to the other side , thus causing the domain wall to meander .",
    "the energy difference between the configurations in figure [ figdomainwalls]b and figure [ figdomainwalls]c is given by the energy of that single moved particle , @xmath60 where the prime on the summation means that we should exclude @xmath61 .",
    "since the meandering domain wall has a lower energy than the straight one , the latter is unstable .",
    "this argument can be pursued further to the point where one finds that only a diagonal domain wall , as shown in figure [ figdomainwalls]d , is locally stable .",
    "the resulting domain wall has a surface energy that vanishes in the thermodynamic limit ; but is extremely stiff with respect to bending .",
    "now a single domain wall on a infinite lattice will not affect the average particle density .",
    "however , to obtain particle densities away from half - filling one can introduce a macroscopic number of domain walls .",
    "such a periodic array of domain walls constitutes a ` stripe phase ' , similar to the ones discussed in cuprates@xcite , nickelates@xcite , manganites@xcite or cobaltates@xcite .",

    ". the arguments of hubbard@xcite then apply and one can thus find the specific stripe ordering , as is shown in figure [ stripef]a and b.    but again , for some densities it may pay off not to form perfect stripes but rather to dope a stripe structure as in figure [ stripef]c .",
    "it is then a matter of numerical computation to find out whether the ground state is a hubbard - type stripe pattern or a ` doped ' stripe pattern .",
    "lee , lee and kim@xcite call these doped stripe patterns ` partially filled diagonal channels ' .",
    "finally , we must emphasize that the discussion in this section does in no way whatsoever constitute a proof of existence of stripe ordered or hole doped checkerboard phases . the only way to find the state with the lowest energy is a tedious numerical computation .",
    "let us now describe the numerical algorithm that was used to find the lowest energy configurations .",
    "first notice that for each form of order there is symmetry breaking and hence a degeneracy in the ground state . as the simplest example , observe that the checkerboard configuration at half - filling is two - fold degenerate .",
    "however , for the purpose of finding the specific type of charge order , we do not need to worry about ground state degeneracy .",
    "in our algorithm we took various different types of initial configurations , such as the generalized wigner crystals of section [ sectionwigner ] , stripe structures of section [ sectionstripes ] , wigner crystal structures of defects in the checkerboard , variations of the checkerboard phase , suggestions from literature and a large ensemble of random configurations .",
    "we then swapped filled and empty sites randomly .",
    "a swap is accepted if it lowers the total energy of the system .",

    "the method of simulated annealing , by which we mean slowly reducing the temperature to zero , was therefore also used to avoid getting stuck in a local energy minimum . upon comparing the energies of configurations obtained from the various initial configurations , using both zero temperature swapping and simulated annealing",

    "figure [ 7a ] gives an example of this energy comparison at @xmath95 .",

    "we find that the corresponding phase diagram for screened interactions is largely similar to figure [ pd ] , with only small quantitative differences that do grow with decreasing screening length @xmath98 .",

    "we have computed a finite temperature mean field phase diagram using standard mean field theory@xcite , for the @xmath84 interaction ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "it is of course highly questionable whether mean field theory correctly describes the competition between various phases .",

    "results from the annni model thus suggests that mean field theory acts as a qualitatively reliable first approximation towards the understanding of complex ordering patterns .",
    "let us now briefly summarize the quintessence of our mean field theory . for the model hamiltonian ( [ lgmodel ] ) we postulate an ansatz for the density , @xmath99 where there can be as many ordering wave vectors @xmath100 as one needs to correctly describe the specific charge order . for example",

    "since mean field theory gives only a qualitative phase diagram , and because the zero - temperature phase diagram of figure [ pd ] suggests little qualitative difference between various interaction ranges , we restrict ourselves to the coulomb interaction @xmath111 .",

    "the transition to the checkerboard phase and the similar checkerboard - in - a - checkerboard @xmath13 phase is of the second order type within the ising universality class@xcite . the thermodynamic potential for some temperatures around @xmath118 , with its typical second order transition behaviour , is shown in figure [ finitetenergy]a .",
    "the question arises whether this @xmath13 ` phase ' is an artefact of the mean field theory . as is known at half - filling , a liquid - like state with local checkerboard order exists in the presence of long - range interactions@xcite .",
    "such correlated liquid phase can also be present away from half - filling , but will be beyond the scope of standard mean field theory .",
    "the phase transitions to more complicated orders are always of the first order kind , an example of which is shown in figure [ finitetenergy]b at 1/9 filling .",
    "this is a natural result because transitions from solid to liquid phases are usually discontinuous@xcite .",
    "the existence of such first order transition implies that one can supercool the high - temperature ( or 1/4 ) state@xcite . at @xmath82 for example , the @xmath13 phase remains a local minimum of the free energy even though its energy is higher than that of the stripe phase , see figure [ finitetenergy]c .",
    "this suggests that it might be hard to actually trap the system in the lowest energy state .    in combination with our earlier observation that a correlated liquid - like state at intermediate temperatures might exist",
    ", we then also expect glassy physics upon supercooling@xcite . with ` glassy ' we mean that there are macroscopically many local minima of the free energy , leading to slow relaxation rates .",
