    "our knowledge of the first stages of the evolution of powerful radio sources is based on the study of the population of high frequency peaking radio sources . in the framework of models explaining the evolution of individual radio sources , the spectral peak of young radio sources occurs at high frequencies . given their small size , in these sources",
    "the synchrotron self - absorption ( ssa ) is a very effective mechanism .",
    "as the source grows , the peak frequency is expected to shift towards lower frequencies as a consequence of adiabatic expansion .",
    "an alternative explanation suggests that the spectral peak is due to free - free absorption from a ionized medium enshrouding the radio emission @xcite .",
    "both scenarios are supported by the empirical anti - correlation found by @xcite from the study of samples of compact steep spectrum ( css ) and gigahertz - peaked spectrum ( gps ) radio sources .",
    "the former have peak frequencies around a few hundred mhz , typical sizes of a few kpc and ages of 10@xmath0 - 10@xmath1 years , whereas the latter have spectra peaking around 1 ghz , typical sizes of about 1 kpc or less and ages of 10@xmath2 - 10@xmath3 years .",
    "however , it is worth noting that the consistency between the source size and the spectral peak often found in the most compact sources strongly support the synchrotron self - absorption scenario @xcite .",
    "+ high frequency peakers ( hfp ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with a spectral peak occurring at frequencies above a few ghz , are thus the best candidates to be newly born radio sources , with ages between 10@xmath4 - 10@xmath2 years .",
    "+ the radio properties of hfps have been derived by the analysis of the `` bright '' hfp sample @xcite . in particular , from the multi - epoch analysis of their radio spectra it has been found that the sample is composed of two different populations .",
    "one population consists of radio sources that maintain the convex spectrum without showing variability , whereas the other comprises radio sources that change their spectral shape , becoming also flat - spectrum objects , and possessing substantial flux density variability .",
    "the different spectral properties shown by the two populations suggest that the former represent young radio sources still in an early stage of their evolution , while the latter are beamed objects .",
    "the analysis of the multi - epoch spectral behaviour has proved to be a powerful tool to discriminate between the two populations @xcite .",
    "in fact , beamed radio sources , although usually characterized by a flat and variable spectrum , may be selected in samples of high - frequency peaking objects when their emission is dominated by a flaring knot in a jet .",
    "on the other hand , young radio sources are known to be the least variable class of extragalactic radio sources @xcite .",
    "however , it must be mentioned that in the youngest objects , substantial variability in the optically - thick part of the spectrum is expected as a consequence of either the source growth / evolution ( e.g. j1459 + 3337 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or changes in the possible absorber screen , or a combination of both @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper we present a multi - epoch analysis based on simultaneous multi - frequency vla data of the radio spectra of 57 high frequency peakers from the `` faint '' hfp sample @xcite . this sample was selected as the `` bright '' hfp sample @xcite by cross - correlating the 87 gb survey at 4.9 ghz with the nvss at 1.4 ghz , and including only sources fainter than 300 mjy at 4.9 ghz within a restricted area around the northern galactic cap ( for details on the sample see stanghellini et al .",
    "the study of the radio properties of a sample of faint hfps is the first step in understanding the first stages of the radio source evolution .",
    "so far , spectral studies have been carried out for the bright hfp sources only , and an extension to fainter objects is necessary .",
    "the evolution models developed so far ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) predict that in the earliest stage the radio luminosity progressively increases , implying that the youngest objects are likely to be found among faint sources .",
    "furthermore , in faint hfps , boosting effects should be less relevant , making the contamination from blazars less severe than what found in samples of brighter objects .",
    "+ throughout this paper we assume the following cosmology : @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 in a flat universe .",
    "the spectral index is defined as @xmath8 .",
    "+    .vla observations and configurations [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the anti - correlation found between the projected linear size and the peak frequency @xcite implies that the sources with the spectral peak occurring above a few ghz should represent the population of the smallest radio sources whose radio emission has recently turned on .",
    "samples of high - frequency peaking objects have been selected by choosing sources with an inverted radio spectrum up to 5 ghz @xcite , i.e. the highest observing frequency where a large area survey is presently available . however , due to the selection criteria these samples have been found to comprise both young radio sources and flaring flat - spectrum objects selected during particular phases of their spectral variability , for example when their radio emission is dominated by a knot in the jet .",
    "the study of flux density and spectral variability based on repeated simultaneous multi - frequency observations has proved to be an ideal tool in discriminating the different nature of the sources .",
    "it was found that in samples of bright objects , where there is a high incidence of sources optically identified with quasars , flat - spectrum blazar objects represent the dominant population ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". a higher incidence of genuinely young radio sources is expected in samples of faint objects where the majority of radio sources should be hosted in galaxies and boosting effects are supposed to play a minor role .",
    "+ the optical identification of the sources studied in this paper by means of the sdss dr7 indicates that 21% of objects are hosted in galaxies , i.e. similar to the fraction of galaxies in the bright hfp sample . however , in the faint sample , another 21% of objects lack optical identification and thus a reliable comparison between the two samples can not be done .",
    "the analysis of the optical images of the galaxies hosting hfp pointed out the presence of companions around 6 hfp candidates , indicating that young radio galaxies , like powerful extended radio sources , are in groups , as previously suggested by @xcite , indicating a continuity between compact young objects and the population of classical radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "+ although in 4 galaxies the presence of companions is suggested by photometric information only , in j1530 + 2705 and j1602 + 2646 the association is made by spectroscopic redshift .",
    "the companion galaxies are located within a projected distance of about 150 - 200 kpc from the target which usually is hosted in the brightest elliptical at the group centre .",
    "a peculiar case is represented by j1109 + 3831 , whose parent galaxy seems to be a spiral that is interacting with an elliptical .",
    "young radio sources are normally associated with ellipticals .",
    "the case represented by j1109 + 3831 may be explained by the possible interaction between the hosting spiral and the companion that may have triggered the radio emission .",
    "the small redshift of j1530 + 2705 enabled us to identify the morphology of its brightest companions that turned out to be barred spirals .",
    "this group resembles that of the bright hfp j0655 + 4100 @xcite , and in both cases the hfp is hosted by the central elliptical galaxy at the group centre .",
    "the presence of companion galaxies in the environment of galaxies hosting young radio sources suggests that the onset of the radio emission may be triggered by merger or interaction events that occurred not long ago .",
    "this scenario is supported by the proximity of the companions in j0804 + 5431 and in j1109 + 3831 , although observations to establish a physical interaction are needed to unambiguously verify this idea .",
    "+ from the analysis of the multi - epoch radio spectra of the sources in the faint hfp sample , we find a high fraction of objects displaying some level of variability .",
    "this result does not imply that all these sources are part of the blazar population .",
    "in fact , changes in the radio spectrum may be a direct consequence of the source expansion ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . in newly born radio sources ,",
    "the evolution timescales can be of the order of a few tens of years .",
    "changes in the radio spectrum of such young objects can be appreciable after the short time ( 5 - 8 years ) elapsed between the first and last observing run .",
    "a clear example is represented by the faint hfp j1459 + 3337 @xcite .",
    "this hfp showed a steadily increasing flux density at 1.4 and 5 ghz , in the optically thick regime , and its spectral peak shifted from 30 ghz down to 12 ghz in about 10 years @xcite .",
    "this behaviour is consistent with the flux density and spectral evolution of a young object , with an age of about 50 years , undergoing adiabatic expansion .",
    "+ in the presence of adiabatic expansion of a homogeneous synchrotron source , the radio spectrum undergoes a shift towards low frequencies . in the optically - thick regime",
    "this means that at a given frequency the flux density @xmath9 increases with time ( see pacholczyk 1970 , orienti et al .",
    "2007 , and orienti et al .",
    "2008b for a detail analysis of the radio spectrum evolution ) :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the flux densities at the time @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "on the other hand , the spectral peak @xmath15 moves to lower frequencies :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the peak frequency at the time @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively .",
    "+ in the optically - thin regime , the flux density at a given frequency decreases with time :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the spectral index of the electron energy distribution @xmath21 that originates the radio emission .",
    "it is clear from this relationship that substantial variation in the optically - thick regime can be revealed in case that @xmath22 is a non - negligible fraction of the total source age ( @xmath13 ) . in our case ,",
    "@xmath23 years and it can produce detectable flux density variation for sources with @xmath24 100 years . among the sources with some changes in the spectral properties compatible with such a scenario , other 7 sources ( j0754 + 3033 , j0955 + 3335 , j1004 + 4328 , j1025 + 2541 , j1052 + 3355 , j1322 + 3912 , and j1547 + 3518 ) in addition to",
    "j1459 + 3337 show a spectral and flux density variability that may be explained in terms of source expansion .",
    "although in j1459 + 3337 there are several indicators supporting this interpretation @xcite , in the case of the other sources mentioned here this assumption is based on the flux density and peak variation on a small time range only .",
    "additional observations spanning a longer time interval , together with information on the pc - scale morphology are necessary in order to reliably constrain the source nature .",
    "we presented simultaneous multi - frequency vla observations of 57 sources from the faint hfp sample , carried out at various epochs . from the comparison of the spectral properties we found that 24 objects ( 4 galaxies , 11 quasars , and 9 empty fields ) preserve their convex spectrum without showing any evidence of flux density variability .",
    "of the remaining sources , 12 objects ( 2 galaxies , 9 quasars , and 1 empty field ) , selected on the basis of their convex spectrum in the first epoch by @xcite , turned out to show a flat spectrum in one of the subsequent observing epochs .",
    "the remaining 21 sources ( 6 galaxies , 13 quasars , and 2 empty fields ) possess high levels of variability , although still displaying a convex spectrum .",
    "however , among these variable sources we found that in 8 objects the changes in their spectra are consistent with what expected if the source is undergoing adiabatically expansion .",
    "this implies that out of the 57 sources studied in this paper , 32 objects ( 56% ) can still be considered young radio source candidates .",
    "the remaining 25 sources ( 44% ) are part of the flat - spectrum blazar population , indicating that also in samples of faint radio sources , where boosted effects are thought to play a minor role , a large fraction of sources are represented by flaring objects .",
    "+ the analysis of the optical images of the hfps hosted by galaxies pointed out the presence of companion galaxies in the target environment , supporting the idea that young radio sources reside in groups .",
    "the parent galaxy is usually the brightest elliptical at the group centre with the exception of two sources . in j0804 + 5431",
    "the galaxy hosting the hfp is at the periphery of the group , and it seems interacting with a close elliptical . a surprising result is represented by the hfp j1109 + 3831 that is hosted in a spiral that seems to be interacting with a close elliptical .",
    "the fact that young radio sources reside in groups support the idea that the interactions occurring between the galaxies are at the origin of the radio emission .",
