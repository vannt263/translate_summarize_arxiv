    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) is currently well on its way to uncovering the mechanism that underlies the breaking of electroweak symmetry .",
    "the discovery of a higgs - like particle localized at a mass of about 125 gev by atlas and cms  @xcite is just the first step towards a thorough understanding of the phenomenon of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) .",
    "the resonance observed at the lhc sits at a rather special spot for experiment .",
    "in particular , the decays of a sm higgs boson with such a mass have sizable branching fractions into several final states including @xmath0 and @xmath1 . searching for signals of the new particle , produced either singly or in association with @xmath2 bosons , @xmath3 bosons or well separated forward energetic jets ,",
    "the lhc experiments expect to be able to measure with significant accuracy its branching ratios into each of these final states .",
    "these measurements will either confirm that the new state is the sm higgs , or expose it as an impostor .",
    "the availability of this data , and the presence of excesses above the expected background in several different channels ( even above the sm higgs signal hypothesis in some cases ) , has already motivated several analyses that undertake a global interpretation of the properties of the particle responsible for the new physics observed by atlas and cms @xcite . although constrained by the limited luminosity",
    ", these global analyses have yielded several interesting results . in particular , it has been shown that the 2011 data disfavors a fermio - phobic higgs boson @xcite , and limits have been placed on the invisible decay width of the higgs @xcite .",
    "furthermore these efforts have led to a productive discussion among theorists and experimentalists about the way to present the results of experimental searches . as detailed in refs .",
    "@xcite some searches could potentially have a wider reach in terms of physics scenarios that are probed .",
    "the wish would be to see the analyses of inclusive and exclusive final states presented in a broad manner , as opposed to the ( overly ) tuned analysis performed so far in most cases    on the theoretical side , 125 gev is also a rather special value for the sm higgs boson mass .",
    "such a value of the higgs mass is in the far periphery of the preferred parameter space of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , and motivates the study of alternatives to supersymmetry that stabilize the weak scale .",
    "several well - motivated models of electroweak symmetry breaking that solve the hierarchy problem involve strong conformal dynamics above the weak scale . in particular , in models of technicolor  @xcite , for a review see  @xcite , and of the higgs as a pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson ( pngb )  @xcite , strong conformal dynamics can help separate the flavor scale from the weak scale  @xcite , ( see also  @xcite ) , allowing the bounds on flavor - changing neutral currents to be satisfied .    in theories where conformal symmetry is spontaneously broken ,",
    "the low energy effective theory contains a massless scalar , the dilaton , which may be thought of as the nambu - goldstone boson ( ngb ) associated with the breaking of conformal symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the form of the dilaton couplings is fixed by the requirement that conformal symmetry be realized non - linearly , and so this framework is extremely predictive .",
    "several authors have studied the self - interactions of a light dilaton , and its couplings to sm fields  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the couplings of a dilaton to the sm gauge and matter fields are very similar to those of a sm higgs  @xcite .",
    "the reason is that at the classical level the sm has an approximate conformal symmetry which is violated only by the higgs mass term .",
    "since the vev of the higgs doublet spontaneously breaks this approximate conformal symmetry , in the classical limit the couplings of the higgs to the sm fields are very similar to those of a dilaton .",
    "it is therefore very natural to ask the question whether the resonance observed by the lhc at 125 gev could be the dilaton associated with a strongly interacting conformal sector that breaks electroweak symmetry , rather than the sm higgs .",
    "this is the question we shall focus on in this paper .",
    "the remarkable fact that a dilaton can naturally mimic the sm higgs boson has already lead to significant interest in the problem of distinguishing the two at colliders  @xcite . as such it is not surprising that the idea that the new physics behind the 125 gev resonance could be the dilaton ( in combination or not with a higgs boson ) has already been put forward  @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however the types of dilaton that have been considered so far in the post - lhc literature are rather specific , and the analyses do not apply to many of the theories that are of of primary interest for electroweak symmetry breaking . furthermore , these studies do not include the effects of conformal symmetry violation , which is necessarily present since the dilaton is not massless , and can sometimes be significant .",
    "our analysis extends to more general incarnations of the dilaton , incorporates conformal symmetry violating effects , and is directly applicable to a broad class of models that stabilize the weak scale and involve strong conformal dynamics .",
    "specifically we consider the possibility that the new particle that has been observed at 125 gev is a dilaton that arises from a theory of technicolor , or from a theory of the higgs as a pngb , that involves strong conformal dynamics in the ultraviolet . in the pngb case",
    ", we are considering a framework where the higgs particle is significantly heavier than the dilaton and has therefore not yet been observed . in each of the technicolor and pngb scenarios , we study both the case when the sm fermions and gauge bosons are elementary , and the case when they are composites of the strongly interacting sector .",
    "we identify the parameters that can be used to distinguish the dilatons associated with the several different classes of theories being considered from each other , and from the sm higgs .",
    "we perform a fit to all the available data from several experiments and highlight the key observations to extract these parameters .",
    "we also indicate the future observations that should help to corroborate or falsify each scenario .    the ads / cft correspondence",
    "@xcite relates randall - sundrum ( rs ) models in warped extra dimensions  @xcite to strongly coupled conformal field theories in the large @xmath4 limit . in this way , extra dimensional realizations of technicolor  @xcite and of the higgs as a pngb  @xcite have been obtained . in the correspondence , the radion in the rs model",
    "is identified with the dilaton  @xcite .",
    "the couplings of the radion to the sm gauge and matter fields have been studied , both in the case when the sm fields are localized to the infrared brane  @xcite and in the case when they are in the bulk  @xcite , and agree with the dilaton couplings in the appropriate limit .",
    "our results on the dilaton therefore also apply to the radion in rs models , with the sm fields localized on the brane , or in the bulk .",
    "the fifteen parameter conformal group includes scale transformations and special conformal transformations , in addition to the ten parameters of the poincare group . if conformal invariance is spontaneously broken the low energy effective theory contains a massless dilaton field @xmath5 , which can be thought of as the ngb associated with the breaking of scale invariance  @xcite .",
    "the additional four ngbs associated with the breaking of the special conformal symmetry can be identified with the derivatives of the dilaton , rather than as independent dynamical fields . below the breaking scale",
    "the symmetry is realized non - linearly , with the dilaton undergoing a shift @xmath6 under the scale transformation @xmath7 . here",
    "@xmath8 is the scale associated with the breaking of conformal symmetry . for the purpose of writing interactions of the dilaton it is convenient to define the conformal compensator @xmath9 which transforms linearly under scale transformations .",
    "specifically , under the scale transformation @xmath10 , @xmath11 transforms as @xmath12 the low energy effective theory for the dilaton will in general include all terms consistent with this transformation , but with some additional restrictions on their coefficients from the requirement that the theory be invariant not just under scale transformations , but under the full conformal group .",
    "these restrictions will not affect our discussion in any significant way , and so in practice we shall only require that the action for @xmath13 be scale invariant .    in realistic models of electroweak symmetry breaking conformal symmetry",
    "is not exact . as a consequence",
    "the dilaton will acquire a mass , and there will be corrections to its couplings from conformal symmetry violating effects . if the dimension of the operator responsible for the breaking of conformal symmetry is close to marginal even at the breaking scale , the mass of the dilaton can naturally lie below the scale of strong dynamics  @xcite , see also  @xcite .",
    "although this condition is , in general , not satisfied in the scenarios of interest for electroweak symmetry breaking , the presence of a light dilaton in these theories is only associated with mild tuning  @xcite .",
    "this makes it a priori quite plausible that the higgs - like particle observed at the lhc is in fact a dilaton .",
    "corrections to the form of the dilaton couplings to sm states from the conformal symmetry violating effects that generate the dilaton mass are suppressed by the square of the ratio of the dilaton mass to the strong coupling scale  @xcite .",
    "although this is a small parameter in the theories of interest , corrections to the couplings can nevertheless sometimes be significant and will need to be taken into account in our analysis .",
    "the strength of the dilaton couplings is controlled by the parameter @xmath8 , the scale at which conformal symmetry is broken . in technicolor models ,",
    "the same condensate that breaks electroweak symmetry also breaks conformal symmetry .",
    "hence we expect that @xmath8 is of order the electroweak vev , @xmath14 , in theories of technicolor . for models of the higgs as a pngb",
    ", however , the situation is different .",
    "it is the same dynamics that breaks the global symmetry of which the higgs is a pngb that now breaks conformal symmetry .",
    "then , depending on the scale at which the global symmetry is broken , there can be a hierarchy between @xmath14 and @xmath8 .",
    "since precision electroweak measurements prefer the higgs compositeness scale @xmath15 to be 5 tev or larger , the favored values of @xmath8 are such that @xmath16 .",
    "we introduce the variable @xmath17 to parametrize the ratio of breaking scales .",
    "technicolor theories are associated with values of @xmath18 close to one .",
    "meanwhile @xmath19 describes a pngb - like model with the cutoff pushed very high , corresponding to the sm - like limit of these theories . in this limit",
    ", the pngb scenario is highly tuned and completely fails as a solution to the hierarchy problem . on the other hand precision electroweak measurements",
    "prefer the higgs compositeness scale @xmath15 to be 5 tev or larger .",
    "as such a moderate @xmath18 is expected in pngb models to solve the hierarchy problem and not be in tension with precision tests .      the next step is to understand the dilaton couplings to the sm fields .",
    "mixing between the dilaton and a pngb higgs is generally small , particularly if @xmath20 or if the dilaton is significantly lighter than the higgs ( or vice versa )",
    ". we shall therefore neglect it .",
    "the form of the dilaton couplings to the sm fermions and gauge bosons is then the same in the technicolor and pngb cases  @xcite .",
    "we will consider in turn the dilaton couplings to massive gauge bosons , massless gauge bosons and fermions .",
    "the form of these interactions depends on whether the sm fields are elementary particles or composites of the strongly interacting sector , and we will consider both possibilities .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence relates composite fermions and gauge bosons to states localized on or towards the infrared brane in rs models .",
    "elementary fermions are associated with states localized towards the ultraviolet brane and elementary gauge bosons live in the bulk of the space .",
    "the radion couplings to brane and bulk fields in rs models can therefore be determined from the corresponding interactions of the dilaton .",
    "our results for the dilaton are therefore directly applicable to the radion in certain classes of rs models .",
    "however , in our analysis we will not consider constraints on the parameters of the rs model rising from limits on other particles in the spectrum , such as kaluza - klein excitations of the graviton , ( see for example @xcite ) .      depending on the model",
    ", the massive gauge bosons of the sm , the @xmath2 and @xmath3 , could either be elementary particles or composite states that emerge at low energies from the strong conformal dynamics . in either case",
    "the gauge boson mass term @xmath21 is the leading effect which breaks conformal symmetry .",
    "then the dilaton couples in such a way as to compensate for this  @xcite , @xmath22 note that we are working in a basis where the gauge boson kinetic terms have the form @xmath23 we see that the coupling of the dilaton is in general suppressed by a factor @xmath24 with respect to the coupling of a sm higgs boson .",
    "corrections to the form of this interaction from conformal symmetry violating effects are small  @xcite .      in the case of the massless gauge bosons , the photon and the gluon ,",
    "there is no classical source of breaking of the conformal symmetry .",
    "however , at the quantum level conformal invariance is broken , as manifested by the renormalization group evolution of the gauge couplings @xmath25 the dilaton couples in such a way as to compensate for this effect .",
    "the form of this coupling depends on whether the gauge bosons are elementary particles or composites of the conformal field theory .",
    "let us consider first the case when the photon and gluon are elementary .",
    "then the evolution of the gauge couplings is different above and below the strong coupling scale @xmath15 .",
    "we parametrize the running of the gauge couplings above and below @xmath26 by @xmath27 and @xmath28 respectively . above the top mass , @xmath29 for the gluon and @xmath30 for the photon .",
    "the running of the gauge couplings above the scale @xmath26 constitutes an explicit , rather than spontaneous , breaking of conformal symmetry .",
    "a spurion analysis then shows that the dilaton couples to elementary massless gauge bosons as  @xcite @xmath31 this formula is valid at scales slightly below the strong coupling scale @xmath32 .",
    "corrections from the conformal symmetry violating effects that generate the dilaton mass are again small  @xcite .    in the class of theories of interest",
    "the conformal sector necessarily transforms under electromagnetism .",
    "however in theories where the top quark is not composite , this sector need not be charged under the sm color group",
    ". then @xmath33 for sm color , and the leading coupling of the dilaton to the gluons arises from a calculable top loop . in theories where the top quark is composite the conformal sector is necessarily charged under the sm color group .",
    "however , since the gluon is elementary , @xmath27 is not constrained by conformal invariance , and its value depends on details of the specific conformal sector at hand .",
    "the difference @xmath34 is associated with the number of states in the strongly interacting sector with masses of order @xmath26 , and is expected to be of order a few .    in the case of composite gauge bosons , there is no explicit breaking of conformal symmetry above the scale @xmath26 . as a consequence ,",
    "the formula eq .",
    "( [ dil2elementaryphoton ] ) still applies , but with @xmath35  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath28 is known , it would appear that this framework is very predictive .",
    "however , in this scenario , corrections to the dilaton couplings from conformal symmetry violating effects can be significant .",
    "these take the form  @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 is of order one . for @xmath26 of order",
    "the tev scale , and @xmath38 of order 100 gev , this gives a contribution to the dilaton couplings comparable to eq .",
    "( [ dil2elementaryphoton ] ) , and predictivity is lost .",
    "this is particularly so in the case of the photon , less so for the gluon .",
    "for larger @xmath39 tev , these corrections are much smaller , and predictivity is restored .",
    "it follows from this that the couplings of the dilaton to massless gauge bosons , if composite , differ from those of the sm higgs by the product of @xmath40 and a multiplicative factor of order a few .",
    "this factor can be predicted for larger values of @xmath26 , but not for small @xmath26 .      in the case of the sm fermions the leading source of conformal symmetry breaking",
    "are the fermion mass terms .",
    "the coupling of the dilaton depends on whether the sm fermions are purely elementary particles or are composites , or partial composites of the strong conformal dynamics .    in the case of elementary fermions",
    "their mass arises from direct couplings to a scalar operator @xmath41 in the conformal field theory with the gauge quantum numbers of the sm higgs , as in theories of conformal technicolor  @xcite . for the third generation",
    "up - type quarks these couplings take the form @xmath42 this leads to the mass term for the top which we write as @xmath43 the condition that the flavor problem be addressed means that the large value of the top mass constrains the size of @xmath44 .",
    "if we denote the flavor scale by @xmath45 , we require @xmath46    for @xmath47 tev , we require @xmath48 for the technicolor case . for the pngb case , with @xmath49 1 tev ,",
    "the constraint becomes @xmath50 . at the same time",
    ", the hierarchy problem constrains the dimension of the operator @xmath51 to be of order 4 or larger . since @xmath52 necessarily implies that the conformal field theory is free , which in turn implies @xmath53 , the conditions @xmath54 ( or @xmath55 ) and @xmath56 are in tension .",
    "note that these conditions can not be simultaneously satisfied in the large @xmath4 limit , and therefore realistic models of this type with elementary fermions can not be constructed within the rs framework .",
    "unitarity and causality can be used to constrain @xmath57 if @xmath58  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite , ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore the technicolor scenario with elementary fermions is somewhat tuned .",
    "a spurion analysis shows that the dilaton couples to the top quarks as  @xcite @xmath59 this differs by a factor of @xmath60 from the top yukawa coupling in the sm .",
    "more generally , the couplings of all the fermions to the dilaton will differ from that of the sm higgs by this factor .",
    "corrections to this expression from the conformal symmetry violating effects that lead to the dilaton mass are small  @xcite .    from this discussion",
    "it is clear that a useful parametrization of the coupling of the dilaton to the top quark in the case of elementary fermions is as @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",
    "more generally , we can apply the same parametrization to the dilaton couplings with the other fermions as well , so that the interactions of the dilaton with elementary sm fermions differ from those of the higgs by a universal factor of @xmath63 .",
    "another possibility is that the sm fermions are partially composite , emerging from the mixing of elementary fermions with operators in the conformal field theory that have the same gauge quantum numbers  @xcite . for the up - type quarks this takes the form",
    "@xmath64 here @xmath65 and @xmath66 are operators in the cft with scaling dimension @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively , and for simplicity we are suppressing flavor indices .",
    "the resulting mass term is of the form @xmath69 where @xmath70 is proportional to the product @xmath71 up to effects that are higher order in @xmath72 .",
    "a spurion analysis then show that the dilaton couples as  @xcite @xmath73 we see that this coupling differs from that of the sm higgs boson by the factor @xmath74 .",
    "corrections from the conformal symmetry violating effects that generate the dilaton mass are small  @xcite .",
    "however , as in the case of elementary fermions , the scaling dimensions of the relevant operators are bound by phenomenological considerations .",
    "in fact to generate a large mass for the top quark we need @xmath75 and @xmath76 for the third generation to be of order one at the scale @xmath26 .",
    "for a high flavor scale @xmath77 , in the absence of tuning , this implies that the terms in eq .",
    "( [ compositeup ] ) that generate the top quark mass are close to marginal , corresponding to @xmath78 and @xmath79 . as such in this scenario the deviation from the coupling of the sm higgs",
    "is determined by the extent to which the terms in eq .",
    "( [ compositeup ] ) deviate from exact marginality .    for @xmath80 , the terms in eq .",
    "( [ compositeup ] ) are exactly marginal and do not violate conformal symmetry . in this limit the coupling of the dilaton is suppressed simply by a factor of @xmath81 with respect to the coupling of the sm higgs boson .",
    "not surprisingly , the same result is obtained if the sm fermions @xmath82 and @xmath83 are fully composite states , since in this limit the yukawa coupling again arises from an effect that does not violate conformal symmetry .    for our analysis ,",
    "the dilaton couplings to the third generation fermions are particularly important , since the current data is only sensitive to these interactions . for concreteness , in our analysis of partially composite fermions",
    ", we will set @xmath80 for the top quark , corresponding to a fully composite top .",
    "more generally , we will assume that all the third generation sm fermions are primarily composite , so that their coupling to the dilaton is identical to that of the sm higgs up to an overall factor of @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath84    in this section we summarize the couplings of the general dilaton introduced earlier , and identify the observables in the higgs searches that are particularly sensitive to the parameters of the theory .",
    "we specifically focus on the three different classes of theories below :    * theories where the sm fermions and gauge bosons are all elementary , * theories where the sm matter fields are composites of the strong dynamics , but the gauge fields are elementary . * theories where the sm matter and gauge fields are all composite .    for a more compact expression of the parametric behavior of the event rate",
    "we introduce the ratio of the square of the coupling of the dilaton to a given sm state over the square of the corresponding higgs coupling in the sm , @xmath85 the values of @xmath86 at tree - level associated with the different sm states are shown in table  [ tab : couplings ] , both for the case when the third generation fermions are elementary and the case when they are composite . in the scenario where the third generation fermions are composite , the sm gauge bosons could be either elementary or composite .",
    "we parametrize both cases the same way because the only significant difference in the analysis arises from the fact that if the sm gauge bosons are composite , then for larger values of @xmath8 , corresponding to the range @xmath87 , the values of the parameters @xmath88 and @xmath89 are fixed .",
    "we also remark that our parametrization of the couplings to massless vectors does not distinguish between calculable contributions of sm states and a priori unknown and largely unconstrained contributions arising from cft states .",
    "this parametrization has the advantage of simplicity and can be easily mapped onto the predictions of specific uv scenarios .",
    "for instance in the case of composite gauge bosons the prediction would be : @xmath90 it is also possible to parametrize the coupling to massless gauge bosons in a way that separates the sm and cft contributions .",
    "since the sm contribution can be calculated , an experimental determination of the dilaton couplings to the massless gauge bosons would in principle allow the possibility of measuring properties of the cft ( up to the remaining uncertainty on the sm part ) .",
    "since our primary focus is on the issue of distinguishing the sm higgs from the dilaton , we leave this for future work .    in what follows",
    "we consider in turn the scenarios with elementary fermions and composite fermions , and identify in each case the observations that will allow the parameters in table  [ tab : couplings ] to be extracted .      for elementary sm fermions the rate for the final state @xmath91 in the case of a dilaton produced from gluons through a top loop",
    "is given by @xmath92 where by @xmath93 is meant the gluon fusion ( gf ) cross - section for a sm higgs decaying into @xmath91 .",
    "the last line follows from the fact that the dilaton decay width , like that of the higgs , is dominated by the @xmath94 final state .",
    "the final states most sensitive to a higgs - like dilaton produced through gluon fusion are @xmath1 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "these processes are insensitive to @xmath97 , but depend on @xmath18 , and in the case of the @xmath98 final state , also on @xmath88 .",
    "the effect of @xmath97 in the total width is largely cancelled by the enhancement in the coupling to the top that generates the coupling of the dilaton to the gluons .",
    "the fact that the observed rate to @xmath96 is comparable to that of the sm higgs suggests that in this scenario values of @xmath18 very different from unity are disfavored .",
    "a similar analysis for the vector  boson  fusion  ( vbf ) and associated  production  ( ap ) modes leads to @xmath99 we see that in contrast to gluon fusion , the rates of vbf and ap processes do depend on @xmath97 , except in the case of the @xmath94 and @xmath100 final states .    to isolate the effect of @xmath97 it is useful to take the ratio of gf and vbf ( or ap ) rates to the same final state for the dilaton , and for the sm higgs",
    "then , @xmath101 we remark that , especially for the measurement of a small @xmath97 , it might be relevant to include higher - order corrections to the couplings under study , which , in general , make this ratio a function of all the modified couplings of this scenario .",
    "we see from this analysis that the parameters @xmath18 , @xmath97 and @xmath88 can all be independently determined by combining different channels .",
    "for composite sm fermions the parameter @xmath89 replaces @xmath97 in the parametrization of the coupling of the dilaton to the gluons .",
    "we first consider the case of dilatons produced through gluon fusion , @xmath102 we see that the rates to @xmath1 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 now depend on both @xmath89 and @xmath18 , and in the case of @xmath98 on @xmath88 as well .    for dilatons produced through vector boson fusion or associated production , we have",
    "@xmath103 it follows that the vbf and ap modes are sensitive to @xmath18 , but not to @xmath89 .    in analogy with eq .",

    "might not be simple .",
    "for instance the couplings of the dilaton to gluons in the two scenarios are related by a change of parameters @xmath105 as the coupling to vector boson is the same it follows that from the study of the production cross - sections in the gluon fusion and vector boson fusion modes we can not distinguish the two scenarios  ) is that @xmath106 , hence when @xmath107 the scenario with elementary fermions can not be mapped onto the composite fermions scenario . ] .",
    "some more information might be obtained by studying the ( rare ) production in association with @xmath108 or @xmath109 quarks or by adding to the analysis the information from the decay rates .",

    "going to higher order it becomes a function of all the other parameters .",
    "furthermore both qcd and ew corrections should be included . in general",
    "it remains true that for the elementary fermions this ratio is predictable and fixed in terms of the other parameters , which makes the scenario distinguishable from the case with composite fermions .",
    "] in the elementary top scenario and a free parameter in the composite top scenario . to extract this quantity",
    "we can take the ratio of two generic @xmath111 and @xmath112 ( or @xmath113 ) modes @xmath91 and @xmath114 in units of the sm rates @xmath115 and focus on the case @xmath116 , @xmath117 to obtain @xmath118 analogously one can study the @xmath100 final state to get further information .    at the present time the errors on the measurements",
    "are still too large to draw conclusions on the value of this ratio .",
    "however we remark that both atlas and cms reported measurements of the cross - sections involved , steadily improving their results . as such",
    "if the dilaton interpretation of the 125 gev boson will turn out to be more appropriate than the one in terms of a sm higgs boson , there is a chance that the measured cross - sections will provide a handle on the presence of colored states in the cft in the uv .",
    "the lhc and tevatron experiments have searched for higgs - like particles in a variety of final states .",
    "the data analyzed so far exhibits significant excesses over the expectation for the sm background .",
    "striking evidence for a new boson has conclusively emerged from several analyses  @xcite .",
    "while these observations still need to be refined the picture that has emerged seems to point towards new physics associated with a narrow resonance of mass about 125 gev .",

    ", for each relevant searched production and decay mode they presented the best fit value of the _ signal strength _ of a sm higgs boson @xmath119 where @xmath120 denotes the inclusive or exclusive final state searched for , and @xmath121@xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 denotes the production mode of the sm higgs .    for some final states , as for instance @xmath1 ,",
    "the experiments find excesses even compared to the expectations from a sm higgs .",
    "these excesses are not statistically significant , but they nonetheless motivated further investigations of the 2011 and 2012 data in terms of various models of new physics . to increase their sensitivity to new physics",
    "both atlas and cms performed a search for higgs - like resonances in _ exclusive _ final states .    to isolate exclusive final states the dedicated higgs searches require tags of special kinds of events , such as the presence of two energetic forward jet with large rapidity separation and very little hadronic activity in the central part of the detector .",
    "this configuration of qcd radiation accompanying the higgs is typical of the vbf production mode , and therefore the `` dijet '' tag searches are essentially probes of the vbf production of the higgs . furthermore the experiments presented searches for the higgs boson produced in association with a gauge boson , that are sensitive to different kinematical regions , but probe the same couplings as in vbf .",

    "in this paper we have studied in detail the possibility that the 125  gev resonance observed at cern is the dilaton associated with the spontaneous breaking of an approximate conformal symmetry .",
    "our focus has been on theories where this conformal dynamics underlies the breaking of electroweak symmetry .",
    "the discussion has been mostly carried on in a language suitable to describe at the same time scenarios where there is a pngb higgs boson that is relatively heavy and therefore yet to be discovered , as well as scenarios where the breaking of the ew symmetry arises directly from strong dynamics as in technicolor models .",
    "we have considered a rather wide spectrum of possibilities for the properties of the known sm states within the dilaton framework . in particular ,",
    "we have allowed for both elementary and composite fermions .",
    "furthermore we have considered both the case when the sm gauge bosons are composites of the cft and the case when they are elementary states .",
    "we have discussed how the lhc higgs data can be used to investigate the realization of all these scenarios for the dilaton .",
    "in particular we have introduced an effective description of the coupling structure that is suitable to take into account the leading order physics of the interactions of the dilaton with the sm states .",
    "the adopted parametrization naturally accommodates the effects of the breaking of conformal symmetry on the couplings of the dilaton .",
    "the summary of the coupling structure we have considered is reported in table [ tab : couplings ] .",
    "we stress that this parametrization exhibits wide coverage ; for instance it captures dilatons from rs constructions with different embeddings of the fermions as well as dilatons for which there is no known corresponding rs realization .    motivated by the impressive results of the experiments at the lhc",
    ", we have studied the specific measurements that are critical to uncovering the nature of the dilaton that could be responsible for the signal at 125  gev . for this",
    "it was essential to exploit the capabilities that the experiments have demonstrated in disentangling the several exclusive channels that contribute to the data about the 125  gev resonance .",
    "we have shown that using this information it is also possible to address questions about the elementary or composite nature of the sm fermions and gauge bosons .",
    "we have confronted the several possible incarnations of the dilaton against the set of available measurements in higgs searches .",
    "we have identified the regions of the parameter space that are favored by the current measurements , and find that it is generically preferred to have a dilaton whose couplings resemble rather closely those of sm higgs boson .",
    "although we find that the coupling structure of the dilaton does in principle allow better agreement with the central values of the current measurements than the sm higgs , the uncertainties are at the moment sufficiently large that from a global @xmath134 analysis a statistically significant preference does not emerge .",
    "since further data from the 2012 run of the lhc may begin to highlight significant deviations from the predictions of a sm higgs , we believe that it is worth considering the dilaton , in its full generality , as a potential explanation of the new physics at 125  gev .",

    "<S> our analysis incorporates conformal symmetry violating effects , which are necessarily present since the dilaton is not massless , and is directly applicable to a broad class of models that stabilize the weak scale and involve strong conformal dynamics . </S>",
