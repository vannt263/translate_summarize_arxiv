    "using the representation of the diffusion as a time and scale change of brownian motion , one can show easily that the diffusion is recurrent and 0 is a regular point for @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",

    "the way to detect the approximate location of such values when we observe the diffusion in real time ( i.e. , at time @xmath99 we know @xmath113 $ ] ) is to find the site the diffusion has spent the most time thus far .    to make the last statement precise",
