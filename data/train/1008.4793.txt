    "the collective behavior of particles produced in heavy - ion collisions is one of the major topics of study at rhic , and a large quadrupole component in the distribution on azimuthal angle @xmath5 has been observed @xcite . the large quadrupole azimuthal distribution in non - central collisions is usually described by elliptic flow , in which the different pressure gradients in and out of plane turn the initial position - space anisotropy of the colliding nuclei into a momentum - space anisotropy @xcite .",
    "the azimuthal anisotropy is typically measured with the quantity @xmath6 , the second fourier component of the distribution of particle emission on azimuth with respect to the angle of the reaction plane @xcite . in real events",
    "this reaction plane angle is not known so many methods exist to estimate @xmath6 .",
    "the present analysis uses a method based on fitting two - dimensional angular correlations similar to @xcite but expanded to include the dependence on transverse momentum as well as centrality .",
    "a simultaneous analysis of centrality and transverse momentum dependence of @xmath6 in the absence of `` nonflow '' from the same - side 2d peak ( jet - like correlations ) is presented .",
    "one method of measuring @xmath6 is the event - plane method , @xmath7 , in which particles in the region of interest are used to estimate the reaction plane @xcite .",
    "a related approach , @xmath8 , calculates @xmath6 directly from two - particle correlations @xcite .",
    "these two methods are essentially equivalent ( @xmath9 to 5% ) @xcite .",
    "this analysis , denoted by @xmath10 , uses an approach similar to @xmath8 but includes the dependence of the two - particle distribution on pseudorapidity as well as azimuth .",
    "significant jet - like correlations are observed at all centralities @xcite and their 2d angular dependence can be used to distinguish them from the azimuth quadrupole component , which within the star tpc acceptance has no significant @xmath11 dependence @xcite .",
    "jet - like correlations are separated from @xmath10 by 2d model fits described in sec .",
    "[ fitmodel ] .",
    "angular correlations without a trigger particle are constructed by considering all pairs of particles in an event . for each particle",
    "the azimuth angle @xmath5 , pseudorapidity @xmath11 and transverse momentum @xmath0 are measured , defining a six dimensional two - particle space .",
    "integrating over @xmath0 and projecting the angular variables onto their difference axes @xmath12 and @xmath13 yields 2d angular autocorrelations @xcite .",
    "the correlation measure is constructed from pair densities .",
    "sibling pairs from the same event contain the primary signal .",
    "mixed pairs from different events are useful as a reference for removing detector artifacts .",
    "the basic correlation measure we use is @xmath14 , the ratio of the sibling minus the mixed pairs to the mixed pairs , a per - pair measure .",
    "it is also sometimes desirable to use a two - particle measure like @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "however , this analysis uses @xmath14 which is easily converted to @xmath6 : @xmath16 / \\rho_{ref}$ ] , where the @xmath17 $ ] indicates the quadrupole term of the fit model in eq .",
    "[ eqn : fitfunc ] below .    when we consider momentum dependence it is desirable to use transverse rapidity instead of transverse momentum : @xmath18 .",
    "transverse rapidity is the analogue to longitudinal rapidity but in the transverse direction . for unidentified particles we make the approximation @xmath19 to define a regularized @xmath20 measure .",
    "we construct marginal distributions by restricting the @xmath21 range of one of the particles in the two - particle correlation to a certain interval . due to the inherent diagonal symmetry in @xmath22 space",
    "this corresponds to making cross - shaped cuts as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : examples ] ( left panel ) .",
    "these cuts are analogous to the procedure in a standard event - plane @xmath3 analysis @xcite in which particles from the full momentum range are used to estimate the event plane and particles in the momentum interval are correlated to it .",
    "the marginal distributions allow us to study correlations at large @xmath0 values and are easily converted into the usual @xmath3 measure for comparison with published @xmath3 data .    in this analysis",
    "there is a minimum @xmath0 cut for all particles of @xmath23 which corresponds to a pion @xmath21 of 0.93 .",
    "there are nine @xmath21 bins .",
    "the first @xmath21 bin includes all particles with @xmath21 less than 1.4 and the seven subsequent bins are 0.4 units of @xmath21 wide .",
    "the final bin includes all particles with @xmath21 greater than 4.2 .",
    "this corresponds to particles above @xmath24 .",
    "this analysis is based on 14.5 million collisions at @xmath25 and 6.7 million collisions at @xmath26 observed with the star tpc .",
    "the acceptance was defined by transverse momentum @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 azimuth .",
    "minimum - bias event samples were divided into 11 centrality bins : nine @xmath30 bins from near 100% to 10% , the last 10% divided into two @xmath31 bins .",
    "two - particle correlation histograms are constructed for each of the 11 centrality and 9 @xmath21 bins described above for a total of 99 bins at each @xmath32 .",
    "example histograms are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : examples ] . fig .",
    "[ fig : fitparms ] shows the evolution of the most relevant fit parameters at @xmath25 with @xmath21 for six centrality bins .",
    "systematics errors are still under study .",
    "62 gev results have similar trends as 200 gev .    in order to distinguish the quadrupole signal from @xmath11-localized ( jet - like ) correlations we will fit the major structures in the 2d histograms .",
    "the fitting model used is similar to that used in @xcite , but the sharp peak from electron pairs is excluded rather than fit .",
    "the histograms are constructed with 24 bins on @xmath33 with centers ranging from @xmath34 to @xmath35 in steps of @xmath36 and 25 bins on @xmath37 with centers ranging from @xmath38 to @xmath39 .",
    "a total of seven bins are excluded from the fit , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 and where @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the complete fitting function is then @xmath44 there are 5 terms and 8 parameters .",
    "two of the terms are sinusoids on @xmath45 , one is a constant offset , and one models only structure on @xmath46 .",
    "thus , the remaining term  the two - dimensional gaussian  is solely responsible for describing `` nonflow '' @xcite .    fig .",
    "[ fig : compare ] ( first three panels ) shows measured quadrupole results from this analysis vs. @xmath0 compared to previously published @xmath7 results for 30 - 40% , 5 - 10% and 0 - 5% central collisions . in the case of 0 - 5%",
    "the quadrupole component was found to be too small to measure reliably so the cross - hatched region represents an upper bound .",
    "we calculate the contribution of the 2d gaussian peak to the second fourier component using the measured amplitudes and widths in the curve labeled jets. we find @xmath47 seems to be dominated by the ss peak structure in 5 - 10% collisions and entirely due to it in 0 - 5% collisions .",
    "this has important implications for the interpretation of published @xmath6 data .",
    "consider a model in which the single - particle density on @xmath21 and @xmath5 and corresponding transverse boosts can be decomposed into azimuth - independent @xmath48 and quadrupole @xmath49 pieces @xcite .",
    "define @xmath50 and invoke a blastwave model to get the relation @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the quadrupole component of the radial boost distribution , @xmath49 is the quadrupole spectrum , and @xmath53 is a blastwave parameter . now construct the unit - integral quantity @xmath54 / [ v_2 ( b ) \\langle 1 / p_t \\rangle ] \\approx [ \\rho_2 ( y_t , b ) ] / [ \\rho_2 ( b ) ] $ ] .",
    "most of the parameters drop out and this variable directly relates measurable quantities to the quadrupole spectrum model .",
    "there is little centrality dependence to the quantity @xmath55 .",
    "a single lvy distribution @xmath56 can describe the data within 10% with a few simple parameters : a @xmath21 boost @xmath57 and parameters @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "there is deviation from this curve for very central collisions at low-@xmath0 .",
    "a similar analysis was made in @xcite for minimum - bias identified particles without centrality dependence and the observed boost values agree .",
    "it is notable that the boost is a single sharp value and not a distribution as would be expected from transverse hubble expansion .",
    "a related and more accurate parametrization has been made . at higher",
    "@xmath0 it is observed that @xmath60 is proportional to @xmath61 so we derive the form : @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 is a dimensionless factor necessary for the full @xmath0 and centrality dependence .",
    "it is fit to data to get @xmath65 $ ] and @xmath66 ^ 5 $ ] .",
    "using 2d correlations we observe @xmath3 for a wide range of centralities without significant `` nonflow '' contamination and conclude that published @xmath67 results @xcite contain a significant contribution from the same - side peak correlations .",
    "we have measured the quadrupole on @xmath21 as a function of @xmath68 and deduced the quadrupole spectrum variation with centrality .",
    "this is the first complete factorization of the scaling properties of the quadrupole .",
    "a detailed study of the systematics is in progress .",
    "when the quadrupole spectrum is isolated we also observe a single @xmath68-independent @xmath21 boost value that is consistent with the minimum - bias results for different particle species @xcite .",
    "we developed an accurate parametriazation of @xmath10 over a large kinetic domain and surprisingly simple trends are observed .",
