    "the bbd is the number density of galaxies as a function of both absolute magnitude , @xmath2 , and effective surface brightness , @xmath3 .",
    "this provides a useful framework for removing surface brightness selection effects from the measurement of the space density of galaxies ( cross et al .",
    "2001 ) and also provides useful constraints for testing models of galaxy formation and evolution ( de jong & lacey 2000 ) .",
    "large redshift surveys such as the `` two - degree field galaxy redshift survey '' ( 2dfgrs , colless et al .",
    "2001 ) and the  sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , york et al .",
    "2000 ) provide the quantity of data necessary to select the unbiased , statistically significant samples needed to measure the bbds of different galaxy types .",
    "the 2dfgrs is a @xmath4 redshift survey , containing redshifts for @xmath5 galaxies , with an apparent magnitude limit @xmath6 ( see colless et al .",
    "the input catalogue for the 2dfgrs is based on the automated plate machine ( apm ) catalogue ( maddox et al .",
    "1990 ) , with some recent recalibration using new ccd data .",
    "madgwick et al .",
    "( 2002 ) used the 2dfgrs to identify four spectral classes based on the emission / absorption line strength ( @xmath7 ) of galaxies .",
    "@xmath7-type 1 galaxies have strong absorption lines and @xmath7-type 4 galaxies have strong emission lines .    the millennium galaxy catalogue ( mgc , liske et al .",
    "2002 ) is a @xmath8deg@xmath9 deep ccd imaging survey of an equatorial strip between @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the mgc images were taken through the kpno - b filter on the isaac newton telescope .",
    "the detection isophote @xmath12 mag arcsec@xmath13 and the mean seeing is @xmath14 .",
    "star - galaxy separation has been undertaken by eye for all @xmath15 objects .",
    "for each galaxy we measured half light radii ( @xmath16 ) along the major axis of the ellipse that contains half of the flux of the galaxy .",
    "we use this to calculate the effective surface brightness , @xmath17 , assuming a circular aperture , to correct for inclination effects , see cross et al .",
    "using a mean colour for galaxies @xmath18 , we find that the filter conversion between the apm and mgc is @xmath19 . @xmath20 .",
    "the mean scale error in magnitude is small and linear ( see fig  [ fig:2df_mgc ] ) .",
    "it is fit by the equation @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "however , there is a significant scale error as a function of effective surface brightness ( see fig  [ fig:2df_mgc ] ) .",
    "@xmath24 is constant for @xmath25 but decreases non - linearly with @xmath3 for @xmath26 mag arcsec@xmath13 .",
    "the most likely explanation is non - linearities or saturation of high surface brightness galaxies in the apm .",
    "a comparison between the mgc and the sloan digital sky survey early data release ( sdss - edr ) shows that @xmath27 with no significant scale error .",
    "we select the sample of mgc galaxies which should have 2dfgrs matches to measure the photometric completeness , see cross et al .",
    "the variation of incompleteness with magnitude and with surface brightness is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2df_mgc ] .",
    "the incompleteness is worst at the bright and faint ends , reaching a minimum of @xmath28 in the range @xmath29 .",
    "it increases linearly with magnitude in the range @xmath30 . for @xmath31 , the magnitude limit of the 2dfgrs",
    "affects the measurement of completeness . for @xmath32",
    "the incompleteness is fairly constant @xmath28 .",
    "the incompleteness of low surface brightness galaxies increases rapidly beyond @xmath33 and no 2dfgrs galaxies are seen with @xmath34 , as expected with an isophotal limit @xmath35 . at the high surface brightness end , the incompleteness rises steadily , since small angular size galaxies were mistaken for stars in the apm .",
    "since the 2dfgrs suffers from a non - linearity with surface brightness and @xmath36 photometric incompleteness to @xmath31 , we use the mgc objects defined as galaxies to select the bbd sample .",
    "the selection limits used are : the isophotal limit @xmath37 mag arcsec@xmath13 , the minimum half light radius @xmath38 , defined by the average star - galaxy separation , and the maximum half - light radius @xmath39 , limited by the sky subtraction .",
    "the other limits , @xmath40 are determined by the redshift completeness .",
    "we select a subsample , with @xmath41 redshift completeness at all values of @xmath42 and @xmath3 .",
    "these limits are discussed in cross ( 2002 ) .",
    "we calculate the overall bbd using a maximum likelihood method outlined in cross ( 2002 ) .",
    "it is based on the step - wise method ( efstathiou , ellis & peterson 1988 ) , but also includes visibility theory ( phillipps , davies & disney 1990 ) .",
    "the overall bbd is shown in the first plot of fig  [ fig : bbd ] .",

    "the best fit gives @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 with @xmath50 for @xmath51 degrees of freedom .",
    "the mgc database is too small to produce statistically significant samples to measure the bbd for each spectral type .",
    "instead , we use the mgc to remove the non - linearities in the 2dfgrs magnitudes and to correct for photometric incompleteness and stellar contamination , see cross ( 2002 ) .",
    "this gives a ten times larger dataset , but with larger random errors in the photometry .",
    "the bbds produced for each type are also displayed in fig  [ fig : bbd ] .",
    "we find that @xmath7-type 1 galaxies have a bimodal distribution - a tightly bounded distribution , centred on @xmath52 with a high degree of symmetry and no significant luminosity surface brightness correlation , with a second fainter distribution , which continues upto the selection limits .",
    "in contrast types 2 - 4 show a strong luminosity - surface brightness correlation ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) , which does not vary significantly between these types .",
    "the proportion of faint galaxies increases with @xmath7-type : @xmath7-type 2 galaxies have a flat faint end slope ( @xmath53 ) and @xmath7-type 4 galaxies have a steep faint end slope ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "we have used a deep , wide field ccd survey , the mgc , to show that the 2dfgrs contains a scale error with surface - brightness , due to non - linearities in the photographic plates .",
    "furthermore , the 2dfgrs has a mean photometric incompleteness of @xmath36 , for @xmath55 , with many low surface brightness and low angular resolution galaxies excluded .",
    "the mgc can be used to define a dataset with well understood selection limits that contains ccd photometric data and 2dfgrs spectroscopic data .",
    "we have used this dataset to calculate the bivariate brightness distribution ( bbd ) for the overall galaxy distribution and for four spectral types .",
    "we show that strongly absorbing galaxies ( ellipticals / lenticulars ) form a bimodal population .",
    "the bright , high surface brightness population does not show a strong correlation between magnitude and surface brightness .",
    "@xmath7-type 2 - 4 galaxies ( spirals / irregulars ) all show the same strong correlation between magnitude and surface brightness .",
    "the proportion of dwarf galaxies increases with increasing emission line strength ."
