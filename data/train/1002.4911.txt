    "much of modern harmonic analysis in euclidean spaces depends upon the fact that the lebesgue measure is compatible with the scalar multiplication in the sense that for any ball @xmath1 in @xmath2 we have @xmath3 ; here @xmath4 is the ball with the same centre and twice the radius of @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , many results proved originally in the euclidean setting have been extended to metric spaces endowed with a doubling measure @xmath5 , i.e. , a measure satisfying @xmath6 for some constant @xmath7 depending only upon @xmath5 .",
    "it is a simple matter to verify that the standard gaussian measure @xmath8 on @xmath9 , @xmath10 is non - doubling . in their seminal paper @xcite , mauceri and",
    "meda found a way around this by introducing the class of _ admissible balls_. these are the balls @xmath11 in @xmath2 satisfying the smallness condition @xmath12 mauceri and meda show that admissible balls enjoy a doubling condition .",
    "armed with this , many results from the euclidean case can be carried over to the gaussian case , as long as one is able to work with admissible balls only .",
    "mauceri and meda were thus able to define gaussian counterparts of the spaces @xmath13 and @xmath14 and extend parts of the caldern - zygmund theory to the gaussian setting .",
    "some of these results have even been extended to a more general class of locally doubling metric measure spaces in @xcite .",
    "another important tool of euclidean harmonic analysis is the whitney covering method .",
    "this technique allows one to cover open sets @xmath15 with dyadic cubes whose sizes are proportional to the distance of the cube to the complement of @xmath15 . in the gaussian case ,",
    "one runs into the problem that admissible cubes become very small at large distances from the origin . as a consequence ,",
    "the distance of such a cube to the exterior of a given open set is typically much larger than the size of the cube . at first sight , this renders whitney covering useless as a tool in the gaussian setting .",
    "the purpose of this note is to show how whitney covering , too , can be adapted to the gaussian setting . to illustrate its usefulness , we use it to prove an atomic decomposition theorem and a change of aperture theorem for the gaussian analogue of the tent space @xmath0 of coifman , meyer and stein",
