    "lie 2-groups arise naturally in mathematical physics .",
    "for instance , in higher gauge theory @xcite , lie 2-group bundles provide a well suited framework for describing the parallel transport of strings @xcite .",
    "several recent works have approached the concept of bundles with a `` structure lie 2-group '' over a manifold from various perspectives @xcite . here",
    "we take an alternative point of view and give a definition of principal lie 2-group bundles of a global nature ( i.e. not resorting to a description explicitly involving local charts and cocycles ) and which allows for the base space to be a lie groupoid . in other words , we consider 2-group principal bundles over differentiable stacks @xcite .",
    "our approach immediately leads to a natural construction of `` universal characteristic classes '' for principal 2-group bundles .",
    "let us start with lie ( 1-)groups .",
    "a principal @xmath1-bundle @xmath10 over a manifold @xmath11 canonically determines a homotopy class of maps from @xmath11 to the classifying space @xmath12 of the group @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , the set of isomorphism classes of @xmath1-principal bundles over @xmath11 is in bijection with the set of homotopy classes of maps @xmath13 @xcite . pulling back the generators of @xmath14 ( the universal classes ) through @xmath15 ,",
    "one obtains characteristic classes of the principal bundle @xmath10 over @xmath11 .",
    "these characteristic classes coincide with those obtained from a connection by applying the chern - weil construction @xcite .",
    "there is an analogue but much less known , differential geometric rather than purely topological , point of view : a principal @xmath1-bundle over a manifold @xmath11 can be thought of as a `` generalized morphism '' ( in the sense of hilsum - skandalis @xcite ) from the manifold @xmath11 to the lie group @xmath1 both considered as 1-groupoids . to see this ,",
    "recall that a principal @xmath1-bundle can be defined as a collection of transition functions @xmath16 on the double intersections of some open covering , satisfying the cocycle condition @xmath17 .",
    "these transition functions constitute a morphism of groupoids from the ech groupoid @xmath18 associated to the open covering @xmath19 to the lie group @xmath20 .",
    "hence we have a diagram @xmath21 in the category of lie groupoids and their morphisms whose leftward arrow is a morita equivalence , in other words a generalized morphism from the manifold @xmath11 to the lie group @xmath1 .",
    "this second point of view , or more precisely its generalization to the 2-groupoid context , constitutes the foundations on which our approach is built .",
    "the generalization of the concept of `` generalized morphism '' to 2-groupoids is straightforward : a generalized morphism of lie 2-groupoids @xmath22 is a diagram @xmath23{\\phi}\\bolde\\xto{f}\\bolddelta$ ] in the category @xmath24 of lie 2-groupoids and their morphisms , where @xmath25 is a morita equivalence ( a `` smooth '' equivalence of 2-groupoids ) .",
    "it is sometimes useful to think of two morita equivalent lie 2-groupoids as two different choices of an atlas ( or open cover ) on the same geometric object ( which is a differentiable 2-stack  @xcite ) .",
    "we define a principal @xmath8$]-bundle over a lie groupoid @xmath26 to be a generalized morphism from @xmath26 to @xmath8 $ ] ( up to equivalence ) .",
    "see section  [ s:2bundle ] .",
    "the concept of ( geometric ) nerve of lie groupoids extends to the 2-categorical context as a functor from the category of lie 2-groupoids to the category of simplicial manifolds  @xcite . by convention ,",
    "the cohomology of a 2-groupoid is the cohomology of its nerve , which can be computed via a double complex ( for instance , see  @xcite ) .",
    "crucially , morita equivalences induce isomorphisms in cohomology .",
    "therefore , any generalized morphism of 2-groupoids @xmath27 defining a principal @xmath28$]-bundle @xmath29 over the groupoid @xmath26 yields a pullback homorphism @xmath30 in cohomology , which is called the _ cohomology characteristic map _ ( characteristic map for short ) . the cohomology classes in @xmath31  @xcite should be viewed as universal characteristic classes and their images by @xmath32 as the characteristic classes of @xmath29 .",
    "lie 2-group principal bundles are closely related to non - abelian gerbes .",
    "geometrically , non - abelian @xmath1-gerbes over differentiable stacks can be considered as groupoid @xmath1-extensions modulo morita equivalence @xcite . by a groupoid @xmath1-extension ,",
    "we mean a short exact sequence of groupoids @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is a bundle of groups .",
    "here we establish an explicit 1 - 1 correspondence between groupoid @xmath1-extensions up to morita equivalence ( i.e. @xmath1-gerbes over differentiable stacks ) and principal @xmath0$]-bundles over lie groupoids modulo morita equivalence ( i.e. @xmath0$]-principal bundles over differentiable stacks ) .",
    "this is theorem  [ breengeometric ] .",
    "note that a restricted version of this correspondence is highlighted in @xcite*theorem  4 .",
    "it is known that giraud s second non abelian cohomology group @xmath35 classifies the @xmath1-gerbes over a differentiable stack @xmath36  @xcite while dedeckers @xmath37)$ ] classifies the principal @xmath0$]-bundles @xcite . in @xcite , breen showed that these two cohomology groups are isomorphic . in some sense , our theorem above can be considered as an explicit geometric proof of breen s theorem in the smooth context .",
    "indeed , one of the main motivations behind the present paper is the relation between @xmath1-extensions and 2-group principal bundles .",
    "we believe our result throws a bridge between the groupoid extension approach to the differential geometry of @xmath1-gerbes developed in @xcite and the one based on higher gauge theory due to baez - schreiber @xcite .",
    "this will be investigated somewhere else .    an important class of @xmath1-extensions is formed by the so called _ central @xmath1-extensions _",
    "@xcite , those for which the structure 2-group @xmath38 reduces to the 2-group @xmath39 ( where @xmath40 stands for the center of @xmath1 ) .",
    "they correspond to @xmath1-gerbes with trivial band or @xmath1-bound gerbes @xcite .",
    "each such extension determines a principal @xmath39-bundle over the base groupoid @xmath26 . in @xcite",
    ", behrend - xu gave a natural construction associating a class in @xmath41 to a central @xmath42-extension of a lie groupoid @xmath43 .",
    "when the base lie groupoid is morita equivalent to a smooth manifold ( viewed as a trivial 2-groupoid ) , a central @xmath42-extension is what has been studied by murray and hitchin under the name bundle gerbe @xcite .",
    "the behrend - xu class of a bundle gerbe coincides with its _ dixmier - douady class _ , which can be described by the @xmath44-curvature . in the present paper , we extend the construction of behrend - xu and define a dixmier - douady class @xmath45 for any central @xmath1-extension , where @xmath1 is a connected reductive lie group .",
    "since a central @xmath1-extension induces a @xmath39-principal bundle over @xmath26 , there is also a charateristic map @xmath46 .",
    "dualizing , one obtains a class @xmath47 .",
    "we prove that the dixmier - douady class @xmath48 coincides with the characteristic class @xmath49 . in a certain sense , this is the gerbe analogue of the chern - weil isomorphism for principal bundles @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
