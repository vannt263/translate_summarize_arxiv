    "it is widely accepted that quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is the correct theory for strong interactions .",
    "qcd is a renormalizable quantum field theory which is closely modeled after quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , the most accurate physical theory we have to date .",
    "however , in the low - energy regime , qcd tells us that the interactions between quarks and gluons are strong , so that quark - gluon dynamics becomes non - perturbative in nature .",
    "understanding the structures of hadrons directly from qcd remains an outstanding problem , and there is no indication that it will be solved in the foreseeable future . in 1989 , it was realized that , in low energy situations where the typical gluon momenta are small compared with the heavy quark mass @xmath0 , qcd dynamics becomes independent of the flavor and spin of the heavy quark @xcite . for the heavy flavors ,",
    "this new symmetry called heavy quark symmetry ( hqs ) . of course , even in this infinite heavy quark mass limit , low energy qcd dynamics remains non - perturbative , and what hqs can do for us is to relate otherwise unrelated static and transition properties of heavy hadrons , and hence enormously reduces the complexity of theoretical analysis .",
    "in other words , hqs allows us to factorize the complicated light quark and gluon dynamics from that of the heavy one , and thus provides a clearer physical picture in the study of heavy quark physics . beyond the symmetry limit",
    ", a heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) can be developed by systematically expanding the qcd lagrangian in powers of @xmath1 , with which hqs breaking effects can be studied order by order @xcite .    in the experimental area ,",
    "all masses of @xmath2-wave charmed hadrons and bottomed mesons which containing one heavy quark are found at present .",
    "however , except the particle @xmath3 was already found in the early 1980 s , there has not been significant progress in searching @xmath2-wave bottomed baryons until these months . recently some bottomed baryons were discovered at fermilab .",
    "they are the exotic relatives of the proton and neutron @xmath4 and @xmath5 by cdf collaboration @xcite and the triple - scoop baryon @xmath6 by d0 and cdf collaborations @xcite .",
    "it is reasonable that the remainder particles , which include @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , will be observed in the foreseeable future .",
    "all these heavy hadrons provide a testing ground for hqet with the phenomenological models to the low - energy regime of qcd . in this paper",
    "we focus on one static property , that is , the mass spectrum of heavy hadrons and combine hqet with the known experimental data to predict the mass splitting of some heavy baryons .",

    "in this paper , based on hqet , we have presented a formalism to describe the hyperfine mass splittings of the heavy baryons . furthermore ,",
