    "celestial bodies usually rotate around a certain axis , which in many applications can be taken to nearly coincide with one of the body s principal axes of inertia . in this case , the angular momentum @xmath0 is written as the product of the corresponding moment of inertia @xmath1 and the angular velocity @xmath2 , @xmath3 .",
    "the time derivative of the angular momentum is @xmath4 and thus its time evolution depends not only on the external torques @xmath5 , but also on the time variation of the moment of inertia .",
    "since celestial bodies are not perfect rigid , variations in the moments of inertia can occur due to internal processes or from tidal deformations caused by the gravitational interactions with other bodies .",
    "for example , the gravitational attraction of the moon and the sun can tidally deform the earth and cause variations in its polar moment of inertia @xmath1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "a similar behaviour is observed also for artificial satellites ; flexible components , like antennas and solar panels , for instance , can modify the shape or the mass distribution of the spacecraft and thus can alter the moments of inertia ( @xcite ) .",
    "the rotational dynamics can be studied by using a simplified approach known as the _ spin  orbit model ; one considers a small body , e.g. , a satellite , moving around a primary body on a fixed keplerian ellipse and rotating around an internal axis , which is assumed to be perpendicular to the orbit plane .",
    "moreover , one takes the spin - axis as coinciding with the smallest physical axis .",
    "thus , denoting by @xmath6 the principal moments of inertia , the spin - axis corresponds to @xmath1 .",
    "the time variations in the moment of inertia @xmath7 introduce an angular velocity - dependent term in the equations of motion for the body s rotation and @xmath8 , might also vary in time , say @xmath9 , @xmath10 , but in the present setting this variation does not contribute to eq .",
    "( [ eq : one ] ) , where only the variation of @xmath1 is considered . ] .",
    "_    dissipative terms in general destroy the symplectic structure of the equation of motion describing the spin - orbit model ; the symplectic structure would hold in the presence of solely external gravitational torques in a rigid - body configuration . on the other hand , a symplectic formulation of the equation of motion might be a desirable feature in many theoretical or numerical studies of spin - orbit models .",
    "an example was provided by henrard ( @xcite ) , who proposed a suitable time parametrisation which , in the case of a constant drag force , can map the dissipative system into a hamiltonian one , through a non - canonical transformation .",
    "this idea became the cornerstone of the adiabatic invariant theory that explains the trapping into the resonances of the spin - orbit evolution ( @xcite , @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , this mapping allows us to use the whole suite of formal tools from hamiltonian theory to tackle a system of manifestly non - hamiltonian character in its original formulation .",
    "it is straightforward to see that the idea of the time parametrisation can also be applied in the case of a time varying dissipative term , as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] , thus accounting for variations of the moment of inertia @xmath1 .",
    "given the functional form of these variations , the problem then reduces to a second - order differential equation , the solution of which gives the suitable time parametrisation to map the system into a hamiltonian one .    in the present paper our aim is to develop an algorithmic procedure , based on a series approach , that gives us the time parametrisation in an explicit form in cases more generic than the one considered by henrard in @xcite . in particular , we extend the computation in the cases of a quasi - periodic variation of @xmath1 , as well as the more general case of a dissipative term with both a constant and a quasi - periodic contribution .",
    "we apply our theory to the study of three different applications : i ) the rotational motion of an artificial satellite with flexible components , when the periodic variation in @xmath1 is resonant with the orbital motion , or ii ) when it is non - resonant with the orbital motion , and iii ) the rotational motion of a celestial body under the effect of a constant ( tidal ) and a quasi - periodic dissipation .",
    "these models can be conveniently described by a second order differential equation of the form @xmath11 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : orsystem ] ) below ) , for some analytical functions @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "two main advantages of the method presented here are : i ) the so - computed series lead to an analytical representation of the solution whose accuracy nearly reaches machine precision after only a few iterative steps .",
    "ii ) the same representation allows , via the hamiltonian re - formulation , to use symplectic integrator techniques in order to compute numerically the dynamical evolution of systems whose original formulation is non - hamiltonian .",
    "this , in turn , allows to take benefit of all the advantages associated with the use of symplectic integration techniques , as exposed , e.g. , in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "of course , the trade - off is the need to make symbolic series computations , whose realization , however , exhibits no difficulty with the use of a standard symbolic manipulator .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] we present the theory for the computation of a suitable time parametrisation used to cast a particular class of dissipative systems into a hamiltonian one ; in sec .",
    "[ sec : applications ] we discuss some interesting applications of our method and in sec .",

    "in this section we consider a dynamical system described by the equation    @xmath14    where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 are analytic functions with @xmath12 periodic ; moreover , @xmath12 is assumed to be minus the gradient of a potential function @xmath17 : @xmath18 equation  ( [ eq : orsystem ] ) describes , for example , the rotational motion of a satellite under suitable assumptions , the so - called  spin - orbit \" model ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) and subject to a tidal torque , depending linearly on the velocity or rather admitting a flexible structure , so that the moment of inertia @xmath1 varies with time .",
    "we describe how to obtain a time parametrisation , such that the equations of motion can be associated to a hamiltonian function .",

    "the advantage of this approach is that we can now apply a variety of tools developed in the framework of the hamiltonian theory to formally study the system .",

    "a simple consideration to explain this idea was offered in @xcite .",
    "one notes that the new momentum @xmath28 is time dependent ( eq .  ( [ eq : neweq1 ] ) ) .",
    "thus , the conservation of area in the phase space ( @xmath37 ) corresponds to a time dependent evolution of the area of the phase space ( @xmath38 ) , which , in turn , depends on the form of @xmath39 .",
    "the idea of exploiting the time - dependent mapping of areas in phase space was already discussed in the pioneer work of andronov et .",

    "we will see in the following paragraphs that the selection of the constants plays a crucial role in constructing a reliable scheme . in this simplified example , one can just choose @xmath44 leading to @xmath45 or @xmath46 with this choice one has that @xmath47 at @xmath48 .",
    "the hamiltonian function that models our system in this case takes the form :    @xmath49    notice that in the above formulation the quantity @xmath50 is slowly varying , since @xmath51 , the dissipation constant , is usually a small parameter in astronomical applications .",
    "( [ eq : ham2 ] ) has been used to model a wide variety of physical systems .",
    "for example , it is the core of the adiabatic invariant theory ( @xcite,@xcite ) , that has been used to explain the trapping of bodies into a spin - orbit resonance , namely a commensurability between the period of rotation of the satellite and the period of revolution around the main body .",

    "the algorithmic process can be divided in the five steps described below .",
    "we first introduce a book - keeping parameter @xmath68 ( see @xcite ) , whose presence allows to organize the whole computation in powers of the quantity @xmath68 .",

    "in the first example we let @xmath7 be periodic in resonance with the orbital motion , while in the second example we study the non - resonant case . in the third example we consider the evolution under both the torque from the time varying moment of inertia @xmath1 and a torque due to the third body perturbation of the form @xmath130 with @xmath131 , @xmath51 real constants and @xmath132 , @xmath133 , as motivated by the models of tidal torques in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",

    "@xmath174 the momentum seems to be bounded , while in the case @xmath175 it appears to move more erratically , getting temporarily trapped into particular regions of the phase space . in order to qualitatively describe this feature , we produce a double - section of the system . in this case , similarly to the stroboscopic map , we register the values of ( @xmath177 ) when @xmath178 for comparison , in both cases , we superpose the double section to the usual stroboscopic map in the case of @xmath179 .",

    "the equation of motion takes the form    @xmath181    and it is equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ eq : originalsystem ] ) with @xmath182    the potential function @xmath17 associated with @xmath183 is @xmath184 here , we apply the generalized version of our method , developed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : fulltheory ] , in order to calculate the time parametrisation and we consider a resonant case with @xmath142 .",
    "the first three steps of the procedure are identical to the resonant derivation , but we will keep terms only up to second order in @xmath68 and choose @xmath143 for simplicity : @xmath185      in the next step we compute the time integral as follows : @xmath186 where @xmath187 .      in the last step of the procedure we invert the series @xmath90 to obtain @xmath188 ) .",

    "( [ eq : deqtimepar ] ) ) for a fixed value of @xmath194 and different values of @xmath68 .",
    "it is evident that the behaviour of the analytical series solution is pretty satisfactory and similar to the solution of the resonant case .",

    "[ fig : example3relerror ] we compare the analytical and numerical solutions for a fixed value of @xmath195 and different truncation orders @xmath73 .",

    "[ fig : example3single ] , with the help of a stroboscopic poincar map .",
    "due to form of the dissipative forces , all phase space structures of the conservative model now disappear .",
    "however , by using a colour scale to draw the points in the @xmath201 plane according to the different phases of evolution ( time windows ) , the capture process becomes evident .",
    "in particular , the capture within the separatrix of the 1:1 resonance of the unperturbed system ( @xmath202 ) takes place at a time around @xmath203 , which is in agreement with the evolution of the @xmath2 shown in the first panel .",
    "in this work we considered a model problem which describes the rotational motion of a non - rigid body under non - conservative effects . in particular , we have studied the flexibility of the body , which is modelled through the time variation of the moments of inertia , and the effect of the tidal torque raised by a central body . in the considered examples ,",
    "the equations of motion involve an angular velocity - dependent term that destroys the symplectic structure .",

    "although we lack a formal proof , the results in all three examples indicate that the method converges for all practical purposes and can be applied in real case scenarios .",
    "the main advantage of casting this kind of systems into a hamiltonian form is that we open a window of applying classical knowledge of conservative systems in applications to dissipative cases .",
    "although the model considered in this work is a special one , the described methods can be possibly extended to more general situations .",
    "time varying non - conservative forces appear in many different contexts of physics and astronomy . regarding , in particular , applications in astrodynamics , the methods presented above lend themselves quite conveniently in the study of the tidal dynamics of natural satellites with dissipation ( e.g. with liquid cores or other types of mechanical friction ) , but also of artificial satellites , as for example , the motion under a time varying atmospheric drag , the variable mass problem ( due , e.g. , to fuel consumption ) , or even oscillating solar wind and/or solar radiation pressure effects .",
