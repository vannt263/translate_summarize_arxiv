    "due to the thomson scattering with the presence of quadrapole temperature anisotropy , the cmb becomes linearly polarized during the epoch of recombination . as the cmb propagates through inter - galactic medium and galaxy clusters , there are secondary effects which are imprinted on the cmb temperature anisotropy and polarization properties .",
    "one of such secondary effects is the creation of the circular polarization  ( cp ) in the cmb through the mechanism of faraday conversion  ( fc ) .",
    "the fc can be understood in the following way .",
    "consider a linearly polarized electro - magnetic ( em ) wave in a homogeneous magnetized plasma .",

    "circular polarization of an em wave can be visualized as two linear polarized waves with a phase difference between the linearly polarized components .",
    "charged particles in the plasma are free to move along the magnetic field lines and can respond easily to the electric field of the em wave .",
    "however , the motions of the charged particles perpendicular to the magnetic field lines are affected by the magnetic field and their response to the electric field of the em wave is now modified .",
    "therefore , a difference arises in the particle motions between the two orthogonal polarization directions of the em field , due to the existence of the magnetic field in the plasma .",
    "this difference translates into a phase difference between two linearly polarized components of the em wave parallel and perpendicular to the external magnetic field . as a result",
    ", a circularly polarized wave is generated . in this section , after giving a brief review of the stokes parameters , we formulate the generation of the cp of the cmb due to the fc to obtain the analytic form of the cp angular power spectrum .",
    "first of all , we consider a monochromatic em wave propagating along @xmath26 .",
    "this em wave is characterized by two mutually perpendicular electric field components on the @xmath27-@xmath28 plane . at a given point in space , the amplitude of the electric field vectors pointing along @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively are described by  @xcite @xmath31 the extent of polarization is generally quantified in terms of the so - called stokes parameters @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",

    "the stokes parameters are obtained by the time averaging of the electric field components of the em waves , @xmath40 where the bracket @xmath41 denotes the time averaging with the time interval over which the measurement is performed .    as shown in above equations ,",
    "the @xmath32 parameter represents the intensity of the em waves , the @xmath33 and @xmath34 parameters are associated to the lp of the em waves and the @xmath35 parameter quantifies the extent of the cp . the parameters @xmath32 and @xmath35 are coordinate - independent  ( scalar ) and dimensionless true observables .",

    "we have only considered remnants with t@xmath241=10@xmath242 yrs .",
    "[ fig : clvv - slices ] conveys that @xmath51 decreases with increasing redshift .",
    "this is primarily due to the increase in the number density of pop iii stars in lower redshifts directly due to increase in the number of halos . in this paper , although we do not take into account the redshift dependence of the evolution of pop iii star properties , their properties strongly depend on redshift .",
    "in particular , the metal pollution due to explosions of pop iii stars make mass of pop iii stars small and , finally , the abundance of pop iii stars are dominated by pop ii stars .",

    "in this paper , we have studied the cp signals of the cmb , focusing on the faraday conversion  ( fc ) caused by the sn remnant of the pop iii star explosions . in the sn remnant ,",
    "the relativistic electrons are produced and the magnetic fields are amplified . therefore , during the propagation through the sn remnant , the cmb undergoes fc which transfers some of its linear polarization into circular polarization ( cp ) .    in this paper",
    ", we have derived an analytic form for the angular power spectrum of the cmb cp .",
    "this analytic form is general to the cp due to the fc .",
    "the angular power spectrum is the convolution between the cmb e - mode and the fc rate power spectra .",
    "we have applied this analytic form to estimate the cp of the cmb due to the sn remnants of pop iii stars .",
    "compared with primary e - mode polarization , the amplitude of the produced cp is suppressed by a factor of 10@xmath245 in terms of the angular power spectrum for remnants of the pop iii stars with t@xmath246 yr . the efficiency of the fc strongly depends on the frequency of cmb photons .",
    "we found that the amplitude of the cp angular power spectrum is proportional to @xmath221 .",
    "the signals of the cp fall off with increasing frequency .",
    "as the sn remnant evolution , we adopt the simple analytic model , the sedov similar solution . in this model , as the sn remnant evolves , the number density of relativistic electrons and the amplification of magnetic fields are suppressed .",
    "therefore , the signals of the cp also decrease with the age of the remnant , @xmath110 growing .    throughout this paper , we have assumed that energy of each pop iii explosion is @xmath247 ergs .",
    "however , @xmath109 depends on various properties of pop iii stars and is theoretically uncertain .",
    "however , the produced cp also depends on the energy of the explosion .",
    "the angular power spectrum @xmath51 is roughly proportional to @xmath248 with the spectral index @xmath249 of the relativistic electron distribution . for @xmath222 ,",
    "we retrieve an approximate quadratic dependence of @xmath51 on @xmath109 .",
    "therefore , the detailed energy distribution of pop iii sne is required to predict @xmath0 precisely .",
    "additionally , there exists the theoretical uncertainty on the conversion of the sn energy into the energies of relativistic electrons and magnetic fields , which we parameterize as @xmath125 and @xmath136",
    ". we will address the modeling of these parameters based on simulations in a future work .",
    "we have assumed the direction of the magnetic field generated by their explosions , to be aligned to the @xmath26 axis .",
    "in other words , we have assumed @xmath250 .",
    "if we relax this assumption , and consider a general direction of @xmath106 , we may use @xmath251 according to the equipartition over the all directions . the signal of cp due to only @xmath252",
    "is then suppressed by a factor of 1/9 . in this case , there are additional contribution due @xmath253 and @xmath254 , the components of magnetic field in the @xmath29 and @xmath30 directions",
    ". these contributions could be additive or subtractive and a precise estimate is difficult without a more detailed numerical modeling . in our evaluation of the cmb cp , we ignore the faraday rotation  ( fr ) effect .",
    "the fr arises when the cmb photons pass through a magnetised plasma .",
    "therefore , when the fc of the cmb occurs , the fr is also expected to be effective . since the fr rotates the direction of the linear polarization , the relative angle between the linear polarization and the magnetic fields changes .",
    "even more , when the fr is efficient , it might be change the sign of the cp due to the fc .",
    "therefore the magnitude and sign of the final cp might depend on the details of the fr in the system .",
    "although the fr due to magnetic fields in intergalactic medium , galaxy clusters and the milky way has been studied  ( e.g.  @xcite ) , the fr of the cmb in sn remnants of pop iii stars has not been addressed yet . in order to evaluate the effect of sn remnants on the cmb linear and circular polarization , it is required to study the fr and fc consistently .",
    "we propose to investigate this detail in the future .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the signals of the cmb cp due to the propagation through galaxy clusters are predicted that the peak amplitude is @xmath255  ( @xmath162k)@xmath3 at @xmath256 for @xmath257ghz .",
    "our predicted signals due to the pop iii stars with @xmath258  yr can dominate these signals .",
    "although the signals due to the pop iii stars with @xmath259  yr are comparable with these signals around @xmath260 , these can dominate the signals from galaxy clusters on the smaller scales . even with @xmath261  yr , the signals from the pop iii sne would dominate the ones from galaxy clusters at @xmath262 .",
    "therefore , the pop iii sne can contribute the cmb cp significantly , in particular , on small scales @xmath263 .",
    "we propose that if the future cmb experiments are equipped with cp measuring instruments , the cmb observation can also be used as a probe of the pop iii stars .",
    "in addition to the @xmath264 correlations , @xmath265 and @xmath266 correlations are expected to be higher , leading up to a better detection prospect .",
    "an unique frequency signature of the cp signal due to the fc and absence of any significant foreground makes cp signal to be a promising probe of the pop iii stars , which are yet unobserved .",
