    "the wealth of data recorded at the lhc experiments in run  1 presents an excellent opportunity to test quantum chromo - dynamics ( qcd ) in a new energy regime .",
    "furthermore , multi - jet production at large transverse momentum can provide useful information to constrain the parton distribution functions .",
    "where precise theoretical results are available , the data can also be used to determine the strong coupling constant @xmath1 . in that context",
    "large multiplicities may turn out to be particularly useful , in analogy to what has been observed in electron - positron annihilation .",
    "pure qcd reactions with multiple jet production can also give large backgrounds to various new physics searches therefore precision predictions are required .",
    "next - to - leading order ( nlo ) predictions at fixed order in @xmath1 for di - jet production have been known for more than 20  years @xcite .",
    "three - jet production represents a considerable increase in computational complexity and a full computation was completed in 2002 @xcite , and implemented in the public code nlojet++ , though pure gluonic contributions were known previously @xcite .",
    "breakthroughs in virtual amplitude computations have recently enabled predictions of four - jet production @xcite , with results generally in good agreement with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "di - jet production is known to suffer from large corrections from soft gluon radiation which requires resummation beyond fixed order perturbation theory .",
    "theoretical predictions at nlo including the parton shower ( nlo+ps ) allow to account for these effects and obtain a better description of the available data @xcite .",
    "the cms collaboration has recently completed a measurement of @xmath0 from the inclusive 3-jet to inclusive 2-jet ratio .",
    "the measurement illustrates well the lhc potential for precision measurements . with nnlo qcd corrections to di - jet production just around the corner @xcite",
    ", theoretical uncertainties look to be under good control and enable future qcd predictions to move beyond the ` industry standard ' lo+ps / me+ps accuracy .    by",
    "now there has been a great success of the program to automate nlo computations .",
    "processes with four or five final state particles , previously thought to be impossible , are now available in public codes @xcite .",
    "new methods and algorithms @xcite have been pushing the boundaries of perturbative qcd computations and increasing the range of phenomenological applications ( recent examples can be found in @xcite , see also @xcite for a more complete overview ) .",
    "powerful on - shell unitarity methods have been established for many years @xcite yet continue to demonstrate the ability to simplify calculations of extremely high multiplicity amplitudes inaccessible with alternative tools .",
    "recent state - of - the - art computations include the nlo qcd corrections to @xmath2 jets @xcite by the blackhat collaboration . in this paper",
    "we present the first computation for the production of five hard jets at nlo in qcd .",
    "the article is organized as follows : we first give an overview of the computational framework for the various partonic sub - channels in section [ sec : calc ] .",
    "section [ sec:5j ] contains our results for the nlo qcd corrections to @xmath3 jets .",
    "we describe the numerical setup and interface with the sherpa monte - carlo event generator @xcite in section [ sec : numsetup ] along with kinematic cuts .",
    "results for total cross sections and jet ratios are compared to the available data in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "we present differential distributions in the jet transverse momenta and rapidity and perform a detailed comparison of different pdf fits .",
    "we finally present our conclusions and outlook for the future .",
    "two appendices containing a complete set of distributions and numerical values used in the plotted histograms are included to ease future comparisons .",
    "the calculation is done in qcd with five massless quark flavours including the bottom - quark in the initial state .",
    "we expect the neglected contributions from top quark loops to be much smaller than the estimated theoretical uncertainty .",
    "the processes contributing to five - jet production may be derived from the following four basic channels via crossing symmetry @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote generic quarks of different flavour .",
    "amplitudes with like - flavour quark pairs can always be obtained from the amplitudes for different flavours by an appropriate ( anti ) symmetrization .",
    "the @xmath8-jet differential cross section expanded in the coupling @xmath1 reads @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in",
    "the qcd improved parton model , the leading order differential cross section @xmath12 is given by @xmath13 @xmath14 are the momenta of the two incoming hadrons @xmath15 which we assume to be massless .",
    "the total incoming momentum of the initial state partons @xmath16 leads to a partonic centre - of - mass energy squared @xmath17 with @xmath18 being the hadronic centre - of - mass energy squared .",
    "the parton distribution functions @xmath19 describe , roughly speaking , the probability to find a parton @xmath20 inside a hadron @xmath21 with a momentum fraction between @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "note that the parton distribution functions depend besides @xmath22 also on the unphysical factorization scale .",
    "the partonic differential cross section @xmath24 describes the reaction @xmath25 in born approximation using the leading order matrix elements @xmath26 and a suitable jet algorithm @xmath27 : @xmath28 @xmath29 are the four momenta of the outgoing partons obeying @xmath30 .",
    "the jet algorithm @xmath27 is a function depending solely on the final state parton momenta @xmath29 and on parameters defining the geometric extensions of the jet .",
    "its value is equal to one if the final state momentum configuration corresponds to a valid @xmath8-jet event and zero otherwise .",
    "the born matrix elements @xmath31 have been evaluated with comix @xcite within the sherpa framework .",
    "the sherpa monte carlo event generator @xcite has also been used to perform the numerical phase space integration .    at nlo accuracy both the virtual corrections @xmath32 ( one - loop contribution interfered with the born amplitude ) and the real corrections @xmath33 ( tree - level amplitudes with one additional parton in the final state ) contribute to the @xmath8-jet cross section .",
    "both @xmath32 and @xmath33 contain separately collinear and soft divergences . only after combining the two contributions and factorizing the initial state singularities into renormalized parton distributions one obtains a finite result . in order to perform the cancellation of the divergences",
    "numerically we apply the catani - seymour subtraction method @xcite .",
    "the idea is to add and subtract local counter - terms @xmath34 with @xmath35-parton kinematics which , on the one hand , mimic point - wise the singularity structure of the real corrections and which , on the other hand , are chosen such that the singularity due to the additional parton emission can be calculated analytically via separate integration of the one - particle phase - space .",
    "since the latter cancel by construction the divergences from the virtual corrections , only finite quantities remain making the numerical integration with a monte carlo program feasible .",
    "schematically , we may write the total cross section as @xmath36 @xmath37 is due to the factorization of initial state singularities .",
    "the nlo corrections can then be written in terms of three finite contributions : @xmath38 @xmath39 denotes the finite part of the virtual corrections , @xmath40 the finite part of the integrated subtraction terms together with the contribution from the factorization and @xmath41 the real corrections combined with the subtraction terms . for the computation of @xmath40 and @xmath42 we use",
    "sherpa which provides a numerical implementation of the catani - seymour subtraction scheme .",
    "the required tree - level amplitudes are , as in the lo case , computed with comix as part of the sherpa framework .",
    "the necessary one - loop matrix elements for the virtual corrections @xmath39 are evaluated with the publicly available njet package @xcite .",
    "njetuses an on - shell generalized unitarity framework @xcite to compute multi - parton one - loop primitive amplitudes from tree - level building blocks .",
    "an accurate numerical implementation is achieved using the integrand reduction procedure of opp @xcite .",
    "the algorithm is based on the ngluonlibrary @xcite following the description of @xmath43-dimensional generalized unitarity presented in refs . @xcite and using berends - giele recursion @xcite for efficient numerical evaluation of tree - level amplitudes . for a more detailed description of the employed methods and the usage of the program",
    ", we refer to refs .",
    "the scalar loop integrals are obtained via the qcdloop / ff package @xcite .",
    "we note that njetis so far the only publicly available tool that is able to compute all one - loop seven - point matrix - elements that contribute to five - jet production in hadronic collisions . for reference",
    "numerical evaluations of the one - loop matrix elements at a single phase - space point have been presented previously @xcite .",
    "as mentioned earlier we use the sherpa monte - carlo event generator @xcite to handle phase - space integration and generation of tree - level and catani - seymour dipole subtraction terms using the colour dressed formalism implemented in comix @xcite .",
    "the virtual matrix elements are interfaced using the binoth les houches accord @xcite .    to combine partons into jets we use the anti - kt jet clustering algorithm as implemented in fastjet @xcite .",
    "furthermore asymmetric cuts on the jets ordered in transverse momenta , @xmath44 , are applied to match the atlas multi - jet measurements @xcite : @xmath45      generated events are stored in root ntuple format @xcite which allows for flexible analysis .",
    "renormalization and factorization dependence can be re - weighted at the analysis level as well as the choice of pdf set .",
    "since the event generation of high multiplicity processes at nlo is computationally intensive analysis of pdf uncertainties and scale choices would be prohibitive without this technique .      in this section",
    "we present the numerical results for total cross sections and selected distributions at centre - of - mass energies of 7 and 8 tev . within the setup described in the previous section we have chosen the renormalization and factorization scales to be equal @xmath48 and use a dynamical scale based on the total transverse momentum @xmath49 of the final state partons : @xmath50 we",
