    "corresponding to the facial subsets @xmath28 of @xmath0 @xcite .    often , the existence of special solutions to a system of equations imposes additional structure on the data ( see for example a recent preprint @xcite of beukers on algebraic a - hypergeometric functions . ) in this paper we are interested in the constraints imposed on @xmath0 by the existence of rational @xmath0-hypergeometric functions .",

    "let us briefly outline the strategy for proving theorem  [ th : conj ] .",
    "the fact that an @xmath0-hypergeometric function @xmath69 of degree @xmath13 satisfies @xmath11 independent homogeneity relations , one for each row of the matrix @xmath0 , implies that the study of codimension - two rational @xmath0-hypergeometric functions may be reduced to the study of rational power series in two variables whose coefficients satisfy certain recurrence relations .",
    "now , it follows easily from the one - variable residue theorem that the _ diagonals _ of a rational bivariate power series define algebraic one - variable functions . on the other hand , coming from an @xmath0-hypergeometric function , these univariate functions are classical one - variable hypergeometric functions .",
    "theorem  [ notalgebraic ] allows us to reduce the study of these one - variable functions to those studied by beukers - heckman @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . analyzing the possible functions arising as diagonals of a bivariate rational function leads us to conclude that @xmath0 must be affinely equivalent to an essential cayley configuration or a lawrence configuration .    in the latter case ,",
    "the stable rational @xmath0-hypergeometric functions have been studied in @xcite where it is shown that an appropriate derivative of such a function may be represented by a multivariate residue . in  [ sec : residues ] we show that a similar result holds for essential cayley configurations of codimension two . after recalling the construction of rational @xmath0-hypergeometric functions by means of toric residues , we show in theorem  [ th : dim1 ] ,",
    "that if the parameter @xmath13 lies in the so - called euler - jacobi cone @xmath70 ( see ) , the space of rational @xmath0-hypergeometric function of degree @xmath13 is one - dimensional .",
    "this proves ( * ? ? ?",
    "* conjecture  5.7 ) for any codimension - two essential cayley configuration .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : rat - bivariate ] we apply our results to study the rationality of classical bivariate hypergeometric series ( in the sense of horn , see definition  [ def : horn ] and remark  [ rem : horn ] ) .",
    "theorem  [ th : conjclassic ] shows that any bivariate taylor series whose coefficients are quotients of factorials of integer linear forms as in defines a rational function only if the linear forms arise from a lawrence or cayley essential configuration .",
    "we end up by considering the case of horn series supported in the first quadrant .",
