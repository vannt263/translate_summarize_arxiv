    ", one needs to know the moment of inertia of the neutron star and the spin parameter of the black hole in addition to their masses , orbital parameters and the spin period of the neutron star .",
    "the value of the moment of inertia of a neutron star of known mass depends upon the equation of state of the matter , which is not very well constrained at present .",
    "we choose the values of the moment of inertia as @xmath138 , @xmath139 , and @xmath140 respectively for neutron stars of masses 1.0 , 1.4 and 2.0 @xmath141 according to the predictions of most of the standard equations of state @xcite .",
    "first , we compare the spin - orbit coupling due to the neutron star with that due to the black hole by computing the ratio @xmath142 [ eq : ratios ] this ratio is independent of @xmath71 and @xmath69 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : nstobhsocompare ] , we plot @xmath143 against @xmath144 for the same nsbh binary for different values of @xmath145 .",
    "here we use the limit @xmath146 as given by @xcite .",
    "it is clear that usually the effect due to the spin of the black hole dominates , i.e. @xmath147 , unless either the neutron star is rotating very fast or the black hole is rotating very slowly . as some examples , to get @xmath148 , @xmath149 must be less than @xmath150 for @xmath151 ms , @xmath149 must be less than @xmath152 for @xmath153 ms , and @xmath149 must be less than @xmath154 for @xmath155 ms .    now , to answer the question whether the total spin - orbit coupling effect is comparable to 1pn effect , we compute the value of @xmath156 where we replace @xmath116 by @xmath132 and @xmath123 by @xmath134 in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : k_so1pn ] ) .",
    "we plot @xmath156 against orbital periods and orbital eccentricities for the same nsbh binary in fig .",
    "[ fig : soto1pncomp ] .",
    "as expected , @xmath156 increases as either the black hole or the neutron star or both become faster .",
    "@xmath156 increases with the increase of @xmath69 and decreases with the increase of @xmath71 provided all other parameters are unchanged .",
    "it is clear that usually @xmath157 unless the black hole is rotating very slowly , e.g. for @xmath158 , the whole @xmath159 space has @xmath157 for both @xmath160 s and @xmath161 s ( even for @xmath162 s which has not been shown in the figure ) . for @xmath163 , a significant portion of @xmath159 space",
    "has @xmath164 when @xmath160 s , but for @xmath161 s only the region with high @xmath71 and small @xmath69 has @xmath164 .",
    "these facts imply that @xmath165 term might have significant contribution to the observed @xmath15 for an nsbh binary depending on the spin and orbital parameters of the system .",
    "but here we have assumed that the spin vectors of both the black hole and the neutron star are aligned with the orbital angular momentum vector . in reality",
    ", they can be misaligned , specially if the nsbh system was formed through an exchange interaction .",
    "for some specific orientations of the spin vectors , combined with appropriate values of other relevant parameters , @xmath165 can be very small and even zero .",
    "but as only a small window in the total phase - space can lead to this situation , we consider this situation to be unlikely , although not impossible .    in general",
    ", @xmath156 is not so high that we should expect the non - leading order of the spin - orbit coupling to be effective . as an extreme example , let us consider the nsbh system to have @xmath166 hours , @xmath167 , @xmath168 , and @xmath169 ms , giving @xmath170 .",
    "if we assume that lo - so/1pn @xmath171 nlo - so / lo - so , then nlo - so/1pn becomes @xmath172 . in this case",
    ", the non - leading order would contribute to the observed value of @xmath15 .",
    "but this set of parameters is not very likely , most of the parameter space would probably lead to nlo - so/1pn @xmath173 .",
    "further exploration is needed before making any strong statement , which is beyond the scope of this paper due to the lack of the analytical expression for @xmath174 .",
    "so far , we have displayed the results only for a sample nsbh binary with the neutron star of mass @xmath175 and the black hole of mass @xmath176 except for the variation of @xmath4 with @xmath30 .",
    "this choice of the mass of the black hole may seem to be rather high as @xcite found that the masses of the known black holes in low mass x - ray binaries have a narrow distribution at @xmath177 , population synthesis for nsbh binaries by @xcite also predicted the mean mass of the black holes to be around @xmath178 .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite found that the inclusion of high mass systems resulted the mean of the masses of known black holes to be 10 - 11 @xmath141 .",
    "@xcite used the black hole mass to be @xmath179 in their study of the exchange scenario .",
    "moreover , the higher value of the mass of the black hole makes the system more relativistic .",
    "nevertheless , we have checked that our main conclusions remain unchanged for realistic ranges of the masses , i.e. the neutron star mass in the range of 1 - 2 @xmath141 and the black hole mass in the range of 5 - 15 @xmath141 .",
    "we have already seen that , @xmath4 is always around 1.2 for the above ranges of masses .",
    "the effects of the variation of the mass of the neutron star on @xmath180 , @xmath143 and @xmath156 are insignificant , but the variation of the mass of the black hole has small but significant effects . as an example , for @xmath181 , @xmath182 hours , @xmath183 ,",
    "the values of @xmath180 are @xmath184 , @xmath185 , and @xmath186 for @xmath187 respectively .",
    "the fact that the phase - space for @xmath188 is unphysical , is always true , and thus our main conclusion that @xmath189 remains unaltered .",
    "similarly , the maximum value of @xmath143 in fig .",
    "[ fig : nstobhsocompare ] is 41 where @xmath162 s and @xmath190 for @xmath191 , which becomes 87 if @xmath192 and 27 if @xmath193 keeping @xmath144 and @xmath145 fixed . the minimum value of @xmath143 in fig .",

    "we have considered only the short period nsbh binaries , although very wide ( @xmath202 days ) nsbh systems can also form @xcite .",
    "we have excluded such wide systems from our study as it is clear that higher order effects would be negligible for such systems . for compact nsbh systems , our chosen ranges for @xmath71 and @xmath69 are sufficiently wide to incorporate different formation scenarios , e.g. normal evolutionary formation and the formation through exchange interactions .",
    "the same logic applies for the choice of wide ranges for @xmath144 and @xmath149 .",
    "in this study we have not discussed the effect of the spin - spin interaction . according to @xcite ,",
    "spin - spin interaction is significantly smaller than 2pn effect , and can be neglected .",
    "five post - keplerian parameters can be measured for a relativistic binary , the rate of the advance of the periastron ( @xmath15 ) , the rate of change of the orbital period ( @xmath203 ) , einstein delay parameter ( @xmath204 ) , shapiro range parameter ( @xmath205 ) , and shapiro shape parameter ( @xmath206 ) @xcite .",
    "we have discussed @xmath15 in details , and briefly mentioned about 1pn @xmath203 .",
    "other effects might also contribute significantly to the observed value of @xmath203 , like the tail effect and the spin - orbit coupling as discussed by @xcite .",
    "another interesting hypothesis is the outspiral of the nsbh binary due to the evaporation of the black hole caused by the extra spatial dimensions . according to @xcite",
    ", this effect will be measurable for an nsbh binary and will test the validity of extra dimensions .",
    "lowest order values of @xmath204 and @xmath205 for an nsbh system having @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath86 hours and @xmath87 are @xmath207 s and @xmath208 s. these are orders of magnitude higher than those for j0737 - 3039 @xcite .",
    "so it might be worth exploring higher order effects for these parameters in case of nsbh binaries .",
    "in addition to contributing to the periastron advance , spin - orbit coupling also leads to the geodetic precession where both spin vectors precess around the total angular momentum of the system causing changes in the pulse profile .",
    "this effect has been observed for some relativistic systems @xcite",
    ". the predicted rate of precession upto the leading order @xcite for an nsbh binary having @xmath209 , @xmath210 , @xmath86 hours , and @xmath211 is @xmath212 , which is of the same order as expected from dns systems , e.g. smaller than that of psr j0737 - 3039 ( @xmath213 ) , but larger than psr b1913 + 16 ( @xmath214 ) .",
    "this precession contributes to the observed change in the projected semi - major axis ( @xmath215 ) and the eccentricity @xcite .",
    "this change in @xmath30 is an addition to the possible change caused through the change of @xmath113 caused directly by the spin - orbit coupling ( eqn .",
    "5.15 of ds88 ) .",
    "several other manifestations of general relativity are effective in case of nsbh binaries , like frame - dragging effect @xcite and tidal interaction , etc .",
    "study of these effects was not the aim of this paper .",
    "in this work , we have shown that the 2pn and the leading order spin - orbit coupling terms can have significant contributions to the observed value of the periastron advance of an nsbh binary , while the 3pn and higher order terms can be neglected .",
    "it will not be difficult to incorporate @xmath216 term in the future timing code , as this has a relatively simpler form .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath165 might be difficult to incorporate as it involves few difficult - to - know terms like the moment of inertia of the neutron star , spin of the black hole and orientations of the vectors .",
    "moreover , higher order terms will be important for modelling gravitational wave emission from such systems .",
    "so further theoretical study in this field is necessary before the discovery of the first nsbh binary .",
