    "molybdenum disulphide ( mos@xmath0 ) is a semiconductor with a bulk band gap of about 1.2  ev,@xcite which can be further manipulated by reducing its thickness to monolayer , two - dimensional form.@xcite this finite band gap is a key reason for the excitement surrounding mos@xmath0 as compared to another two - dimensional material , graphene , as graphene is well - known to be gapless.@xcite because of its direct band gap and also its properties as a lubricant , mos@xmath0 has attracted considerable attention in recent years.@xcite although graphene intrinsically has zero band gap , it is the strongest material in the nature with young s modulus above 1.0  tpa.@xcite furthermore , graphene possesses a superior thermal conductivity that may be useful in removing heat from electronic devices.@xcite    the key point from the above discussion is that mos@xmath0 and graphene have complementary physical properties .",
    "therefore , it is natural to investigate the possibility of combining graphene and mos@xmath0 in specific ways to create heterostructures that mitigate the negative properties of each individual constituent.@xcite for example , graphene / mos@xmath0/graphene ( gmg ) heterostructures have better photon absorption and electron - hole creation properties , because of the enhanced light - matter interactions by the single - layer mos@xmath0.@xcite another experiment recently showed that mos@xmath0 can be protected from radiation damage by coating it with graphene layers , which is a design that exploits the outstanding mechanical properties of graphene.@xcite although experimentalists have shown great interest in the mechanical properties of gmg heterostructures , the corresponding theoretical efforts have been quite limited until now .    therefore , the objective of the present work is to present an initial theoretical investigation of the mechanical properties of gmg heterostructures .",
    "we perform classical molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations to comparatively study the mechanical properties of single - layer mos@xmath0 and the gmg heterostructure .",
    "we first point out a spontaneous strain energy arising at the mos@xmath0/graphene interface , which results from the mismatch between the lattice constants of mos@xmath0 and graphene .",
    "we find that the young s modulus of mos@xmath0 can be greatly increased by sandwiching it between two outer graphene layers .",
    "however , our simulations also illustrate that the yield strain in the mos@xmath0 is reduced significantly due to buckling of the outer graphene layers .",
    "all md simulations in this work were performed using the publicly available simulation code lammps  @xcite , while the ovito package was used for visualization  @xcite .",
    "the standard newton equations of motion were integrated in time using the velocity verlet algorithm with a time step of 1  fs .",
    "periodic boundary conditions were applied in the two in - plane directions , while free boundary conditions were applied in the out - of - plane direction .",
    "the structure is uniaxially stretched with a strain rate of @xmath1  s@xmath2 , which is a typical value in md simulations as shown in previous works .",
    "@xcite    the mos@xmath0 interatomic interactions are described by a recently developed stillinger - weber potential,@xcite while the carbon - carbon interactions are described by the second generation brenner ( rebo - ii ) potential  @xcite .",
    "the mos@xmath0 and graphene layers in the gmg heterostructure are coupled by van der waals interactions , which are described by the lennard - jones potential .",
    "the energy and distance parameters in the lennard - jones potential are @xmath3=3.95  mev and @xmath4=3.625   , while the cutoff is 10.0   .",
    "these potential parameters are determined by fitting to the interlayer spacing and the binding energy between a single - layer of mos@xmath0 and a single - layer of graphene .",
    "[ fig_binding_energy_per_carbon ] shows the energy vs. interlayer spacing between mos@xmath0 and graphene .",
    "the potential energy minimum is found at the interlayer spacing of 3.63   , with a corresponding binding energy of -22.357  mev .",
    "these two values are very close to the first - principle predictions around -21.0  mev and 3.66   in ref .  , or -23.0  mev and 3.32   in ref .  .",
    "[ fig_binding_energy_per_carbon ] inset shows the top view of the gmg heterostructure .",
    "hence , the dimension of the supercell is @xmath5   . therefore , an ideal super lattice ( without spontaneous strain ) can be constructed if the heterostructure is obtained by duplicating the supercell in the two - dimensional plane .",
    "however , some mechanical strain will be introduced in the heterostruce , if its dimension is not exactly an integer times the supercell . in this situation ,",
    "one atomic layer is stretched while its neighboring layer will be compressed , so that these two neighboring layers become the same size .",
    "we refer to this strain energy as the spontaneous intrinsic strain energy in the heterostructure .",
    "[ fig_intrinsic_strain_energy ] shows the length dependence for the spontaneous intrinsic strain energy in the gm heterostructure with a fixed width of 12.48   , which is exactly the width of the supercell .",
    "the spontaneous intrinsic strain energy density ( @xmath6 ) in the figure is calculated by following equation,@xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the area of the gm interface and @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are the potential energies in the gm heterostructure , single - layer graphene , and the single - layer mos@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "the van der waals interaction between the graphene and the mos@xmath0 is not included in this calculation , so that the resulted value is purely the strain energy stored in the graphene or mos@xmath0 layer .",
    "the spontaneous intrinsic strain energy is zero at the two boundaries with @xmath12 and 43.22   .",
    "these value are one or two times the supercell size shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig_binding_energy_per_carbon ] .",
    "it confirms that there is indeed no strain energy for the ideal gm heterostructure .",
    "the spontaneous intrinsic strain energy reaches a maximum value in the heterostructure with length around one and half times the supercell size .",
    "having established the supercell dimensions , we now continue to perform a comparative study on the mechanical behavior of single - layer mos@xmath0 and the gmg heterostructure of dimension @xmath13   under uniaxial tension .",
    "there are @xmath14 supercells in the gmg heterostructure , so there is no spontaneous intrinsic strain energy in this examined structure . during the tensile loading of the heterostructure ,",
    "both graphene and mos@xmath0 layers are stretched simultaneously .",
    "we first compare the young s modulus in the single - layer mos@xmath0 and the gmg heterostructure .",
    "[ fig_stress_strain ] shows the stress - strain relationship in these two systems at three temperatures 1.0  k , 50.0  k , and 300.0  k. the strength enhancement is due to the high strength of single - layer graphene , whose young s modulus is around 1.0  tpa.@xcite the young s modulus ( @xmath15 ) of the gmg heterostructure can be predicted by the following rule of mixtures based on the arithmetic average,@xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are the young s modulus for gmg heterostructure , graphene , and mos@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "@xmath20 is the volume fraction for the two outer graphene layers in the gmg heterostructure , and is the volume fraction for the inner mos@xmath0 layer . in our simulations ,",
    "the room temperature young s modulus are 859.69  gpa for graphene and 128.75  gpa for mos@xmath0 . from this mixing rule ,",
    "the upper - bound young s modulus of the gmg heterostructure is 511.76  gpa .",
    "the young s modulus for the gmg heterostructure at room temperature is 556.33  gpa , which is higher than the value predicted by the mixing rule because of the interlayer van der waals interaction between graphene and mos@xmath0 layers in the gmg heterostructure .",
    "an interesting mechanical response is that of a structural transition that occurs in both single - layer mos@xmath0 and the gmg heterostructure .",
    "[ fig_stress_strain ]  ( a ) shows a step - like jump around @xmath21 in the stress - strain curve for single - layer mos@xmath0 , which is due to a structural transition involving a relative shift of the two outer s atomic layers , and which is related to the semiconductor - metallic phase transition in the single - layer mos@xmath0.@xcite fig .",
    "[ fig_cfg_mos2 ] clearly demonstrates the relative shift of the outer s atomic layers during the structural transition .",
    "this step - like jump becomes smoother at higher temperatures as shown in panels ( b ) and ( c ) because the outer two s atomic layers are already exhibiting larger and more frequent oscillations at higher temperature before the structural transition occurs . as a result ,",
    "the influence introduced by the structural transition is overtaken by the thermal vibration in the stress - strain curve .",
    "[ fig_cfg_gmg ] shows that the same structural transition happens in the mos@xmath0 layer sandwiched between two graphene layers .",
    "however , it happens that these two graphene layers yield at almost the same mechanical strain , so the step - like jump is concealed in the stress - strain curve for the gmg heterostructure .",
    "instead , the stress in the heterostructure increases rapidly with increasing strain around @xmath21 , disclosing the yielding phenomenon of the outer two graphene layers .",
    "we now compare the difference in the ultimate strain of single - layer mos@xmath0 and the gmg heterostructure .",
    "[ fig_stress_strain ]  ( a ) shows that the ultimate strain in single - layer mos@xmath0 is around 0.4 . fig .",
    "[ fig_cfg_gmg2 ] displays the configuration for the gmg heterostructure during mechanical tension with strain close to the gmg ultimate strain @xmath22 .",
    "these snapshots illustrate that the gmg heterostructure is compressed in the y direction when it is stretched in the x direction under external mechanical tension ,    fig .",
    "[ fig_temperature ] compares the young s modulus in single - layer mos@xmath0 and the gmg heterostructure at different temperatures . fig .",
    "[ fig_temperature ]  ( a ) shows that the young s modulus in the heterostructure is over 500.0  gpa , which is much higher than the pure mos@xmath0 layer . fig .",
    "[ fig_temperature ]  ( b ) shows that the ultimate strain is reduced after the mos@xmath0 is sandwiched by two graphene layers . in both systems , the ultimate strain decreases with increasing temperature due to stronger thermal vibrations at higher temperature .",
    "to summarize , we have performed classic molecular dynamics simulations to comparatively investigate the mechanical properties of single - layer mos@xmath0 and the gmg heterostructure .",
    "we find that that the lattice mismatch between mos@xmath0 and graphene will result in an spontaneous intrinsic strain energy in the heterostructure .",
    "our study shows that the gmg heterostructure exhibits a young s modulus that is about three times that of single layer mos@xmath0 , while correspondingly exhibiting a yield strain that is about 30 - 40% smaller than that of single layer mos@xmath0 .",
