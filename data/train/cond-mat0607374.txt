    "recently , the su@xmath0-symmetric generalization of the standard su(2 ) hubbard model@xcite has been intensively studied theoretically,@xcite since this model may mimic strongly correlated electron systems where the orbital degrees of freedom of @xmath9 and @xmath10 electrons play important role .",
    "although the standard su(2 ) hubbard model is exactly solvable in one dimension@xcite by bethe s ansatz and is well known to exhibit  at half filling  a mott transition at @xmath6 , no such rigorous statement could be formulated for higher @xmath7 values .",
    "it is expected , however , that at generic fillings the one - dimensional su(@xmath7 ) hubbard model behaves like an @xmath7-component luttinger liquid while gaps may be generated at special fillings of the band , namely at half filling or @xmath3 filling .",
    "the one - dimensional half - filled su(@xmath7 ) hubbard model has been studied@xcite in the large @xmath7 limit and it has been shown that the charge and spin modes  that are decoupled for @xmath11become coupled and gap is generated in all of them . moreover",
    ", it has been found that the system is spontaneously dimerized if @xmath7 is even .",
    "the role of umklapp processes in the half - filled model has been studied@xcite by the analytic multiplicative renormalization - group method in fermionic representation , too .",
    "it has been shown that in fact the umklapp processes couple the spin and charge modes if @xmath12 and the spectrum is fully gapped for arbitrary values of the coulomb repulsion .",
    "the question of dimerization has not been addressed in that work .",
    "the @xmath3-filled case has been investigated@xcite analytically using the bosonized version of the model and numerically with quantum monte carlo simulation .",
    "it has been shown that at this special filling , i.e. , when the number of particles is equal to the number of sites , the spin and charge degrees of freedom are decoupled and gap opens in the charge mode only .",
    "the spin modes remain gapless .",
    "furthermore , it was inferred from the numerical calculations that for @xmath5 , unlike in the @xmath11 case , the charge gap opens at a finite positive @xmath13 . for smaller positive @xmath4 values",
    "the system shows metallic behavior . since the contributions of the leading umklapp processes for commensurate fillings  except for half",
    "filling  are not logarithmically divergent , the special case of @xmath3 filling for @xmath12 could not be analyzed in the framework of the usual analytic renormalization - group procedure .    in this paper , we present a careful numerical analysis of the one - dimensional su@xmath0-symmetric hubbard model for @xmath1 , and 5 using the density - matrix renormalization - group ( dmrg ) method.@xcite besides the question where the mott transition takes place in the @xmath3-filled model we will consider the problem of dimerization in the half - filled case , since marston and affleck@xcite predicted dimerization for even @xmath7 only .",
    "this is done by calculating the one - site and two - site entropies@xcite whose behavior may be a better indicator of where and how a quantum phase transition occurs than the study of opening of gaps , which is notoriously difficult for a kosterlitz - thouless transition .",
    "the setup of the paper is as follows .",
    "the hamiltonian is presented and the role of umklapp processes at commensurate fillings is discussed in sec .",
    "a few questions concerning the numerical procedure used in the paper are presented in sec .",

    "iv , the accuracy is tested on the su(2 ) hubbard model .",

    "v and vi , respectively .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "the hamiltonian of the su@xmath0 hubbard model is written in the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the number of sites in the chain , @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron at site @xmath18 with spin @xmath19 , the spin index is allowed to take @xmath7 different values , @xmath20 is the particle - number operator , @xmath21 is the hopping integral between nearest neighbor sites , and @xmath4 is the strength of the on - site coulomb repulsion . in what follows @xmath21 will be taken as the unit of energy . the dimensionless @xmath4 and",
    "the dimensionless gaps used in the paper are obtained by dividing their physical values by @xmath21 .",
    "the term @xmath22 could have been kept in the last summation , as it is usually done in the literature , in order to display clearly the su(@xmath7 ) symmetry .",
    "we prefer this form where the coulomb repulsion acts between particles of different spin index only . since it is forbidden to have two particles of the same spin on the same site , the two expressions differ in a shift in the energy only .    at generic fillings ,",
    "this model is equivalent to an @xmath7-component luttinger liquid .",
    "it has one symmetric ( charge ) and @xmath23 antisymmetric ( spin ) gapless bosonic modes . at special fillings , where umklapp processes may become relevant",
    ", we will be interested especially in the half - filled and @xmath3-filled cases , gap may be opened in the spectrum of charge or spin excitations . in this section",
    "we will address the question how the charge and spin degrees of freedom are coupled by umklapp processes .",
    "let us consider @xmath24-filled systems where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are relative prime integers .",
    "due to particle - hole symmetry it suffices to consider the case @xmath27 .",
    "at such a filling the fermi momentum is @xmath28 ( the lattice constant has been taken to be unity ) .",
    "although the bare hamiltonian contains two - particle scatterings only , @xmath29-particle scattering processes may appear as higher - order perturbations.@xcite if @xmath29 particles are scattered from one of the fermi points to the opposite one , the total change in the momentum is @xmath30 such umklapp processes are allowed by momentum conservation if @xmath31 is an integer multiple of @xmath32 , i.e. , @xmath29 has to be a multiple of @xmath26 .",
    "the leading , lowest - order umklapp processes correspond to @xmath33 .",
    "since the interaction is assumed to be local in real space , in the dominant umklapp processes all scattered particles have to have different spin indices , i.e. , we will assume that @xmath34 .",
    "since the most significant contribution to low - lying excitations comes from fermion states close to the fermi points , a linearized spectrum is assumed .",
    "the relevance or irrelevance of umklapp processes and the coupling between different modes can then be conveniently analyzed by transforming the hamiltonian into bosonic form.@xcite using the phase field @xmath35 for particles with spin @xmath19 , which is the sum of the phases of the right- and left - moving fermions , the @xmath29-particle umklapp processes can be represented by an effective term in the hamiltonian which is proportional to @xmath36 , \\ ] ] where @xmath37 indicates that all spin indices are assumed to be different .    in order to investigate the role of these processes let us introduce  in the usual way  the symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of the bosonic fields for which the term charge and spin modes , respectively , will be used : @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "when the band is @xmath40 filled where @xmath25 is relative prime to @xmath7 , the leading umklapp term corresponds to scattering of @xmath7 particles from one of the fermi points to the opposite one . in this case , the effective term in the hamiltonian is proportional to @xmath41 .\\ ] ] as can be seen , this term involves the charge sector only . on the other hand , for a @xmath24-filled band with @xmath42",
    ", several terms may appear in as leading ( @xmath33 ) umklapp processes .",
    "when written in terms of the bosonic fields , both charge and spin modes appear in them .",
    "for example in the su(3 ) model , where in addition to the charge mode there are two spin modes , in the half - filled case , the contribution of the two - particle umklapp processes is proportional to @xmath43    \\\\       & \\!+ \\ ! & \\ ! \\cos\\bigg [ \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}\\left ( 2 \\sqrt{2}\\phi_{\\textrm{c}}(x ) +          \\sqrt{3}\\phi_{\\textrm{1s}}(x ) - \\phi_\\textrm{2s}(x ) \\right ) \\bigg ]   \\nonumber \\\\        & \\ ! + \\ !",

    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these terms are relevant and the corresponding soliton excitations couple the charge and spin modes .",
    "therefore , gap is generated not only in the charge sector but in the spin sector as well , if @xmath42 , in agreement with refs .   and .",
    "the numerical calculations presented in this paper have been performed on finite chains with open or periodic boundary condition ( obc or pbc , respectively ) using the dmrg technique,@xcite and the dynamic block - state selection ( dbss ) approach.@xcite all data shown in the figures were obtained with obc unless stated otherwise .",
    "we have set the threshold value of the quantum information loss @xmath44 to @xmath45 and the minimum number of block states @xmath46 to @xmath47 .",
    "all eigenstates have been targeted independently using four dmrg sweeps until the entropy sum rule has been satisfied .",
    "the accuracy of the davidson diagonalization routine has been set to @xmath48 and the largest dimension of the superblock hamiltonian was around three millions .    in the dbss procedure",
    "the dmrg parameters are set dynamically .",
    "the maximum number of block states ( @xmath49 ) that our program could handle was @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath47 for @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "this determines the maximal chain length that could be treated reliably with the accuracy prescribed in terms of @xmath44 . for small @xmath4 @xmath53",
    ", where the coherence length is large , the block entropy grows very rapidly with increasing block size and the upper cutoff on the number of block states is reached at @xmath54 for the su(3 ) model and at @xmath55 for the su(4 ) model . for these @xmath4 values and for such chain lengths",
    "the truncation error was of the order of @xmath56 for a few dmrg iteration steps and the absolute error of our calculation is in the range of @xmath57 .",
    "calculations on longer systems would give less reliable results and this imposes a serious limitation on the accuracy of the results obtained by finite - size extrapolation .",
    "the most common procedure to locate quantum phase transitions numerically is to calculate energy gaps .",
    "if the su@xmath0 symmetry is not broken in the ground state and the band is @xmath24 filled , in a system with @xmath15 lattice sites , the number of particles with spin index @xmath19 is @xmath58 .",
    "the ground - state energy is denoted by @xmath59 .",
    "the spin and charge gaps corresponding to the increase of energy when changing the spin of a particle or changing the number of particles were calculated according to the formulae @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the lowest energy eigenvalue of the hamiltonian when @xmath62 is increased by one for a given spin , @xmath63 is the lowest energy when @xmath62 is decreased by one for a given spin , and @xmath64 is the lowest energy when the number of particles with spin @xmath19 is increased by one while the number of particles with a different @xmath65 is decreased by one .    since  as will be seen ",
    "it is difficult to study numerically the closing of energy gaps for small @xmath4 values , an alternative approach to study quantum phase transitions has been suggested by several groups.@xcite it uses the anomalies appearing in the generalized @xmath29-site entropy functions .",
    "these functions are easily accessible in dmrg and require to target the ground - state wavefunction only .",
    "moreover , they are expected to have better finite - size scaling properties than the energy gaps .",
    "the von neumann entropy of a single site can be determined from @xmath66 , where the reduced density matrix @xmath67 of site @xmath18 is obtained from the wavefunction of the total system by tracing out all configurations of all other sites . in a similar manner",
    "generalized @xmath29-site entropies can be calculated which are often better indicators of quantum phase transitions than the one - site entropy . in our dmrg approach ,",
    "the one- ( @xmath68 ) and two - site ( @xmath69 ) entropies at the center of the chain , for @xmath70 or @xmath71 and the block entropy of the left half of the system ( corresponding to @xmath72 ) are calculated at the end of each dmrg sweeps .",
    "it turned out that for the su(@xmath7 ) hubbard model the same single - site entropy is obtained when it is calculated on neighboring sites in the center of the chain .",
    "the sites are equivalent .",
    "the two - site entropy @xmath73 is , however , different when it is considered at @xmath70 or @xmath71 .",
    "an indication of the existence of bond dimer order , the breaking of translational symmetry can be obtained  as an alternative to the usual dimer order parameter  from the difference of two - site entropies , @xmath74 as it has been shown in ref .   and will be discussed below , usually the dimer entropy difference converges faster than the energy gap , and it may be more convenient to analyze this quantity . in the next sections , we will use @xmath75 to study the phase diagram as a function of @xmath4 .    as has been pointed out recently by two of the authors,@xcite further information about possible nonuniform phases",
    "can be obtained from the study of the length dependence of the von neumann entropy of a block of @xmath29 sites in a finite chain , @xmath76 , and its fourier spectrum , @xmath77 a finite peak at a nonzero wave vector indicates a corresponding modulation of the state .",
    "e. g. , in a dimerized ( trimerized ) state the @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) fourier component is nonvanishing .",
    "furthermore , in a gapless model the central charge can be derived@xcite from the initial slope of the length dependence of @xmath80 .",
    "this can help to distinguish better gapped and gapless regimes",
    ".      the large-@xmath15 limit of the energy gaps and entropies can be obtained if appropriate scaling functions are used . in a critical , gapless model , in leading order ,",
    "the gap @xmath81 is expected to scale to zero as @xmath82 . in a non - critical model the scaling depends on the boundary condition .",
    "the leading correction is exponential , if pbc is used : @xmath83 while for obc the corrections are algebraic , and @xmath81 is expected to vary as @xmath84 therefore , the following fitting ansatz was used to evaluate the results obtained with obc , @xmath85 with @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 as free parameters .",
    "local quantities , however , are expected to have a better scaling property even for obc . for non - critical models the end effects decay exponentially with a finite correlation length , and the leading correction to the local quantities @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 is expected to have the form @xmath92 where @xmath93 is any of the local quantities listed above .",
    "this form is qualitatively similar to ( [ eq : scale_pbc ] ) , except that @xmath94the distance of the middle of the chain from the boundary  appears in the exponential and the exponent of the algebraic prefactor is _ a priori _ unknown .",
    "since numerical accuracy and proper finite - size scaling are crucial in the present work , we have tested our approach first on the half - filled su(2 ) hubbard model , where exact results are available .    the energy of all eigenstates that have been determined using dmrg with pbc agreed up to 5 digits with the numerical solution of the bethe - ansatz equations .",

    "although for finite systems the fourier spectrum of the block entropy @xmath170 has a peak at @xmath171 , it scales to zero in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the ground state is in fact uniform .    due to the similarity in the behavior of the half - filled su(2 ) , one - third - filled su(3 ) , and quarter - filled su(4 ) models , we suggest that  in disagreement with the result obtained by assaraf _ et al_.@xcite who predicted vanishing charge gap for @xmath172the charge gap opens exponentially slowly at @xmath6 .",
    "the entropy functions of the @xmath173-filled su(5 ) model have been calculated for chains up to @xmath174 lattice sites only .",
    "although no reliable finite - size scaling could be performed , our results indicate similar features as seen in the other @xmath3-filled models .",
    "the one - site entropy possesses a maximum at @xmath109 and it is a smooth function of @xmath4 .",
    "we expect , therefore , that in this case as well the mott transition occurs at @xmath6 .",
    "in summary , we have studied the one - dimensional su@xmath0 ( @xmath1 , and 5 ) hubbard model using the density - matrix renormalization - group method .",
    "excitation gaps , @xmath29-site entropies , and fourier spectrum of the block entropy have been calculated numerically .",
    "the numerical accuracy has been controlled by the quantum information loss @xmath44 which also sets a limit on the largest chain lengths whose properties could be determined with an _ a priori _ defined accuracy .",
    "our method has been tested on the su(2 ) hubbard model in order to see similarities and differences when the @xmath12 cases are studied .",
    "first , the model at half filling has been considered .",
    "the prediction@xcite based on a large-@xmath7 analytical calculation , that the su(@xmath7 ) chain is bond dimerized for even @xmath5 has been numerically verified , and it has been shown that exactly the same behavior is found for odd @xmath7 .",
    "for the half - filled models both the spin and charge excitation gaps are finite for all finite coulomb repulsion @xmath4 , and they open exponentially slowly , indicating a kosterlitz - thouless transition at @xmath6 . since finite - size scaling is notoriously difficult in the neighborhood of a kosterlitz - thouless transition , we have studied the behavior of several entropy functions .",
    "they show no anomalies for @xmath110 which also supports that @xmath6 .",
    "this is , however , not a usual metal - insulator transition .",
    "the dimerization for @xmath12 has been corroborated by the peak at @xmath78 in the fourier spectrum of the length dependence of the block entropy .",
    "next , @xmath3-filled systems have been studied .",
    "it has been shown that the one - third - filled su(3 ) model and the quarter - filled su(4 ) model behave exactly in the same way as the half - filled su(2 ) model .",
    "although the length dependence of the block entropy shows a characteristic oscillation with a period of @xmath3 , the corresponding fourier components vanish in the thermodynamic limit , confirming that the ground state is spatially uniform .",
    "the spin gap vanishes while the charge gap opens exponentially slowly for @xmath110 .",
    "moreover , the best fit gives a value for @xmath13 that is very close to zero .",
    "the location of the transition has been checked by studying the @xmath4 dependence of various entropy functions .",
    "while the one - site entropy has its maximum at @xmath109 , this is not the case for larger blocks . nevertheless , their maximum shifts to @xmath109 in the large @xmath15 limit . within our numerical accuracy",
    "the opening of the charge gap happens with a kosterlitz - thouless type transition at @xmath6 .",
    "the fifth - filled su(5 ) hubbard model shows similar behavior . of course ,",
    "a finite but very small @xmath175 can not be excluded , but even such a small value indicates that the role of higher order umklapp processes needs to be reexamined .",
    "in a recent work,@xcite it has been shown that the entropy profile of the su(2 ) hubbard model for different @xmath4 values as a function of the band filling indicates clearly the mott transition at half filling for any positive @xmath4 .",
