    "in three - dimensional lorentz - minkowski space @xmath0 , the bjrling problem consists of finding a maximal surface ( spacelike surface with zero mean curvature ) containing a given real analytic curve @xmath1 and a prescribed unit normal vector field @xmath2 along @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath2 is a real analytic unit timelike vector field orthogonal to @xmath4 along @xmath5 . in @xcite",
    "the authors solve affirmatively the problem .",
    "for this , we view the interval @xmath5 as @xmath6 and by analyticity , the functions @xmath3 and @xmath2 have holomorphic extensions @xmath7 and @xmath8 in a simply - connected domain @xmath9 that contains @xmath10 .",
    "then the bjrling solution is the surface @xmath11 whose parametrization is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is fixed and @xmath14 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the surface @xmath15 is unique with the prescribed bjrling data @xmath3 and @xmath2 , and @xmath3 being the parameter curve @xmath16 .",
    "we point out that @xmath3 is a spacelike curve because any curve contained in a spacelike surface must be spacelike .",
    "although the bjrling formula only requires a complex integration , there are few examples in the literature of explicit parametrizations of bjrling surfaces : see @xcite .",
    "these surfaces are the lorentzian counterpart of the known examples of minimal surfaces of euclidean space @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to provide new explicit parametrizations of solutions of the bjrling problem .",
    "our surfaces appear when the core curve @xmath3 is a circle or a helix of @xmath0 .",
    "the idea that lies behind these examples is the following .",
    "suppose that @xmath3 is a frenet curve of @xmath0 , that is , a curve where the frenet frame @xmath17 is formed by an orthonormal basis of @xmath0 .",
    "then the unit vector field @xmath18 is a linear combination of @xmath19 and @xmath20 for all @xmath21 .",
    "our examples appear when the curve @xmath3 is a circle or a helix and the linear combination that defines @xmath18 is given by trigonometric polynomials on the variable @xmath22 .",
    "the simple but crucial step is that when the integrand in is formed by trigonometric polynomials , then the integral in can be explicitly obtained .",
    "the above idea was developed in euclidean space by meeks and weber in @xcite .",
    "indeed , when @xmath3 is a circle , the bjrling surfaces are called bending helicoids @xcite and when @xmath3 is a helix , the surfaces are called helicoidal helicoids @xcite .    in lorentzian ambient space , we establish the same program and we follow here the same terminology for maximal surfaces of @xmath0 . however , there are some differences that need to point out . first , there exist circles and helices in @xmath0 that do not parametrize with trigonometric polynomial but as polynomial functions on the variable @xmath22 .",
    "exactly in @xmath0 there are three types of circles depending on the causal character of the rotation axis , namely , the axis is timelike , spacelike or lightlike .",
    "the circles whose axis is lightlike are parameterized by polynomials on the variable .",
    "thus our procedure applies only when the axis of the circle and the helix is timelike or spacelike .",
    "a second difference is related with the vector field @xmath2 . for each @xmath22 ,",
    "the vector @xmath18 lies in the plane spanned by @xmath23 whose induced metric is lorentzian .",
    "since @xmath18 is a unit timelike vector , then @xmath18 belongs to the timelike unit circle determined by @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which is a hyperbola for each plane @xmath24 .",
    "in particular , this implies that @xmath18 does not take any direction in that plane , in contrast to what happens in the euclidean case .",
    "the explicit parametrizations of the new maximal surfaces are given in terms of trigonometric functions but they have cumbersome expressions",
    ". exactly the parametrizations are :    1 .",
    "the core curve @xmath3 is a circle . 1 .",
    "the axis is timelike : equation .",
    "2 .   the axis is spacelike : equations and 2 .",
    "the core curve @xmath3 is a helix .",
    "the axis is timelike : equation .",
    "2 .   the axis is spacelike : equations , , and .",
    "the lorentz - minkowski space is the vector space @xmath25 endowed with the lorentzian metric @xmath26 , where @xmath27 are the canonical coordinates of @xmath25 .",
    "a smooth immersion @xmath28 of a ( connected ) surface @xmath29 is said to be spacelike if the induced metric @xmath30 on @xmath29 via @xmath31 is riemannian . as a consequence of the spacelike condition",
    ", @xmath29 is an orientable surface because a gauss map @xmath32 on @xmath29 is a unit timelike vector field and thus its range lies in one of the two connected components of the hyperbolic plane @xmath33 .",

    "the pair @xmath55 is called the weierstrass data of the surface and we can write @xmath56 the gauss map of @xmath31 is @xmath57 and if @xmath58 is the stereographic projection from @xmath59 into the unit disc @xmath60 from the point @xmath61 , then @xmath62 .",
    "there is a reverse process to obtain maximal surfaces as follows .",
    "consider @xmath29 a riemann surface and let @xmath28 be a non - constant harmonic map with @xmath38 . if @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) satisfy @xmath65 and @xmath66 , then @xmath67 is a maximal surface where @xmath68 is the set of branch points of @xmath31 , that is , points where @xmath31 is not an immersion or points where the induced metric from @xmath0 is degenerate .",
    "we say that @xmath28 is a generalized maximal surface @xcite",
    ".    finally we point out that there exists a duality between maximal surfaces of @xmath0 and minimal surfaces in euclidean space @xmath69 as a metric space in the sense that for each maximal surface of @xmath0 it is possible to construct a minimal surface in @xmath69 and _ vice versa_. indeed , if @xmath70 are the holomorphic @xmath42-forms of a maximal surface @xmath29 of @xmath0 , then @xmath71 are the holomorphic @xmath42-forms of a minimal surface @xmath72 of @xmath69 .",
