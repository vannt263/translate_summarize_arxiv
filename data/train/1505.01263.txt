    "the existence of big bang singularity in the very early universe remains an open issue although most of the mysteries of standard hot big bang cosmological model have been addressed by inflationary epoch @xcite . to overcome this initial singularity ,",
    "ellis @xmath0 @xmath1 proposed a scenario called emergent universe , which is ever existing without singularity and has an almost static behaviour in the infinite past @xcite .",
    "eventually the model evolves into an inflationary phase .",
    "recently there have been lot of interest in emergent universe models based on standard as well as modified gravity @xcite .",
    "this resurgence of interest is because of cmb observations favouring early inflationary universe @xcite and probably this is the possible mechanism for present acceleration @xcite .",
    "historically the credit goes to harrison @xcite for obtaining a model of closed universe with radiation and he showed that asymptotically it approached einstein static universe ( esu ) . then after a long gap ellis and maartens @xcite in recent past",
    "were able to formulate closed universe with a minimally coupled scalar field @xmath2 .",
    "however , exact analytic solutions were not presented in their work and only asymptotic behaviour agreed with emergent universe .",
    "subsequently , mukherjee @xmath0 @xmath1 @xcite obtained solution for starobinsky model with features of an emergent universe .",
    "also mukherjee @xmath0 @xmath1 @xcite formulated a general framework for an emergent universe using an adhoc equation of state which has exotic behavior in some cases .",
    "very recently the idea of quantum tunnelling has been used to model emergent universe @xcite .    in most of the general relativity ( gr ) based models , emergent universe",
    "is generally obtained for spatially closed past esu which is not stable .",
    "contrary to this in modified gravity , emergent scenario can be obtained in spatially flat as well as open / closed model of universe @xcite . also in the context of modified gravity , including braneworld models it has been found , a stable esu can be obtained @xcite .",
    "it may be noted that a stable esu also exists in an open universe in @xmath3 gravity , loop quantum cosmology and horova lifshitz gravity @xcite . since astronomical observations including very recent planck results favour spatially flat universe it is imperative to examine emergent scenario in spatially flat universe . in this paper , we look for a possibility of emergent scenario from particle creation mechanism in spatially flat braneworld models .",
    "the modern era of brane cosmology began in the context of large extra dimensions , made possible by the hypothesis that the standard model of particle physics is localized on a d - brane .",
    "braneworld models of the universe have been the focus of attention in the current decade for the search of many outstanding problems in cosmology .",
    "these kind of models are inspired by string theory . in braneworld scenario , our four dimensional universe ( a brane ) is a hypersurface embedded in higher dimensional bulk spacetime . in this brane - bulk scenario , all matter and gauge interactions ( described by open strings ) are localised on a brane while gravity ( described by closed strings ) may propagate into whole space time .",
    "this means that gravity is fundamentally a higher dimensional interaction and we only see the effective 4d theory on brane . among the different proposals for brane models ,",
    "the two prominent are rs ( proposed by randall and sundrum ) and dgp(proposed by dvali , gabadaze and porrati ) models . in rs models ,",
    "the hierarchy problem could be solved by a warped or curved extra dimension showing that fundamental scale could be brought down from the planck scale to 100 gev .    while @xmath4 model have only _ one _ @xmath5-brane @xcite , the @xmath6 model have two _ two",
    "_ @xmath5-branes at the ends of the orbifold @xmath7 @xcite . due to its simple and rich conceptual base",
    ", rs2 model is very popular and got much attention @xcite and in particular , on the inflationary scenario .",
    "the main idea of the dgp model is the inclusion of a four dimensional ricci - scalar into the action .on the 4-dimensional brane the action of gravity is proportional to @xmath8 whereas in the bulk it is proportional to the corresponding quantity in 5-dimensions .",
    "the model is then characterized by a cross over length scale @xmath9 such that gravity is 4-dimensional theory at scales @xmath10 where matter behaves as pressure less dust but gravity _ leaks out _ into the bulk at scales @xmath11 and matter approaches the behaviour of a cosmological constant @xcite .    in the standard cosmology rs2 model",
    "modifies the early universe where as dgp gravity modifies the late universe .",
    "so in the present universe brane corrections are not effective in rs2 model .",
    "but as phantom energy increases with the expansion , it brings drastic changes in the rs2 model @xcite .",
    "this interesting and recent feature of rs2 model which can modify late time cosmic expansion ( if the energy density of the matter content increases at late time e.g. , phantom scalar field ) has also been beautifully shown by using dynamical system tools in ref @xcite . but this kind of modification does not appear if the energy density of the matter content decreases with cosmic expansion e.g , quintessence scalar field , radiation , dust etc .",
    "thus rs brane model can also modify late time cosmic expansion in addition to its appreciable impact on early universe cosmology .",
    "very recently chakraborty in ref @xcite formulated a emergent universe model in gr using the mechanism of particle creation .",
    "the aim of this paper is to formulate an emergent scenario in braneworld as consequence a of particle mechanism . in a sense",
    "this paper is a generalisation of the one reported in @xcite to include higher dimensional behaviour . often using bg one obtains cosmological surprises .",
    "it may be noted that from thermodynamical aspect it has been proposed that entropy consideration favors the einstein static phase as the initial state of our universe @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section 2 deals with non - equilibrium thermodynamics from the perspective of particle creation in cosmology while in section 3 we present emergent scenario in braneworld models .",
    "the paper ends with a short discussion and concluding remarks 4 .",
    "suppose @xmath12 be the internal energy of a closed thermodynamical system having @xmath13 particles .",
    "the first law of thermodynamics which is essentially the conservation of internal energy is given by @xcite @xmath14 where as usual @xmath15 is thermodynamic pressure , @xmath16 any co - moving volume and @xmath17 represents the heat received by the system in time @xmath18 .    from the above conservation equation",
    ", we get the gibb s equation given by    @xmath19    @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 being the particle number density , heat per particle and energy density of the system respectively .",
    "it may be noted that this equation is also true when the particle number is not conserved i.e. , the system is not a closed system @xcite .",
    "here we shall consider an open thermodynamical system where the number of fluid particles is not conserved and the non conservation of fluid particles is expressed as ( @xmath23 )    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the particle flow vector , @xmath26 is the particle four velocity , @xmath27 is the fluid expansion , @xmath28 stands for the rate of change of the number of particles ( @xmath29 ) in a co - moving volume @xmath30 and by notation @xmath31 .",
    "the positivity of @xmath28 indicates creation of particles while there is annihilation of particles for negative @xmath28 .",
    "any non zero @xmath28 will behave as an effective bulk pressure of thermodynamical fluid and one can use non equilibrium thermodynamics @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we shall consider a flat , homogeneous and isotropic model of the universe , given by the friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) metric in comoving coordinates ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath2 ) as    @xmath35,\\ ] ]    where @xmath36 is the scale factor of the universe . here",
    "we consider universe as an open thermodynamical system which is non equilibrium in nature due to particle creation .",
    "+   + the energy momentum tensor of the cosmic fluid is characterized by the energy momentum tensor @xmath37    the energy conservation relation of @xmath38 takes the following form    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the hubble parameter . here",
    "the pressure term @xmath41 is related to some dissipative phenomena ( say bulk viscosity ) . in the present context , however the cosmic fluid",
    "may be considered as perfect fluid where dissipative term @xmath41 is the effective bulk pressure due to particle creation or equivalently the conventional dissipative fluid is not taken as cosmic substratum , rather a perfect fluid with varying particle number is considered . for an isentropic ( or adiabatic ) particle production",
    "this equivalence can be nicely described as follows @xcite :    using the conservation eqs .",
    "( [ eqthree ] ) and ( [ eqsix ] ) the entropy variation can be obtained from gibb s equation ( 2 ) as    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the temperature of the fluid .",
    "but due to isentropic ( or adiabatic ) process , the equilibrium entropy per particle does not change ( as it does in dissipative process ) , i.e , @xmath44 , and from eq.([eq7 ] ) the effective bulk pressure is determined by particle creation rate as @xmath45    hence , the bulk viscous pressure is entirely determined by particle production rate .",
    "so we may say that a dissipative fluid is equivalent to a perfect fluid having varying particle number .",
    "it may be noted that , although @xmath44 , still there is entropy production due to enlargement of the phase space of the system . in the present context",
    "the same effect is due to the expansion of the universe .",
    "this effective bulk pressure does not correspond to conventional non equilibrium phase , rather a state having equilibrium properties as well .",
    "we note that it is not the equilibrium era with @xmath46    from eq.([eq8 ] ) , we see that if we know the hubble parameter @xmath47 , then the particle creation rate can be determined . further using friedman equations one can relate @xmath28 to the evolution of universe . in what follows as in @xcite , assuming the particle creation rate as a function of the hubble parameter , we can study the cosmological evolution in braneworld .",

    "@xmath1 @xcite in contrast to the emergent scenario in einstein gravity with constant particle creation rate @xcite .",
    "moreover , one can easily check that if we remove the brane effect ( i.e. @xmath118 in rs2 or @xmath119 in dgp model ) then the particle creation rate may be taken to be constant ( by choosing @xmath120 in rs2 model and @xmath121 in dgp brane model ) .",
