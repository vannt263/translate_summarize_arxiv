    "along with many scalar mesons found in experiments , more and more efforts have been made to study the scalar meson spectrum theoretically @xcite . unlike the pseudoscalar , vector , axial , and tensor mesons constant of light quarks , which are reasonable in terms of their @xmath9 classification and quark content , the scalar mesons are too many to accommodate them in one nonet .",
    "in fact , the number of the current experimentally known scalar mesons is more than 2 times that of a nonet .",

    "ii ( sii ) , the nonet mesons near 1.5 gev are treated as @xmath12 ground states , while the nonet mesons below 1 gev are exotic states beyond the quark model , such as four - quark bound states . it should be four scalar mesons in each nonet , but there are five nonet mesons near 1.5 gev .",
    "people generally believe that @xmath14 and two isosinglet scalar mesons compose one nonet , it means that one of the three isosinglet scalars @xmath15 can not be explained as @xmath12 state and might be a scalar glueball .",
    "there are many discussions @xcite which one is most possible a scalar glueball based on a flavor - mixing scheme for these three scalar mesons , which induces there are more ambiguous about their inner structures .",
    "by contrast , the scalar mesons @xmath14 have been confirmed to a conventional @xmath12 meson in many approaches @xcite .",
    "so the calculations for the @xmath16 decays involved in either of these two scalar mesons in the final states should be more trustworthy .",
    "the production of the scalar mesons from b - meson decays provides a different unique insight to the inner structures of these mesons .",
    "it provides various factorization approaches a new usefulness .",

    "certainly , these decays have been studied within the qcd factorization approach @xcite , in which the factorizable annihilation diagrams are calculated through a phenomenological parameter .",
    "so there are large theoretical errors for the qcd factorization predictions .",
    "to make precise predictions of their branching ratios and cp - violating asymmetries , it is necessary to make reliable calculations for the contributions from the factorizable annihilation diagrams .",

    ", one can find the direct cp - violating asymmetries of the decays @xmath131 and @xmath4 have the same sign in the two scenarios , while those of the decays @xmath120 and @xmath119 have contrary signs in the two scenarios .",
    "if the value of @xmath115 [ defined in eq.([ampde ] ) ] is very large , for example , @xmath142 ( scenario i ) and @xmath143 ( scenario ii ) , the corresponding direct cp - violating asymmetry will be very small and only a few percent .",
    "if the value of @xmath115 is small and only a few , for example , @xmath144 ( scenario ii ) and @xmath145 ( scenario ii ) , the corresponding direct cp - violating asymmetry is large .",
    "if the value of @xmath115 is very small and not far away from 1 , then this condition is complex , for the direct cp - violating asymmetry is very sensitive to the relative strong phase angle @xmath114 , for example , @xmath146 ( scenario i ) and @xmath147 ( scenario ii ) , though these two values are close to each other , but their corresponding direct cp - violating asymmetries are very different .",

    "the left ( right ) panel is plotted in scenario i ( ii).,title=\"fig : \" ]    in order to characterize the symmetry breaking effects and the contribution from tree operators and the electro - weak penguin , it is useful to define the parameters below : r_1&= & , + r_2&= & , + r_3&=&. considering the ratios of the branching ratios is a more transparent comparison between the predictions and the data because they are less sensitive to the nonperturbative inputs .",
    "so the large deviation of these ratios from the standard - model predictions could reveal a signal of new physics .",
    "when we ignore the tree diagrams and electro - weak penguins , @xmath148 , and @xmath149 should be equal to @xmath150 , and @xmath151 . from our calculations ,",
    "their values are : r_1=0.33 , r_2=0.85 , r_3=0.86 , , + r_1=0.50 , r_2=0.23 , r_3=1.00 , .",
    "one can find the ratios @xmath152 and @xmath149 for scenario ii are in agreement well with the predictions , while there is a large deviation for the ratio @xmath153 , and the reason is the aforementioned smallest penguin operator contributions for the channel @xmath4 .",
    "for scenario i , there are large deviation for all three ratios and the deviation for @xmath153 is the largest .",
    "these ratios can be tested by the future experiments .",
    "in this paper , by using the decay constants and light - cone distribution amplitudes derived from qcd sum - rule method , we calculate the branching ratios and the direct cp - violating asymmetries of decays @xmath110 in the pqcd factorization approach and find that    * for the decays @xmath3 , their branching ratios in scenario ii are larger than those in scenario i about one order .",
    "so it is easy for the experiments to differentiate between the lowest lying state and the first excited state for the meson @xmath0 .",
    "* for the decay @xmath4 , due to not receiving the enhancement from the @xmath5emission factorizable diagrams , its penguin operator contributions are the smallest in scenario ii , which makes its branching ratio drop into the order of @xmath6 , even so , its branching ratio in scenario ii is still larger than that in scenario i about @xmath7 times . *",
    "the pqcd predictions are much larger than qcd factorization results .",
    "because the latter can not make a reliable calculation from factorizable annihilation diagrams and bring large uncertainties into the branching ratios , so they are still consistent with each other within the large theoretical errors .",
    "* for these considered decays , their tree contributions are strongly ckm suppressed and they are penguin document decay modes . but the decay @xmath131 is abnormal in scenario i , for it receives an enhancement from the large wilson coefficients @xmath132 , which makes its tree contribution survive the suppression . *",
    "the direct cp - violating asymmetry is determined by the ratio of penguin to tree contributions , that is @xmath115 . generally speaking ,",
    "if the value of @xmath115 is large , the corresponding direct cp - violating asymmetry will be small , vice versa . while if the value of @xmath115 is very small and close to 1 , the direct cp - violating asymmetry will be sensitive to the relative strong phase angle @xmath114 .",
