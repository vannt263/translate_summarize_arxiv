    "coupled oscillations are encountered in many contexts in nature and technology .",
    "their prevalence spans over such diverse fields as pacemaker cells in the heart muscle @xcite , neural activity in the brain @xcite , long term climate patterns @xcite or the electrical power grid @xcite .",
    "all such systems have in common that their dynamical behavior results from the interaction between a local oscillation and the coupling between the individual oscillators .",
    "thus , the dynamics depends on generic properties of the oscillations such as their harmonical or relaxational character and the way they interact with each other , which might be local ( diffusive ) , long - range or global @xcite . therefore , the study of a specific system yields also universal information of spatio - temporal organization of other oscillatory systems @xcite . in this context",
    ", we study an electrochemical oscillatory medium , the photoelectrodissolution of n - doped silicon , with a spatial coupling that produces novel types of synchronization patterns . +   + our work ties in with previous studies of oscillatory media in chemical and physical systems .",
    "best known are the belousov - zhabotinsky ( bz ) reaction and the oxidation of co on pt in uhv @xcite , which proved to be prototypical systems with diffusive coupling , exhibiting a variety of dynamically different states , such as sprial waves and chemical turbulence .",
    "in addition to the diffusive , i.e. local , coupling , there are many physical mechanisms leading to a long - range or even global coupling of the oscillators .",
    "this applies , e.g. , to electrically controlled systems , such as semiconductor devices @xcite , gas discharge tubes @xcite or electrochemical systems @xcite .",
    "the most prominent patterns emerging from a global coupling are scale free cluster patterns where the medium separates into a few domains , oscillating with a certain , constant phase lag @xcite .",
    "+   + in parallel to these experimental works , theoretical studies employing the complex ginzburg - landau equation ( cgle ) or phase oscillator models as universal descriptions of oscillatory systems were carried out @xcite .",
    "the former is a normal form equation of an oscillatory medium close to the hopf bifurcation where the limit cycles are only weakly attractive , while the latter captures the dynamics of strongly attractive , coupled limit cycles . among the vast literature on the solutions of these equations , cluster patterns are most relevant in the context of our work @xcite .",
    "typically , one distinguishes between phase clusters , where all oscillators follow the same limit cycle but form distinct groups with a constant phase difference , and amplitude clusters , where the different groups occupy different limit cycles with distinct amplitudes and phases .",
    "both types of clusters emerge in globally coupled systems , however , phase clusters require coupling functions with higher harmonics . thus ,",
    "in contrast to amplitude clusters , they can not be described in the framework of the cgle with a linear global coupling . in our work",
    "we encounter cluster patterns with novel features , most remarkably self - organized chimera states and other types of coexistence of different dynamical states on the electrode surface , and we discuss that a nonlinear coupling leads to their emergence . furthermore , a collection of other peculiar patterns and unusual synchronization phenomena is presented .",
    "+   + our experimental system is the photoelectrochemical oxidation of n - doped silicon to sio@xmath0 under potentiostatic conditions and the concurrent dissolution of this oxide mediated by fluoride species . owing to this interplay of oxidation and etching process",
    "the system exhibits oscillations in current and oxide layer thickness in a broad parameter regime @xcite .",
    "the electrochemical oxidation equation reads : @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the number of charge transfer processes via the valence band of the silicon , i.e. , processes involving minority charge carriers in n - doped silicon .",
    "these holes drive the initial charge transfer step in equation [ eq : oxreac ] , i.e. , the inequality @xmath3 holds and there is no oxidation current without illumination @xcite . a limited illumination and , therefore , limited generation rate of holes in the valence band of the working electrode thus introduces a cut - off for the total current .",
    "it constitutes a global constraint as well as a nonlinear coupling mechanism between the oscillating electrode positions .",
    "+ an additional , global coupling mechanism is introduced by connecting a resistance @xmath4 in series to the working electrode in the potentiostatically controlled experiments .",
    "this external resistance couples the voltage drop @xmath5 across the electrode@xmath6oxide@xmath6electrolyte interface at each individual point of the surface of the working electrode to the total current through the working electrode and the introduced coupling consequently has a linear characteristic .",
    "@xmath7 here , @xmath8 is the externally applied voltage , @xmath9 the spatial average of the current density and @xmath10 the electrode area .",
    "+   + in order to get a comprehensive picture of the dependence of the patterns on the experimental parameters , four of these parameters are varied over a wide range where current oscillations occur .",
    "two of these parameters characterize the electrolyte , the first one being the total concentration of fluoride species @xmath11 and the second one the ph value which determines the distribution of the fluoride on the three species f@xmath12 , hf and hf@xmath13 according to the law of mass action .",
    "both parameters together determine the total silicon oxide etching rate as the different fluoride species follow different etching pathways with distinct rates @xcite .",
    "the other two parameters represent the strengths of the coupling mechanisms given by the illumination intensity @xmath14 for the nonlinear coupling and @xmath15 for the purely linear global coupling , respectively .",
    "+   + after a description of the experimental setup for the spatially resolved recording of the oxide layer with an ellipsometric imaging technique and the data processing in section [ sec : exp ] , an overview of the parameter dependence of the pattern forming regime is given and the patterns occurring in the experiments are classified by spatially averaged quantities .",
    "subsequently , in sections [ subsec : p1]-[subsec : irreg ] for each such class the different prototypic patterns encountered in the experiments are shown in a systematic way .",
    "additionally , the requirements on a generic model exhibiting such spatio - temporal dynamics are discussed .",
    "the working electrodes are the ( 111 ) faces of monocrystalline , n - type doped silicon samples with a resistivity of @xmath16 cm .",
    "they are ohmically back - contacted with a thermally evaporated 200 nm aluminum layer annealed at @xmath17c for @xmath18 minutes .",
    "the silicon is attached to a custom made ptfe holder via silicone paste ( scrintex 901 , ralicks gmbh , rees - haldern , germany ) which also serves as a sealing for the back - contact against the electrolyte .",

    "is constantly stirred with a magnetic stirrer rotating at about 10 hz . the sample illumination is realized by a he - ne laser and the illumination intensity is adjusted by a polarizer plate .",
    "the laser beam is optically expanded to a diameter of ca .",
    "1.5 cm and passes an iris diaphragm so that only its central part is incident on the sample to guarantee a spatially uniform illumination .",
    "+   + for the ellipsometric imaging of the optical path through the oxide , light from a blue led ( @xmath22 nm ) is first elliptically polarized by passing a linear polarizer and a zeroth order @xmath23/4-plate .",
    "it then hits the sample surface at an angle close to the brewster angle of the silicon@xmath6electrolyte system ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the reflected light passes another polarizer which converts changes in the polarization upon reflection caused by the optical path through the oxide into an intensity signal . using a suitable lens , an image of this ellipsometric intensity distribution across the surface",
    "is then created on the ccd chip of a camera ( jai cv - a50 ) .",
    "the data is then digitized using a frame grabber card ( pci-1405 , national instruments ) and preprocessed and recorded by a labview program .",
    "a sketch of the setup ( with the optical components of the ellipsometric imaging path omitted ) is shown in figure [ fig : sketch ] .",
    "+   +        before the experiments the silicon working electrodes are cleaned by first rubbing them carefully with an acetone soaked tissue and subsequently immersing them in acetone ( p.a . ) , ethanol ( p.a . ) , methanol ( p.a . ) and ultrapure water for 5 min each .",
    "the electrolyte is always an aqueous solution of nh@xmath21f ( merck , p.a . ) as a fluoride source and h@xmath0so@xmath21 ( merck , suprapur ) to adjust the ph value .",

    "a constant voltage of 8.65 v vs. standard hydrogen electrode is applied between the reference and the working electrode with a tunable ohmic resistance connected in series to the working electrode . +   + for the analysis of the patterns the spatial distribution of the ellipsometric intensity at specified points in time is considered as well as the ellipsometric signal of one dimensional subsets of the electrode over the entire time window .",
    "furthermore , the time series of the ellipsometric intensity at each individual point is fourier transformed ( fft , matlab ) and the spatial distribution of absolute value and phase of relevant fourier coefficients is then used to gain insight into phase clustering behavior for these fourier modes .",
    "lastly , the data from a selected area on the electrode is hilbert transformed ( matlab ) and the resulting analytical signal , i.e. the complex signal with the original data as the real part and the hilbert transform of the data as the imaginary part , is used to visualize the different dynamics on the electrode .",
    "the occurrence of oscillations and the accompanying pattern formation for a given electrolyte depends on the values of the scaled external resistance @xmath15 and the illumination intensity @xmath14 .",
    "an exemplary 2d parameter space is shown in figure [ fig : parameter ] .     and the illumination intensity @xmath14 for an electrolyte with @xmath11=50 mm and ph 2.3 .",
    "uniform oscillations ( red ) and oscillations accompanied by spatial pattern formation ( blue ) are shown together with stable fixed points with ( circle ) and without ( cross ) an oscillatory transient outside of the oscillatory regime .",

    "conversely , if the external resistance is set at a too high value , the system relaxes monotonically to a stable node . in between , within the oscillatory regime ,",
    "both parameters have an impact on the local oscillators , but as explained above they mediate also a coupling between the individual positions on the electrode . the impact on local dynamics and spatial coupling",
    "can not be separated in the experiments . however , as we elaborate below , we obtain a consistent picture if we assume that the principle trend of the respective locations of patterns and synchronized oscillations in the parameter plane is dominated by the two spatial coupling mechanisms rather than the change in the properties of the local oscillators .",
    "+   + for relatively high illumination intensities , i.e at a low nonlinear coupling strength , the entire electrode oscillates uniformly reflecting a strong synchronizing spatial coupling .",

    "in addition to the uniformity , the shape of the oscillations for highly illuminated n - type doped silicon and p - type doped silicon samples are identical at otherwise matched experimental parameters and in both cases a minimal external resistance has to be introduced .",
    "this similarity in behavior can be fully attributed to the sufficiency of the amount of holes in the valence band to maintain the current present in both cases , strongly corroborating the notion that the nonlinear coupling introduced by the restriction of holes is solely responsible for the emergence of patterns .",
    "consequently , in the parameter space shown in figure [ fig : parameter ] only at illumination intensities below an electrolyte specific threshold value of @xmath31 mw / cm@xmath20 pattern formation can be observed .",
    "if the linear global coupling is too strong , the patterns vanish and uniform oscillations are observed although the current is still restricted by the illumination and an effect of the nonlinear coupling is thus still to be expected .",
    "this behavior is in accordance with literature where the global coupling through an external resistor tends to synchronize the oscillations , at least when the electrode potential acts as the activator @xcite . as a consequence patterns are only found in the parameter region where the nonlinear coupling dominates the linear global coupling , i.e. , in the lower left hand corner of figure [ fig : parameter ] .",
    "most notably , here , sustained oscillations are observed even without an external resistance .      compared to patterns classically found in oscillatory media",
    "the silicon oscillator exhibits two characteristic and peculiar phenomena : first , in a large part of the pattern forming parameter region the global quantities , i.e. , the total current @xmath29 and the spatially averaged ellipsometric intensity @xmath30 oscillate in a simple periodic fashion although local time series exhibit complex oscillation forms up to completely irregular ones . besides , @xmath30 may oscillate with a period-2 or irregularly .",

    "this opens a pathway to a possible deeper understanding of both the origin of the pattern formation and the coupling mechanism .",
    "consequently , in the following the emphasis is first put on the analysis of the first class of patterns and the second and third class are treated as modifications of this first class and are discussed later .",
    "+   +      in a first step we now consider the patterns forming during simple periodic @xmath30 oscillations depicted in the top of figure [ fig : classification ] .",
    "the regularity of the spatially averaged signal implies that the spatial variations of the patterns cancel out on average .",

    "while the two phase domains on the left hand side of the unbalanced electrode in figure [ fig : vergleich ] are of similar size and the amplitude of the fourier coefficient in these domains is similar , there is no counterbalancing phase domain for the domain in the upper right corner .",

    "a striking similarity between this type of pattern and the patterns forming accompanied by a simple periodic oscillation in @xmath30 is that the regions on the electrode retain their respective dynamical behaviors and sizes until the measurement is finished .",

    "conversely , the dynamical behavior in the region in the middle of the cross section changes significantly twice on a long time scale from a completely desynchronized oscillation pattern to a nearly synchronized oscillation pattern with a significantly lower amplitude and back .",

    "we classified these patterns according to the behavior of the spatially averaged signal of the ellipsometric intensity @xmath30 , the dominant case being a simple periodic oscillation of @xmath30 . in this case , the patterns included synchronized oscillations , subharmonic 2-phase clusters emerging from the uniform oscillation by a period doubling bifurcation and desynchronized oscillations .",

    ", the patterns only occur when the total coupling was found to be dominated by the nonlinear coupling imposed by the limited illumination .",
    "however , whether the coupling induced by the limited illumination of the sample is indeed global , remains an open question at this point .",
    "in addition to the case of simple periodic oscillations in @xmath30 , patterns accompanied by period-2 and irregular oscillations in @xmath30 have been presented . in the former case ,",
    "unbalanced 2-phase clusters were always present on the electrode , linking the period-2 oscillation of @xmath30 to the lack of phase balance .",

    "so far , mainly one particular state amongst these coexistence states , the chimera state , has received immense interest . here , we demonstrate that this state is embedded in a series of related coexistence patterns , arguably showing a similar level of seemingly contradictory behavior in the coexisting regions .",

    "the wide variety of such patterns in the presence of a simple periodic global oscillation is remarkable .",
    "this conserved oscillation of the spatially averaged quantities seems to strongly promote the spontaneous emergence of the coexistence of different dynamical states on the electrode . in a wider sense , this can be seen as diversification of the dynamical behavior of a system with uniform parameters .",
    "the essential dynamical features responsible for this behavior remain unclear at this point . considering our experiments ,",
    "the assumption of a nonlinear global coupling as a necessary ingredient seems to be justified when considering the minority charge carrier dynamics in the silicon electrode .",
    "the lifetime of these charge carriers is several orders of magnitude shorter than any characteristic time scale of the observed oscillatory dynamics while the diffusion length is comparable to the system size within one order of magnitude .",
    "this should bring about a long - range if not effectively global coupling .",
