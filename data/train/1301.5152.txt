    "in the last few years , it has become evident that graphene not only displays remarkable electronic properties but can also play a significant role in photonics @xcite .",
    "one aspect that has recently attracted much interest is that doped graphene supports bound electromagnetic modes , known as surface plasmons ( gsps)@xcite , that have the appealing characteristics of being both confined in a length scale much smaller than the free space wavelength@xcite , and potentially controllable using external gates .",
    "very recently , the existence of highly confined gsps has received experimental confirmation .",
    "several aspects of gsp have already been studied theoretically , such as the efficient and directional coupling with nano emitters ( and the associated enhanced spontaneous emission rate ) @xcite , enhanced absorption and resonance diffraction@xcite , metamaterials and antenna applications@xcite and their wave guiding capabilities in ribbons@xcite and edges @xcite .",
    "however , very little is known about how gsps behave when they encounter defects in the graphene sheet they propagate in .",
    "these defects can occur both ( i ) naturally as , for instance , kinks appearing due to fabrication process @xcite , domain borders in graphene growth by cvd@xcite , the presence of multilayer islands@xcite , cracks@xcite and different domains in cvd graphene@xcite or ( ii ) be created externally , for example as the changes of conductivity in gate - induced p - n@xcite or p - n - p junctions @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we present a theoretical study of gsp scattering by one - dimensional conductivity inhomogeneities .",
    "calculations are conducted with an original method based on the rayleigh expansion , which has the advantage of providing analytical expressions in some limiting cases .",
    "+    we consider a free - standing graphene monolayer , placed at @xmath5 , with a spatial inhomogeneity in the two - dimensional conductivity @xmath6 . actually , the presence of a substrate may be indispensable for applications , but it does not change any of the fundamental scattering properties of gsps ( affecting mainly the mobility of the charge carriers ) , which is why in this paper we concentrate on the simplest structure .",
    "we will analyze one - dimensional ( 1d ) inhomogeneities , with translational symmetry in the in - plane direction perpendicular to gsp incidence ( the @xmath7-direction ) , so @xmath8 .",
    "the geometry of the system is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "away from the defect the ( frequency - dependent ) conductivity of graphene is @xmath9 .",
    "defects have a characteristic width @xmath2 , and a conductivity @xmath10 at the defect centre ( @xmath11 ) which can , alternatively , be described by the relative change in conductivity @xmath12 .    in the scattering geometry ,",
    "a monochromatic gsp ( time dependency @xmath13 ) , propagating along the @xmath14 axis ( from the region @xmath15 ) , impinges the defect , which induces some reflection back into the spp channel , as well as some radiation out of the graphene sheet .",
    "notice that , due to the symmetry of the problem , all scattered waves have the same polarization as the gsp ( transverse magnetic ) .",
    "the scattering amplitudes can be computed by using numerical solvers of maxwell equations . here",
    ", we present an alternative method , based on the rayleigh plane - wave expansion ( rpwe)@xcite , which in general must also be solved numerically but presents the advantage of providing analytical expressions for the scattering coefficients in some limiting cases .",
    "we leave all derivations for the supporting info and present here the main equations . within the rpwe method , the electromagnetic field",
    "is written ( all other components can be readily obtained from maxwell equations ) as : @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are @xmath19-components of the wavevectors of a plane wave and gsp respectively , normalized to the wavevector in vacuum @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 are scattering amplitudes , which satisfy the integral equation : @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the scattering potential related to the fourier transform of the inhomogeneity of the dimensionless conductivity @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the speed of light and @xmath27 .    the gsp reflectance and transmittance ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively ) , as well as the fraction of energy flux scattered out of plane @xmath30 can be obtained from the amplitudes @xmath21 ( see supporting info ) .",
    "for instance , @xmath31 .",
    "it must be pointed out that this model does , in principle , account for losses in the graphene sheet . however , for the frequencies and defects that will be analyzed in this paper , for which @xmath2 is much smaller than the gsp absorption length @xmath32 , the inclusion of losses leaves the scattering coefficients virtually unaltered . in a real situation in order to obtain reflexion / transmission coefficients , one has to normalize the gsp amplitudes by the decay factor @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the distance that gsp runs from the launching point to the destination where the amplitude of the scattered gsp is measured .",
    "we have checked ( running simulations with both the rpwe method and a commercial finite - elements code@xcite ) that once this procedure is applied for the lossy case , the scattering coefficients virtually coincide with those obtained when losses are neglected . therefore , and in order to concentrate on the scattering coefficients intrinsically due to the defect , all calculations presented in this paper have been obtained setting @xmath35=0 $ ] . in this way",
    ", current conservation implies @xmath36 . throughout the paper the conductivity is taken from the rpa expression@xcite and , for definiteness , we consider that the chemical potential is @xmath37ev .",
    "as we will show , this choice is not essential , as most results only depend on @xmath38 through the value of the gsp wavevector .    of course , for the scattering coefficients associated to any particular defect will depend on its conductivity profile .",
    "here we do not attempt to computing this profile ; instead , we will assume some basic spatial dependences for the conductivity and compute how they scatter gsps .",
    "we analyze two differentiated main cases : ( i ) smooth variations in the conductivity , described by a gaussian profile @xmath39 , where @xmath2 is the full spatial width at @xmath40 relative conductivity change , and ( ii ) abrupt ones , represented by a step defect @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the heaviside step function .",
    "let us advance that for , all smooth defects considered , our calculations show that the scattering out - of - plane is extremely small ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "this point will be discussed later on ; now it allows us to focus on the reflectance , from where the transmittance can be obtained as @xmath44 .",
    "we first consider a gaussian profile variation in the conductivity with a small @xmath45 .",
    "this profile provides a good approximation to the realistic variations on graphene conductivity arising from atomic steps in the substrate , when graphene is grown on sic@xcite . in this case",
    "the characteristic width of the gaussian profile is @xmath46 , and the conductivity relative change @xmath45 ranges between @xmath47 and @xmath48 .     for a gsp impinging a shallow gaussian conductivity defect , for different defect widths and two values of @xmath45 .",

    "[ fig2 ] renders the reflectance spectra @xmath28 for defects with different widths and two values of the relative change in conductivity .",
    "we observe that @xmath28 has a maximum for each value of @xmath45 and @xmath2 .",
    "this maximum arises as a compromise between two distinct asymptotic dependencies . for small gsp wavelengths , @xmath52 ,",
    "the gsp follows adiabatically the variation of the conductivity and virtually no reflection is generated .",
    "conversely , in the long - wavelength region , the defect width is very small in relative terms ( @xmath53 ) and so is the reflectance , which decreases with @xmath54 due to the decrease in @xmath55 . in between these asymptotic",

    "we observe that , as @xmath45 decreases , the curves converge to the universal reflectance spectra predicted by the foba.,title=\"fig:\",width=377 ] +    in order to gain more insight into the behavior of the gsp reflectance , and obtain some quantitative estimations to support the exact calculation , we compute the plane - wave amplitudes @xmath21 within the first - order born approximation ( foba ) .",
    "this approximation is valid for small variations of @xmath45 and corresponds to neglecting the integral term in the right - hand side of eq.(2 ) , keeping only the linear term in @xmath57 .    within foba",
    "the scattering amplitude reads @xmath58 . using @xmath59 we obtain ( see details in appendix ) @xmath60 notice that , within the foba , the quantity @xmath61 is a universal function of @xmath49 .",
    "it also predicts that the maximum in reflectance occurs when @xmath62 ( independent of @xmath45 ) , with a maximum reflectance @xmath63 .",
    "the validity of the scaling of the reflctance with @xmath49 predicted by the foba is shown in the inset to fig .",

    "the foba captures very accurately the spectral position of the maximum reflectance , even for moderate variations in conductivity , and gives a good approximation to the full reflectance spectra .",
    "the foba also provides insight into the relative strength of reflectance and radiation channels .",
    "the scattering strength depends both on ( i ) the density of final states ( which is much larger for gsps than for radiation channels ) and ( ii ) a matrix element , given by the fourier component of the conductivity variation evaluated at the wavevector difference @xmath64 between the gsp one and that of the final state ( i.e. , @xmath65 for reflectance and @xmath66 for radiation processes ) . in the case of smooth defects , the foba shows that the density - of - states factor dominates over the `` matrix element '' one ( see appendix ) . actually , at the reflectance maximum , the foba predicts @xmath67 , which is in the range @xmath68 for the values of @xmath69 relevant for gsp propagation ( @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the fine structure constant ) .",
    "this preponderance of @xmath28 over @xmath30 holds even for larger defects strengths , where the foba is no longer strictly applicable .",
    "it is also interesting to analyze the scattering by smooth defects with large @xmath45 , as they can be produced by changing the carrier concentration in graphene ( and thus the conductivity ) with an external gate@xcite .",
    "the gaussian shape in this case may simulate a @xmath72 ( or @xmath73 ) junction . in this case , the defect width will depend on the geometrical details of the gate , but can be expected to be of order of @xmath74 @xmath75 , and @xmath45 can be considered a tunable parameter ranging from @xmath76 to @xmath77 .",
    "[ fig4 ] presents the reflectance spectra for different values of @xmath45 , for the fixed defect width @xmath78 .",
    "these results show that , for large relative changes of the conductivity , the maximum reflectance occurs for even smaller defect widths than those predicted by the foba and that , for large @xmath79 , there are spectral regions where the reflectivity is high .",
    "this point is even more apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) , which renders the reflectance spectra for @xmath80 and different defect widths .",
    "interestingly , the reflectance still satisfies approximately the scaling relation in @xmath49 predicted by the foba , see fig .",

    "the open circles render calculations performed within the fem ( in order to validate those performed with the rpwe method ) , for @xmath78 and @xmath80.,width=491 ]    it is remarkable that for the large relative change in conductivity considered in fig . [ fig5 ] , the reflectance in the spectral region @xmath83 is small . actually , there are values of @xmath49 where the reflectance vanishes and , given the scattering out of plane is negligible , the transmittance is almost unity . as the gsp extension in the direction perpendicular to the graphene sheet scales with the conductivity ,",
    "the gsp is very strongly bound at the defect centre .",
    "then , unit transmittance and conservation of energy imply that the electric field is strongly enhanced at the centre , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig6](a ) .",
    "the scaling of the electric field amplitude can be obtained by assuming that , for adiabatic propagation of gsps , the electrical current along the graphene sheet is constant , i.e. @xmath84 , leading to @xmath85 . as for the other em components of the gsp field , we know that they satisfy @xmath86 .",

    "the foba is not a good approximation for these defects where @xmath45 is not small , as it fails to take into account the modification in the gsp field inside the island due to the change in conductivity .",

    "<S> a theoretical study is presented on the scattering of graphene surface plasmons by defects in the graphene sheet they propagate in . </S>",
    "<S> these defects can be either natural ( as domain boundaries , ripples and cracks , among others ) or induced by an external gate . </S>",
    "<S> the scattering is shown to be governed by an integral equation , derived from a plane wave expansion of the fields , which in general must be solved numerically but it provides useful analytical results for small defects . </S>",
    "<S> two main cases are considered : smooth variations of the graphene conductivity ( characterized by a gaussian conductivity profile ) and sharp variations ( represented by islands with different conductivity ) . in general , </S>",
    "<S> reflection largely dominates over radiation out of the graphene sheet . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the case of sharply defined conductivity islands there are some values of island size and frequency where the reflectance vanishes and , correspondingly , the radiation out of plane is the main scattering process . for smooth defects , </S>",
    "<S> the reflectance spectra present a single maximum at the condition @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the gsp wavevector and @xmath2 the spatial width of the defect . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the reflectance spectra of sharp defects present periodic oscillations with period @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the gsp wavelength inside the defect . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the case of cracks ( gaps in the graphene conductivity ) is considered , showing that the reflectance is practically unity for gap widths larger than one tenth of the gsp wavelength . </S>"
