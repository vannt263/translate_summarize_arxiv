    "realistic nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) potentials reproduce the experimental nn scattering data up to energies of @xmath3 mev with a @xmath1 per datum close to one .",
    "however , the use of these potentials in the description of the three- and four - nucleon bound and scattering states gives a @xmath1 per datum much bigger than one ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in order to reproduce correctly the three - nucleon bound state energy , different three - nucleon force ( tnf ) models",
    "have been introduced as the tucson - melbourne ( tm ) , brazil ( br ) and the urbana ix ( urix ) models @xcite .",
    "these models are based on the exchange mechanism of two pions between three nucleons . in the case of the tm model",
    ", it has been revisited within a chiral symmetry approach  @xcite , and it has been demonstrated that the contact term present in it should be dropped .",
    "this new tm potential , known as tm , has been subsequently readjusted  @xcite and the final operatorial structure coincides with that one given in the tnf of brazil .",
    "tnf models based on @xmath4 and @xmath5 meson exchange mechanisms have also been derived  @xcite and their effects have been studied in the triton binding energy  @xcite .",
    "more recently , tnfs have been derived  @xcite using a chiral effective field theory at next - to - next - to - leading order . a local version of these interactions ( hereafter referred as n2lol ) can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . at next - to - next - to - leading order",
    ", the tnf has two unknown constants that have to be determined .",
    "it is a common practice to determine these parameters from the three- and four - nucleon binding energies ( @xmath6(@xmath7h ) and @xmath6(@xmath8he ) , respectively ) .",
    "it should be noticed that in this procedure , the three- and four- nucleon systems are described in the framework of the non relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "relativistic corrections to the few - nucleon binding energies have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite and , recently , the three - nucleon faddeev equations have been solved in a poincar invariant model  @xcite .",
    "these efforts are directed to establish if some of the discrepancies observed between experimental data and theoretical descriptions , as for example the minimum of the @xmath9 differential cross section , can be reduced if relativistic corrections are taken into account .    the @xmath2 doublet scattering length @xmath10 is correlated , to some extent , to the @xmath11 binding energy through the so - called phillips line  @xcite .",
    "however the presence of tnfs could break this correlation .",
    "therefore @xmath10 can be used as an independent observable to evaluate the capability of the interaction models to describe the low energy region . in ref .",
    "@xcite results for different combinations of nn interactions plus tnf models are given .",
    "we report the results for the quantities of interest in table i. from the table , we can observe that the models are not able to describe simultaneously the @xmath0 binding energies and @xmath10 . in ref .",

    "the av18  @xcite was used as the reference nn interaction and the three - nucleon interaction models were added to it .",

    "some polarization observables in @xmath12 scattering at @xmath13 mev have been studied . in the case of the vector analyzing powers ,",
    "it was observed that the predictions of the different parametrizations appear in narrow bands with different positions for each model .",

    "the results obtained using the parametrizations of the tm were of the same quality .",
    "conversely , the proposed parametrizations for the urix model produced a much worse description of @xmath14 and @xmath15 than the original urix model . a possible explanation for this fact is the particular behavior of the profile functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 used in the construction of the model . to this end , in the present paper , we study a different functional form of the profile functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
