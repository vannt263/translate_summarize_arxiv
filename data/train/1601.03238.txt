    "it is well known that quantum mechanics and relativity theory are two fundamentals of modern physics .",
    "since the early 20th century , much effort have been put forward to bridge the gap between them . reconciling quantum mechanics with general relativity gave birth to quantum field theory ( qft ) and several predictions have been made based on the qft . an important prediction in qft is the unruh effect @xcite , which tells us that a uniformly accelerated observer in minkowski spacetime observes the minkowski vacuum of quantum fields as a thermal bath .",
    "the unruh effect reveals that the concept of particle is observer - dependent and the temperature of the thermal bath is proportional to the proper acceleration of the observer .",
    "recently , a number of authors considered the influence of the unruh effect on quantum systems in an accelerated setting @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the quantity of quantum resources , such as entanglement , discord - type quantum correlation and nonlocality , suffer from a degradation from the viewpoint of noninertial observers due to the effect of the unruh thermal bath .    on the other hand , quantum coherence ,",
    "arising from the quantum state superposition principle , is one of the key fundamental aspects of quantum physics  @xcite .",
    "analogous to entanglement and discord - type quantum correlation , coherence is regarded as a physical resource in quantum optics experiments  @xcite , as well as various quantum information processing tasks  @xcite . despite the fundamental importance of quantum coherence , it received increasing attention until baumgratz _ et .",
    "introduced a rigorous framework for the measurement of coherence and proposed several quantifiers , such as the relative entropy of coherence and the _ @xmath0 _ norm  @xcite .",
    "recently , streltsov _ et .",
    "_ found that any degree of coherence with respect to some reference basis can be converted to entanglement via incoherent operations @xcite .",
    "shao _ et .",
    "_ proved that the fidelity does not satisfy the monotonicity requirement as a measure of coherence while the trace norm of coherence @xcite is a promising candidate for coherence monotone .",
    "most recently , it has been found that the coherence of an open system can be frozen under some dynamical conditions  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study quantum coherence between a pair of unruh - dewitt detectors @xcite when one of them is accelerated .",
    "the detectors are modeled by two - level semiclassical atoms with fixed energy gap and are designed to interact locally with the neighbor scalar fields .",
    "we assume that alice s detector is always switched off and remains stationary while bob s detector moves with a constant acceleration and interacts with the massless scalar field .",
    "the quantum resource aspects , such as entanglement @xcite , discord - type quantum correlations @xcite , and quantum nonlocality @xcite of two entangled detectors have been discussed recently .",
    "the advantage of entangled detectors for quantum metrology @xcite under the influence of the unruh effect has also been studied .",
    "the detector is _ classical _ in the sense that it possesses a classical world line and is__quantum _ _ because its internal degree of freedom is treated quantum mechanically @xcite .",
    "we find that the quantum coherence can not be frozen for any acceleration due to the effect of unruh thermal noise .",
    "in addition , quantum coherence is found to be more robust than entanglement under unruh decoherence and therefore the coherence type quantum resources are more accessible than entanglement for relativistic quantum information processing tasks .",
    "we also find that the dynamic of quantum coherence is more sensitive than entanglement with the preparation of the detectors initial state and the atom - field coupling strength , while it is less sensitive than entanglement with the acceleration of the detector .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we discuss the quantum information description of the entangled unruh - dewitt detectors and the evolution of a prepared state in the case of only one detector with relativistic motion . in sec .",
    "iii , we recall the common conditions that any coherence quantifier should satisfy and introduce a few coherence measurements . in sec .",
    "iv , we study the dynamics of quantum coherence under unruh thermal noise and seek the conditions for the frozen of quantum coherence .",
    "the conclusion are given in the last section .",
    "we consider two observers , alice and bob , where each of them possesses a unruh - dewitt detector @xcite modeling through a two - level non - interacting atom @xcite .",
    "the atom carried by alice keeps static and rob s detector moves with uniform acceleration @xmath1 for a time duration @xmath2",
    ". then we let alice s detector always be switched off and the one holed by rob is switched on when it moves with constant acceleration .",
    "the world line of rob s detector is @xmath3 @xmath4 , where @xmath1 is rob s proper acceleration and @xmath5 is the proper time of the detector . throughout this paper ,",
    "we set @xmath6 .",
    "we assume that the initial state of the detector - field system has the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 represents the external scalar field is in minkowski vacuum .",
    "the total hamiltonian of the system is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the detectors hamiltonian and @xmath12 is the energy gap of the detectors .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian @xmath13 between the accelerated detector and the external scalar field is given by @xmath14 , \\label{int}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the minkowski metric . here",
    "@xmath17 is a coupling function which vanishes outside a small volume around the detector .",
    "such a gaussian coupling function describes a point - like detector which only interacts with the neighbor scalar fields @xcite in the minkowski vacuum .    in the weak coupling case",
    ", we can calculate the final state @xmath18 of the atom - field system at time @xmath19 in the first order of perturbation over the coupling constant @xmath20 @xcite . under the dynamic evolution described by the hamiltonian given by eq .",

    "the bogoliubov transformations between the rindler operators and the operators annihilating the minkowski @xmath36 vacuum state can be written as @xcite   @xmath37 where @xmath38 , and @xmath39 . here",
    "@xmath40 is a wedge reflection isometry that makes a reflection from @xmath41 in the rindler region @xmath35 to @xmath42 in the rindler region @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the dynamics of the detectors state after interacting with the field . by tracing out the degrees of freedom of the external field @xmath44 ,",
    "we obtain the density matrix that describes the detector s state @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the detectors s initial state in eq .",
    "( [ is ] ) and the parameters @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are given by @xmath50 respectively , with the parametrized acceleration @xmath51 and the effective coupling @xmath52 @xcite , where @xmath53 is required for the validity of the above definition .",
    "moreover , the effective coupling should be restricted to @xmath54 for the validity of the perturbative approach applied in this paper .",
    "obviously , @xmath55 is a monotonous function of the acceleration @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , we have @xmath56 for a zero acceleration , and in the limit of infinite acceleration @xmath57 .",
    "coherence properties of a quantum state are usually attributed to the off - diagonal elements of its density matrix with respect to a selected reference basis .",
    "with such a fundamental framework , the measure of coherence for a quantum state @xmath58 in a fixed basis can be defined by measuring the distance between @xmath58 and its nearest incoherent state .",
    "the resource based definition and quantification of quantum coherence was introduced by baumgratz _ et .",
    "they suggested that any information - theoretic measure of quantum coherence @xmath59 is required to satisfy the following conditions :    * @xmath60 iff @xmath61 .",
    "* monotonicity under incoherent selective measurements on average : @xmath62 , where @xmath63 and @xmath64 , with @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "* convexity ( on - increasing under mixing of states ) , i.e. , @xmath67 , for any set of states @xmath68 and probability distribution @xmath69 .",
    "there are several coherence quantifiers which have been proven to satisfy the above criteria , for instance , the intuitive _ @xmath0 _",
    "norm , relative entropy coherence @xcite , and trace norm distance coherence @xcite .",
    "the _ @xmath0 _ norm is defined via the off diagonal elements of the density matrix @xmath58  @xcite @xmath70 one can also quantify quantum coherence by the relative entropy of coherence  @xcite given by @xmath71 for any state @xmath58 , where @xmath72 is the von neumann entropy and @xmath73 is the matrix containing only diagonal elements of @xmath58 in the reference basis .",
    "alternatively , the trace norm distance ( t - norm ) has been proposed as a coherence measure , which is @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a set of incoherent states .",
    "our aim is to study the dynamics behaviors of quantum coherence under the unruh thermal noise and find under which condition coherence can be frozen with the increasing of the acceleration parameter @xmath55 . using eqs .",
    "( [ rhof2 ] -[entropy0 ] ) , we can explicitly get the _",
    "@xmath0 _ norm of coherence @xmath76 and the relative entropy of coherence , @xmath77 for the detectors final state density matrix @xmath78 , where @xmath79 are nonzero eigenvalues of the final state @xmath78 .    to obtain the trace norm coherence of the final state @xmath78",
    ", one needs to seek the nearest incoherence state @xmath80 among the set of incoherent states @xmath75 .",
    "fortunately , we noticed that @xmath78 has non - zero elements only along its diagonal and anti - diagonal .",
    "in other words , the state given by eq .",
    "( [ rhof2 ] ) describes a bipartite system with maximally mixed marginals ( @xmath81 )  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the nearest diagonal incoherence state @xmath80 for @xmath78 in trace norm is given by @xmath82 .",
    "the trace norm coherence @xmath83 is found to be @xmath84 which is identical with the _ @xmath0 _ norm of coherence @xmath85 . it have been found in @xcite that the trace norm of coherence for a _ one - qubit state _ has the same form of expression with the @xmath0 norm .",
    "here we have come to the same conclusion for a two - qubit system in the entangled one - detector - accelerated setting .",
    "we are particularly concerned about whether the coherence of the final state can be frozen under some initial or interaction conditions .",
    "such conditions can be obtained by differentiating the coherence of the final state with respect to the acceleration parameter @xmath55 : @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "that is , coherence is unaffected during the interaction between the accelerated detector and external scalar field if the differential is zero . by taking the @xmath55 derivative of the _ @xmath0 _ norm ( or the t - norm coherence )",
    ", we obtain @xmath87 which equals to zero only for @xmath88 or @xmath89 .",
    "the former means that the initial state should be prepared as an incoherence state and the latter indicates that the detectors have no interaction with the external scalar field .",
    "we can see that the decrease of quantum coherence can not be frozen under the influence of thermal noise induced by the unruh effect .",
    "the decoherence of the detectors s quantum state is irreversible due to the interaction between the accelerated detector and its external scalar field .",
    "now let us discuss this phenomenon further in the theory of open quantum systems @xcite .",
    "the evolution from the detectors initial state @xmath90 to the final state @xmath78 in eq .",
    "( [ rhof2 ] ) can also be represented by @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the kraus operators acting on alice s and rob s state . since alice s detector keeps static and is switched off , @xmath92 is in fact an identity matrix .",
    "after some calculations , we find that rob s kraus operators have the forms @xmath94 applying these kraus operators to the nearest incoherence state of the initial state @xmath90 and normalizing the output state , we obtain @xmath95 which is exactly the nearest incoherence state of the final state @xmath78 .",
    "that is to say , the effect of the unruh radiation acts on the detectors state as incoherent operations .",
    "therefore , there is no freezing phenomenon of coherence due to the monotonicity of the coherence measures .    in fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) we plot the _ @xmath0 _ norm ( or the t - norm coherence ) , relative entropy coherence ( rec ) , as well as quantum entanglement of the final state given by eq .",
    "( [ rhof2 ] ) as functions of the acceleration parameter @xmath55 for some fixed coupling parameter @xmath96 and initial state parameter @xmath97 . here",
    "we employ the concurrence @xcite as an entanglement quantifier , which is given by @xmath98 for a state with a @xmath99-type structure . in this definition @xmath100 and @xmath101 , with @xmath102 being matrix elements of the final state density matrix @xmath78 .",
    "the initial state parameter @xmath97 for figs .",
    "( 1a , 1b , 1c ) is fixed as @xmath103 , i.e. , the initial states are singlet states .",
    "it is shown that both the quantum coherence and entanglement are monotone degraded with the growth of the acceleration parameter @xmath55 , which means that the thermal noise induced by unruh radiation destroys all types of quantum resources .",
    "however , the quantum coherence approaches to zero only in the limit of infinite acceleration @xmath57 , while quantum entanglement could reduce to zero for a _",
    "finite _ acceleration .",
    "in other words , quantum coherence is more robust than entanglement as the unruh temperature increases .    in fig .",
    "2 ( i - iii ) , we plot the relative entropy coherence ( i ) , _",
    "@xmath0 _ norm coherence ( ii ) , and entanglement ( iii ) between the detectors as functions of the initial state parameter @xmath97 and the effective coupling parameter @xmath96 for an extremely large acceleration ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , this limit describes a physical picture where alice is freely falling into a black hole while the accelerated rob barely escapes from the black hole with an extremely large acceleration .",
    "we find that both quantum coherence and entanglement monotone decrease with the increases of effective coupling parameter @xmath96 , which means that the interaction between the detector and field destroys quantum resources .",
    "it is also shown that , like the behavior of quantum coherence , quantum entanglement of the final state oscillates with the increase of @xmath97 for any value of @xmath96 .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "( 2 iv ) the coherence and entanglement as a function of the coupling parameter @xmath96 for an extremely large acceleration .",
    "we can see that the entanglement decreases more quickly than coherence and suffers from a sudden death as the effective coupling parameter @xmath96 increases . comparing with the behavior of quantum coherence versus @xmath55 , quantum entanglement suffers a sudden death for an much smaller coupling parameter .",
    "that is to say , quantum coherence is even more robust than entanglement under the influence of the interaction between the accelerated detector and its surrounding field",
    ". then we can safely arrive at the conclusion that quantum coherence is more robust than entanglement under the effect of unruh thermal noise and therefore the coherence type quantum resource is more accessible for relativistic quantum information processing tasks .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied quantum coherence for two entangled unruh - dewitt detectors when one of them is accelerated and interacted with a massless scalar field .",
    "we employ the unruh - dewitt detector model , which interacts locally with the neighbor external field .",
    "this model avoids a physically unfeasible detection of global free models in the full space @xcite .",
    "we find that the quantum coherence can not be frozen during the whole evolution , which is due to the influence of the unruh thermal noise .",
    "it is shown that quantum coherence is more robust than entanglement over thermal noise induced by the unruh effect and therefore the coherence type quantum resources are more accessible for relativistic quantum information processing tasks .",
    "it is found that the _ @xmath0 _ norm coherence equals to rec only for some special cases , which indicates that the measurement of coherence are not consistent in a relativistic setting .",
    "we known that an accelerated observer in the minkowski vacuum corresponds to a static observers outside a black hole in the hartle - hawking vacuum @xcite .",
    "similarly , a static observer in the minkowski space - time corresponds to a free - falling observer in the schwarzschild spacetime .",
