    "<S> we establish the equation determining the localization transition and obtain the phase diagram . using arguments based on supersymmetric field theory and dyson brownian motion we show that the eigenvalue statistics is the same one as of the gaussian orthogonal ensemble in the whole delocalized phase and is poisson in the localized phase . </S>",
    "<S> our numerics confirm these findings , valid in the limit of infinitely large lms , but also reveal that the characteristic scale governing finite size effects diverges much faster than a power law approaching the transition and is already very large far from it . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a very wide crossover region in which the system looks as if it were in a mixed phase . </S>",
    "<S> our results , together with the ones obtained previously , now provide a complete theory of lvy matrices .    since the well - known pioneering applications of gaussian random matrices to nuclear spectra , random matrix theory ( rmt ) has found successful applications in many areas of physics  @xcite and also in other research fields such as wireless communications  @xcite , financial risk  @xcite , and biology  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for such remarkable versatility is that rmt provides _ universal _ </S>",
    "<S> results which are independent of the specific probability distribution of the random entries : only a few features that determine the universality class matter . </S>",
    "<S> the most commonly studied rms belong to the gaussian ensembles  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they have been analyzed in great depth taking advantage of the symmetry under the orthogonal ( or unitary / symplectic ) group of the probability distribution . </S>",
    "<S> as an example of universality , @xmath0 real symmetric rms , although they belong to the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) only if the elements are gaussian variables , display a goe - like level statistics also when the distribution of the elements is not gaussian , provided that it decreases fast enough to infinity  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + there exists , however , a large set of matrices that fall out of the universality classes based on the gaussian paradigm  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> random variables ( i.e. , with infinite variance ) . </S>",
    "<S> the reference case for this different universality class corresponds to entries that are _ lvy _ distributed . </S>",
    "<S> this is the natural generalization of the gaussian case since the limiting distribution of the sum of a large number of heavy - tailed i.i.d . </S>",
    "<S> random variables is indeed a lvy distribution , as is the gaussian distribution for nonheavy tailed random variables . understanding the statistical spectral properties of these , so called , _ lvy matrices _ ( lms ) is an exciting problem from the mathematical and the physical sides  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they represent a new ( and very broad ) universality class , with different and somehow unexpected properties with respect to the gaussian case . actually , a huge variety of distributions in physics and in other disciplines exhibit power - law behavior . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , lms appear in several contexts : in models of spin glasses with dipolar rkky interactions  @xcite , in disordered electronic systems  @xcite , in portfolio optimization  @xcite , and in the study of correlations in big data sets  @xcite , just to cite a few . </S>",
    "<S> + contrary to the gaussian case , the theory of random lms is not yet well established . lms were introduced in the pioneering work of ref .  </S>",

    "<S> this is probably due to the fact that the behavior of lms is richer , and hence more difficult to understand , than the one of goe matrices . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , a mobility edge separating high energy localized states from low energy extended states appears within their spectrum  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite we just discuss the main steps and refer to ref .  </S>",

    "<S> , one can neglect it at first and perform a saddle point . </S>",
    "<S> the solution of the corresponding equation reads @xmath53 where , as it can be shown in full generality @xcite , @xmath54 is the probability distribution of the local self - energy , which coincides with the complex lvy stable law rigorously proven in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that the saddle point equation is invariant under the symmetry @xmath55 where the super matrix @xmath56 verifies the equation @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> thus given a solution @xmath58 , @xmath59 is also a solution . </S>",
    "<S> the localization transition corresponds to the breaking of this symmetry  @xcite : in the localized phase the typical value of the imaginary part of the self - energy is zero , whereas it is finite in the delocalized phase . in consequence , in the former case @xmath58 is a function of @xmath60 only , invariant under the symmetry generated by @xmath56 , whereas in the latter it depends also on @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> since this dependence breaks the symmetry there is a manifold of solutions @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> it is the integration over this manifold that leads to goe statistics for the level correlations . </S>",
    "<S> the derivation is identical to the one presented in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite since the only term in the action that depends on @xmath56 , i.e. ,  that breaks the symmetry , is the @xmath63 one as it happens for erds - rnyi graphs  @xcite and goe rms  @xcite . in the localized phase , </S>",
    "<S> the saddle point solution is instead unique . </S>",
    "<S> therefore no integration over @xmath56 has to be performed and this leads to uncorrelated levels , i.e. ,  poisson statistics  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + let us now turn to the other analytical argument , which is very straightforward but limited to @xmath38 only . </S>",
    "<S> taking inspiration from the recent mathematical breakthrough on rmt  @xcite , we slightly modify the distribution @xmath64 into @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a gaussian distribution with unit variance . </S>",
    "<S> this is equivalent to modifying @xmath1 into @xmath67 where @xmath1 is a lm and @xmath68 a very small goe matrix whose elements have exactly the same scaling with @xmath8 than the ones of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> since this change does not alter the fat tails of the matrix elements , one naturally expects @xmath69 and @xmath1 to be in the same universality class for any @xmath70 and in particular for @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> the statistics of the modified lm  and , by the previous argument , of @xmath1can be obtained using the dyson brownian motion ( dbm ) : @xmath69 can be interpreted , in the basis that diagonalizes @xmath1 , as a diagonal matrix to which an infinite number of infinitesimal goe matrices have been added . </S>",
    "<S> the probability of the eigenvalues of @xmath69 is therefore given by the dbm starting from the eigenvalues of @xmath1 , and evolving over a fictive time of the order @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> recent rigorous results  @xcite guarantee that the dbm has enough `` time '' to reach its stationary distribution , which is the goe distribution , if @xmath73 and the typical level spacing of @xmath1 is @xmath74a very reasonable assumption that agrees well with the numerics . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that for @xmath38 the level statistics of the modified lm , and hence of the original lm too , is indeed goe - like in the bulk of the spectrum  @xcite ( see refs .  </S>",

    "<S> , showing the position of @xmath100.,scaledwidth=42.0% ]    the analysis of all these probes clearly shows that for @xmath38 the eigenvalues and eigenvectors statistics is a goe in the limit of large @xmath8 , in agreement with our previous arguments ( and also with the rigorous results on the delocalized nature of wave functions  @xcite ) . as an example we show in the top panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : r - q ] the behavior of the average value of @xmath101 for @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> it clearly converges in the limit @xmath10 and for any energy @xmath12 to the value @xmath102 characteristic of goe statistics . </S>",
    "<S> all other probes show a similar convergence to the values expected for goe statistics ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for the corresponding plots ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is no longer true for @xmath103 , where the situation is more involved . in the lower panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : r - q ] we show again the behavior of the average of @xmath101 but now for @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> for small and large energies we find the values @xmath104 and @xmath105 corresponding respectively to goe and poisson statistics . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the curves corresponding to different values of @xmath8 seem to cross much before the localization transition , that our previous analytical results located at @xmath78 for @xmath77 . if this were representative of the truly asymptotic large-@xmath8 behavior then it would possibly signal the existence of a mixed phase which could be _ delocalized but nonergodic _ </S>",
    "<S> , i.e. ,  not displaying goe statistics . </S>",
    "<S> however , analyzing carefully the data  thanks to the large number of samples used to average over the disorder  we find that the crossing point is in fact very slowly drifting towards higher energies as @xmath8 is increased . </S>",
    "<S> the same behavior is found for _ all _ the probes we studied . as an example , in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : length ] we plot @xmath106 as a function of the system size for energies belonging to the crossing region . </S>",
    "<S> this indeed shows that @xmath99 is a nonmonotonic function of @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> we can then define a characteristic matrix size , @xmath100 , such that for @xmath107 the statistics appears to be intermediate between poisson and goe ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , whereas for @xmath108 it tends again toward goe . + </S>",
    "<S> the existence of a crossover size can be understood from the properties of the distribution @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> what characterizes the delocalized phase is that , at any site @xmath109 , the imaginary part of @xmath19 receives an infinitesimal contribution from an infinite number of eigenfunctions . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a typical value of @xmath19 ( defined as @xmath110 ) which is finite for @xmath10 and @xmath111 . instead , @xmath112 in the localized phase . approaching the transition from the delocalized side </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath113 becomes extremely small . </S>",
    "<S> thus , one needs to take large enough systems in order to realize that it is different from zero , and hence that the system is in the delocalized and goe - like phase . </S>",
    "<S> the argument , which is based on the interpretation of @xmath114 as the local density of states , is as follows . </S>",
    "<S> the number of states per unit of energy close to @xmath12 is @xmath115 . </S>",
    "<S> this number , multiplied by the typical value of the local density of states , has to be larger than one in order to be in a regime representative of the large-@xmath8 limit . </S>",
    "<S> this defines the crossover scale @xmath116 . </S>",
    "<S> we have compared numerically @xmath117 and @xmath118 and found that they are indeed proportional ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for a plot ) , thus showing that our argument correctly captures the origin of the finite size effects . </S>",
    "<S> we plot the crossover scale [ actually @xmath119 as a function of @xmath12 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : length ] for @xmath77 : it diverges very fast approaching @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> a good fit is provided by an essential singularity . </S>",
    "<S> these results therefore unveil what is the mechanism responsible for the non - goe statistics observed for finite lms in a wide regime before the localization transition .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have presented a thorough analysis of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors statistics of random lvy matrices . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the localization and the level statistics transitions coincide but also unveil the existence of a crossover scale which is very large even far from the transition . </S>",
    "<S> thus , many practical cases are expected to be in the @xmath120 regime . in consequence , the mixed behavior proposed in ref </S>",
    "<S> .  @xcite will be often present in practice even though it is absent in the large-@xmath8 limit . </S>",
    "<S> our work , together with the results obtained previously , now provides a complete theory of lms . </S>",
    "<S> + there are several directions worth pursuing more </S>",
    "<S> . it would be interesting to determine analytically the form of the divergence of @xmath100 . on the basis of our numerics and in analogy with previous works  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we expect @xmath121 . </S>",
    "<S> most probably , the emergence of the crossover scale producing an apparent mixed phase takes place in several other related situations ( e.g. , ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) that are , therefore , to be reanalyzed . </S>",
    "<S> finally , our results provide a guideline for mathematicians working on rmt . </S>",
    "<S> thanks to the recent advances in the mathematical analysis of random matrices  @xcite and localization phenomena  @xcite our findings are likely to be rigorously proven in a not too distant future .    </S>",
