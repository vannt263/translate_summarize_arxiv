    "in spinless@xcite few - electron systems the ground - state angular momentum is not influenced by the coulomb interaction and for electrons with spin the angular momentum of the ground state differs from the noninteracting case by at most @xmath0.@xcite on the other hand , in quantum dots the coulomb interaction influences strongly the values of the magnetic field at which the angular momentum transitions appear .",

    "we show that the angular momentum transitions , appearing for the ring - confined electrons as a consequence of the aharonov - bohm effect , lead to a simple piecewise linear dependence of the exchange energy on the external magnetic field .",
    "since the unitary evolution in quantum computation needs precise control of the underlying qubit interaction this simple dependence makes our system a good candidate for the realization of the magnetic field controllable pair of spin qubits .",

    "the magnetic fields for which the ring subsystem is in the triplet state have been marked by vertical arrows on the angular momentum staircase .",
    "the states with spin singlet of the ring subsystem correspond to @xmath77 .",
    "since the angular momenta of both ring - confined electrons exceed 6 the tunnel coupling between the dot and ring wave functions is negligible [ cf . fig .",
    "8 ] and the spin of the dot confined electron does not influence the energy . therefore ,",
    "the states with triplet configuration of spins in the ring subsystem correspond to @xmath77 and @xmath74 degeneracy .",
    "the envelope of the lowest @xmath91 energy levels with three electrons and two electrons in the ring run almost parallel to each other as function of the external field .",
    "one should expect@xcite that for equal depth of the ring and the dot at very large magnetic field the three - electron ground state corresponds to electrons forming an equilateral triangle in the ring , but in the studied magnetic field range we did not observe a distinct transition of the last electron from the dot to the ring .",
    "we have considered a quantum dot inside a quantum ring  a unique example of lateral coupling realized with conservation of circular symmetry of the confinement potential .",
    "a simple model for the potential was used .",
    "the model assumes parabolic confinement in both the dot and the ring so approximate formulas can be given for the lowest - energy single - electron dot- and ring- confined states .",
    "one- , two- and three - electron systems were studied using the exact diagonalization approach .",
    "we have investigated the distribution of electrons between the dot and the ring .",
    "this distribution depends not only on the parameters of the confinement potential but it can also be altered by an external magnetic field , which therefore can be used as a driving force to transfer the electrons from the dot to the ring or _",
    "vice versa_. the passage of an electron from the dot to the ring should be detectable by a change of the aharonov - bohm magnetic period .",
    "the present model allows also for simulation of the magnetic field induced electron trapping in local potential cavities .",
    "we have studied the exchange energy in the two electron system with one electron confined in the dot and the other in the ring . due to the angular momentum transitions resulting from the aharonov - bohm effect for the ring - confined electron",
    ", the singlet - triplet splitting exhibits a piecewise linear dependence on the external magnetic field .",
    "this should be a more elegant method for the control of the spin - spin coupling than the smooth oscillatory dependence predicted for side - by - side coupled dots.@xcite    * acknowledgments * this paper has been partly supported by the polish ministry of scientific research and information technology in the framework of the solicited grant pbz - min-008/p03/2003 , the flemish science foundation ( fwo - vl ) , the concerted action programme ( iuap ) and the university of antwerpen ( vis and goa ) .",
