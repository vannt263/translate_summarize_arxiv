    "in recent years the dynamics of finite condensed matter systems , especially atomic and molecular clusters , has been extensively studied from a nonlinear dynamics perspective @xcite .",
    "various quantities of interest like lyapunov exponents , lyapunov spectra , distributions of finite - time lyapunov exponents and the kolmogorov entropy have been computed to see evolution of chaoticity and ergodicity .",
    "very general considerations lead to the expectation that the lyapunov exponents and the kolmogorov entropy should increase with energy . however , there are indications that different systems can display a variety of behaviour , and details of how such indices change and the different kinds of possible ( qualitative as well as quantitative ) behaviour  the various universality classes , so to speak  have not yet been completely characterized .    in the present work",
    "we calculate the largest lyapunov exponent , for small rare - gas and metal clusters ( modelled , respectively , by the lennard - jones ( lj ) and the many  body gupta ( gu ) @xcite potentials ) as well as for bulk rare - gas solid , namely 256 lj atoms in a box with periodic boundary conditions . in the range",
    "studied , is generally linearly related to energy ( except at very low energies ) but shows a sharp change in slope at an energy which can be related to the melting transition .",
    "we also compute an estimate for through a semi - empirical methodology provided by a recently proposed geometrical theory of hamiltonian chaos @xcite . under certain approximations",
    "this allows for the estimation of the relative contribution of stable modes of a hamiltonian system towards chaotic behaviour .",
    "the approximations inherent in the theory @xcite are fulfilled in bulk systems ( where @xmath0 is large ) , but do not appear entirely satisfactory in small clusters .",
    "this geometrical theory has as its input the curvature of the configuration space manifold and its fluctuation .",
    "these quantities and their variation with temperature are themselves interesting because they yield a statistical quantification of the potential energy surface .",
    "recent approaches to the computation of lyapunov exponents from ( local ) instantaneous mode analysis @xcite use this information implicitly .",
    "the simplest understanding of chaotic dynamics in such ( hamiltonian ) systems is the standard kam picture @xcite .",
    "when the number of freedoms becomes large ( for 13 atoms , the phase space is 78 dimensional ) the picture of a phase space foliated by tori , with surrounding stochastic regions @xcite is not particularly relevant .",
    "however , the motion for specific initial conditions remains nearly periodic , while for others there can be a positive lyapunov exponent .",
    "in particular the kam theorem underestimates the chaotic thresholds by several orders of magnitudes @xcite in high - dimensional systems as the critical perturbation scales as @xmath1 which rapidly goes to zero with increasing @xmath2 ( degrees of freedom ) , contrary to the experience in numerical simulations beginning with fpu s famous result @xcite . and",

    "an alternate means of analysis is through decorrelation of the eigenvectors of the instantaneous jacobian along a trajectory @xcite .",
    "the timescale for this process is greatly reduced by the presence of the regions of negative curvature ( unstable modes ) which also increase at the melting phase  transition point .",
    "such ideas have been at the root of a variety of studies of the lyapunov exponent or related quantities .",
    "posch and hoover @xcite calculated lyapunov spectra of solid and liquid lj systems in two and three dimensions , and attempted to fit a power law to this data , obtaining different exponents in the solid and liquid phases , although no definite significance could be ascribed to these .",
    "berry and coworkers @xcite have examined a variety of quantities including finite - time or local approximations to kolmogorov entropy and lyapunov spectrum in lennard - jones ( lj ) and morse clusters containing between 3 and 13 particles @xcite .",
    "these studies have been able to make contact between the features of the potential energy surface and the variation of different dynamical indicators .",
    "recently sastry @xcite has computed the maximal lyapunov exponent as well as the entire lyapunov spectra for a 32 atom lennard - jones fluid in the temperature range 50800 k. a power law fit of with temperature does not yield a single exponent but a crossover ( around @xmath3 ) between the exponent = 1 at low temperature to 1/2 at high temperatures @xcite . in a finite lattice system , butera and caravati",
    "@xcite simulated the coupled rotor system in two dimensions which has a kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) transition at constant energy and observed that the scaling of with the temperature changes at precisely the kt temperature .",
    "recent simulations on the xy model in 2 and 3 dimensions by caiani _ et .",
    "_ @xcite have shown the differences between kt transition and true symmetry  breaking transition in three dimensions .",
    "the crossover in scaling of with temperature or energy per particle , also observed in other lattice models where it had purely dynamical significance @xcite , was suggested to coincide with the crossover from slow to fast diffusion in the phase space @xcite and was labelled as the strong stochasticity threshold ( sst ) .",
    "the generality of sst in nonlinear hamiltonian systems is not obvious , although it appears to persist even for large degrees of freedom in the models studied .",
    "it was also found that sst occurs in lattice models with lennard  jones interactions in two and three dimensions @xcite , the signature being a rapid relaxation of the specific heat and independence of on the initial conditions .",
    "similar transitions have also been observed in small rare - gas and metal clusters @xcite .",
    "a somewhat different interpretation of these results has also been proposed @xcite",
    ".    in small rare - gas atomic clusters , has been calculated at the melting transition @xcite , which is a finite - size analogue of the bulk melting transition @xcite . whereas changes discontinuously with energy for lj@xmath4 and lj@xmath5 , for lj@xmath6 , the slope changes discontinuously . at the energy of this change ,",
    "indicators of melting like lindemann index or density of states show characteristic signature , so it was proposed that is a good indicator of melting transition @xcite .",
    "subsequent work @xcite has revealed that the behaviour of as a function of the energy is more complicated and can be different depending on the nature of the low energy configuration that the system starts from .",
    "more recently dellago and posch @xcite have calculated the lyapunov spectra and related quantities like the fraction of unstable modes for the melting transition of modified lj systems in 2d ( the so - called wca and ljs potentials ) .",
    "they find that has a broad peak near the melting density and a steplike increase at the melting temperature , and further suggest that there is a change in the shape of the lyapunov spectra at the transition density .",
    "critical phenomena which occur at higher temperatures in larger fragmenting clusters have also been studied @xcite , although the claimed form for the ( finite - time ) lyapunov exponent , namely @xmath7 , with universal behaviour for @xmath8 is questionable @xcite .",
    "our work in the present paper is focussed on the study of clusters and bulk at the melting transition , with particular emphasis on the lyapunov exponent and the curvature fluctuations . in the next section ,",
    "we examine the behaviour of and in section 3 , the nature of the curvature fluctuations are analysed in order to make contact between theory and simulations .",
    "the methodology and theoretical background for the extraction of from curvature data is elaborated in section 3 , where our results for bulk as well as cluster systems are also presented .",
    "this is followed by a summary and discussion in section  4 .",
    "as is by now well  known @xcite , atomic clusters with as few as six or seven particles undergo a finite size analogue of the bulk melting phase transition , which is marked by a jump in the lindemann index and the onset of rapid isomerization .",
    "the liquidlike phase of the small clusters is however unlike the bulk liquid in one important respect : due to the phase space constraints , the atomic displacements ( `` hopping processes '' ) are highly correlated , giving rise to @xmath9 spectra of single particle potential energy fluctuations @xcite . it has been observed that in metal clusters particles can occupy two types of sites  of low and high energy respectively , and the onset of the liquid phase corresponds to the onset of an isomerization occuring through four particle interchange between high and low energy sites @xcite .",
    "similar features are expected for rare ",
    "gas clusters also .",
    "this peculiar dynamics has interesting consequences which we examine in this section .",
    "we consider clusters of up to 13 atoms interacting via lennard - jones ( lj ) potential @xmath10 which is appropriate for rare ",
    "gas atoms ; we work in reduced units when @xmath11 . in order to model metallic clusters",
    "the manybody gupta ( gu ) potential @xcite , @xmath12^{1/2}\\}.\\end{aligned}\\]]is commonly used . here",
    "@xmath13 is the distance between the atoms @xmath14 and @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the interatomic distance in the bulk ( fcc ) crystal .",
    "the specific metallic cluster system we model corresponds notionally to ni , for which we use parameters given in ref.@xcite : @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is the bulk cohesive energy of the metal by which all energies are scaled )",
    ". quantities like and kolmogorov - sinai entropy have been calculated for small rare ",
    "gas clusters and the relation of the potential energy surface to local dynamical behaviour has been analysed @xcite .",
    "in particular it is known that smooth saddles cause a drop in local chaoticity indicators @xcite .",
    "time is measured in units of @xmath19 for lj clusters and @xmath20 for gupta clusters .",
    "constant energy simulations are done using the verlet algorithm with stepsize @xmath21 in these units , and the total energy is conserved to @xmath22 .",
    "the total integration time varies between @xmath23 to @xmath24 depending on the potential and the system size .",
    "simulations start at the global minimum of the structure and then gradually move up in energy ; at the highest temperatures studied evaporation does not set in within the time period of the computation .",
    "temperature is defined in the usual manner , as proportional to the average kinetic energy per particle , @xmath25 , @xmath26 being the boltzmann constant .    at very low energies the dynamics",
    "is nonergodic , in particular for 13 particle clusters the nonergodicity can be persistent upto rather high energies .",
    "the breathing mode in lj@xmath4 was recently studied by salian _",
    "this mode is stable ( _ i .",
    "e.  _ nondecaying ) up to an energy @xmath27 per particle above the global minimum ; the corresponding mode for lj@xmath28 survives only up to energy 0.042 above the minimum .",
    "stability here is tested by starting trajectories with isotropic stretching of the global minimum structure . in this nonergodic region",
    "the system initialised with small random distortion of the icosahedral structure has a very small positive lyapunov exponent while for larger distortions at the same energy , can be much larger . as energy increases , the overall cluster distortions increase and",
    "this mode becomes markedly unstable . for large initial distortions from icosahedral geometry of lj@xmath4 ,",
    "a chaotic transition occurs at a lower energy and is manifested as the divergence of the microcanonical specific heat .",
    "this energy depends on the equilibration time but tends to a nonzero value for large equilibration times .",
    "such transitions are not size  specific , and have been seen for non  magic clusters as well .",
    "1 shows the variation of @xmath29 with the reduced energy per particle , @xmath30 , for lj and gu clusters of various sizes . at higher energies",
    "@xmath29 is linear but at a certain energy a sharp change in the slope is evident in all cases . precisely at this energy",
    "the conventional criterion of melting applies , namely the lindemann index crosses the value 0.1 ( lindemann indices for gu clusters have been studied in @xcite ) . in lj@xmath4 which has a large solid ",
    "liquid coexistence region between @xmath31 , changes slope at @xmath32 . in lj@xmath33 where the lindemann index increases continuously , the discontinuity in appears just after the lindemann index has reached its critical value 0.1 .",
    "the slope in the liquid phase is always smaller , indicating that the diffusive modes have different chaotic properties , giving rise to different energy dependence of the change in the slope of @xmath29 can also be taken to be a characteristic signature of melting in small clusters .",
    "the slope of the @xmath29 curves are generally smaller for the larger cluster ; furthermore , the sharpness of the discontinuity ( in slope ) is reduced as the cluster size increases .    for the gupta clusters , however , these trends with @xmath0 are not strongly  marked which is a consequence of the manybody character of the gu potential : even if a pair of particles is not interacting directly ( being outside the potential cutoff ) the corresponding elements of the hessian matrix need not vanish because of the manybody term .",
    "we find that the slope changes distinctly at an energy corresponding to top of the jump in the lindemann curve .    the third system we study is bulk , and fig .",
    "2(a ) shows @xmath29 for the system of 256 lj particles in a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions at the reduced density @xmath34 and reduced melting temperature 1.15 .",
    "initial conditions for these simulations were as follows : the atoms were initially at fcc lattice positions , with initial velocities taken randomly from an appropriate gaussian distribution . for @xmath35",
    "the crystal is unstable and soon melts .",
    "it is possible for melting to occur for slightly lower energies if integration is carried for longer times but the time required to melt is not a monotonically decreasing function of energy . here",
    "@xmath29 shows a jump which obviously can be ascribed to the increase in the disorder at melting .",
    "the data shown is the lyapunov exponent of solid phase or the liquid phase trajectory only which are obtained by discarding the premelting portion of a trajectory that melts .",
    "similar results for bulk melting have also been reported by dellago _ et .",
    "_ @xcite and nayak _ et .",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "while both the bulk and the cluster are disordered by melting ( change in entropy at melting , @xmath36 for lj@xmath5 and 1.7 for lj crystal @xcite and specific heat of even 6 particle cluster shows a peak ) in the cluster liquid phase is significantly smaller than the value obtained by extrapolating from the solid phase , in contrast with obtained in bulk liquid .",
    "this suggests that in the cluster liquid phase there are stabilizing influences on the dynamics which are absent in the bulk liquid .",
    "we conjecture that the correlated hopping processes in clusters @xcite provide the necessary mechanism .",
    "this is consistent with the observation made above that the @xmath29 curve gets smoother with the cluster size .",
    "the observed lyapunov phenomenon for the clusters is not just an effect of the smeared  out bulk transition _",
    "i. e.  _ a manifestation of finite dynamical coexistence region in the clusters which vanishes in the bulk limit .",
    "the properties of the coexistence region ( in particular its width ) depend sensitively on the cluster geometry _",
    "e. g.  _ the fact that the cluster is magic or not .",
    "but the trends in the lyapunov exponent depend on the size in a simple manner and are independent of the magic ",
    "nonmagic relation .",
    "the spectra of @xmath37 positive lyapunov exponents for the clusters vary smoothly with energy . for lj clusters they are linear in the entire range with a slope that increases with energy while in gu clusters they acquire increasing curvature .",
    "this is contrast to the results of dellago and posch @xcite for bulk melting in two dimensions where the curvature of the spectra changes sign smoothly at certain densities ( at constant temperature ) .",
    "it remains a task to extract more useful information from the shape of the lyapunov spectra .",
    "however the smoothness of the spectra at cluster melting implies that the relation ( if any ) between thermodynamic and dynamic entropies is nontrivial .",
    "in this section we apply the geometric theory of hamiltonian chaos developed by pettini and coworkers @xcite in order to interpret and rationalize the results of our numerical simulations in terms of an underlying ( microscopic ) mechanism .",
    "this theory , the salient features of which are summarized below , is attractive because it attempts to unite features of the potential energy surface with the dynamical properties of the system as encoded in the lyapunov exponents .",
    "one additional motivation in applying this theory to finite cluster systems is to determine the limits of applicability of the general framework , which has mainly been applied to lattice models where the calculated lyapunov exponents are found to be in good agreement with empirical exponents @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the classical dynamics on manifolds of constant negative curvature is chaotic @xcite .",
    "the dynamics on a manifold with fluctuating positive curvature can also be chaotic @xcite : this fluctuation , via the mechanism of parametric instability , is responsible for creating chaos in systems such as the fermi  pasta ",
    "ulam @xmath38 and @xmath39 chains @xcite and for a driven one  dimensional oscillator studied by chaudhuri _ et .",
    "these studies have provided much of the motivation for the development of the geometric theory of chaos @xcite .",
    "barnett _ et . al .",
    "_ @xcite have applied similar ideas to calculation of lyapunov exponent of a dilute gas .",
    "the geometric theory makes a diagonal approximation in the sense that it uses information only about the trace of the instantaneous hessian matrix _",
    "i. e.  _ @xmath40 .",
    "when the equations of motion are put in a differential - geometric form , this term appears as the ricci curvature ( curvature locally averaged over the directions ) of the enlarged configuration manifold in the eisenhart metric @xcite , ds^2=-2v(q)dt^2+a_ijdq^idq^j+dtdq^n_f+1 . here",
    "@xmath41 is the potential energy and the kinetic energy is @xmath42 .",
    "the relevance of potential curvature has been noted before @xcite .",
    "the ricci curvature does not have this simple form in other metrics but the essence of the assumption is that all the directions in the phase space are equally curved after a coarse - graining along a trajectory .",
    "the dynamical trajectories are the geodesics of this manifold . in above models this appears to be the dominant mechanism for chaos as there are no unstable modes ( corresponding to the negative eigenvalues of the instantaneous hessian matrix or regions of negative curvature ) which are _ local _ mechanism of chaos .    if it is assumed that the curvature fluctuations have gaussian spectra upto a high - frequency cutoff _",
    "i. e.  _ the dynamics generates a gaussian random process for curvatures , then one can dispense with the necessity of following a trajectory and an estimate of the largest lyapunov exponent , @xmath43 can be obtained via monte carlo sampling .",
    "this is the essence of the gaussian approximation @xcite , within which excellent agreement is obtained between and @xmath43 .",
    "the presence of additional unstable modes renormalizes the calculated exponent , although this is nontrivial to calculate",
    ". therefore the unrenormalized exponent gives an estimate of the chaoticity caused by stable modes only ( the unstable modes also contribute to parametric instability by their presence in @xmath40 but it is not their major effect on chaoticity ) .",
    "the theoretical basis of the diagonal approximation assumption is that the local fluctuation of the ricci curvature detects deviation from isotropy ( at a point ) because isotropic manifolds are necessarily of constant curvature by schur s theorem @xcite .",
    "the crossover between the regimes of weak and strong chaos in high - dimensional systems can be detected by examining the behaviour of the mean curvature , @xmath44 , as a function of the energy density . in the integrable limit",
    "@xmath44 is independent of energy @xcite .",
    "corresponding to a hamiltonian @xmath45 of @xmath0 particles with an interaction @xmath46 , @xmath47 there are @xmath48 equations of motion , @xmath49 the associated jacobi equation for the second deviations is then @xmath50 where @xmath51 are the components of the vector of second deviations .",
    "after some approximations @xcite this can be converted to an equation for @xmath52 , @xmath53 which is , in effect , an equation for a linear oscillator with time  dependent frequency @xmath54 .",
    "the solutions of this equation are unbounded for typical @xmath55 and the lyapunov exponent is just given by the rate of exponential growth of the envelope of @xmath56 @xcite",
    ". pettini _ et .",
    "@xcite show that @xmath55 is just the sectional curvature ( which is the generalization of gaussian curvature to many dimensions ) relative to the plane containing @xmath57 and @xmath58 in the eisenhart metric .",
    "the diagonal approximation consists in replacing @xmath59 by the simpler quantity @xmath60 with @xmath61 the number of degrees of freedom , which is @xcite , the ricci curvature per degree of freedom _",
    "i. e.  _ sectional curvature has been averaged over relative orientations of @xmath57 and the velocity vector . under the further assumption that the curvature is gaussian distributed with a mean @xmath62 and variance @xmath63 and are @xmath64-correlated , pettini _ et .",
    "@xcite derive an expression for an estimate of the lyapunov exponent @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a characteristic time implied by the smoothness of the underlying manifold _",
    "i. e.  _ the time - interval below which dynamics of curvatures can not be regarded as a random process .",
    "the main result of the geometric theory is an estimate of the lyapunov exponent , @xmath43 given in eq .",
    "( [ parametric ] ) , for which it is necessary to obtain the mean curvature , @xmath44 and the variance , @xmath67 .",
    "these quantities can be calculated along a typical trajectory using eq .",
    "( [ simpler ] ) , and the assumption of @xmath68correlated curvature fluctuations can be directly verified .    the determination of the timescale @xmath66 ( see eq .",
    "10 ) is more tricky .",
    "one estimate which has been used @xcite is @xmath69 this expression for @xmath66 here is actually that for @xmath70 in ref.@xcite ( see the discussion following eq .  45 there ) .",
    "however in the presence of negative curvatures it may be more accurate to use a different timescale @xcite @xmath71 we find ( see the next subsection ) that @xmath72 is more accurate than @xmath66 insofar as it provides a better numerical match with the autocorrelation decay timescale for the systems studied here .",
    "one additional minor point is that the effective number of freedoms is @xmath73 rather than @xmath48 , since the six conserved quantities ( linear and angular momenta ) give rise to zero frequency modes and thus do not contribute to the chaoticity .",
    "this does not change qualitative conclusions ( indeed it must not ) and improves results in most cases .",
    "the application of the geometric theory to the systems considered in sec.[melt ] is of interest for two reasons .",
    "firstly , this formalism has so far been mostly applied to lattice models , where parametric instability is the main source of chaos .",
    "it would be useful to determine the extent to which the formalism works for off  lattice models with significant local instability .",
    "secondly , the partition of the chaoticity of the system into local and nonlocal components may help in clarifying the behaviour of lyapunov exponent at melting .",
    "in particular , it would be interesting to know whether the overall instability of the system can be separated into these two components , and if so , whether they behave differently at phase transitions .",
    "the melting transition in finite systems appears to have a distinct signature  the lyapunov exponent shows a knee , where the slope changes discontinuously @xcite . for bulk",
    ", the fraction of the unstable modes has a discontinuous jump at melting .",
    "therefore a rapid increase in local instability and consequently , a jump in the lyapunov exponent can be expected .",
    "such a change may not be apparent in the contribution of the parametric instability , and therefore in the situation of cluster melting where lyapunov exponent does not increase , it is an open question whether the local instability increases or not .      as should be clear from the preceeding discussion , application of the geometric theory in order to make",
    "comparison with the results of our numerical simulations involves a number of sensitive estimates and several approximations .    following the general procedure outlined in sec .",
    "iiib above , we have calculated the estimate @xmath43 ( cf .",
    "eq .  [ parametric ] ) for bulk ( lj ) and various lj and gu clusters in an energy range which encompasses melting , from long trajectories of duration up to @xmath74 .",
    "the data for @xmath75 and @xmath43 is shown in figs .  2 - 6 .",
    "the detailed comparisons of theory and simulations are presented separately for bulk and cluster systems below .",
    "casetti and macchi @xcite have calculated the curvature for bulk lj in a exponentially large energy range in order to detect the crossover between weakly and strongly chaotic regimes .",
    "earlier calculations by laviolette and stillinger @xcite of the mean curvature ( which is proportional to the squared einstein frequency ) show that @xmath44 increases linearly in the bulk lj system with a jump of about 20% at melting .",
    "this increase is a manifestation of the positive high - frequency tail in the instantaneous normal spectrum in the liquid phase .",
    "however , the slope in the liquid phase is smaller than the solid phase by about 6% .",
    "we find that the variance @xmath76 has a _ discontinuity _ at an energy @xmath77 . at energies well away from @xmath78 ,",
    "@xmath79 increases linearly with energy but in a very narrow range preceding @xmath78 , roughly corresponding to the solid ",
    "liquid coexistence region , @xmath79 increases sharply .",
    "as the system melts @xmath79 falls by about 30% .",
    "( the discontinuity in @xmath79 has been confirmed by repeating the calculations with longer trajectories and finer energy mesh .",
    "data in the coexistence region was computed from long trajectories of total time @xmath80 .",
    "care was taken to ensure that computed averages are over either solid or liquid phase exclusively . )",
    "this behaviour may be contrasted with the cusp singularity found recently in xy model in three dimensions by caiani _ et .",
    "@xcite which was interpreted as suggestive of a topological transition in the potential energy surface .",
    "the assumption of @xmath68correlated curvature fluctuation can be substantiated by examining the power spectra of curvature fluctuations .",
    "7 shows that these are satisfied in the bulk .",
    "however the observed correlation time does not agree with @xmath66 given in eq .",
    "[ tau ] ( see table 1 ) .",
    "we therefore use @xmath72 to calculate the relative contribution of unstable modes , namely _ u ( -)/. indeed @xmath81 is much better fit to than @xmath82 ( fig 2 ) .",
    "@xmath83 can become slightly negative in the solid phase ( implying some correction due to correlations ) , while in the liquid phase , it can be as large as 0.35 .",
    "assignment of the difference @xmath84 to the effect of unstable modes is justified by the following two observations .",
    "firstly , @xmath43 does not increase at melting ( it actually falls ) whereas has significant jump which can accounted for by an increase in the fraction of unstable modes .. in addition , the agreement of @xmath43 and is better at lower temperatures , namely when the occurrence of negative curvatures is infrequent .",
    "owing to the finiteness of cluster systems , correlations do not decay sufficiently rapidly @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "curvature fluctuations are far from being uncorrelated , and the framework of the geometric theory breaks down for such systems and deviations from eq .",
    "[ parametric ] can be expected .",
    "the observed correlation times do not agree with analytical estimates for @xmath66 and @xmath72 ( table 1 ) .",
    "the mean curvature for specific lj clusters has been computed previously @xcite , and in contrast to bulk , decreases uniformly with energy for all clusters ( except lj@xmath4 ) ; likewise for gupta clusters .",
    "no trend is apparent either for @xmath44 or its variation with energy , although there are some size effects in the case of gupta clusters .",
    "the behaviour of the variance , @xmath76 is more complex .",
    "although this quantity usually increases smoothly with energy , in the coexistence regime near melting there are large fluctuations which persist for very long averaging times .",
    "the liquid phase in lj@xmath4 also shows nonmonotonic dependence of variance on energy .",
    "the net result of the persistence of correlations is that the estimates @xmath43 for cluster systems do not agree with while @xmath82 is a rather good fit for lj clusters , it is of doubtful validity because @xmath66 is far from the observed fluctuation timescale @xmath85 ( table 1 ) . using @xmath72 in eq .",
    "[ parametric ] gives @xmath86 for lj clusters , although for the tightly bound gupta clusters , this discrepancy is smaller , @xmath87 .",
    "our results indicate that unstable modes have suppressed chaoticity in certain circumstances . in particular , in the solid lj system , where @xmath83 is very small , the fraction of unstable modes is substantial ( @xmath88 ) while slightly higher ( @xmath89 ) fraction of unstable modes in liquid gives greatly enhanced @xmath90 . in the cluster",
    "even after melting @xmath83 does not increase very much : it has smooth dependence on energy .",
    "a tentative conclusion that can be drawn from these cases is that the unstable modes have effective chaoticity only when the particles are free to execute large ",
    "scale motion .",
    "if the coarse  grained curvature is everywhere positive , the ratio @xmath91 provides a crude measure of the ruggedness or roughness of the underlying potential energy surface .",
    "as it is this feature which causes nearby trajectories to diverge , it is interesting to study the variation of this index with energy , as this will give some indication of the nature of the region that is being dynamically probed on the potential energy surface .    at low energies",
    "@xmath91 is small as expected , typical values being @xmath92 .",
    "at highest energies reached , it is between 0 .. 8 and 1.2 for various clusters with somewhat higher values for lj clusters and smaller @xmath0 . in the bulk system , a peak @xmath93",
    "is reached at the melting point ( from the solid phase ) and then it remains nearly constant .",
    "the correspondence of the maximal roughness with melting point is very suggestive .",
    "one can visualize destruction of the crystal lattice being driven by large scale roughness of the potential .",
    "in this paper we have examined the behaviour of the largest lyapunov exponent as a function of energy in finite clusters of 6 - 13 rare  gas and metal atoms , and in bulk rare  gas solids .",
    "these systems undergo a phase transition from a regime wherein the dynamics is purely oscillatory ( involving individual particle vibrations ) to a regime where the dynamics is both oscillatory as well as diffusive .",
    "diffusive dynamics is linked to the presence of delocalized unstable modes in the bulk @xcite . in small clusters",
    "the onset of the diffusion does not appear to enhance the chaoticity : the observed value of the lyapunov exponent is smaller compared to the value expected by a simple extrapolation of the exponent from the low energy regime , namely from the oscillatory dynamics or the `` solid '' phase .",
    "this suppression of chaos , which we attribute to the correlated hopping dynamics , is strongest for smallest clusters but is then progressively reduced .",
    "it is possible that for particular clusters , the enhancing and suppressing effects of the unstable modes can balance and @xmath29 curve is smooth across the melting ( infact lj@xmath94 shows no signature of melting according to this measure @xcite ) .",
    "this conjecture can be tested by studies of the larger clusters with calculations of the participation ratios of the unstable modes which will clarify their role in the chaoticity of a dynamical system .",
    "one may intuitively expect that unstable modes ( _ i .",
    "e.  _ negative curvatures ) cause the dynamics to be chaotic .",
    "as noted by dellago and posch in their study of melting in two dimensional systems@xcite , the fraction of unstable modes , which is a rough measure of negative curvatures , has a similar dependence on the parameters as these unstable modes can however become important only when particles are capable of large scale motion .",
    "( in a related context , it has been seen @xcite that falls when a liquid is cooled through its glass  transition temperature , namely as the unstable modes get localized @xcite . )    using the framework of a geometric theory of hamiltonian chaos , we compute an estimate for the lyapunov exponent from the curvature of the potential energy surface and its fluctuation . we have studied the variation of these quantities with the temperature of the system and found that the mean curvature is always a monotonic function of energy but the variance has a simple energy dependence only for smaller clusters . in the coexistence region of 13 particle clusters  these are the cases in which potential energy surface has a deep global minimum which is well separated from the next lowest structure@xmath79 is nonmonotonic .",
    "the lj bulk system shows singular behaviour for @xmath79 at melting , which may indicate some sort of topological change in the configuration space @xcite .",
    "the resulting estimate @xmath43 is generally larger than in the solid phase . for bulk , the discrepancy is small , but for clusters , the agreement is only qualitative .",
    "curvature fluctuations for clusters are correlated , and this effectively reduces the parametric instability in the dynamics .",
    "the spectral features of the curvature fluctuations such as bandwidth are not well accounted for by the geometric theory even for the bulk system . at higher temperatures",
    "@xmath43 is lower than which is attributed to the unstable modes ( negative curvatures ) which are ignored in the geometric theory .",
    "the contribution of the unstable modes towards chaoticity ( obtained by subtracting @xmath43 from and therefore only approximate ) is small in the solid phase but can be as large as one  third in the liquid phase . since @xmath79 and @xmath44 do not show any singularity at melting for clusters , the parametric contribution coming from the change in topography of the potential energy surface is changing smoothly .",
    "therefore , the fractional chaoticity coming from the unstable modes , @xmath83 , also seems to vary continuously with energy .    in summary ,",
    "our application of the geometric theory to the dynamics of the melting transition for cluster and bulk systems has provided a satisfactory qualitative understanding of the underlying mechanisms in terms of the change in roughness of the potential energy surface , curvature fluctuations and and parametric instability . while agreement between theory and simulation is reasonable for the bulk system , for the case of finite clusters , the situation is less satisfactory .",
    "the main source of the discrepancy seems to lie in the fact that in cluster systems , correlations are temporally long lived .",
    "this aspect requires to be incorporated within the present framework of the geometric theory ( see _ e. g. _ refs .",
    "@xcite ) in order to achieve quantitative accuracy .",
