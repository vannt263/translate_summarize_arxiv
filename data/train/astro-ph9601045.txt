    "ngc 4151 is a nearby syfert 1.5 galaxy .",
    "its x - ray spectrum is highly variable in both the 210 kev flux and the 210 kev spectral index ( e.g. yaqoob et al .",
    "the x - ray flux shows a good correlation with the uv flux ( perola et al .",
    "the spectrum is consistent with optically - thick thermal comptonization rather than highly - relativistic optically - thin one , which is characteristic for less variable spectra of syfert 1 s .",
    "we consider here the origin of the variability of ngc 4151 .",
    "zdziarski , johnson & magdziarz ( 1996 ) analyzed the broad - band x/@xmath0-ray spectra of ngc 4151 from contemporaneous observations ( fig .  1 ) , and they found that the data are well modelled with an intrinsic spectrum due to thermal comptonization ( titarchuk & mastichiadis 1994 ) .",
    "the x - ray energy spectral index changes from @xmath2 0.4 to 0.7 , and the temperature stays at @xmath1 50 kev .",
    "the spectra show no compton reflection component .",
    "other observations by osse up to dec .",
    "1993 also show that the observed spectra and fluxes are roughly constant and can be described by thermal comptonization at @xmath3 kev .",
    "the pattern of spectral variability can be described by varying x - ray power law pivoting at @xmath1 100 kev ( cf .",
    "fig  1 ) .",
    "the spectrum breaks at that energy permitting the @xmath0-ray flux to stay approximately constant .",
    "we also reanalyzed x - ray observations from _ iue _ /_exosat _ campaigns in 1983 nov .",
    "719 and 1984 dec .",
    "161985 jan .  2 ( perola et al .  1986 ) .",
    "refitting of the _ exosat _ data with a power law and a constant soft excess component resulted in a correlation close to linear between the absorption - corrected @xmath4 at 5 kev and at 8.5 ev ( from @xmath5 de - reddened observations ; ulrich et al .",
    "1991 ) , which values are comparable .",
    "the uv / x - ray correlation can be explained by two specific models with reprocessing of x - rays by cold matter ( zdziarski & magdziarz 1996 ) .",
    "the first one is based on reemision of the x - ray flux absorbed by thomson - thin clouds in the line of sight .",
    "the clouds are dense enough for almost complete termalization .",
    "the model predicts no compton reflection which is consistent with the broad - band spectra .",
    "the second model assumes reprocessing of x - rays and @xmath0-rays by a cold , optically - thick accretion disk with dissipative patchy corona .",
    "the absorbed radiation is reemitted locally in uv as a blackbody .",
    "the homogeneous corona model is ruled out because the hardness of the x - ray spectrum implies that the plasma is photon starved .",
    "our second model predicts compton reflection marginally allowed by the observations .",
    "both models satisfy the energy balance and provide good fits to the x/@xmath0-rays and uv data .",
    "the transmission model ( fig .  2 ) predicts : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the integrated uv flux , @xmath8 = 0.05 kev @xmath9 s@xmath10 is a residual uv flux , and the factor @xmath11 = 0.60 takes into account incomplete covering of the x-@xmath0 source by the clouds as well as an efficiency of the absorbed flux conversion into the blackbody continuum .",
    "we determined the temperature of the absorber as @xmath12 3 ev from the average observed spectral index in the uv between 8.5 and 7.2 ev ( @xmath13 = -0.15 ; perola & piro 1994 ) . the typical column density of a cloud in the partial covering absorber is @xmath14 @xmath9 with the typical covering factor of @xmath15 .",
    "the size of a single cloud is @xmath16 .",
    "the average size of the entire absorber is @xmath17 cm , which satisfy the limit @xmath18 cm from the relative uv / x - ray time delay ( warwick et al .",
    "the parameters of the absorber are similar to those studied by ferland & rees ( 1988 ) and guilbert & rees ( 1988 ) .    in the reflection model",
    "we assume that all dissipation takes place in the corona ( e.g. svensson & zdziarski 1994 ) .",
    "we integrate the blackbody emission over the disk surface with the standard disk dissipation rate ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "this relates the observed 8.5 ev flux to the total uv flux as a function of @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the schwarzschild radius , and @xmath21 is a cosine of the disk inclination angle .",
    "the model predicts @xmath22 , where a is an albedo for the total x-@xmath0 flux , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is a ratio of the corona emission intercepted by the disk to the luminosity emitted outward .",
    "compton reflection for @xmath25 0.5 is consistent with the broad - band spectra .",
    "we find that all @xmath26 cm ( or equivalently @xmath27 0.15 ) fit the uv spectral indices ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath20 = 1.3 @xmath28 @xmath29 cm ( for @xmath30 0.21 ) provides the best fit to uv fluxes .",
