    "<S> we present a two - current - pulse temporal correlation experiment to study the intrinsic subnanosecond nonequilibrium magnetic dynamics of a nanomagnet during and following a pulse excitation . </S>",
    "<S> this method is applied to a model spin - transfer system , a spin valve nanopillar with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> two - pulses separated by a short delay ( @xmath0 ps ) are shown to lead to the same switching probability as a single pulse with a duration that depends on the delay . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrates a remarkable symmetry between magnetic excitation and relaxation and provides a direct measurement of the magnetic relaxation time . </S>",
    "<S> the results are consistent with a simple finite temperature fokker - planck macrospin model of the dynamics , suggesting more coherent magnetization dynamics in this short time nonequilibrium limit than near equilibrium .    the control of magnetization on short timescales has become an area of intense research and many methods are used to excite a magnetic system , including spin - currents  @xcite , magnetic fields  @xcite and optical pulses  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it also has recently become possible to drive individual nanometer scale magnetic elements far from equilibrium using spin - currents and probe their dynamical response . however , most electronic transport studies focus on the excitation during the drive pulses @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> less is known about the relaxation processes following a pulse excitation . </S>",
    "<S> yet , this is very important for fundamental and practical reasons . </S>",
    "<S> first , the time scales of the relaxation far from equilibrium are not known and may differ from those determined in experiments that probe low amplitude magnetic excitations , such as ferromagnetic resonance . </S>",
    "<S> second , these time scales determine the speed at which nanomagnets can be written and read in magnetic memories , including in spin - transfer torque magnetic random access memories ( stt - mram ) .    </S>",
    "<S> it is now well known that spin - polarized currents and spin - transfer torques ( stts ) can reverse the direction of the magnetization on subnanosecond timescales @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , many experimental methods have been developed to study spin - transfer switching in both spin valves and magnetic tunnel junctions ( mtjs ) . </S>",
    "<S> while mtjs are promising for applications because of their large magnetoresistive ( mr ) readout signals ( @xmath1% ) , all - metallic spin valves permit one to apply much larger currents and thus can be driven farther away from equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> direct single - shot time - resolved electrical measurements have been carried out in mtjs  @xcite , but have not been reported in spin valve nanopillars , because of their low impedance and small magnetoresistance ( mr ) ( @xmath2% ) , which results in their switching signals being to small for nanosecond measurements . </S>",
    "<S> further , time - resolved stt measurements are insensitive to the magnetization dynamics after the excitation , as the excitation current is the source of the electrical readout signal . therefore , </S>",
    "<S> to time - resolve the relaxation dynamics , a different experimental method is needed .    </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we present an all - electrical two - pulse correlation method that yields quantitative information on the form and timescales of magnetic excitation and relaxation , with time resolution . </S>",
    "<S> this method is applied to a model spin - transfer system , a spin valve nanopillar with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> two - pulses separated by a short delay ( @xmath0 ps ) are shown to lead to the same switching probability as a single pulse with a duration that depends on the delay  demonstrating a remarkable symmetry between magnetic excitation and relaxation  and providing a direct measurement of the magnetic relaxation time . </S>",
    "<S> the observed symmetry is shown to be consistent with a finite temperature macrospin model .        </S>",
    "<S> the system we studied has two stable magnetic states @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which are nearly degenerate in equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in how the system relaxes to these states after being excited by a spin - polarized current . </S>",
    "<S> the basic idea of our method is to compare the switching probability of two pulses separated by a delay much longer than the magnetic relaxation time to that of a composite pulse , i.e. two pulses separated by a short delay . with a composite pulse , </S>",
    "<S> the first pulse alters the magnetic state on a time scale that changes the dynamics excited by the second pulse . by choosing the amplitudes and polarities of the first and second pulse we can study different aspects of the relaxation processes . for example , to study the relaxation back to the initial state ( i.e. state @xmath3 ) after a pulse , we can apply two pulses with identical polarities that both would be of the appropriate polarity to switch the sample from state @xmath3 to @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> if the delay is much longer than the relaxation time @xmath5 , the two pulses can be considered to be independent events and the total probability of switching from state @xmath3 to state @xmath4 is : @xmath6 here @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the switching probabilities from state @xmath3 to @xmath4 for the first , the second and for both pulses combined and we have assumed no reverse switching during the measurement , i.e. @xmath10 . if @xmath11 is within the relaxation time of the system , the total switching probability will increase compared to eq .  : @xmath12 using these equations we can resolve the relaxation dynamics of the sample by measuring and comparing the switching probabilities as a function of @xmath11 @xcite .    our sample is a spin - valve nanopillar consisting of a nico free layer and exchange coupled nico and copt multilayers as the reference layer , both of which have perpendicular magnetization anisotropy ( pma ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( for the full layer stack see @xcite . ) </S>",
    "<S> such pma samples have a simple uniaxial anisotropy energy landscape that permits a direct comparison to theoretical models . the sample presented in this work is @xmath13{nm}\\times\\unit[100]{nm}$ ] in size , fabricated by e - beam and optical lithography @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have studied more that @xmath14 samples of different shapes and sizes and found similar results . </S>",
    "<S> the equilibrium states are antiparallel ( @xmath15 ap ) and parallel ( @xmath16 p ) magnetization alignment of the free and reference layers and there is @xmath17 mr , well within the accuracy of our method . </S>",
    "<S> the room temperature coercive field is @xmath13{mt}$ ] , large enough so that no reverse switching occurs @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the zero temperature switching current for antiparallel ( ap ) to parallel ( p ) switching is @xmath18{ma}$ ] .    </S>",
    "<S> we use an arbitrary waveform generator to apply two pulses separated by a time delay @xmath11 , as illustrated by the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the state of the spin valve is determined by a resistance measurement using a lock - in amplifier both before and after the injection of the double - current pulse . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the lock - in current is small enough ( ) not to affect the spin valves and not to induce reverse switching @xcite . all experiments described here were conducted at room temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> initially the sample was brought into the ap state by the application of an easy - axis magnetic field of appropriate direction and magnitude . a short current pulse of positive polarity @xmath19{ma}$ ] and @xmath20{ns}$ ] </S>",
    "<S> was then applied . </S>",
    "<S> a longer pulse of positive polarity would eventually switch the sample into the p state ( as @xmath21 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the duration has been chosen such that the switching probability is nearly zero ( @xmath22 ) , as shown by the dashed curve ( i.e. the single pulse curve ) in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](a ) at . after a variable delay from to </S>",
    "<S> , a second pulse with the same amplitude ( @xmath23 ) and a variable duration @xmath24 , from to , was applied . </S>",
    "<S> the total switching probability distribution @xmath25 was then measured by repeating the process @xmath26 to @xmath27 times for each pulse set .    as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](a ) , for delays longer than the switching probability distribution is the same as that of the second pulse alone @xmath28 , which is consistent with eq .   for @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that these delays are longer than the magnetization relaxation time . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetization state excited by a current pulse decays to equilibrium in under , within our experimental accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> however , for delays less than , the switching probability @xmath25 is larger than that of just a single pulse .    remarkably , even with a composite pulse , the switching probability versus the second pulse duration is seen to follow the same functional form as that for a single pulse </S>",
    "<S> this is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](b ) , where the probability data , shifted by an amount @xmath30  a quantity that depends on the delay between the pulses  is seen to closely overlap . </S>",
    "<S> this clearly demonstrates that the switching probability of a composite pulse ( @xmath31 ) is equal to that of a single pulse with an increased duration ( @xmath32 ) . </S>",
    "<S> since this is satisfied for all @xmath24 , a natural conclusion is that the ensemble averaged state of the sample after the first pulse and the delay ( @xmath33 ) is the same as that after a single pulse with a duration of @xmath34 , as illustrated schematically by the pulse shapes in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](b ) .    from the data shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] we determine @xmath34 as a function of the delay @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> this is shown as crosses in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the black solid curve is an exponential fit to the data where @xmath35 is the lifetime of the excitation : @xmath36 with the parameters @xmath37{ns}$ ] and @xmath38{ns}$ ] . for no delay , @xmath39 , clearly @xmath40 and thus @xmath41 , which is indeed fulfilled within the time resolution of the experiment ( @xmath42 ps ) . </S>",
    "<S> eq .   </S>",
    "<S> links the duration of the excitation , the delay and the corresponding equivalent pulse duration , which is related to the magnetization relaxation rate .     versus delay @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the blue crosses are determined from the experimental data in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the black solid curve is an exponential fit to eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> the green dash - dotted line is a calculation from the llg equation for @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the red dashed curve is a calculation based on a fokker - planck analysis ( eq .  ) . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the data in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] is unexpected at first , as a zero temperature macrospin landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) model predicts a linear relationship between @xmath34 and @xmath44 , as shown by the green dash - dotted line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> this linear relationship follows from the llg equation . </S>",
    "<S> for a uniaxial nanomagnet in zero applied magnetic field , the polar angle of the magnetization @xmath45 , i.e. the angle between the magnetization and the easy axis , satisfies @xcite : @xmath46 with : @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 is the relaxation time due to damping and depends on the material parameters , the anisotropy field @xmath50 , the gilbert damping parameter @xmath51 and the gyromagnetic ratio @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath49 is typically hundreds of picoseconds . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath53 is the zero temperature critical current as we mentioned earlier , representing the threshold current for switching . </S>",
    "<S> it depends on the magnetization density @xmath54 , the nanomagnet s volume @xmath55 and the spin polarization of the current @xmath56 . from eq .   </S>",
    "<S> both excitation ( @xmath57 ) and relaxation ( @xmath58 ) follow the same functional form for small angles @xmath45 and are only different in their respective time constants . </S>",
    "<S> it is straightforward to show that the duration of a single pulse ( @xmath34 ) , which brings the sample to the same state as the first pulse ( @xmath59 ) followed by the delay ( @xmath11 ) satisfies : @xmath60 hence the initial slope of @xmath34 versus @xmath11 , shown as the green dashed dotted curve in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] , depends on the current overdrive , @xmath61 , and provides an independent method to determine the zero temperature critical current . </S>",
    "<S> however , for long delays this equation is unphysical , as it predicts a negative @xmath34 .    </S>",
    "<S> a physical picture is that during the first pulse the magnetization evolves from a thermal distribution of initial angles near the north pole ( @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the energy barrier and @xmath64 is the thermal energy ) to a larger angle @xmath65 . during the delay , and </S>",
    "<S> provided @xmath66 , the polar angle decays back toward the north pole . </S>",
    "<S> however , in this zero temperature model the magnetization decays back to @xmath67 , i.e. to an angle that can be less than the initial angle , @xmath68 .        </S>",
    "<S> the difference between the llg model prediction and the experimental results can be explained by thermal fluctuations both during the excitation and relaxation processes . as is well known , thermal fluctuations lead to a spread of the initial angles of magnetization about the north pole . </S>",
    "<S> a spin - current pulse works to rotate the magnetization away from the easy axis direction and , in essence , amplifies these magnetization fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> once the magnetization deviates from the easy axis direction , the magnetization polar angle grows exponentially . </S>",
    "<S> however , thermal noise also slows down the relaxation from a simple exponential decay process predicted by the llg equations and leads to relaxation to a thermal distribution . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , thermal fluctuations not only change the timescales of the excitation and relaxation processes , they also alter their functional forms .    to model the influence of thermal fluctuations </S>",
    "<S> , we simulated the double pulse measurement using the fokker - planck equation @xcite , which has the following form for a uniaxial macrospin system : @xmath69 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac{1}{2\\xi\\tau_d}\\frac{\\partial ^ 2 \\mathcal{p}}{\\partial \\theta ^ 2 } \\label{eq : fp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is the probability density of the magnetization at the angle @xmath45 and the time @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath72 is the dimensionless energy barrier , @xmath73 . for a uniaxial nanomagnet @xmath74 .    </S>",
    "<S> we start with a boltzmann distribution centered around the easy axis in the ap state : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a normalization constant so that @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> for the simulation we use a fixed duration for the first pulse of , the same as in our experiments and vary the duration of the second pulse for different delays . by fitting the measured single pulse switching probability distribution ( i.e. the red dashed curve of fig .  [ fig:1](a ) ) to eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath78 and @xmath79{ps}$ ] .    </S>",
    "<S> we then can track the ensemble averaged magnetization projection , @xmath80 as a function of time @xmath71 , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fp](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the shaded region depicts the angular range containing @xmath81 to @xmath82 of the states . during the first current pulse ( @xmath83{ns } \\leq t \\leq \\unit[0.9]{ns}$ ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , the switching process begins . </S>",
    "<S> the averaged magnetization projection decreases while the occupation probability distribution spreads out , where the majority of the distribution is still centered around @xmath84 . during the delay ( @xmath85{ns } \\leq t \\leq \\unit[1.9]{ns}$ ] ) , the averaged magnetization projection increases while the occupation probability distribution narrows toward the initial state . </S>",
    "<S> then during the second pulse ( @xmath86{ns}$ ] ) , the averaged magnetization projection decreases again as the total distribution expands during the beginning part of the switching process .    </S>",
    "<S> we can further check whether a pulse and a delay ( @xmath33 ) brings the system into the same state as a single @xmath34 duration pulse . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fp](b ) shows the occupation probability as a function of the polar angle for different delay times . </S>",
    "<S> the distributions for a pulse and delay @xmath87 ( the solid light blue curves in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fp](b ) ) overlap with those of a single @xmath34 pulse ( dashed curves in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fp](b))which is consistent with scaling of the experimental data shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](b ) </S>",
    "<S> .    the fokker - planck simulation results also agree quantitatively with the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fp](c ) the calculated switching probability distributions have the same form independent of @xmath11 and can be shifted in time to coincide . </S>",
    "<S> the results shifts , @xmath34s , are in good agreement with the experimental results , as indicated by the red dashed curve in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between the llg and the fokker - planck analysis clearly shows the influence of the thermal fluctuations , even though the total process ( excitation plus relaxation ) lasts less than .    in summary , we have presented a method ideally suited to study excitation and relaxation in a magnetic nanostructure . </S>",
    "<S> this method only requires the generation of pulses with short durations and delays and measurement of the switching probability . it does not require resolving small signal changes at high bandwidth and it can also be used to study dynamics after a pulse , with no current applied .    </S>",
    "<S> our method provides a direct ( model independent ) measurement of the relaxation timescale by considering when two events are correlated . </S>",
    "<S> we have used this method to study excitation and relaxation in a model system  a thin film nanomagnet with uniaxial anisotropy excited by spin - current pulses . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that a single pulse followed by a delay leaves a nanomagnet in a state with the same ensemble average as that of a single pulse with a shorter duration @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> this finding is also model - independent . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath34s are seen to decrease exponentially , following the form of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : fitting ] , and giving a relaxation time of @xmath88{ps}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the relaxation time is more typically obtained experimentally by fitting to an arrhenius - nel s model with a variable prefactor ( see , for example , @xcite ) . in general </S>",
    "<S> , the decay of the magnetization might be expected to be more complex than a simple exponential ( eq .  [ eq : fitting ] ) , including multiple relaxation pathways with different timescales . however , even in such a case the directly measured relationship between @xmath34 and @xmath11 would provide information that is important for understanding such relaxation processes . </S>",
    "<S> using eq .   with an anisotropy field of @xmath89 t </S>",
    "<S> ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) and a gyromagnetic ratio of @xmath90(ts ) ( i.e. a land g - facto of @xmath91 ) , we find a gilbert damping of @xmath92 , a value that is larger than that determined from thin film ferromagnetic resonance measurements of the damping ( @xmath93 @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the larger damping inferred from the data may be a consequence of the large - angle excitation of the magnetization , including non - linear effects @xcite , or to changes of the magnet s material properties associated with device nanofabrication @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , our results can be understood within a simple macrospin model that incorporates thermal fluctuations . in fitting our data to this model </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a dimensionless energy barrier of @xmath78 , which is within 25% of that expected based on the volume , magnetization and anisotropy of the nanomagnet ( @xmath94 ) . our previous results , as well as </S>",
    "<S> those of many other groups , have found energy barriers to reversal for long field  @xcite and long current pulses ( @xmath95 ns )  @xcite to be only a small fraction of that expected for a macrospin , suggesting the reversal proceeds by subvolume nucleation  @xcite . for similar samples , we found that the energy barrier to reversal under long current pulses to be @xmath96{k_bt}$ ]  @xcite , @xmath97 the macrospin value . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the reversal modes in the short - time nonequilibrium limit are distinct from those in the long - time limit , as the system may not have time to follow minimum energy paths or be driven from these paths by the spin transfer torque . </S>",
    "<S> the fundamental explanation is an open question . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that the dependency of the effective energy barrier on pulse amplitude can be further studied by our method with different pulse conditions . </S>",
    "<S> our double pulse method , which provides access to the intrinsic time scales of the excitation and relaxation dynamics , can be used in other cases where the readout signal is also small , such as current induced domain wall motion . </S>"
