    "the collection of random graphs to which this result applies includes the case when @xmath1 is a galton - watson tree with an offspring distribution , @xmath7 say , that is aperiodic ( in particular , it is not supported on a proper subgroup of @xmath8 ) , critical ( mean one ) , and has finite variance , conditioned on its total progeny being equal to @xmath2 .",
    "motivated by the problem of extending the methods of @xcite to deal with the case when the finite variance assumption is dropped , in this article we prove convergence results for the simple random walks on a much broader class of graph trees .",
    "although the overall structure of the argument used here closely matches that of @xcite , in that article several rather precise properties of the brownian continuum random tree were applied , meaning that extensions to more general limiting trees could not be made immediately . here ,",
    "new techniques are introduced to allow us to remove some of the restrictions of @xcite , and in particular prove a scaling limit result for the simple random walks on critical galton - watson trees with infinite variance offspring distributions .",
    "denote the brownian continuum random tree and its canonical measure by @xmath9 ( see @xcite for background ) .",
    "let @xmath10 be a distinguished vertex of @xmath11 and call it the root of @xmath11 .",
    "suppose @xmath12 is the minimal subtree of @xmath11 spanning @xmath10 and a @xmath13-sample of @xmath14-random vertices ; such sets can be constructed so that @xmath15 , and also we can assume that @xmath16 is dense in @xmath11 , because @xmath14 has full - support , almost - surely .",
    "the set @xmath12 consists of a finite number of finite length line segments and therefore we can well - define the one - dimensional hausdorff measure on @xmath12 normalised to be a probability measure , @xmath17 say . in @xcite ,",
    "the fact that @xmath17 converges weakly to @xmath14 as probability measures on @xmath11 was used in a time - change argument to show that certain brownian motions on the subtrees @xmath12 converge to the brownian motion on the brownian continuum random tree ( @xcite , lemma 3.1 ) .",
    "whilst this assumption is known to hold for the brownian continuum random tree , it has not been established for the related @xmath4-stable trees , @xmath18 , that are the scaling limits of infinite variance galton - watson trees ( see @xcite , section 4 , for a brief introduction to @xmath4-stable trees and this convergence result ) . by considering alternative brownian motions on @xmath12 ,",
    "we are able to show that the assumption that @xmath17 converges to @xmath14 is redundant ( proposition [ prockconv ] is the relevant convergence result ) .",
    "to proceed as we do , however , we are required to check that the time - change additive functionals we consider satisfy a tightness property ( lemma [ akprops ] ) , and our proof of this relies on the technical result that the local times of the brownian motion on the limiting tree diverge uniformly ( lemma [ ltdiverge ] ) .    a second fact about the brownian continuum random tree applied in @xcite",
    "is that it has no vertex of degree greater than three , by which we mean that the number of connected components of @xmath19 is no greater than three for any @xmath20 .",
    "this property was important because it meant that the graph trees @xmath21 constructed analogously to @xmath12 eventually had to have the same ` tree - shape ' as @xmath12 as @xmath2 became large .",

    "our argument involves considering approximations to the processes of interest that jump over branch - points , so that the precise geometry of the trees at branch - points is not seen by the approximations .    specifically , the limit space @xmath22 that we study in this article is the collection of pairs @xmath9 , where @xmath23 is a compact real tree ( see @xcite , definition 2.1 , for example ) and @xmath14 is a non - atomic borel probability measure on @xmath11 that satisfies @xmath24 for some @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the open ball of radius @xmath27 ( with respect to the metric @xmath28 ) centred at @xmath20 .",

    ", this implies that @xmath776 is also continuous on @xmath236 .",
    "consequently , we obtain from proposition [ prockconv ] that @xmath777 is a measurable map on @xmath236 . given this , and noting that under the assumptions of the theorem that @xmath778 , @xmath74-a.s .",
    ", checking the existence of a unique probability measure satisfying ( [ pdef ] ) is straightforward .",
    "the construction of @xmath88 is similar , but easier .",
    "finally , to check that @xmath779 , we consider a skorohod - type coupling of random variables .",
    "in particular , since the relevant spaces are separable , if @xmath95 converges in distribution to @xmath75 , then there exists a probability space upon which random variables @xmath780 and @xmath781 are defined in such a way that @xmath782 has the distribution of @xmath87 for each @xmath2 , @xmath781 has the distribution of @xmath72 and @xmath783 , almost - surely .",

    "suppose @xmath785 is a non - negative integer - valued random variable that is aperiodic , has mean one , and is in the domain of attraction of a stable law with index @xmath18 , by which we mean that there exists a sequence @xmath786 such that @xmath787-n}{a_n}\\buildrel{d}\\over{\\rightarrow } \\xi,\\ ] ] where @xmath788 $ ] is the sum of @xmath2 independent copies of @xmath785 and the limit random variable satisfies @xmath789 .",
    "if @xmath5 is a family of random trees such that @xmath1 is a galton - watson tree with offspring distribution @xmath785 , conditioned on the total progeny being equal to @xmath2 , then it is known ( see @xcite , theorem 3.1 ) that the associated rescaled search - depth processes @xmath790 converge in distribution to a random excursion @xmath75 with law @xmath791 , say .",
    "the corresponding random real tree @xmath11 is the @xmath4-stable tree conditioned to have total mass equal to one , and we denote its law by @xmath792 ( see also @xcite , section 4 ) .",
