    "recently , it has become possible to perform single - molecule experiments . @xcite in such single - molecule experiments or small chemical systems such as cells , it is expected that ` fluctuation ' plays an important role because mean values and fluctuations ( deviations ) of observables are in the same order .",
    "@xcite it also becomes possible to measure flux distributions experimentally in such small systems .",
    "@xcite when the fluctuation is large , the traditional rate equation approach is not adequate for the study of stochastic systems because it treats only average values in large size limit .",
    "hence , the stochastic behavior of chemical reaction systems should be treated by a master equation approach . @xcite",
    "although it is difficult to obtain exact solutions of master equations in general , it is important to evaluate ( even approximately ) not only the mean values , but also the fluctuations .",
    "there is a phenomenon , known as a _ pumping _ , in which a system under a periodic perturbation causes a finite flux in a preferred direction .",
    "for example , a classical michaelis - menten ( mm ) enzymatic mechanism under a periodic perturbation has been studied experimentally and theoretically .",
    "it has been revealed that the periodic perturbation activates a pumping mode in the mm system .",
    "@xcite that is , the periodic perturbation causes a current which is not explained by a simple average of those in the strict static cases .",
    "the concept of the pump current is also related to molecular motors and brownian ratchets . @xcite .",
    "the average current can be calculated by various methods . @xcite in addition , it has been indicated that a calculation of the net current in the brownian ratchets shows a similar mathematical structure to that of the geometric phase in quantum mechanics .",
    "@xcite recently , an explicit connection between the statistics of the current flow and the berry phase interpretation has been proposed .",
    "@xcite the total current is divided into the so - called ` classical ' current and ` pump ' current .",
    "sinitsyn and nemenman have shown that the dynamical and the berry phase correspond to the classical and pump current , respectively .",
    "@xcite one of the other remarkable progresses is that it becomes possible to calculate not only the average current , but also the fluctuation about the current for an ` adiabatic ' cases . here",
    ", the ` adiabatic ' means that the oscillation of the periodic perturbation is very slow .",
    "although the average current has already been observed experimentally , @xcite any experiment for the fluctuation has not been performed .",
    "however , recent progress of experimental techniques @xcite would make it possible to observe the flux distribution for the pumping phenomena directly .",
    "detailed information for non - equilibrium systems is useful to construct the non - equilibrium statistical mechanics and non - equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "@xcite in order to investigate such non - equilibrium systems experimentally , theoretical predictions would become a guideline for experimentalists .    in the present paper ,",
    "we give a calculation scheme for the statistics of the current , especially in ` non - adiabatic ' cases .",
    "the fluctuation about the average current in the non - adiabatic cases has not been calculated yet .",
    "in addition , the non - adiabatic region is of great interest because a stochastic resonance - like phenomenon has been observed experimentally in such non - adiabatic region .",
    "@xcite one of our main results is that there is no stochastic resonance - like behavior for the fluctuation about the average current . in order to calculate the statistics ,",
    "we develop a calculation scheme based on the non - adiabatic geometrical phase ( aharonov - anandan phase @xcite ) .",
    "we have already proposed a method for direct evaluation of the aharonov - anandan phase by means of a perturbation calculation for _ eigenvectors _ of a floquet hamiltonian .",
    "@xcite here , we show that a perturbation calculation for _ eigenvalues _ of a floquet hamiltonian gives the total statistics directly ; the calculation scheme is simpler than that in ref",

    "the present paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we explain the stochastic model for the pumping phenomenon , which has been introduced by sinitsyn and nemenman .",
    "@xcite in sec .",
    "iii , we review a geometrical phase interpretation for the pumping phenomenon .",
    "we develop an analytical treatment for the calculation of the total current with the aid of the floquet theory and the perturbation calculation in sec .",
    "section v gives concluding remarks .",
    "we mainly focus on a simple stochastic system with two absorbing states , which has been introduced in ref .",
    "the classical stochastic system is described as follows : @xmath0 \\leftrightarrows [ \\mathrm{c } ] \\leftrightarrows [ \\mathrm{r}].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the system consists of three parts .",
    "two absorbing states are denoted as @xmath1 $ ] and @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "these absorbing states may be interpreted in many ways : they correspond to substrate and product in a mm enzymatic reaction , or cellular compartments , and so on .",
    "these absorbing states exchange molecules or particles via an intermediate container @xmath3 $ ] . the container @xmath3 $ ] can contain either zero or one particle in it .",
    "when the container is filled with one particle , the particle can escape from the container by jumping into one of the two absorbing states , @xmath1 $ ] or @xmath2 $ ] . on the contrary , when the container is empty , either of the absorbing states can emit a new particle into the container . for simplicity , we here consider the following kinetic rates : @xmath4 \\rightarrow [ \\mathrm{c } ] : & k_1 = c_1 + r \\cos ( \\omega t),\\\\ \\textrm{(ii ) }   & [ \\mathrm{l } ] \\leftarrow [ \\mathrm{c } ] : & k_{-1 } = c_{-1 } , \\\\",
    "\\textrm{(iii ) } & [ \\mathrm{c } ] \\rightarrow [ \\mathrm{r } ] : & k_2 = c_2 , \\\\",
    "\\textrm{(iv ) }   & [ \\mathrm{c } ] \\leftarrow [ \\mathrm{r } ] : & k_{-2 } = c_{-2 } + r \\sin ( \\omega t ) ,   \\end{array}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are positive real numbers , and @xmath7 is the amplitude of the perturbative oscillation .",
    "the above kinetic rates indicate that only two kinetic rates ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) oscillate with time at a frequency @xmath10 .",
    "note that the current @xmath11 at static cases ( @xmath12 ) , in which all kinetic rates are constant , is easily calculated from @xcite @xmath13 we here describe the current @xmath11 as _",
    "classical current_. one might think that the time average of the current over a cyclic perturbation is simply given by the time average of the classical current @xmath11 , but it is not true .",
    "for example , when @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the time average of @xmath11 gives zero .",
    "however , even in the simple case , a net current is actually observed .",
    "such additional current is called a _",
    "pump current_. the problem considered here is to calculate the _ total _ current which includes both classical and pump currents .",
    "our main goal is to calculate the net current between @xmath3 $ ] and @xmath2 $ ] in the steady state . in order to calculate the current ,",
    "we use a method similar to the full counting statistics .",

    "16 and 23 , the characteristic function of @xmath16 is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the unit vector , @xmath26 stands for the time - ordering operator , and @xmath27.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in eq .",
    ", @xmath28 is called the counting field , and the derivatives of @xmath29 give cumulants of @xmath16 , e.g. , @xmath30 .",
    "hence , the problem for calculating the current is actually the evaluation of the characteristic function @xmath31 ( or @xmath29 ) .      from eq .",
    ", it is easy to see that the characteristic function @xmath31 is related to a solution of the following differential equation : @xmath32 because the final state @xmath33 at time @xmath18 is formally calculated from @xmath34 \\mathbf{p}(0).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the normalization condition of the probability @xmath35 , we obtain the identity @xmath36 .",
    "hence , the total current @xmath37 and its derivative @xmath38 are given by @xmath39 although the existence of such cyclic state has not been mathematically justified in general cases , we checked numerically that the stochastic system reaches a steady cyclic state , starting from arbitrary initial conditions .",
    "note that when @xmath40 , eq .   simply gives a master equation for the time evolution of the system , and hence @xmath41 due to the cyclic evolution of the system .",
    "we here use an analogy between the classical stochastic system and a quantum mechanical formulation . replacing the time evolution operator @xmath42 by @xmath43",
    ", we obtain the following shr \" odinger - like equation : @xcite @xmath44 the time evolution operator @xmath45 is constructed as @xmath46 when we take the initial state @xmath47 as a cyclic state , we have @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a phase factor .",
    "hence , the state vector @xmath50 is an eigenstate of the time evolution operator @xmath45 , and the phase factor @xmath49 is related to its eigenvalue .    from this replacement , the problem of calculation of the total current and its fluctuation",
    "is replaced by the evaluation of the phase factor @xmath49 for eq .  .",
    "note that the ` hamiltonian ' @xmath51 is a non - hermitian operator , which is different from the usual quantum mechanics .",

    "@xcite the fundamental matrix @xmath64 is useful for the fourier analysis .",
    "since @xmath65 and @xmath66 are both fundamental matrices of @xmath51 , there exists a constant invertible matrix @xmath67 with @xmath68 .",
    "@xcite because @xmath53 , we have @xmath69 .",
    "hence , we obtain @xmath70 and @xmath71 here , we can make identifications @xmath72 and @xmath73 . using the above identifications and @xmath74 we obtain @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the eigenvector of @xmath63 .",
    "although the matrix @xmath63 may not be taken as a diagonal matrix in some convenient bases in general cases , in our case the matrix @xmath63 can be diagonalized .",

    "the ` state part ' means that the hamiltonian is expressed as @xmath82 matrix and hence the eigenvector of the hamiltonian has two components ( states ) . in our case",

    ", we set @xmath112 . the total",
    "current shows a peak at a certain frequency @xmath113 , which has been also observed experimentally .",
    "@xcite in the experiment in ref .  7 , na@xmath114 pumping mode of ( na , k)-atpase by an oscillating electric field has been studied .",
    "because different conformations of the protein have different dipole moments , an oscillating electric field could drive structural change of the protein and hence cause the modulation of kinetic parameters .",
    "the actual dependency of the kinetic parameters on the external field could be very complicated , and we assume that two of the kinetic rates depend on the oscillating field in our model .",
    "our model is a very simplified one , so that the quantitative comparison with the experimental results may be difficult .",
    "however , the qualitative behavior is the same as the experimental one : there is one peak , and it decays as @xmath115 for @xmath116 .",
    "@xcite hence , we believe that our model catches the feature of the pumping phenomenon .",
    "second , the perturbation varies the fluctuation of the total current , too .",
    "while it is possible to evaluate the total current by various analytical methods , @xcite to our knowledge , the fluctuation has not been calculated explicitly for a long time . in adiabatic cases ,",

[ fig_result](b ) shows no peak : the fluctuation increases monotonically with the frequency @xmath10 , and approaches to the value of the non - perturbative case ( in this case , @xmath117 ) .    finally , we comment on the relationship between the present calculation and the aharonov - anandan phase . because the second order correction vanishes when we set @xmath102",
    ", one might consider that all the second order correction stems from the aharonov - anandan phase .",
    "however , it is not true . for the simplest case with @xmath111 ,",
    "the classical current is zero , and the non - zero total current of eq",
    ".   stems from the aharonov - anandan phase .",
    "in contrast , the fluctuation calculated from the aharonov - anandan phase becomes zero , so that the second order term in eq",
    ".   is induced from the dynamical phase . in summary ,",
    "the second order correction does not stem from only the aharonov - anandan phase , but also the dynamical phase . if one wants to know only the ` pumping ' current and its fluctuation , one more calculation for the aharonov - anandan phase is needed .",
    "in this work , we gave a unified theory for the calculation of the total current and its fluctuation in classical stochastic systems under a periodic perturbation of the kinetic rates .",
    "the formulation is based on the full counting statistics and the non - adiabatic geometrical phase .",
    "it was clarified that the total current is easily obtained by the combination of the floquet theory and a simple perturbation calculation .",
    "although it is possible to calculate the aharonov - anandan phase directly , @xcite the calculation is a little complicated . in a practical sense ,",
    "the total current would be important , and as shown in this work , the total current is easily obtained only by the perturbation calculation for the eigenvalues of the floquet hamiltonian ; the calculation is easier than the direct evaluation of the aharonov - anandan phase .",
    "hence , the formulation given in the present paper gives a useful analytical method for the calculation of the current in the non - adiabatic cases .",
    "since our model is a simplified one , we can obtain the analytical expressions for the total current and its fluctuation .",
    "although it may be difficult to compare the simple model and real experiments , an important theoretical prediction is that there is no peak structure for the current fluctuation , which is different from the behavior of the average current .",
    "the simple model can predict the qualitative behavior for the average current ( one peak and the decay @xmath115 ) adequately , so that we expect that the qualitative behavior for the fluctuation of the average current obtained in the present paper will be observed in real experiments .",
    "in addition , we hope that our analytical treatments and results become a basis for further studies , especially for the connection with the non - equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "we thank n. a. sinitsyn for useful comments , and anonymous referees for many valuable information and suggestions .",
    "it is possible to divide the total phase @xmath49 in eq .   into two parts as follows : @xcite @xmath118 @xmath119 is called the dynamical phase , and @xmath120 is the aharonov - anandan phase .",
    "the dynamical phase is defined by @xcite @xmath121 where @xmath50 is a state vector of a cyclic evolved state , and @xmath122 is related to a evolved state associated with the periodic adjoint hamiltonian @xmath123 .",
