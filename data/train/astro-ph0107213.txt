    "the monitoring of galactic sources by the _ wide - field camera _ on bepposax and the _ all - sky monitor _ on the rossi x - ray timing explorer have detected large type i bursts ( hereafter referred to as `` superbursts '' ) from six accreting neutron stars ( cornelisse et al .",
    "2000 ; strohmayer 2000 ; heise et al .",
    "2000 ; wijnands 2001 ; kuulkers 2001 ) .",
    "these bursts share a number of characteristics ; burst energies @xmath7 ( roughly 1000 times larger than a normal type i burst ) ; durations of a few hours and accretion rates @xmath8 ( wijnands 2001 ) .",
    "the superburst recurrence time is not well known , though one recurrent burst has been seen 4.7 years later ( wijnands 2001 ) .",
    "the light curves are similar to a type i burst in spectral evolution , though the immediate decay timescale is about two hours ; 1000 times longer than a typical type i x - ray burst .",
    "the superbursts appear to be thermonuclear flashes from fuel at much larger depths than a typical type i burst .",
    "for example , if the nuclear energy release is 1 mev per accreted nucleon ( @xmath9 ) , the accumulated mass would be @xmath10 , implying a recurrence time of @xmath11 months for an accretion rate of @xmath12 , much longer than a typical type i burst .",
    "flashes from pure @xmath1layers have been discussed previously ( woosley & taam 1976 ; taam & picklum 1978 ; brown & bildsten 1998 ) and might well apply to the pure helium accretor 4u 1820 - 30 ( strohmayer 2000 ) . however , there are two difficulties with such a model for the superbursts from hydrogen / helium accretors : ( 1 ) the recurrence times are very long , and the burst energies correspondingly large , unless a large heat flux from the crust of the star is present deep in the ocean ; and , ( 2 ) our current understanding of the ashes from hydrogen / helium burning does not point to accumulation of pure @xmath1 . instead , schatz et al .",
    "( 1999 , 2001 ) have shown that only a small amount of @xmath1remains after all of the hydrogen and helium has burned via the rapid proton ( rp ) process ( wallace & woosley 1981 ) ; either from steady state burning or unstable type i x - ray bursting .",
    "even though a small fraction by mass ( typically @xmath13 ) , we show here that it is enough to trigger a thermonuclear runaway with energy comparable to the superbursts .",
    "most important , however , is the role played by the heavy ashes from the rp process .",
    "these reduce the thermal conductivity enough to force a large temperature gradient in the ocean .",
    "this ignites the @xmath1at much lower masses than previously expected and reduces the energy and recurrence times to levels consistent with the superbursts .",
    "in addition , the conductive cooling times from these flashes are consistent with the long decay times observed .",
    "we presume that the ashes of hydrogen / helium burning in the upper atmosphere primarily consist ( by mass ) of a single dominant nucleus of mass @xmath14 and charge @xmath15 and a small amount of @xmath1with mass fraction @xmath0 .",
    "schatz et al .  ( 2001 ) recently showed that the onset of a closed cycle ( called the snsbte cycle ) in the rp - process naturally stops the increasing @xmath16 trajectory once nuclei of mass @xmath17 are reached .",
    "though a range of nuclei are made , those with masses in this region dominate the mix . for simplicity",
    ", we take @xmath18as our fiducial nucleus ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) with mass fraction @xmath21 .    the energy released when @xmath1fuses ( for simplicity , we presume that the reaction makes @xmath22 ) is @xmath23 , so that if @xmath24 , an accumulated mass of @xmath25 is needed for a @xmath26 burst . at an accretion rate of @xmath27 onto a @xmath28 neutron star , the recurrence time would be @xmath29 years ( we define @xmath30 , the local eddington accretion rate for solar composition ) .",
    "the pressure at the base of such a pile is @xmath31 , where the surface gravity is @xmath32 . at such high pressures ,",
    "the equation of state is that of degenerate , relativistic electrons with fermi energy @xmath33 , where @xmath34 . supporting this pressure requires a density @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "though they exert little pressure , the nuclei set the thermal conductivity via electron - ion scattering . for a classical one component plasma with ion separation , @xmath37 , defined by @xmath38 , where @xmath39 , the importance of coulomb physics for the ions is measured by @xmath40 where @xmath41 . for this initial calculation",
    "we use the microphysics of the liquid state ; @xmath42 ( farouki & hamaguchi 1993 and references therein ) , even when , in some instances ( mostly when @xmath43 ) @xmath44 .",
    "electron conduction dominates the heat transport in the liquid ocean .",
    "the heat flux is given by @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the thermal conductivity ( see yakovlev & urpin 1980 ; itoh et al .",
    "1983 , potekhin et al .  1999 ) .",
    "for @xmath47 , we find @xmath48 where we assume the electrons are relativistic , and take the coulomb logarithm to be unity ( a good approximation in the deep ocean ; bildsten & cutler 1995 ) . integrating the heat equation and hydrostatic balance gives the temperature contrast required between two points ( at pressure @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) to transport a heat flux @xmath51 ( bildsten & cutler 1995 ; brown & bildsten 1998 ) @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the eddington flux for a @xmath54 , @xmath28 star .",
    "the flux in the ocean is the sum of compressional heating and heat flowing out from the crust , deposited there by electron captures and pycnonuclear reactions ( haensel & zdunik 1990 ; brown 2000 ) .",
    "since both contributions are proportional to the local accretion rate per unit area , we write @xmath55 , with @xmath56 . equation ( [ eq : trel ] ) then gives @xmath57 in a careful study of the overall thermal balance of the neutron star , brown ( 2000 ) found @xmath58 for accretion rates @xmath59 ( i.e. , of the @xmath60 per nucleon deposited in the crust , @xmath29% escapes through the surface ; the rest is emitted as neutrinos from the inner crust and core ) .",
    "the compressional heating term contributes @xmath61 per nucleon , small compared to the heat flux from the crust .    for @xmath62 , the second term in equation ( [ eq : trel2 ] )",
    "is close to unity for a pure @xmath1ocean ( @xmath63 ) , but @xmath64 times larger for a @xmath18ocean ( @xmath65 ) ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "thus , an ocean of heavy ashes is hotter than that of pure @xmath1at the same depth .",
    "this is critical , as it allows for ignition at lower column densities , @xmath67 .",
    "figure [ fig : settle ] shows the temperature as a function of column depth for a pure @xmath1ocean , and for a @xmath1@xmath18mixture with @xmath1mass fraction @xmath68 . in each case",
    ", we take @xmath69 , and show two accretion rates , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",
    "the dashed line is the crystallization condition for @xmath18 .",
    "the lower thermal conductivity makes the @xmath1@xmath18oceans much hotter than the pure @xmath1oceans .",
    "we terminate the thermal profiles in figure [ fig : settle ] at the depth at which the @xmath1ignites .",
    "brown & bildsten ( 1998 ) showed that the condition for an unstable @xmath1ignition in a neutron star ocean is set by competition with conductive cooling , so that a thermal runaway occurs when the local nuclear burning energy release , @xmath72 , satisfies @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is an approximation of the cooling rate ( e.g. , fujimoto , hanawa , & miyaji 1981 ) and the nuclear reaction rates are as described in brown & bildsten ( 1998 ) .",
    "for the thermal conductivity given by equation ( [ eq : cond ] ) , @xmath75 , unstable ignition requires @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the temperature sensitivity of the fusion reaction .",
    "ignition curves are shown in figure [ fig : settle ] for two cases .",
    "the lower dotted line is for a pure @xmath1ocean and matches that in brown & bildsten ( 1998 ) .",
    "the upper dotted line shows the ignition curve for a @xmath1@xmath18mixture with @xmath68 . because of the lower abundance",
    ", a larger column density is needed to ignite @xmath1 in a @xmath18ocean for a given temperature",
    ". however , ignition occurs at smaller column depths in this case , because the @xmath1@xmath18ocean is hotter .    for the pure @xmath1models of figure [",
    "fig : settle ] , ignition occurs at @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) for @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) . writing the burst energy @xmath82 , or @xmath83 , and recurrence time @xmath84",
    ", we find that pure @xmath1ignitions have recurrence times @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) and burst energies @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "these burst energies exceed the energy of the superbursts by at least a factor of ten . for the @xmath1@xmath18models",
    ", ignition occurs at @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) for @xmath71 ( @xmath70 ) , with recurrence time @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) , and burst energy @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "not only must the thermal settling solution reach the ignition curve , but the @xmath1must also have survived to that depth .",
    "thus , in order to obtain a flash , the @xmath1lifetime to the fusion reaction , @xmath95 must exceed the accumulation time , @xmath96 , at the ignition point . combining this condition with equation ( [ eq : ignite ] )",
    "implies that @xmath97 must exceed the critical value @xmath98 when we evaluate this using @xmath46 and the @xmath99 , @xmath100 relations for degenerate relativistic electrons , the density cancels out , giving @xmath101 this relation is robust and shows that large accretion rates are required for unstable @xmath1ignition . in order to eliminate the temperature",
    ", we neglect the outer temperature in equation ( [ eq : trel2 ] ) and substitute for the temperature at the base in equation ( [ eq : mdotc ] ) .",
    "we then find that the explicit accretion rate dependences cancel and the requirement for an instability is just @xmath102 at smaller @xmath0 , the @xmath1depletes and burns steadily before reaching ignition .",
    "figure [ fig : mdotx ] shows the @xmath1mass fraction required to achieve an explosion as a function of @xmath97 and @xmath103 .",
    "the accretion rate dependence is mostly from the ignition pressure dependence on @xmath97 .",
    "the top two panels in figure [ fig : gom ] show the burst energies and recurrence times for unstable models .",
    "the curves are for @xmath68 and ( top to bottom ) , @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "having derived the conditions for an unstable ignition of a small mass fraction of @xmath1 , we now calculate the time dependent nature of the flash and estimate the time it takes for the energy to escape from the burning layer .",
    "the `` one - zone '' version of the time dependent heat equation is @xmath106 in which we write the specific heat at constant volume @xmath107 rather than constant pressure ( an excellent approximation since @xmath108 throughout the flash ) . in the case of predominantly high @xmath109 nuclei ,",
    "the electron specific heat dominates that of the ions , so @xmath110 .",
    "once ignited , the @xmath1burning is extremely rapid and there is no time for cooling to occur while the @xmath1burns .",
    "the fluid then evolves to a final temperature set by the total energy released @xmath111 .",
    "using @xmath107 for the electrons and taking @xmath112 gives @xmath113 thus , @xmath114 is adequate to substantially change the temperature from that at ignition and trigger a thermal instability .",
    "if @xmath115 , the peak temperatures would exceed @xmath116 and neutrino cooling would reduce the observed energetics of the event .",
    "after all the @xmath1has burned and the fluid has reached @xmath117 , the layer cools . integrating equation ( [ eq : dtdt ] ) starting from @xmath117 with only the @xmath118 term , we find @xmath119 , where @xmath120 depends only on the depth in the star and the composition , and is temperature independent .",
    "the luminosity during the conductive cooling phase is thus set by the temperature at the base of the layer ; @xmath121 .",
    "thus , the observer should see a timescale of luminosity decay equal to equation ( [ eq : tcool ] ) , as shown in figure [ fig : gom ] .",
    "if we use @xmath117 from equation ( [ eq : tfinal ] ) for an upper limit , we find the maximum conductive cooling luminosity @xmath122 due to our neglect of convective heat transport , this @xmath123 will be less than the peak luminosity of the burst .",
    "however , since convection can not last much longer than the burning time , we expect something similar to this simple luminosity evolution to occur during the burst decay , over times relevant to detection by flux monitoring on hourly timescales .",
    "detection of these flashes should be easiest at low @xmath2 s , as @xmath123 increases due to ignition at higher densities , whereas the accretion luminosity , @xmath124 , is dropping .",
    "hence , the contrast of the burst cooling tail is largest for low @xmath2 sources , as shown in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : gom ] .",
    "detecting one of these flares from a rapidly accreting @xmath109 source would require flux sensitivity at the @xmath125 level on a timescale of a few hours and spectral sensitivity to distinguish that the flux rise is from extra thermal emission .",
    "since these bursts will occur roughly once a month , it is an archival project to find the rare event in the accumulated observations .",
    "we have shown that the ignition of a small mass fraction of @xmath1 in a neutron star ocean consisting mostly of heavier elements is thermally unstable and leads to flashes whose energy , recurrence times and durations are similar to the superbursts .",
    "the energy from these flashes takes a long time to escape the star , possibly explaining the persistent `` offset '' in the flux nearly a day after the superburst in 4u 1735 - 44 ( see figure 1 of cornellise et al .",
    "we also predict flashes at high local accretion rates which include the z sources and accreting x - ray pulsars . in the pulsar case , some of the difficulties associated with explaining flares from lmc x-4 via pure @xmath1burning ( see brown & bildsten 1998 )",
    "might well be alleviated in the mixed case we present here .",
    "cornellise et al .",
    "( 2000 ) reported an absence of regular type i bursts for seven days after the superburst .",
    "this might be due to thermal stabilization of the hydrogen / helium burning layers by the large heat flux from the cooling ashes of the @xmath1burning .",
    "paczynski ( 1983 ) and bildsten ( 1995 ) have shown that luminosities in excess of the helium burning flux ( or @xmath126 ) will stabilize the burning , as then the thermal state of the burning layer is independent of the local burning rates .",
    "this appears most likely at low accretion rates , where the conductive cooling is slowest , thus halting type i bursts for @xmath127 days after the superburst .",
    "there is still much to be done , including a time dependent study of the onset of the instability .",
    "our initial integrations of the time - dependent code from bildsten ( 1995 ) demonstrate a transition from steady - state burning at low @xmath97 to unstable flashes at higher rates . in future work , this code will be used to more accurately calculate the transition accretion rate , @xmath128 with realistic mixes of @xmath1and rp - process ashes .",
    "only then can we make the comparisons to observations that will allow us to constrain the rp - process ashes .",
    "we thank erik kuulkers and marten van kerkwijk for conversations about the properties of the superbursts and hendrik schatz for insights on the rp - process .",
    "we also thank deepto chakrabarty and bob rutledge for comments on the manuscript .",
