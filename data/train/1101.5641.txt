    "graph pebbling is like a number of network models , including network flow , transportation , and supply chain , in that one must move some commodity from a set of sources to a set of sinks optimally according to certain constraints .",
    "network flow constraints restrict flow along edges and conserve flow through vertices , and the goal is to maximize the amount of commodity reaching the sinks .",
    "the transportation model includes per unit costs along edges and aims to minimize the total cost of shipments that satisfy the source supplies and sink demands . at its simplest , the supply chain model ignores transportation costs while seeking to satisfy demands with minimum inventory .",
    "the graph pebbling model introduced by chung @xcite also tries to meet demands with minimum inventory , but constrains movement across an edge by the loss of the commodity itself , much like an oil tanker using up the fuel it transports , not unlike heat or other energy dissipating during transfer .",
    "specifically , a _ configuration _",
    "@xmath4 of pebbles on the vertices of a connected graph @xmath5 is a function @xmath6 ( the nonnegative integers ) , so that @xmath7 counts the number of pebbles placed on the vertex @xmath8 .",
    "we write @xmath9 for the _ size _ @xmath10 of @xmath4 ; i.e. the number of pebbles in the configuration . a _ pebbling step",
    "_ from a vertex @xmath11 to one of its neighbors @xmath8 reduces @xmath12 by two and increases @xmath7 by one ( so that one can think of it as moving one pebble at the _ cost _ of another as toll ) .",
    "given two configurations @xmath4 and @xmath13 we say that @xmath4 is @xmath13-_solvable _ if some sequence of pebbling steps converts @xmath4 to @xmath13 .",
    "in this paper we study the traditional case in which the target distribution consists of a single pebble at some _ root _",
    "vertex @xmath14 ( one can peruse @xcite for a wide array of variations on this theme ) .",
    "we are concerned with determining @xmath15 , the minimum number @xmath0 of pebbles so that every configuration of size @xmath0 is @xmath14-solvable .",
    "then the _ pebbling number _ of @xmath5 equals @xmath16 .",
    "alternatively , @xmath17 is one more than the maximum @xmath18 such that there is some root @xmath14 and some size @xmath18 configuration @xmath4 so that @xmath4 does not solve @xmath14 .",
    "the primary focus of this paper is to exploit this duality with newly discovered algebraic constraints .      given a graph @xmath5 , configuration @xmath4 , and root @xmath14 , one can ask how difficult it is to determine if @xmath4 solves @xmath14 . in @xcite",
    "it was determined that this problem is -hard .",
    "subsequently , @xcite proved that the problem is -complete , with @xcite showing further that answering the question `` is @xmath19 ? '' is @xmath2-complete ( and hence both -hard and co - hard , and therefore in neither  nor co  unless  @xmath20 co ) .",
    "finding classes of graphs on which we can answer more quickly is therefore relevent , and there is some evidence that one can be successful in this direction . besides what we share in this introduction , we show later that many graphs can have very short certificates that @xmath19 .    the @xmath14-unsolvable configuration with one pebble on every vertex other than the root @xmath14 shows that @xmath21 , where @xmath22 denotes the number of vertices of @xmath5 . in @xcite",
    "it is proved that graphs of diameter two satisfy @xmath23 , with a characterization separating the two classes ( _ class 0 _ means @xmath24 and _ class 1 _ means @xmath25 ) given in @xcite .",
    "one of the consequences of this is that 3-connected diameter two graphs are class 0 . as an extension",
    "it is proved in @xcite that @xmath26-connected diameter @xmath27 graphs are also class 0 , and they use this result to show that almost every graph with significantly more than @xmath28 ( for any fixed @xmath27 ) edges is class 0 .",
    "consequently , it is a very ( asymptotically ) small collection of graphs that cause all the problems .    knowing the pebbling number of a graph and actually solving a particular configuration",
    "are two different things , as even a configuration that is known to be solvable ( say , one of size equal to the pebbling number ) can be difficult to solve . evidence that most configurations are not so difficult , though , comes in the following form .",
    "the work of @xcite shows that every infinite graph sequence @xmath29 has a _ pebbling threshold _",
    "@xmath30 , which yields the property that almost every configuration @xmath31 on @xmath32 of size @xmath33 is solvable ( and almost every configuration of size @xmath34 is not ) . in papers such as @xcite",
    "we find that @xmath35 is significantly smaller than @xmath36  for example , @xmath37 as opposed to @xmath38 for the complete graph @xmath39 , and roughly @xmath40 as opposed to @xmath41 for the path @xmath42 .",
    "moreover , the proof techniques reveal that almost all of these solvable configurations can be solved _",
    "greedily _ , meaning that every pebbling step reduces the distance of the pebble to the root .",
    "so the hardness of the problem stems from a rare collection of configurations .    with these results as backdrop",
    ", @xcite presents a polynomial algorithm for determining the solvability of a configuration on diameter two graphs of connectivity some fixed @xmath43 .",
    "furthermore , @xcite contains an algorithm that calculates pebbling numbers , and is able to complete the task for every graph on at most 9 vertices . also , the proof in @xcite that the @xmath27-dimensional cube is of class 0 is a polynomial algorithm ( actually bounded by its number of edges @xmath44 ) . along these lines ,",
    "our main objective is to develop algorithmic tools that will in a reasonable amount of time yield good upper bounds on @xmath17 for much larger graphs , and in particular decide in some cases whether or not a graph is of class 0 .",
    "this latter determination is motivated most by the following conjecture of graham in @xcite . for graphs @xmath5 and @xmath45 , let @xmath46 denote the _ cartesian product _ whose vertices are @xmath47 , with edges @xmath48 whenever @xmath49 in @xmath5 and @xmath50 whenever @xmath51 in @xmath45 .",
    "[ graham ] * ( graham ) * every pair of graphs @xmath5 and @xmath45 satisfy @xmath52 .    the conjecture has been verified for many graphs ; see @xcite for the most recent work .",
    "however , as noted in @xcite , there is good reason to suspect that @xmath53 might be a counterexample to this conjecture , if one exists , where @xmath54 is the _ lemke _",
    "graph of figure [ lemke ] .",
    "since @xmath54 is class 0 , graham s conjecture requires that @xmath53 is also , but it is a formiddable challenge to compute the pebbling number of a graph on 64 vertices .",
    "one hopes that graph structure and symmetry will be of use , but purely graphical methods have failed to date .",
    "the methods of this paper represent the first strides toward the computational resolution of the @xmath55 question , `` is @xmath56 ? '' .",
    "certainly , these methods alone will not suffice in theorem [ lem2 ]  in fact , for one root @xmath14 we show @xmath57 .",
    "] , but if they produce a decent upper bound then the methods of @xcite might be able to finish the job .",
    "the main tool we develop is the weight function lemma [ wfl ] .",
    "this lemma allows us to define a ( very large ) integer linear optimization problem that yields an upper bound on the pebbling number .",
    "this has several important consequences , including the following .    1 .",
    "the pebbling numbers of reasonably small graphs often can be computed easily .",
    "moreover , it is frequently the case that the fractional relaxation suffices for the task , allowing the computation for somewhat larger graphs . 2 .",
    "it is also common that only a small portion of the constraints are required , expanding the pool of computable graphs even more . , with graphs on @xmath58 and @xmath59 vertices .",
    "] one can restrict the types of constraints to greedy , bounded depth , and so on , with great success , seemingly because of the comments above .",
    "potentially , this allows one to begin to catalog special classes of graphs such as class 0 , ( semi-)greedy , and tree - solvable .",
    "the dual solutions often yield very short certificates of the results , in most cases quadratic in the number of vertices , and usually at most the number of vertices times the degree of the root .",
    "these certificates are remarkably simple compared to the usual solvability arguments that chase pebbles all over the graph in a barrage of cases .",
    "one can sometimes find such certificates for infinite families of graphs by hand , without resorting to machine for more than the smallest one or two of its members .",
    "this was our approach in section [ classes ] , for example .",
    "our method gives trivial proofs of 1 .",
    "@xmath60 and @xmath61 , which we write as @xmath62 , and 2 .",
    "@xmath63 is class 0 for @xmath64 , where @xmath65 denotes the @xmath66 _ graph power _ of @xmath5 ( as opposed to the _ cartesian _ power @xmath67 ) .",
    "this answers a question of @xcite , who defined the _ pebbling exponent _ of @xmath5 minimum such @xmath68 for which @xmath69 .",
    "thus @xmath70 ( see theorem [ pebbexpo ] ) , which is fairly close to the obvious lower bound of @xmath71 .    in this paper",
    "we apply the weight function lemma to several specific graphs , including the petersen , lemke , @xmath3 weak bruhat , lemke squared , and two random graphs , as well as to a number of infinite families of graphs , such as trees , cycles , graph powers of cycles , cubes , and some generalized petersen and coxeter graphs .",
    "let @xmath72 be the path @xmath73 on @xmath74 vertices .",
    "then @xmath75 is easily proved by induction . in particular , any configuration of at least @xmath76 pebbles",
    "solves @xmath77 .",
    "but one can say more about smaller @xmath77-solvable configurations as well , with the use of a weight function @xmath78 .",
    "define @xmath78 on @xmath79 by @xmath80 , and extend the weight function to configurations by @xmath81 .",
    "then a pebbling step can only preserve or decrease the weight of a configuration . since the weight of a configuration with a pebble on @xmath77 is at least @xmath76 , we see that @xmath76 is a lower bound on every @xmath77-solvable configuration .",
    "in fact , induction shows that every @xmath77-unsolvable configuration has weight at most @xmath82 , which equals @xmath83 .",
    "that is , this inequality characterizes @xmath77-unsolvable configurations on @xmath72 .",
    "the weight function lemma [ wfl ] generalizes this result on trees , and we explore the applications of the lemma in the following sections .",

    "the weight function lemma allows one to consider all subtrees rooted at @xmath14 ( not only spanning trees ) simultaneously , which we will see is significantly more powerful .",
    "one strength of the method is that the relaxation frequently has an integer optimum .",
    "this means that the dual solution will point out which tree constraints certify the result , and because the dual problem has only @xmath123 constraints there are at most that many such trees in the certificate .",
    "experience has shown , however , that usually one can find a certificate with only @xmath124 trees ( or sometimes a few extra ) .",
    "we will see this behavior starting in section [ genapps ] .",
    "we begin with the pebbling number of trees , whose formula was first discovered and proved in @xcite .",
    "view a tree @xmath84 with root @xmath14 as a directed graph with every edge directed toward @xmath14 .",

    "we can use corollary [ upper ] to give a new proof of the following result of @xcite .",
    "[ tree ] for a tree @xmath84 and root @xmath14 we have @xmath126 , where @xmath127 denotes the length ( number of edges ) of @xmath99 .",
    "we begin by showing that a maximum size @xmath14-unsolvable configuration has pebbles on leaves only , and in fact on all leaves . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath4 has a pebble on the nonleaf @xmath101 , then we define a _ pushback _ of @xmath4 at @xmath101 to be any configuration obtained by removing the @xmath128 pebbles from @xmath101 , adding @xmath129 pebbles to one of the children of @xmath101 , and adding @xmath130 pebble to all other children of @xmath101 .",
    "certainly , if @xmath4 is @xmath14-unsolvable and has no pebbles past @xmath101 ( on the subtree of @xmath84 rooted at @xmath101 , minus @xmath101 itself ) , then the pushback will also be @xmath14-unsolvable , and thus satisfy the constraints of @xmath131 .",
    "it will also be larger than @xmath4 .",
    "the configuration @xmath132 that places @xmath133 pebbles on the leaf of the path @xmath134 is one possible result of pushing back the empty configuration , and so satisfies the constraints of @xmath131 .",
    "hence @xmath135 .    for the upper bound we prove that @xmath132 is optimal by using induction to show that the optimal configuration has @xmath133 pebbles on the leaf @xmath136 of @xmath99 for every @xmath134 .",
    "this is true if @xmath137 , so suppose @xmath138 and let @xmath139 denote one of the paths in @xmath125 whose leaf has the highest weight in @xmath78 , with a tie going to one of the shortest length .",
    "this is to guarantee that the graph @xmath140 , where @xmath101 is the root of @xmath139 , is a tree ( i.e. is connected ) . in order to maximize the number of pebbles that satisfy @xmath141 we would transfer as many pebbles from @xmath142 to other leaves as possible because their weights are at most @xmath143 and we could add extra pebbles when the weight is smaller .",
    "but by induction on @xmath140 we know from the constraint @xmath144 that each @xmath145 , with equality for all @xmath146 if and only if @xmath4 is maximum . therefore , since @xmath147 for all @xmath134 , we have @xmath148 which implies that @xmath149 .",
    "a slight weakness of these tree constraints is that they do not classify unsolvable configurations on trees the way that they do on paths .",
    "this is because they let in a few solvable configurations .",
    "for example , consider the star on four vertices with one of its leaves as root @xmath14 .",
    "then the configuration with @xmath150 pebbles on each of the other two leaves is @xmath14-solvable and satisfies all tree contraints .",
    "since it is the average of the two @xmath14-unsolvable configurations that place either @xmath130 and @xmath151 or @xmath151 and @xmath130 on those other leaves , it can not be cut out by the tree constraints that do nt cut out at least one of these two other constraints . in this case",
    "it does nt hurt us , since the strategy bound yields @xmath152 and the actual pebbling number is 5 , but it can cause trouble on graphs in general . for example , we know that the 3-cube @xmath153 in figure [ 3cube ] has pebbling number 8 , so that the shown configuration @xmath4 is solvable ( pebbles from to top must be split in two directions in its solution ) .",
    "however , no strategy recognizes its solution , and corollary [ upper ] yields only @xmath154 ( the three rotations of the strategy in the center in figure [ 3cube ] certify this ) .",
    "one can see where the aforementioned star appears in the figure [ 3cube ] configuration on @xmath153 and is exploited accordingly : moving pebbles from the @xmath155 along one edge yields a @xmath156 configuration , while splitting the moves along two edges yields a @xmath157 configuration .    ; a simplified nonbasic strategy ( right ) that does the same , title=\"fig:\",height=216 ] @xmath158 ; a simplified nonbasic strategy ( right ) that does the same , title=\"fig:\",height=216 ] @xmath158 ; a simplified nonbasic strategy ( right ) that does the same , title=\"fig:\",height=216 ]",
    "in this section we illustrate the method more fully by presenting short proofs of both known and new results .",
    "we begin by relaxing strategies in the following way .",
    "we now use the term _ basic _ to describe the strategies as currently defined .",
    "a _ nonbasic strategy _ will satisfy the inequality @xmath159 in place of the equality used in a basic strategy ( see figure [ 3cube ] ) .",
    "the following lemma shows that we can use nonbasic strategies in an upper bound certificate since they are conic combinations of a nested family of basic strategies .",
    "thus the use of nonbasic strategies can simplify and shorten certificates significantly .",

    "in this paper we have shown several different strengths of the weight function lemma in combination with linear optimization , highlighting its versatility .",
    "it has been used to compute upper bounds on and exact values of the pebbling number of small graphs .",
    "it has also been successful in calculating the pebbling numbers of much larger graphs than previous algorithms . for such graphs having too many strategies than time",
    "allows to construct , the technique of creating a smaller set of them at random seems to perform just as well .",
    "this is most likely due to the property that nonoptimal solutions ( derived from having fewer constraints ) seem , in most instances , to be near optimal ( have the same floor function ) .",
    "in fact , by restricting strategies to be breadth - first search , one obtains upper bounds on the greedy pebbling numbers of graphs ( which requires pebbling steps to move toward the root ) .",
    "the method also yields results for many families of graphs , in many cases by hand , with much simpler and remarkably shorter proofs than given in previously existing arguments .",
    "this is especially so with highly symmetric graphs .",
    "we note also that the technique can be used in conjunction with more traditional arguments , as in theorem [ r15class0 ] , and it has delivered an array of upper bounds , such as @xmath74 , @xmath572 , and @xmath573 , most of which are the best known and might possibly be best possible .",
    "it s two main shortcomings are the inability to overcome the kind of splitting structure found in cubes , for example , in which solutions to some configurations require nontree solutions , and the difficulty in dealing with large diameter , although success has been found with cycles and their graph powers , in addition to petersen and coxeter generalizations .",
    "when the technique gives upper bounds , it would be of great use to know how good the bound might be .",
    "that is , does the weight function lemma yield an approximation algorithm for graph pebbling ?",
    "[ approxalgo ] is there a constant @xmath165 such that , for all graphs @xmath5 and every root @xmath574 , @xmath575 ?",
    "for example , is @xmath576 ?",
    "the cube @xmath577 shows that it could nt be any smaller .",
    "[ qapprox ] for all @xmath578 and all @xmath579 we have @xmath580 .",
    "we exploit the symmetry of @xmath577 as follows . because @xmath577 is vertex transitive we need only consider one root @xmath14 .",
    "we identify @xmath581 with the power set of @xmath582 and take @xmath583 .",
    "we define a single strategy @xmath90 for @xmath14 and then apply every permutation of @xmath582 to obtain other strategies .",
    "finally we average over this collection of strategies .",
    "the result will be that @xmath584 will be at most one more than the sum of the weights in this average .    for each @xmath585 such that @xmath586 we define @xmath587 and @xmath588 .",
    "we form @xmath90 by first taking a neighbor of @xmath14 .",
    "this neighbor will be a set of size 1 , to which we assign the weight @xmath589  this is step @xmath590 , with @xmath591 . for future steps",
    "@xmath310 , while @xmath592 , we continue adding a single neighbor , a set of size @xmath310 , to the current leaf of @xmath90 , and assign the weight @xmath545 . if @xmath586 , however , we add @xmath593 vertices to the current leaves : @xmath594 of these will have weight @xmath545 and one will have weight @xmath595 . all of these will be connected to leaves of weight @xmath485 and none will be connected to leaves of weight @xmath596 .",
    "this is possible because the degree of each vertex of size @xmath597 is @xmath301 , and @xmath598 whenever @xmath599 , so there are enough potential neighbors to accomplish this .",
    "hence we obtain weight @xmath130 on average for vertices of size @xmath310 for which @xmath586 , and weight @xmath600 otherwise .",
    "this yields the bound @xmath601 .",
    "if one restricts their attention to only polynomially many strategies , this linear optimization technique becomes a polynomial algrorithm .",
    "it would be useful to investigate how good the approximation can be under these circumstances .",
