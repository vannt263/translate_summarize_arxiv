    "in this paper we consider a pair of boson creation @xmath0 and annihilation @xmath1 operators satisfying the commutation relation @xmath4=1.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these operators play a fundamental role in the formalism of second quantization in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory ( qft ) @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "since the creation and annihilation operators do not commute serious problems with their ordering arise",
    ". a very convenient and well defined form of the operators depending on @xmath1 and @xmath0 is the so called normally ordered form @xcite .",
    "an operator is said to be in a normally ordered form if all creation operators stand to the left of the annihilation operators . the most important application field of the normal order is the qft @xcite .",
    "for a recent study of the interplay of the qft , normal order and combinatorics see ref.@xcite .",
    "procedure of normal ordering of the operator , i.e. moving all the creation operators to the left with the use of relation eq.([hw ] ) , is in general a nontrivial task .",
    "a first example is ordering of the power of the number operator @xcite@xcite : @xmath5 where @xmath6 are the stirling numbers of the second kind @xcite enumerating partitions of the set of @xmath7 elements into @xmath8 nonempty subsets , and satisfying the following recurrence relation @xmath9 with initial values @xmath10 .",
    "+ as the extension of this result we have considered operators in the form @xmath11 ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 -positive integers , @xmath14 ) , for which a normally ordered form is given by @xmath15^n=(a^\\dag)^{n(r - s)}\\sum_{k = s}^{ns } s_{r , s}(n , k ) ( a^\\dag)^ka^k,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 are generalized stirling numbers @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "this kind of formulas allow one to write the exponentials @xmath17 in the normally ordered form and then easily calculate the coherent state expectation values which are of importance e.g. in quantum optics @xcite .",
    "the clue of these calculations is the knowledge of the properties of the numbers @xmath16 .",
    "as they are of a combinatorial origin , the recurrence relations , dobiski - type formulas , closed - form expresions and generating functions were extensively studied @xcite .",
    "+ in the following we further extend these results to normal ordering of a general _ boson string _ in the form @xmath18 , by establishing a link to special structures in enumerative combinatorics .",
    "this in turn gives us the rigorous demonstration of the properties of the generalized stirling and bell numbers arising in this problem .",
    "the construction of the graphs ( the so called bugs ) associated with these numbers provides a graphical interpretation of the normal ordering procedure .",
    "in this section we define the generalization of ordinary bell and stirling numbers which arise in the solution of the normal ordering problem for a boson string . given two sequences of positive integers @xmath19 and @xmath20 we let @xmath21 be the positive integers appearing in the expansion @xmath22 where @xmath23 , which we assume here to be non - negative .",
    "we observe that the whole theory can be carried through for @xmath24 negative , at the cost of minor adaptations , which however do not change the numbers involved .",
    "note that the r.h.s . of eq.([s ] ) is already normally ordered .",
    "+ we call @xmath21 the generalized stirling numbers of the second kind .",
    "the generalized bell number is defined as the sum @xmath25 in this notation the generalized stirling numbers defined in eq.([srs ] ) correspond to a _ uniform _ case @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "+ we introduce the notation @xmath28 and @xmath29 and state the recurrence relation satisfied by generalized stirling numbers @xmath30 @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the falling factorial . one can give the derivation of eq.([rec ] ) by induction using the following consequence of eq.([hw ] ) ( see the proof in @xcite ) : @xmath33 the full details of this approach can be consulted in @xcite .",
    "+ observe that the problem stated above can also be formulated in terms of the multiplication @xmath34 and derivative @xmath35 operators as they satisfy @xmath36=1 $ ] .",
    "the representation of boson commutation relation with the @xmath35 and @xmath34 operators resembles the bargmann representation @xcite , used in connection with coherent states .",
    "( here we do not enter into that framework , with all the intricacies of the scalar product , hermiticity etc .",
    ", as in our context only the algebraic properties matter . ) then eq.([s ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath37 acting with both sides of eq.([dx ] ) on the exponential function @xmath38 we get the identity @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the so called generalized bell polynomial .",
    "observe that the order of the so defined generalized bell polynomial does not depend on @xmath41 .",
    "eq.([defbell ] ) gives the formula @xmath42 using the well known commutation rule ( equivalent to the leibniz rule ) @xmath43 we get the recursive formula @xmath44 by taking coefficients of @xmath45 on both sides of eq.([rec1 ] ) we obtain the recurrence relation for the generalized stirling numbers of eq.([rec ] ) .",

    "of eq.([dx ] ) on @xmath46 may be calculated explicitly . to this end one",
    "first evaluates it on the monomial @xmath47 yielding @xmath48x^{n+d_n}$ ] which in turn easily gives the result of the action on the exponential function @xmath38 . with this observation , together with eq.([defbell ] ) we arrive at the extended dobiski - type relation for generalized bell polynomials @xmath49\\frac{x^m}{m!},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which by cauchy s multiplication of series yields the expression for @xmath21 : @xmath50 an alternative , very similar demonstration of the above results can be carried through with the use of coherent states .",
    "these are defined for complex @xmath51 , as @xmath52 , where @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath56 s are called the number states .",
    "the coherent state matrix element of eq.([s ] ) establishes a link to generalized bell polynomials of eq.([bellpol ] ) : @xmath57 which after some algebra , provides an equivalent derivation of eqs.([dob ] ) and ( [ s ] ) .",
    "the first instance where the relation between the coherent state matrix elements and the bell polynomials appears is ref.@xcite , again for the generic case of eq.([aa ] ) , for which conventional bell polynomials are obtained .",
    "+ we shall proceed now to give a combinatorial interpretation of the above results .",
    "the essence of subsequent paragraphs will be a graph - theoretical description of the problem .",
    "we define the structures ( graphs ) that are counted by the generalized bell and stirling numbers and then give a thorough combinatorial derivation of the recurrence relations , dobiski - type formulas and other closed - form expressions .",
    "the eqs.([rec ] ) , ( [ dob ] ) and ( [ s ] ) will emerge from purely combinatorial considerations and this will permit the bijective identification of algebraic and combinatorial structures .",
