    "new experimental methods in the physics of macromolecules @xcite have been used to study and manipulate single molecules and their interactions .",
    "these methods make a contribution to our understanding of such phenomena as protein folding or unzipping dna ; one can push or pull a single molecule and watch how it responds .",
    "it is possible to apply ( and measure ) forces large enough to induce structural deformation of single molecules .",
    "one can monitor the mechanism of some force - driven phase transition occurring at the level of a single molecule .",
    "theoretical understanding of this behaviour has attracted much attention @xcite .",
    "new features are observed if one pulls a macromolecule localised near an adsorbing surface @xcite .",
    "one observes two phases : an adsorbed phase and a desorbed phase .",
    "the desorbed phase is characterised by the mean fraction of molecules in the adsorbing plane going to zero as the number of molecules in the chain goes to infinity . for",
    "a given temperature one can find the critical force at which the macromolecules are desorbed .",
    "the phase - diagram in the force - temperature plane can show re - entrant behaviour similar to that found in dna unzipping models @xcite and directed walk models @xcite .",
    "lattice models play an important role in the study of equilibrium properties of linear polymer molecules . including interactions between monomers and a surface confining the polymer , it is possible to investigate phenomena such as the adsorption - desorption transition .",
    "the pulling of directed polymers is already well investigated and understood @xcite .",
    "we use self - avoiding walks ( saw ) on a regular lattice to study the adsorption of a polymer at a surface subject to an elongation force .",
    "vrbova and whittington studied the phase diagram for adsorbing interacting self - avoiding walks using rigorous arguments @xcite and simulations with the markov chain method employing pivot steps @xcite .",
    "the transition studied by them for polymers in a good solvent ( without interaction between monomers ) is equivalent to temperature - driven adsorption ( without force ) in our saw - model .",
    "the model of saw for force - induced desorption was already investigated by mishra _ et.al .",
    "_ @xcite using exact enumeration , which gave the correct phase diagram but due the rather small system sizes studied , the location of the phase boundary for infinite systems was not very precise . in this paper",
    "we present an investigation of this problem using a new flatperm algorithm @xcite .",
    "this is a very good tool to easily get information of the whole phase diagram by calculating the complete density of states .",
    "while the exact enumeration study @xcite was restricted to @xmath1 steps , flatperm allowed us to perform `` approximate '' enumeration up to @xmath2 steps .",

    "monomers interacting with the surface ( in two dimensions this is a line ) are denoted by diamonds .",
    "the first vertex , which is fixed to the surface , is denoted by a white - filled diamond .",
    "the elongation force acts only at the last monomer pulling it in the perpendicular direction to the surface . ]",
    "we consider a self - avoiding walk on the simple cubic and square lattices confined to the half - space or half - plane , @xmath3 or @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "we define a _ visit _ as a vertex , representing a monomer , lying in the surface @xmath5 in three dimensions or on the line @xmath6 in two dimensions .",
    "the monomers interact with the surface via an interaction strength , @xmath7 .",
    "in addition we have an elongation force @xmath8 acting on the last monomer , pulling it away from the surface , i.e.  in the positive @xmath9-direction or positive @xmath10-direction , in three and two dimensions respectively ; see fig.[conf_ex ] .",
    "therefore we have two competing effects : attraction to the surface leading to adsorption and the elongation force leading to desorption .",
    "the partition function of the model is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the number of all configurations with @xmath13 vertices ( monomers ) with one end at some fixed origin at the surface @xmath5 or line @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the number of visits ( including the fixed site ) is denoted by @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the distance of the ( @xmath13)st vertex from the surface .",
    "the boltzmann weight @xmath16 ( @xmath7 ) is associated with the interaction with the surface and @xmath17 with the elongation force @xmath8 , where @xmath18 .",
    "we define a finite - size free energy @xmath19 per step as @xmath20 the usual free energy is related to this by @xmath21 . in our simulation",
    "we obtain estimates of @xmath12 , so that a quantity @xmath22 averaged over the set of parameters @xmath23 for a given length @xmath24 is calculated by @xmath25 in this paper we concentrate on the adsorption and elongation of the self - avoiding walk and the corresponding phase diagram .",
    "we investigate the behaviour of the average distance of the last monomer from the adsorbing surface @xmath26 the average numbers of monomers interacting with the surface @xmath27 and the fluctuations of @xmath14 @xmath28    since the desorption transition is characterised by a significant change in the number of surface adsorbed sites , we also investigate the fluctuations of @xmath14 as a signature of the transition .",
    "we are interested in determining the location of the adsorption transition for the whole range of forces and temperatures .",
    "since we are interested in investigating the complete phase diagram , one needs to perform simulations for the whole range of temperatures and forces .",
    "conventionally , one would carry out different simulations for numerous values of temperature and force to investigate the region of interest . with the flatperm algorithm it is possible to cover the whole range ( given sufficient time for the simulation to converge ) with one single simulation .",
    "the flatperm algorithm is a recently proposed stochastic growth algorithm @xcite , which performs an estimation of the whole density of states and can be interpreted as an approximate counting algorithm .",
    "the algorithm combines the pruned - enriched rosenbluth method ( perm ) @xcite with umbrella sampling techniques @xcite .",
    "the configurations of interest are grown from scratch adding a new monomer at each step .",
    "we parameterise the configuration space in such a manner that the algorithm explores it evenly ; i.e.  for every set of parameters @xmath29 it aims to generate the same number of samples .",
    "this requirement leads to a flat histogram in the parameterisation . here",
    "we choose as parameters the surface energy ( number of contacts , @xmath14 ) and the distance of the last monomer from the adsorbing surface , @xmath15 . during one simulation",
    "we are able to explore all possible sets of parameters ( all vectors ( @xmath30 ) for all @xmath31 ) and estimate the associated density of states @xmath12 . as an example , for @xmath2 we have calculated a histogram over @xmath32 vectors for both dimensions .",
