    "our results also showed that a profile made of gas , without a modified potential or without significant dm contributions could not fit the observed profiles .",
    "our constraints on model parameters are rather weak since we only used the data on the cluster profile but we did not use the frequency dependence of the tsz effect , the reason being that the planck collaboration has not released foreground cleaned maps at each frequency .",
