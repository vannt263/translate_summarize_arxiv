    "elliptic flow @xcite is the key observable characterizing the collectivity @xcite of the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) that is potentially produced in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions at the bnl relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) or / and at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "a fast transformation from the initial spatial anisotropy to the momentum anisotropy will indicate sufficiently strong interactions among quarks and gluons , which also provides the reason for a fast thermalization to a qgp with a small shear viscosity .",
    "the good agreements of the elliptic flow @xmath0 data at rhic @xcite with the results from calculations employing ideal hydrodynamics @xcite suggest that the shear viscosity of the qgp created at rhic is small @xcite . to find its lower and upper",
    "bound is an important but difficult task , because the elliptic flow is built up not only during the evolution of the qgp but also initially during the thermalization and finally , though possibly marginal , during the hadronic cascade before particles decouple kinetically .",
    "moreover , the lack of understanding of the hadronization leads to an uncertainty in converting the partonic elliptic flow to the hadronic one that is measured .",
    "all these contributions to the final hadronic elliptic flow can , in principle , be investigated in a transport calculation including a partonic and a hadronic cascade and a hadronization mechanism @xcite .",
    "such studies will help to determine the true shear viscosity in the qgp phase .",
    "recently , employing the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) based parton cascade boltzmann approach of multiparton scatterings ( bamps ) @xcite , we have calculated the elliptic flow @xmath0 of the gluon matter produced in au+au collisions at the rhic energy @xcite . to compare our results with the experimental data the gluonic @xmath0 was converted to the hadronic one using the parton - hadron duality picture at a freezeout energy density of @xmath5 @xmath6 .",

    "( [ p22])@xmath3([p32 ] ) @xcite .",

    "although the integrated @xmath0 of gluons from the bamps calculations with @xmath9 and @xmath5 @xmath81 agree perfectly with the experimental data ( see the red curve with open squares in fig . [ v2 ] ) , the differential @xmath1 ( the red curve with open squares in fig .",
    "[ v2pt ] and red curves in fig .",
    "[ v2pt2 ] ) are 20@xmath350@xmath4 smaller than the data , especially at intermediate momenta @xmath86 gev @xmath87 gev .",
    "correspondingly , the @xmath8 spectra of gluons , shown in fig .",
    "[ dndpt ] , are flatter than those of hadrons at rhic .",
    "the larger the centrality , the larger is the difference between the data and the results from the calculations .",
    "discrepancy with the rhic data is also seen in the mean transverse momentum , @xmath88 , which is shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ meanpt ] as a function of @xmath76 .",
    "the points are star data @xcite within @xmath89 , whereas the curves with symbols are the bamps results for gluons within @xmath78 .",
    "the mean @xmath8 of gluons is larger than that of charged hadrons . on the other hand , the total transverse energy of gluons per rapidity at midrapidity , shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ meanpt ] , agrees with the experimental data including hadronic and electromagnetic components @xcite .",
    "we notice that the results of @xmath90 with a larger coupling constant of @xmath9 are 7@xmath315@xmath4 smaller than those with @xmath10 ( also smaller than the data ) because of the larger longitudinal work during a less viscous hydrodynamical expansion .",
    "however , if quarks are included in bamps calculations , the transverse energy will be slightly enlarged .",
    "@xmath90 agrees rather well with the data but @xmath88 is larger than the data .",
    "this thus indicates that the gluon number per rapidity is smaller than that of the hadron number per rapidity .",
    "the parton - hadron duality with one gluon to one pion seems too simple to describe the complex hadronization . to obtain @xmath88 that agrees with the data , each gluon is expected to `` fragment '' to 1.5@xmath32 pions on average .",
    "the larger the centrality ( peripheral collisions ) , the more fragments are needed , because initial hard gluon jets are less quenched in peripheral collisions because of their small reaction size .",
    "possible fragmentation of each gluon to more pions suggests @xmath91 and @xmath92 with @xmath93 1.5@xmath32 .",
    "the obtained @xmath94 for low @xmath95 gev would come closer to the experimental data . because the integrated @xmath0 is determined mostly by the lower @xmath8 particles , the integrated @xmath0 of pions will be nearly the same as that of gluons .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath94 for @xmath96 gev would be still 20@xmath350@xmath4 smaller than the data .",
    "the discrepancy is larger for more peripheral collisions ( see fig .",
    "[ v2pt2 ] ) .",
    "it seems that quark recombination models @xcite for hadronization are appropriate for intermediate @xmath8 gluons , if one assumes that each gluon must first be converted to a quark - antiquark pair @xmath97 via @xmath98 .",
    "then the quark recombination models would give @xmath99 .",
    "we also must stress that the results discussed above are obtained from the present calculations without quark degrees of freedom .",
    "the inclusion of quarks will certainly change the freezeout temperature , because the freezeout energy density is proportional to the degeneracy factor of partons , @xmath100 , where @xmath18 for gluons and @xmath101 for quarks with two flavors . for the same freezeout energy density the freezeout temperature will be a factor of @xmath102 smaller when the quarks are included and if all the partons are chemically equilibrated . although the initial energy is slightly enlarged when including quarks , we do not expect much stronger transverse flow at freezeout , as long as the shear viscosity of the parton system is the same with or without quarks .",
    "therefore , the inclusion of quarks might reduce the mean @xmath8 by a factor of @xmath102 , which then would lead to a fair agreement between the calculated and the experimentally measured mean @xmath8 via parton - hadron duality .",
    "if the integrated @xmath0 is still comparable with the experimental data , then @xmath1 will also come to a closer agreement with the data .",
    "work in this direction is in progress .",
    "the parton - hadron duality picture is consistent with the hadronization in a thermalized expanding matter , which assumes that both constituents of the bulk matter at the beginning and at the end of the hadronization will be distributed according to thermal statistics .",
    "if the temperature does not change much during the phase transition , the integrated @xmath0 , @xmath1 and the @xmath8 spectra of pions are almost the same as those of partons .",
    "although the energy density of pions is smaller than that of partons , the matter will expand continuously during the hadronization , which leaves the total energy , and the total particle number and , thus , the entropy of the constituents approximately unchanged . within the picture of a thermalized expanding source the dependence of @xmath1 on the hadron mass",
    "was also understood @xcite and agrees with the rhic data at lower @xmath103 gev @xcite .    on the other hand , the star data @xcite confirmed quark recombination models @xcite for hadronization of quarks with intermediate @xmath104 1@xmath32 gev .",
    "these models lead to @xmath105 for @xmath106 for mesons and for @xmath107 for baryons , which is obviously different from the picture of a thermalized expanding source .",
    "how the transition from one to another hadronization scenario proceeds is not clear . also , how gluons convert into quarks and antiquarks in the recombination models has to be understood and modeled .",
    "we emphasize that how the partons hadronize is essential to obtain a complete picture of the generation of elliptic flow and to understand the transformation of the @xmath1 , the @xmath8 spectra , and the mean @xmath8 from the partonic to the hadronic phase in a consistent manner .",
    "quantitative calculations modeling hadronization may give a more detailed understanding of this subject . as a starting point",
    ", an algorithm employing a cooper - frye prescription @xcite will be implemented in bamps in the near future .",
    "detailed comparisons with results from recent calculations using viscous hydrodynamics @xcite will be given .",
    "finally , the gluons in the present bamps calculations are assumed as boltzmann particles rather than bosons because of numerical difficulties .",
    "bose enhancement increases the gluon density by a factor of @xmath108 for a thermal gluon system .",
    "moreover , the enhancement at low @xmath8 is considerably larger than that at large @xmath8 .",
    "this may also have a moderate effect on the @xmath8 dependence of the elliptic flow and thus will be investigated in more detail .",
    "the elliptic flow @xmath0 will be continuously built up if the spatial anisotropy of the particle system still exists and sufficiently strong interactions among particles are present .",
    "the buildup of @xmath0 does not necessarily mean that @xmath0 becomes always larger .",
    "after the time when the eccentricity crosses zero the system will turn spatially anisotropic again but with the sign opposite to the eccentricity of the initial one .",
    "further evolution will then decrease @xmath0 .",
    "whether or not a generation of negative @xmath0 occurs depends on whether the kinetic freezeout of the particle system happens after or before the time when the initial eccentricity crosses zero .    in this section",
    "we discuss the dependence of the elliptic flow on the freezeout condition in au+au collisions at the rhic energy . in the present bamps calculations",
    "the kinetic and chemical freezeouts are assumed to occur at the same time when the local energy density drops below the chosen cutoff value of @xmath64 .",
    "the cutoff @xmath64 serves as a critical energy density , at which gluons are converted to hadrons . after the phase transition",
    "no hadronic interactions take place in the present version of bamps .",
    "we have already speculated that a realistic modeling of hadronization may change the pattern of @xmath1 in various ways .",
    "moreover , a hadronic cascade simulating the decoupling stage should be included @xcite . with the hadronic cascade",
    ", the kinetic freezeout happens later than the hadronization and the final elliptic flow will likely be different from that obtained in the present bamps calculations .",
    "however , this difference is expected to be rather marginal , because the viscosity in the hadron gas is much larger than that in the qgp .",
    "although the freezeout is considered in a simple way in the present bamps , it is useful to study the uncertainty in the calculated @xmath0 , if the value of the critical energy density @xmath64 is varied to change the lifetime of the qgp .",
    "if the freezeout condition constrains the elliptic flow , then it also constrains the to be deduced shear viscosity of the qgp . for this purpose",
    ", we have performed calculations with @xmath68 @xmath81 in addition to those with @xmath5 @xmath81 .",
    "the results are shown in figs .",
    "[ v2]@xmath3[v2pt2 ] and [ meanpt ] by green curves with open triangles ( @xmath10 ) and purple curves with open diamonds ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "we realize that the @xmath0 results with @xmath10 and @xmath68 @xmath81 ( green curves with open triangles ) are almost identical to those with @xmath9 and @xmath5 @xmath81 ( red curves with open squares ) .",
    "stronger interactions or longer qgp phase leads to the same final values of @xmath0 . figure [ v2 t ] shows the @xmath0 generation as a function of time in a au+au collision with an impact parameter of @xmath52 fm .    no decrease of @xmath0",
    "is observed .",
    "this indicates that the freezeout occurs before the initial spatial anisotropy vanishes .",
    "the saturation of @xmath0 begins at @xmath109 fm / c for @xmath5 @xmath81 and later at @xmath40 fm / c for @xmath68 @xmath81 .",
    "the continuous increase of @xmath0 after @xmath109 fm / c in the case for @xmath68 @xmath81 is as strong as that before .",
    "the difference of the pressure gradient between the @xmath110 and @xmath29 directions is still large at @xmath109 fm / c , whereas at this time the freezeout at @xmath5 @xmath81 is nearly complete .",
    "therefore , the uncertainty in the final elliptic flow due to the different freezeout condition is not small .",
    "in addition to the hadronization , the time scale when the hadronization occurs affects also the absolute value of @xmath0 as well as the transverse momentum dependence of @xmath0 .",
    "a detailed study of the elliptic flow is important , because this collective effect of qcd matter quantitatively constrains the shear viscosity of the medium . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have demonstrated within the bamps calculations that the shear viscosity to the entropy density ratio @xmath12 is nearly constant in time and approximately depends only on the coupling constant @xmath80 : @xmath111 for @xmath10 and @xmath112 for @xmath9 . from fig .",
    "[ v2 ] we see that with either @xmath10 and @xmath68 @xmath81 or @xmath9 and @xmath5 @xmath81 the same values of the final @xmath0 are obtained and which agree very well with the experimental data .",
    "therefore , according to the present study , @xmath12 is most probably lying between @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "if the freezeout occurs at a lower energy density ( or temperature ) , one would expect that the transverse momentum spectra will become softer and the final transverse energy will be smaller . from the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ meanpt ] we see that @xmath90 for @xmath68 @xmath81 are only slightly smaller than those for @xmath5 @xmath81 .",
    "the differences in the transverse momentum spectra ( not shown ) are also tiny .",
    "the further decrease of the local energy density from @xmath51 to @xmath113 @xmath81 due to the longitudinal work done by the pressure is marginal , because at the late stage of expansion the system becomes dilute and thus the work done is small .",
    "free streaming increases the transverse flow and thus effectively decreases the local energy density .",
    "therefore , a lower energy density cutoff for the freezeout does not lead to a much smaller total transverse energy and mean transverse momentum , as seen in fig .",
    "[ meanpt ] . on the other hand , the @xmath1 for @xmath9 and @xmath68 @xmath81 , shown by the purple curve with open diamonds in fig .",
    "[ v2pt ] and by purple curves in fig .",
    "[ v2pt2 ] , agree well with the data at the low @xmath103 gev , whereas the integrated @xmath0 ( see the purple curve with open diamonds in fig .",
    "[ v2 ] ) overestimate the data .",
    "we note that within the same description for the gluon interactions the energy loss of high @xmath8 gluons is found to be in good agreement with the results from the glv formalism when @xmath10 is used @xcite .",
    "hence both jet - quenching phenomena and the buildup of elliptic flow are rather well described in bamps parton cascade calculations .",
    "employing the pqcd based parton cascade bamps that includes pqcd bremsstrahlung and its backreaction we have calculated the elliptic flow @xmath0 in au+au collisions at @xmath2 gev .",
    "hadronization is assumed to happen at a critical energy density , @xmath64 .",
    "a gluon is then fragmented into a pion according to the parton - hadron duality assumption .",
    "the hadron @xmath0 is therefore identical to the final gluon @xmath0 within the present bamps calculations .",
    "we found that whereas the final gluon @xmath0 from the calculations with @xmath9 and @xmath5 @xmath81 agree well with the data , the transverse momentum dependence @xmath1 are 20@xmath350@xmath4 lower then the data in each centrality class .",
    "the final gluon transverse momentum spectra are harder than the data and also the final gluon mean transverse momenta are 40@xmath3100@xmath4 larger than the data",
    ". however , the final gluon transverse energy per rapidity at midrapidity agrees with the data .",
    "this indicates that the hadronization process via the parton - hadron duality is not justified . a realistic hadronization that transforms a gluon to 1.5@xmath32 pions on average",
    "would be expected for low @xmath8 gluons , whereas at intermediate @xmath8 , quark recombination would be a better scenario of hadronization . in addition , the inclusion of quark degrees of freedom would reduce the final parton mean @xmath8 and would lead to a better agreement between the calculated and measured @xmath1 .",
    "this must be demonstrated in a new version of bamps calculations including the quark dynamics and employing various hadronization scenarios .",
    "the value of the final gluon @xmath0 depends on the freezeout condition , i.e. , @xmath64 .",
    "the pressure gradient difference in the @xmath110 and @xmath29 directions at @xmath5 @xmath81 is still large enough to further increase the elliptic flow if @xmath64 is changed to a smaller but still reasonable value .",
    "we observed that the final gluon @xmath0 and @xmath1 are almost the same in the calculations with either @xmath9 and @xmath5 @xmath81 or @xmath10 and @xmath68 @xmath81 .",
    "stronger interactions or a later freezeout leads to the same elliptic flow .",
    "this outlines the uncertainty in the extraction of the shear viscosity in the qgp : the shear viscosity to the entropy density ratio will most probably be between @xmath14 and @xmath13 .",
    "we furthermore conclude that adding quark degrees of freedom into the dynamical evolution of the qcd matter with a detailed understanding of the hadronization of gluons and quarks will be helpful in explaining the viscous facets of the final hadron elliptic flow and in extracting the shear viscosity to the entropy density ratio of the qgp .",
