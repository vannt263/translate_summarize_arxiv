    "let us first explore that of the flat manifolds . in this section we will describe things in quite some detail , since a good understanding of this part is indispensable for the rest of the text .",
    "the material in this section is standard and can be found in e.g.  @xcite .",
    "we also refer to these references for all the proofs of the results mentioned in this section .",
    "let @xmath0 be the @xmath1-dimensional euclidean space .",
    "by @xmath2 , we will denote the group of isometries of euclidean @xmath1-space .",
    "any element @xmath3 can be written as a composition of an orthogonal map @xmath4 and a translation @xmath5 , for some @xmath6 . the orthogonal map @xmath7 is a linear map and so we can identify @xmath7 with its matrix representation with respect to the standard orthogonal basis of @xmath0 . after this identification , we can say that @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the group of orthogonal @xmath10 matrices .",
    "it follows that any element @xmath11 of @xmath2 can be identified with a tuple @xmath12 .",
    "now , let @xmath13 and @xmath14 be two isometries , then @xmath15 from which it follows that @xmath16 is represented by the tuple @xmath17 . as a consequence",
    ", it follows that @xmath2 is the semidirect product group @xmath18 .",
    "recall that to construct the semidirect product of two groups @xmath19 and @xmath20 , one first chooses a morphism @xmath21 , then the semidirect product @xmath22 , or just @xmath23 when @xmath24 is clear from the context , is the group where the underlying set is the cartesian product @xmath25 and where the product is given by @xmath26 it is an easy exercise to show that this construction indeed yields a group .",
    "when @xmath27 is the trivial morphism , the result of forming the semidirect product @xmath28 is the ordinary direct product @xmath25 of two groups . of course , when @xmath19 and @xmath20 are lie groups ( or topological groups ) , one requires the usual continuity in this construction .",
    "note that both @xmath19 and @xmath20 can be seen as subgroups of @xmath28 by identifying them with @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively . under this identification",
    ", we have that @xmath19 is a normal subgroup of @xmath28 , while in general @xmath20 is not normal .",
    "the projection @xmath31 is a group morphism , with kernel @xmath19 .    in the situation above",
    ", any orthogonal map @xmath7 can be seen as a ( continuous ) morphism of the abelian group @xmath0 and so there is an inclusion @xmath32 and it is this inclusion which is used as the morphism @xmath24 to construct the semidirect product @xmath18 .",
    "analogously , we can construct the affine group @xmath33 .",
    "so elements of @xmath34 are tuples @xmath35 and the product is given by @xmath36 it is obvious that @xmath37 .",
    "of course , also elements of the affine group @xmath34 can be seen as maps of @xmath0 , where just as for the isometry group we have that @xmath38 for all @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "it follows that there is a left action of @xmath34 on @xmath0 given by @xmath41 as a consequence , also any subgroup @xmath42 of @xmath34 ( or of @xmath2 ) acts on @xmath0 .",
    "the groups @xmath34 and @xmath2 are lie groups ( using the usual smooth manifold structures on the underlying sets @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) .",
    "as mentioned above when introducing the semidirect product of two groups , we can view @xmath0 as a normal subgroup of @xmath2 and @xmath34 . in both cases , this is exactly the group of translations .",
    "when @xmath45 , we will then write @xmath46 for the group of translations in @xmath19 , which is then a normal subgroup of @xmath19 . we will use @xmath47 to denote the projection on the second factor . for any @xmath45 , we will call @xmath48 the linear part of @xmath19 and @xmath46 the translational part .",
    "we have that @xmath49 .",
    "a flat manifold will be constructed as an orbit space @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is acting properly discontinuously , freely and cocompactly on @xmath0 . for completeness ,",
    "let us recall the notions we ve just mentioned .",
    "let @xmath19 be a group acting ( continuously ) on a locally compact topological space @xmath52 .    1 .",
    "we say that @xmath19 acts properly discontinuously on @xmath52 if for every compact subset @xmath53 it holds that @xmath54 2 .",
    "the action of @xmath19 on @xmath52 is cocompact if the orbit space @xmath55 is compact .",
    "the action is free if @xmath56 , i.e.  the stabilizer of any @xmath57 is trivial .",
    "we are now ready to introduce the class of crystallographic groups    a @xmath1dimensional crystallographic group , is a cocompact and discrete subgroup of @xmath2 .",
    "a bieberbach group is a torsion free crystallographic group .    a subgroup @xmath58 of @xmath2 is cocompact , if and only if the action of @xmath58 on @xmath2 by left translations is cocompact , i.e.  the space of cosets @xmath59 is compact .",
    "the following proposition gives rise to an alternative description of a crystallographic ( bieberbach ) group in terms of the induced action on @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath58 be a subgroup of @xmath2 .",
    "then we have    1 .",
    "@xmath58 is a discrete subgroup of @xmath2 @xmath60 the action of @xmath58 on @xmath0 is properly discontinuous .",
    "2 .   @xmath58 is cocompact in @xmath2 @xmath61 the action of @xmath58 on @xmath0 is cocompact .",
    "3 .   if @xmath58 is a discrete subgroup of @xmath2 , then @xmath58 is torsion free @xmath60 the action of @xmath58 on @xmath0 is free .    from this proposition",
    "it follows that a @xmath1-dimensional crystallographic group @xmath58 is a subgroup of @xmath2 which acts properly discontinuously and cocompactly on @xmath0 .",
    "a @xmath1-dimensional bieberbach group is a @xmath1-dimensional crystallographic group for which the action on @xmath0 is also free .    in case @xmath58",
    "is a @xmath1-dimensional bieberbach group , the quotient space @xmath62 is a manifold and as @xmath63 , the manifold locally inherits the metric structure of euclidean space @xmath0 .",
    "it follows that @xmath64 is a compact riemannian manifold with constant curvature 0 , i.e.  a compact flat manifold .",
    "conversely , any compact flat @xmath1-dimensional manifold can be obtained as a quotient space @xmath65 , where @xmath58 is a @xmath1-dimensional bieberbach group . moreover , for bieberbach groups , the natural projection @xmath66 is a covering with @xmath58 as its group of deck transformations and so the fundamental group of the flat manifold @xmath65 is exactly @xmath58 .",
    "before , we proceed let us present some examples of crystallographic and bieberbach groups .    1 .",
    "let @xmath67 ( @xmath68 will be used to denote the @xmath10-identity matrix ) , then @xmath69 consists of pure translations , is a discrete and cocompact subgroup of @xmath2 and hence is a bieberbach group .",
    "the corresponding manifold @xmath70 is the @xmath1-dimensional torus .",
    "2 .   let @xmath71 .",
    "then @xmath72 contains @xmath73 as a subgroup of index 2 , from which it easily follows that also @xmath72 is a crystallographic group .",
    "however , @xmath72 is not torsion free , so @xmath72 is not a bieberbach group .",
    "[ klein]let @xmath74 be the subgroup of @xmath75 , which is generated by @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 ( we are writing elements of @xmath0 as column vectors ) .",
    "note that @xmath79 .",
    "the group generated by @xmath80 and @xmath81 is isomorphic to @xmath82 and is a subgroup of index 2 in @xmath74 .",
    "using this , it is not so difficult to see that @xmath74 is a crystallographic group .",
    "moreover , @xmath74 is torsion free and hence a bieberbach group",
    ". we leave it to the reader to check that @xmath83 is the klein bottle .",
    "the structure of crystallographic groups is well understood by the bieberbach theorems (",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , which we recall here    let @xmath63 be a @xmath1-dimensional crystallographic group , then the group of translations @xmath84 of @xmath58 is a lattice in @xmath0 and is of finite index in @xmath58 .    by a lattice of @xmath0 we mean a cocompact and discrete subgroup of @xmath0 .",
    "lattices of @xmath0 are isomorphic to @xmath85 and each minimal generating set of a lattice of @xmath0 is in fact a basis of the vector space @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath63 be a @xmath1-dimensional crystallographic group , then its linear part @xmath86 is called the holonomy group of @xmath58 .    the term holonomy is well chosen , because when @xmath58 is a bieberbach group , the holonomy group of @xmath58 is really the holonomy group of the flat manifold @xmath62 .",
    "this fact will not be used further in this text , but the interested reader can consult @xcite for more details .",
    "the first bieberbach theorem states that a @xmath1-dimensional crystallographic group @xmath58 fits is a short exact sequence @xmath87 where @xmath88 is a finite group .",
    "of course , being isomorphic to @xmath85 , the translation group @xmath89 is abelian .",
    "it is not so difficult to show that @xmath89 is maximal abelian in @xmath58 .",
    "let @xmath90 be an isomorphism between two crystallographic groups , then @xmath58 and @xmath91 are of the same dimension , say @xmath1 , and moreover , there exists an affine map @xmath92 such that @xmath93    note that @xmath94 is a conjugation inside @xmath34 .",
    "this makes sense because both @xmath58 and @xmath91 are subsets of @xmath2 and so also of @xmath34 .    geometrically , this theorem says that a compact flat manifold is , up to an affine equivalence , completely determined by its fundamental group .",
    "the last bieberbach theorem then states that , for a fixed @xmath1 , there are up to affine equivalence only finitely many @xmath1-dimensional compact flat manifolds .    for any positive integer @xmath1 , there are , up to isomorphism ( or up to affine conjugation ) , only finitely many @xmath1-dimensional crystallographic groups .    in @xcite , zassenhaus proved a converse to the first bieberbach theorem , which results in a complete algebraic characterization of the @xmath1-dimensional crystallographic groups :    let @xmath58 be a @xmath1-dimensional crystallographic group , then @xmath58 fits in a short exact sequence @xmath95 where @xmath88 is finite and @xmath96 is maximal abelian in @xmath58 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath58 is an abstract group fitting in a short exact sequence as above , where @xmath88 is finite and @xmath96 is maximal abelian in @xmath58 , then there exists an embedding @xmath97 such that @xmath98 is a @xmath1-dimensional crystallographic group .",
    "a little bit more can be said : when @xmath58 is a crystallographic group , then @xmath89 is the unique normal abelian subgroup of @xmath58 which is also maximal abelian .",
    "hence , as @xmath89 is completely determined by algebraic properties , @xmath89 is a characteristic subgroup of @xmath58 .    by choosing a free generating set of the free abelian group @xmath99 , the short exact sequence @xmath100 ( where @xmath101 ) induces a representation @xmath102 by conjugation in @xmath58 .",
    "this representation is often referred to as the holonomy representation of @xmath58 .",
    "as @xmath103 we can also via @xmath24 as a representation into @xmath104 ( we then talk about the rational holonomy representation[ratholon ] ) or into @xmath105 ( the real holonomy representation ) .",
    "note that also @xmath106 induces a representation @xmath107 .",
    "one can see that @xmath108 and @xmath24 are conjugate inside @xmath105 .    as a flat manifold @xmath64 is , up to affine equivalence , completely determined by its fundamental group , a bieberbach group @xmath58",
    ", it should not come as a surprise that much of the geometry ( or topology ) of the manifold @xmath64 can be studied on the algebraic level .",
    "very often , the holonomy representation plays a crucial role .",
    "we refer the reader to the book @xcite to see quite some examples of this .",
    "in later sections of this article we will see that this is also the case for infra - nilmanifolds .",
    "when moving from the class of flat manifolds ( crystallographic groups ) to the class of infra - nilmanifolds ( almost crystallographic groups ) , we will replace the abelian groups @xmath85 and @xmath0 by their nilpotent analogues .",
    "it is therefore useful to spend some time describing these nilpotent groups , as in the previous section , this material is standard and we omit all proofs . for discrete nilpotent groups we refer the reader to @xcite for more details , while for lie group aspects the references @xcite are a good starting point for more information .",
    "let @xmath19 be any group , then we define the terms of the upper central series @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) and those of the lower central series @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) inductively as follows : @xmath113 @xmath114 .\\ ] ] note that a group is abelian @xmath115 . as a generalization of abelian groups , we can consider groups for which the upper central series eventually stabilizes at @xmath19 or where the lower central series eventually stabilizes at the trivial group .",
    "the following lemma shows that both points of view lead to the same class of groups .",
    "let @xmath19 be a group , then for any positive integer @xmath116 we have that @xmath117    a group @xmath19 is nilpotent of class @xmath118 if and only if @xmath119 ( if and only if @xmath120 ) .",
    "we say that @xmath19 is nilpotent of class @xmath116 if @xmath116 is the smallest positive integer for which @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "it follows that the abelian groups are exactly the nilpotent groups of class 1 .",
    "let @xmath121 be the group of upper triangular @xmath122 integral matrices .",
    "then , @xmath20 is a nilpotent group of class @xmath123 .",
    "the group @xmath20 is often referred to as the ( integral ) heisenberg group + more generally , for any commutative ring @xmath124 with 1 , the group of upper triangular @xmath10 matrices with entries in @xmath124 and 1 s everywhere on the diagonal , say @xmath125 , is a nilpotent group of class @xmath126 .",
    "( e.g.  see @xcite )    it is easy to prove that subgroups and quotient groups of nilpotent groups are also nilpotent ( of at most the same class as the original group ) .    in the setting of crystallographic groups ,",
    "the abelian groups @xmath85 play a crucial role , since any crystallographic group contains such a group as a characteristic subgroup of finite index .",
    "the groups @xmath85 are exactly the finitely generated and torsion free abelian groups . in the generalized",
    "setting of almost  crystallographic groups , the role of those @xmath85 will be replaced by the finitely generated and torsion free nilpotent groups .",
    "so , since our aim is to discuss infra - nilmanifolds and almost  crystallographic groups in detail , it is necessary to obtain a good understanding of those finitely generated torsion free nilpotent groups .",
    "let @xmath127 be a nilpotent group , then    1 .",
    "if @xmath127 is finitely generated , then any subgroup of @xmath127 is finitely generated ( since @xmath127 is a polycyclic group ) .",
    "if @xmath127 is torsion free , then for any positive integer @xmath128 also @xmath129 is torsion free    note that for a torsion free nilpotent group @xmath127 , it is not necessarily true that @xmath130 is torsion free .",
    "e.g.  for any positive integer @xmath1 we define @xmath131 is a torsion free nilpotent group ( where @xmath132 is the heisenberg group @xmath20 which we already met in the example above )",
    ". one can compute that @xmath133 it follows from the lemma above that for a given finitely generated torsion free nilpotent group @xmath127 of class @xmath118 , we have that @xmath134 is a filtration of @xmath127 with @xmath135 for some integers @xmath136 . by refining this filtration ( and numbering in the other direction )",
    ", we can find a series of normal subgroups @xmath137 of @xmath127 : @xmath138 with @xmath139 and @xmath140 ( which is equivalent to @xmath141\\subseteq n_{i+1}$ ] ) .",
    "now , given a series of subgroups @xmath137 of @xmath127 satisfying these conditions , we fix an element @xmath142 for all @xmath128 , in such a way that the natural projection of @xmath143 in @xmath144 is a generator of the infinite cyclic group @xmath144 .",
    "it is then obvious to see that any element @xmath145 can be uniquely expressed as an element of the form @xmath146 we will refer to @xmath147 as a malcev basis for @xmath127 .",
    "[ polprod ] let @xmath127 be a finitely generated torsion free nilpotent group with malcev basis @xmath148 , then there exist polynomials @xmath149 ( @xmath150 ) with coefficients in @xmath151 and polynomials @xmath152 ( @xmath150 ) also with coefficients in @xmath151 such that for all @xmath153 we have that    1 .",
    "@xmath154 @xmath155 2 .",
    "@xmath156 @xmath157    using these polynomials , we can now construct two new groups , @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "these groups consist formally of the elements @xmath160 where the @xmath161 ( respectively @xmath162 ) and where the product rule is given by means of the same polynomials @xmath163 . both @xmath158 and @xmath159",
    "are torsion free nilpotent groups ( but of course , they are no longer finitely generated ) .",
    "the group @xmath158 is a radicable group , this is a group such that any element of @xmath158 has a ( unique ) @xmath164th root in @xmath158 ( for all positive integers @xmath164 ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath158 is the radicable closure of @xmath127 , i.e.  it is a radicable group containing @xmath127 and any element of @xmath158 has a positive power lying in @xmath127 .",
    "this implies that @xmath158 is the smallest radicable group containing @xmath127 .",
    "this property does determine @xmath158 uniquely up to isomorphism .",
    "often @xmath158 is referred to as the rational malcev completion of @xmath127 .",
    "[ ratmalcev ] it is easy to see that when @xmath165 , then @xmath166 . for the integral heisenberg group",
    "we have that @xmath167 in fact , for every @xmath168 we have that @xmath169 .",
    "let @xmath170 be a morphism between two finitely generated torsion free nilpotent groups .",
    "then @xmath24 uniquely extends to a morphism @xmath171 .",
    "moreover , when @xmath24 is an isomorphism , so is @xmath172 .",
    "the proof of the proposition is not difficult , since it is easy to see that the morphism @xmath24 is expressed as a polynomial map in terms of coordinates with respect to chosen malcev bases of @xmath173 and @xmath174 . using the same polynomial map ,",
    "one then defines the morphism between @xmath175 and @xmath176 ( but now allowing also rational coordinates ) .    in the example [ ratmalcev ] above we saw that it is possible that @xmath177 , but @xmath178 .",
    "this occurs exactly when the groups @xmath173 and @xmath174 are commensurable .",
    "two groups @xmath173 and @xmath174 are said to be ( abstractly ) commensurable if there exists finite index subgroups subgroups @xmath179 and @xmath180 such that @xmath181 .",
    "let @xmath173 and @xmath174 be two finitely generated torsion free nilpotent groups , then @xmath182    the group @xmath159 is called the real malcev completion of @xmath127 .",
    "this is a lie group .",
    "indeed as a manifold @xmath159 is diffeomorphic to @xmath183 and the group operations are polynomial in the coordinates , so these are certainly smooth .",
    "the group @xmath159 is a simply connected nilpotent lie group which contains @xmath127 as a discrete cocompact subgroup . generalizing the abelian case",
    ", we will refer to a discrete and cocompact subgroup @xmath127 of a simply connected lie group @xmath19 as a lattice of @xmath19 .",
    "it is known that , up to a lie group isomorphism , @xmath159 is the unique connected and simply connected nilpotent lie group containing @xmath127 as a lattice .",
    "analogously to the situation for rational malcev completions , we have the following result :    let @xmath170 be a morphism between two finitely generated torsion free nilpotent groups .",
    "then @xmath24 uniquely extends to a continuous morphism @xmath184",
    ". moreover , when @xmath24 is an isomorphism , so is @xmath185 .",
    "to study radicable nilpotent groups , like @xmath158 , or nilpotent lie groups , like @xmath159 , it is often useful to move over to their associated lie algebras .",
    "the rest of this section is devoted to the description of this connection in our situation . to explain this , it is easy to make use of the following result :    let @xmath127 be a finitely generated torsion free nilpotent group .",
    "then there exists an embedding @xmath186 , for some @xmath1 .",
    "so any finitely generated torsion free nilpotent group can be realized as a subgroup of some @xmath187 and any subgroup of @xmath187 is a finitely generated torsion free nilpotent group .    from now",
    "onwards , we will assume that @xmath188 let us now use @xmath189 to denote the set of @xmath10 upper triangular matrices with entries in the ring @xmath124 and with a 0 everywhere on the diagonal .",
    "so all elements of @xmath189 are nilpotent matrices . by considering the usual lie bracket @xmath190=ab - ba$ ] for matrices ,",
    "one easily sees that @xmath191 ( resp .",
    "@xmath192 ) is a lie algebra over @xmath151 ( resp .  over @xmath162 ) .",
    "we introduce two maps : @xmath193 and @xmath194 where @xmath68 is the @xmath10 identity matrix .",
    "+ note that in the definitions above , we have that the matrices @xmath7 and @xmath195 appearing in the expression for @xmath196 and @xmath197 respectively , are nilpotent matrices and so the infinite sums are actually finite sums .",
    "the maps @xmath196 and @xmath197 are each others inverse and so are both bijective .    the campbell  baker ",
    "hausdorff formula provides a relation between the multiplication in the group @xmath198 and the lie bracket in the lie algebra @xmath192 .",
    "this formula says that @xmath199 @xmath200 + \\frac{1}{12 } ( [ x,[x , y ] ] + [ y,[y , x ] ] ) + \\sum_{k=4}^\\infty r_k \\right)\\ ] ] where each @xmath201 is a rational combination of @xmath202fold lie brackets in @xmath52 and @xmath203 .",
    "again the sum is in fact a finite sum , since @xmath202-fold brackets are 0 when @xmath202 is big enough .",
    "let @xmath204 and take @xmath205 @xmath206 then    1 .",
    "@xmath207 is a rational lie algebra and @xmath208 .",
    "@xmath209 is a real lie algebra and @xmath210 .",
    "we remark here that the isomorphism type of the lie algebras @xmath207 and @xmath209 are independent of the chosen embedding of @xmath127 into @xmath187 ( even into some @xmath211 and this also for various @xmath1 ) and so is really an invariant of the group @xmath127 .",
    "this correspondence behaves nicely on the level of ( iso)morphisms :    [ differential ] let @xmath173 and @xmath174 be two finitely generated torsion free nilpotent groups and let @xmath212 or @xmath162 .",

    "on the other hand , in stead of focussing on the geometric structure itself , we can focus on the group @xmath9 ( of transformations of the vector space @xmath0 preserving the inner product ) .",
    "this group @xmath9 is a maximal compact subgroup of @xmath266 and is in this sense uniquely determined up to inner conjugation inside @xmath266 .",

    "the adjective `` expanding '' for these kind of affine maps is well chosen ( @xcite ) :    an expanding infra - nilmanifold endomorphism of an infra - nilmanifold @xmath64 is indeed an expanding map of that infra - nilmanifold .",
    "moreover , as a corollary to his famous theorem on groups of polynomial growth , m.  gromov showed that these kind of expanding maps are essentially the only ones ( @xcite , but see also @xcite ) :    let @xmath652 be an expanding map on a closed manifold @xmath64 , then @xmath11 is topologically conjugate to an expanding infra - nilmanifold endomorphism .",

    "there has been a lot of research on the existence question of anosov diffeomorphisms for nilmanifolds , especially in low dimensional cases or for nilmanifolds modeled on very special types of nilpotent lie groups ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "so , in the case of anosov diffeomorphisms there is no hope to find a result in the sense of theorem  [ exp - main ] .",

    "when we want to generalize the above theorem to the case of infra - nilmanifolds , we need to restrict ourselves to certain classes of them e.g.  by considering only infra - nilmanifolds modeled on well understood nilpotent lie groups @xmath19 .",
