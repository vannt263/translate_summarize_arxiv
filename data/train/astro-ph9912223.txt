    "iras all - sky redshift surveys have been used to study the cosmological dipole by strauss and davis ( 1988 , 1.94 jy sample ) , rowan - robinson et al ( 1990 , qdot sample ) and strauss et al ( 1992 , 1.2 jy sample ) . in this paper",
    "we report results from the new iras pscz redshift survey ( saunders et al 1995 , 1997 , 1999 in preparation ) , which includes redshifts for over 15000 iras galaxies with 60 @xmath6 m fluxes brighter than 0.6 jy .    the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) dipole is interpreted as a doppler effect arising from the motion of the local group of galaxies through the cosmological frame .",
    "the iras studies cited above showed clearly for the first time that this motion could be explained as due to the net attraction of matter , distributed broadly like the galaxies , within 150 @xmath1 mpc . if the galaxy distribution gives an unbiassed picture of the total matter distribution , values for the cosmological density parameter @xmath4 of 0.5 - 1.0 and 0.22 - 0.76 ( @xmath7 range ) were found by rowan - robinson et al ( 1990 ) and strauss et al ( 1992 ) , respectively . if the galaxy distribution is linearly biased with respect to the matter distribution , so that    ( @xmath8 = b ( @xmath9 ,    then it is preferable to work in terms of the parameter @xmath2 . the values for @xmath10 found from a variety of large - scale structure studies using iras galaxy samples",
    "have been summarized by dekel ( 1994 ) , strauss and willick ( 1995 ) and rowan - robinson ( 1997 ) . in the latter review",
    "it was shown that whether averaged for different methods using the same iras sample , or averaged for different iras samples using the same method , the values of @xmath10 were all consistent with a mean value of 0.80 @xmath11 0.15 .",
    "one of the main interests of the present study is whether the iras dipole does in fact converge by 150 @xmath1 mpc , or whether major contributions to the motion of the local group arise at larger distances , as proposed by raychaudhury ( 1989 ) , scaramella et al ( 1989 ) , and plionis and valdarnini ( 1991 ) .",
    "the convergence of cosmological dipoles has been discussed by vittorio and juskiewicz ( 1987 , juskiewicz et al ( 1990 ) , lahav et al ( 1990 ) , peacock ( 1992 ) and strauss et al ( 1992 ) ( see section 7 below ) .",
    "other results from the pscz survey have been presented by canavezes et al ( 1998 ) , sutherland et al ( 1999 ) , tadros et al ( 1999 ) , branchini et al ( 1999 ) , schmoldt et al ( 1999 ) , and sharpe et al ( 1999 ) .",
    "the iras pscz sample contains 15459 galaxies brighter than 0.6 jy at 60 @xmath6 m in 84 @xmath12 of the sky .",
    "saunders et al ( 1995 , 1997 , 1999 in preparation ) have described the construction of the pscz sample , which is based on the iras galaxy catalogue of rowan - robinson et al ( 1990 ) . improved 60 @xmath6 m fluxes",
    "have been derived for extended sources .",
    "in addition to the redshifts measured in the qdot survey ( rowan - robinson et al 1990 , lawrence et al 1999 ) and in the 1.2 jy survey ( strauss et al 1992 ) , and those galaxies with redshifts already determined in the literature , we measured the redshifts of a further 4500 galaxies .",
    "the data reduction for these observations was performed primarily by keeble ( 1996 ) .",
    "the redshift distribution for the sample is shown in fig 1 , together with the selection function assumed in this paper , which is derived from a luminosity function of the form assumed by saunders et al ( 1989 ) with @xmath13 ( all assuming @xmath14 = 100 ) and luminosity evolution of the form @xmath15 ( the normalisation has been increased by 10@xmath12 to give the correct total number of sources ) .",
    "the identifications are believed to be complete over the unmasked sky to v = 30,000 km / s ( but see section 3 ) .",
    "we have used a simple window function which is 1 for 4 @xmath16 300 @xmath17 and zero otherwise .",
    "only galaxies with 60 @xmath6 m luminosities in the range @xmath18 are used in the dipole calculation .",
    "strauss et al ( 1992 ) discuss the effects of different assumptions about the window function , which are small compared with other factors .",
    "because parts of the sky were either not covered by iras or are too severely confused by emission from our galaxy or the magellanic clouds to be useful for extragalactic studies , part of the sky ( 16 @xmath12 ) is masked .",
    "this basic mask has been defined by the i(100@xmath6 m ) = 25 mjy@xmath19sr contour .",
    "there have been a variety of approaches to how to correct for the masked sky .",
    "strauss and davis ( 1988 ) and rowan - robinson et al ( 1990 ) filled the masked area with a poissonian distribution of sources .",
    "lynden - bell et al ( 1989 ) suggested that the sky at @xmath20 be filled by cloning adjacent latitude strips ( a similar method is employed by yahil et al 1991 , strauss et al 1992 ) .",
    "scharf et al ( 1992 ) emphasized the power of a spherical harmonic approach in bridging what is known about the unmasked sky across the masked areas .",
    "lahav et al ( 1994 ) refined the spherical harmonic approach by using wiener filtering .",
    "a major part of the present study has been the exploration of the effects of different approaches to filling the masked areas on the results .    our first attempt to treat the mask was as follows .",
    "the mask is defined in terms of iras lune bins , a binning of the sky in 1 sq deg areas defined in ecliptic coordinates .",
    "we divided the sky into 413 areas each of approximately 100 sq deg and compiled statistics on the proportion of each of these 100 sq deg areas which lie in the mask .",
    "areas in which more than 0 @xmath12 but less than 25 @xmath12 of the area is masked are then filled by resampling the data in that area to select fluxes and velocities , and then placing the coordinates at random in the masked area .    where more than 25 @xmath12 of the area is masked , or the number of sources falls below 10 ( compared with an average per 100 sq deg area of 40 ) , the areas are filled using one of two algorithms : ( a ) the area is filled with flux - velocity pairs randomly selected from the whole data set , to the average density over the sky , at random locations within the masked area , ( b ) the area is filled with flux - velocity pairs randomly selected from two neighbouring bins which are at least 75 @xmath12 full , at random locations within the masked area . both methods retain the radial density structure of the pscz data set , but method ( b ) assumes that there is strong correlation over scales of 10 degrees , whereas method ( a ) assumes no correlation . the truth is likely to lie between these two assumptions .",
    "figs 2 - 4 show the pscz data , where the zones of complete avoidance can be clearly seen , and the augmented data with the mask filled by these two methods .",
    "both distributions look reasonably convincing . where the masked areas are filled from neighbouring bins , spatial structure can be seen to bridge the galactic plane more dramatically .",
    "however both these treatments were found to result in strong changes to the dipole amplitude and direction , especially for the x- and y - components ( where the z - axis is towards the galactic pole and the x - axis towards the galactic centre ) , at distances between 200 and 300 @xmath1 mpc .",
    "this drift in the dipole components can be seen in the preliminary results from this study shown by saunders et al ( 1998 , fig 3 ) .",
    "these changes did not appear to correspond to actual structures in the galaxy distribution . to test whether this could be due to anisotropic incompleteness in the pscz survey at large distances , we show in fig 5 the sky distribution of pscz galaxies for which we do not have redshifts .",
    "it does appear that there is a strong concentration of pscz sources which we believe to be galaxies , but for which we do not have redshifts , towards the galactic anticentre .",
    "these are likely to be preferentially galaxies at larger distances .",
    "thus in filling the mask with clones of galaxies from more complete regions , we are generating a spurious component in the positive x - direction , seen as the upwards drift of the x - component of the dipole at large distances .    to compensate for this effect we model the incompleteness by supposing that the completeness limit varies smoothly from 15,000 km@xmath19s at i(100 ) = 25 mjy@xmath19sr to 30,000 km@xmath19s at i(100 ) = 12.5 mjy@xmath19sr .",
    "the sample is then completed to 30,000 km@xmath19s through this zone using a new method based on spherical harmonics ( saunders et al , 1999 , in prep ) .",
    "the galaxies are assumed to be poisson - sampled from a lognormal underlying distribution , and the harmonics giving the maximum likelihood for the galaxy distribution outside the mask determined .",
    "the method allows interpolation on mildly non - linear scales , where the linear weiner - filtering method ( e.g. lahav etal 1994 ) breaks down . a regularisation term , equivalent to that used in weiner filtering , is added to the likelihood to damp out noise fluctuations .    the masked areas ( i(100 ) @xmath21 25 mjy@xmath19sr ) are then filled in two ways : ( c ) with a random distribution of iras galaxies , ( d ) with a clustered distribution derived from the spherical harmonic analyis of the unmasked data described above .",
    "in linear theory the peculiar velocity at position @xmath22 can be derived as ( peebles 1980 )    @xmath23 = @xmath24 @xmath25 , ( 1 )    where @xmath26 .    for a redshift survey of a galaxy population which samples the density field and satisfies a universal luminosity function @xmath27(l , z ) ,",
    "independently of @xmath28 , the rhs of eqn ( 1 ) can be evaluated as    @xmath29 , ( 2 )    where n is the average density of galaxies and @xmath30 is the selection function .",
    "we refer to @xmath31 , the predicted velocity of the local group , as the cosmological dipole .",
    "the problem is that eqn ( 2 ) requires us to know the true distance of galaxies , whereas we know only the observed radial velocity , which includes the effect of the galaxy s peculiar velocity .",
    "we have first calculated the dipole as in rowan - robinson et al ( 1990 ) for several different assumptions about the velocity field .",
    "\\(1 ) in the local group frame , correcting only for the effects of galactic rotation .",
    "this would be valid if the cmb dipole was generated at distances beyond those sampled by the pscz data .",
    "\\(2 ) in the cmb frame .",
    "this would be valid if the cmb dipole were generated very locally .",
    "\\(3 ) in a crude model for the velocity field , in which no correction ( apart from galactic rotation ) is applied to galaxies with recession velocity v @xmath32 , whereas galaxies with v @xmath33 are corrected for the cmb motion .",
    "this assumes that galaxies with v @xmath32 move together as a block .",
    "@xmath34 was taken as 3000 km / s .",
    "figs 6 show the dipole amplitude , summed out to distance d , as a function of d , in these 3 models for the augmented data with the masked area filled according to prescription ( d ) ( spherical harmonics ) .",
    "clearly different flow models can dramatically affect the dipole amplitude .",
    "we use model ( 3 ) as the starting point for our iterative derivation of the dipole in real space in section 6 .",
    "in order to correct the observed redshifts for peculiar motions and convert to real space , we follow an approach similar in spirit to that of rowan - robinson et al ( 1990 ) . we seek to make an analytic model of the density field , from which the implied peculiar velocities can be calculated and corrected .",
    "the quality of the pscz data allows us to be far more ambitious with this model than rowan - robinson et al ( 1990 ) , whose model used only 10 clusters ( and no voids ) . here",
    "we try to use all prior knowledge about galaxy clustering out to 30,000 km@xmath19s .",
    "our initial input cluster lists consists of    * \\(1 ) the galaxy groups with v @xmath35 2500 km / s from rowan - robinson ( 1988 ) , which are in turn based on group lists by de vaucouleurs ( 1976 ) and geller and huchra ( 1983 ) .",
    "these are included to try to give some resolution of nearby structure . *",
    "\\(2 ) a compilation of abell clusters with v @xmath35 30000 km / s ( abell et al 1989 , postman et al 1992 , dalton et al 1994 ) . * \\(3 ) an additional list of clusters for which distance estimates have been given in the literature ( sandage 1975 , lucey and carter 1988 , mould et al 1991 , 1993 ) .    because of the good all - sky sampling of the pscz survey it is worthwhile to supplement these lists with clusters and voids found in the pscz data set itself as follows .",
    "the data binned in 100 sq deg bins as in section 3 is further binned in 40 velocity bins , whose boundaries are chosen using the selection function to give the same number of galaxies in each velocity bin ( on average about 1 per bin ) .",
    "the 413 x 40 array is then searched for bins in which the number of galaxies exceeds a threshold ( taken to be 4 galaxies in a bin ) to yield a supplementary list of clusters .",
    "the array is also searched for voids , which are defined to be sequences of 5 contiguous velocity bins containing no galaxies .",
    "a few ( 25 ) additional potential clusters which seemed to be visible in the 3-dimensional distribution , but which were missed by this procees , were inserted by hand ( numbered pc1000 onwards ) .",
    "the complete list of clusters and voids is subject to a neighbours search to weed out duplicates .",
    "\\(a ) d @xmath35 25 @xmath1 mpc    * rationalize all cluster or group pairs within 2 @xmath1 mpc of each other ( this eliminates 6 nearby groups ) * eliminate all pscz - selected clusters within 4 @xmath1 mpc of known groups or clusters * rationalize void pairs within 4 @xmath1 mpc of each other    \\(b ) d @xmath21 25 @xmath1 mpc    * rationalize all cluster pairs within 4 @xmath1 mpc of each other ( this eliminates 21 clusters ) * eliminate all pscz - selected clusters within 8 @xmath1 mpc of a known cluster * rationalize void pairs within 8 @xmath1 mpc of each other    this procedure is necessary to avoid clusters disrupting their neighbours during the iteration .",
    "the final input cluster list contains 88 nearby groups , 854 clusters and 163 voids ( cluster / void list and parameters for final flow model available by ftp ) .",
    "an iterative least - squares process now selects the pscz galaxies within a specified distance of the cluster or void centres and looks for infall ( clusters )    @xmath36 , ( 3 )    ( equivalent to a characterist density profile @xmath37 )    or outflows ( voids )    @xmath38 .",
    "( valid for a region of constant below - average density )    if a void is found to be completely empty of galaxies , so a can not be estimated in this way , then a is set to be    a = 100 @xmath39    which is the relevant value for an empty void .    from a least - squares analysis",
    "we find @xmath40 for cluster infall and we adopt the value @xmath41 = 0.6 .",
    "we set a limit for the size of clusters and voids defined as follows :    * for nearby groups ( and voids ) within 25 @xmath1mpc , a maximum radius of 4 @xmath1mpc , except for the virgo , fornax and puppis clusters , and the local void ( see below ) : * for all other clusters within 100 @xmath1mpc , a maximum radius of 16 @xmath1mpc : * for all other voids within 100 @xmath1mpc , a maximum radius of 8 @xmath1mpc : * for clusters with distances greater than 100 @xmath1mpc , a maximum radius of 32 @xmath1mpc : * for voids with distances greater than 100 @xmath1mpc , a maximum radius of 16 @xmath1mpc .",
    "a maximum size has to be set to prevent clusters swallowing their neighbours .",
    "the increase in maximum size with distance reflects the worsening resolution of the model .",
    "the cluster - void model is then used to predict the peculiar velocity field and the radial distance of each pscz galaxy is adjusted accordingly before entering the next iteration . the triple - valued zone around each cluster",
    "is treated as follows . for a cluster with amplitude a , a core radius @xmath42mpc is defined within which infall to the cluster can overwhelm the hubble flow . within this zone",
    "there is ambiguity about which side of the cluster the galaxy lies on ( in front or behind ) .",
    "if the cluster model places the galaxy within this distance of the centre of the cluster , the galaxy is assigned a distance equal to that of the cluster centre and then is not included in the infall solution . to avoid excessive feedback ,",
    "the core radius is in practice damped by multiplying by 0.75 . without this , clusters tend to grow in size and swallow all the galaxies around them into their core , thereby disappearing from the solution .    the local volume , d @xmath35 25 h@xmath0 mpc , requires especial care , as the resolution of the iras sample is not adaquate for arriving at an accurate model .",
    "it is clear that virgo and eridanus - fornax are dominant structures in the local flow .",
    "there is the possibility of additional significant structures behind the galactic plane .",
    "for example it has been proposed that there is an important local structure in the direction of puppis ( lahav et al 1993 ) and several other groups or clusters within this volume at @xmath43 have been identifed in the pscz cluster searches described above .",
    "finally , inspection of the 3-dimensional galaxy distribution shows that the local void ( saunders et al 1991 ) occupies most of one quadrant of the local volume .",
    "these structures have been treated as follows : virgo , eridanus , puppis and the other clusters / groups at @xmath43 were allowed to grow to a maximum size of 16 @xmath1mpc , ie they were assumed to be comparable to an abell cluster .",
    "the local void was allowed to grow to a maximum size of 8 @xmath1mpc , ie was assumed to be comparable to other voids at d @xmath35 100 @xmath1mpc .",
    "the resulting model of the local flow can be compared with the results form the least action analysis of sharpe et al ( 1999 ) , in which the orbits of the nearby galaxies are followed in detail .",
    "to bring our results into agreement with those of sharpe et al , we had to move the centre of the local void from d = 25 @xmath1mpc , estimated by saunders et al ( 1991 ) from analaysis of the qdot sample , to 9 @xmath1mpc . at this distance",
    "it exerts a dynamic effect on our galaxy comparable to that of the virgo cluster .",
    "the puppis cluster was not found to have a very strong effect on our galaxy s motion .",
    "however two other clusters , pc1000 at ( l , b ) = ( 310,5 ) , d = 14.5 @xmath1 , and pc1001 at ( l , b ) = ( 279,10 ) , d = 28.4 @xmath1mpc , proved to be important new structures , with mass comparable to virgo ( the centre of the former lies in the masked region , and it is less prominent when the mask is filled homogeneously ) . in order of the peculiar velocity generated at the local group ( given in brackets in km s@xmath0 ) ,",
    "the 10 most significant individual structures are virgo ( 162 ) , the local void ( 127 ) , pc1000 ( 119 ) , pc1001 ( 67 ) , awm7 ( part of per - pis , 62 ) , a3526 ( cen , 42 ) , a2052 ( her , 40 ) , n2997 gp ( 33 ) , a3565 ( n.cen , 31 ) , and s805 ( pavo , 29 ) .",
    "the goodness of fit of the infall model for clusters can be tested by calculating the change in @xmath44 when the model is implemented , using the velocity error estimates of tayor and valentine ( 1999 ) .",
    "for the spherical harmonic mask - fill , @xmath44 changes from 8247 to 4583 for 4111 degrees of freedom , demonstrating that the fit to the local infall by eqn ( 3 ) is good .",
    "the cluster - void model is used , as described in the previous section , to convert the pscz data to a real space data set . note that this model is fully non - linear , to within the limitations implied by the assumed spherical symmetry of the clusters and voids , although the data to which it is being fitted are based on the linear assumption ( eqn ( 1 ) ) .",
    "the initial velocity field is defined by the crude model ( 3 ) of section 3 , and is then improved in a series of iterations until a a self - consistent model of the flow - field is obtained .",
    "we have also iterated the value of @xmath10 in eqn ( 1 ) in order to arrive at a fully self - consistent flow model .",
    "fig 7,8 shows the components of the dipole in real space , with the predictions of the cluster - void model , for the two different mask treatments ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "the fit of the cluster / void model to the pscz dipole components is excellent . in calculating the dipole from iras galaxies",
    "we have excluded the contribution of galaxies within 4 @xmath1 mpc .",
    "similarly in computing the total dipole contribution of the cluster and group model we have excluded groups within the same volume .",
    "the lack of adaquate sampling in the local volume could result in a constant offset vectors between each of the iras dipole , the cluster+void model dipole , and the true dipole .",
    "the cmb dipole also has to include the not very well determined vector of the sun s motion with respect to the local group of galaxies .",
    "we have assumed that the sun s velocity with respect to the local group is 300 km@xmath19s towards ( l , b ) = ( 90,0 ) , consistent with the values measured by yahil et al ( 1977 ) .",
    "the offset found between the pscz dipole and the cmb direction is 21.7@xmath5 at 150 @xmath1mpc , 18.0@xmath5 at 200 @xmath1mpc , 15.5@xmath5 at 250 @xmath1mpc , and 13.4@xmath5 at 300 @xmath1mpc .",
    "strauss et al ( 1992 ) analyzed the expected offset in a range of models using simulations and compared these predictions with the data for the 1.2 jy sample .",
    "although the misalignment between the iras and cmb dipoles has been advocated as a test of cosmological parameters ( juskiewicz et al 1990 , lahav et al 1990 , strauss et al 1992 ) , the problem is that density structure in the masked region could have a strong effect on the x and y components ( especially the x component ) .",
    "it is noticable that the component which shows the greatest discrepancy with the cmb dipole is the x - component . a cluster behind the galactic centre at the distance of , and with twice the mass of , the centaurus cluster ( a3526 ) would bring the dipoles to alignment within 5@xmath5 . since such a hypothetical object can not be rules out , there is little cosmological information in the dipole misalignment .",
    "other possible reasons for misalignment are that iras galaxies may be subtly biased with respect to the mass distribution or that there may be non - linear corrections to eqn ( 1 ) .",
    "fig 9,10 shows the total dipole amplitude as a function of distance for the two assumptions about the mask .",
    "the uncertainties in the dipole amplitude for the pscz sample have been estimated by taylor and valentine ( 1999 ) , including the effects both of cosmic variance and shot noise and these are included in figs 9 , 10 .",
    "the prediction for the cluster / void model is also shown in each case .",
    "there is some difference between the predicted dipole amplitudes for the two mask - filling assumptions , amounting to 140 @xmath45 at 200 @xmath1 mpc for an assumed @xmath10 = 1 .",
    "thus some of the disagreements about values of @xmath10 in different studies stem from different assumptions about how to fill the mask .",
    "it is clearly worth investigating other methods of filling the masked sky .",
    "however the missing information can not actually be recovered and we have to regard the different amplitudes found from the two methods of filling the mask as indicative of the uncertainty induced by the incomplete sky coverage of pscz . also plotted in fig 10 is the dipole amplitude from the qdot study by rowan - robinson et al ( 1990 , as corrected by lawrence et al 1999 ) , which should be comparable with the case where the mask is filled by the average sky .",
    "the agreement is excellent over the distance range in common .",
    "other approaches to the problem of dynamical reconstructing include the iterative schemes of yahil et al ( 1991 ) and the spherical harmonic analysis with wiener filtering of fisher et al ( 1995 ) , heavens and taylor ( 1995 ) .",
    "our method is not only stabler than the method of yahil et al ( 1991 ) , but it also yields an analytic model of the flow throughout the survey volume . the spherical harmonic approach is less subject to the bias of starting from known cluster and group lists , entailed in our approach .",
    "however there is a considerable cosmographic benefit in being able to relate the flow to identifiable structures and in a subsequent paper we will demonstrate the benefit of this for studies of the hubble constant ( and claimed anomalies like the lauer - postman effect ) .",
    "since we can be sure that some galaxy structures extend across the masked regions , the treatment of filling the mask homogeneously is unlikely to be realistic , so in what follows we give results for the case where the mask is filled using spherical harmonics .",

    "<S> the conversion from redshift space to real space is accomplished by using an analytical model of the cluster and void distribution , based on 88 nearby groups , 854 clusters and 163 voids , with some of the clusters and all of the voids found from the pscz database .    </S>",
    "<S> the dipole for the whole pscz sample appears to have converged within a distance of 200 @xmath1mpc and yields a value for @xmath2 = 0.75 ( + 0.11,-0.08 ) , consistent with earlier determinations from iras samples by a variety of methods . for b = 1 , </S>",

    "<S> the direction of the dipole is within 13@xmath5 of the cmb dipole , the main uncertainty in direction being associated with the masked area behind the galactic plane . </S>",
    "<S> the improbability that further major contributions to the dipole amplitude will come from volumes larger than those surveyed here means that the question of the origin of the cmb dipole is essentially resolved .    0.0 in 0.0 in 9.0 in 6.25 in    infrared : cosmology : observations </S>"
