    "in differential geometry one finds many different normal forms results which share the same flavor . in the last few years we have come to realize that there is more than a shared flavor to many of these results : they are actually instances of the same general result . the result in question is a linearization result for lie groupoids , first conjectured by alan weinstein in @xcite .",
    "the first complete proof of the linearization theorem was obtained by nguyen tien zung in @xcite . since then several clarifications and simplifications of the proof , as well as more general versions of this result , were obtained ( see @xcite ) . in these lectures",
    "notes we give an overview of the current status of the theory .",
    "the point of view followed here , which was greatly influenced by an ongoing collaboration with matias del hoyo @xcite , is that the linearization theorem can be thought of as an ehresmann s theorem for a submersion onto a stack .",
    "hence , its proof should follow more or less the same steps as the proof of the classical ehresmann s theorem , which can be reduced to a simple argument using the exponential map of a metric that makes the submersion riemannian .",
    "although i will not go at all into geometric stacks ( see the upcoming paper @xcite ) , i will adhere to the metric approach introduced in  @xcite .",
    "let us recall the kind of linearization theorems that we have in mind .",
    "the most basic is precisely the following version of ehresmann s theorem :    let @xmath0 be a * proper * surjective submersion .",
    "then @xmath1 is locally trivial : for every @xmath2 there is a neighborhood @xmath3 , a neighborhood @xmath4 , and diffeomorphism : @xmath5_{\\text{pr } } \\ar[rr]^{\\cong } & & \\pi^{-1}(u)\\subset m\\ar[d]^{\\pi}\\\\ v\\ar[rr]^{\\cong } & & u } \\ ] ]    one can also assume that there is some extra geometric structure behaving well with respect to the submersion , and then ask if one can achieve `` linearization '' of both the submersion and the extra geometric structure .",
    "for example , if one assumes that @xmath6 is a closed 2-form such that the pullback of @xmath7 to each fiber is non - degenerate , then one can show that @xmath1 is a locally trivial symplectic fibration ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we will come back to this later , for now we recall another basic linearization theorem :    let @xmath8 be a foliation of @xmath9 and let @xmath10 be a compact leaf of @xmath8 with * finite holonomy*. then there exists a saturated neighborhood @xmath11 , a @xmath12-invariant neighborhood @xmath13 , and a diffeomorphism : @xmath14^{\\cong } & & u\\subset m}\\ ] ] sending the linear foliation to @xmath15 .    here",
    ", @xmath16 denotes the holonomy cover , a @xmath12-principal bundle , and the holonomy group @xmath12 acts on the normal space @xmath17 via the linear holonomy representation . by",
    " linear foliation \" we mean the quotient of the horizontal foliation @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "notice that this result generalizes ehresmann s theorem , at least when the fibers of the submersion are connected : any leaf of the foliation by the fibers of @xmath1 has trivial holonomy so @xmath12 acts trivially on the transversal , and then reeb s theorem immediately yields ehresmann s theorem .",
    "for this reason , maybe it is not so surprising that the two results are related .",
    "let us turn to a third linearization result which , in general , looks to be of a different nature from the previous results .",
    "it is a classical result from equivariant geometry often referred to as the slice theorem ( or tube theorem ) :    let @xmath20 be a lie group acting in a * proper * fashion on @xmath9 . around any orbit @xmath21",
    "the action can be linearized : there exist @xmath20-invariant neighborhoods @xmath22 and @xmath23 and a @xmath20-equivariant diffeomorphism : @xmath24^{\\cong } & & u\\subset m}\\ ] ]    here @xmath25 acts on the normal space @xmath26 via the normal isotropy representation .",
    "if the action is locally free then the orbits form a foliation , the isotropy groups @xmath27 are finite and @xmath28 is a quotient of @xmath27 . moreover",
    ", the action of @xmath29 on a slice descends to the linear holonomy action of @xmath28 .",
    "the slice theorem is then a special case of the reeb stability theorem .",
    "however , in general , the isotropy groups can have positive dimension and the two results look apparently quite different .",
    "again , both in the case of foliations and in the case of group actions , we could consider extra geometric structures ( e.g. , a metric or a symplectic form ) and ask for linearization taking into account this extra geometric structure .",
    "one can find such linearization theorems in the literature ( e.g. , the local normal form theorem for hamiltonian actions @xcite ) .",
    "let us mention one such recent result from poisson geometry , due to crainic and marcut @xcite :    let @xmath30 be a poisson manifold and let @xmath31 be a compact symplectic leaf . if the poisson homotopy bundle @xmath32 is a smooth * compact * manifold with vanishing second de rham cohomology group , then there is a neighborhood @xmath33 , and a poisson diffeomorphism : @xmath34    we will not discuss here the various terms appearing in the statement of this theorem , referring the reader to the original work @xcite .",
    "however , it should be clear that this result has the same flavor as the previous ones : some compactness type assumption around a leaf / orbit leads to linearization or a normal form of the geometric structure in a neighborhood of the leaf / orbit .",
    "although all these results have the same flavor , they do look quite different .",
    "moreover , the proofs that one can find in the literature of these linearization results are also very distinct .",
    "so it may come as a surprise that they are actually just special cases of a very general linearization theorem .    in order to relate all these linearization theorems , and to understand the significance of the assumptions one can find in their statements",
    ", one needs a language where all these results fit into the same geometric setup .",
    "this language exists and it is a generalization of the usual lie theory from groups to groupoids . we will recall it in the next lecture . after that , we will be in shape to state the general linearization theorem and explain how the results stated before are special instances of it .",
    "in this lecture we provide a quick introduction to lie groupoids and lie algebroids .",
    "we will focus mostly on some examples which have special relevance to us .",
    "a more detailed discussion , along with proofs , can be found in @xcite .",
    "let us start by recalling :    a * groupoid * is a small category where all arrows are invertible .",
    "let us spell out this definition .",
    "we have a * set of objects * @xmath9 , and a * set of arrows * @xmath35 . for each arrow",
    "@xmath36 we can associate its source @xmath37 and its target @xmath38 , resulting in two maps @xmath39 .",
    "we also write @xmath40 for an arrow with source @xmath41 and target @xmath42 .    for any pair of composable arrows we have a * product * or composition map : @xmath43 in general ,",
    "we will denote by @xmath44 the set of @xmath45 strings of composable arrows : @xmath46 the multiplication satisfies the _ associativity property _ : @xmath47    for each object @xmath48 there is an identity arrow @xmath49 and the _ identity property _ holds : @xmath50 it gives rise to an * identity section * @xmath51 , @xmath52 .    for each arrow",
    "@xmath36 there is an inverse arrow @xmath53 , for which the _ inverse property _ holds : @xmath54 this gives rise to the * inverse * map @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "a * morphism of groupoids * is a functor @xmath57 .",
    "this means that we have a map @xmath58 between the sets of arrows and a map @xmath59 between the sets of objects , making the following diagram commute : @xmath60^{{\\mathbf{t } } } \\ar@<-0.25pc>[d]_{{\\mathbf{s } } } \\ar[r]^{{\\ensuremath{\\mathcal{f } } } } & h \\ar@<0.25pc>[d]^{{\\mathbf{t}}}\\ar@<-0.25pc>[d]_{{\\mathbf{s } } } \\\\",
    "m \\ar[r]_{f } & n}\\ ] ] such that @xmath61 if @xmath62 are composable , and @xmath63 for all @xmath48 .",
    "we are interested in groupoids and morphisms of groupoids in the smooth category :    a * lie groupoid * is a groupoid @xmath64 whose spaces of arrows and objects are both manifolds , the structure maps @xmath65 are all smooth maps and such that @xmath66 and @xmath67 are submersions .",
    "a * morphisms of lie groupoids * is a morphism of groupoids for which the underlying map @xmath58 is smooth .",
    "before we give some examples of lie groupoids , let us list a few basic properties .",
    "* the unit map @xmath51 is an embedding and the inverse @xmath55 is a diffeomorphism . *",
    "the source fibers are embedded submanifolds of @xmath35 and * right multiplication by @xmath40 * is a diffeomorphism between @xmath66-fibers @xmath68 * the target fibers are embedded submanifolds of @xmath35 and * left multiplication by @xmath40 * is a diffeomorphism between @xmath67-fibers : @xmath69 * the * isotropy group at @xmath41 * : @xmath70 is a lie group . * the * orbit through @xmath41 * : @xmath71 is a regular immersed ( possibly disconnected ) submanifold . *",
    "the map @xmath72 is a principal @xmath73-bundle .",
    "the connected components of the orbits of a groupoid @xmath64 form a ( possibly singular ) foliation of @xmath9 .",
    "the set of orbits is called the * orbit space * and denoted by @xmath74 .",
    "the quotient topology makes the natural map @xmath75 into an open , continuous map . in general",
    ", there is no smooth structure on @xmath74 compatible with the quotient topology , so @xmath74 is a singular space .",
    "one may think of a groupoid as a kind of atlas for this orbit space .",
    "there are several classes of lie groupoids which will be important for our purposes .",
    "a lie groupoid @xmath64 is called * source @xmath76-connected * if the @xmath77-fibers @xmath78 are @xmath76-connected for every @xmath48 . when @xmath79 we say that @xmath35 is a * @xmath77-connected groupoid * , and when @xmath80 we say that @xmath35 is a * @xmath77-simply connected groupoid*. we call the groupoid * tale * if @xmath81 , which is equivalent to requiring that the source or target map be a local diffeomorphism .",
    "the map @xmath82 is sometimes called the * anchor of the groupoid * and a groupoid is called * proper * if the anchor @xmath82 is a proper map . in particular , when the source map is proper , we call the groupoid * s - proper*. we will see later that proper and s - proper groupoids are , in some sense , analogues of compact lie groups .",
    "perhaps the most elementary example of a lie groupoid is the * unit groupoid * @xmath83 of any manifold @xmath9 : for each object @xmath48 , there is exactly one arrow , namely the identity arrow . more generally , given an open cover @xmath84 of @xmath9 one constructs a * cover groupoid",
    "* @xmath85 : we picture an arrow as @xmath86 if @xmath87 .",
    "the structure maps should be obvious . in both these examples ,",
    "the orbit space coincides with the original manifold @xmath9 and the isotropy groups are all trivial .",
    "these are all examples of proper , tale , lie groupoids . if the open cover is not second countable , then the spaces of arrows and objects are not second countable manifolds . in lie",
    "groupoid theory one sometimes allows manifolds which are not second countable .",
    "however , we will always assume manifolds to be second countable .",
    "another groupoid that one can associate to a manifold is the * pair groupoid * @xmath88 : an ordered pair @xmath89 determines an arrow @xmath90 .",
    "this is an example of * transitive groupoid * , i.e. , a groupoid with only one orbit .",
    "more generally , if @xmath91 is a principal @xmath20-bundle , then @xmath20 acts on the pair groupoid @xmath92 by groupoid automorphisms and the quotient @xmath93 is a transitive groupoid called the * gauge groupoid*. note that for any @xmath48 the isotropy group @xmath73 is isomorphic to @xmath20 and the principal @xmath73-bundle @xmath94 is isomorphic to the original principal bundle .",
    "conversely , it is easy to see that any transitive groupoid @xmath64 is isomorphic to the gauge groupoid of any of the principal @xmath73-bundles @xmath94 .",
    "it is easy to check that that the gauge groupoid associated with a principal @xmath20-bundle @xmath95 is proper if and only if @xmath20 is a compact lie group .",
    "moreover , it is s - proper ( respectively , source @xmath76-connected ) if and only if @xmath96 is compact ( respectively , @xmath76-connected ) .    to any surjective submersion @xmath0",
    "one can associate the * submersion groupoid * @xmath97 .",
    "this is a subgroupoid of the pair groupoid @xmath88 , but it fails to be transitive if @xmath98 has more than one point : the orbits are the fibers of @xmath0 , so the orbit space is precisely @xmath98 .",
    "the isotropy groups are all trivial .",
    "the submersion groupoid is always proper and it is s - proper if and only if @xmath1 is a proper map .",
    "let @xmath8 be a foliation of a manifold @xmath9 .",
    "we can associate to it the * fundamental groupoid * @xmath99 , whose arrows correspond to foliated homotopy classes of paths ( relative to the end - points ) . given such an arrow @xmath100 $ ] , the source and target maps are @xmath101)=\\gamma(0)$ ] and @xmath102)=\\gamma(1)$ ] , while multiplication corresponds to concatenation of paths .",
    "one can show that @xmath103 is indeed a manifold , but it may fail to be hausdorff .",
    "in fact , this groupoid is hausdorff precisely when @xmath8 has no vanishing cycles . in lie groupoid theory ,",
    "one often allows the total space of a groupoid to be non - hausdorff , while @xmath9 and the source / target fibers are always assumed to be hausdorff . on the other hand",
    ", we will always assume manifolds to be second countable .",
    "another groupoid one can associate to a manifold is the * holonomy groupoid * @xmath104 , whose arrows correspond to holonomy classes of paths .",
    "again , one can show that @xmath105 is a manifold , but it may fail to be hausdorff . in general ,",
    "the fundamental groupoid and the holonomy groupoid are distinct , but there is an obvious groupoid morphism @xmath106 , which to a homotopy class of a path associates the holonomy class of the path ( recall that the holonomy only depends on the homotopy class of the path ) .",
    "this map is a local diffeomorphism .",
    "it should be clear that the leaves of these groupoids coincide with the leaves of @xmath8 and that the isotropy groups of @xmath103 ( respectively , @xmath105 ) coincide with the fundamental groups ( respectively , holonomy groups ) of the leaves .",
    "it is easy to check also that @xmath103 is always @xmath77-connected .",
    "one can show that @xmath103 ( respectively , @xmath105 ) is s - proper if and only if the leaves of @xmath8 are compact and have finite fundamental group ( respectively , finite holonomy group ) .",
    "in general , it is not so easy to give a characterization in terms of @xmath8 of when these groupoids are proper",
    ".    let @xmath107 be a smooth action of a lie group @xmath20 on a manifold @xmath9 .",
    "the associated * action groupoid * @xmath108 has arrows the pairs @xmath109 , source / target maps given by @xmath110 and @xmath111 , and composition : @xmath112 the isotropy groups of this action are the stabilizers @xmath27 and the orbits coincide with the orbits of the action .",
    "the action groupoid is proper ( respectively , s - proper ) precisely when the action is proper ( respectively , @xmath20 is compact ) .",
    "moreover , this groupoid is source @xmath76-connected if and only if @xmath20 is @xmath76-connected .",
    "lie groupoids , just like lie groups , have associated infinitesimal objects known as _ lie algebroids _ :",
    "a * lie algebroid * is a vector bundle @xmath113 together with a lie bracket @xmath114_a:\\gamma(a)\\times\\gamma(a)\\to \\gamma(a)$ ] on the space of sections and a bundle map @xmath115 , such that the following leibniz identity holds : @xmath116_a = f[{\\alpha},{\\beta}]_a+\\rho_a(x)(f ) y,\\ ] ] for all @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "given a lie groupd @xmath64 the associated lie algebroid is obtained as follows .",
    "one lets @xmath119 be the vector bundle whose fibers consists of the tangent spaces to the s - fibers along the identity section",
    ". then sections of @xmath120 can be identified with right - invariant vector fields on the lie groupoid , so the usual lie bracket of vector fields induces a lie bracket on the sections .",
    "the anchor is obtained by restricting the differential of the target , i.e. , @xmath121 .",
    "there is a lie theory for lie groupoids / algebroids analogous to the usual lie theory for lie groups / algebras .",
    "there is however one big difference : lie s third theorem fails and there are examples of lie algebroids which are not associated with a lie groupoid ( @xcite ) .",
    "we shall not give any more details about this correspondence since we will be working almost exclusively at the level of lie groupoids .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a detailed discussion of lie theory in the context of lie groupoids and algebroids .",
    "for a lie groupoid @xmath64 a submanifold @xmath122 is called * saturated * if it is a union of orbits . our aim now is to state the linearization theorem which , under appropriate assumptions , gives a normal form for the lie groupoid in a neighborhood of a saturated submanifold .",
    "first we will describe this local normal form , which depends on some standard constructions in lie groupoid theory .",
    "let @xmath64 be a lie groupoid . the * tangent lie groupoid * @xmath123 is obtained by applying the tangent functor : hence , the spaces of arrows and objects are the tangent bundles to @xmath35 and to @xmath9 , the source and target maps are the differentials @xmath124 , the multiplication is the differential @xmath125 , etc .",
    "assume now that @xmath31 is a saturated submanifold .",
    "an important special case to keep in mind is when @xmath126 consists of a single orbit of @xmath35",
    ". then we can restrict the groupoid @xmath35 to @xmath126 : @xmath127 obtaining a lie subgroupoid @xmath128 of @xmath64 .",
    "if we apply the tangent functor , we obtain a lie subgroupoid @xmath129 of @xmath123 .",
    "there is a short exact sequence of lie groupoids : @xmath130 & tg_s \\ar@<0.25pc>[d ] \\ar@<-0.25pc>[d ] \\ar[r ] & tg \\ar@<0.25pc>[d ] \\ar@<-0.25pc>[d ] \\ar[r ]   & \\nu(g_s)\\ar@<0.25pc>[d ] \\ar@<-0.25pc>[d ] \\ar[r ] & 1\\\\ 0\\ar[r ]   & ts \\ar[r ] & tm \\ar[r ] & \\nu(s)\\ar[r ] & 0}\\ ] ]    there is an alternative description of the groupoid @xmath131 which sheds some light on its nature . for each arrow @xmath132 in @xmath133 one can define the linear transformation : @xmath134 \\mapsto [ { \\mathrm d}_g{\\mathbf{t}}(\\tilde v)],\\ ] ] where @xmath135 is such that @xmath136 .",
    "one checks that this map is independent of the choice of lifting @xmath137 .",
    "moreover , for any identity arrow one has @xmath138id@xmath139 and for any pair of composable arrows @xmath140 one finds : @xmath141 this means that @xmath128 acts linearly on the normal bundle @xmath142 , and one can form the * action groupoid * : @xmath143 the space of arrows of this groupoid is the fiber product @xmath144 , with source and target maps : @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "the product of two composable arrows @xmath147 and @xmath148 is then given by : @xmath149 one then checks that :    the map @xmath150 , @xmath151)$ ] , is an isomorphism of lie groupoids .",
    "finally , let us observe that the restricted groupoid @xmath128 sits ( as the zero section ) inside the lie groupoid @xmath131 as a lie subgroupoid .",
    "this justifies introducing the following definition :    for a saturated submanifold @xmath126 of a lie groupoid @xmath64 the local * linear model * around @xmath126 is the groupoid @xmath131 .    for the submersion groupoid @xmath152 associated with a submersion @xmath0 ,",
