    "although the goal is to remove edges , one can see this as a partition problem , and in fact as a special case of with the cut - capacity function as @xmath11 .",

    "hypergraph multiway partition problem ( ) is the special case of where @xmath11 is the hypergraph - cut function : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the weight of @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the set of all hyperedges that intersect @xmath27 but are not contained in @xmath27 .",
    "the distinction between and is that in the former a hyperedge incurs a cost only once if the vertices in it are split across terminals while in the cost paid by a hyperedge is the number of non - trivial pieces it is partitioned into .",
    "both problems have several applications , in particular for circuit partitioning problems in vlsi design @xcite .",

    "in fact , ( and related generalizations ) were introduced by zhao , nagamochi and ibaraki @xcite partly motivated by the applications to hypergraph cut and partition problems .    a second important motivation to consider and is the following question . to what extent do current algorithms and techniques for important special cases such as and",
    "depend on the fact that the underlying structure is a graph ( or a hypergraph ) ?",
    "or is it the case that submodularity of the cut function the key underlying phenomenon ? for dahlhaus _ et al . _",

    "let @xmath73 be the support of @xmath74 , that is , the set of vertices assigned to @xmath46 for a given @xmath66 .",
    "the reason that @xmath70 may not be a feasible allocation is two - fold .",

    "second , the vertices @xmath76 are unallocated .",
    "we let @xmath77 be the allocated set .",
    "our fundamental insight here is that the expected cost of the unallocated set , that is @xmath78 , can be upper bounded effectively .",
    "we can then assign the set @xmath79 to an arbitrary terminal and use sub - additivity of @xmath11 ( since it is submodular and non - negative ) .",

    "the unallocated set and the expected cost of the initial allocation are some what more complex .",
    "we analyze both these scenarios using the following theorem which is our main result .",

    "we refer to this rounding procedure as _",
    "@xmath66-rounding_. it follows from the definition of the lovsz relaxation that , if we pick @xmath66 uniformly at random from the interval @xmath34 $ ] and we perform @xmath66-rounding , the expected cost of the resulting allocation is equal to the fractional cost .",
    "this observation suggests a very natural algorithm for rounding a solution @xmath48 to : we pick @xmath66 uniformly at random from some interval , and we perform @xmath66-rounding with respect to each terminal ; this gives us a set @xmath84 for each terminal @xmath46 .",
    "the sets @xmath84 might not be an allocation for two reasons : the sets might not be disjoint or their union might not be the entire ground set @xmath0 . we can ensure that we get disjoint sets by either uncrossing the sets @xmath84 if @xmath11 is symmetric or by choosing @xmath66 from the interval @xmath85 $ ] if @xmath11 is not symmetric .",
    "thus we only need to allocate the vertices that are not in the sets @xmath86 ; let @xmath87 denote the set of all vertices that are unallocated .",
    "our main insight is that the unallocated set is not very expensive , and therefore we can simply allocate all of the vertices in @xmath79 to one of the terminals . in the following ,",

    "exploits the geometric aspects further to obtain an improvement in the ratio to @xmath29 . if one views as a special case of then the function @xmath11 under consideration is the cut function .",
    "the cut function @xmath11 can be decomposed into several simple submodular functions , corresponding to the edges , each of which depends only on two vertices .",
    "this allows one to focus on the probability that an edge is cut in the rounding process .",
    "our work in @xcite for and is also in a similar vein since one can visualize and analyze the simple functions that arise from the hypergraph cut function .",

    "it is interesting that the integrality gap of is at most @xmath28 for any symmetric function @xmath11 , matching the bound achieved by @xcite for .",
    "our rounding differs from that in @xcite ; both do @xmath66-rounding but our algorithm uncrosses the sets @xmath73 to make them disjoint while ckr - rounding does it by picking a random permutation .",
    "one can understand the random permutation as an oblivious uncrossing operation that is particularly suited for submodular functions that depend on only two variables ( in this case the edges ) ; it is unclear whether this is suitable for arbitrary symmetric functions .",
    "it is natural to ask whether the ratio of @xmath28 for can be further improved given that the ratio for is @xmath29 .",
    "however the techniques in @xcite are heavily reliant on and tailored to the geometry of the simplex and it seem technically quite challenging to extend the ideas to general symmetric submodular functions .",
