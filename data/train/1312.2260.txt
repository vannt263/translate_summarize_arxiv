    "most of the nuclei heavier than iron are built up via neutron capture reactions in the so - called @xmath11 and @xmath12 processes . however , on the proton - rich side of the valley of stability there are 35 proton - rich nuclei not created by neutron capture processes .",
    "these mostly even - even proton - rich , stable isotopes between @xmath13se and @xmath14hg are the so called @xmath9 nuclei @xcite .",

    "excitation functions of elastic scattering at very backward angles have been measured by three groups @xcite .",
    "numerical data are not available , and all data have to be read from the given figures in @xcite . ref .",
    "@xcite studies only @xmath6cd , and the figure is hard to decipher .",
    "so we restrict ourselves here to the excitation functions in refs .",
    "@xcite : badawy _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have measured excitation functions at the very backward angle of @xmath15 from about 10.5mev to 15.5mev in the c.m .  system .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite show data at @xmath16 from about 9.5mev to 16.5mev . because the rutherford - normalized cross section at very backward angles is almost constant , we present both data sets at @xmath17 @xcite and @xmath18 @xcite in a common figure ( the calculated deviations because of the different angle remain below 1% in the whole energy range shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : exci ] ) .",
    "in addition , we add the most backward data point from our angular distributions which is also at approximately @xmath17 .",
    "as already pointed out in @xcite , it is impossible to derive an optical potential from an excitation function at one particular angle .",
    "instead , it is only possible to determine an approximate strength of the imaginary potential and a so called `` one - point '' potential for the real part .",
    "nevertheless , the excitation functions provide additional information , and global potentials should be able to reproduce the measured excitation functions . in the following",
    "we compare the predictions from the local potentials ( without further adjustment to the experimental data of the excitation function ) and from the global potentials @xcite to the experimental data @xcite .",
    "for @xmath6cd the agreement between the experimental data of @xcite and @xcite is not good ; the data of @xcite are slightly higher than the data of @xcite .",
    "the result from the present analysis of the full angular distribution is a few per cent lower than @xcite .",
    "it must be noted that the above discrepancies may  at least partly  be assigned to the uncertainty of the extraction of the data from figures in @xcite .",
    "the 19mev local potential reproduces the excitation function in general quite well , but slightly overestimates our lower data point at 15.6mev .",
    "the 16mev local potential with the unusual width parameter @xmath19 can be excluded because of its strange energy dependence and the strong overestimation of our 18.8mev data point .",
    "the 16mev local potential with the standard width @xmath20 slightly underestimates the whole excitation function but shows a regular energy dependence ( similar to the 19mev local potential ) .",
    "both global and regional potentials also provide a regular energy dependence ; as already seen in the analysis of the angular distributions in fig .",
    "[ fig : ruth ] , both potentials overestimate the experimental data at backward angles and thus also the excitation functions .",
    "the new potential of @xcite is closer to the data than the old standard potential from mcfadden and satchler @xcite .",
    "for @xmath21cd the data of @xcite and @xcite are in better agreement .",
    "again , our data point at 15.6mev is slightly lower than the excitation function by @xcite .",
    "the theoretical results are very similar to the @xmath6cd case .",
    "again , the 19mev local potential nicely reproduces the data .",
    "the 16mev local potential with the unusual width @xmath22 shows an oscillatory energy dependence which is not visible in the experimental data , and it underestimates the excitation function at very low energies .",
    "the 16mev local potential with @xmath20 reproduces the smooth energy dependence and gives slightly smaller cross sections than the 19mev potential .",
    "both global and regional potentials reproduce again the smooth energy dependence of the data but overestimate the absolute scale .",
    "the new potential of @xcite is again closer to the data than @xcite .",
    "recently , the variation of the elastic scattering cross sections along the sn isotopic chain had been studied by galaviz _",
    "complete angular distributions of the @xmath23sn(@xmath1)@xmath23sn reactions at e@xmath24 = 19.51 mev were measured .",
    "it was found that the ratio of the elastic alpha scattering cross sections of the @xmath7sn and @xmath25sn at backward angles shows an oscillation feature .",
    "it was evident that the global alpha - nucleus potentials failed to reproduce either the amplitude and/or the phase of the oscillation pattern for backward angles @xcite .",
    "this behavior is very similar to the ratio of the rutherford normalized cross sections of the @xmath26mo(@xmath1)@xmath26mo and @xmath27y(@xmath1)@xmath27y derived by kiss _",
    "et al . _ , @xcite .    in the present work , first , the behavior of the elastic alpha scattering cross sections along the cd isotopic ( @xmath28 = 48 ) chain is investigated at e@xmath29 15.6 and 18.8 mev .",
    "although there are small differences in the center - of - mass energies ( @xmath30 120 kev ) , the ratios of the rutherford normalized cross sections are well defined because the dominating 1/e@xmath31 dependence of the scattering cross section is taken into account during rutherford normalization .",
    "therefore , the ratios of rutherford normalized cross sections are a very sensitive test for local , regional and global alpha - nucleus potential parameterizations .",
    "it is found that the ratio of the normalized scattering cross sections shows an oscillation pattern at backward angles ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio_neutron ] ) similarly to the variation of the elastic scattering cross sections along the sn isotopic chain @xcite .",
    "the large number of experimental points and the low uncertainties on all data sets provide a unique probe to understand the evolution of the alpha nucleus potential along the cd isotopic chain .",
    "moreover , the variation of the elastic alpha scattering cross sections along the @xmath32 = 62 isotonic chain is also studied by investigating the ratio of the @xmath6cd(@xmath8,@xmath8)@xmath6cd and @xmath7sn(@xmath8,@xmath8)@xmath7sn reaction cross sections at e@xmath5 18.8 mev ( see fig . [",
    "fig : ratio_proton ] ) .",
    "the @xmath7sn(@xmath8,@xmath8)@xmath7sn is taken from @xcite .",
    "it was found that the ratio of the elastic scattering cross sections along the @xmath32 = 62 isotonic chain shows a similar behavior to the one reported in @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio_neutron ] and [ fig : ratio_proton ] the experimental ratio of the rutherford normalized elastic scattering cross sections is compared to the corresponding results of the regional potential of avrigeanu _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and the global potential of mcfadden and satchler @xcite .",
    "the grey shaded error band is a very conservative estimate which is derived from the total errors ( statistical and systematic , see discussion in sec .",
    "ii ) of the measured cross sections in fig .",
    "[ fig : ruth ] .",
    "if we consider only the statistical uncertainties , it can be clearly seen that the oscillatory patterns in the cross section ratios are well defined by the experimental data .",
    "( note that the systematic uncertainty cancels out in the ratio to a large extent . )",
    "[ fig : ratio_neutron ] and  [ fig : ratio_proton ] show that no regional or global parameterization can describe correctly the amplitude and the phase of the oscillation pattern of the experimental data at backward angles .",
    "this fact clearly indicates that the available theoretical alpha nucleus optical potential parameterizations have to be further improved",
    ".    a closer look at the shown ratios in figs .",
    "[ fig : ratio_neutron ] and [ fig : ratio_proton ] and the underlying cross sections in fig .",
    "[ fig : ruth ] provides deeper insight into the reasons for the failure of the potentials and should lead to suggestions for improvements , in particular for the regional potential by avrigeanu _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite with its careful parameterization of all the parameters of the potential in dependence on the target mass number @xmath33 , charge number @xmath28 , and energy @xmath34 .",
    "it is obvious that the mass- and energy - independent global potential by mcfadden and satchler @xcite does a good job , but improvements within this very limited parameter space are almost impossible .",
    "therefore , the following discussion focuses mainly on the rop potential .",
    "the rop potential is able to reproduce the angular distributions for @xmath35cd almost perfectly , and thus it also reproduces the total reaction cross section @xmath36 for @xmath35cd .",
    "the elastic scattering cross sections of @xmath6cd and @xmath21cd are significantly smaller at backward angles ; this corresponds to a significantly larger @xmath36 .",
    "the increase of @xmath36 with neutron number can be understood easily because of the dominance of the ( @xmath8,n ) reaction channel and its increasing cross section with increasing neutron number .",
    "however , it is surprising that there is a strong change from @xmath35cd to @xmath6cd and only a much smaller change from @xmath6cd to @xmath21cd : the ratio of elastic scattering cross sections at backward angles is about 1.5 for @xmath35cd/@xmath6cd whereas it is only about 1.25 for @xmath6cd/@xmath21cd . any global potential with a smooth mass dependence like e.g.  @xcite or missing mass dependence",
    "@xcite will fail to reproduce the cross section ratios in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio_neutron ] ; the calculated ratios are about 1.1 in all cases and smaller than the experimental results .",
    "the apparently different behavior of @xmath35cd may be understood from a weak subshell closure of the @xmath37 neutron shell at @xmath38 .",
    "although one textbook reference of the shell model @xcite shows in its fig .  1 that the @xmath39 subshell is slightly lower than the @xmath37 subshell ( and thus one should find a subshell closure at @xmath40 instead of @xmath41 ) , there is some evidence from the ground state spins of @xmath42 for neighboring @xmath43 nuclei like @xmath44pd , @xmath45cd , @xmath46sn that the @xmath37 neutron subshell is filled at @xmath41 .",
    "note that the lowering of the @xmath37 subshell below the @xmath39 subshell is well - established for the proton subshells @xcite .",
    "this weak subshell closure may explain the relatively small total reaction cross section of @xmath35cd .",
    "the experimental ratio of elastic scattering cross sections at backward angles is about 0.5 between @xmath6cd and @xmath7sn .",
    "again , this can be understood , but the argument is different : the neutron numbers are the same for @xmath6cd and @xmath7sn and can not have strong impact on the ( @xmath8,n ) or total reaction cross section .",
    "however , @xmath7sn is a semi - magic nucleus with @xmath47 , and thus the total reaction cross section @xmath36 is smaller compared to neighboring nuclei , and the elastic scattering cross section is larger .",
    "again , such a behavior can not be reproduced by any potential with a smooth ( or even missing ) mass dependence .",
    "this leads to the following recommendations for improvements .",
    "in addition to a smooth dependence on the mass number @xmath33 and charge number @xmath28 , a further dependence on shell closures ( e.g.  parametrized by the distance to a closed shell ) should be included in global parameterizations of @xmath8-nucleus potentials .",
    "this may be complemented by a further dependence of the neutron - to - proton ratio @xmath48 .",
    "the above recommendation may be also interpreted as a guide to the experimentalist for further experiments on non - magic nuclei .",
    "note that only very few data on non - magic nuclei have entered into the determination of the global potential @xcite above @xmath49 ( see their table 2 ) ; this may also explain that @xcite nicely reproduce the data for the semi - magic @xmath7sn but is not able to describe the data for the non - magic @xmath0cd with the same accuracy .",
    "in the present work angular distributions of elastically scattered alpha particles on @xmath0cd have been measured at e@xmath24 = 16.14 mev and 19.46 mev to provide a sensitive test for global parameterizations of the @xmath8-nucleus potential used in @xmath9 process network calculations .",
    "the measured data cover the full angular range and have small uncertainties of about @xmath50% over the whole angular range .",
    "a local fit to the angular distributions using a folding potential in the real part and a surface woods - saxon imaginary part reproduces all measured angular distributions with high accuracy ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "the volume integrals are slightly higher than for neighboring semi - magic nuclei .",
    "the best - fit potential at 16mev shows an unusual width parameter for @xmath6cd and @xmath21cd and does not describe the measured excitation functions at backward angles .",
    "very similar fits ( also with @xmath51 ) can be obtained using the standard width @xmath52 .",
    "the regional and global potentials by @xcite and @xcite are able to describe the angular distributions with relatively small deviations although both global potentials overestimate the data at backward angles . in all cases",
    "the new potential by @xcite is closer to the experimental data than the potential of @xcite .",
    "the same conclusion is found for the excitation functions at backward angles which are available from literature @xcite .",
    "however , the situation becomes worse for the evolution of the potentials along isotopic and isotonic chains .",
    "the measured ratio of cross sections can not be reproduced by any regional and global potential because the deviations at backward angles are amplified in the ratios .",
    "a reason for this problem may be the influence of shell closures which are not taken into account in the parameterizations of @xcite or @xcite .",
    "since modeling explosive nucleosynthesis scenarios requires reaction rates on large number of reactions involving thousands of nuclei , the @xmath8-nucleus potential has to be known in a wide region .",
    "the reliability of the extrapolation to unstable nuclei has to be tested by measuring the elastic scattering cross sections on several nuclei along isotopic and isotonic chains .",
    "the ratio of rutherford normalized cross sections along isotopic or isotonic chains is a very sensitive observable for the quality of @xmath8-nucleus potentials , and it should be used in further work to restrict global parameterizations of @xmath8-nucleus potentials .",
    "further systematic experimental elastic alpha scattering studies at energies around the coulomb barrier are essential , in particular on intermediate mass and heavy nuclei without shell closures .",
    "the experimental scattering data should be complemented by data on @xmath8-induced reaction cross sections in the same energy region . scattering and reaction data",
    "have to enter into theoretical studies leading eventually to a robust global @xmath8-nucleus potential which is able to describe all observables with reasonable accuracy .",

    "<S> moreover , the variation of the elastic alpha scattering cross sections along the @xmath2 isotopic and @xmath3 isotonic chain is investigated by the study of the ratios of the of @xmath4cd(@xmath1)@xmath4cd scattering cross sections at e@xmath5 15.6 and 18.8 mev and the ratio of the @xmath6cd(@xmath1)@xmath6cd and @xmath7sn(@xmath1)@xmath7sn reaction cross sections at e@xmath5 18.8 mev , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these ratios are sensitive probes for the alpha - nucleus optical potential parameterizations . </S>",
    "<S> the potentials under study are a basic prerequisite for the prediction of @xmath8-induced reaction cross sections , e.g.  for the calculation of stellar reaction rates in the astrophysical @xmath9- or @xmath10-process . </S>"
