    "within the last decade we have witnessed a very significant progress in experimental gravitational wave ( gw ) astronomy .",
    "all the ground - based interferometric gw antennae such as ligo @xcite in the usa , virgo @xcite in italy , geo600 @xcite in germany and tama300 @xcite in japan have been commissioned to operation and started to record scientific data .",
    "nevertheless , no signs of gravitational waves were found thus far in this data which is , as we understand now , quite reasonable as it agrees with moderately optimistic predictions of the astrophysicists on the rate of measurable events within the limits of antennae detection range .",
    "this possibility was realized by gw community , and work on design of the next , second generation of gw antennae went on in parallel with efforts in enhancement of the first generation ones . a pioneer amongst the second generation gw detectors will become an american advanced ligo project whose construction should start in 2010 @xcite .",
    "it is planned to have sensitivity more than an order of magnitude higher than its predecessor .",
    "such a dramatic increase will be provided by significantly lower seismic noise level due to new active antiseismic isolation , use of higher quality optics and lower level of quantum noise .",
    "the main difference between the initial ligo and advanced ligo designs that is crucial for lowering this noise is the use of _ signal recycling _ ( sr ) technique .",
    "its implementation in contemporary detector setup is relatively easy as it requires to install only one additional mirror in the interferometer output port .",
    "this mirror reflects sideband signal field coming out of the interferometer back to the arm cavities or `` recycles '' it .",
    "however , the dynamics and quantum noise properties of the interferometer become much richer and thus provide more freedom in adjustment its sensitivity curve to fit the current research goals . in particular , it was stressed by a.  buonnano and y.  chen @xcite that the optical system composed of the sr cavity and the arm cavities forms a composite resonant cavity whose eigenfrequencies and quality factors can be controlled by the position and reflectivity of the sr mirror , thus increasing or decreasing the storage time of the signal inside the cavity . moreover , as in advanced ligo it is planned to increase the optical power , circulating in the arm cavities approximately 80 times with respect to initial ligo , an optomechanical interaction between laser field and mirrors will significantly influence the dynamics of the test masses turning them from free bodies ( within the detection frequency band : @xmath1 hz ) into oscillators with eigenfrequency falling into the detection band .",
    "this effect , known as ponderomotive rigidity @xcite arises when off - resonant optical field creates an effective restoring force originating from radiation pressure , which occurs to be a function of mirror displacement . in this situation one can say that optical field creates a frequency dependent mechanical rigidity @xcite .    as a result",
    ", the quantum noise spectral density of signal recycled interferometers ( sri ) can be tuned to provide the best sensitivity for different gravitational wave sources .",
    "so far , it was supposed that in order to reach good sensitivity for each of the source types , totally different strategies should be used , which correspond to different optical parameters sets .",
    "detection of gravitational waves from inspiraling neutron star binaries ( nsns ) requires , for example , that the noise spectral density have to be as small as possible at low and medium frequencies , @xmath2 .",
    "if one is interested in narrow - band detection of gws from the source with well defined center frequency @xmath3 , such as high frequency pulsars , the optimal regime of the interferometer will be absolutely different : evidently , one should choose such set of optical parameters that provides minimum to noise at @xmath3 .",
    "searches of gws from supernovae bursts or stochastic relic gravitational radiation which analytical waveforms are not known require flat broadband noise curves @xcite .     for bursts of gw radiation as a function of relative deterioration in snr for neutron stars ( ns ) binaries @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath5 is the value of snr for gw burst sources when interferometer is tuned for reaching maximum snr for ns binaries . ]     for one of the high frequency pulsars ( j0034 - 0534 with rotational frequency @xmath6",
    "hz ) as a function of relative deterioration in snr for neutron stars ( ns ) binaries @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath7 is the value of snr for gws from specified pulsar when interferometer is tuned for reaching maximum snr for ns binaries .",
    "]    extensive studies of optimal modes of operation of advanced ligo interferometer most suitable for different specific kinds of sources of gws were carried out in advligo lab in extensive details @xcite .",
    "however , in this paper we focus on finding multipurpose regimes of signal recycled interferometers which might provide good ( sub - optimal ) sensitivity simultaneously for different gravitational wave source types . the possibility to do this originates from the fact that classical noise budget for currently operating and future gw detectors masks low and medium frequency features of the quantum noise ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) that are mostly susceptible to variation of optical parameters of the interferometer .",
    "this fact , although being quite unpleasant for tunability of gw detector for specific sources is surprisingly advantageous for tuning the antenna to have high enough sensitivity to gws from various types of astrophysical sources _ simultaneously_. as will be shown in subsequent sections the sensitivity changes relatively slowly within quite a wide range of main sri optical parameters for different types of signals ( gws from inspiraling compact binaries , gw bursts , high - frequency pulsars etc . ) . and",
    "these areas for different sources significantly overlap that allows to find quasi - optimal regime for two or even three different gw sources simultaneously .",
    "it is shown by the example of advanced ligo sri that rather significant improvement in sensitivity to gw bursts and gws from high frequency sources is possible at the cost of quite moderate deterioration of signal strength for compact binary systems .",
    "this is illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig0a ]  and  [ fig0b ] where the relative improvement in signal - to - noise - ratio ( snr ) for gw bursts and high frequency pulsars , correspondingly , are plotted with respect to relative deterioration of snr for nsns , provided that one diverts optical parameters of sri from the optimal ones for nsns .",
    "it should be also emphasized here that in spite advanced ligo is used as an example for which we perform calculations , the results we obtain are general and applicable to all sri limited by classical noise at low and medium frequencies .",
    "it is also instructive to mention that our optimization includes only the most basic parameters and the results can be considered only as some preliminary guidelines for designing future generation of gw interferometers , while for more specific optimization of real device much larger parameter space should be considered and optimization over parameters that should be set before the device is built and the ones , that can be easily tuned in already operating detector should be performed separately .",
    "the above issues will be considered in future works .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec1 ] the brief consideration of quantum noise of signal - recycled fabry - prot",
    " michelson interferometer is performed . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "expressions for signal - to - noise ratio and detection range for the gravitational - wave radiation from the inspiraling binary system are given and the numerical optimization procedure with respect to interferometer optical parameters is described . the quantitative and qualitative analysis of the obtained results of optimization against gws from neutron star binaries is performed . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "the sensitivity of interferometer to gw bursts is analyzed and regimes for simultaneous detection of these two types of sources are investigated . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "this analysis extended also to high - frequency quasi - periodic sources ( pulsars ) . in section [ conc ]",
    "the obtained results are discussed and some concluding remarks are given .",

    "the next type of possible gw sources are supernovae explosions and stellar cores collapses , compact binary systems mergers @xcite and other sources with not well modeled properties which are usually called gw bursts @xcite . for these sources",
    ", we use the simple model of logarithmic - flat signal spectrum over the range of frequencies from @xmath8 to @xmath9 . by logarithmic - flat spectrum",
    "we mean that spectrum of gw signal @xmath10 is proportional to @xmath11 , that corresponds to constant numerator in expression for snr if integration is performed with respect to @xmath12 : @xmath13 this way of defining snr for burst events seems reasonable to characterize astrophysical signals with unknown spectrum structure so that contributions from frequency ( time ) ranges of different order are equal ( for example , contributions from @xmath14  hz and @xmath15  hz should be the same ) .     as a function of @xmath16 .",

    "[ tab5.5 ] )  to typical suboptimal tunings shown in fig.[fig5.5 ] , point `` o ''  to double ( nsns+bursts ) optimal regime , and points `` p'',``q'',``r ''  to triple ( nsns+bursts+pulsar ) suboptimal regimes . ]    in fig.[fig5 ] , function @xmath17 , calculated using the same algorithm as in the previous ( nsns ) case , and normalized by its maximal value @xmath18 , is shown .",
    "similar to the previous case , in fig.[fig5.5 ] quantum noise spectral densities for the optimal parameters set ( point `` max '' in fig.[fig5 ] and for 4 sub - optimal ones ( points `` a''``d '' ) are plotted , and parameters values for the point `` max '' are listed in table[tab4.5 ] .    ) and four typical sub - optimal spectral densities ( points `` a''``d '' in fig.[fig5 ] with parameters given in table .",
    "[ tab5.5 ] ) . ]",
    "it follows from fig.[fig5 ] , that function @xmath17 also has flat behavior within almost the same range of @xmath19 , @xmath20 as @xmath21 .",
    "the main difference between the nsns and burst cases , invisible in figs.[fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] , stems from the existence of cut - off frequency ( [ f_max ] ) and from more steep frequency dependence of the nsns signal . as a result",
    ", the nsns optimization procedure leads to smaller values of angle @xmath22 , that reduces quantum noise at low frequencies , while the optimization with respect to gw bursts requires smaller values of @xmath23 that reduces quantum noise at high frequencies ( compare figs.[fig4.5 ] , [ fig5.5 ] and the corresponding columns in table [ fig4.5 ] ) .",
    "however , this difference is quite subtle , and it is evident that regimes have to exist which provide good sensitivity for both these types of gw sources simultaneously . in order to find them ,",
    "we calculate values of @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath23 , which maximize the combined normalized sensitivity @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a lagrange multiplier which varies in the range @xmath26 $ ] .    the result is shown in fig.[fig : nsns_burst ] , where parametric plot of @xmath27 against @xmath28 is presented .",
    "the leftmost point on this plot corresponds to @xmath29 , and the rightmost one  to @xmath30 .",
    "it follows from this calculation , that the tuning exists where values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 decrease both only by @xmath33 compared to their maximal values : @xmath34 the corresponding values of parameters @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath23 are listed in the column `` o '' of table[tab4.5 ] .",
    "this point on the plane \\{@xmath19 , @xmath20 } , marked as `` o '' , is shown also in plots [ fig4 ] , [ fig5 ] .     against @xmath28 ]    in fig.[fig:995 ] the plot of quantum noise spectral density for this regime is presented together with plots of previously calculated optimal spectral densities for nsns and burst sources .",

    "high frequency periodical sources of gws , namely millisecond pulsars , can be treated as very narrow - band almost monochromatic sources with well defined central frequency @xmath37 @xcite . for these sources ,",
    "the detection range and the snr are simply proportional to inverted square root of the noise spectral density at given frequency @xmath37 , @xmath38 direct optimization of quantum noise in this case gives spectral density with very narrow and deep minimum at frequency @xmath37 , which is evidently non - optimal for the nsns and burst sources considered above . moreover",
    ", technical noise makes it useless to have very deep minima in quantum noise spectral density , limiting @xmath39 by the value of @xmath40    therefore , we optimize the following `` triple - purpose '' function : @xmath41^{-1 } \\!\\!\\!,\\ ] ] where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are lagrange multipliers .",
    "we took pulsar j0034 - 0534 @xcite as an example of millisecond pulsars , presumably emitting narrow - band high frequency gws .",
    "its barycentric rotational frequency is equal to @xmath44 and frequency of emitted gws should be then @xmath45 . among the high - frequency pulsars ,",
    "the distance to this one is significantly smaller compared to other ones ( @xmath46 ) and therefore is one of the most probable candidates for gw detection .",

    "it follows from these plots , that despite of two - dimensional character ( two lagrange parameters @xmath25 and @xmath51 ) of the optimization procedure , the results are virtually one - dimensional , because only very small trade - off between values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 is possible ( lines in both planes of fig.[fig : sco ] almost coincide ) .        in fig.[fig :",
    "nsns_sco ] quantum noises for four characteristic regimes with optimal @xmath52 are plotted .",
    "these plots demonstate how the optimization algorithm increases the sensitivity at the given frequency @xmath37 .",
    "the starting point `` o '' corresponds to obtained in sec.[sec4 ] parameters set , optimized for nsns and bursts signals , see figs.[fig4 ] , [ fig5 ] .",
    "first , the optimization algorithm tries to suppress the quantum noise in all high - frequency range ( @xmath53 ) by increasing @xmath19 and decreasing @xmath20 , see point `` p '' in these plots . at this stage ,",
    "noticeable gain in pulsars sensitivity ( @xmath54 ) can be obtained with negligibly small ( @xmath55 ) sensitivity loss for nsns and bursts sources ( see table[tab4.5 ] ) .",
    "then , the optimization algorithm starts to `` grow '' local minimum at frequency @xmath37 , by increasing back @xmath20 in such a way that @xmath56 , see points `` q '' and `` r '' . at this stage @xmath31 and @xmath32",
    "start to decrease noticeably ( by tens of percents ) .",
    "however , @xmath39 increases several times at this stage .",
    "the results of this paper rely heavily on the estimates of the technical noise predicted for advanced ligo .",
    "these estimates almost definitely will be subject to changes during the next few years , however , it is improbable that technical noise estimates will change _ significantly_. therefore , all specific values obtained here should not be considered as final ones .",
    "the main result of this paper is not these values , but the conclusion that regimes of the signal - recycled interferometer exist which can provide good sensitivity for both binary inspiraling and burst gravitational wave sources .",
    "moreover , `` triple - purposes '' regimes are also possible , which provide significant sensitivity gain for high - frequency periodical sources ( millisecond pulsar ) with only minor sensitivity degradation for binary inspiraling and bursts gw sources",
    ".    calculations presented in this paper show that in order to obtain good sensitivity for binary , burst and , to some extent , high - frequency periodic sources , it is necessary to use large values of interferometer bandwidth @xmath57 with significant positive detunings @xmath58 , see table[tab4.5 ] .",
    "these tunings give smooth broadband shape of quantum noise curves , dictated by the technical noises , especially by the mirrors thermal noise which has very flat frequency dependence in gw signals spectral range .",
