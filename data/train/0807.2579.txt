    "the present era of precision flavour physics may turn soon due to the excellent performance of the @xmath7-factories and tevatron ( and hopefully lhc ) into an era of precision flavour * new * physics .",
    "rare @xmath8 transitions in several inclusive and exclusive modes start exhibiting some tension with the sm predictions@xcite .",
    "indeed , there is certain theoretical prejudist@xcite to expect deviations in @xmath8 transitions and sm - like results in the corresponding @xmath9 ones .    in order to reach",
    "the accuracy needed in some @xmath7 decay processes to get to the discovery level it is of an utmost importance to refine the me - thods used to predict those decays .",
    "there are two main approaches in the literature : @xmath10-expansion based methods , namely , qcd factorization ( qcdf)@xcite , soft collinear effective theories @xcite or pqcd@xcite and flavour symmetry methods like u - spin @xcite . here",
    "i will discuss a new method @xcite that combines the predictive power of qcdf techniques with the model - independence of flavour symmetries .",
    "moreover , a main advantage of this method is that it reduces substantially the sensitivity to the dangerous chirally enhanced ir divergences in qcdf and the arbitrariness in the choice of the size of su(3 ) breaking in flavour symmetries .    before briefly discussing the method and its application to decays of @xmath7 mesons into vectors @xcite to extract the weak mixing angle @xmath0 , i will open a parenthesis to comment on the results of the measurement of the @xmath11 decay . here",
    "i will focus on certain observables that were proposed in @xcite .",
    "recently , babar has found a set of very interesting results @xcite while measuring observables based on the @xmath12 channel , namely : i ) longitudinal polarization fraction of the @xmath13 : @xmath14 , ii ) forward - backward asymmetry : @xmath15 , iii ) isospin asymmetry @xmath16 of @xmath17 and @xmath18 channels and soon iv ) the transverse asymmetry : @xmath19 .",
    "i will discuss them in turn and comment on the impact of two scenarios ( flipped sign solution for @xmath20 ) and right handed currents ( rh ) scenario ( @xmath21 ) . even if , at a first sight , the flipped sign scenario ( not my favorite one ) may appear as a possible solution for all these deviations , indeed it is not a completely satisfactory solution . moreover ,",
    "this scenario is somehow disfavoured ( under certain assumptions ) by the inclusive mode , but not ruled out .",
    "of course , this should be taken only as an exercise , since data should still give the final answer and , other scenarios may led to a better explanation if data changes substantially .",
    "* @xmath22 @xcite , where @xmath23 are , respectively , the longitudinal , perpendicular and parallel spin amplitude of the @xmath13 .",
    "the theoretical prediction for this observable was computed in qcdf at nlo in @xcite and including possible @xmath24 corrections of order 10% in each amplitude in @xcite . from @xcite",
    "( see fig.1 ) one gets an average value ( weighted by the distribution @xmath25 ) in the region @xmath26 of @xmath27 ( @xmath28 was taken 0.35 ) .",
    "an update of this calculation has been done in @xcite with an average value @xmath29 slightly higher due to the different choice in @xcite for @xmath30 .",
    "recently an experimental averaged value of @xmath31 @xcite was measured on a larger region @xmath32 . +     +    + even if these two numbers can not be yet compared , it is presumable that the averaged experimental value once taken in the @xmath26 region will certainly increase but still probably will remain a low value .",
    "( one can do the opposite exercise and compute the theory average from @xmath33 to @xmath34 , not taken into account possible low resonances effects obtaining @xmath35 .",
    "of course , this number should be taken _ only _ as an indication ) .",
    "let me now discuss the impact of the two scenarios : first , it was found in @xcite that supersymmetry with non - minimal flavour violation in the down sector , as an example of rh current contribution ( @xmath36 ) do not deviate much from the sm region ( fig.1 ) . indeed , beyond the supersymmetric case , picking up some extreme but allowed values of",
    "@xmath37 one finds that it is hard to go down more than a 10% with respect to the sm band .",
    "the other scenario , the flipped sign solution for @xmath20 deviate more substantially@xcite ( see fig.1 ) from the sm region and in the direction of the measured valued .",
    "* @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "the forward - backward asymmetry , is particularly interesting on its zero , where form factors drop at leading order giving a precise relation between @xmath20 and @xmath39 , but also due to its sensitivity to the sign of @xmath20 .",
    "experimentally , it was found ( fig.2 ) again a deviation that tend to prefer the reversed sign of @xmath20 .",
    "an scenario compatible with this situation was discussed in @xcite in the case of mssm with large @xmath40 ( see fig.2 ) . again for this observable , like in the case of @xmath14 , rh currents originating from a supersymmetric model do not seem to deviate substantially from the sm prediction . * @xmath41}/{ds } - { d\\gamma[b^\\pm\\to   k^{\\ast\\pm}\\ell^+ \\ell^-]}/{ds } } { { d\\gamma [ b^0\\to k^{\\ast0}\\ell^+ \\ell^-]}/{ds } + { d\\gamma[b^\\pm \\to   k^{\\ast\\pm}\\ell^+ \\ell^-]}/{ds } } \\label{dai } $ ] @xcite .",
    "this asymmetry in the sm arises from graphs where a photon is radiated from the spectator quark in annihilation or spectator - scattering diagrams .",
    "the sensitivity to the different charge of the spectator quark for a @xmath42 or a @xmath43 induces a non - zero value .",
    "the computation of this isospin asymmetry for @xmath12 in the framework of qcdf was done in @xcite .",
    "it was found there that for values of @xmath44 no sizeable isospin asymmetry is expected in the sm ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "the case of @xmath45 was computed in @xcite . in the limit @xmath46 ,",
    "where the photon pole dominates , our isospin asymmetry reduces to @xmath47 ( in agreement with @xcite ) .",
    "it is remarkable the good agreement with the sm prediction and the experiment at this point and this is puzzling .",
    "the @xmath45 solution is also sensitive to the sign of @xmath48 , although relative to the sign of @xmath49 . on the contrary , for larger values of @xmath50",
    "the isospin asymmetry is dominated by the longitudinal polarization amplitude and the dominant operators are @xmath51 .",
    "so even if one may devise a solution to accommodate sm at @xmath45 and beyond sm at @xmath44 any solution looks a bit unnatural .",
    "remarkably again it is where the longitudinal polarization dominates where it was found experimentally ( fig.3 ) a deviation from the sm prediction . barring the @xmath45 problem , in @xcite it was found that for the scenario of mssm with large @xmath52 the flipped sign solution of @xmath20 induces negative values for the isospin asymmetry ( fig.3 ) , pointing towards the experimental result , although still far from the measured value .",
    "* @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "this last observable , still not measured could provide an important piece of the puzzle .",
    "this is an observable constructed to minimize theoretical uncertainties and show a maximal sensitivity to the presence of rh currents .",
    "if all the impact of new physics consist on flipping the sign of @xmath20 one should not see any deviation from the sm prediction in @xmath54 . on the contrary , if it deviates , the presence of rh currents would be favored ( with or without flipped @xmath20 ) .    to conclude",
    ", we observe that the solution with the flipped sign of @xmath20 seems to go in the right direction ( but it is still not sufficient ) to explain the preliminary observed deviations .",
    "however , it has two important caveats : it is disfavoured by the inclusive mode and , moreover , it may require a weird solution to avoid conflicts with @xmath16 at @xmath45 .",
    "rh current solution ( @xmath55 ) seems not to deviate enough from sm prediction for @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( @xmath19 may help to favour or rule out this solution ) .",
    "second , observables containing the longitudinal polarization ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) seems to systematically exhibit deviations ( consistently with this remark one would expect that @xmath19 , like @xmath16 at @xmath45 will not deviate ) . in this sense",
    ", the new longitudinal observables proposed in @xcite may play an important role .",
    "finally , it will be very interesting to see the comparison between theory and experiment strictly inside the theoretically well controlled region @xmath56 .",
    "this closes the parenthesis .",

    "one of the main source of uncertainties in qcdf comes from ir divergences originating from :    @xmath57 hard spectator - scattering : hard gluons exchange between spectator quark and the outgoing energetic meson gives rise to integrals of the following type ( see @xcite for definitions ) : @xmath58 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the second term ( formally of order @xmath24 ) diverges when @xmath59 .",

    "these divergences are the main source of error in qcdf . if one splits the sm amplitude for a @xmath7-decay into two mesons in two pieces : @xmath64 with @xmath65 denoting the charge of the decay products , and",
    "@xmath66 s the products of ckm factors @xmath67 , one observes that for certain processes the structure of the ir divergences at nlo in qcdf is the same for both pieces .",
    "this allows to identify an ir safe quantity * at this order * , defined by @xmath68 that can be evaluated safely in qcdf and that will be taken as the main input from qcdf .",
    "another important remark is that this quantity can be directly related to observables leading to a set of sum rules that can be translated into predictions for the ut angles@xcite ( see strategy 2 in sec.3.1 ) . in @xcite",
    "this idea was extended to vector - vector final states . in this case , there is a @xmath69 associated to each helicity amplitude .",
    "but we focus on the leading ( in a naive power counting in @xmath24 ) longitudinal one .",
    "we obtain for the longitudinal @xmath69 of the @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) decay denoted by @xmath72 ( @xmath73)@xcite : @xmath74 are the usual penguin functions and @xmath75 are the naive factorization factors .",
    "the corresponding @xmath69 s for the other modes can be found in @xcite .    in short",
    "the method consist in relating the hadronic complex parameters @xmath76 , @xmath77 that describes the dynamics of a @xmath8 governed transition with the corresponding parameters of an u - spin @xmath9 related process .",
    "this requires to include su(3 ) breaking factorizable ( @xmath78 ) and non - factorizable u - spin breaking @xmath10 suppressed corrections .",
    "those non - factorizable corrections are sensitive to the different distribution amplitude of a @xmath79 and @xmath1 and spectator quark dependent contributions coming from gluons emitted from a @xmath80 or @xmath81 quark . the next step is to determine the complex hadronic parameters of the @xmath9 related decay @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",
    "this is done using the data on br and direct cp asymmetry of the @xmath9 decay and its associated @xmath84 computed in qcdf .",
    "recent controversial claims on evidence of new physics in the weak mixing phase @xmath0 @xcite has focused the attention into this mixing phase . here",
    "i will describe three possible strategies to measure this phase using @xmath7 mesons decaying into vectors that were discussed in @xcite .",
    "we will focus on the golden mode @xmath89 which can be easily reconstructed from the decays of the @xmath90 into kaons and pions .",
    "_ : _ it applies to @xmath89 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 decays .",
    "this strategy requires to measure the longitudinal br and mixing - induced cp asymmetry of those modes and compute its corresponding @xmath68 ( see eq.[equdeltas ] ) from qcdf .",
    "expanding the longitudinal mixing - induced cp asymmetry in power of @xmath93 one obtains : @xmath94 with @xmath95 in order to evaluate the size of the @xmath96 pollution , one must constrain the size of @xmath97 and translate these constrains into bounds on @xmath96 .",
    "these bounds can be found in @xcite . the steps to follow are : first",
    ", one measures the longitudinal @xmath98 , second , for each value of this br and using the bounds on @xmath97 one obtains a possible range for @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "finally , once measured @xmath100 of this decay mode one can then determine a range for @xmath101 from : @xmath102 if this range is inconsistent with the predicted sm value for @xmath0 that would signal the presence of new physics .",
    "the great advantage of this strategy is that by measuring the longitudinal branching ratio , and the direct and mixing induced cp asymmetry of a @xmath1 meson decaying through a @xmath9 or @xmath8 process one gets a direct determination of the weak mixing angle @xmath0 with only * one * single theoretical input : the corresponding @xmath69 of the process .",
    "even more , the precise way the asymmetries enter into this expression tells you that a measurement of the branching ratio and the untagged rate is enough to determine @xmath107 but also @xmath108 .",
    "this can be seen explicitly in the expressions@xcite : @xmath109 @xmath110 where @xmath111 verifies @xmath112 .",
    "this extraction of @xmath107 is done in this strategy under the assumption that there is no significant new physics affecting the @xmath8 decay .",
    "this strategy has the advantage of minimizing the theoretical input , but it requires to measure several of the @xmath1 observables .    _ _ : this last strategy is the most theoretically driven .",
    "it focus only on the golden mode @xmath89 and assumes no sizeable new physics in the @xmath113 u - spin related decay . the steps to follow here are the same that were done for @xmath114 decays .",
    "first , one has to relate the hadronic parameters of both processes : @xmath115 @xmath116 computing factorizable @xmath117 and non - factorizable su(3 ) breaking parameters : @xmath118        then using as main inputs the @xmath119 , @xmath120 together with the longitudinal direct cp asymmetry of @xmath113 one obtains a prediction in the sm for the corresponding @xmath1 observables : @xmath121 finally a measurement of the longitudinal mixing induced cp asymmetry of @xmath89 allow to extract the weak mixing angle @xmath0 including all penguin pollution .",
    "figure 5 shows the correlation between @xmath100 and @xmath0 .",
    "the extraction of @xmath0 from this plot is possible even in the presence of new physics under the condition that there are only new physics contributions in @xmath122 but not large new physics effects in @xmath123 fcnc amplitudes .",
    "this requirement can be easily accomplished for generic type of new physics models if two conditions are fulfilled ( see @xcite ) : i ) @xmath124 and ii ) the effective coupling in @xmath122 can be expressed as the square of the effective coupling in @xmath123 amplitudes .",
    "these conditions can be easily understood using an effective lagrangian language@xcite .",
    "_ summary : _ three different strategies to extract the weak mixing phase @xmath0 from @xmath2 were presented . also the recent results on the @xmath125 decay",
