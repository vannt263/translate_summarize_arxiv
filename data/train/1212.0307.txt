    "galactic extinction is the most fundamental correction that should be applied to virtually all astronomical data .",
    "the most widely used map for the purpose is constructed by schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ; hereafter , sfd ) .",
    "they first made dust temperature and emissivity maps ( @xmath5 fwhm spatial resolution ) from cobe / dirbe data at @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "then a finer resolution map was created for dust emission ( @xmath8 fwhm angular resolution ) from iras / issa data at @xmath6 using the cobe temperature map as a calibrator .",
    "finally they constructed the maps of reddening and extinction assuming a simple linear relation between far infrared ( fir ) flux at 100@xmath9 and dust column density with a temperature correction for dust emissivity .",
    "as is clear from their construction procedure , the sfd map _ does not _ correspond to absorption - weighted , as required for most purposed in astronomy , but is an emission - weighted dust extinction map .",
    "this motivated yahata et al.(2007 ; hereafter y07 ) to examine the validity of the assumed proportionality between extinction and emissivity using the surface density of sdss @xcite galaxies in a given apparent magnitude range as a calibrator .",
    "surprisingly , y07 found that the galaxy surface densities _ increase _ against the value of the extinction @xmath10 for low extinction regions ( @xmath11 ) ; see their figure 4 .",
    "after several careful analyses , they concluded that this anomaly originates from the far infrared ( fir ) emission from the sdss galaxies themselves . if such additional fir emissions from extra - galactic objects are incorrectly interpreted as those from the galactic dust , the extinction of those regions is overestimated .",
    "the amount of the fir emission would be an increasing function of the surface number density of galaxies , and the correlation between them should be visible especially where the galactic extinction is small .",
    "moreover the correlation should become even stronger after correction using the contaminated extinction value .    although the proposal of y07 for the origin of the anomaly is reasonable ,",
    "it is admittedly based on indirect and circumstantial evidence . in the present",
    "_ paper _ , we report on a detection of fir emission signatures from sdss galaxies and quasars through a stacking analysis of the sfd map .",
    "the amount of the fir emission from those objects is statistically consistent with that required to explain the anomaly discovered by y07 .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows ; in  2 we describe part of the sdss dr7 data catalog that we use in the analysis . after presenting the stacking analysis method",
    ", we show the stacked images and the resulting fit to the analytical profile .",
    "section 3 discusses the physical interpretation of the extracted parameters for fir emission from sdss galaxies and comparison with the cross - correlation with iras pscz catalog .",
    "we also repeat the similar stacking analysis for sdss dr6 photometric quasars in section 4 .",
    "section 5 summarizes the conclusions . finally in appendix",
    "we show the iras point spread function that we measure .",
    "in the following analysis , we use the sdss dr7 photometric galaxy catalog , which covers 11663 @xmath12 of sky area , with photometry in five passbands ; @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath1 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 ( for more details of the photometric data , see @xcite ) . according to photometry processing flags",
    ", we carefully remove bad photometry data and fast - moving objects , which are likely in the solar system or associated with the interplanetary dust .",
    "we also exclude objects in masked regions to avoid unreliable photometry data . for more details of our data selection , see @xcite .",
    "our analysis below does not exclude the galaxies that are also detected by iras pscz ( @xcite ; see  3 ) that are removed in the sfd map .",
    "we made sure that this has a negligibly small effect on our result because of the small number of overlapped galaxies .",
    "as discussed by y07 , the amount of fir emission from sdss galaxies that explains the anomaly is very small , and it is impossible to detect for individual galaxies .",
    "therefore we stack those regions of the sfd map centered at the positions of sdss photometric galaxies ( in this section ) or quasars ( in appendix ) over their appropriate magnitude bins . for that purpose ,",
    "we use a contiguous region in the sdss dr7 photometric catalog as shown in figure [ fig : region - sfdmap ] .",

    "the fact that the value of @xmath30 is also sensitive to the region of the map and the weaker @xmath26-dependence in this case may imply that this is due to a subtle selection criterion difference of sdss photometric galaxies as a function of the galactic extinction itself , including the star - galaxy separation in different area , for instance .",
    "we do not investigate this issue in the present paper since our main finding is unlikely affected by the position dependent value of the background noise term .",

    "we found that this is simply due to the fact the total signal is dominated by the clustering term ; the unambiguous extraction of the single galaxy contribution in those cases is difficult if we add another degree of freedom in @xmath42 for each magnitude bin . in the case of @xmath74 ,",

    "we note here that the correction is not limited to sdss galaxies at all , and can be directly applied to future galaxy surveys as long as the @xmath1-band magnitude of galaxies is measured .",
    "this is because the dominant clustering term is contributed by galaxies that are not even resolved or identified in the sdss galaxy catalog .",

    "thus estimated ratios are plotted in figure [ fig : fir - rband - ratio ] .",
    "the fact that the ratio for a single galaxy is approximately constant indicates that the statistically averaged ratio of fir and optical luminosities of galaxies are independent of the @xmath1-band magnitude , which is very reasonable .",
    "for comparison , we plot the ratio for adding the clustering term in fir . in this case the integration of @xmath90 over @xmath83 does not converge because our assumed value of @xmath91 is valid only for angular separation less than @xmath92 .",
    "thus we evaluate the flux simply by multiplying @xmath93 as in the case of the gaussian profile .",
    "therefore @xmath94 includes the contribution of other galaxies , but the total amplitude is subject to change depending on the more accurate profile at larger angular scales .",
    "the total ratio follows a clear single power - law and we believe that the wiggles of the ratio for single galaxies is not real but comes from the difficulty in separate the single galaxy contribution from the total signal as mentioned at the end of the previous section .",

    "this procedure enables us to find sdss optical counterparts for @xmath95 of the pscz galaxies that are located in the sdss survey region .",
    "we apply the k - correction based on the `` k - corrections calculator '' service @xcite for @xmath1-band , and extrapolate the fir spectral energy densities using second - order polynomials determined from 25 , 60 @xmath96 flux for 100 @xmath9 @xcite .",

    "the solid lines correspond to @xmath99 and 50 for reference .",
    "thus the approximate linear relation implied from figure [ fig : fir - rband - ratio ] is largely consistent with figure [ fig : nul - distribution ] since the iras galaxies may be preferentially biased toward the fir brighter ones than average . in turn , this confirms that our interpretation that @xmath100 represents the contribution of a single galaxy .",

    "the profiles are not completely circular , and also the best - fit parameters do not exhibit regular behavior as a function of @xmath26 .",
    "part of the behavior may be due to the contamination of non - quasars objects in the photometric quasar sample",
    ". therefore it would be better to repeat the analysis for the spectroscopic quasar sample , which we plan to do in due course .",

    "<S> we select @xmath0 galaxies in total from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) dr7 photometric catalog . </S>",
    "<S> we detect clear signatures of the enhancement of the extinction in @xmath1-band , @xmath2 , around galaxies , indicating that the extinction map is contaminated by their fir ( far infrared ) emission . </S>",
    "<S> the average amplitude of the contamination per galaxy is well fitted to @xmath3}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> while this value is very small , it is directly associated with galaxies and may have a systematic effect on galaxy statistics . </S>",
    "<S> indeed this correlated contamination leads to a relatively large anomaly of galaxy surface number densities against the sfd extinction @xmath4 discovered by @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we model the radial profiles of stacked galaxy images , and find that the fir signal around each galaxy does not originate from the central galaxy alone , but is dominated by the contributions of nearby galaxies via galaxy angular clustering . </S>",
    "<S> the separation of the single galaxy and the clustering terms enables us to infer the statistical relation of the fir and @xmath1-band fluxes of galaxies and also to probe the flux - weighted cross - correlation of galaxies , down to the magnitudes that are difficult to probe directly for individual objects . </S>",
    "<S> we repeat the same stacking analysis for sdss dr6 photometric quasars and discovered the similar signatures but with weaker amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> the implications of the present results for galaxy and quasar statistics and for correction to the galactic extinction map are briefly discussed . </S>"
