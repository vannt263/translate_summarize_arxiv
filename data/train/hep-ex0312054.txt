    "tracks reconstructed from hits in the drift chamber and silicon are combined with neutral showers in the calorimeter to form missing energy and momentum estimates .",
    "considerable effort is made to remove spurious tracks and showers from hadronic interactions , in order to give the best estimate of the neutrino energy and momentum . when the neutrino candidate is combined with a lepton and light meson candidate , energy and momentum conservation leads to signal peaks in @xmath7 and the @xmath0 candidate invariant mass @xmath8 , with @xmath9 .",
