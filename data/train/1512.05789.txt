    "quantum key distribution ( qkd ) offers communications security without reliance on computational presumptions by taking advantage of fundamental properties of quantum mechanics  @xcite . despite reaching maturity that supports commercial implementation  @xcite",
    ", qkd has yet to achieve widespread use , in large part owing to distance limitations , on the order of , inherent to lossy terrestrial transmissions  @xcite .",
    "quantum repeaters  @xcite promise to overcome this shortcoming , but they require high - fidelity quantum memories which are still in the fundamental research stage  @xcite and are not yet viable for real - world application .",
    "alternatively , quantum links to orbiting satellites can be implemented using existing technologies  @xcite .",
    "one near - term approach to satellite - based qkd is where a satellite , acting as a trusted node , performs two consecutive quantum key exchanges with two different ground stations .",
    "a combination of the two keys is then publicly revealed , allowing one ground station to extract the other s key , giving both locations a shared key in a way that no other party ( except for the satellite ) can surreptitiously intercept .",
    "this approach may be implemented with either uplink ( photons sent from ground station transmitter to satellite receiver ) or downlink ( photons sent from satellite transmitter to ground station receiver ) . the feasibility of both of these has been extensively studied  @xcite . while a downlink benefits from lower transmission losses , allowing higher key rates , an uplink offers the advantage of a simpler satellite design , easier pointing , reduced on - board data collection requirements , and source flexibility , which makes an uplink the preferred scenario for scientific study  @xcite .",
    "a significant challenge in the uplink scenario is operating with the high photon loss experienced ( ) .",
    "previous work demonstrated that key extraction is possible , in principle , beyond of loss in the infinite key limit  @xcite .",
    "however , this work did not perform all of the steps necessary to implement the qkd protocol and produce a secure key .",
    "( indeed , experimental qkd demonstrations routinely go no further than calculate the expected length of the secure key based on observed parameters . ) here we experimentally demonstrate key extraction at various transmission loss levels , up to , while including all the qkd processing steps required to finally extract a secure key .",
    "we also examine the effect of finite statistics , and assess the time required to achieve near - asymptotic key rates in the high - loss environment .",
    "further , we show the feasibility of ground  satellite qkd by experimentally recreating the varying losses of three realistic uplink satellite passes .",
    "our apparatus has the two parties involved in the high - loss qkd transmission operating independently , each party having separate event time - taggers , global positioning system ( gps ) receivers , and classical processing mediated by a classical communication channel . because we focus on a future satellite implantation , computational requirements are also a key aspect .",
    "the system we have developed attempts to reduce , as much as possible , these requirements at the receiver .",
    "we analyze the complexity of the classical processing functions , and demonstrate operation on low - power embedded hardware .",
    "we show that the requirements are feasible , making our overall design suitable for a satellite payload .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "details the steps of the qkd protocol and the approaches we have taken to optimize it for a satellite uplink .",
    "describes the experimental apparatus we constructed to perform our demonstrations . presents the results in two parts : [ sec : requirements ] shows the results of our computational analysis , while [ sec : qkdresults ] shows the results of our experimental qkd demonstration .",
    "we close with discussion and conclusion in [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the seminal qkd protocol , bb84  @xcite encodes information in the polarization states of single photons .",
    "ideally , at each time - step alice randomly selects one of four polarizations in two bases  horizontal ( h ) , vertical ( v ) , diagonal ( d ) , or anti - diagonal ( a)and sends a photon with this polarization to bob .",
    "bob randomly selects a basis , h / v or d / a , and measures the photon to obtain one of four outcomes .",
    "this procedure occurs for many time - steps , and after revealing the bases used , alice and bob `` sift '' their events , discarding those which have mismatched bases . by defining h and d to correspond to a bit value of 0 , and v and a to correspond to a bit value of 1 , alice and bob retain a common string of random bits  the _ sifted _ key  @xcite .",
    "practical implementations have extra complications : photons are lost in transmission , imperfections in photon source and detection devices introduce errors ( which must be corrected ) , and weak coherent pulse sources , which are often used in place of true single - photon sources , exhibit potentially insecure multi - photon emission events .",
    "decoy - state protocols  @xcite , with error correction and privacy amplification as classical post - processing steps , have been developed to overcome these issues .",
    "theoretical qkd security proofs provide equations for the secure key rate based on experimentally measurable parameters such as the quantum bit error ratio ( qber ) , background noise counts , and decoy parameters .",
    "these allow us to make a statement about the security of the _ final _ key after the quantum transmission is complete .",
    "most importantly , these equations determine the amount of privacy amplification required to be able to claim @xmath0 security  @xcite . once the post - processing is complete and the final key deemed secure , it can then be used in a classical encryption protocol such as one - time pad .",
    "we implement the vacuum+weak decoy - state protocol  @xcite , in which alice randomly emits signal states with average photon number @xmath1 , or decoy states that are either vacuum or have an average photon number @xmath2 . in our implementation ( [ fig.system_schematic ] ) , alice employs polarization and intensity modulation  @xcite to prepare a random sequence of bb84 polarization encodings which are 92% signal and 8% decoy states .",
    "our average photon numbers are @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which are near the optimal for this protocol .",

    "the parameters in equations ( [ eq : securerate])([eq : e1u ] ) are determined from experimental data to obtain the asymptotic lower bound for the secret key rate per laser pulse , @xmath19 . to obtain the secure key rate in bits per second ,",
    "@xmath19 is multiplied by the pulse rate of the wcp source .",
    "proper generation of a secure key needs to incorporate the effects of statistical fluctuations due to finite - sized experimental data  @xcite .",
    "to account for this we use the common heuristic of adding or subtracting @xmath20 variation from the experimental parameters in such a way as to minimize the key rate  @xcite .",
    "( a recently proposed method may allow to account for statistical fluctuation in a more rigorous fashion  @xcite . )",

    "the design of our classical post - processing software follows the principle that alice should perform as many of the computationally intensive tasks as possible , as the ground station can be made rich in computing resources , compared to the limited capacity of a satellite payload . in our system , alice , being the source of the optical signal over the high - loss link , is responsible for high - rate data readout .",
    "she also performs timing analysis ( to match bob s classically transmitted time - tagged photon detection events to her time - tagged source events ) and basis sifting , afterwards sending simplified coincidence information back to bob .",
    "we also choose a one - way error correction algorithm based on low - density parity - check codes  @xcite , in which alice performs the computationally expensive decoding algorithm while bob only runs a linear algorithm to compute his syndromes ( see [ sec : ldpc ] ) .",
    "this scheme has the additional advantage of having low classical communication overhead .",
    "finally , both parties perform a toeplitz - matrix - based  @xcite privacy amplification routine suitable for low - power hardware implementation ( see [ sec : pa ] ) .",
    "we separate bob s software into two components : a driving control environment , and an embedded processing component .",
    "the driving control component is responsible for all platform - dependent tasks , e.g.  loading time - tagger operating system drivers , configuring time - taggers , reading out time - tags and displaying live statistics . to be suitable for implantation into a yet - to - be - designed satellite , bob s embedded processing component",
    "is implemented in a platform - agnostic way using a portable low - level language ( c ) .",
    "it is executed as a separate process on an x86 - 64 desktop computer , or on a low - power arm development board , and performs the bulk of bob s necessary processing tasks .    because bob s embedded component runs in a standalone process , its usage of computing resources can be accurately monitored .",
    "moreover , the driving control component records the bandwidth used for classical communication .",
    "this design allows us to make an accurate assessment of the classical post - processing requirements and guide our analysis of the computing requirements of bob s part of the qkd protocol .",
    "several practical issues complicate the process of determining which time - tagged photon detections correspond to particular source events , including initial clock synchronization , drift over time , and variation in photon time - of - flight . for our apparatus ,",
    "an extra complication is that our data acquisition hardware is not capable of operating at the high pulse frequency of the laser source ( see [ sec : apparatus ] ) .    to reduce the heavy load on the time - tagger at the source ,",
    "only a subset of the laser s output pulses are time - tagged . with alice utilizing a predefined ( known only to alice ) randomized sequence of pulse states , we assume that the laser s period is stable on the order of , and interpolate to reconstruct the transmitted states for timing analysis .",
    "the predefined sequence is not a requirement of the time - tagger but is necessary due to limitations of the modulation electronics at the source , which require a preloaded sequence .    to reduce clock drift",
    ", we align the time - tagging units internal clocks to a time - base signal provided by a gps receiver at each site .",
    "initial synchronization is achieved with the one pulse per second ( ) signal provided by the gps receivers .",
    "position data is supplied with these signals , which can be used in conjunction with time data to estimate the distance between alice and bob , and hence , the time - of - flight of the photons between the source and the receiver .    in our system ,",
    "photon detections are tagged with a resolution of , but the signals are accurate to @xmath31 .",
    "additional analysis is required to identify corresponding emission and detection events to within a desired coincidence window of about .",
    "the algorithm to achieve this synchronization utilizes the timing information from bob s time - tags , alice s transmitted photon states , alice s and bob s gps timing and position data , as well as a small subset ( @xmath32 ) of bob s measured outcomes .",
    "alice employs a histogram - based optimizing coincidence search within a predefined time span ( about ) .",
    "the subset of bob s revealed measured outcomes ( which are discarded from the final key ) are also used to estimate the qber to commence the error correction stage of the qkd protocol .    once coincident events have been identified and noncoincident events removed",
    ", alice performs basis sifting of her raw key to produce her sifted key and transmits a list of indices to bob , which he utilizes to equivalently sift ( for both time and basis , simultaneously ) his photon detection events",
    ".      low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) codes are highly suitable for satellite - based qkd due to the low communication overhead required and the inherent asymmetry in the computational complexity at each site .",
    "first , alice prepares an @xmath33 irregular  @xcite parity - check matrix , where @xmath34 is the sifted key block size , and @xmath35 is based on the qber estimate obtained during timing analysis .",
    "we use progressive - edge growth software  @xcite ( modified from  @xcite ) , employing known optimal degree distribution profiles  @xcite , to generate the parity - check matrix .",
    "alice then transmits the matrix in a compact form to bob over a classical channel . for each @xmath34-bit block of his sifted key",
    ", bob runs an efficient linear algorithm to compute a syndrome using this matrix , and transmits it to alice .",
    "alice then attempts to reconcile her sifted key assuming that bob s sifted key is `` correct '' ( it remains unchanged throughout this process ) . for each block of sifted key",
    ", alice s goal is to resolve bob s key vector @xmath36 , based on her key vector @xmath37 , bob s syndrome @xmath38 , the parity - check matrix , and the estimated qber . to accomplish this task",
    ", alice employs _",
    "belief propagation _ , an iterative message passing decoding algorithm , also known as the sum - product algorithm  @xcite .",
    "our sum - product ldpc decoder is written in c # and is based on that found in  @xcite . upon success ,",
    "alice and bob both possess the @xmath34-bit error - corrected key block @xmath39 and obtain the exact qber for the quantum transmission , @xmath40 .    by shannon s channel coding theorem  @xcite",
    "applied to the binary symmetric channel  @xcite , we can deduce a closed - form estimate of the appropriate size of the ldpc matrix based on the ( estimated , denoted by a tilde ) qber  @xcite : @xmath41 .",
    "the decoding step may yet terminate unsuccessfully with a given matrix and key block  the probability of this decreases as @xmath35 ( and thus @xmath9 ) is increased . in the case of such a termination , we may either discard the key block or retry the algorithm with an augmented matrix containing all the rows of the previous matrix , similar to the `` nested '' ldpc codes proposed in  @xcite . in a satellite mission , the choice can be based on the availability of the classical communication channel .",
    "our implementation exhibits efficiencies ( @xmath9 ) ranging from 1.1 to 1.5 .    the silent failure probability of the belief propagation procedure  i.e .",
    ", the probability that the process terminates successfully but there remains one or more uncorrected bits  is not well characterized in existing literature . while we have not observed any silent failures during our testing , we can not be certain that @xmath42 is achieved . to ensure such certainty , one could calculate , reveal , and compare a fingerprint hash of @xmath36 and @xmath43 .",
    "( such an approach using 128-bit md5 sums  , for example , yields a collision probability , and thus a silent failure probability , of order @xmath44 . ) to account for the revealed bits , the final key length would need to be reduced by the same ( constant ) number of bits .",
    "because the necessity of these extra steps and the specific method of implementation are unclear , we do not perform these steps here .",
    "the error - corrected key block @xmath43 is only partially secure , as some information may have leaked to an eavesdropper ( eve)we attribute the observed qber to eve s interaction with the signal , and all parity information communicated during error correction is known to eve as it was transmitted over a public channel . privacy amplification is employed to create a new , final , key @xmath45 on which eve no longer holds more than negligible amount of information .",
    "the procedure consists of applying a _ two - universal hash function _",
    "@xcite to @xmath43 to produce a provably secure key block @xmath45 of length @xmath46 ( recall @xmath34 is the sifted key block size ) .",

    ", @xmath34 should be kept above a certain value , typically @xmath48 , as finite - size effects heavily impact keys with lower @xmath34 .",
    "this value is taken into consideration when selecting a hash function .",
    "privacy amplification is a symmetric operation which needs to be performed by both alice and bob .",
    "the choice of hash function dictates the computational complexity of the process and the amount of classical communication required . in our implementation , the privacy amplification procedure loosely follows the methodology outlined in  @xcite  however , we have made some alterations to their model and developed a different matrix multiplication procedure suitable for efficient implementation in hardware .",
    "briefly , we employ the toeplitz matrix  @xcite construction implemented using a shift register .",
    "a toeplitz matrix has constant descending left - to - right diagonal elements .",
    "an @xmath49 toeplitz matrix can be written as @xmath50 a toeplitz matrix is a two - universal hash function  @xcite .",
    "note that a toeplitz matrix @xmath51 is completely defined by the @xmath52-bit vector @xmath53 , thus its storage and transmission requirements are considerably reduced .",

    "following error correction , alice generates such a matrix by constructing a random binary string @xmath58 of length @xmath57 , and then transmits @xmath59 to bob over the classical channel .",

    "the identity portion of each row of @xmath60 uses no space and can be accounted for with a simple logical and operation .",
    "we represent @xmath51 as an @xmath62-bit logical shift register .",
    "initially , the shift register contains the last @xmath63 bits of @xmath59 , @xmath64 .",
    "the remaining bits from @xmath59 are used as input for the shift register . in this way",
    ", we conserve memory by never needing to store full matrices .",
    "the logical shift register is broken up into multiple 32-bit blocks , each of which is designed to fit inside a register on a processing unit .",
    "the register size of 32 bits is chosen for the support of multiple platforms , including our low - power arm test board .",
    "64-bit platforms are also available , and with single instruction , multiple data ( simd ) extensions , commonplace in contemporary desktop processors , the register could be 256 bits or larger .    after privacy amplification ,",
    "alice and bob are left with a secure key of @xmath47 bits which can then be used to encrypt data transmitted on a classical channel through , e.g. , one - time pad .",
    "we assume here that channel authentication is performed separately , possibly using some of the secure key ( reducing the length available for encryption ) .",
    "our qkd system , shown in [ fig.system_schematic ] , consists of a weak coherent pulse ( wcp ) source , a variable - loss free - space channel , and a compact four - outcome ( two passively chosen measurement bases ) quantum receiver .",
    "the source utilizes up - conversion ( sum frequency generation ) from two orthogonally oriented type - i periodically poled potassium titanyl phosphate ( ppktp ) crystals to produce photon pulses at wavelength from a mode - locked ti : sapphire laser at , operating at a rate of , and a continuous - wave laser at .",
    "diagonally polarized laser pulses are combined with polarization- and intensity - modulated laser light ( controlled by efficient telecom waveguide modulators  @xcite ) to generate pulses possessing the short pulse width and high repetition rate of the laser , as well as the intensity and polarization of the light .",
    "phase randomization between pulses , necessary to ensure security , is provided by the short coherence time of the laser ( less than the pulsing period of the laser , but much more than the pulse duration ) .",
    "birefringent wedges precompensate the light for temporal walk - off in the ppktp crystals .",
    "the photon pulses produced are coupled into single - mode fiber .",
    "a fiber splitter sends @xmath65 of photons to a thick - silicon avalanche photodiode ( excelitas spcm - aq4c ) to measure the average photon number per pulse .",
    "the remaining photons are sent to a free - space quantum channel consisting of a bare fiber output followed by a 3-inch - diameter lens on a longitudinal translation stage .",
    "the loss is adjusted by varying the position of the lens , changing the amount of light directed into the receiver by making the beam more or less divergent .    the quantum receiver , [ fig.receiver_schematic ] ,",
    "is built using thorlabs cage system .",
    "the receiving telescope consists of a diameter , focal length collection lens followed by a diameter , focal length collimating lens .",
    "passive measurement basis choice is implemented by coupling polarization discrimination apparatuses to two orthogonal outputs of a pentaprism beam - splitter , each of which transmits approximately of the injected power .",
    "( a pentaprism was chosen for potential application in future experiments",
    " a 50:50 beam - splitter would also suffice as we do not here use the pentaprism s third output . )",
    "polarization analysis is done by a cubic polarizing beam - splitter ( pbs ) in each arm , directing photons to one of four detector assemblies .",

    "based on the measured experimental parameters , we can extrapolate the raw key rates and determine the achievable finite - size secure key rate if the apparatus was run for longer times or multiple runs under the same conditions were concatenated .",
    "shows the ratio of the asymptotic key rate that can be achieved by the finite secure key ( @xmath74 ) , for a given total number of pulses transmitted , for each experimental loss condition we examine .",
    "for the lowest losses , only about @xmath75 pulses is necessary to reach over of the asymptotic key rate , equating to a few minutes of collection time with our source .",
    "more time is required for higher losses : several weeks of continuous collection at , for the highest losses .",
    "interestingly , we find that the data produces nonzero secure key sooner than the data  this is owing to the relatively high qber at .",
    "our results consistently show a significantly higher decoy qber compared to the signal qber .",
    "this was caused by the intensity modulator which was found to produce a slight polarization shift that is dependent on the applied modulation , causing the two different intensity levels to have slightly different polarizations before being polarization modulated , leading to a difference in the optimal alignment for the two intensity levels .",
    "this polarization shift could be corrected by the addition of a polarizer after the intensity modulator , eliminating the polarization difference between the two states . although this difference does not invalidate our proof - of - concept demonstration , removing it is crucial in a secure implementation as it leads to distinguishability between signal and decoy states which could be used by an eavesdropper to gain information .",
    "removing this difference may also improve final key rates as it would reduce decoy qber without affecting signal qber .",
    "our system alignment is optimized for the signal qber .",
    "the results presented here are comparable to the regime of a satellite uplink , where the usable part of a pass is expected to vary typically between loss  @xcite , and help support the conclusion that our approach is suitable for eventual satellite implantation ( though a faster source may be advised ) .",
    "to more closely examine the feasibility of our approach in the regime of a satellite uplink for qkd , we simulate several satellite passes by varying the position of the quantum - channel lens ( thus varying the loss ) during an experimental run .",
    "we do this once , the total run lasting approximately 45  minutes , with the loss changing smoothly from @xmath76 to a minimum of @xmath76 after about 21  minutes , and then back to @xmath76 over the remaining time .",
    "the data accumulated are segmented into blocks , with the measured loss for each second over the duration of the experiment shown in [ fig.varying_loss ] .",
    "we redistribute select blocks of raw key data in such a way that we obtain data sets that reproduce the statistics expected for real satellite uplink orbits  @xcite .",
    "the passes considered are the best , upper - quartile and median passes ( in terms of contact time ) over a hypothetical ground station located at latitude of a year - long circular sun - synchronous low earth orbit .",
    "the predicted losses are based on uplink at a wavelength of , with a receiver diameter of , a pointing error and a rural sea - level atmosphere .",
    "the differences with our system ( which has wavelength and receiver diameter ) are necessary to mitigate the increased geometric losses over the long distance link of a satellite ( requiring larger receiver diameter ) and the effect of atmospheric turbulence and transmission ( reduced at compared to ) .",
    "both our system and the expected system utilize the same si avalanche photodiode technology .",
    "analyzing our experimental data possessing these theoretical losses is therefore a valid proof - of - concept demonstration .",
    "the experimental data are smoothed by taking the median of a moving window of width , the result illustrated in [ fig.varying_loss ] .",
    "we use these smoothed data to select experimental data blocks to include in our analysis for each orbit by progressively scanning ( from the center , in either direction ) in steps for the next data block that possesses smoothed loss matching or exceeding the theoretical orbit loss prediction . by selecting experimental data at points where the smoothed loss is matched to theoretical link predictions , we ensure that the data we sample are not biased by normal fluctuations in measured loss .    ) for three representative satellite pass conditions : best pass ( top ) , upper - quartile pass ( middle ) , and median pass ( bottom ) .",
    "the predicted loss is based on an uplink with a circular sun - synchronous low earth orbit satellite at a wavelength of , with a receiver diameter of , a pointing error and a rural sea - level atmosphere .",
    "smoothed loss follows the moving median determined at each experimental data block selected .",
    "measured loss and qber derive from the selected data , with shaded regions indicating the qber credible interval based on a uniform bayesian prior . for the best pass ,",
    "we obtain of secure key , including finite - size statistical effects . ]",
    "shows the three relevant losses  the theoretically predicted loss , the smoothed loss value at the sampled point , and the experimentally measured loss from the sampled point  and the estimated qber for each representative pass .",
    "the measured losses of the sampled experimental data closely match the trend of the theoretical prediction , whilst maintaining realistic fluctuation . at higher losses",
    "the per - second qber estimate has significant fluctuations due to the reduced sample size .    performing the post - processing steps on these data sets and incorporating finite - sized statistics , we are able to extract a secure key from the best pass , out of a total of raw key ( detection events ) with an average of qber in the signal .",
    "this result shows that even with our modest source a positive key rate can feasibly be generated from one pass ( albeit a good one ) of a typical low earth orbit satellite receiver . in comparison ,",
    "the upper - quartile pass receives raw key ( detections ) with an average of qber , but this is insufficient to produce nonzero secure key with finite - sized effects considered ( the asymptotic secure key is ) .",
    "similarly , the median pass with raw key ( detections ) and average qber also can not extract nonzero finite - sized secure key ( asymptotic , ) .",
    "improvements to the source could mitigate finite - sized statistical effects . by adjusting the photon and pulse count parameters",
    ", we can predict the performance of a source that produces @xmath77 signal ( i.e.  a signal rate , as per  @xcite ) , @xmath78 decoy , and @xmath78 vacuum pulses . with other measured parameters",
    "left unchanged , secure key could be extracted from a single upper - quartile pass .",
    "this is directly comparable to the estimation of  @xcite  under better conditions ( e.g.  @xmath79 assumed equal to @xmath40 , intrinsic source qber of 1% , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and background estimate used only in calculation of @xmath40 while setting @xmath82 ) , a secure key was predicted .",
    "alternatively , finite - size effects could be reduced by combining the measurements of multiple passes .",
    "for example , we are able to combine the measurements of three upper - quartile passes  each independently unable to produce positive finite key  and thereby extract of secure key with finite - sized statistics .",
    "( significantly more median passes , around 215 combined , would be required to yield positive finite - size secure key . )",
    "this might be a useful method to extract longer secure keys from the results of multiple marginal or individually unfruitful satellite passes .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : measured_quantities ]    the quantities measured in the experiment are summarized , in [ tab : measured_quantities ] , for each of the fixed loss cases and for each of the three varying - loss satellite - pass simulations .",
    "these are the values we use in [ eq : securerate ] and [ eq : finitesizerate ] to determine the secure key length .",
    "we have demonstrated the feasibility of satellite qkd using a quantum optical uplink by successfully performing qkd at losses up to in the laboratory , with reduced computational requirements at the receiver , compatible with those that can be achieved on a satellite platform .",
    "we have improved over a previous high - loss demonstration  @xcite by implementing complete qkd protocols , including twin - basis measurements , error correction and privacy amplification .",
    "we have also considered the effect of statistical fluctuations on the finite key length and have shown , by successfully performing full qkd and by extrapolation with varying losses that match those that would be experienced during representative passes of a satellite , that such a system is viable .",
    "several improvements to our system are possible as a next step , improving the key rate and moving our system towards being immediately deployable .",
    "one necessary modification to ensure secure qkd would be to employ a truly random source at alice , rather than a fixed - length repeating pseudorandom sequence .",
    "suitable high - speed electronics to implement this in tandem with a source with increased pulse rate could provide true security while significantly improving key rates above those reported here .",
    "while increased rates would necessitate more processing at the receiver , our analysis of computational requirements shows that detection rates could be increased by an order of magnitude or more over the demonstrated best - pass rate with processing at the receiver remaining feasible .",
    "a particularly important challenge of satellite qkd yet to be addressed is the varying time of flight due to the changing distance between the satellite and ground station during a pass . for a orbit",
    "the distance between the satellite and ground station will vary by up to  @xcite , leading to a time of flight varying by up to per second .",
    "correcting for such variation as part of the timing analysis is straightforward , in principle , but is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "notably , though not of the same magnitude , varying time of flight due to relative motion has been demonstrated in the context of qkd for moving transmitters  @xcite and , very recently , a moving receiver  @xcite .",
    "additionally , our theoretical prediction of loss for a satellite pass is based on a diameter receiver at , while our system uses a receiver and operates at .",
    "these differences do not affect the proof - of - concept demonstrated in this paper nor the basic design of our apparatus as the operating principles are the same in either case .",
    "however , the optimal parameters will need to be satisfied to ensure success of a satellite uplink  the increased telescope diameter is necessary to reduce the geometric losses , and the wavelength is necessary to provide the best balance between diffraction , atmospheric absorption and turbulence , and detector efficiency  @xcite .",
    "together with a sufficiently accurate pointing mechanism , these engineering challenges for implementing a quantum receiver satellite payload are manifestly achievable in the near term .",
