    "the unification of quantum theory and gravity is one of the central open problems in physics .",
    "several approaches to a theory of quantum gravity have been developed @xcite , but in order to ultimately decide which approach describes nature best , we need testable predictions . finding such predictions is problematic , because quantum - gravitational effects might only become sizable at energies of the order of the planck scale .",
    "a promising scenario to look for such effects is the highly energetic inflationary phase in the very early universe .",
    "this is also the topic of the present paper .    in our work",
    ", we will focus on a rather conservative approach to quantum gravity based on a canonical quantization that leads to the wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation .",
    "we study how quantum fluctuations of spacetime are influenced by quantum - gravitational effects during inflation and whether the resulting corrections to the power spectra of primordial fluctuations can be observed in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",

    "canonical quantum gravity and the wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation may not yield the ultimate quantum theory of gravity , but they should give a reliable picture at least close to the planck scale ; the wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation is the quantum wave equation that directly gives the einstein equations in the semiclassical limit @xcite .",
    "quantum field theory in curved spacetime follows from the wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation in a born  oppenheimer type of approximation scheme @xcite .",
    "this scheme may be realized by a formal expansion with respect to the planck mass @xcite , but it can be realized also in another way that is closer to the standard born ",
    "oppenheimer approximation in molecular physics @xcite .",
    "going one order beyond this limit yields the quantum - gravitational corrections derived here .",
    "previously , this approximation was already used to derive such corrections from the planck - mass expansion @xcite and from an alternative expansion @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we continue with this investigation in the following ways .",
    "first , we apply the planck - mass expansion scheme to the scalar and tensor perturbations described in a fully gauge - invariant way .",
    "second , we keep all the terms in the resulting quantum - gravitationally corrected schrdinger equation for the perturbation modes and explicitly address the issue of the appearing unitarity - violating terms .",
    "we restrict ourselves here to the de sitter case .",
    "this investigation represents the preparation we need in order to expand our analysis to the general case of slow - roll inflation , which we shall present in a follow - up paper .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we first give an introduction to how perturbations of spacetime are dealt with in a hamiltonian framework .",
    "the quantization of this system is discussed following the dirac method .",
    "then , the construction of perturbative gauge - invariant quantities is presented , which leads to a trivialization of the perturbative constraints and allows for a reduced phase space quantization . in section iii",
    ", we then formulate the wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation for our model of a perturbed inflationary universe .",
    "sections ii and iii are presented in some detail because they contain important reference material for later papers .",
    "section iv is dedicated to the semiclassical approximation of this wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation and it is at this point where we derive a schrdinger equation with quantum - gravitational correction terms for the quantized spacetime perturbations . in section v we describe the gaussian ansatz for the wave function representing the perturbations and we use this in section vi to derive the general expression for the power spectra of the scalar and tensor modes .",
    "we then present concrete results for the usual ( uncorrected ) power spectra in a de sitter universe in section vii .",
    "finally we calculate the quantum - gravitationally corrected power spectra for this case numerically as well as  after a linearization  analytically in section viii .",
    "section ix presents the main conclusions and comments on the comparison between the present and previous approaches .",
    "let us assume general relativity with the metric minimally coupled to a scalar matter field @xmath0 .",
    "the complete action of this system in the hamiltonian form can be written in the following way : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the metric on the three - dimensional spatial slices defined by the foliation given by the time function @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the conjugate momentum of the scalar field @xmath0 , and @xmath5 is the conjugate momentum of the spatial metric .",

    ", @xmath14 is the potential of the scalar field , @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the covariant derivative associated with @xmath2 , and all latin indices are raised and lowered by @xmath2 .",
    "the einstein equations can be obtained by direct variation of the action above . in particular",
    ", the constraints read @xmath17 the rest of the equations corresponds to the time derivatives of the metric , the scalar field and their conjugate momentums .",
    "nonetheless , their exact form is not needed for our purposes , so they are not explicitly displayed here .",
    "equations ( [ eq_back1 ] ) and ( [ eq_back2 ] ) are the general constraint equations of canonical quantum gravity . in the following ,",
    "however , we will refer to them as the ` background equations ' , and the total constraint equations will consist of this background and the perturbations .      as a preparation for our application in the remaining part of the paper , we will here and in the next subsection",
    "analyze the evolution of small perturbations around a background that obeys the equations of the previous section .",
    "let us assume that all quantities depend on a dimensionless parameter @xmath18 , which defines a one - parameter family of spacetimes @xmath19 .",
    "the value @xmath20 corresponds to the background spacetime . in this way ,",
    "a variational ( or perturbative ) operator @xmath21 can be defined as @xmath22 making use of this operator , the perturbations of different quantities are named in the following way : @xmath23 the extremal value of the action , derived from @xmath24 provides the equations of motion for the background quantities .",
    "furthermore , as shown in @xcite , the second variation of the action gives an effective action functional for the perturbations , @xmath25 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first and second variations of the background constraints lead to expressions @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 that are explicitly given in e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the equations for the small perturbations are then obtained by variation of the action ( [ effaction ] ) with respect to the perturbative variables ( [ perturbative_variables ] ) . in particular , the variations with respect to @xmath30 and @xmath31",
    "give the constraints that must be obeyed by the perturbations : @xmath32 the rest of the dynamical equations are obtained by taking the variations with respect to @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .    as mentioned in the previous section , in full general relativity",
    "the hamiltonian is just a linear combination of constraints and thus it vanishes on - shell ( except for possible boundary terms ) .",
    "nevertheless , as shown here , for the small perturbations evolving on a given background the situation is different .",
    "the hamiltonian for the perturbations can be directly read from ( [ effaction ] ) : @xmath37 on - shell , due to the perturbative constraint equations ( [ perturbative_constraint1]-[perturbative_constraint2 ] ) , the first two terms of the last equation vanish .",
    "but the last two terms of this equation do not vanish and constitute a physical , non - zero , hamiltonian for the perturbative degrees of freedom : @xmath38 note that in this perturbative hamiltonian the background quantities do not appear as dynamical variables .",
    "that is , they are assumed to be given and are not basic variables that encode physical degrees of freedom .",
    "the system can be understood as a hierarchy of systems , which can be solved order by order .",
    "the background quantities are obtained as a solution to the background einstein equations and are as such plugged in the action ( [ effaction ] ) .",
    "therefore , in this sense , the background quantities are non - dynamical in the hamiltonian @xmath39 .      in spite of the comments in the last paragraph , in order to quantize the system , it is necessary to have a complete action for all degrees of freedom .",
    "this can be constructed just by writing together the background action and its second variation : @xmath41 which defines the total hamiltonian of the system : @xmath42 everything seems fine up to this point : the variation of the total action ( [ total_action ] ) with respect to the perturbative variables ( [ perturbative_variables ] ) gives the linearized einstein equations of motion .",
    "this is because @xmath43 does not depend on the perturbative variables and , therefore , the variation of @xmath44 with respect to the perturbative variables is exactly the same as the variation of @xmath45 .",
    "nonetheless , @xmath45 does depend on background quantities .",
    "thus , if one takes the variations of the full action @xmath44 with respect to the background quantities in order to obtain their equations of motion , one will get the background equations plus certain correction terms quadratic in the perturbations .",
    "in particular , regarding the constraints , instead of obtaining equations ( [ eq_back1][eq_back2 ] ) we will get @xmath46 therefore , by using this full action to describe our physical system , we are assuming that the background einstein equations are not exactly obeyed .",
    "nonetheless , one could obtain the exact background and perturbative equations from the total hamiltonian ( [ total_hamiltonian ] ) by truncating the system at @xmath18 order .    at a classical level ,",
    "the discussion above is not very relevant since , as already mentioned , all the properties and results we can derive from this framework ( by truncating the expansion of the action at a quadratic level ) can only be trusted at @xmath18 order .",
    "nonetheless , this has a great importance when quantizing this system .",
    "we will assume a canonical quantization , where the wave function will depend on position variables .",
    "all `` positions '' @xmath47 and their corresponding conjugate momenta @xmath48 will be promoted to operators , the first ones acting multiplicatively and the latter ones as derivatives of their corresponding conjugate positions .",
    "therefore , the situation can now be interpreted in two alternative ways .",
    "on the one hand , if one assumed that the equations of motion should be truncated at linear order , and that the background equations are exactly obeyed , as we explained in the preceding section , the constraints to be imposed on the wave function would be : @xmath49 in this case there is , in addition , also a physical hamiltonian @xmath50 for some of the degrees of freedom .",
    "this hamiltonian would in principle lead to a schrdinger equation : @xmath51 where the time parameter @xmath52 should be defined from the background variables .",
    "nonetheless , this approach does not provide a direct interaction between the quantized background and perturbations in the sense that each obeys its own equations of motion .",
    "note that if in equations ( [ quantizeddeltah][schroedinger ] ) only the perturbative degrees of freedom were quantized , whereas for the background variables their classical behavior were considered , one would obtain the limit of quantum field theories on a fixed background spacetime .",
    "in fact , a schrdinger equation like ( [ schroedinger ] ) results in a natural way from the born ",
    "oppenheimer scheme presented below in that limit .",
    "but the important point is that we want to go beyond that limit and for this purpose the dynamical behavior of the background variables is important .",
    "the quantum - gravitational corrections derived in our paper come from the interaction of `` perturbations '' and `` background '' .    in order to obtain such a _ direct interaction _ between the quantized background and the perturbative degrees of freedom , one should directly quantize all degrees of freedom with the hamiltonian ( [ total_hamiltonian ] ) . in this approach",
    ", there is no physical ( non - vanishing ) hamiltonian , and one would have to impose the following constraints on the wave function : @xmath53 this latter one is the method followed in @xcite and many other papers in order to go beyond the approximation of quantum field theories on fixed backgrounds ( see in particular the treatment in @xcite ) .",
    "we will also work within this approach because it gives a consistent formulation in the quantum theory .",
    "the problem is that equations ( [ ham_constraint][deltaham_constraint ] ) are extremely difficult to be solved even for simple cosmological models .",
    "therefore , before quantizing the constraint equations , one can perform a convenient canonical transformation to a new set of variables for which the linearized constraints ( [ quantum_constraint1 ] ) and ( [ quantum_constraint2 ] ) take a much simpler form or , in the best of the cases , they are automatically obeyed .",
    "this can be done by constructing so - called master gauge - invariant variables , to which we now turn .",
    "the constraints ( [ perturbative_constraint1][perturbative_constraint2 ] ) are the generators of the perturbative gauge freedom . instead of quantizing the whole system @xmath40 , as described in the previous section",
    ", one could solve some of these perturbative constraints classically and perform a reduced phase space quantization .",
    "one way to solve or , better to say , trivialize these constraints is by constructing gauge - invariant quantities which encode the complete physical information of the problem .    in order to explain how to construct gauge invariants in this hamiltonian setting",
    ", we will restrict the matter sector to the scalar field @xmath0 that we are considering . nonetheless , the generalization of the procedure to any other form of matter is straightforward .",
    "just for this section , let us denote by @xmath54 , for @xmath55 , the six independent components of the geometric perturbative variables @xmath56 .",
    "apart from those , we also have another perturbative degree of freedom corresponding to the matter field , which is described by the pair @xmath57 .",
    "the idea is essentially to make a canonical transformation from this set of perturbative variables to another new set @xmath58 , with the requirement that four of the new moments reproduce the constraints and : @xmath59 the subindex @xmath60 takes the values @xmath61 and we have defined , in order to have a compact notation for this section , @xmath62 . in this way , the four variables @xmath63 will be gauge - invariant , but constrained to vanish by equations ( [ perturbative_constraint1][perturbative_constraint2 ] ) , whereas their conjugate variables @xmath64 will be pure gauge , such that their initial value can be arbitrarily chosen .",
    "in addition , the evolution equations for these latter variables will contain the free functions @xmath30 and @xmath31 , since they will be obtained by variation of the action with respect to the linearized constraints ( [ exampleconst ] ) .",
    "this allows us to choose also the time derivatives of the pure - gauge variables @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , if one were able to follow this procedure explicitly , one would have isolated the non - physical information ( gauge as well as constrained ) in the four pairs of conjugated variables @xmath65 .",
    "the remaining variables @xmath66 $ ] will be the so - called _ master variables _ , which are gauge - invariant and obey non - constrained equations of motion .",
    "these master variables are the two degrees of freedom of the gravitational wave and the matter degree of freedom , which contain all the physical information of the problem .",
    "the initial variables @xmath67 can be reconstructed in terms of the master variables in any gauge just by applying the inverse of the canonical transformation .",
    "examples of such master variables are the regge ",
    "wheeler @xcite and zerilli @xcite variables in schwarzschild backgrounds , as well as the generalization of the former one to dynamical spherical backgrounds @xcite ( see @xcite for explicit examples of the application of the described procedure for spherical backgrounds ) . in cosmological backgrounds , the decomposition into scalar , vector , and tensor quantities is usually performed @xcite . in this decomposition , the gravitational degrees of freedom are encoded into the tensorial sector and they are automatically gauge - invariant because they do not appear in the perturbative constraints ( [ perturbative_constraint1][perturbative_constraint2 ] ) .",
    "( note that the constraints form a four - dimensional vector field and its decomposition gives rise to two scalar and two vector degrees of freedom , but no tensor components . ) for a matter sector given by a scalar field , the gauge - invariant mukhanov ",
    "sasaki variable @xcite , see below , can be defined by following the described procedure @xcite .",
    "a different technique , inspired by hamilton  jacobi theory , which leads to the same result for such a cosmological background , can be found in @xcite .",
    "once the constraints at the linearized level are trivialized , one can either solve them classically by imposing the four moments @xmath68 to be vanishing or quantize them .",
    "the quantization would just tell us , through equations ( [ quantum_constraint1][quantum_constraint2 ] ) , that the wave function must be independent of the position variables @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "therefore , only equations ( [ ham_constraint][diff_constraint2 ] ) will have to be considered .",
    "furthermore , in spatially homogeneous backgrounds , as the one that will be considered in this paper , by choosing adapted coordinates with a vanishing shift function @xmath70 , the background diffeomorphism constraint ( [ eq_back2 ] ) is exactly obeyed and equation ( [ diffconstraint2 ] ) , and thus its quantum version ( [ diff_constraint2 ] ) , do not appear in this case [ see ( [ total_hamiltonian ] ) ] .",
    "thus , by constructing gauge - invariant variables at the classical level following the commented procedure , only the hamiltonian constraint ( [ ham_constraint ] ) will have to be solved at the quantum level .",
    "the total gauge - invariant hamiltonian will take the following form : @xmath71 where @xmath72 will be the ( spatially integrated ) hamiltonian corresponding to the background spacetime , see ( [ backgroundh ] ) below , while @xmath73 and @xmath74 will be the hamiltonians of the scalar , see ( [ eq : hamilton ] ) , and tensorial , see ( [ h_tensors ] ) , perturbative degrees of freedom , respectively .",
    "the quantization of this constraint will lead to ( [ ham_constraint ] ) , which , for our specific model , will take the explicit form given in ( [ eq : wdwmaster ] ) .",
    "this equation will be called the master wheeler  dewitt equation and the main objective of this paper will be to solve it within a semiclassical born ",
    "oppenheimer approach ; therein , will emerge as an approximate equation .    here",
    ", two comments are in order .",
    "on the one hand , note that the procedure described in this section , which was also similarly employed in @xcite , only takes into account the perturbative degrees of freedom .",
    "we are assuming that the time derivatives of the background variables that appear during the process should be replaced by making use of the background equations of motion .",
    "this is sufficient for our approach since , as will be explained below , for the background objects that appear inside @xmath73 and @xmath74 , their classical behavior will be considered .",
    "if one wishes to perform a more fundamental quantization , without making use of the background equations of motion , it would be necessary to complete the above - mentioned canonical transformation to the background degrees of freedom by correcting them with quadratic terms in the perturbations along the lines presented in @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , note that both procedures would lead to the same hamiltonian .    on the other hand ,",
    "the construction of the master gauge - invariant objects , and their corresponding hamiltonian , is quite involved and has already been performed in @xcite for the background spacetime that we will be interested in .",
    "since we already know which are the canonical variables , it is thus possible to use a reduced action approach @xcite , as originally performed in @xcite , where the constraints are solved and used to simplify the action , to obtain the hamiltonian ( [ total_gi_ham ] ) .",
    "this will be explicitly presented in the next section in order to clarify our notation and assumptions .",
    "in this section , the formalism explained in the previous section will be applied to the study of an inflationary universe with tiny perturbations that are interpreted as the seeds for structure formation in the universe and , hence , are in particular responsible for the anisotropies of the cmb . in our model ,",
    "the inflationary phase is caused by a scalar _ inflaton _ field that only varies slightly with time .",
    "we consider scalar and tensor perturbations of the metric , as well as perturbations of the scalar field .",
    "the resulting wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation is then the starting point to calculate the power spectra of scalar and tensor perturbations by using a semiclassical approximation .",
    "we start by formulating the wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation for a flat friedmann",
    " lematre  robertson  walker ( flrw ) universe with spatial topology .",
    "this plays the role of our background spacetime , on which the perturbations are formulated .",
    "but we emphasize that , as described in the previous section and contrary to the usual approach of quantum field theory on fixed backgrounds , this background will also be treated dynamically with quantum degrees of freedom .",
    "we restrict ourselves to a flat universe , because the exponential expansion during the inflationary phase flattens any curvature of the universe sufficiently fast . in terms of the conformal time @xmath75 , which is fixed by choosing the lapse function as @xmath76 , @xmath77 being the scale factor , the line element of such a universe reads",
    "s^2 = a^2()(-^2 + ^2 ) . as usual , the relation between this conformal time and the cosmic time @xmath52 is given by @xmath78 .",
    "as mentioned above , we introduce a massive minimally coupled scalar field @xmath0 with potential @xmath79 , which plays the role of the inflaton , and we neglect a cosmological constant .",
    "the action for such a model takes the form [ sincll ] s = ^3 . here and in the following ,",
    "derivatives with respect to @xmath75 are denoted using primes . for completeness ,",
    "let us include explicitly the equations of motion , which are easily obtained from this action : @xmath80 in , we have introduced an arbitrary length scale @xmath81 that appears when performing the integration over the volume . in order not to explicitly denote this length scale in the following ,",
    "we rescale the scale factor and conformal time as follows , which is similar to the replacement carried out in @xcite , [ repl1 ] a _ = a _ , _ = . after this replacement ,",
    "the scale factor @xmath77 has the dimension of a length , while @xmath75  as well as the spatial variables  become dimensionless . hence , we can effectively set the length scale @xmath81 appearing in to one .",
    "however , later in our discussions of possible observational consequences of our results , we will restore @xmath81 . with this replacement ,",
    "the hamiltonian for our ` background universe ' reads as follows : [ backgroundh ]",
    "^0h = -_a^2 + _ ^2 + a^4 ( ) , where @xmath82 and @xmath83 . the canonical quantization of this hamiltonian is carried out using the laplace ",
    "beltrami factor ordering @xcite , which guarantees that the kinetic term remains invariant under transformations in configuration space .",
    "consequently , we obtain the following wheeler  dewitt equation for the background : _ 0(a , ) = 0 .",
    "[ wdw_raw_c5 ] we simplify this equation by introducing the dimensionless quantity @xmath84 , which is defined in terms of a reference scale factor @xmath85 as [ alpha ] : = ( ) .",

    "can be combined into _",
    "one _ gauge - invariant master scalar which is sufficient to fully describe the scalar perturbations @xcite .",

    ", @xmath93 , which is defined by [ eq : defbardeen ] _ b ( , ) : = a+ ^. note that @xmath93 is dimensionless .",
    "on top of the metric perturbations , we also need to consider fluctuations @xmath94 of the scalar inflaton field @xmath95 , which can be represented in a gauge - invariant way as ^()(,):= + ^(b - e^ ) .",
    "the quantities @xmath93 and @xmath96 can be combined to a single master gauge - invariant quantity , the so - called _ mukhanov  sasaki variable _",

    ", the field @xmath97 obeys a klein  gordon equation on a minkowski background . in quantum field",
    "theory on classical backgrounds , this is the way one always writes the action , such that one can impose the usual definition of the creation and annihilation operators , with their canonical commutation relations and the usual klein ",
    "gordon inner product @xcite .",
    "apart from this , there are two other arguments in favor of introducing the variable .",
    "first , the employed re - scaling with @xmath77 in ( [ mukhdef ] ) is also crucial in describing the quantum - to - classical transition by the process of decoherence : it has been shown that the divergence occurring in the decoherence factor can successfully be regularized when using this re - scaling @xcite .",
    "second , this re - scaling allows for a unitary implementation of the quantum dynamics when the perturbations are treated for quantum field theory in curved spacetime in the fock picture @xcite .    in order to obtain the action for the variable @xmath97",
    ", one has to expand the einstein ",
    "hilbert action plus the scalar field action up to the second order in the perturbations around a flrw background , and one ends up with the scalar part of the second variation of the action @xcite [ eq : action ] ^2 s= . here",
    ", @xmath101 is a shorthand notation for [ defz ] z:=a , where we have used the first slow - roll parameter [ defepsilon ] : = - = 1- .",
    "the fraction @xmath102 is therefore in the general case a complicated expression that contains up to fourth - order @xmath75-derivatives of the background variables @xmath0 and @xmath77 .",
    "given that we are dealing here with a full theory of quantum gravity , where the background is quantized as well , we would therefore in principle also have to replace the @xmath75-derivatives appearing in this fraction , which will become canonical momenta in the respective hamiltonian , by derivatives with respect to @xmath77 and @xmath0 in the process of quantization .",
    "it is , however , a feature of the semiclassical ( born  oppenheimer ) approximation in quantum cosmology that the minisuperspace momenta can be approximated , at the used order , by derivatives of the minisuperspace variables @xcite .",
    "therefore , we will use the classical expressions for @xmath102 , which leads to a drastic simplification when considering the de sitter and slow - roll cases .",
    "since we are working in the realm of linear perturbation theory , we assume that each mode of the perturbations evolves independently , which allows us to perform a fourier transform of the variable @xmath97 as follows : [ eq : tfv ] v(,)= _ ^3 v _ ( ) ^ .",
    "the wave vector @xmath103 that appears in this equation and its modulus @xmath104 are related to a respective wave length _ without _ including the factor @xmath105 , such that the relation between @xmath106 and its wave length @xmath107 is simply given by k = l^-1 .",
    "we assume that @xmath97 is real , such that the relation @xmath108 holds .",
    "the action takes the following form after applying the fourier transform and taking the integral over the spatial volume : [ eq : actionfourier ] ^2 s= ^3",
    "v_^^+v_v_^*. in order to later be able to analyze each mode separately , that is , to have a separate wheeler  dewitt equation for each mode , we have to replace the integral over the wave vector @xmath103 by a sum .",
    "this can be justified if one uses , as we do here , a compact spatial topology .",
    "in order to implement this formally , we introduce an arbitrary length scale @xmath81 , with respect to which the wave modes are discretized , in the following way ( see e.g. @xcite , appendix ) [ inttodiscr ] ^3 \\",
    "{ } _ \\{}. here a comment is in order .",
    "both the equations of motion for the perturbations and the initial data that we will later consider will only depend on the module @xmath106 .",

    "therefore , as commented above , we construct the de sitter universe by setting the scalar field @xmath0 to a constant value . using the vanishing of the background hamiltonian , and neglecting the time derivative of @xmath0",

    "one has to choose a specific potential , e.g.  @xmath208 , such that @xmath209 , but we will refrain from doing this in order to keep our considerations as general as possible .",

    "@xmath141 take the same form for both scalar and tensor perturbations , [ omkds ] ^2_k ( ) = k^2 - , such that we can consider both kinds of perturbations in one step up to the calculation of the power spectra .",
    "now we can insert these relations into the equations obtained in the semiclassical approximation presented in section [ sectsemi ] and from the gaussian ansatz applied in section [ sectgauss ] .    setting @xmath0 to a constant value",

    "its solution can be easily obtained and reads [ solhj ] s_0()= -^3h_0 , where we have chosen the minus sign , which corresponds to an expanding universe .",
    "this is then also reflected in the definition of the wkb conformal time , given here by = ^h_0 .",
    "this choice recovers the standard flux of time , that is , @xmath75 growing with @xmath84 , and thus can be directly identified with the classical conformal time .    considering the derivations presented in sections [ sectgaussa ] and [ sectps ] , we have seen that in order to obtain the power spectra , we just need to find a solution for @xmath187 from equation , which , for this particular case , is given by [ dglom0 ] _",

    "on the other hand , for the case of the equation with only the real part of @xmath191 , @xmath232 turns out to be an oscillating function with a constant amplitude .",
    "more precisely , it oscillates around k+ , with an amplitude of @xmath234 . in this way ,",
    "the minima of @xmath232 coincide with the value of @xmath235 , which at early times is equal to @xmath106 .",
    "this oscillatory behavior , with a constant amplitude and a minimum given by @xmath235 is obeyed all along until very small values of @xmath75 ( see fig .",
    "[ omegaearly ] ) .",
    "in fact , for large negative values of @xmath75 , the explained behavior could be expected beforehand due to the specific initial data we requested , which is to have an almost vanishing derivative at initial time at a value equal to @xmath230 . requesting an almost zero time derivative at the initial point imposes that such point should be a minimum and thus fixes the amplitude of the oscillations .",
    "therefore , this amplitude should , in principle , not be regarded as physically meaningful since we are imposing it by hand .    as for the behavior of the numerical solution for @xmath236",
    ", we find that both solutions follow the same qualitative behavior as @xmath235 , but they differ quantitatively , which implies a correction in the spectrum . in subsection [ linearizedsection ] , by making use of the linearized version of the equation for @xmath237",
    ", we will compute quantitatively such a correction .",
    "as has been commented above , the behavior of the @xmath237 will be highly dependent on the chosen initial conditions .",

    "davies vacuum is regarded as the initial physically meaningful state .",
    "the idea behind the bunch ",
    "davies vacuum is that at the beginning , when each mode is well inside its hubble horizon , it is oscillating with a constant frequency @xmath106 .",
    "this means that @xmath239 and therefore @xmath240 .",
    "following the same argumentation , in the corrected case , we should try to find a frequency that makes the real part of @xmath237 equal to a constant @xmath241 ( which would stand for the frequency of the free modes ) , whereas its imaginary part is vanishing . in this way",
    ", we would find that the mode function would be a freely oscillating function @xmath242 . by writing explicitly the equation of motion for @xmath243 and @xmath244 from ( [ omegaeq ] ) ,",
    "@xmath245 it is easy to see that this can only be achieved if the imaginary part of @xmath192 ( the unitarity - violating part ) is vanishing and initially ( @xmath246 ) @xmath247 . from the explicit form of the corrected frequencies given in",
    ", we can compute the value of its real part at an initial time @xmath246 , _",

    "for such a purpose , we expand our solution for @xmath266 , which leads to ^(1 ) _ - .",
    "from there , it is straightforward to see that one should set @xmath267 in order to select the only non - oscillatory solution .",

    "the magnitude of the effect can be estimated by the fact that the tensor - to - scalar ratio of the inflationary perturbations is related to the energy scale of inflation ( cf .",

    "we shall discuss the issue of the observability of the corrections in more detail in the follow - up paper .    in the de sitter case ,",

    "making use of a semiclassical born  oppenheimer type of approximation to the wheeler  dewitt equation , quantum - gravitational effects on scalar and tensor perturbations during inflation have been computed .",
    "we have found that these effects , described by correction terms to the usual schrdinger equation for the perturbative modes , lead to an _ enhancement of power _ on the largest scales for both scalar and tensor perturbations .",
    "let us briefly compare the present results with the results found earlier . in ref .",
    "@xcite , only perturbations of the scalar field were considered , whereas the perturbations of the metric were neglected .",
    "there a suppression of power was found . nonetheless , in ref .",
    "@xcite it was pointed out that the considered differential equation , with the imposed boundary condition , actually allows for two solutions , one of them becoming discontinuous in some limit . choosing the continuous solution , one finds , in fact , an enhancement of power .",
    "we now outline the main differences of the present analysis as compared to @xcite .",
    "first of all , we have incorporated tensor perturbations in our discussion and have dealt with the perturbative gauge invariance for the scalar sector by constructing the corresponding gauge - invariant master variable , that is , the mukhanov ",
    "sasaki variable .",
    "this allows us to perform a reduced phase space quantization .",
    "besides , we have used a different method to implement the gaussian form of the corrected wave function",
    ". additionally , we have not a priori neglected the explicitly imaginary terms in the quantum - gravitationally corrected schrdinger equation .",
    "in fact , the full solution of this equation has been numerically analyzed and several physically non - desirable properties produced by the imaginary terms have been found .",
    "furthermore , we have discussed the natural initial conditions to be imposed when solving the corrected schrdinger equation , and have defined a modified bunch  davies - like initial quantum state .",
    "finally , this initial state has been used to obtain the numerical solution of with all unitarity - violating terms removed , as well as the analytic solution of the linearized equation that gave us the explicit correction to the power spectra .",
    "an important point is the use of the mukhanov ",
    "sasaki variable @xmath97 as defined in .",
    "this variable invokes , in particular , a re - scaling with respect to the scale factor @xmath77 .",
    "such a re - scaling has no effect in the classical theory , but it is relevant in quantum cosmology where @xmath77 is quantized .",
    "the quantum theory is , in fact , not invariant with respect to field re - definitions .",
    "the use of @xmath97 is a preferred one , among other reasons , because it allows a physical regularization of decoherence factors @xcite .",
    "we thus believe that this is the correct variable to use also in the present context .    in the alternative method to implement the born ",
    "oppenheimer approximation to the wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation that was advocated in @xcite , an enhancement of power was found for the de sitter case @xcite , whereas the analysis of the slow - roll case led to a loss of power for the scalar modes , while the tensor modes remained enhanced @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors adopted the point of view that they can fit the _ observed _ loss of power by their results if they take the reference scale to be much smaller than the pivot scale ; they give a value of @xmath275 somewhat smaller than 2 mpc , which corresponds to the scale of galaxy clusters .",
    "whether such a small scale turns out to become relevant in quantum gravity , is so far an open , yet intriguing , question .",
    "we note that in all the above - cited papers , including the present one , the quantum - gravitational correction term is proportional to @xmath278 and thus violates the ( approximate ) scale invariance .",
    "such a @xmath278-dependence was already found in @xcite .    in loop quantum cosmology",
    ", there are several approaches available to discuss quantum - gravitational corrections @xcite . in some of them , also an enhancement of power was found ; a summarized discussion is given , for instance , in @xcite .",
    "in general , loop quantum cosmology models contain more free parameters that need to be constrained than the present approach .",
    "the method that most resembles ours is the one outlined in @xcite , and concrete calculations leading to a suppression of power on large scales for scalar perturbations can be found in @xcite .",
    "apart from loop quantum cosmology , an application of supersymmetric quantum cosmology to such a situation would also be of interest @xcite .    in our follow - up paper",
    ", we shall apply the methods presented here to the more realistic slow - roll case , which will allow us to discuss the issue of observability more precisely .",
    "it can , however , already be said that an effect of the order of @xmath279 on large scales can not be seen in the cmb anisotropies , because of the statistical uncertainty implied by cosmic variance , which is also most prominent on large scales .",
    "it remains to be seen whether the magnitude of the correction turns out to be larger in some alternative , but still observationally justified , inflationary model .",
