    "massive gravity is a theory of a massive spin-2 graviton , a generalization from the einstein gravity which corresponds to the massless graviton .",
    "the linearized massive gravity was constructed by fierz and pauli @xcite by adding an interaction term into the linearlized einstein - hilbert action .",
    "however , the fierz - pauli theory suffers from the disagreement between the predictions made from the massless limit of the theory and those made from the general relativity , which was proposed by van dam , veltman , and zakharov ( known as vdvz discontinuity ) @xcite .",
    "the solution to the discontinuity was clarified by vainshtein @xcite , that the linear approximation breaks down for the massless limit of the theory and then such discontinuity can be lifted in non - linear theory of massive gravity .",
    "the cost of the non - linear generalization is the existence of the ghostly sixth degree of freedom , the boulware - deser ( bd ) ghost @xcite .",
    "the ghost free generalization of massive gravity , the so - called drgt massive gravity , was successfully constructed by de rham , gabadadze , and tolley @xcite which the suitable interaction terms are chosen such that there exists no bd ghost in the theory .    in order to investigate the cosmological implication of the drgt massive gravity , it is convenient to use the friedman - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) metric as the physical metric .",
    "it was found that the drgt massive gravity does not admit flat and closed flrw solution @xcite while the self - accelerating open flrw solutions were found in @xcite .",
    "a more general issue on the model was investigated by replacing the minkowski fiducial metric with a de sitter or flrw fiducial metric @xcite .",
    "it was found that the model admits not only open but also flat and closed flrw solutions and one of the solutions provides the self - accelerating expansion of the late - time universe .",
    "although the drgt theory succeeds in providing the self - accelerating solution for the universe , the number of propagating degrees of freedom in the theory is not correct for the cosmological solution . basically in four - dimensional spacetime , there are 5 degrees of freedom for the massive gravity while there are only 2 propagating degrees of freedom if the cosmological friedman - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) solution is assumed @xcite .",
    "moreover , de felice , gumrukcuoglu and mukohyama @xcite found that in the flrw limit of the anisotropic solutions of the drgt massive gravity , there is a non - bd ghost instability .",
    "this suggests the motivation for modifications on the drgt massive gravity in order to cover the viable cosmological solutions .",
    "one of possibilities to obtain a viable cosmological model of massive gravity is that , one may generalize the drgt theory by breaking the isotropy and study the anisotropic solution @xcite .",
    "an alternative possibility can be obtained by introducing new degrees of freedom along with its coupling to the massive graviton .",
    "for example , one can promote the graviton mass to be a function of an extra scalar field , the so - called mass - varying massive gravity @xcite .",
    "one can also multiply a fiducial metric with the conformal factor depending on an extra scalar field @xcite .",
    "the action of this extended drgt massive gravity is invariant under quasidilaton global symmetry and then known as the quasidilaton drgt massive gravity .",
    "unfortunately , it was found that the self - accelerating solutions of the model are always plagued by ghost instability @xcite .",
    "thus , the quasidilaton massive gravity is further extended in order to avoid the ghost instability by introducing a coupling between the quasidilaton scalar field and st@xmath0ckelberg fields while the quasidilaton symmetry is still preserved @xcite .",
    "it was also found that this extension can provide the correct number of degrees of freedom in the theory .",
    "it also was found that the effect of gravitational wave in quasidilaton massive gravity can be made larger than the hubble parameter leading to an explanation of the suppression of the power spectrum in cosmic microwave background @xcite .",
    "recently , another possible way to obtain viable model of massive gravity is that the extension of drgt massive gravity by introducing nontrivial coupling to the matter field @xcite .",
    "another interesting extended massive gravity theory is dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) massive gravity @xcite .",
    "this extension is obtained by introducing dbi scalar field into the theory through the coupling term in such a way that the scalar possesses generalized galileon shift symmetries @xcite . like original drgt massive gravity",
    ", it was shown that the model does not admit flat and closed flrw solutions as well as the number of degrees of freedom is still not correct @xcite .",
    "this may occur from using the minkowski fiducial metric .",
    "similarly to the original drgt massive gravity , one may consider the generalized version of the fiducial metric in order to obtain the solutions which admit the flat and closed flrw universe .",
    "since the flat minkowski fiducial metric in dbi massive gravity is motivated from the induced metric from brane world scenario , it is worthwhile to put a more general induced metric in consideration . in this work ,",
    "we consider the extended drgt massive gravity in which the fiducial metric is obtained from the induced metric of the brane moving in five - dimensional schwarzschild - anti - de - sitter ( schwarzschild - ads ) spacetime @xcite .",
    "it is found that the model not only admits the open but also flat and closed flrw universe .",
    "the background solutions can be divided into two branches ; a self - accelerating branch and a normal branch . for the self - accelerating branch , the graviton mass will play the role of the cosmological constant to drive the late - time expansion of the universe .",
    "for the normal branch , the general solutions are complicated and it is not easy to obtain the analytical solutions . to extract some information of this branch , we consider a specific class of the solutions and found that they can also provide the late - time expansion of the universe .",
    "the cosmological perturbations of the model are expanded around these background solutions .",
    "the results of cosmological perturbations in flat flrw universe is that there are no ghost in the linear level while the number degree of freedom is still not correct in the self - accelerating branch . for the normal branch",
    ", there has the correct number of degrees of freedom but the ghost instability always presents in the theory , at least at small scale .",
    "this problem may be alleviated by introducing the coupling term similar to one in the generalized quasidilaton massive gravity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : eom ] , we present the setup of the model and find the background solutions . in section [ sec : pert ] the cosmological perturbations are analyzed in order to find whether the number of the degrees of freedom in the theory is correct and whether there is a ghost among them . finally , we summarize the results in section [ sec : con ] .",
    "in this section , we will consider drgt massive gravity including dbi galileon term as follows @xmath1 + 2 m^2_g ( \\mathcal{l}_2[g,\\bar{g } ] + \\alpha_3\\mathcal{l}_3[g,\\bar{g } ] + \\alpha_4\\mathcal{l}_4[g,\\bar{g } ] ) \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\qquad- \\lambda^4 \\int d^4 x \\sqrt{-\\bar{g } } , \\label{action1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the physical metric which defines the measurement on the spacetime and @xmath3 is the fiducial metric introduced to construct nontrivial nonlinear interaction terms in massive gravity .",

    "this leads to the condition to avoid ghost such that @xmath164 .",
    "this condition is in conflict with the condition from the vector mode in which @xmath165 . as a result ,",
    "the ghost degree of freedom always exist in this branch at small scale ( either in vector modes or in one of scalar modes ) .",
    "for the other mode of scalar perturbations , one can find the result by substituting @xmath166 and @xmath167 at small scale into @xmath168 . as a result",
    ", we found that @xmath168 is always negative implying that , at least , one of scalar mode is always ghost .",
    "it is important to note that the leading term of @xmath162 is proportional to @xmath169 leading to @xmath170 when we take @xmath171 .",
    "this behavior occurs only in the particular solutions we choose to consider since the leading term , corresponding to @xmath172 , is proportional to @xmath173 .",
    "this suggests that the contributions from linear perturbations are very small .",
    "therefore non - linear perturbations may have nontrivial contributions and the conclusion of our results may change when non - linear perturbations are taken into account .",
    "in this work , we have considered the extended dbi massive gravity by generalizing the fiducial metric . in the original version of dbi massive gravity , the fiducial metric is in minkowski form .",
    "it was found that the flat and closed solutions for flrw metric are not admitted .",
    "moreover , the number of degrees of freedom of the massive graviton is not correct .",
    "the flat minkowski fiducial metric in dbi massive gravity plays the role of the induced metric on the brane . in the present work ,",
    "we generalize the fiducial metric by considering the induced metric corresponding to a domain wall moving in five - dimensional schwarzschild - ads spacetime .    from background equations",
    ", we found that the solutions not only admit open geometry of flrw metric but also flat and closed geometry .",
    "moreover , the solutions can be divided into two branches ; self - accelerating branch and normal branch . for self - accelerating branch",
    ", the graviton mass plays the role of cosmological constant to drive the late - time acceleration of the universe .",
    "we found that the hubble parameter @xmath78 is always constant and does not depend on function @xmath79 which characterizes the form of the fiducial metric .",
    "therefore , the dynamics of the universe are not controlled by the property of the fiducial metric .",
    "furthermore , the dbi scalar field has no contribution to the solutions in this branch .",
    "this is not so surprising since such contribution to the gravity sector must be introduced by the minimal coupling between the scalar and the massive graviton like in the mass - varying massive gravity and quasi - dilaton massive gravity . in order to investigate the number of degrees of freedom of the theory , we performed cosmological perturbations around this background solutions . from the tensor modes ,",
    "we have explored the conditions to avoid the tachyonic instability , @xmath174 , while the ghost and gradient instabilities are absent . by using this condition together with consistent conditions , @xmath116 and @xmath175",
    ", we found that there are allowed regions in @xmath176 space in both @xmath119 and @xmath120 solutions as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : self - acc ] . by including the investigation of vector and scalar modes",
    ", we found that the number of degrees of of freedom is not correct .",
    "there are only two degrees of freedom for gravity sector contributed from tensor modes while the contribution from vector and scalar modes vanish .",
    "this inconsistency is similar to the drgt massive gravity and dbi massive gravity .    for the solutions in normal branch ,",
    "the equations of motion are complicated and it is not easy to obtain the analytical solutions .",
    "therefore , the solutions in this branch are quite lack of investigation in literature .",
    "this is not only due to complicated equations but also the solutions generally do not provide an accelerated expansion of the universe . in the present work ,",
    "we restrict our attention to a particular class of the solution in order to simplify the calculation and also to capture some significant behaviors of the solutions .",
    "a characteristic constraint of this class of the solutions is @xmath177 .",
    "we found that this class of the solutions also provides the accelerating expansion of the universe like in self - accelerating branch inferred from the definition of effective energy density @xmath42 and the effective pressure @xmath48 in eqs .",
    "( [ eom n ] ) and ( [ eom a ] ) respectively . even though the solutions in this class provide the same accelerated expansion of the universe like the solutions in self - accelerating branch , these solutions are different since the solutions in this branch depend on the effect of dbi scalar field via the coupling @xmath91 . by setting the coupling @xmath125 to simplify the solutions , the allowed regions plotted by using conditions @xmath116 , @xmath126 and @xmath174 are explored .",
    "moreover , we also found that the graviton mass in this branch coincides with the effective mass investigated by using de sitter and flrw fiducial metric in drgt massive gravity @xcite .",
    "this effective mass is constrained by higuchi bound as @xmath128 .",
    "we use this condition together with @xmath116 and @xmath126 to find the allowed region in @xmath176 space shown in fig [ fig : normal ] . by using the investigation of the perturbation in vector and scalar modes",
    ", we found that the number of degrees of freedom is correct .",
    "however , at small scale with @xmath178 , the conditions to avoid ghost instability from vector modes and scalar modes are in conflict implying that there exists at least one ghost degree of freedom .",
    "this investigation suggests that the extended model of dbi massive gravity in this way dose not provide a viable cosmological model to explain the late - time acceleration of the universe . in order to obtain a viable extended model of dbi massive gravity",
    ", one may introduce the coupling term similar to one in the generalized quasidilaton massive gravity or introduce the nontrivial coupling matter fields like in original drgt massive gravity .",
