    "since we last met in rome last year there has been progress in our understanding of deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) structure functions and the implications of new measurements in the context of global analyses and extraction of parton distribution functions ( pdf s ) .",
    "firstly there have been updates to two major experiments @xmath1 the muon - nucleon nmc collaboration at cern and the neutrino - iron ccfr collaboration at fermilab .",
    "the nmc @xcite has produced their final numbers for @xmath2 for proton and deuterium targets at 90 , 120 , 200 and 280 gev while the ccfr @xcite collaboration has implemented new energy calibrations to its analysis .",
    "the latter data are consistent with a greater value of @xmath3 than the previously reported value .",
    "finally there have been the first reported measurements from hera on the charm structure function @xmath4 @xcite which indicate that a substantial fraction of the total @xmath2 at hera comes from charm production .    on the theoretical side",
    ", progress has been made following improved treatments of heavy quark production in dis .",
    "why is this important ?",
    "from above we see that the component of @xmath2 is relatively large and so it is obviously important to have a consistent description of this component and to check this with boson - gluon fusion mechanisms . also if we are trying to understand the small @xmath5 behaviour of @xmath2 ( i.e. bfkl versus glap ) then the data force us to study small @xmath6 i.e. the region where we move through the charm threshold",
    "; so this should be understood .",
    "finally it is necessary to produce pdf s for charm and bottom flavours to insert into other processes such as jet production .",
    "large @xmath5 , high @xmath6 is where the excitement resides just now .",
    "can we be precise about the conventional background and estimate the uncertainty in the cross section around @xmath7 , @xmath8 ?",
    "i shall discuss this briefly .",
    "for some time it has been realised that in addition to resumming large logs in @xmath6 ( glap ) , there may be significant contributions arising from resumming potentially large logs in @xmath9 ( bfkl ) .",
    "the difficulty is to devise a theoretically consistent procedure of ` marrying ' the two in a practical way that confronts the data and tries to answer the question whether these data favour or disfavour the inclusion of the @xmath0 resummed terms . here",
    "there has been definite progress and i shall highlight a recent analysis by thorne @xcite .",
    "the two major providers of pdf s , cteq and mrs , continue to update their global analyses of dis and other processes . both are now attempting to include a theoretically improved treatment of charm and bottom and these treatments are discussed in the following section . in this section",
    "i will highlight some results emerging from these on - going analyses .",
    "lai and tung@xcite demonstrate the effect of including the variable flavour scheme ( vfns ) developed by aivazis _",
    "et al._@xcite ( acot ) based on their ealier work@xcite into the cteq analysis .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the previous treatment in cteq where charm evolved as a massless quark .",
    "the effect is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fighera ] .",
    "only a small change is observed as one changes from cteq4 m ( the massless evolution ) to the improved vfns procedure which is more noticeable at small @xmath5 .",
    "a comparison of the resulting pdf s at @xmath10 gev@xmath11 is shown in fig .",
    "[ figpdf ]    moreover , the quality of the resulting fit to the full @xmath2 is improved at low @xmath5 .",
    "the series of global analyses carried out by mrs has been updated .",
    "the new data from nmc@xcite and ccfr@xcite are included and the improved treatment of the heavy quark developed by martin _ et al._@xcite is used ( see next section ) . as with the previous mrs analysis@xcite a low value of the starting scale @xmath12 of 1 gev@xmath11",
    "this is mainly to reach as small @xmath5 as possible for the hera data@xcite for which a cut at @xmath13 gev@xmath11 is taken while the cut is at 2 gev@xmath11 for other dis data . in order to study the sensitivity to the value of @xmath3",
    ", the analysis is repeated at fixed values of @xmath3 over a wide range .",
    "the resulting values of the individual @xmath14 values for the dis data sets are shown in fig .",
    "[ chisq ] .    from the figure we see ( i ) that the hera@xcite data prefer a value of @xmath3 around 0.12 or so@xcite , ( ii ) that the updated nmc@xcite data also prefer this somewhat larger value and ( iii ) the re - analysed ccfr@xcite @xmath2 data _ strongly _ favour a value at the upper end .",
    "this leaves bcdms@xcite data as the one set which still favours a relatively low value of @xmath3 .",
    "but we should recall that these data are very precise and measure scaling violations in the large @xmath5 region where the determination of @xmath3 is insensitive to possible uncertainty of the gluon distribution .",
    "the resulting best value of @xmath3 which emerges from this overall global analysis is 0.118 and we show comparisons of the fit using this value with a selection of data .",
    "the small @xmath5 data comparison is shown in fig .",
    "[ smallx ] .",
    "the comparsion with the new nmc data is shown in fig .",
    "[ nmcfig ] .",
    "notice that points below @xmath15 gev@xmath11 , while shown in the figure , were not included in the fit .",
    "finally we show the comparison with the new data from ccfr@xcite on @xmath2 extracted from @xmath16 and @xmath17 interactions off an iron target in fig .",
    "[ ccfr2fig ] .    the failure to agree below @xmath5 of around 0.1",
    "is well known .",
    "basically these low @xmath5 data prefer not to have the shadowing corrections , observed in muon dis , applied . because of this conflict ( with the nmc data for example )",
    "ccfr @xmath2 below @xmath18 is dropped in the fit . comparing the curves and large @xmath5 data in fig .",
    "[ ccfr2fig ] one can see that the data prefer slightly stronger @xmath6 variation than that from using @xmath19 .",
    "much better consistency is found for @xmath20 across the entire @xmath6 , @xmath5 range .    in this analysis",
    ", the pdf s at @xmath12 are parametrised in the usual mrs@xcite way with @xmath21 and @xmath22 for the glue and sea as @xmath23 .",
    "the exponents @xmath24 and @xmath25 are not constrained and as in the previous analysis one finds that at such a low choice of @xmath26 gev@xmath11 @xmath25 is positive ( singular ) while @xmath24 comes out negative @xmath1 i.e ` valence - like ' gluon . the actual value of the exponent varies for different values of @xmath3 ( @xmath27 to @xmath28 ) but when @xmath6 reaches just 2 gev@xmath11 all the gluon pdf s are approximately ` flat ' , see fig .",
    "[ gluplot ] .    taking the fit with @xmath29 and evolving to @xmath30 gev@xmath11 yields pdf s which are extremely close to those shown in fig .",
    "so the different treatments of charm partons in the latest analyses of cteq and mrs actually lead to little numerical difference in the resulting pdf s .",
    "let us consider possible approaches to treating the charm production contribution to the structure function @xmath2 .",
    "the most simplistic approach is to assume that a probe of virtuality @xmath6 can resolve a charm quark pair in the proton sea when @xmath31 . since such pairs",
    "originate from fluctuations of the gluon field , @xmath32 , a perturbative treatment should be valid as long as @xmath33 . as @xmath6 increases , @xmath34 corrections to the standard glap evolution become less important , and the charm quark can be treated as a ( fourth ) massless quark .",
    "these ideas are embodied in the ` massless parton evolution ' ( mpe ) approach [ eq : a1 ] c(x , q^2 ) & = & 0 q^2 _ c^2 , + n_f & = & 3 + ( q^2 - _ c^2 ) p_qg , p_gg , _ 0 ,  , [ eq : nf ] where @xmath35 . the charm contribution to the structure function",
    "is then f_2^c(x , q^2 ) = x c(x , q^2 ) [ eq : a2 ] in lowest order .",
    "this is the approach adopted at nlo in the mrs and cteq global parton analyses , with @xmath36 chosen in the mrs analysis to achieve a satisfactory description of the emc @xmath4 data @xcite , while in the cteq analysis @xmath36 is set equal to @xmath37 .",
    "for example , in the mrs(a ) analysis @xcite it was found that @xmath38 gev@xmath11 and that this was to a good approximation equivalent to taking 2 c ( x , q_0 ^",
    "2 ) = ( x , q_0 ^ 2 ) [ eq : a3 ] with @xmath39 at the input scale @xmath40 gev@xmath11 .",
    "that is at the input scale , charm @xmath41 was found to have approximately the same shape as the total quark sea distribution @xmath42 , and moreover to form about 2% of its magnitude .    in nlo",
    "the charm structure function is given by f_2^c ( x , q^2 ) = _ x^1 dz [ eq : c1 ] the charm quark coefficient function in ( [ eq : c1 ] ) has the form c_c = c_c^(0 ) + c_c^(1 ) +  , [ eq : c2 ] while for the gluon we have c_g = c_g^(1 ) +  [ eq : c3 ] and this expression with the standard massless @xmath43 coefficient functions was used to calculate @xmath4 in the mpe approach .",
    "a procedure which takes a very different approach is to generate @xmath4 from photon - gluon fusion ( pgf ) @xcite alone . in this case , the charm pdf appearing in eq.([eq : c1 ] ) is identically zero everywhere but the gluon coefficient function involves the non - zero charm mass @xmath37 and is the well - known pgf cross section , i.e. @xmath44 with c_g^pgf ( z , q^2 ) = \\ { . +   + + . }",
    "( q^2 ( - 1 ) - 4m_c^2 ) .",
    "[ eq : pgf ] where @xmath45 is the velocity of one of the charm quarks in the photon - gluon centre - of - mass frame ^2 = 1 - .",
    "[ eq : beta ] the @xmath46 function in eq.([eq : pgf ] ) , @xmath47 , represents the @xmath48 production threshold , where @xmath49 is the c.m .",
    "its presence guarantees @xmath50 .",
    "the exact next - to - leading order corrections to the pgf structure function are known @xcite and recently @xcite an analysis has been used to perform @xmath51 resummation up to @xmath52 for @xmath53 .",
    "such an approach is of course not applicable in the threshold region @xmath54 .",
    "however for many purposes the pgf procedure is insufficient .",
    "if we consider the high @xmath6 limit of @xmath55 we get c_g^pgf \\ { z^2 + ( 1 - z)^2 } ( ) + 8z ( 1 - z ) - 1 [ eq : c16 ] as @xmath56 , which differs from the exact @xmath57 coefficient @xmath58 by the presence of @xmath59 in the argument of the logarithm .",
    "this is a signal of potentially large logs which should be resummed by glap evolution .",
    "thus at large @xmath6 we should include the charm quark as a parton in glap evolution .",
    "in fact we should be able to provide a charm pdf all the way down to the charm threshold in order to insert all relevant pdf s into calculations of other perturbative qcd processes .",
    "the goal therefore is to do this in a consistent way      here the procedure is to have no charm pdf below @xmath60 but for @xmath61 to have @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the splitting function @xmath64 evaluated with @xmath65 . below @xmath60 charm is produced solely by boson - gluon fusion as above and this is labelled the ` fixed flavour number ' scheme ( ffns ) .",
    "thus for @xmath66 we have an ope for the structure functions f = c_ffns ( , , _ s ( ^2 ) ) _ ffns ( _ s ( ^2 ) ) + ( ) [ eq : opeffns ] above @xmath60 we work in the ` variable flavour number ' scheme ( vfns ) with @xmath67 and write the ope f = c_vfns ( , _ s ( ^2 ) ) _ vfns ( , , _ s(^2 ) ) + ( ) [ eq : opevfns ] while the operators @xmath68 nominally depend on @xmath69 they can be chosen so that they _",
    "evolve _ according to @xmath65 rge s .",
    "thus in the vfns the @xmath69 dependence appears only in the _",
    "corrections_. the coefficients @xmath70 are simply the usual massless @xmath43 coefficients @xmath71 .",
    "the two schemes must be mutually consistent at all @xmath72 which implies ( from eqns.([eq : opeffns],[eq : opevfns ] ) ) that the @xmath52 contribution in eq.([eq : opevfns ] ) can be written in the form c ( ) _ ffns ( _ s ( ^2 ) ) + ( ) [ eq : js1 ] where @xmath73 is a coefficient which @xmath74 powers of @xmath75 .",
    "if we express the relation between the operators of the two schemes through a matrix @xmath76 , _ vfns = a ( , _ s(^2 ) ) _",
    "ffns(_s ) [ eq : js2 ] then , in particular , the charm pdf is determined purely in terms of the _ light _ parton pdf s @xmath1 principally the gluon distribution of course .",
    "the structure functions above @xmath60 can again be expressed in terms of the vfns operators but now up to @xmath77 corrections , f & = & _ vfns + ( ) + & = & c_acot ( , , _",
    "s ) _ vfns + ( ) [ eq : vfns1 ] where @xmath78 is the coefficient in the acot@xcite formalism which then depends on @xmath69 . thus in the acot formalism , while the partons obey a simple evolution ( independent of @xmath69 ) , the coefficients would have a complicated dependence on @xmath69 . from eqns ( [ eq : opeffns],[eq :",
    "vfns1 ] ) we obtain the relation between the coefficient functions c_acot ( , , _",
    "s ) = c_vfns ( , _ s ) + c ( ) a^-1 = c_ffns ( , , _",
    "s ) a^-1 [ eq : coeffs ] where the term @xmath79 on the rhs @xmath80 as @xmath81 .    buza _ et al._@xcite have evaluated the coefficient functions for @xmath53 in the vfns and the ffns to nlo .",
    "they find that for @xmath82 the two schemes agree very closely .",
    "the same authors have worked out the relation ( [ eq : js2 ] ) in the limit @xmath53 exactly through terms @xmath83 , @xmath84 and constants .",
    "this infers a matching of all the four flavour pdf s above the scale @xmath85 , to the three flavour pdf s below .",
    "again this is only for @xmath53 , which does not solve the problem of what to do at @xmath86 .",
    "so there has to be another matching between the calculated @xmath87 production cross section in the threshold region to the charm pdf prescription at @xmath88 . in leading order",
    "this is exactly the acot procedure .",
    "it remains to be investigated how to do this retaining terms @xmath34 at nlo .",
    "thus although the @xmath89 change of factorization scheme is very attractive in principle , a major problem arises when one tries to go down in @xmath6 ( still at nlo ) all the way to the charm threshold - retaining the @xmath79 term @xmath1 which is the eventual aim of acot .",
    "the @xmath90 term is the one which contains the subtraction in the gluon coefficient functions for @xmath91 in eq.([eq : a2 ] ) to avoid double counting which at lo is quite straightforward and takes the form @xmath92 the effect of this is that @xmath93 is described at low @xmath6 by pgf but as @xmath94 by the evolved charm pdf .",
    "since the way it has been formulated is only at _ leading order _ ( the charm pdf evolves only via @xmath95 )",
    "this allows the standard expression to be used for the gluon coefficient function .",
    "we are still left with the problem of how to evolve _ all _ the pdf s beyond l.o .",
    "- in the @xmath43 scheme say . while the splitting functions will continue to have the @xmath65 forms , the entire @xmath96 dependence is put into the coefficient functions which will make them ( the light parton coefficient functions as well as the charm coefficient functions ) extremely complicated when they are eventually computed .      in view of the practical difficulties of implementing the acot procedure at nlo , ryskin and mrs@xcite",
    "introduce an alternative prescription which is consistent at all orders but which generates partons which may be used with the _ conventional _ @xmath43 coefficient functions .",
    "the charm quark evolution is modified however @xmath1 of course only for @xmath53 does it evolve according to the massless @xmath43 .",
    "the modified splitting function is derived by studying the leading log decomposition of the feynman diagrams and takes the form p^(0)_cg ( z , ) & = & ( q^2-m_c^2 ) + p^(1)_cg ( z , ) & = & p^(1)_qg ( z ) _ m=0 , [ eq : mrrs1 ]    thus as @xmath53 , @xmath97 in the @xmath43 scheme .",
    "the nlo splitting function obtained from the ladder graph actually has a natural scale given by @xmath98 .",
    "this choice was not the one chosen when the @xmath43 scheme was set up ; instead the scale @xmath99 was chosen and it is the latter scale which leads to the expression in eq.([eq : mrrs1 ] ) .",
    "the ` natural ' choice of scale would have the advantage that it can be interpreted as corresponding to a ` resolution threshold ' of @xmath100 below which @xmath6 is too small to allow sufficient time to observe the @xmath64 fluctuations . to avoid double counting the gluon coefficient function for",
    "@xmath93 must have a subtraction term , i.e. c^(1)_g ( z , ) = c^pgf_g ( z , ) - c_g ( z , ) [ eq : mrrs2 ] where c_g ( z , ) ~^q^2_m_c^2 p^(0)_cg ( z , ) ( q^2 ) [ eq : mrrs3 ]    this subtraction ensures the required cancellation of the leading contribution to the charm quark evolution around @xmath86 , but the nlo contribution from the @xmath101 term is still significant . however inserting the condition that the natural scale should really be @xmath102 into the charm quark coefficient function forces the low @xmath6 description of @xmath93 to be given entirely by the pgf term .",
    "the resulting description of the measured @xmath93 cross sections is remarkably successful - see fig .",
    "[ figmrrs ] .",
    "because of the topical interest in the magnitude of the cross section at large @xmath5 and large @xmath6 it is worthwhile to study the precision by which we believe we understand the conventional dis cross section .",
    "this translates into estimating our confidence in the large @xmath5 pdf s . in fig .",
    "[ figx45 ] we show the electromagnetic contribution to @xmath2 at @xmath103 . for @xmath104 gev@xmath11 the data have a normalisation uncertainty of about 3@xmath105 . taking the pdf s from the latest global analyses together with a generous uncertainty in the value of @xmath3 @xmath1 from 0.110 to 0.125 we see that this gives an additional 7@xmath105 to the extrapolated value at @xmath106 gev@xmath11 . including the standard interference term with the weak neutral current the resulting cross section for @xmath107 in the region of the observed excess at hera",
    "is then determined to within about 10@xmath105 .",
    "so far i have discussed fits using lo and nlo resummation of large @xmath108 terms .",
    "now we should ask is this really good enough when , at hera , we explore @xmath5 below @xmath109 , i.e. @xmath110 , and the bfkl resummation of @xmath111 terms i.e. @xmath112 should somehow be included .",
    "catani and hautmann@xcite , by incorporating @xmath113factorisation into the collinear factorisation framework , calculated the relevant anomalous dimensions to lowest order in @xmath114 for each power of @xmath115 and similarly for the coefficient functions .",
    "this prompted attempts to calculate structure functions within the conventional r.g .",
    "framework but including the leading @xmath115 terms .",
    "comparisons with data suggested no improvement over fits with soft inputs and without @xmath115 resummation @xcite and indeed could worsen the agreement with data .",
    "furthermore there was a strong dependence on the choice of factorisation scheme in which the leading @xmath111 terms were included@xcite .",
    "the key to incorporating the resummation contributions is to derive an expansion for the structure functions which is leading order in both @xmath115 _ and _ @xmath116 and which is renormalisation scheme consistent .",
    "thorne@xcite has shown that this automatically leads to results which are factorisation scheme invariant and provides a framework in which the ` physical ' anomalous dimensions of catani@xcite emerge naturally .",
    "this framework is discussed more fully in thorne s talk@xcite .",
    "there is a decided improvement in the description of the @xmath2 data as a result of including the @xmath115 contributions in this theoretically consistent manner , especially at small @xmath5 .",
    "fig.[thornefig ] shows a comparison with the low @xmath5 data and such a fit demonstrating the better agreement at very low @xmath5 .",
    "perhaps the sharpest prediction of this approach is the behaviour of @xmath117 at small @xmath5 where the magnitude of the longitudinal structure function is much smaller than the ` conventional ' two loop prediction .",
    "indeed as a final note for this talk i would stress the importance of measuring directly @xmath118 at hera as a probe of dynamics of small @xmath5 physics .",
