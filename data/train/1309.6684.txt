    "in the conventional quark model , hadrons can be classified in two groups on the basis of their quark content : baryons , constituted by three quarks , and mesons , formed by a quark - antiquark pair .",
    "keeping this idea in mind , it was just a matter of time to build up the different baryons and mesons observed in nature within quark models .",
    "all one needed was to write all the possible combinations of three quarks or quark - antiquark pairs as a function of their charge and strangeness .",
    "radial and orbital excitations of these quarks from the ground state to different high energy levels could generate more hadrons having a relatively short lifetime , which are called resonances .",
    "however , this picture of the hadron resonances seems to be too simple to understand the properties of the different states present in nature .",
    "for example , the lowest excited state found of the nucleon is the @xmath12 .",
    "however , in a three - quark model for a baryon , the state @xmath13 is expected to be the first excitation of the nucleon , with a radial excitation of a quark . from the kinematical point of view",
    ", this implies providing an energy of around @xmath14 mev to one of the three quarks in the nucleon .",
    "this energy is sufficient to create , for example , a pion or two pions or an eta meson .",
    "therefore , it is plausible to think that to describe the properties of states as the ones mentioned above , the interaction of a pion and an nucleon , or an eta and a nucleon could be more crucial than the quark structure of the state .",
    "therefore , a theory which uses the hadrons as the degrees of freedom instead of quarks can be more useful to understand the properties of some of the meson and baryon resonances found in nature .",
    "this situation is in fact very much expected when one studies interactions of hadrons in a low and an intermediate energy region . here , due to the inherent confinement of the quarks ,",
    "these can not be considered as the asymptotic states of the theory .",
    "having this idea in mind , in the last years , non - perturbative unitarity techniques based on chiral lagrangians have been applied to the study of different meson - baryon and meson - meson systems , for example , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , etc . , and dynamical generation of many",
    "baryon and meson resonances has been found .",
    "for instance , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath13 , etc .",
    ", in the baryon sector and @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , etc .",
    ", in the meson sector @xcite .",
    "since the interaction in such two - body systems is strongly attractive , the addition of one more meson or baryon could further lead to the generation of new states in which case the interaction of the three hadrons could be determinant in understanding some of the experimental findings .    with the motivation to search for such states and to understand their properties , we have extended the well studied two - body chiral formalism to three - body systems .",
    "here , i summarize the method developed for the investigation of three hadron systems as well as the results found for the generation of resonances and/or bound states in @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 systems .",
    "a rigorous study of three - body systems requires solving the faddeev equations @xcite .  in this formalism",
    ", the @xmath27 matrix of the three - body system is written as sum of three partitions , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , i.e. ,    @xmath31    each of these partitions , @xmath32 , with @xmath33 , represents that contribution to the total @xmath27 matrix in which particles @xmath34 and @xmath35 , with @xmath36=1,2,3 , are the last ones in interacting .",
    "thus , particle @xmath37 is a spectator in the last interaction . in this way ,",
    "the summation of the three partitions in eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) accounts for the different permutations and combinations of the sequence of different pair interactions among the three particles .",
    "these partitions satisfy the faddeev equations : @xmath38,\\label{fa }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 denotes the @xmath40-matrix for that two body subsystem where particle @xmath37 is absent and @xmath41 is the three - body green s function for the system .    the solution of the faddeev equations in its exact form is a cumbersome task , due to which one often resorts to approximations . while most conventional studies of three - body systems use potentials in the momentum space , usually separable potentials to make the solution of the faddeev equations feasible , we used two particle @xmath40 matrices generated from the solution of the bethe - salpeter equation in its on - shell factorization form  @xcite : @xmath42 in our approach , the kernel @xmath43 present in eq .",
    "( [ bs ] ) is obtained from the lowest order chiral lagrangian describing the interaction between the particles and @xmath44 is the two - body loop function , divergent in nature and which is regularized using a natural cut - off or subtraction constant when using dimensional regularization  @xcite .",
    "equation  ( [ bs ] ) is solved in a coupled channel approach , generating in this way different hadron resonances where the hadron - hadron interaction is essential for understanding the properties of the states found .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the availability of more precise data in recent times is helping in constraining the parameters involved in the higher order terms of the chiral lagrangians , leading to more precise determination of observables  @xcite .",
    "the contribution of these higher order terms in the three - body calculation should be checked in the future .",
    "once the @xmath40 matrices are obtained by solving eq .",
    "( [ bs ] ) , we can proceed to solve eq .",
    "( [ fa ] ) .",
    "the faddeev equations are integral equations and the @xmath40 matrices which enter in the equations are off - shell .",
    "the interesting point of using chiral amplitudes for solving eq .",
    "( [ fa ] ) is that they can be split into two terms : one which is called on - shell , since it is calculated as a function of the mandelstam variable @xmath8 with the external particles on their mass shell , and other off - shell which goes as @xmath45 , with @xmath46 the momentum and @xmath47 the mass of the particle , and which vanishes when the external particles are on - shell .",
    "we found that when the chiral amplitude is inserted in eq .",
    "( [ fa ] ) a cancellation occurs between the contribution arising from the off - shell part of these amplitudes and three hadron contact terms originating from the chiral lagrangians .",
    "this cancellation is exact and analytical in the su(3 ) limit as shown in the case of @xmath8-wave interactions in refs .",
    "we have further checked that when the condition of the su(3 ) limit is removed , the sum of the contributions coming from the off - shell part of the two - body @xmath40 matrices and three hadron contact terms , which constitutes the sources of three - body forces , turns out to be very small as compared to the one obtained from the on - shell part .",
    "thus one can consider only the on - shell two - body t - matrices and ignore the three - body forces coming from the chiral lagrangians .",
    "this gives rise to the use of on - shell amplitudes in the solution of the faddeev equations , which in terms of these on - shell two - body @xmath40 matrices read as    @xmath48\\label{mko}.\\ ] ]    in eq .",
    "( [ mko ] ) @xmath49 is the three - body green function of the system and @xmath50 a loop function involving three - hadron propagators ( for more details , see refs .",
    "the faddeev partitions of eq .",
    "( [ fa ] ) are related to the @xmath51 partitions through : @xmath52 where @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) is the momentum of the particle @xmath37 in the initial ( final ) state .",
    "the two - body @xmath40 matrices and @xmath41 functions entering in eq .",
    "( [ mko ] ) depend on the invariant masses of the corresponding subsystems , @xmath55 , and the total energy of the system , @xmath8 . in this way",
    ", the @xmath51 amplitudes are calculated as a function of @xmath8 and the invariant mass of one of the pairs , for example the one related to particles 2 and 3 , @xmath56 , since the other kinematic variables can be obtained as a function of these two variables  @xcite .    after solving eq .",
    "( [ mko ] ) for a certain system , since we work in the charge basis , we project the resulting amplitudes in an isospin base in which the states are labelled by the total isospin of the three - body system , @xmath57 , and the isospin related to one of the subsystems , @xmath58 , and search for peaks in the squared amplitude which can be identified with resonances .",
    "one of the successes of unitary chiral dynamics is the reproduction of the @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) properties , which has been found to get dynamically generated ( with a two pole structure @xcite ) from the @xmath15 interaction and its coupled channels .",
    "if another pseudoscalar meson is added to this system , in @xmath61-wave , it results into states with spin - parity @xmath6 .",
    "the lightest pseudoscalar meson which can be added is the pion .",
    "the resulting three - body system would posses a mass @xmath62 1570 mev .",
    "this is exactly the region where the @xmath9 hyperon resonances are poorly understood  @xcite .",
    "the poor status of these low - lying @xmath63 states is evident from the following facts : a ) the spin - parity assignment for many of these states is unknown , e.g. , for @xmath64 , @xmath65 , etc .",
    ", b ) the partial - wave analysis and production experiments have been often archived separately in the pdg listings , e.g. , for @xmath66 , @xmath67 , c ) other times , e.g. , in case of @xmath68 , it is stated that existence of two resonances , in this energy region , is quite possible @xcite .",
    "this situation lead us to question if some of these poorly understood states could be understood as three - hadron resonances .",
    "in such a case , it would be difficult to investigate them considering only two hadron decay channels , which would result in poor information related to these resonances .",
    "in fact , some of them , like @xmath69 , @xmath70 , decay to three - body final states with large branching ratios  @xcite , implying that some of the wave functions of the @xmath9 resonances in the @xmath63 sector have an appreciable two - mesons and one baryon contribution , like @xmath24 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .    motivated by this , to search for possible three - body states , we started by taking all the combinations of a pseudoscalar meson of the @xmath74 su(3 ) octet and a baryon of the @xmath9 octet which couple to @xmath75 with any charge . to this system",
    "we add a pion and obtain twenty - two coupled channels with net charge zero : @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 .",

    "we see two peaks ; one at @xmath100 = 1656 mev with @xmath62 30 mev of width and another at @xmath100 = 1630 mev with 39 mev of width .",

    "this value is not exactly in the region where the @xmath125 gets dynamically generated , but it is also not very far away , and the attraction present in the system helps in forming a three - body bound state .",

    "the average @xmath149-@xmath149 distance and the distance between the @xmath146 cluster and @xmath150 are calculated and found to be 2.8 fm and 1.7 fm , respectively .",
    "the distance of the repulsive @xmath146 is also very similar to the corresponding result for the @xmath151 distance in the @xmath2 system .",
    "the kaonic state obtained within the two methods can probably be associated to the @xmath11 listed by the pdg @xcite ( which is omitted from the summary table ) and observed in @xmath132 partial wave analysis .",
    "however , the poor experimental information available in this energy region for kaonic states suggests that more experiments are needed to confirm the existence of this state .",
    "we get as a result a quasibound state of the @xmath3 system with 21 mev binding energy and 110 mev width .",
    "this state appears for an energy similar to the one of the resonance obtained in the faddeev calculation .",
    "it is interesting to notice that although the two methods are very different , the energy position of the quasibound @xmath3 state does not differ very much .",
    "note , however , that in the potential model used we consider only the single @xmath3 channel and do not take into account the possible modification of the two - body interaction in the presence of the third particle . in such simple calculation , for weakly bound systems ,",
    "the resulting binding energy and width correspond to the sum of the binding energies and widths of the two - body subsystems , @xmath21 and @xmath22 in the present case , as discussed in ref .",
    "in this talk i have presented an approach for solving the faddeev equations based on unitarized chiral theories , due to which a cancellation between the off shell part of the two body scattering matrices and three body contact terms stemming from the same theory is found . as a consequence on - shell two body",
