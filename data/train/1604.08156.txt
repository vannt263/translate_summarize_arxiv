    "the inflationary paradigm offers an elegant theoretical framework in which the emergence of the primordial curvature perturbations can be understood . in the simplest inflationary scenarios a primordial scalar perturbation with nearly scale - invariant power spectrum",
    "is generated by a single minimally - coupled scalar field @xmath4 rolling down a smooth potential @xmath5 . this framework seems to agree with the most recent cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data @xcite , which show a preference for plateau - like as @xmath6 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . ] over monomial potentials , as well as no compelling statistical evidence for a specific class of scenarios ( we refer the reader to @xcite for different points of view of the current observational status of inflation ) .",
    "recently , several works have analysed inflationary models that account for localised features in the primordial power spectrum , showing in some cases a better fit to the data with respect to a smooth power - law spectrum @xcite .",
    "features in the primordial power spectrum can be generated following departures from the slow - roll approximation , which can happen in more general inflationary scenarios with a symmetry - breaking phase transition .",
    "examples are the inflationary models with a step in the primordial potential , whose oscillation in the power spectrum of curvature perturbations is localised around the scale that crosses the horizon at the time the phase transition occurs  @xcite .    in principle",
    ", this oscillation could be seen in several observables , such as in the cmb maps and in the large - scale galaxy distribution , since the primordial scalar fluctuation is the seed for all the cosmic structures currently observed .",
    "it is therefore expected that data of the temperature anisotropy power spectrum as well as measurements of the matter power spectrum @xmath0 from galaxy surveys may provide hints on the origin of these features .",
    "originally , step - like inflationary potentials were postulated to study the  glitch \" appearing at the low-@xmath7 region of the cmb anisotropy spectrum .",
    "the signatures of this class of models in the cmb temperature power spectrum and bispectrum  @xcite and in the tensor spectrum @xcite have been studied in detail using the current data and have shown a consistent improvement of the @xmath8 values with respect to the featureless @xmath3cdm model .    in this work",
    "we proceed a step further in this kind of analysis and employ a bayesian statistical analysis to verify the predictions of a class of inflationary step - like potential models and discuss their observational viability in a wide range of scales , considering not only their observational consequences on the present cmb anisotropy temperature maps but also on the matter power spectrum @xmath0 .",
    "we work with two data sets : the second cmb data release of the planck collaboration  @xcite and a combination of these cmb data with measurements of the matter power spectrum from the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) cmass data release-@xmath9 sample of the sloan digital sky survey ( dr11-sdss ) experiment ( hereafter  cmb+sdss \" )   @xcite .",
