    "we predict that reduced lattice parameters will decrease the relative pump frequency sufficiently to allow homogeneous photonic density of states switching experiments .",
    "we have discussed four important requirements for free - carrier induced optical changes in semiconductors , with emphasis on density of states switching in photonic crystals : the amplitude of change in refractive index , the timescale on which the switch takes place , the induced absorption , and the homogeneity of the induced change .",
    "we have demonstrated that the first two requirements can be met : a @xmath4 change in @xmath7 in bulk silicon observed within 230  fs .",
    "we have also experimentally demonstrated sufficient lateral homogeneity in a bulk silicon .",
    "furthermore , we have measured two - photon absorption coefficients bulk silicon .",
    "the induced absorption was deduced to be low for carrier densities below @xmath31",
    "@xmath18 .",
    "we have discussed a non linear absorption model to describe the spatial homogeneity of optically generated electron - hole plasmas in semiconductors .",
    "we have introduced a homogeneity plot , which directly relates linear and two - photon absorption coefficients to the maximum homogeneity that can be achieved for any semiconductor .",
    "from such a plot , we conclude that for density of states switching in silicon photonic crystals , the optimum carrier density is about @xmath31  @xmath18 . to obtain the required homogeneity ,",
    "the absorption coefficients must be minimized , by a judicious choice of pump frequency . due to",
    "peak intensity limitations the lowest pump frequency that can be chosen is around 5000  @xmath3 .",
    "we have discussed the effect of scattering in photonic crystals on the pumping homogeneity .",
    "the homogeneity of switched photonic crystals turns out to be limited by scattering .",
    "we conclude that the homogeneity condition can barely be met in silicon inverse opals .",
    "we predict that in diamond structures the relative pump frequency will be small enough to allow homogeneous density of states switching experiments .",
    "finally , we have briefly discussed the ramifications for waveguides and modulators and we conclude that free - carrier switching is also useful for applications outside photonic crystal .",
