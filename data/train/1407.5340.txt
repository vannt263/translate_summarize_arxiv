    "john bell proved the impossibility of reproducing quantum theory ( qt ) with hidden variables in two different ways .",
    "the first , in a paper @xcite submitted in the summer of 1964 but not published until 1966 @xcite , shows the impossibility of explaining qt with non - contextual hidden variables .",
    "non - contextual hidden variable ( nchv ) theories are those in which every observable has a predefined outcome that is independent of the context ( i.e. , the set of co - measurable observables ) in which the observable is measured .",
    "the second way , in a paper submitted and published in 1964 @xcite , shows the impossibility of explaining qt with local hidden variables in a simplified version of the bipartite scenario considered by einstein , podolsky and rosen .",
    "local hidden variable ( lhv ) theories are those in which outcomes are independent of spacelike separated measurements . nowadays , by `` quantum contextuality '' and `` quantum non - locality '' we refer to the impossibility of explaining qt with nchv and lhv theories , respectively . two key observations that connect both bell s papers are that quantum probabilities can not be reproduced by a joint probability distribution over a single probability space and that quantum non - locality follows from quantum contextuality when the contexts are made of observables measured on spacelike separated regions .",
    "this means that bell - inequality scenarios ( where a pre - established number of parties , measurements for each party and outcomes for each measurement is assumed ) involve extra constraints with respect to more abstract scenarios ( where no such assumptions are made ) .",
    "this paper discusses how to deal with these extra constraints .",
    "the approach presented here refines the graph - theoretical approach introduced by cabello , severini and winter ( csw ) to study quantum correlations without these extra constraints @xcite ( a different refinement has been presented in ref .",

    "@xcite , i.e. , quantum projective measurements . here",
    "we introduce a novel graph - based method for characterizing the set of quantum correlations for experimental scenarios such as specific non - contextuality - inequality @xcite and bell - inequality scenarios .",
    "the name non - contextuality ( nc ) inequality was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the csw graph - theoretical approach to quantum correlations aims at singling out quantum correlations among correlations in general probabilistic theories ( here understood as those that specify the joint probabilities of each possible set of outcomes of each possible set of co - measurable observables given each possible state ) and is based on the following ideas and results :    \\(i ) an _ experimental scenario _ is defined by a set of observables ( each with a certain number of outcomes ) and their relationships of co - measurability .",
    "a _ context _ is a set of observables that are co - measurable .",
    "typical experimental scenarios involve observables belonging to two or more contexts . by _ event _ , csw mean",
    "a proposition such as `` outcomes @xmath6 are respectively obtained when observables @xmath7 are jointly measured '' , which is denoted as @xmath8 .",
    "two events are _ exclusive _ if both include one measurement @xmath9 with distinct outcomes @xmath10 . for more precise definitions of events and exclusive events ,",
    "see ref .  @xcite . to any experimental scenario , csw associate a graph @xmath11 in which events are represented by vertices and pairs of exclusive events are represented by adjacent vertices .",
    "@xmath11 is called the _ exclusivity graph of the experimental scenario_.    \\(ii ) a nc inequality is a constraint on a linear combination of probabilities of a subset of events of the corresponding scenario .",
    "normalization of probability distributions can be used to express this linear combination as a _ positive _ linear combination of probabilities of events , @xmath12 , with @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , any nc inequality can be expressed as @xmath14 where @xmath0 is the maximum value attainable with nchv theories ( or with lhv theories in the case of a bell inequality ) .",
    "the fact that any nc inequality can be written in different forms which are related to each other by adding multiples of normalization and/or co - measurability conditions implies that each of these forms may lead to a different @xmath1 .",
    "recall that co - measurability implies that marginal probabilities are independent of other co - measurable observables and , in this sense , co - measurability generalizes the notion of no - signalling invoked in bell - inequality scenarios .",
    "\\(iii ) csw associate to @xmath1 a vertex - weighted graph @xmath15 with vertex set @xmath16 , where @xmath17 ( in fact , @xmath18 is an induced subgraph of @xmath11 ) and @xmath19 represents event @xmath20 such that @xmath21 is in @xmath1 , adjacent vertices represent exclusive events and the corresponding vertex weights are the coefficient @xmath22 .",
    "csw refer to @xmath15 as the _ exclusivity graph of @xmath1_.    \\(iv ) csw prove that the maximum of @xmath1 in qt is upper bounded by the _ lovsz number _ of @xmath15 , denoted as @xmath23 .",
    "the lovsz number was introduced by lovsz , for non - weighted graphs , as an upper bound to the shannon capacity of a graph @xcite and then extended to vertex - weighted graphs in ref .",
    "the lovsz number of @xmath15 can be defined @xcite as @xmath24 where the maximum is taken over all orthonormal representations of @xmath25 and handles in any ( finite or infinite ) dimension .",

    "@xmath25 of a graph @xmath18 with vertex set @xmath16 is the graph with the same vertex set such that two vertices @xmath26 are adjacent in @xmath25 if and only if @xmath26 are not adjacent in @xmath18 . an _ orthonormal representation _ in @xmath27 of @xmath25 assigns a unit vector @xmath28 to each @xmath19 such that @xmath29 , for all pairs @xmath26 of non - adjacent vertices in @xmath25 ( i.e. , adjacent in @xmath30 ) .",
    "a further unit vector @xmath31 , called _ handle _ , is usually specified together with the orthonormal representation .",
    "the set of all vectors of probabilities of the form @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is an orthonormal representation of @xmath25 and @xmath34 is a handle , is the _ grtschel - lovsz - schrijver ( gls ) theta body _ of @xmath18 @xcite , denoted as @xmath35 , and represents the _ set of quantum correlations associated to @xmath18 _ , defined as the set of vectors of probabilities of events attainable through quantum projective measurements ( without any further constraint ) satisfying the relationships of exclusivity encoded in @xmath18 .",
    "we will denote this set as @xmath36 .",
    "\\(v ) csw also show that , for any graph @xmath15 , there is always an nc inequality ( but not necessarily a bell inequality ) such that its maximum in qt is exactly @xmath23 and a quantum system and an experimental scenario spanning exactly @xmath35 .",
    "this result identifies @xmath23 as a fundamental physical limit for quantum correlations associated to @xmath18 and @xmath35 as the set of quantum correlations for a given @xmath18 .",
    "a problem of the csw approach is that , for a given nc or bell inequality ( expressed as a specific @xmath1 ) , @xmath23 _ may only give an upper bound _ to the maximum quantum value of @xmath1 . as noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite , this occurs because @xmath15 does not contain information about some additional constraints that may exist in @xmath1 .",
    "for example , if @xmath1 refers to a bipartite bell - inequality scenario , two events @xmath37 ( denoting `` alice measures @xmath9 and obtains @xmath38 , and bob measures @xmath39 and obtains @xmath40 '' ) and @xmath41 can be exclusive because alice s parts of the events are exclusive ( i.e. , because @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) , because bob s parts of the events are exclusive ( i.e. , because @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) or because both alice s and bob s parts of the events are exclusive .",
    "@xmath1 tells us in which of these three cases we are .",
    "however , this information is lost when we represent @xmath1 by @xmath15 .",
    "this problem does not only affect bell inequalities , but also many nc inequalities ( e.g. , nc inequalities resulting from those discussed in section  [ section4 ] by identifying each party with a different degree of freedom of a single physical system ) .    in this paper",
    "we solve this problem by encoding these extra constraints in a multigraph @xmath46 composed of @xmath47 simple graphs sharing the same vertex set , and introduce a novel multigraph number , denoted as @xmath48 , that gives the quantum maximum for any @xmath1 .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following : in section  [ section2a ] we define @xmath46 , which refines @xmath15 .",
    "in section  [ section2b ] we define @xmath48 , which refines @xmath23 , and @xmath49 , which refines @xmath36 .",
    "unlike @xmath23 , which can be computed to any desired precision in polynomial time @xcite using a single semi - definite program ( sdp ) , we can only compute upper bounds to @xmath48 by means of a hierarchy of sdps which progressively implement extra restrictions . in section  [ section3 ]",
    "we show how to compute upper bounds to @xmath48 using the ideas developed by navascus , pironio and acn ( npa ) @xcite . in section  [ section4 ]",
    "we compute upper bounds to @xmath48 for some bell inequalities that are important for different reasons .",
    "all of them have in common the fact that @xmath23 does not provide their quantum maxima but @xmath48 does .",

    "so far , none of the proposed principles has explained the entire set of quantum correlations for any bell inequality .",
    "however , for some exclusivity graphs , the exclusivity principle @xcite has succeeded in preventing sets of correlations larger than the set allowed by qt @xcite .",
    "the multigraph approach connects ( i ) and ( ii ) and opens a new perspective ( as , alternatively , does the hypergraph approach in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the fact that any conceivable csw graph @xmath15 corresponds to a physically realizable situation shows that there is a physically realizable layer of quantum correlations that can be put in correspondence with csw graphs .",
    "the characterization of the possible correlations in this first layer is mathematically simple : the maximum is given by the lovsz number of @xmath15 and can be calculated by a single sdp , and the set of quantum correlations , @xmath36 , is equal to the gls theta body of the exclusivity graph @xcite .",
    "of course , @xmath36 is , in general , larger than the set of quantum correlations for a _ specific _ nc or bell inequality whose exclusivity graph is @xmath15 .    in this work",

    "the fact that any conceivable multigraph of the type considered in this paper also corresponds to a physically realizable situation shows that there is a deeper layer in which extra constraints limit the values of the quantum correlations with respect to the ones corresponding to csw graphs .",

    "[ fig0 ] , @xmath49 , are distinct , although both give the same maximum for the chsh inequality .",

    ", the multigraphs introduced in this paper can be put in correspondence with this deeper layer , the multipartite quantum correlations in the set @xmath49 .",

    "the labelling of vertices of @xmath95 imposes additional restrictions on the possible probability assignments .",
    "the use of multigraphs also opens the door for solving some interesting problems .",
    "for example : which is the simplest bipartite bell inequality exhibiting full quantum non - locality ? that is , the bell inequality in which the maximum quantum value equals the maximum no - signalling value @xcite as occurs with the bell inequality in ref .",

    "this kind of arguments allows us to refine previous methods for searching for interesting physical scenarios by finding graphs with certain properties @xcite .",
    "moreover , the fact that the multigraph lovsz number of any multigraph of the type considered in this paper represents quantum correlations between the outcomes of projective measurements of some nc or bell inequality and that , reciprocally , any of these quantum correlations can be represented as a multigraph , indicates that multigraphs can be used to investigate and classify these quantum correlations .",

    "define a sequence of @xmath231 as a product of elements in @xmath231 ; the length @xmath143 of a sequence is defined as the minimum number of elements of @xmath231 needed to generate it .",

    "let @xmath234 denote the set of non - null sequences of length not larger than @xmath143 , assuming the identity operator @xmath235 to be a sequence of length @xmath236 .",

    "if the behaviour @xmath247 is quantum , then real numbers can be assigned to the variables @xmath9 such that the matrix @xmath238 is positive semi - definite .",
    "this holds because if @xmath247 is quantum all entries of @xmath238 can be defined to be of the form @xmath248 .",

    "the set of behaviours that lead to a positive semi - definite @xmath238 is denoted @xmath253 , and , as proven above , contains the set of quantum behaviours @xmath254 . since the sets of sequences @xmath234 are ordered as a hierarchy where @xmath255 , the sets @xmath253 are also hierarchically structured as @xmath256 .",
    "according to npa , the set @xmath253 converges to the set of quantum behaviours @xmath254 in the limit of @xmath143 going to infinity , @xmath257 .",
    "it is important to remark that intermediate sets of behaviours can be defined between two sets @xmath253 and @xmath258 .",
    "this can be done by defining a set of sequences @xmath1 which strictly contains the set @xmath234 but is strictly contained in the set @xmath259 , and defining a matrix @xmath260 as above .",
    "an important example was introduced by npa as the set denoted @xmath199 .",
    "the corresponding set for the multigraph @xmath95 is given by @xmath261 in some of the cases we study in this paper , even the set @xmath128 is too resource demanding to deal with .",

    ", the problem variable is the matrix @xmath238 , and the parameters can be read from the multigraph alone .",
    "first , notice that the multigraph lovsz number can be written , in the limit @xmath273 , as @xmath274 , where @xmath269 is a matrix that selects in @xmath238 the entries associated to the probabilities @xmath275 , with @xmath19 , and assign the correct weights @xmath276 to each one of them .",

    "then , the probabilities @xmath285 are always assigned to the same entries of @xmath238 .",
    "they are @xmath286 regardless of the degree @xmath143 .    in the npa method",
    "it is assumed that the sets of measurement operators of each party are partitioned in subsets in which the elements of each are assumed to be associated with the different outcomes of the same measurement .",
    "because of this assumption , the operators in each of these subsets are said to be _ complete _ , in the sense that they form a resolution of the identity .",
    "on the one hand , this assumption allows the definition of marginal probabilities that also respect the no - signalling conditions present in a bell scenario . on the other hand",
    ", it introduces redundancies in the sets of measurement operators and constraints in the joint probability distributions .",
    "to get rid of these constraints , npa redefine the sets of measurement operators and the set of quantum behaviours . this way , all the probabilities present in the matrix @xmath238 are independent and no relations of the type @xmath287 are necessary .",
    "in our method , though , this notion of completeness is not directly defined and this has a consequence in the definition of the marginal probabilities .",
    "marginal probabilities appear as entries in the matrix @xmath288 and , in our case , they are not fully independent of the joint probabilities associated to the vertices of the multigraph .",
    "it is important to note that in our definition of multipartite quantum behaviour we assume the measurement operators to be projectors , and it follows as a property that the local projectors of , e.g. , party @xmath289 associated to vertices that compose a clique @xmath290 of the exclusivity factor @xmath222 project onto complementary subspaces of the hilbert space , and thus must sum to , at most , the identity operator , @xmath291 for all cliques @xmath290 in @xmath222 .",
    "this property implies that the marginal probabilities associated to all vertices of an exclusivity factor of @xmath292 must satisfy @xmath293 where @xmath294 is the marginal probability associated to vertex @xmath295 of party @xmath292 .",
    "analogous relations follow for cliques @xmath296 in @xmath223 .",
    "these restrictions must be inserted as constraints of the sdp .",
    "it is easy to note that they are of the form @xmath297 , since both the joint probabilities @xmath285 and the marginal probabilities @xmath294 are present as entries of @xmath238 .",
    "notice that one could replace restriction ( [ subnormalization ] ) by the stronger condition of saturating this inequality . imposing the later is equivalent to assuming that the size of the clique coincides with the number of possible outcomes for such observable , while imposing the former is equivalent to assuming that this is only a lower bound .",
    "imposing subnormalization ( i.e. , ( [ subnormalization ] ) ) is more appropriate , since in actual experiments some of the prepared particles are not detected .",
    "naturally , correlation sets obtained imposing subnormalization are , in general , larger than those obtained assuming normalization .",
    "however , this simply follows from defining differently what is meant by a measurement to have a number of outcomes .",
    "we have performed simulations using both the strong normalization constraint and the subnormalization constraint , and we obtained the same upper bounds for the multigraph lovsz number for all the multigraphs studied in this paper .",
    "an interesting open problem is whether there are cases where a lovsz optimum projective representation does not saturate some of the conditions ( [ subnormalization ] ) .",
    "additionally , it is worth noting that , in the case of exclusivity multigraphs that represent specific nc or bell inequalities , our method does not take into account the labels @xmath8 of the events associated to the vertices of the multigraph .",
    "if labels were considered , then it would be possible to identify , in the factor of a particular party , different vertices that represent the same party s part of the event , and the program would converge faster , since a reduced number of measurement operators would be considered . this would be essentially equivalent to using the npa method as described in refs .",
    "the novel point in our approach is that , even though we do not add this constraint , we observe that the optimal results obtained are consistent with it , in the sense that if two vertices @xmath298 and @xmath295 are supposed to represent the same local event @xmath299 of party @xmath289 , then , in the optimal results obtained , @xmath300 and @xmath301 , for all @xmath302 . and",
    "@xmath295 be two vertices of a factor @xmath303 of a multigraph @xmath46 , and let @xmath304 and @xmath305 be the sets of neighbours of @xmath298 and @xmath295 ( i.e. , the sets of vertices in @xmath303 which are connected by an edge to @xmath298 and @xmath295 , respectively ) . for @xmath298 and @xmath295 to be associated to the same projector @xmath306 , it is necessary that @xmath307 , so let us assume that this is the case .",

    "then , the ranges of both @xmath310 and @xmath311 are contained in the subspace complementary to @xmath308 ; denote it as @xmath312 . since this is the only restriction on the projectors @xmath310 and @xmath311",
    ", we can see that the multigraph lovsz number is obtained when @xmath313 and the range of this projector is equal to @xmath312 .",
    "] this implies that our method can not perform better than npa s when the bell scenario is given , and the bounds obtained are necessarily greater than or equal to the bounds of npa for the same level in the hierarchies .",
    "the program we used to implement our version of the npa method was written in matlab and made use of the packages yalmip @xcite , sedumi @xcite and sdpt3 @xcite .",
    "the inputs are the multigraph @xmath101 , given in terms of the adjacency matrices of its exclusivity factors , and the degree @xmath143 of the hierarchy to be considered .",
    "it is interesting to note that the only challenge is to create the matrix @xmath238 and to identify the entries that correspond to the same variables and whether they are probabilities or not .",
    "the first routine creates a @xmath314-dimensional structure @xmath315 in which each entry stores the label of one of the symbolic elements of @xmath277 .",
    "as mentioned above , we assume the elements of @xmath277 to be labelled from @xmath278 to @xmath279 , where @xmath316 is assigned to @xmath235 , @xmath317 is assigned to @xmath318 , for @xmath282 , and @xmath319 is assigned to @xmath320 , for @xmath284 .",

    "the information in the multigraph is relevant : if a sequence , e.g. , @xmath232 , is such that there is an edge between vertices @xmath38 and @xmath233 in @xmath222 , then the operators are associated to locally exclusive events and their product is the null operator , resulting in a null sequence . only non - null sequences are considered .",
    "we consider levels which are between @xmath176 and @xmath128 , levels which we denote as @xmath262 . specifically , to construct the structure @xmath324 ,",
    "we randomly pick @xmath9 elements among the @xmath325 associated to the projectors of party @xmath289 and @xmath9 elements among the @xmath325 associated to the projectors of party @xmath292 .",
    "we repeat this process several times and the described results are the best obtained in the sample .",
    "after the structure @xmath321 is built , a routine checks whether there are redundant entries and , if this is the case , removes them .",
    "then , matrix @xmath238 is built based on the information of labels present in @xmath321 .",
    "it is a @xmath326 symmetric structure in which entry @xmath327 stores the composition of the labels stored in entries @xmath328 and @xmath329 ; the @xmath330 is to remind that the labels should be composed in reverse order , since , in the definition of @xmath238 , the entry @xmath327 should be associated to the product @xmath241 .",
    "again , in the composition , it should be checked whether there is a product of locally exclusive events in the result ; if this is the case , then the value @xmath236 is assigned to the corresponding entry .    in the next step ,",
    "after the construction of @xmath238 , a routine identifies which entries are supposed to represent probabilities and which represent undetermined variables .",
    "a non - negativity constraint is imposed to the probabilities if the level considered is lower than @xmath128 . as remarked by npa , in such cases",
    "it is not guaranteed that the behaviours will be non - negative .",
