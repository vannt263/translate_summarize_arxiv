    "the pair @xmath3 and the projective class @xmath5 $ ] determines a teichmller geodesic ray which starts at @xmath3 and where the associated vertical foliation is a multiple of @xmath0 @xcite , @xcite . let @xmath6 , @xmath7 , denote the point on this ray whose teichmller distance from @xmath3 is @xmath8 .",
    "the pair @xmath3 and @xmath0 determines another ray in @xmath4 defined by grafting @xmath3 along @xmath9 , for @xmath10 .",
    "we denote the resulting riemann surface by @xmath11 .",
    "( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for background on grafting . )    in this paper we show that each grafting ray stays in a bounded neighborhood of a teichmller geodesic :    [ thm : main ] let @xmath12 be @xmath13thick and let @xmath0 be a measured geodesic lamination on @xmath3 with unit hyperbolic length .",
    "then for all @xmath7 we have @xmath14 where the constant @xmath15 depends only on @xmath16 and the topology of @xmath2 ( it is independent of @xmath0 and @xmath3 ) .    here",

    "@xmath13thick _ if the injectivity radius of the hyperbolic metric on @xmath3 is at least @xmath13 at every point .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] actually produces a bound on the distance that depends continuously on the point in moduli space determined by @xmath3 ; the existence of a constant depending only on the injectivity radius is then a consequence of the compactness of the @xmath13thick part of moduli space .",
    "however , the dependence on the injectivity radius of @xmath3 is unavoidable :    [ introthm : example ] there exists a sequence of points @xmath19 in @xmath4 and measured laminations @xmath20 with unit hyperbolic length on @xmath19 such that for any sequence @xmath21 in @xmath4 , @xmath22    we now outline the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] .",
    "the main construction ( carried out in   [ sec : dual][sec : themap ] , culminating in proposition  [ prop : themap ] ) produces an explicit family of quasiconformal maps between the riemann surfaces along a grafting ray and those of a teichmller geodesic ray starting from another point @xmath23 .",
    "this is done in the case that @xmath2 has no punctures .",
    "unfortunately , the quasiconformal constant for these maps and the distance @xmath24 depend on the pair @xmath25 , whereas for the main theorem we seek a uniform upper bound .",
    "such a bound is derived from the construction in several steps .",
    "first , we show that there exist points @xmath26 for which the quasiconformal constants are uniform over an open set in @xmath27 (  [ sec : themap ] ) .",
    "then , using the action of the mapping class group and the co - compactness of the @xmath13thick part of @xmath28 , we show that for any @xmath13thick surface @xmath3 and any @xmath29 there exists @xmath30 near @xmath3 for which the uniform estimates apply to @xmath31 .    at this point",
    "we have proved the main theorem up to moving the base points of both the grafting ray and the teichmller geodesic ray by a bounded distance from the given @xmath12 .",
    "the proof is concluded by showing that both the grafting and teichmller rays starting from these perturbed basepoints fellow travel those starting from the original point @xmath3 .    for the teichmller ray case , we use a recent theorem of rafi @xcite ( generalizing earlier results of @xcite and @xcite ) which states that teichmller geodesics with the same vertical foliation fellow travel , with a bound on the distance depending only on the thickness @xmath13 and the distance between the starting points .    it remains to show that grafting rays in a given direction @xmath0 fellow travel . in ",
    "[ sec : lipschitz ] we show that @xmath0grafting defines a self - map of teichmller space that is uniformly lipschitz with respect to the teichmller metric , and since the lipschitz constant is independent of @xmath0 , the fellow traveling property of grafting rays follows .",
    "the key to this lipschitz bound is a certain extension of grafting to quasi - fuchsian groups .    in",
    "order describe this extension , we regard grafting as a map @xmath32where @xmath27 is the space of measured laminations on @xmath2 and @xmath33 is the realization of teichmller space as the set of marked fuchsian groups , which is a real - analytic manifold parameterizing hyperbolic structures on @xmath2 . by a construction of thurston , this map lifts to a projective grafting map @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the space of marked complex projective structures .    interpreting teichmller space as the `` diagonal '' in quasi - fuchsian space @xmath36",
    ", we show that projective grafting extends to a holomorphic map defined on a uniform metric neighborhood of @xmath37 in @xmath38 . here",
    "we give @xmath38 the kobayashi metric , which is the sup - product of the teichmller metrics on @xmath28 and @xmath39 , and we show :    [ thm : extension ] there exists @xmath40 such that projective grafting extends to a map @xmath41 that is holomorphic with respect to the second parameter , where @xmath42 is the open @xmath43neighborhood of @xmath37 with respect to the kobayashi metric on @xmath38 .    composing this map @xmath44 with the forgetful map @xmath45 , we also obtain a map @xmath46 , holomorphic in the first factor , which is the extension that we use in the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] .",
    "note that the original grafting map @xmath47 is _ not _ holomorphic with respect to the usual complex structure on @xmath28 ; the holomorphic behavior described in theorem  [ thm : extension ] can only be seen by considering teichmller space as a totally real submanifold of @xmath38 .",
    "we remark that the existence of a local holomorphic extension of @xmath48 ( or @xmath49 ) to a neighborhood of a point in @xmath37 follows easily from results of kourouniotis or scannell  wolf ( see  [ subsec : extension ] for details ) , but that extension to a uniform neighborhood of @xmath37 ( i.e.  the existence of @xmath50 ) is essential for application to theorem  [ thm : main ] and does not follow immediately from such local considerations .    using the holomorphic extension of grafting and the contraction of kobayashi distance by holomorphic maps",
    ", we then establish the lipschitz property for grafting :    [ thm : lipschitz ] there exists a constant @xmath1 such that for any measured lamination @xmath29 , the grafting map @xmath51 is @xmath1lipschitz .",
    "that is , given any two points @xmath3 and @xmath52 in @xmath4 , we have @xmath53    in  [ sec : conclusion ] we combine the rectangle construction with the fellow traveling properties for grafting and teichmller rays to derive the main theorem for compact surfaces . in  [ sec : punctures ] we show how the preceding argument can be modified to prove theorem  [ thm : main ] in the case @xmath2 has punctures .",
    "finally , in  [ sec : example ] we construct an example illustrating theorem  [ introthm : example ] .",
    "given any point @xmath54 and a projective class @xmath5 $ ] of a measured geodesic lamination on @xmath3 , there are different ways to geometrically define a ray which starts at @xmath3 and `` heads in the direction of @xmath5 $ ] '' ; examples include the teichmller ray , the grafting ray , and the line of minima @xcite .",
    "given any path in teichmller space , by taking the shortest curve on each surface , we get a path in the complex @xmath55 of curves of @xmath2 , which is often called the _ shadow _ of the original path .",
    "masur and minsky showed @xcite that the shadow of a teichmller geodesic is an unparameterized quasi - geodesic in @xmath56 .",
    "a consequence of theorem  [ thm : main ] is that the shadow of a grafting ray remains a bounded distance in @xmath55 from the shadow of a teichmller geodesic ray .",
    "hence , it follows that the same is true of the grafting ray . in the case of a line of minima , though it may not remain a bounded distance from any teichmller geodesic , it was shown @xcite that its shadow fellow - travels that of its associated teichmller geodesic .",
    "it is interesting that although these paths are defined in rather different ways , at the level of the curve complex , they are essentially the same .      using a combinatorial model for the teichmller metric , daz and kim showed that the conclusion of theorem  [ thm : main ] holds for grafting rays of laminations supported on simple closed geodesics @xcite .",
    "however , the resulting bound on distance depends on the geometry of the geodesics in an essential way , obstructing the extension of their method to more general laminations by a limiting argument .",
    "grafting rays were also studied by wolf and the second author in @xcite , where it was shown that for any @xmath12 , the map @xmath57 gives a homeomorphism between @xmath27 and @xmath28 . in particular , teichmller space is the union of the grafting rays based at @xmath3 , which are pairwise disjoint . in light of theorem  [ thm : main ] , we find that this `` polar coordinate system '' defined using grafting is a bounded distance from the teichmller exponential map at @xmath3 .",

    "we emphasize that the constructions above are not continuous in any _ neighborhood _ of @xmath97 in the measure topology of @xmath27 ; rather , maximality of @xmath97 implies continuity at @xmath97 , since for maximal laminations , convergence in measure and in the hausdorff sense are the same .    let us further assume that @xmath104 and @xmath81 satisfy :    1 .",

    "2 .   the horizontal sides of rectangles in @xmath105 containing the endpoints of @xmath81 do not meet the singularities of @xmath104 .",
    "then we can conclude that for @xmath0 sufficiently close to @xmath97 and an arc @xmath106 sufficiently close to @xmath81 , the rectangle decomposition @xmath107 is well - defined and is topologically equivalent ( i.e.  isotopic ) to @xmath108 .",
    "first , note that @xmath109 is still disjoint from @xmath0 and transverse to @xmath58 .",
    "moreover , the condition ( h1 ) ensures that every point in @xmath110 and @xmath111 corresponds to a unique point in @xmath109 .",

    "to quantify the geometry of a rectangle decomposition , rather than its topology , we introduce parameters describing aspects of the shape of a rectangle @xmath122 .",

    "since we are assuming @xmath126 has no saddle connections , each horizontal edge of @xmath94 either contains exactly one singularity of @xmath69 or does not contain any singularities , but ends at an endpoint of @xmath81 . in the former case ,",
    "the singularity divides the edge into two _ horizontal half - edges_. although in the latter case , the edge is not divided , we nonetheless refer to it as a horizontal  half - edge \" and include it in the set @xmath127 of horizontal half - edges of @xmath94 . define @xmath128 where @xmath129 denotes the hyperbolic length of @xmath130 .",
