    "spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) of a quantum particle plays a key role in many physical phenomena , including fine structures of atomic spectra , spin hall effect @xcite , topological insulators @xcite and topological superconductors @xcite . in general , the soc strengths in solid materials are fixed , and the observation of soc effects is hindered by unavoidable impurities and disorder . in contrast , the spin - orbit coupled ultracold atomic gases demonstrated by the milestone experiments lin , pwang , cheuk , jyzhang offer an extremely clean platform with full controllability to explore novel macroscopic quantum phenomena and quantum topological states @xcite , especially for bosons ho , sinha , hu , li , kawakami , yzhang , ruokokoski , zhu . recently ,",
    "the two - dimensional ( 2d ) socs for boson gases and for fermion gases have been realized , respectively @xcite , which is crucial in studying the exotic properties of high - dimensional topological matter .",
    "of particular interest are the topological excitations in rotating bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) with soc .",

    "in fact , various trapping potentials may significantly affect the ground states and dynamic properties of the becs @xcite , which leads to a rich physics . in this work",
    ", we investigate the vortex states and spin textures of rotating becs with rashba soc in a toroidal trap . as a non - trivial geometry",
    ", toroidal trap can be easily created in current experiments @xcite , and it provides us a unique platform to investigate the exotic properties of quantum superfluids . therefore our work is experimentally feasible and allows to be tested in future experiments . we show that increasing 2d isotropic soc can enhance the formation of visible vortex ring , hidden giant vortex ( or hidden singly quantized vortices ) , and spin domain walls for large rotation frequency above the critical value . in the nonrotating limit , strong 2d isotropic soc generates a heliciform - stripe phase for the initially separated condensates in a toroidal trap .",
    "in addition , large strength of the 1d soc leads to the creation of hidden linear vortex string and the transition from initial phase separation ( or phase mixing ) to phase mixing ( or phase separation ) .",

    "the horizontal and vertical coordinates @xmath27 and @xmath28 are in units of @xmath81.,width=377 ]    as shown in figure 1(a ) , the two components of the nonrotating bec display typical phase mixing ( top two rows ) and phase separation ( bottom two rows ) , due to the interatomic interactions satisfying @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively . for the convenience of discussion , in the following texts we call the two phases briefly initial phase mixing and initial phase separation , respectively . in the case of initial phase mixing , when @xmath73 the rotation driving inputs sufficient angular momentum such that three visible vortices wen1,wen3 occur in each component and constitute a triangular vortex lattice ( abrikosov lattice ) , where the two visible vortex lattices are staggered each other [ see the top two rows in ( b)-(c ) ] .",
    "when @xmath75 a giant vortex ( a multiply - quantized vortex ) is generated in each component [ see the top two rows of ( d)-(e ) ] , which is inaccessible in a harmonically trapped bec because for @xmath84 the resulting centrifugal effect would cancel the radial confinement and the thomas - fermi ( tf ) radius of the bec would diverge . in the case of initial phase separation , when @xmath85 the component densities become separated petals , where the hidden vortices @xcite form a regular vortex cluster . with the further increase of rotation frequency , e.g. , @xmath75",
    ", the component densities form two butt - joint semi - rings and the hidden vortices display complex topological structures , which can be seen in the bottom two rows of ( d)-(e ) .",
    "secondly , we consider the effect of soc on the ground state of the nonrotating spin-1/2 bec in a toroidal potential .",
    "the main results are illustrated in figure 2 .",
    "for 2d weak soc , e.g. , @xmath86 , the ground - state structure of the system with an initial phase mixing is similar to that with an initial phase separation except for the difference between the density mixing and the density separation , where few ghost vortices are generated in each component [ see the left four columns in ( a)-(b ) ] .",
    "however , for 2d strong soc , e.g. , @xmath87 , there exists a remarkable difference between the ground - state structure in the case of initial phase mixing and that in the case of initial phase separation [ see the left four columns in ( c)-(d ) ] . for the former case ,",
    "a visible vortex string is formed along the @xmath88 axis in each component , and the two vortex strings are separated spatially due to the strong soc .",
    "in contrast , for the latter case , the two components display spatially separated and heliciform stripe structures .",
    "when there is only 1d soc in the bec , e.g. , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , the system exhibits either a  fully mixed phase with a fringe - shape phase distribution for weak interspecies repulsion or a separated stripe phase along the @xmath27 direction for strong interspecies repulsion , which are referred as thomas - fermi ( tf ) phase ( plane wave phase ) and stripe phase @xcite , respectively . as for the other values of @xmath25 and @xmath90 , our simulation shows that the density and phase patterns are similar to those in the right two columns of figure 2 .",

    "this feature exists not only for the case of @xmath126 but also for the case of @xmath127 [ see figures 3(b ) , 3(d ) and ( 3e ) ] . here",
    "the visible vortices form ringlike structures .",
    "the region of the large density hole is occupied by a central hidden giant vortex and a ( several ) hidden vortex ring(s ) [ see figures 3(b ) and 3(e ) ] .",
    "the ringlike visible vortex configuration has also been found in a two - component spin - orbit coupled bec subject to an in - plane gradient magnetic field @xcite .",
    "however , the present toroidal system can exhibit more rich and complex topological structures due to the interplay among rotation , interatomic interactions , soc , and toroidal confinement .",
    "in addition , a topology transition is indicated in the system .",
    "we take the case of @xmath128 as an example . in figure 3(c ) , there exist two vortices around the center of component @xmath8 . for comparison , there are five visible vortices around the center visible vortex of component @xmath8 in figure 3(d ) and eight nearest hidden vortices around the center giant vortex of component @xmath8 in figure 3(e ) , respectively .",
    "therefore these patterns display the transition of the topological structure as the strength of soc increases , which indicates that soc can be used to control the topological structure of the rotating toroidal bec .",
    "note that there are obvious singular points in the total density @xmath112 of the system ( see the fifth column ) .",
    "thus the topological defects in the present system are different from the common coreless vortices @xcite or the so - called anderson - toulouse vortices @xcite .",
    "the corresponding spin - density distributions are shown in figure 4 . in the pseudo - spin representation ,",
    "the blue region denotes spin - down and the red region denotes spin - up . to understand the interesting spin structures , we take the case of @xmath104 , @xmath70 , and @xmath129 as a typical example . from @xmath130 in figure 4(a )",
    ", the spin continuously turn from down to up along the radial direction and then gradually turn back to down . at the same time , @xmath131 obeys an odd parity distribution along the @xmath27 direction and an even parity distribution along the @xmath28 direction , but the situation is the reverse for @xmath132 .",
    "becs with soc in a toroidal trap , where @xmath104 , and columns ( a)-(e ) correspond to rows ( a)-(e ) in figure 3 , respectively .",
    "the rows ( from top to bottom ) denote @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath130 components of the spin density vector , respectively . the horizontal and vertical coordinates",
    "@xmath27 and @xmath28 are in units of @xmath81.,width=453 ]    displayed in figure 5(a ) and figures 5(b)-5(c ) are the topological charge density and the spin texture for the parameters in figure 4(a ) , respectively .",
    "obviously , there are five radial - out skyrmions liu , skyrme , zhai2,kasamatsu3 in figure 5(b ) which constitute a skyrmion lattice in spin representation .",
    "the larger soc leads to the generation of a more complex skyrmion lattice ( including more skyrmions even giant skyrmion @xcite ) through the strong interaction between the ` spin ' angular momentum and orbit angular momentum of the atoms , where the necklace - like distribution in the spin density becomes more distinct .",
    "this characteristic is present evidently for both the cases of @xmath126 and @xmath127 [ see figures 4(b ) , 4(d ) and 4(e ) ] . in particular",
    ", we find that at certain parameters the rotating toroidal system with soc supports a skyrmion pair .",
    "figures 5(e)-5(f ) show the spin texture and its local amplification at @xmath104 , @xmath71 , and @xmath133 , and figure 5(d ) gives the corresponding topological charge density .",
    "we see that the spin texture exhibits a radial(out)-radial(out ) skyrmion configuration , which is quite different from the normal seven basic skyrmion configurations @xcite of rotating spin - orbit - coupled becs in a harmonic trap .",

    "when the soc strength is relatively weak and the rotation frequency is small , there is a typical triangular vortex lattice in component @xmath8 and a doubly quantized vortex in component @xmath1 . with the increase of rotation frequency ,",
    "the trap center region is pinned by a triply quantized vortex for component @xmath8 and a doubly quantized vortex for component @xmath1 .",
    "at the same time , a vortex ring is formed on the periphery of the giant vortex in each component .",
    "for large soc strength , each component forms a complex topological structure composed of laminar visible vortex ring(s ) and a large density hole .",
    "note that the large density hole represents a giant vortex plus hidden vortex ring(s ) rather than a pure giant vortex which is observed in conventional rotating becs @xcite .",
    "in addition , the density distributions and phase distributions for the two components become similar .",

    "the topological structure of the system in figure 7(a ) is a typical anderson - toulouse coreless vortex @xcite , where the core of the circulating external component is filled with the other nonrotating component . with the further increase of rotation frequency ,",
    "each component of the system evolves from a standard triangular vortex lattice into a special topological configuration which is comprised of an exterior vortex ring and a central vortex ( or giant vortex ) due to the presence of central barrier [ see figures 7(b ) and 7(c ) ] . for large soc strength and small rotation frequency ,",
    "the visible vortices tend to be elongated along the radius and linked one after another [ figure 7(d ) ] . when the rotation frequency increases , the elongated effect of the visible vortices becomes deformed and eventually disappears , and the final topological structure of the system is similar to that in the initially miscible case . from figure 2 to figure 7 , we show that the rich topological structures of the rotating toroidal becs with soc are determined by the interplay among the soc , the rotation frequency , and the interatomic interactions , especially for the soc strength .     becs with soc in a toroidal trap , where @xmath97 .",

    "the main reason is that for large rotation frequency @xmath154 the @xmath27-direction vortex string resulted from the combined effect of 1d soc and rotation can only carry partial angular momentum and the remain angular momentum is inevitably carried by the central giant vortex and the transverse vortices beside the @xmath88 axis .    , @xmath144 , arg@xmath155 , arg@xmath123 , @xmath156 , and @xmath157 , respectively .",

    "it is well known that the spin domain wall for a nonrotating two - component condensate system is a typically classical neel wall , where the spin flips only along the vertical direction of the wall .",
    "however , our numerical simulation  of the spin texture shows that in the region of spin domain wall the spin flips not only along the @xmath28 direction ( the vertical direction of domain wall ) but also along the @xmath27 direction ( the domain - wall direction ) , which implies that the observed spin domain wall is a new type of domain wall .",
