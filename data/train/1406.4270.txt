    "elastic manifolds in random media are one of the most important model systems in the statistical physics of disordered systems , which exhibit disorder - dominated pinned phases with many features common to glassy systems @xcite .",
    "likewise , the depinning of an elastic manifold from a disorder potential under the action of a driving force is a paradigm for the non - equilibrium dynamical behavior of disordered systems capturing the avalanche dynamics of many complex systems if they are driven through a complex energy landscape @xcite .",
    "in particular , the problem of a directed line ( dl ) or directed polymer ( i.e. , an elastic manifold in @xmath0 dimensions ) in a random potential and driven by a force has been subject of extensive study @xcite . at zero temperature",
    ", there is a threshold force , at which the manifold changes from a localized state with vanishing mean velocity to a moving state with a non - zero mean velocity .",
    "the depinning transition has been treated within the framework of classical critical phenomena by functional renormalization group techniques starting from the more general problem of depinning of @xmath1-dimensional elastic interfaces ( with @xmath2 corresponding to lines ) . in @xmath3 dimensions ,",
    "`` critical '' exponents at depinning can be calculated by functional renormalization using dimensional regularization in an @xmath4-expansion @xcite .    at finite temperature ,",
    "there is experimental evidence for a creep motion at any non - vanishing driving forces which can be understood qualitatively as thermally activated crossing of energy barriers which result from an interplay of both elastic energies of the line and the disorder potential .",
    "the energy of dls such as flux lines , domain walls , wetting fronts is proportional to their length ; therefore , the elastic properties of directed lines are governed by their line tension , which favors the straight configuration of shortest length . here",
    ", we concentrate on stiff directed lines ( sdls ) , whose elastic energy is given by the curvature of the line and , thus , represents a bending energy .",
    "this gives rise to configurations which are locally curvature - free and straight but , in contrast to the dl , the straight segments of sdls can assume any orientation even if this increases the total length of the line .",
    "there are a number of applications and interesting general theoretical issues concerning sdls in random media .",
    "the overdamped equation of motion of a sdl is the ( fourth - order ) herring - mullins linear diffusion equation @xcite , which also describes surface growth governed by surface diffusion .",
    "the depinning dynamics of the herring - mullins equation in quenched disorder has been subject of a number of prior studies @xcite , whose findings ( e.g. , an unphysically small roughness exponent ) differ in part significantly from ours as we will point out below ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : prev ] ) .",
    "sdls also describe semiflexible polymers with contour lengths smaller than their persistence length for bending fluctuations , such that the assumption of a directed line is not violated @xcite .",
    "our results can be applied to the depinning dynamics of semiflexible polymers such as dna or cytoskeletal filaments like f - actin in a random environment , such as a porous medium , as long as the correlation length of the depinning transition is smaller than the persistence length . as in other semiflexible polymer phase transitions ( such as adsorption )",
    "non - universal quantities such as the value of the depinning threshold itself will be governed by the bending elasticity . at the depinning transition , where the correlation length diverges , semiflexible polymers will exhibit a crossover to critical properties of effectively flexible lines ( dls ) with a segment length set by the persistence length .",
    "moreover , static sdls in a random potential feature a disorder - driven localization transition at finite temperatures already in @xmath0 dimensions @xcite . due to an interesting dimensional shift in the problem , an analogous transition occurs for dls only in higher dimensions . in principle",
    ", this offers an opportunity to observe new phenomena arising from an interplay of depinning and delocalization for sdls ( the disorder used in refs .",
    "@xcite does not feature such a transition in the static problem ) .",
    "the localization transition at a finite temperature also offers the opportunity to test the usage of static quantities in the treatment of creep motion , because the sdl is not pinned by disorder above the critical temperature .",
    "a lot of the progress for the depinning theory of dls has been based on two basic theorems due to middleton @xcite , which essentially state that a forward moving dl can only move forward and will stop in a localized configuration , if such exists .",
    "this allows for an unambiguous time - ordering of a sequence of states . we will show that these theorems do not hold for the sdl , which can be seen as a consequence of the next - to - neighbor terms that are introduced by the bending elasticity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present the model and the relevant equations of motion in sec .",

    "we conclude with a summary of our results in sec.[sec : concl ] .",
    "a general approach to driven elastic manifolds starts from @xmath5 dimensional manifolds with an elastic energy @xmath6 as an external pulling force @xmath7 intrinsically couples to only one transversal displacement component @xmath8 , there is no substantial gain in treating more than one transverse dimension , and we will restrict our analysis to this case .",

    "we are mostly interested in the simplest case of lines with @xmath2 .",
    "the order of the derivative @xmath12 distinguishes different kind of elasticities , @xmath13 is the directed line ( dl ) with tensional elasticity , and @xmath14 is the stiff directed line @xcite ( sdl ) with bending elasticity .",
    "the equilibrium statistics of the sdl and dl model are related as there is a mapping of the sdl to the dl model in higher transverse dimensions in problems with short - ranged potentials @xcite . in an earlier work we extended this mapping between sdl and dl in short - ranged random potentials @xcite . in the context of polymers ,",
    "the sdl model is often used as a weak - bending approximation to the so - called worm - like chain or kratky - porod model @xcite , which is the basic model for inextensible semiflexible polymers , such as dna , cytoskeletal filaments like f - actin , or polyelectrolytes .",
    "the weak - bending approximation is only applicable on length scales below the persistence length @xmath15 , where tangent fluctuations @xmath16 remain small .",
    "the persistence length contains thermal and disorder contributions as discussed in refs .",
    "additionally , there is a relation of the sdl model to surface growth models , on which we will comment below .    in suitable units ,",
    "the overdamped equation of an elastic line with an elastic energy @xmath17 as in can be written as @xmath18 at zero temperature .",
    "the first term on the right hand side represents the elastic forces as obtained from variation of the elastic energy .",
    "the force @xmath7 denotes a static , uniform pulling force , which tends to depin the line from the disordered medium , and @xmath19 is a quenched force due to the disordered medium . for this quenched force",
    "we distinguish two cases in the following , random - field and random - potential disorder . for random - field ( rf ) disorder",
