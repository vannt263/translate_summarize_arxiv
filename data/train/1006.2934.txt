    "quantum turbulence @xcite consists of a disordered tangle of reconnecting superfluid vortex filaments .",
    "because of quantum mechanical constraints on the rotational motion , these filaments carry the same quantized ( fixed ) circulation @xmath0 and are very thin : the ( fixed ) vortex core radius , @xmath1 , is much smaller than the average distance between the filaments , @xmath2 .",
    "quantum turbulence is easily created by agitating superfluid helium ( @xmath3he ) with propellers @xcite , grids @xcite , forks @xcite or wires @xcite , by applying a heat flow @xcite or by injecting a stream of ions @xcite .",
    "it is also studied in superfluid @xmath4he - b @xcite and , more recently , in atomic bose - einstein condensates@xcite .",
    "if the temperature is relatively large ( more than @xmath5 in @xmath3he ) , the turbulent kinetic energy contained in the superfluid vortices is transferred by the mutual friction @xcite into the viscous gas of thermal excitations ( the normal fluid ) and then decays into heat ; therefore a constant supply of energy ( continuous stirring for example ) is needed to maintain the intensity of the turbulence . if the temperature is relatively small ( less than @xmath5 in @xmath3he ) , the normal fluid is negligible , but , despite the absence of viscous dissipation , the turbulence still decays @xcite .",
    "the kelvin - waves cascade @xcite was proposed to explain this surprising effect .",
    "a kelvin wave is a rotating sinusoidal or helical displacement of the core of vortex filaments away from its unperturbed position @xcite .",
    "the dispersion relation of a kelvin wave of angular frequency @xmath6 and wavenumber @xmath7 along a straight vortex is @xcite    @xmath8    where @xmath1 is the vortex core radius and @xmath9 is the modified bessel function of order @xmath10 . in the long - wavelength approximation ( @xmath11 )",
    ", the angular frequency reduces to @xmath12 where @xmath13 is euler s constant ; the negative sign in this expression means that the kelvin wave propagates in the direction opposite to the orientation of the unperturbed vorticity .",
    ".  [ eq : kelvin ] was originally derived for a thin , hollow ",
    "cored vortex in a perfect euler fluid ; a similar expression was obtained for a vortex in a bose  einstein condensate @xcite . the simplified dispersion formula @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a constant , is often used in the kelvin - waves cascade literature .",
    "the kelvin - waves cascade is the process in which the nonlinear interaction of kelvin waves creates waves of shorter and shorter wavelength @xmath16 . at high enough temperature",
    "the mutual friction would quickly damp out the shorter kelvin waves @xcite , but at low temperatures the cascade proceeds unhindered , until @xmath7 is large enough that sound is efficiently radiated away ( phonon emission ) by rapidly rotating vortices @xcite .",
    "there is thus an analogy between the kelvin - waves cascade in quantum turbulence ( where the energy sink is acoustic ) and the kolmogorov cascade @xcite in classical turbulence ( where the energy sink is viscous ) .",
    "it is thought that in superfluid helium at low temperatures both the kolmogorov cascade and the kelvin - waves cascades operate at the same time @xcite .",
    "let @xmath17 be the vortex line density ( vortex length @xmath18 in the volume @xmath19 ) of a homogeneous isotropic vortex tangle , and @xmath20 be the average intervortex spacing . the kolmogorov cascade ( which in a classical fluid is often described as the break up of eddies @xcite ) involves rearrangements or partial polarisation@xcite of vortex lines over length scales of wavenumbers @xmath21 .",
    "the kelvin - waves cascade occurs on individual vortex filaments for wavenumbers @xmath22 .",
    "recent work has raised the possibility of the existence of a bottleneck @xcite between the two cascades , for which energy would pile up at some length scale of the order of @xmath2",
    ".    direct evidence of the kolmogorov cascade in superfluid helium was provided by the experiment of maurer and tabeling @xcite .",
    "numerical evidence is also convincing : the kolmogorov @xmath23 energy spectrum has been seen in calculations performed using both the schwarz filament model @xcite and the gross  pitaevskii equation @xcite which describes a bose - einstein condensate . on the contrary ,",
    "the kelvin - waves cascade is less understood ; there is no direct observation of it , and the theory is mired in a controversy between approaches proposed by lvov , nazarenko and collaborators @xcite on one hand , and by kozik and svistunov @xcite on the other .",
    "the two theories predict similar kelvin - waves amplitude spectra , but differ on matters of principles and in some important details .    lacking direct experimental evidence of the kelvin - waves cascade and its properties",
    ", experimentalists currently attempt to identify indirect but observable effects of the cascade and of any bottleneck ; for example they study the temperature dependence of the observed effective kinematic viscosity @xcite .",
    "the results are still inconclusive .",
    "the aim of our work at this stage is not to review or compare rival theories , but to add information .",
    "we present results of numerical calculations of the kelvin - waves cascade .",
    "the few published calculations differ in details ( e.g. whether the initial vortex is curved or straight , whether the cascade is forced continuously or results from an initial condition - either an artificially imposed cusp or a dynamically resolved vortex reconnection ) .",
    "more information is therefore necessary to learn the main physical features of the turbulent kelvin - waves cascade and to assess which results are robust .",
    "in particular we shall focus the attention to the magnitude and spectrum of the kelvin waves , the statistics of the vortex curvature and the fractal dimension .",
    "finally we note that , in presenting our results , we shall pay particular attention to how well energy is conserved in a given numerical approximations . in the absence of mutual friction , vortex evolution in between vortex reconnection events and without a turbulent cascade which radiates sound ,",
    "energy should be conserved ; yet previously published numerical calculations of the evolution of superfluid vortex filaments do not report how well the conservation law is satisfied .",
    "hereafter we use parameters which refer to superfluid @xmath3he : circulation @xmath24 and vortex core radius @xmath25 , but our results can be generalised to turbulence in low temperature @xmath4he - b . following schwarz @xcite , we describe vortex filaments as space curves @xmath26 where @xmath27 is arc length and @xmath28 is time . in the absence of mutual friction and of any externally applied superflow ,",
    "the self - induced velocity of a superfluid filament at the point @xmath29 is given by the biot - savart law    @xmath30    the line integral extends over the entire vortex configuration @xmath31 , which is discretised into a large number of points @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the singularity at @xmath34 is removed in a standard way by considering local and non - local contributions to the integral .",
    "if @xmath32 is the position of the @xmath35 discretization point along the vortex line , eq .  [ eq : bs ] becomes @xcite    @xmath36    here @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the arclengths of the curve between points @xmath39 and @xmath32 and between @xmath32 and @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is the original vortex line without the section between @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "for simplicity we assume that the cutoff parameter is @xmath42 .",
    "other de - singularization techniques are also used in the fluid dynamics literature@xcite .",
    "the number of discretization points , @xmath43 , changes with time .",
    "as the simulation progresses , new discretization points are introduced to maintain the resolution along the vortex filament .",
    "if the separation between two points , @xmath44 and @xmath40 , becomes greater than some threshold @xmath45 ( which we call the minimum resolution ) , we introduce a new point at position @xmath46 given by @xmath47    where @xmath48 . in this way",
    "@xmath49 , that is to say the insertion of new points preserves the curvature .",
    "points are removed if their separation is less than @xmath50 , to ensure that our shortest length - scale is fixed .",
    "the above algorithms ensure that the separation of vortex points along a filament lies between @xmath50 and @xmath45 .    for accuracy ,",
    "we approximate all spatial derivatives using @xmath51 order finite difference schemes which account for varying mesh sizes along the vortex filaments @xcite .",
    "let @xmath32 be the @xmath35 point on the vortex filament ; the two points behind have positions @xmath52 and @xmath39 , and the two points in front have positions @xmath40 and @xmath53 .",
    "we denote @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .",

    "the maximum curvature is of the order of @xmath83 . at each time step",
    "we compute the local curvature @xmath84 at each discretization point @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) if , at some location along a vortex filament , the local curvature exceeds the critical value @xmath87 ( @xmath88 of the maximum value @xmath83 ) , points are removed and the filament is smoothed locally .",
    "this leads to a loss of line length , hence a loss of energy .",
    "it must be stressed that we are not interested in the phonon emission per se , but rather in the consequence of the presence of an energy sink on the kelvin waves cascade .",
    "the actual numerical value of @xmath45 is chosen for numerical convenience and is orders of magnitude larger than the microscopic lengthscales which are physically relevant to phonon emission and vortex reconnections .",
    "therefore our model contains ( and controls ) a mechanism of dissipation , and is different in scope from vortex methods dedicated to perfect euler dynamics . in the next section",
    "we describe results obtained with two different spatial resolutions : @xmath89 ( high resolution ) and @xmath90 ( low resolution ) .",
    "we shall see that our results are independent of the resolution used .",
    "time evolution is based on a @xmath91 order adams  bashforth scheme .",
    "consider an evolution equation of the form @xmath92 .",
    "we time - step the equation according to @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the time step and the superscript @xmath10 refers to the time @xmath95 @xmath96 .",
    "lower order schemes are used for the initialisation , when older velocity values are not available .",
    "the time step @xmath94 is chosen so that the period @xmath97 of the fastest kelvin wave ( which has wavenumber @xmath98 ) contains at least 25 time steps ; we have verified that reducing our time step further gives the same results .",
    "if two discretization points become closer to each other than the local discretization distance , our numerical algorithm reconnects the two filaments @xcite subject to the criteria that the total length ( as proxy for energy ) decreases @xcite . in this way the same quantity @xmath45 controls both energy dissipation mechanisms in our model - sound emission and reconnections .",
    "self - reconnections ( which can arise if a vortex filament has twisted and coiled by a large amount ) are treated in the same way .",
    "since reconnections involve only anti - parallel filaments , prior to reconnection we form local ( unit ) tangent vectors @xmath99 , where @xmath27 is arc length , and , using the inner product , we check that the two filaments are not parallel .",
    "finally , we remove any small loops with less than three discretization points .    during the evolution",
    "we monitor the length @xmath18 and the kinetic energy @xmath100 ( in unit of the density ) of the vortex configuration ; the latter is    @xmath101    if the calculation is performed in a periodic box , the vortices can extend across the boundaries ; the only way to compute the energy integral is to discretise the integrand on a three  dimensional spatial grid , computing the velocity at each grid point ; unfortunately this procedure converges too slowly to be practical .",
    "however , if the calculation is performed in an infinite volume , the vortex filaments are closed loops . assuming that the velocity field decays to zero at infinity",
    ", the energy integral can be transformed into a line integral @xcite    @xmath102    which converges much better . in writing eq .",
    "[ eq : e ] we have used the fact that the vorticity @xmath103 is concentrated on the vortex filaments ( @xmath104 ) .    in the absence of mutual friction , during biot - savart evolution ( but not during vortex reconnections , and not while the kelvin - waves cascade is in progress with the associated sound emission which we model ) , the kinetic energy @xmath100 is conserved , hence changes in @xmath100 measure the accuracy of the numerical method .",
    "our current method conserves energy about a factor of ten better than our preliminary unpublished calculations .",
    "the energy - conserving properties of previous calculations in the superfluid literature is unknown .    unlike the energy @xmath100",
    ", the vortex length @xmath18 is not conserved . however , if the biot - savart law is replaced by the local induction approximation ( lia ) , the length is conserved .",
    "the lia was used in the original work of schwarz @xcite and by others to reduce the computational cost .",
    "we do not use the lia in our calculations .",
    "a quantity which is particularly interesting is the normalized histogram ( probability density function , of pdf for short ) of the curvature @xmath105 , sampled on the discretization points : we call this quantity @xmath106 .",
    "in the first set of numerical experiments we consider a single vortex filament set across a periodic box as in fig .  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "the initial shape of the vortex is not straight , but is perturbed by two sinusoidal kelvin waves of amplitude @xmath107 and different wavelengths @xmath108 .",
    "we compute the time evolution and observe that that this initial condition does not yield a cascade to shorter waves .",
    "however , if we start with three parallel vortex filaments ( each filament with two kelvin waves ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](left ) , we notice that , as the vortices rotate around each other , they become more wiggly , see fig .",
    "[ fig:2](right ) .",
    "this result suggests that , besides vortex reconnection events ( as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the kelvin - waves cascade can be initiated , more in general , by the interaction of nearby curved vortices via the velocity field which they induce on each other .",
    "the result is also consistent with wave - turbulence theory @xcite , which states that , for one  dimensional waves obeying a dispersion law of the form @xmath14 , a four - waves process is not sufficient to generate a cascade . according to the theory ,",
    "the minimal initial condition for the cascade consists of three waves which satisfy the resonant condition that @xmath109 and @xmath110 , where indices @xmath111 and @xmath112 refer to incoming and outgoing waves respectively . the initial condition shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](left ) contains more waves than the minimal number of waves ( if it contained only the minimal number of waves we would need to seek the exact resonant condition , which is not our purpose at this stage ) .    in order to pursue this investigation more quantitatively",
    ", we want to monitor the kinetic energy of the vortex configuration . unfortunately , as we have mentioned in section  [ ii ] ,",
    "if the vortex configurations is set in a periodic box , it is not possible to accurately determine its energy .",
    "hereafter , in order to use eq .",
    "[ eq : e ] , we consider only closed vortex loops contained in an infinite volume .    in a second set of numerical experiments",
    "we start with a single vortex ring in an infinite volume ; the ring is seeded with two kelvin waves , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] . during the time evolution",
    "we observe that the waves interact , but there is no cascade , consistently with    the evolution of the vortex line of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] . indeed ,",
    "if we examine the pdf of the curvature , we notice that @xmath106 does not evolve in time to larger values of @xmath113 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4](top ) . unlike the vortex line in the periodic box of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , now we can monitor how well the kinetic energy is conserved in our numerical calculations . fig .",
    "[ fig:4](bottom ) shows that the relative change of energy during the time evolution of this non - cascading vortex configuration of interacting kelvin waves is only @xmath114 percent .",
    "this value describes how well we can integrate euler dynamics .",
    "proceeding in analogy with fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , we now consider a third set of numerical experiments with three vortex rings oriented in the same direction as shown in the first snapshot of fig .  [ fig:5 ] ; each ring is initially perturbed by two random kelvin waves .",
    "this set - up contains enough waves to trigger the kelvin - waves cascade and allows us to carefully monitor the energy .",
    "the initial total number of discretization points is @xmath115 ; at the end of the calculation at time @xmath116 we have @xmath117 .",
    "the minimum distance between discretization points is set to @xmath118 .",
    "all three rings are oriented in the same way , hence they travel in the same ( negative @xmath119 ) direction , leapfrogging around each other .",
    "this simple vortex bundle configuration evolves into a kelvin - waves cascade : fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] shows that during the evolution the wiggliness of the vortices increases .",
    "this is in agreement with the straight vortices of fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] . since the wiggly vortices of fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] are relatively close to each other , there are many reconnections up to time @xmath120 , less reconnections between @xmath121 , and no reconnection afterwards .",
    "the reconnections do not appear to affect the vortex configuration in a significant way : the vortex bundle seems structurally robust .",
    "we start our analysis of the kelvin - waves cascade by noticing that it induces a stretching of the vortices : fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] shows that the relative increase of vortex length is @xmath122 .",
    "this effect ( the transformation of part of the interaction energy into length ) is in agreement with previous calculations of reconnecting vortex bundles performed using the gross - pitaevskii model @xcite .    the behaviour of the energy @xmath100 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] . during the initial stage of the evolution ( @xmath123 ) the energy slightly declines ,",
    "then it becomes approximately constant , with relative fluctuations @xmath124 of less than @xmath125 .",
    "the energy fluctuations are larger than for non - cascading vortex configurations , because in the cascading case the presence of short , rapid kelvin waves induces rapid velocity fluctuations .",
    "[ fig:8](top ) and fig .",
    "[ fig:8](bottom ) show respectively the maximum speed @xmath126 and the maximum acceleration @xmath127 sampled over the discretization points @xmath128 @xmath129 .",
    "it is apparent that velocity fluctuations are larger during the initial stage of the cascade ( @xmath130 ) .",
    "we shall return to why the energy initially decreases after discussing the vortex curvature .",
    "[ fig:9 ] shows the time evolution of mean , maximum and minimum curvature , @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 , sampled over the discretization points @xmath85 .",
    "[ fig:9](top ) shows that @xmath131 undergoes a rapid initial rise , then slowly decays , almost settling down .",
    "[ fig:9](bottom ) shows that the maximum curvature is always much less than the maximum value of curvature allowed by the numerical resolution , which is @xmath134 and is represented by the dashed line .",
    "the curvature pdf is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] . note that , as time progresses , @xmath106 moves to the right towards larger values of @xmath113 .",
    "this effect must be compared against the much smaller movement to the right of the curvature pdf for the non - cascading vortex configuration which is showed in fig .",
    "[ fig:4](top ) .",
    "numerical experiments suggest that @xmath106 is indeed a convenient quantity to monitor if one looks for evidence of the kelvin - waves cascade . at later stages ,",
    "as energy is lost at small scales , we observe that the turbulence decays , as in the experiments @xcite , and the curvature pdf moves to smaller values of @xmath113 .",
    "it is also interesting to note in fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] that , after an initial transient , the curvature pdf assumes a power law dependence @xmath135 for large values of @xmath113 .",
    "[ fig:11 ] shows that the exponent @xmath136 quickly settles down to the average value @xmath137 . in the low resolution run ( @xmath89 ) a similar calculation gives @xmath138 , which confirms that our results are independent of the numerical resolution .",
    "we can now return to the question as to why there is a small energy loss during the initial stage of the evolution from @xmath139 to @xmath140 in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] .",
    "our numerical algorithm has two mechanisms through which length , hence energy , can be lost : vortex reconnections and smoothing of regions of high curvature . which is more important ?",
    "to find the answer we repeat the calculation with the vortex reconnection algorithm switched off .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:12 ] . if we compare the energy computed with reconnections ( fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] ) and without reconnections ( fig .",
    "[ fig:12](top ) ) we see that @xmath100 is more constant without reconnections .",
    "it is also instructive to compare curvature statistics computed with reconnections ( fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] ) and without reconnections ( fig .",
    "[ fig:12 ] , bottom three graphs ) .",
    "it is apparent that vortex reconnections are the most important energy sink at large @xmath7 : without reconnections , the maximum curvature @xmath132 is much larger , and often reaches the numerical limit represented by the horizontal dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig:12](bottom ) .",
    "since @xmath133 is approximately the same , @xmath131 is also larger than in the reconnecting case .",
    "therefore , without vortex reconnections the cascade proceeds to the smallest scale which is numerically allowed , at which point the smoothing algorithm kicks in .",
    "we conclude that the initial energy loss shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] is due to the frequent reconnections which occur during the initial stage of the evolution .",
    "the next quantity of interest is the amplitude @xmath141 of the kelvin waves and the spectrum of the kelvin - waves cascade .",
    "following svistunov @xcite , we introduce the concept of _ smoothed vortex filament _ : at every time @xmath28 , we use every @xmath142 points as nodes of a cubic  spline interpolation to obtain a new ( smoothed ) filament , @xmath143 from the original discretised vortex filament @xmath85 @xmath129 .",
    "[ fig:13 ] ( top ) is an example of this procedure : in the figure we see the actual discretization points @xmath128 @xmath129 together with the smoothed line .",

    ".  [ fig:13](bottom ) , confirming that our numerical smoothing procedure is robust enough .",

    "this result validates the weak - turbulence theory approach to the kelvin - waves cascade problem@xcite .",

    "note the rapid increase of @xmath168 during the initial stage caused by reconnection events , followed by a decline due to the numerical dissipation at high wavenumbers which models physical dissipation ( sound emission ) .",
    "our numerical calculations show that the kelvin - waves cascade can be initiated by the interaction of neighbouring vortex lines as well as by vortex reconnections .",
    "we find that , shortly after an initial transient , the kelvin - waves cascade quickly settles in and saturates : fig .",
    "( [ fig:11 ] ) and fig .",
    "( [ fig:16 ] ) show that the slopes @xmath136 and @xmath153 of the curvature histogram at large @xmath113 , @xmath174 , and of the amplitude spectrum at large @xmath7 , @xmath175 , remain approximately constant .",
    "we also find that the kelvin - waves amplitude spectrum scales approximately as @xmath176 for large @xmath7 , in agreement with @xmath177 reported in ref .",
    "@xcite for a continuously excited vortex line , and less steep but in fair agreement with the theories of lvov , nazarenko and collaborators @xcite and of kozik and svistunov @xcite , who predict @xmath178 and @xmath179 respectively , where their kelvon occupation number @xmath180 is equivalent to our @xmath148 .",
    "the applicability of wave turbulence theory to the problem is supported by our finding that the angle @xmath156 between the smoothed vortex line and the actual line is small and has approximately a gaussian nature , see fig .",
    "[ fig:17 ] .",
    "the regime which we have identified in our calculation is clearly a weak turbulent regime , as demonstrated by the small angles between the smoothed vortex filament and the actual filament - see fig .",
    "[ fig:17](top ) .",
    "we think that in a stronger regime larger twists would appear and induce more self - reconnections than the few which we observe in fig .",
    "[ fig:20 ] . in",
    "must be stressed that our numerical cutoff effectively short - circuits the formation of loops at scales smaller than @xmath45 .",
    "the tendency of the vortex filaments to twist could be explored more in detail by examining the torsion , but we refrain from this calculation due to larger errors which would arise in computing third derivatives .",
    "a better approach would be to model the cascade more microscopically using the gross - pitaevskii equation , although the range of scales which would be available is limited .",
    "the possibility that the geometry of superfluid turbulence undergoes a qualitative change at low temperatures , where the friction can be ignored , was first considered by tsubota and collaborators @xcite .",
    "they noticed that if a vortex tangle is computed in the absence of the smoothing effect of the mutual friction , its appearance is `` kinky '' .",
    "further work @xcite showed that , even in the presence of a small amount of friction , the vortex tangle is a fractal object .",
    "this result stimulated the study of the relation between energy and length , and between energy and fractal dimension @xcite .",
    "the results which we present here show that , in its simplest form , the fracture nature of superfluid turbulence arises from the kelvin - waves cascade along individual filaments .",
    "the actual value of the fractal dimension depends on the level of acoustic dissipation of kinetic energy , which in our biot - savart simulations is modelled by the numerical dissipation via the parameter @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , for decaying turbulence as in our calculations , @xmath168 depends on time .",
    "the fact that we observe some secondary reconnections only in the evolution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:20 ] means that probably fractality is a general feature of the kelvin - waves cascade , not the result of a sequence of self - similar twisting and secondary reconnections ; it would be interesting to pursue this aspect of the problem with more computing power and a smaller @xmath45 .",
    "it is worth remarking that in classical fluid mechanics the relation between turbulence and fractals has been noticed for some time @xcite .",
    "finally we notice that there are aspects of what we have discussed which relate to classical fluid mechanics , particularly to the problem of the complexity of solutions of the euler equation for an inviscid incompressible fluid . in the absence of viscous dissipation ,",
    "classical vorticity can stretch greatly , and filamentary vortex structures may twist wildly@xcite , unable to reconnect , and may even tend to a blow - up in finite time .",
    "but there are important differences between incompressible euler vortices and superfluid vortices .",
    "superfluid vortices reconnect , lose energy by radiating it away , and vortex volume is not conserved ( the superfluid vortex core radius is fixed by quantum mechanical constraints on the rotation ) .",
    "therefore lagrangian methods for classical flows and for superfluid flows differ in both scope and detail .",
    "for example , schwarz s de - singularization of the biot - savart integral does not involve a time - dependent core size .",
    "another example is the cutoff @xmath45 , which models sound dissipation and the reconnecting distance . in our case , dissipation and reconnections",
    "are essential ingredients of the problem , and the numerical method must model their existence . in the classical case , dissipation and reconnections",
