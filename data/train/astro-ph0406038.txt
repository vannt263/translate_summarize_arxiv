    "this paper is the second of a pair that uses a sample of mainly b - type stars to probe the interstellar medium of the disc and halo of the milky way in caii k ( @xmath1=3933.663  ) . in the first ( smoker et al .",
    "2003 ; hereafter paper 1 ) , we considered the abundance of caii k , variations in the element over degree scales , and the distribution of this species as a function of distance from the galactic plane ( @xmath3 ) . in the current work ,",
    "we use the 88 sightlines in our sample , plus new observations towards three other stars , to search for caii k absorption in gas in intermediate and high - velocity clouds , the purpose being to try and improve the distance limits to these still enigmatic objects .    intermediate and high velocity clouds ( hereafter ihvcs ) are objects with absolute values of their velocities in the local standard of rest ( lsr ) of between @xmath240100 and @xmath8 @xmath2 100 kms@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "these velocities are not explicable by simple rotation of gas around the galactic centre , and hence it has been postulated that the clouds are either material within the galactic halo at distances of @xmath215 kpc ( e.g. review by wakker & van woerden 1997 ; putman et al .",
    "2003 ) , or objects left over from the formation of the milky way , with distances of several hundreds of kpc ( blitz et al .",
    "1999 , braun & burton 1999 ) . both types of object have been extensively studied in hi , although until recently , the ionised component of the clouds remained uncertain .",
    "this situation has been rectified by results from the wisconsin h@xmath9 mapper ( wham ) that indicate that ihvcs contain ionised gas ( e.g. haffner , reynolds & tufte 2001 ; smoker et al .",
    "2002 ; tufte et al .",
    "2002 ) , the ionisation being caused by either collisional ionisation , photoionisation by the extragalactic ionising field , and/or the escape of photons from the disc of the galaxy . to attempt to determine which is the most likely source of ionisation",
    ", the distance to ihvcs would be of great help , as to the present - day , there is still a dearth of distance measurements , particularly towards hvcs ( wakker 2001 ) .",
    "the current paper once more attempts to address this issue , by searching for ihvc components in the caii line of a sample of mainly early - type stars , located in the galactic disc and halo .",
    "the description of the reduction and analysis of the majority ( 88 ) of these stars was described in paper 1 , with new observations towards a further 3 objects being described in this paper .",

    "three stars towards ivc complex k were observed , pg numbers 1718 + 519 , 1725 + 252 and 1738 + 505 , which were reduced using standard methods to obtain the equivalent widths ( ews ) and velocity centroids of the caii k components . the signal to",

    "fig . [ fig1 ] shows both the complete wavelength coverage , and the caii k line only , towards the three pg stars .",

    "the caii k interstellar reduced equivalent width of low - velocity material towards the three sample stars ( = @xmath11sin(@xmath12 ) ) is 90 , 96 and 119 m .",
    "given a caii k scaleheight of @xmath2 800 pc and rew at infinity of @xmath2115 m ( paper 1 ) , this indicates that the stars are quite distant .",
    "of the three objects , pg1718 + 519 turned out to be a binary , whose spectrum is contaminated by a late - type companion star .",
    "pg1725 + 252 is an early - type star with a stellar velocity of @xmath136 kms@xmath5 .",
    "the ` intermediate velocity ' line at @xmath14 kms@xmath5 is hence likely to be stellar .",
    "this was checked by running a model atmosphere code using a solar calcium abundance with t@xmath15=26,000 k , log@xmath16=5.0 ( theissen et al . 1993 ) and microturbulance velocity of 0 and 5 kms@xmath5 .",
    "these produced equivalent width estimates of 44 and 65 m , similar to the measured value of 40@xmath175 m .",

    "these values were obtained via gaussian profile fitting using elf within dipso ( howarth et al . 1996 ) . in the northern hemisphere , the hi values",

    "the version of the villa - elisa survey that we have used has been corrected for the effects of stray radiation . in this case ,",
    "linear interpolation of the four nearest profiles was performed . in the region of overlap between the two surveys we used the leiden - dwingeloo data .    in the case where optical absorption is detected ,",
    "column 10 gives the lsr velocity assuming that the feature is due to caii k , with column 11 giving either the log(caii column density in @xmath18 ) of the ihvc , or ( more frequently ) its upper limit from the current dataset .",
    "given the instrumental full width half maximum resolution , @xmath19 , the observed snr in the continuum , @xmath20 , was used to calculate a limiting equivalent width in  , @xmath21(caii ) , thus ;    @xmath22    typically , the spectra have a instrumental resolution of 0.1 and snr=30 , which means that the calculated limiting equivalent width is on the order of 20 m , which is compatible with visual inspection of the spectra .",
    "once this limiting equivalent width has been estimated , it can be used to determine the limiting column density @xmath23 , assuming that we are on the linear part of the curve of growth , viz ;    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the wavelength in  and @xmath26 is the oscillator strength of caii k , taken to be 0.634 ( morton 1991 ) .",

    "note that using this relationship only gives an approximate estimation of the real caii column density because ; 1 ) the hi column density is derived from a large beam and does not take fine - scale structure into account , 2 ) the h - to - ca ratio varies somewhat from cloud - to - cloud , 3 ) the h - to - ca ratio may vary within clouds and 4 ) we are using @xmath28 and not @xmath29 .",
