    "the strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma at rhic / lhc is believed to be described appropriately by hydrodynamics at proper times @xmath0 .",
    "one solution to hydrodynamics describing a relativistic system with infinite extent in the perpendicular direction that is expanding longitudinally was given by bjorken @xcite .",
    "an important probe for the strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma is the quenching of quark and gluon jets  @xcite .",
    "a useful tool to study real time dynamics of a particle within a strongly coupled medium is the holographic approach . modeling jet quenching of ultrarelativistic quarks and gluons in holography by light rays falling towards a static black hole in holography",
    "was initially suggested in  @xcite and more recently in  @xcite .",
    "jet quenching of ( non-)relativistic quarks and gluons has been described by trailing strings  @xcite and trailing and falling strings  @xcite ; see also @xcite . for another approach to jet quenching within holography see @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of quark jets at early stages of their evolution was studied in @xcite .",
    "falling strings are commensurate with falling light rays in the ultrarelativistic limit bridging the gap between the two approaches .    the trailing string solution reveals momentum and energy dispersion relations for a heavy quark being dragged through a static , hot medium at a constant velocity . for a thermal medium described by a static black hole ,",
    "the drag coefficient following from the longitudinal tension of the dragged string is in agreement with expectations from brownian motion  @xcite thanks to the einstein relation .",
    "the trailing string configuration can be thought of as the locus of the time delay of a light signal propagating along the jet direction in bulk .",
    "indeed , static quarks and gluons are threaded by a vertical color string in the holographic direction .",
    "as they are made to move longitudinally in space , the vertical string follows causally with each point at a given holographic depth traveling with the speed of light corrected by the refraction index of the holographic medium . as a result",
    ", the string traces the locus of time delays  @xcite .",
    "this particular interpretation was made clear in  @xcite .",
    "the surface of stationary phase of the solution to electromagnetic waves ( more precisely @xmath1-current ) propagating in bulk is identical to the trailing string solution .",
    "we make use of this particular interpretation to construct trailing string solutions in a time dependent black hole background , which is dual to a time dependent expanding thermal plasma that asymptotes bjorken hydrodynamics . our explicit string construction supplements and confirms the non - equilibrium analysis of quark dragging in  @xcite .    in section 2",
    "we show how to obtain the trailing string solutions by following light rays propagating in bulk . instead of using the full maxwell description of electromagnetic waves as in @xcite , it suffices to study null geodesics in bulk as originally suggested in  @xcite in order to reproduce the solution to the string equations of motion .",
    "this eikonal approximation holds for trailing strings in a static as well as expanding hot medium . in section 3",
    ", we then construct the trailing string solution in a time dependent , thermal background , which describes an expanding , hot medium , that asymptotically agrees with bjorken s solution for large proper times . energy and momentum dispersion relations , as well as the drag coefficient are obtained . another trailing string solution to this setup",
    "was worked out in @xcite , which we briefly review in the appendix .",
    "the energy scaling of the stopping distance for a quark jet in holography was studied in @xcite . in section 4",
    "we approximate the stopping distance for an ultrarelativistic light quark jet by analyzing a classical particle falling in bulk on a null trajectory .",
    "our conclusions are given in section 5 .",
    "motivated by the earlier idea on radiation in holography @xcite and the recent wave analysis in  @xcite , we propose a simple way to construct the trailing string solution by looking at null geodesics in bulk .",
    "we will now show that the solution to the string equations of motion , which is a string dual to a heavy quark moving on the boundary with constant velocity @xmath2 , is given by the envelope of the endpoints of light rays emitted from the quark at the boundary at an earlier time @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the time ( delay ) it takes light to travel along a null geodesic from the boundary ( @xmath5 ) to some finite @xmath6 in bulk .",
    "the position of the string extending into the bulk is equal to the position of an observer who has first detected the light signal emitted from the boundary at an earlier time .",
    "we illustrate this in fig .",
    "[ figure ] .",
    "we parametrize the position of the light ray by @xmath7 with @xmath8 an affine parameter .",

    "can now be written as @xmath24 to regain the solution to the string equations of motion @xcite with @xmath25 a constant .",

    "corrections of the order @xmath64 will show up in the infrared behavior of the solution . in ( [ actionconstantvelocity ] )",

    "@xmath65 is easily worked out ; @xcite .",

    "the equation of motion ( [ eomseparable1 ] ) reads @xmath73 and yields the solution to the string @xmath74 the on - shell action is proportional to @xmath75 . at the boundary , @xmath76 , representing a heavy quark at constant velocity .",
    "integrating the canonical energy and momentum densities @xmath77 @xcite , the total energy and momentum of the string in the @xmath78-coordinate system are given by @xmath79 with @xmath80 the static solution @xmath81 defines the static thermal mass @xmath82 as @xmath83 the static solution , as well as the non - static one above , has dirichlet boundary conditions , implying that the endpoint of the string does not vary with @xmath84 .",
    "this requires @xmath85 .",
    "as the black hole moves away from the boundary ( @xmath86 ) in the @xmath87-frame , the endpoint of the string has to reflect this dynamic behavior . at large times",
    "the medium is described by ( bjorken ) hydrodynamics satisfying the assumption of near local equilibrium .",
    "static properties of the quark are insensitive to the changes in the medium as the thermal mass correction , @xmath88 , is constant in time . interpreting @xmath89 as a screening mass , we would expect it to be proportional to @xmath90 .",
    "the associated energy and momentum flow of the string are @xmath91 ignoring corrections @xmath64 , the energy and momentum dispersion relations and flows are @xmath92 with @xmath93 , and @xmath94 .",
    "@xmath95 is the maximum depth beyond which @xmath64 corrections can no longer be neglected .",
    "note that although the string endpoint falls in the @xmath87-frame , the energy flow down the string is independent of the radial coordinate .",
    "while the total energy of the quark is constant in the ( @xmath96)-frame , the momentum decreases with time.as the external electric force @xmath97 weakens with time , the quark loses momentum and is asymptotically static .",
    "( note that the medium does not expand in the @xmath60 direction . )",
    "we can now evaluate the drag coefficient @xmath98 .",
    "the momentum flowing away from the quark on the boundary reads @xmath99 for a quark momentum @xmath100 we obtain the drag coefficient @xmath101 this is analogous to the momentum loss in a static background with a constant temperature @xmath102 , where the drag is governed by @xmath103 , @xcite .",
    "the result ( [ dragcoefficient ] ) is also in agreement with the brownian motion analysis carried in  @xcite for a falling black hole and using different approximations .",
    "for a relativistic light quark jet traveling through an ( expanding ) medium , we give an estimate for the maximum penetration depth .",
    "a light quark is approximately described by a null string whose endpoint is initialized at some finite radial coordinate and falls into the black hole following a null geodesic @xcite .",
    "the approximation used is that long enough after the initialization , once the endpoints of the string have traveled from the boundary to some depth @xmath104 , the quarks flying away from each other can be represented by trailing string solutions , where the string uniformly translates with a constant velocity and its endpoints follow null geodesics .",
    "the excitation on the boundary will dissolve into the medium once the endpoints of the string have reached the horizon and the energy scaling of the stopping distance is @xmath105 .",
    "+ following the classical approximation used in @xcite , we approximate the maximum stopping distance of a relativistic particle on the boundary by following light rays in bulk .",
    "we first consider the case of a static medium , whose dynamics are described by the metric in ( [ adsmetric ] ) . to describe a quark on the boundary with velocity @xmath21",
    ", we fix the constants of motion , ( [ xdot ] ) , @xmath106 the null geodesic reads @xmath107 and the distance @xmath108 the quark travels before the string reaches the horizon is given by @xmath109 for ultrarelativistic motion , @xmath110 and finite @xmath111 , the energy dependence of the maximum penetration depth reads @xmath112 where we have assumed a dispersion relation of the form @xmath113 .",
    "the result in ( [ penetrationdepth ] ) agrees with the one found in @xcite , @xmath114 , where @xmath115 was identified with the virtuality of the classical particle .",
    "however , the disperion relation for the string , compare ( [ energydispersionrelationconstant]),([energydispersionrelationconstant2 ] ) , supports the identification @xmath116 . for very heavy quarks @xmath117",
    "can be identified with the bare quark mass .",
    "it would be interesting to compare these two results @xmath118 and @xmath119 with current experimental data on heavy quark jets at rhic and lhc .",
    "similarly , at late times in an expanding background , ( [ metric ] ) , where the quark on the boundary moves close to the speed of light with @xmath120 , the maximum stopping distance is given by @xmath121",
    "falling black holes in the context of holographic qcd offer a new framework for studying strongly coupled gauge theories out of equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "heavy quark diffusion in such a context was originally discussed in  @xcite using certain assumptions .",
    "the current analysis through the trailing string confirms these findings without additional assumptions .",
    "key to the construction of the trailing string solution in the time dependent holographic background is the observation that the string in bulk is the locus of the light delays  @xcite .",
    "the falling black hole in bulk asymptotes bjorken hydrodynamics , describing a longitudinally expanding plasma with infinite extent in the perpendicular spatial direction .",
    "the time - delayed and approximate solution to the string equations of motion accounts for a quark at constant velocity .",
    "furthermore , an exact solution exists , representing a decelerated quark at the boundary with an asymptotically vanishing momentum ( see appendix ) .",
    "since the holographic metric can be expressed in a coordinate frame in which the horizon is fixed in proper time , the essentials of the expanding medium are captured by a time dependent rescaling of the temperature .",
    "a falling black hole from @xmath122 to @xmath18 describes an expanding and cooling medium from @xmath123 to @xmath124 .",
    "heavy quarks with initial thermal masses @xmath125 are dragged with a dragging coefficient @xmath126 .",
    "the latter is the analog of the dragging in a static medium with fixed temperature .",
    "ultrarelativistic , on - shell quarks with energy @xmath127 penetrate a distance @xmath128 in the expanding plasma .",
    "this work was supported in parts by the us - doe grant de - fg-88er40388 .",
    "in this appendix we show that the falling black hole background ( [ metric ] ) also admits an exact , decelerated trailing string , which exhibits identical dragging to the trailing string solution discussed in the text .",
    "this solution was worked out in @xcite .",
    "the equation of motion for a solution of the form @xmath129 reads @xmath130 and gives the same result as in ( [ eomxi1 ] ) @xmath131 and , thus , @xmath132 @xmath25 is related to the initial position of the string endpoint .",
    "the on - shell action density corresponding to  ( [ separablesolution1 ] ) is given by @xmath133 . since @xmath134 , the quark moving along the trajectory of the endpoint of the string at @xmath5 is decelerated . the string solution ( [ separablesolution1 ] )",
    "describes a trailing string and every point on the string moves with the same velocity in the @xmath135-direction in the @xmath136 frame .",
    "this is no longer true if we transform to the original variables @xmath87 , since the black hole horizon is falling in these coordinates .",
    "the deceleration of the quark is proportional to the rate at which the temperature decreases , @xmath137 .",
    "for the solution in ( [ separablesolution1 ] ) , the densities read @xmath138 resulting in the following dispersion relations using ( [ energy ] ) , ( [ momentum ] ) @xmath139 for both the decelerated and the constant velocity solution , @xmath21 is related to the initial quark velocity .",
    "the energy dispersion relations ( [ energydispersionrelationdecelerated ] ) and ( [ energydispersionrelationconstant ] ) have the same structure , ensuring that both string solutions describe the same excitation on the boundary .",
    "since both solutions probe the same medium , it is not surprising , that we obtain the same drag coefficient as in ( @xmath140 ) for a quark having momentum @xmath100 .",
