    "the importance and difficulty of solving models of interacting quantum particles is hard to overstate .",
    "it is well known that the correlated motion of those particles gives rise to a wide variety of physical phenomena at different length and time scales , spanning disciplines like chemistry , condensed matter , nuclear , and high energy physics .",
    "novel complex structures can emerge as a consequence of the competing multiple - length scales in the problem .",
    "nonetheless , only a reduced set of interacting problems admits exact closed form solutions @xcite and the use of numerical techniques becomes essential if one is looking for accurate solutions not subjected to uncontrolled approximations . among those techniques , the statistical methods @xcite offer the potential to study systems with large number of degrees of freedom , reducing the computational complexity from exponential to polynomial growth",
    "this scaling behavior is particularly relevant when one recognizes that most of the interesting phenomena in many - body physics occurs in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , for fermions ( i.e. quantum particles obeying fermi statistics ) the sign problem plagues all useful stochastic algorithms and causes the variance of computed results to increase exponentially with increasing number of fermions @xcite .    on the other hand , the growing interest in physical systems whose state functions are defined on a general metric space makes the quantum mechanics of interacting particles in curved manifolds no longer a mere intellectual exercise , but one with very practical consequences .",
    "perhaps the most well - known examples can be found in cosmology ( e.g. , matter in strong gravitational fields , atomic spectroscopy as probe of space - time curvature @xcite ) , but the subject is certainly not exclusive to this field . in condensed matter",
    "a very elementary case is provided by a deformed crystal .",
    "less well - known ones are mesoscopic graphitic microtubules and fullerenes .",
    "all these physical systems are ubiquitous in nature and the crucial role the curvature of the manifold plays has been confirmed by experimental observations ( e.g. spectrum of collective excitations @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the development of stable quantum methods with polynomial complexity in riemannian manifolds represents a real challenge for many - body theorists .    the present manuscript deals with the ( non - relativistic ) many - particle schrdinger equation in a general metric space and its solution using stochastic techniques .",
    "in particular , we will show how to construct approximate solutions ( wave functions ) for systems with broken time - reversal symmetry ( e.g. electrons in the presence of external electromagnetic sources ) avoiding the infamous `` phase problem '' @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty is to define a probability measure ( semi - positive definite ) which allows one to get the complex - valued state with no asymptotic signal - to - noise ratio decay in euclidean time .",
    "this translates into a problem of geometric complexity , which is solved approximately using constraints in the manifold where the wave function has its support . in this way",
    ", we get stable but approximate solutions which can be systematically improved .    among the large variety of problems one can attack",
    ", we decided to choose the general problem of fermions in the presence of external gauge fields to illustrate the main ideas .",
    "the effects of an external magnetic field on a system of electrons can be profound @xcite .",
    "the field couples to the electron s charge and spin , modifying its spatial motion and lifting its spin degeneracies .",
    "the field can also create spatial anisotropy , effectively reducing the dimensionality of the system from three to two .",
    "the combination of the reduced dimension and the field itself is known to have novel consequences .",
    "for example , in a system of non - interacting electrons hopping on a square lattice , the field transforms the energy spectrum from the simplicity of trigonometric functions to the complexity of a field - dependent self - similar structure ( hofstadter s butterfly ) whose depth mathematicians are still fathoming @xcite .",
    "the combination of the reduced dimensionality , strong particle interactions and the field itself is known to have novel consequences , like the formation of isotropic fractional quantum hall fluids @xcite , which are incompressible states of the two - dimensional homogeneous coulomb gas .",
    "the projector ( zero temperature ) method we will introduce uses random - walks to solve a general multidimensional partial differential equation second order in space coordinates and first order in time . whenever mention is made of a random - walk we mean a markov chain that is defined as a sequence @xmath0 of @xmath1 random variables that take values in configuration space , i.e. the space of particle positions . as usual , what characterizes a random - walk is its initial probability distribution and a conditional probability that dictates the transition from @xmath2 to @xmath3 .",
    "this transition probability is non - unique and discretization dependent @xcite . among all the possible choices we will require a prepoint discretization of the transition probability ( short - time propagator ) because we will use monte carlo methods to generate the walkers .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ section2 ]",
    "we present the formulation of the general problem of fermions in curved manifolds .",
    "in particular , for illustration purposes and to fix notation , we develop the formalism for spin-@xmath4 particles in the presence of an external electromagnetic potential .",
    "then , we show how to project out the lowest energy state of a given symmetry in a manifold with curvature , and discuss the resulting fokker - planck equations for various distribution functions .",
    "once the problem is precisely defined we develop , in section [ section3 ] , path - integral solutions to those multidimensional differential equations , and give an interpretation of the emergent `` quantum corrections '' in the euclidean action .",
    "the path - integral solutions are evaluated using monte carlo techniques in section [ section4 ] .",
    "there , we provide an stable step by step practical algorithm which emphasizes the subtle changes ( with respect to the standard diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) technique ) due to the metric of the manifold . in section [ section5 ]",
    "we apply such computational implementation to the problem of an electron moving on the surface of a sphere in the presence of a dirac monopole .",
    "finally , section [ section6 ] summarizes the main findings and discusses the relevance of the stochastic method as applied to the physics of quantum hall fluids .",

    "it is worth emphasizing that our method can be applied to a wide variety of inhomogeneous systems ( e.g. , inhomogeneous semiconductors with a position dependent effective mass ) , not just systems on curved manifolds .",

    "this definition of quantum corrections is quite general and can be applied to _ any _ differential equation which is second order in space and first order in time , regardless of the number of dimensions or any spatial inhomogeneity in the system .    to illustrate the general methodology we have concentrated on the problem of interacting fermions in external electromagnetic potentials . in this case a variational upper bound to the exact ground state energy can be found by applying the fixed - phase approximation , where the fermionic problem is treated as a bosonic one by fixing the phase of the many - body wave function ( which is complex - valued in general ) by some trial phase . as an example , we have considered the problem of a single electron confined to the surface of a two - sphere , which has a magnetic monopole at its center .",

    "we have shown that the exact energies are reproduced within statistical accuracy thus proving that the approach for dealing with the quantum corrections is valid .",
    "as emphasized in the introduction , the method presented in this paper for performing dmc simulations on curved manifolds can be used to study many interesting physical systems .",
    "an important example is the quantum hall effect , a phenomenon which occurs when a two - dimensional electron system is placed in a strong magnetic field .",
    "as first pointed out by haldane @xcite , the electron - monopole system described in section v provides a convenient geometry for performing finite size numerical studies of quantum hall systems when many interacting electrons are placed on the sphere .",
    "this is in part because the spherical geometry has no boundary so that finite size effects are suppressed .",
    "in addition , the spherical geometry is conceptually simpler than the ( flat metric ) torus geometry , which also has no boundary , because the topological order exhibited by quantum hall states leads to certain nontrivial degeneracies on the torus @xcite .",
    "recently we have used the method developed in this paper to study some of the exotic excitations which occur in quantum hall systems , specifically the fractionally charged quasiparticle excitations of the fractional quantum hall effect @xcite , and the charged spin texture excitations ( skyrmions ) of the integer quantum hall effect @xcite .",
    "previous numerical studies of these excitations have been based on either vmc or exact diagonalization calculations which , for the most part , have assumed that the wave functions describing the excitations are confined to the lowest ( @xmath325 ) landau level .",
    "in fact , this is a rather poor approximation for real experimental systems which can exhibit significant mixing of higher landau levels due to the electron - electron interaction . because the fp dmc method allows one to go beyond the lowest landau level approximation",
    "it can be used to study the effect of landau level mixing on quantum hall states @xcite and , by employing the method described in this paper , we were able to perform such studies using haldane s spherical geometry .",
    "these simulations have provided useful quantitative results for various properties of quantum hall excitations for realistic experimental parameters @xcite . along with the more rigorous test case of the electron - monopole system described in this paper",
