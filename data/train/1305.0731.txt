    "over the past years , there has been a renewed interest in the analysis of the spectra and resolvents of non - selfadjoint operators with double characteristics .",
    "this interest finds some of its grounds in the study of the long - time behavior of evolution equations associated with non - selfadjoint operators @xmath0 this is for instance the case in the analysis of kinetic equations and the study of the trend to equilibrium in statistical physics .",
    "the study of doubly characteristic operators has a long and distinguished tradition in the analysis of partial differential equations @xcite .",
    "the simplest examples of such operators are given by quadratic differential operators @xmath1 with @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "in the elliptic case , the spectrum of these operators has been understood and described explicitly for some time  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the pseudospectral study of these operators is much more recent .",
    "studying the pseudospectrum of an operator is studying the level lines of the norm of its resolvent @xmath5 with the convention @xmath6 if @xmath7 belongs to the spectrum  @xmath8 of @xmath9 .",
    "the breadth of these sets allows to analyze the spectral stability of the operator under small perturbations .",
    "indeed , the pseudospectrum may be defined in an equivalent way  @xcite in terms of the spectra of the operator perturbations @xmath10 where @xmath11 stands for the set of bounded linear operators on @xmath12 .",
    "the pseudospectral study of a variety of operators has received much recent interest in a diverse array of problems . for further details and motivations ,",
    "we refer the reader to the overview of this topic presented in the book  @xcite , and to all the references therein . for now , let us simply notice that the study of the pseudospectrum is non - trivial only for non - selfadjoint operators , or more precisely for non - normal operators .",
    "in fact , the classical formula @xmath13 emphasizes that the resolvent of a normal operator can not blow up far from its spectrum , and that the spectrum is stable under small perturbations @xmath14 however , formula ( [ 1 ] ) does not hold anymore for non - normal operators and the behavior of the resolvent for such operators can be intricate by becoming very large in norm far from the spectrum . as a consequence , the spectrum of these operators may be very unstable under small perturbations .",
    "the rotated harmonic oscillator @xmath15 is a noticeable example of elliptic quadratic operator whose spectrum is very unstable under small perturbations .",
    "the seminal works  @xcite have indeed shown that its resolvent @xmath16 exhibits a rapid growth in some regions of the resolvent set far away from the spectrum , and that some strong spectral instabilities are developing in some regions with a specific geometry , which have been sharply described in the works  @xcite .",
    "these phenomena of spectral instabilities are not peculiar to the rotated harmonic oscillator .",
    "they were shown to be the typical behavior of any non - normal elliptic quadratic operator  @xcite , with a rapid resolvent growth along any ray lying inside the range of the weyl symbol of these operators .",
    "this is linked to some properties of microlocal non - solvability and to violations of the adjoint condition to the so - called nirenberg - treves condition @xmath17 , which allow the construction of quasimodes  @xcite .",
    "similar types of spectral instabilities were shown to occur for general pseudodifferential operators around a doubly characteristic point , when the quadratic approximations of these operators at the doubly characteristic set are non - normal  @xcite .",
    "starting from these early insights , there has been a series of recent works  @xcite intending to provide a sharp description of the spectral and pseudospectral properties of general pseudodifferential operators around a doubly characteristic point . in the present work",
    ", we aim at completing this picture and at describing the pseudospectral behavior of a general pseudodifferential operator around a doubly characteristic point by refining the understanding of the underlying geometry ruling these phenomena .",
    "let @xmath180,+\\infty[$ ] be an order function ( see dimassi - sjstrand s book @xcite ) , that is , @xmath19 with @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the euclidean norm .",
    "we consider the symbol class of @xmath22-dependent symbols whose growth is controlled by the order function @xmath23 given by @xmath24 in the present work , we study a semiclassical pseudodifferential operator @xmath25 defined by the semiclassical weyl quantization of a symbol @xmath26 admitting a semiclassical asymptotic expansion in the symbol class  @xmath27 , @xmath28 the symbols @xmath29 in the asymptotic expansion are supposed to be independent of the semiclassical parameter @xmath30 .",
    "we assume that the real part of the principal symbol is nonnegative @xmath31 and elliptic at infinity @xmath32 these two assumptions imply that there exists a neighborhood of zero in the complex plane such that the analytic family of bounded operators @xmath33 is fredholm of index @xmath34 , when the semiclassical parameter @xmath35 is small enough  @xcite .",
    "an application of the analytic fredholm theory shows that the spectrum of the operator @xmath36 in a small neighborhood @xmath37 of @xmath34 , that we may take of the form @xmath38 ( the open disk in @xmath39 centered at @xmath34 of radius @xmath40 ) , with @xmath41 , is discrete and is uniquely composed of eigenvalues with finite algebraic multiplicity .",
    "we assume further that the characteristic set of the real part of the principal symbol is reduced to a single point @xmath42 and that this point is doubly characteristic for the principal symbol @xmath43 @xmath44 so that we may write @xmath45 @xmath46 being the quadratic term in the taylor expansion of the principal symbol at  @xmath34 .",
    "we aim at studying the spectral and pseudospectral properties of the operator @xmath36 in a neighborhood of @xmath34 .",
    "as mentioned above , the study of this problem was started in  @xcite , where the first lines of this spectral and pseudospectral picture were sketched out .",
    "the results of  @xcite actually provide a first localization of the spectrum of the operator @xmath36 in any given @xmath22-ball centered at @xmath47 . more specifically , when the quadratic approximation of the principal symbol is elliptic on a particular vector subspace @xmath48 of phase space defined as its singular space , for miscellaneous facts about quadratic operators and the definition of the singular space . ]",
    "@xmath49 then , for any given constant @xmath50 and any fixed neighborhood @xmath51 of the spectrum @xmath52 of the quadratic operator @xmath53 described in the appendix ( section  [ appendix ] ) , there exist positive constants @xmath54 , @xmath55 such that for all @xmath56 , @xmath57 satisfying @xmath58 we have @xmath59 where @xmath60 stands for the value of the subprincipal symbol at the doubly characteristic point @xmath61 .",
    "this result indicates that the spectrum of @xmath36 in any @xmath22-ball centered at @xmath47 , is localized in an @xmath22-neighborhood of the spectrum of its quadratic approximation shifted by the value of the subprincipal symbol at the doubly characteristic point @xmath62 under the same assumptions , this pseudospectral picture was completed by the following result about the spectrum  @xcite : for any given @xmath63 , there exists @xmath64 , such that for all @xmath65 , the spectrum of the operator @xmath36 in the open disk @xmath66 is given by eigenvalues @xmath67 satisfying a semiclassical expansion of the type @xmath68 where @xmath69 is an eigenvalue of the quadratic operator @xmath70 located in the fixed ball @xmath71 , @xmath72 is the dimension of the corresponding generalized eigenspace , and the @xmath73 are some complex constants .",
    "we next consider the remainder term in the principal symbol @xmath74 and assume further the existence of a closed angular sector @xmath75 with vertex at 0 , and a neighborhood @xmath37 of the origin in @xmath76 such that @xmath77 when the quadratic approximation @xmath70 enjoys some subelliptic properties , sharp resolvent estimates may be derived outside an @xmath22-ball centered at @xmath47 , in a parabolic region with a particular geometry . more specifically , when the quadratic form @xmath46 has a zero singular space , i.e. @xmath78 , we consider the smallest integer @xmath79 satisfying @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the hamilton map of @xmath46 ( see the appendix , section  [ appendix ] ) .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that for any given sufficiently small constant @xmath82 there exist positive constants @xmath64 , @xmath83 , @xmath55 , such that for all @xmath56 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 , @xmath86 where @xmath87 the term @xmath88 increases when the spectral parameter @xmath7 moves away from the origin in the region where @xmath89 .",
    "when the spectral parameter is of magnitude @xmath22 , we recover the semiclassical estimate ( [ eq1.7 ] ) , and we emphazise that the resolvent estimate @xmath90 and the geometry of the parabolic region where it holds , are directly related to the loss of @xmath91 derivatives appearing in the global subelliptic estimate satisfied by the quadratic approximation of the operator at the doubly characteristic point ( see the appendix , section  [ appendix ] ) , @xmath92    [ des3.1 ]     is fulfilled when @xmath7 belongs to the dark grey region of the figure , whereas the estimate @xmath93 is fulfilled in the light grey one . ]",
    "these results show that the algebraic structure of the singular space allows to sharply account for the spectral and pseudospectral properties of pseudodifferential operators around a doubly characteristic point .",
    "the picture drawn so far has been recently completed by viola  @xcite . in these works , the author studies the case when the spectral parameter @xmath7 enters deeper into the numerical range and may grow slightly more rapidly than the semiclassical parameter  @xmath22 outside the parabolic region @xmath94 .",

    "furthermore , this result shows that the spectral parameter may enter logarithmically deeper into the numerical range outside the parabolic region  @xmath94 , @xmath111 while keeping a polynomial resolvent bound @xmath112    in the present work , we aim at completing this picture by investigating further the pseudospectral properties of the operator @xmath36 inside the @xmath22-neighborhood of the set @xmath113 more specifically , we study necessary and sufficient conditions for the following a priori estimates to hold : @xmath114 where @xmath115 is a positive integer , when @xmath7 belongs to a neighborhood of  @xmath116 .",
    "while the resolvent estimate ( [ ning4 ] ) and the geometry of the parabolic region ( [ sl1 ] ) were shown to be related to the subelliptic properties of the quadratic approximation @xmath70 , we show in this work that the resolvent estimates ( [ sl2 ] ) are actually linked to some properties of hypoellipticity with a big loss of derivatives .",
    "the proof of the main result of this article ( theorem  [ th1 ] ) is indeed based on a grushin - reduction method following closely and adapting to the semiclassical setting the approach developed by parenti and the first author in the study of hypoellipticity with a big loss of derivatives for operators with multiple characteristics  @xcite .",
    "we recall that the grushin - reduction method has proven itself fundamental in many different problems , especially in spectral theory and in the study of hypoellipticity ( and , more recently in the study of solvability and semi - global solvability @xcite ) for operators with multiple characteristics .",
    "the idea of grushin is roughly the following .",
    "let @xmath117 be a hilbert space and @xmath118 be a fredholm operator ( with a non - zero kernel ) of index @xmath34 .",
    "setting @xmath119 and @xmath120 , these vector subspaces must then have the same dimension @xmath121 .",

    "the latter is the weyl - quantization , in the normal directions to the characteristic set , of the relevant piece in the taylor expansion of the symbol at the characteristic points obtained by keeping track of the vanishing orders of its various parts .",

    "as already mentioned , this method has proven itself to be successful in the paper by sjstrand @xcite in which , for the first time , the hypoellipticity with a loss of one derivative ( and solvability ) for general pseudodifferential operators with multiple characteristics was studied .",
    "afterwards , in this line of problems , helffer @xcite studied the hypoellipticity with a loss of @xmath134-derivatives for operators with multiple characteristics . pushing the machinery of localized operators to all orders ( to describe the `` transport terms '' in the parametrix ) , parenti and the first author  @xcite studied the hypoellipticity with a big loss of derivatives for operators with multiple symplectic characteristics .",
    "they showed in particular that the various examples of @xmath135 hypoelliptic operators with multiple characteristics and loss of derivatives , such as the stein example , the christ flat - kohn example and others , where manifestations of the same phenomenon  @xcite .",
