    "the nonmesonic weak decay ( nmwd ) of @xmath15 hypernuclei , @xmath16 , takes place only within a nuclear environment with the decay rate @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) . without producing any additional on - shell particle",
    "( as does the mesonic weak decay @xmath19 ) , the mass is changed by @xmath20 mev , and the strangeness by @xmath21 , which implies the most radical modification of an elementary particle within the nucleus . at the same time it offers the best opportunity to study the strangeness - changing interaction between hadrons , and is the main decay channel for medium and heavy hypernuclei .    with the incorporation of strangeness ,",
    "the radioactivity domain is extended to three dimensions @xmath22 , which , because of the additional binding due to the @xmath15-hyperon , is even richer in elements than the ordinary @xmath23 domain .",
    "( for instance , while the one - neutron separation energy in @xmath24c is @xmath25 mev , it is @xmath26 mev in @xmath27c  @xcite . )",
    "this attribute of hypernuclei has motivated a recent proposal to produce neutron rich @xmath15-hypernuclei at the japan proton accelerator research complex ( j - parc ) , including @xmath28he  @xcite .",
    "important experimental efforts have been invested in hypernuclear weak physics during the last few years @xcite .",
    "the correlative theoretical advances in our knowledge of the nmwd , have been also quite significant @xcite . for recent review articles",
    "the ratio @xmath29 , together with the asymmetry parameter ratio @xmath30 for emission of protons from polarized hypernuclei  @xcite , has been in the past and still are the main concerns in the physics of nmwd . for a long time",
    "the large experimental value for the @xmath31 ratio ( close to unity ) remained unexplained .",
    "but , recent improved data tend to converge to @xmath32  @xcite , both for @xmath33he ( @xmath0-shell ) and @xmath34c ( @xmath35-shell ) , indicating similarity in the transition mechanism .    in the meantime",
    "the theoretical estimates of @xmath31 , done within the one meson - xchange ( ome ) model , have increased .",
    "for instance , parreo , and ramos  @xcite have found @xmath36he@xmath37 , and @xmath38c@xmath39 , when the exchanges of the complete pseudoscalar ( @xmath40 ) and vector ( @xmath41 ) meson octets are taken into account , with the weak coupling constants obtained from soft meson theorems and @xmath42  @xcite .",
    "the dominant role is played by the exchange of pion and kaon mesons , and when their effect is combined with the direct - quark ( dq ) model , the value of the @xmath43 ratio is increased up to @xmath44  @xcite .",
    "however , these transition mechanisms continue to predict too large and negative value for @xmath30 .",
    "there are two recent proposals to bring this value into agreement with experiments by going beyond the ome+dq models .",
    "the first considers incorporating new scalar - isoscalar terms induced by @xmath45-exchanges  @xcite .",
    "( see also refs .",
    "@xcite on the relevance of these terms . ) in the second , in addition to the model of @xmath46 exchanges , is introduced the axial - vector @xmath47-meson exchange  @xcite .",
    "quite recently we have discussed the parameter @xmath30 within the independent particle shell model ( ipsm ) , together with the @xmath0-wave approximation ( @xmath1 )  @xcite .",
    "the corollary of this study was that , independently of the nmwd dynamics , this observable has the same value in all hypernuclei that have totally full proton subshells , such as @xmath33he and @xmath34c , and very likely also in the remaining hypernuclei .",
    "this result is a direct consequence of the fact that @xmath30 , same as @xmath31 , is a ratio of two transition rates , which makes it , in absence of final state interactions ( fsi ) , dependent purely on the dynamical features of the nmwd .",
    "the aim of this work is twofold .",
    "first , we establish the link between the theoretical formalism for the nmwd of the @xmath0-shell hypernuclei originally introduced by block and dalitz  @xcite , and the general formalism used presently for any type of hypernuclei .",
    "second , we show that the ipsm framework , together with the @xmath1 , allow us to formulate the rates @xmath17 within the @xmath48   shells in terms of the @xmath0-shell nuclear matrix elements ( nme ) .",
    "previous research in this direction has been done by alberico , and garbarino  @xcite and by cohen  @xcite .",
    "later on , it is demonstrated that regardless of the decay mechanism : i ) all hypernuclei with the same number of protons and neutrons ( with @xmath49 should have the same ratio @xmath31 , ii ) the value of this observable increases ( decreases ) as the neutron ( proton ) excess is enlarged , and iii ) simple analytic relationships exist between @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath31 in different hypernuclei with the same mass number @xmath50 .",
    "the derivation of these results , same as those on the parameter @xmath30",
    "@xcite , is based on the assumption that the emission of the nucleons @xmath51 from different single - particle states is affected in a similar way by the fsi .",
    "then , before presenting the formalism , it might be convenient to comment on the relationship between the ratio @xmath52 and the fsi .",
    "the primary partial decay rates @xmath17 are in principle derivable from the measurements of emitted nucleons @xmath53 and @xmath51 spectra .",
    "these are : i ) the single - nucleon spectra @xmath54 , as a function of one - nucleon kinetic energies @xmath55 , and ii ) @xmath56 coincidence spectra @xmath57 , and @xmath58 , as functions of the sum of kinetic energies @xmath59 , and the opening angle @xmath60 , respectively . from these spectra",
    "are determined the numbers of protons n@xmath61 , and neutrons n@xmath62 , and numbers of pairs n@xmath63 , and n@xmath64 , which are not related in a simple way with @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "this is because not all primary nucleons , originated by the nmwd , are measured . in propagating within the nuclear environment",
    "they interact with the surrounding nucleons , and in some cases they change their momenta , and energies , some of them even can be absorbed by the medium , and emission of additional ( secondary ) nucleons can take place as well  @xcite .",
    "all these processes represent a complicated many - body problem , and are generically designated as fsi . to describe them , keeping the calculations feasible , are",
    "indispensable model assumptions , and the fsi are usually simulated by a semi - classical model , developed by ramos  @xcite , and called the intranuclear cascade ( inc ) model .",
    "this model interrelates the rates @xmath65 , and @xmath66 with the numbers n@xmath62 , n@xmath61 , n@xmath63 , and n@xmath64 , and therefore , as stressed recently by bauer and garbarino @xcite , the fsi described by the inc model should not be included in the evaluation of decay rates @xmath65 , and @xmath66 .",
    "however , not all fsi are considered within the inc model , and which additional fsi contribute to the nmwd spectra and decay rates , and how and which of them should be included in the calculation are nontrivial questions .",
    "some candidates are as follows :    \\(i ) short range correlations ( srcs ) acting on final @xmath56 states ; here one starts from the plane wave approximation for the outgoing nucleons and the srcs are incorporated _ a posteriori _ , either phenomenologically through jastrow - like src functions , or by solving the bethe - goldstone equation .",
    "the first approach is used within both nuclear matter  @xcite , and finite nuclei calculations  @xcite , and the second one only in the shell - model - type calculations  @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) self - energy and vertex particle - hole corrections , and rpa - like rescattering effects ( see , for instance , the diagrams ( b)-(d ) in fig . 2 of ref .",
    "it is not known whether these fsi contribute coherently or incoherently , and it can even happen that ( b ) and ( c ) cancel out , as do the divergences in the vertex , and fermion self - energy corrections in the qed , because of the ward identity .",
    "( something similar happens also in the nuclear particle - phonon - coupling model . )",
    "the first ones can be associated with the mean - field effects on the single - particle wave functions engendered by an energy - dependent complex optical potential  @xcite .",
    "\\(iii ) interactions of the deep - hole states ( which become highly excited states in the continuum after the nmwd ) with more complicated configurations ( @xmath67 , collective states , ) , which spread their transition strengths in relatively large energy intervals  @xcite .",
    "there is no theoretical study in the literature on the nmwd encompassing all aspects of the fsi .",
    "the development of a microscopic many - body model for the fsi described by the inc model would be also extremely welcome , and so far only in refs .",
    "@xcite were the first steps taken toward this goal .",
    "finally , the two - body induced nmwd @xmath68 , which has been recently measured @xcite , should be also considered .",
    "briefly , the issue of fsi is a tough nut to crack , and a lot of theoretical work has to be done still , particularly in relation to the recently measured spectra @xmath54 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58  @xcite , which are certainly affected by them .",
    "however , as the purpose of the present contribution is not to make progress in this direction , among all possible fsi , only the srcs will be considered here .",
    "this is done phenomenologically , and initial @xmath69 state srcs are included on the same footing  @xcite .",
    "it is our belief that this is a fair approximation for the objectives of the present work .",
    "to derive the nmwd rate within the ipsm we start with the fermi golden rule . for a hypernucleus , in its ground state with spin @xmath70 and energy @xmath71 , decaying to : i ) several states @xmath72 in the residual nuclei with spins @xmath73 and energies @xmath74 , and ii ) two free nucleons @xmath53 and @xmath51 , with momenta @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , kinetic energies @xmath77 , and @xmath78 , and total spin @xmath79 , reads  @xcite @xmath80 where for sake of simplicity we have suppressed the magnetic quantum numbers .",
    "the nmwd dynamics , contained within the weak hypernuclear transition potential @xmath81 , will be described by the ome model .",
    "the wave functions for the kets @xmath82 and @xmath83 are assumed to be antisymmetrized and normalized , and the two emitted nucleons @xmath53 and @xmath51 are described by plane waves .",
    "initial and final srcs are included phenomenologically at a jastrow - like level , while the finite nucleon size effects at the interaction vertices are gauged by monopole form factors  @xcite .",

    "<S> using as a tool the @xmath0-wave approximation ( @xmath1 ) , this work demonstrates that the nonmesonic weak decay transition rates @xmath2 and @xmath3 can be expressed in all hypernuclei up to @xmath4si ( and very likely in heavier ones too ) in the same way as in the @xmath0-shell hypernuclei , as a linear combination of only three elementary transition rates . </S>",
    "<S> this finding leads to the analytic prediction that , independently of the transition mechanism , all hypernuclei that are on the stability line ( @xmath5 ) , @xmath6he , @xmath7li , @xmath8be , @xmath9b , @xmath10c , @xmath11o , @xmath4si ,   should roughly have the same ratio @xmath12 , the magnitude of which rapidly increases when one approaches the neutron drip - line ( @xmath13 ) , and opposite happens when one goes toward the proton drip - line ( @xmath14 ) . </S>"
