    "over the latest years a great deal of work and effort has been done in the direction of understanding canonical noncommutative field theories and quantum mechanics ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the recent interest in these theories is motivated by works that establish a connection between noncommutative geometry and string theory @xcite .",
    "intensive research is carried out to investigate their interesting properties , such as the ir - uv mixing and nonlocality @xcite , lorentz violation @xcite , new physics at very short distances @xcite , and the equivalence between translations in the noncommutative directions and gauge transformations ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "several investigations have been pursued to verify the possible role of noncommutativity in a great deal of cosmological scenarios . among them",
    "we quote newtonian cosmology @xcite , cosmological perturbation theory and inflationary cosmology @xcite , noncommutative gravity @xcite , and quantum cosmology @xcite . in a previous work @xcite , an investigation into the influence of noncommutativity of the minisuperspace variables in the early universe scenario",
    "was carried out for the kantowski - sachs universe .",
    "although noncommutativity effects proved to be relevant to the universe history at intermediate times , they were shown not to be capable of removing the future and past cosmological singularities of that model in the classical context . in the quantum context ,",
    "on the other hand , non - singular universe solutions were shown to be present . however , since they exist for the commutative quantum kantowski - sachs universe , their presence in the ensemble of solutions of the noncommutative quantum model can not be attributed to the noncommutativity effects .",
    "although the investigation carried out in @xcite was restricted to a particular model , one expected that some of the results obtained there could be of general validity .",
    "indeed , in this work we shall show that noncommutativity can appreciably modify the evolution of the friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe with a conformally coupled scalar field @xcite .  as in reference @xcite ,",
    "our investigation is carried out by means of a comparative study of the universe evolution in four different scenarios : classical commutative , classical noncommutative , quantum commutative and quantum noncommutative .",
    "the main motivation for the choice of the conformally coupled scalar field is that it admits exact solutions in the simpler cases discussed along this work and it is rich enough to be useful as a probe for the significant modifications noncommutative geometry introduces in classical and quantum cosmologies .",
    "the analytical treatment renders easy the study of the singular behavior of the model in its four versions .",
    "as we shall show later , even in the classical context noncommutative geometry can remove singularities .",
    "moreover , depending on the value of the noncommutative parameter , noncommutative classical models can mimic quantum effects .    as an interpretation for quantum theory",
    ", we are adopting the bohmian one , which we briefly review in section 4 .",
    "originally proposed by bohm  in 1952 @xcite , and further developed by him in a collaboration with hiley @xcite , such an interpretation of quantum theory has acquired an increasing number of adepts along the years @xcite .",
    "decisive contributions for the development of the  bohmian quantum physics were made by bell @xcite , who was its arduous defender for three decades , by holland @xcite , and by  d. drr , s. goldstein and n. zangh ( see , e.g. , @xcite-@xcite and ref . therein ) . due to the capability it has to reproduce the experimental results of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory providing an intuitive interpretation of the underlying dynamics ,",
    "bohmian quantum physics is presently an issue of interest for broad community ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in this work the main reason that compels us to adopt the bohmian interpretation in quantum cosmology is the absence of external observers in the primordial quantum universe , which renders the standard copenhagen interpretation inapplicable in its description . as an alternative ,",
    "the bohmian interpretation has been employed  in several works of quantum cosmology and  quantum gravity  ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "other  interesting  aspect of the bohmian approach to quantum theory , which motivates us for its adoption ,  is the efficient framework it provides for comparison between the classical and quantum counterparts of a physical  model in the common language of trajectories .",
    "we shall benefit from this facility in our comparative study of the four versions of the frw universe . since our preference for bohmian interpretation",
    "is justified for technical , rather than philosophical reasons , we shall not focus our discussion on fundamental questions regarding the interpretation of quantum theory ( for references on this subject see @xcite ) . instead",
    ", whenever possible ,  we shall give preference for the interpretation - independent aspects .",
    "this work is organized as follows .",
    "sections 2 and 3  are devoted to a comparative study of the classical  frw with a conformally coupled scalar field and its noncommutative counterpart . in section 4 we present the commutative  quantum version of the model , and analyze it by using the bohmian formalism of quantum trajectories .",
    "a similar study is carried out in sections 5 and 6 , which are concerned with the noncommutative quantum version of the model . in section 7",
    "we end up with a general discussion and summary of the main results .",
    "as a reference for the identification of the noncommutative effects later , it is interesting to consider first the commutative classical frw universe , which we describe as follows .",
    "we shall restrict our considerations to the case of constant positive curvature of the spatial sections .",

    "the qualitative  behavior of the universe solutions in noncommutative quantum cosmology was discussed in section 4 , where examples were presented that contain non - singular periodic solutions , non - singular solutions presenting one bounce , as well as non - singular solutions containing an infinite sequence of bounces enveloped by a larger bounce . when noncommutativity effects are turned on in the quantum scenario , they give rise to dynamical universes in situations where bohmian quantum cosmology admits only static universes .",
    "one example is that of real wavefunctions , which in the noncommutative frw model with a conformally coupled  scalar field represent always non - singular bouncing universes .",
    "noncommutativity effects can also induce a dynamical behavior yielding non - singular periodic universes in cases where the commutative counterpart is static and the noncommutative wavefunction is complex .",
    "an example was presented in section 6 .",
    "the investigation into the nc - c - frame correspondence revealed that , even in the classical context , the description of the universe evolution provided by these two possible scenarios for the realization of noncommutativity can differ radically . in section 3",
    "we showed that for some values of the integration constants the universe can be non - singular in the nc - frame , while its c - frame counterpart is singular .",
    "an example of the drastic difference that can occur between the nc- and c - frame realizations was exhibited in that section for the case where @xmath59 .",
    "it consists of a universe that is non - singular in the nc - frame and that has no correspondent in the c - frame , where it is at all times singular .    in the quantum context",
    "the distinction between the nc- and c - frame descriptions was shown to be as relevant as it is in the classical one .",
    "an example was worked out that discusses how a universe with large @xmath267 in the nc - frame can correspond to two universes in the c - frame , one with large @xmath268 @xmath267 , and other with very small @xmath269 .",
    "such an interplay between small and large scale distances was previously reported in @xcite , where it was interpreted as a sort of ir - uv mixing , in analogy with noncommutative field theory .",
    "other examples involving the nc - c - frame correspondence were presented and solved numerically for the case @xmath191 and analytically for the case @xmath73 . again",
    "the case where @xmath59 provided an interesting example .",
    "when @xmath59 noncommutativity effects  act to drop the kinetic term from the wheeler - dewitt equation .",
    "this justifies the poor and highly constrained dynamics found in this case .",
    "no matter what is the wavefunction in this case , if the initial conditions are non - singular  the universe is non - singular and experiments a single bounce in both nc- and c - frame descriptions ( fig .",
    "@xmath270 ) .    in case noncommutativity of the minisuperspace variables",
    "has in fact played a role in the evolution of the primordial universe , as proposed in @xcite , the study carried out in this work renders evident the need of an ontology in order to have a clear picture of the essential features of the noncommutative  universe models .",
    "the correspondence between degrees of freedom in two different frames of realization is not sufficient to define the theory completely , which is only fixed by assuming one of them as the physical frame .",
    "this necessity seems not to be an exclusive feature of the cosmological model considered here , where the dramatic difference in the universe evolution can be attributed , in part , to the fact that the noncommutativity in question is that of the system s degrees of freedom - the minisuperspace variables- . in the  models where noncommutativity does not involve directly the system s degrees of freedom , as the canonical noncommutative field theories that come from string theory @xcite ,",
    "the study of the correspondence between the nc- and c - frame descriptions is also a relevant subject . in the context of gauge theories , where the connection between the nc- and c- frames is via the seiberg - witten map , an investigation into the properties of the theory that have resemblance with gravity was carried out , e.g. , in @xcite , where the equivalence between spacetime  translations and gauge transformations is shown to occur in the nc - frame . in the c - frame , on the other hand , where such an equivalence seems to be lost ,",
    "noncommutative fields can be interpreted as ordinary theories immersed in a gravitational background generated by the gauge field , as shown in the interesting work by rivelles @xcite , and further in @xcite .",
