    "it has also been applied to the elastic scattering of fast n atoms from a ( 111 ) silver surface , for which asymmetries in the diffraction patterns might be originated by second atomic layer effects in the surface potential @xcite .    due to the strong dependence of the interference patterns on the atom - surface interaction , a crucial issue of",

    "it corresponds to a perpendicular energy , associated with the movement normal to the surface , @xmath57mev . under this incidence condition",

    "( [ t - eik ] ) an integration region @xmath16 equal to @xmath59 reduced unit cells , are displayed in the figure with a blue dashed line .",
    "these results present narrow bragg maxima placed at @xmath60 , with @xmath61 an integer number and @xmath62 the distance between parallel atomic rows along the incidence channel , whose positions coincide with those of the experimental maxima . within the se approach",
    ", the width of these bragg peaks is governed by the number of reduced unit cells along the perpendicular direction , @xmath63 ( in our case , @xmath64  ) , decreasing as @xmath65 increases , while their intensities are determined by the supernumerary rainbow distribution , as explained below .",
    "the two different mechanisms - bragg diffraction and supernumerary rainbows - that are present in gifad patterns @xcite can be analyzed separately with the se model .",
    "the se transition matrix can be factorized as @xcite @xmath66where @xmath67 is derived from eq .",
    "( [ t - eik ] ) by evaluating the @xmath18-integral over _ one _ reduced unit cell , and @xmath68 , with @xmath69 , for incidence along the @xmath46 $ ] and @xmath1 $ ] directions .",
    "the factor @xmath70 , associated with supernumerary rainbows , is produced by interference between projectile trajectories whose initial positions are separated by a distance smaller than @xmath62 . in turn ,",
    "@xmath71 , which gives rise to the bragg peaks , is due to interference between projectile trajectories whose initial positions are separated by a distance just equal to a multiple of @xmath62 .",
    "the positions of bragg peaks , indicated with vertical dashed lines in figs . 3 and 4 , provide information about the crystallographic structure only ,  but their intensities , which are modulated by the supernumerary rainbow factor @xmath70 , depend strongly on the shape of the pes across the incidence channel .",
    "in fact , the factor @xmath67 completely determines the number and the intensity of observed bragg maxima , even suppressing them , as approximately happens for the bragg peaks of order @xmath72 in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .    in order to compare with the experimental data , in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] we also plot se differential probabilities convoluted with a lorentz function ( red solid line ) to simulate the experimental conditions",
    ". the parameters of the line broadening are taken from the observed linewidths , as stated in ref . @xcite .",
    "such a convolution takes into account not only the experimental divergence of the incident beam but also the broadening introduced by both thermal vibrations of lattice atoms and inelastic processes , which contribute to spoil the coherence @xcite .",
    "we found a good agreement between the convoluted se results and the experiment in the whole range of perpendicular momenta , with the exception of the maxima of order @xmath73 whose intensity is overestimated by the se curve .",
    "this fact is related to the sharpness of the rainbow peaks of the envelope function @xmath67 , which is originated by the classical description of the projectile motion that does not include the finite intensity on the dark side of the classical rainbow @xcite .",
    "such classical rainbow maxima affect the intensity of the outermost bragg peaks of the gifad pattern only when they are close to each other , as observed in the figure .",
    "however , this deficiency does not influence the se distribution at smaller transverse momenta .    the final perpendicular momentum distribution of a he beam impinging along a less corrugated crystallographic channel - the @xmath1 $ ] channel - is shown in fig . [ fig:3 ] for the incidence parameters @xmath74ev and @xmath75 ( i.e. , a perpendicular energy @xmath76mev ) . here ,",
    "se results obtained by considering initial positions inside @xmath77  unit cells are plotted in the figure together with  the convoluted values .",
    "the se momentum spectrum , including experimental and inherent uncertainties through convolution , is in fairly good accord with the experimental data .",
    "notice that the @xmath78 position of the classical rainbow peak depends on @xmath79 , and for this incidence condition it is again close to the outermost bragg maximum . on the other hand ,",
    "the number of observed bragg maxima is determined by @xmath67 , being sensitive to the potential contour across the incidence direction .",
    "then , as a consequence of the much lower corrugation of the channel , observed in fig",
    ". [ fig:0 ] , the projectile momentum spectrum is narrower than the one of fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] we compare experimental and theoretical diffraction charts for @xmath80kev @xmath47he atoms impinging on the silver surface along the @xmath52 $ ] channel .",
    "these diffraction charts display the intensity of the projectile distribution as a function of the transverse transferred momentum and the incidence angle @xmath81 ( or the normal impact energy ) , providing an overall scenery of the gifad patterns for this low - indexed crystallographic direction .",
    "the experimental diffraction chart of fig . [ fig:4 ] ( a ) was obtained by considering intensity distributions corresponding to 38 different incidence angles . like in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , as a consequence of the low corrugation of the channel , only three diffraction orders - @xmath82 and @xmath72 - are visible in the figure .",
    "however , since the number of observed bragg maxima depends strongly on the shape of the equipotential curves across the incidence channel @xcite , and different values of @xmath83 allow one to probe such potential contours for different distances to the surface , the general agreement between the experimental and simulated two - dimensional diffraction charts of fig .",
    "fig:4 is a signature of the quality of the present dft potential in the @xmath84 - @xmath85 ev range of perpendicular energies .",
    "gifad patterns for helium atoms colliding with a silver surface are used to test both the se approach and the _ ab initio _ dft surface potential , for the case of a metal target .",
    "the se approximation takes into account the quantum interference produced by the coherent superposition of transition amplitudes for different projectile paths that end with the same final momentum , while the _ ab initio _ potential was obtained from dft by making use of the quantum espresso  code .    for the he - ag(110 ) system , experimental momentum spectra along different crystallographic directions display defined interference structures that are fairly well reproduced by the theoretical results . taking into account the extreme sensitivity of fast atom diffraction patterns , this agreement between se differential momentum probabilities and experimental data is indicative of the proper description of the atom - surface interaction given by the dft potential .",
