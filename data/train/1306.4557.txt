    "understanding the driving mechanisms of particle flux in tokamaks is of major importance in addressing the problem of fuelling a tokamak reactor and determining the particle confinement capabilities of future fusion devices .",
    "fusion power is proportional to the density of the fuel ions ( that is , linear in both deuterium and tritium densities ) , a peaked density profile of these ions is therefore highly desired . at the same time ,",
    "accumulation of impurities in the plasma core would lead to a deterioration of energy confinement due to radiative losses and significant dilution .",
    "it has been the focus of both experimental and theoretical efforts to find operating regimes which provide inward main ion and outward impurity particle flux .",
    "it has been pointed out by a number of authors that the effective turbulent particle transport in magnetized fusion plasmas is determined by a delicate balance between several contributing factors @xcite .",
    "the particle flux can be formally separated into a diffusive part explicitly proportional to the density gradient , a thermo - diffusive part proportional to the temperature gradient , and a residual term often called the particle pinch @xcite . in rotating",
    "plasmas an additional term , the rotodiffusion is also taken into account @xcite .",
    "these contributions have been analysed in detail by both quasi - linear fluid and gyrokinetic methods in terms of their dependences on magnetic shear @xcite , magnetic curvature @xcite , collisionality @xcite , impurity concentration and charge number @xcite , and whether the dominant instability driving the small scale turbulence is an ion or electron mode @xcite .",
    "in this paper we use the theoretical framework introduced in the publications above in order to understand the recent experimental observations on the frascati tokamak upgrade ( ftu ) following the installation of a liquid lithium limiter ( lll ) : discharges performed with lll exhibit significantly increased electron confinement properties and density peaking compared to the standard metallic limiter scenarios @xcite .",
    "similar observations have been made in various other tokamaks @xcite .",
    "one of the possible explanations for this behaviour is that the initial high concentration of lithium impurities alters the turbulent mode spectrum and the phase difference between fluctuations and thus leads to an inward anomalous particle transport , in contrast with the metallic limiter operation ( without lll ) .",
    "a linear gyrokinetic analysis of the ftu - lll discharge # 30582 performed with gkw @xcite using a lorentz - type collision operator ( pitch - angle scattering only ) was published by romanelli et al .",
    "they obtained the stabilizing effect of the lithium ions on the main itg modes due to dilution @xcite and on etg modes due to more effective screening of the potential fluctuations @xcite , and destabilization of the impurity itg modes .",
    "they found that in the linear phase the deuterium itg modes drive inward deuterium , electron and outward impurity flux at the early stage of the discharge .",
    "however , the direction of the transport remained unchanged when varying the density , temperature and temperature gradient of the species , and , most importantly , impurity concentration .",
    "it was therefore difficult to clarify the role of the lithium concentration in reversing the deuterium flux .    in this paper",
    "we extend the linear analysis of @xcite to include scans of collisionality and impurity density gradient , and compare non - linear simulations with experimentally measured fluxes",
    ". deuterium flux reversal between low and high impurity concentration cases in the linear simulations is found when the full collision operator is taken into account in the simulations .",
    "we also show that a centrally peaked , high concentration lithium profile is in fact responsible for the inward turbulent deuterium flux at the startup of the discharge , and that it also contributes to the electron density peaking by reducing the outward electron flux . a study by estrada - mila et al .",
    "@xcite has been investigating particle transport in a standard case using helium and tritium impurities with non - linear gyrokinetic analysis .",
    "we apply a similar approach for the analysis of this ftu discharge .",
    "the gyrokinetic analysis is complemented by a quasi - linear fluid model that contains the necessary physics needed to capture the main aspects of the observed particle transport .",
    "the fluid approach allows us to analyse all the eigenmodes of the system and estimate their diffusive , thermo - diffusive and pinch contributions to the particle flux separately .",
    "the validity of the linear and quasi - linear analysis is confirmed by a set of non - linear gyrokinetic simulations .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec : gk_lin ] the extended linear gyrokinetic analysis is presented and the key parameters leading to deuterium flux reversal are identified .",
    "non - linear simulation results supporting the main linear conclusions are also shown . in section",

    "it uses a linearized fokker  planck collision operator consisting of pitch - angle scattering , energy scattering and friction terms @xcite .",
    "the exact form of the collision operator is outlined in @xcite .",
    "energy and momentum conserving terms have not been included for these simulations since they are only important for neoclassical studies . since ftu",

    "are not expected to affect the main ion and light impurity transport , and are not included in the present analysis .",
    "the simulations have been performed in the good confinement region at the radius of @xmath0 .",
    "two time instances are investigated , one at the startup of the discharge during the transient ramp up phase ( @xmath1 ) characterized by @xmath2 due to the high lithium concentration ( @xmath3 ) , and one in the density plateau phase at @xmath4 with @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",

    "increasing collisionality with respect to the reference value ( dashed , crosses ) weakly stabilizes itg modes and destabilizes trapped electron modes .",
    "the latter observation was unexpected since tem - s are typically stabilized by increasing collisionality even with pitch - angle scattering only .",
    "a similar behaviour is also observed at 1% lithium concentration ( not shown ) .",
    "a collisionality scaling of linear growth rates exhibiting a maximum has been reported in @xcite , but there the increasing part of the @xmath18 function corresponds to significantly higher density gradients than those in the present simulation . when using the full collision operator ( cyan diamonds ) , it changes the itg / tem spectrum to an itg only case via stabilization of the te modes . if the collision frequency is increased to @xmath16 ( dashed , diamonds ) , a uniform stabilizing effect across the whole spectrum is observed .",
    "if the collision frequency is further increased to the value of the @xmath19 case ( @xmath20 ) the modes are completely stabilized ( not shown ) . when the impurity concentration is reduced to @xmath5 while keeping the full collision operator ( green dots )",
    ", the reference collision frequency slightly changes through the weak density dependence of the coulomb - logarithm ( the change is less than 2% ) .",
    "however , the frequency of the collisions with the two ion species is strongly affected : @xmath21 increases while @xmath22 decreases due to the higher deuterium and lower impurity densities .",
    "the effective collision frequency of the species is proportional to the @xmath23 of the plasma .",
    "the reduced @xmath23 means that stabilization through collisions becomes weaker , the deuterium population less diluted , and the screening of the potential fluctuations less effective @xcite .",
    "these effects together cause the main ion itg modes to grow more unstable , the impurity itg driven tail to disappear and the electron driven modes to become dominant above @xmath17 ( as observed in @xcite with lorentz collision operator ) .",
    "the corresponding quasi - linear deuterium and impurity flux spectra are shown on the bottom left and right panels of figure [ fig : gk_lin_t0.3_nu ] , respectively .",
    "the flux is calculated as @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the density and velocity fluctuations , and the angled brackets denote flux surface averaging . in linear simulations the potential is normalized with the mode amplitude squared at every timestep ( included in the unit of the quasi - linear fluxes ) , and therefore the fluxes do not carry any information about their saturated values .",
    "the fluxes are proportional to the phase difference between the density and potential fluctuations during the linear phase of the mode evolution , and their signs indicate whether the flux is radially inward ( negative ) or outward ( positive ) . in the present case ,",
    "the itg modes are found to drive an inward deuterium and outward lithium flux at the reference impurity concentration @xmath27 , both with pitch - angle scattering and the full collision operator , at both collision frequencies .",
    "the direction of the particle transport remains the same even if the collision frequency is reduced to about one third of the reference value to @xmath28 ( not shown ) .",
    "however , at the reduced impurity concentration of @xmath5 the modes below @xmath29 drive the deuterium ions outward .",
    "these modes are expected to provide the majority of the particle transport according to mixing length estimates and , consequently , to reverse the direction of the deuterium flux .",
    "this result is only obtained when the energy scattering and friction terms are taken into account in the collision operator and therefore it was missed in @xcite .",
    "although the impact of these terms on the linear fluxes are typically much smaller than that of the pitch - angle scattering operator , in this case it is enough to change the sign of the fluxes that are close to zero .",

    "inward deuterium transport requires approximately @xmath33 in this case .",
    "the outward impurity flux driven by the itg modes ( middle ) remains unchanged .",
    "as the impurity concentration is increased the outward electron flux driven by the low - k modes ( right ) is also reduced .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that the electrons are less sensitive to the ion scale modes , and tend to remain nearly adiabatic in itg turbulence .",
    "when the impurity population is low the electrons must follow the ion transport due to quasi - neutrality",
    ". however , when the quasi - neutrality equation contains three major constituents , the restriction imposed by ambi - polarity can be satisfied with the two ion species . the dashed ( green ) curve on the left and right panels show a pure plasma simulation with zero impurity concentration , but with @xmath23 manually set to its original value of 1.93 .",
    "this provides approximately the same effective electron and ion collision frequencies as in the experimental case ( within 2% difference due to the change of the coulomb logarithm ) .",
    "the growth rates , frequencies and fluxes are nearly identical to the 1% impurity concentration results , showing that the main impact of the lithium is not through collisional effects .    .,title=\"fig : \" ] .,title=\"fig : \" ] .,title=\"fig : \" ]    it has been pointed out by several authors ( e.g. @xcite ) that impurity transport is sensitive to the ion density gradient . in the previous simulations",
    "the same positive density gradient value has been used for all three species , that is a centrally peaked impurity density profile has been assumed .",
    "however , experimentally the impurity profile is often found to be peaked towards the edge .",
    "the effect of varying the lithium density gradient on the quasi - linear ion flux at three different impurity concentrations is investigated in figure [ fig : gk_lin_t0.3_rlnli_nli_scan ] .",
    "since the flux reversal has been previously observed at low - k modes ( typically below @xmath31 ) , and these are the modes that provide the largest contribution to the saturated flux , the @xmath34 mode has been selected for this analysis . since the electrons are expected to be close to adiabatic in a highly contaminated plasma , the direction of the deuterium and lithium transport is determined by the balance of the drive of their respective fluxes .",
    "this drive strongly depends on the concentration and the density gradient of the impurity species , while the impact of these parameters on the low - k itg mode stability is relatively weak . if the impurity concentration is sufficiently high and its density profile sufficiently peaked , such as it is assumed during the density ramp - up of this ftu - lll discharge , then the outward drive of the impurity flux outweighs that of the deuterium , and forces the main ions to be transported inward .",
    "this observation is qualitatively consistent with the results of @xcite obtained with helium impurities .     and",
    "@xmath35.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and @xmath35.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the significance of the impurities being lithium ions is tested by a series of simulations using different light impurity species ( carbon , tritium , helium ) while keeping the deuterium concentration constant .",
    "a mixed deuterium - tritium - lithium case is also investigated due to its potential relevance in future burning plasma applications .",
    "the results are plotted in figure [ fig : gk_lin_t0.3_impurity_scan ] .",
    "the carbon ( black circles ) and lithium ( cyan diamonds ) are the most effective among the selected impurity ions in reducing the quasi - linear electron flux and driving the deuterium flux inward . however , under the current circumstances , the increase of the ion collisionality due to 7% carbon concentration strongly stabilizes the modes . the helium impurity ( blue squares ) and the mixed d - t - li case exhibit similar behaviour , but the results with 46% tritium ( light green triangles ) are close to the clear plasma simulations ( 1% lithium , green dots ) , both of them driving an outward deuterium flux .",
    "if the deuterium and impurity larmor - radii are too close , they are expected to react similarly to the main ion itg modes , and thus to be unable to reduce the electron transport and generate the deuterium pinch .",
    "indeed , the quasi - linear tritium flux in both the d - t and d - t - li cases follow that of the deuterium , although in the former case the flux is close to zero and only the three lowest k modes indicate an outward transport .",
    "the dynamics of the deuterium and lithium ions are sufficiently different for the ion flow separation to occur .",
    "however , the typical d - itg length scale is still sufficiently close to the lithium larmor - radius that the lithium ions can have a significant effect on the low - k itg transport .",

    "it is characterized by finite radial particle transport that , as it has been shown above , contributes to the dynamical build - up of the deuterium density profile and the reduction of impurity concentration . at @xmath4",
    "the plasma is described by significantly larger deuterium and electron density and density gradients , reduced @xmath23 , and a slightly increased magnetic shear .",
    "the reduced temperature is likely to be caused by the inward flux of cold deuterium ions from the edge .",
    "the reference collision frequency is approximately a factor of eight higher ( @xmath20 ) due to the lower temperature and higher density values , leading to an increased effective collision frequency of the species despite the lower @xmath23 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that increasing only the density gradient of the species from their values at @xmath30 to that at @xmath19 would be sufficient to obtain an outward flux of all three plasma constituents , as observed during the density plateau phase . however , at larger density gradients the so called ion mixing modes @xcite ( characterized by monotonously increasing mode frequency starting at negative values at low @xmath38 ) become dominant across the whole spectrum , which is in contrast with the @xmath19 simulations . the microstability and particle transport properties of the @xmath19 case can be further approached by sequentially increasing the reference collision frequency to @xmath39 , decreasing the lithium concentration to @xmath40 and electron temperature to @xmath41 , as shown on figure [ fig : gk_lin_t0.3_to_t0.8 ] .",
    "the graphs indicate that the high collisionality is essential in stabilizing the ion mixing modes but it is not , on its own , sufficient to obtain the mode structure and fluxes as observed at the later time stage . only by reducing the lithium concentration ( and thus decreasing the effective collisionality )",

    "the stabilization of the d - itg and destabilization of the ion drift modes is attributed to the significantly increased effective collisionality .",

    "our aim is to investigate the main drive of the lithium and deuterium transport when both of the ion species are centrally peaked .",
    "although it has been shown that the electron transport can not be accurately modelled by quasi - linear estimates in this case , for the sake of completeness the electron flux values are also indicated . however , the focus of the fluid analysis is on the ion transport .",

    "nonetheless , these terms provide useful additional information about the main driving mechanisms of particle transport . in the present description the term proportional to the magnetic shear , explicitly appearing in equation 2 in @xcite ,",

    "the reason for the inward deuterium transport in this case is that the strong outward slab diffusive term is compensated by the the inward curvature pinch in the @xmath111 range , as seen on the bottom left panel of the figure .",
    "the apparent cancellation between the diffusive and thermo - diffusive curvature terms is a coincidence , taking place only at the present gradient values .",
    "the outward lithium transport is dominated by the slab diffusive contribution across the spectrum .    although a precise quantitative agreement between the fluid and gyrokinetic results is not expected , the ratio of the deuterium and lithium flux in the linear gyrokinetic , non - linear gyrokinetic and quasi - linear fluid calculations at @xmath112 are all between minus one half and minus one - third .",

    "in this work a gyrokinetic and fluid analysis of the turbulent particle transport in the ftu - lll discharge # 30582 has been presented .",
    "both models show that a high concentration , centrally peaked lithium density profile during the density ramp - up phase contributes to increased electron and deuterium density peaking .",
    "the presence of lithium allows the electron response to remain nearly adiabatic at the main ion scale modes , and thus to strongly reduce the electron transport . at the estimated lithium density gradient and concentration a dominant diffusive outward drive of the impurity flux outweighs that of the deuterium , forcing the main ions to be transported inward",
    "this is achieved by the reduction of the diffusive part of the deuterium flux in presence of lithium , allowing the thermo - diffusive and pinch terms to generate a total inward flux driven by the low - k itg modes .",
    "the described mechanism driving inward deuterium transport during the ramp - up phase of the discharge is not a collisional effect , it has been observed also at reduced collisionality simulations .",
    "however , the outward drive of the impurities is reinforced by strong collisionality .",
    "this indicates that light impurity seeding during the startup of a discharge might lead to improved ion density peaking also in higher temperature experiments .",
    "the choice of lithium to achieve deuterium peaking is ideal in the sense that it is light enough to have a significant effect on the low - k itg mode transport , and that it does not cause severe performance deterioration due to radiative losses . on the other hand ,",
    "it is heavy enough that its density response sufficiently differs from that of deuterium allowing ion flow separation and leading to electron transport reduction .    the larger gradient values , as observed following the build - up of the deuterium and electron profiles , provide stronger drive for both itg and te modes , and lead to a regime dominated by ion mixing modes . increasing the gradients",
    "is therefore not sufficient to obtain the mode structure present in the density plateau phase of the discharge .",
