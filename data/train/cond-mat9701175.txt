    "magnetic films and multilayers have been a subject of intense study since they provide experimental realizations for various two - dimensional ( 2d ) magnetic models.@xcite most of the recent literature has focused on _ metallic _ magnetic structures .",
    "however , _ insulating _",
    "antiferromagnetic structures provide an opportunity to study magnetic long - range order in 2d layered systems of _ localized _ spins . among those , the eute / pbte superlattice ( sl ) structures are of special interest since only one of the two components , eute , is magnetic .",
    "bulk eute is a type - ii antiferromagnet of the family of europium chalcogenides , with the structure of nacl .",
    "its magnetic moments arise from the strongly localized @xmath0 electrons of the eu@xmath1 atoms which are in a symmetric @xmath2 ground state .",
    "thus , the europium chalcogenides have long been considered ideal realizations of isotropic heisenberg models.@xcite antiferromagnetic resonance experiments have confirmed that , once dipolar interactions are taken into account , the residual anisotropy in eute is negligible.@xcite bulk eute has a nel temperature ( @xmath3 ) of 9.8 k. below @xmath3 , spins belonging to a single ( 111 ) plane are parallel but antiparallel to spins in adjacent ( 111 ) planes .",
    "the magnetic properties of eute are described by a heisenberg hamiltonian with two exchange constants : @xmath4 ( nearest neighbors , ferromagnetic ) and @xmath5 ( next - nearest neighbors , antiferromagnetic ) : @xmath6 the @xmath7 vectors denote eu@xmath1 spins , which have magnitude 7/2 .",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath5 are not known very precisely ; currently accepted values are : @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the boltzmann constant.@xcite    although the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) has full rotational symmetry , neutron diffraction experiments show that the spins lie in ( 111 ) planes.@xcite this easy - plane anisotropy is properly accounted for by adding dipole - dipole interactions to the exchange hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ e1]).@xcite    in this article we present experimental and theoretical studies of the susceptibilities of short - period eute / pbte sl s .",
    "we use the notation eute(@xmath11)/pbte(@xmath12 ) to denote a sl structure whose period consists of @xmath11 monolayers of eute and @xmath12 monolayers of pbte . each sample used in the present work consisted of 400 such periods and",
    "was prepared so that @xmath13 .",
    "since samples are grown in the ( 111 ) direction , the structure within the eute monolayers is that of a triangular lattice and the monolayers are stacked according to the abc sequence .",
    "section ii describes our samples and presents results for their temperature - dependent zero - field susceptibilities .",
    "section iii presents a discussion of the experimental results , then section iv presents a mean - field determination of the order parameter , a monte - carlo simulation of the susceptibilities of an eute(3)/pbte(9 ) sample , and a calculation of the out - of - plane susceptibility at low temperature .",
    "section v summarizes our findings .",
    "experiments were conducted on sl samples of eute(@xmath11)/pbte(@xmath14 ) for @xmath15 . in each sample",
    "the sl stack was grown on a 3000    pbte ( 111 ) oriented buffer layer , itself grown on a baf@xmath16 ( 111 ) substrate . a 500    pbte cap layer was used to prevent oxidation of the highly reactive eute .",
    "details of the mbe growth process have been published elsewhere.@xcite the sl s have approximately square wave composition modulation , as reflected by the multiple narrow sl peaks of the high - resolution x - ray diffraction data.@xcite electron spin resonance ( esr ) experiments show very little interdiffusion at the eute - pbte interface.@xcite furthermore , careful _ in situ _ scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) investigations have shown that the pbte and eute heterointerfaces are quite smooth on a length scale of at least 200  , with imperfections strictly limited to single monolayer steps.@xcite the _ ex situ _ cross - sectional tem images also exhibit smooth pbte and eute interfaces.@xcite    the magnetic properties of the sl s used have been studied previously by squid magnetometry,@xcite and elastic neutron scattering.@xcite magnetic hysteresis curves and neutron diffraction spectra taken at 1.8k and 4.2k show that for all samples with @xmath17 a transition to a low - temperature ordered phase takes place at @xmath18 4.2k , the order being that of a type ii antiferromagnet , i.e. identical to that of bulk eute .",
    "since the mbe samples are grown along the ( 111 ) direction , this implies that the spins in each eute monolayer order ferromagnetically and are antiparallel to those in neighboring monolayers .",
    "moreover , the spins lie within the eute monolayers .",
    "static magnetization measurements taken parallel to the sl plane show no detectable in - plane anisotropy.@xcite      our susceptiblility measurements used a quantum design ( mpms5 ) ac susceptometer .",
    "susceptibilities were measured in two geometries : @xmath19 was measured with the ac probing field @xmath20 parallel to the sl plane , @xmath21 was measured with @xmath20 orthogonal to the sl plane ( see fig . [ f01 ] ) .    for each sample , @xmath19 and @xmath21",
    "have been measured as a function of temperature from 15 k in the paramagnetic region to below the transition temperature , in a nominal zero external static magnetic field ( i.e. , less than 2 gauss ) with a 20 hz ac probing field of 4 gauss . since the probing field is small , diamagnetic contributions from the baf@xmath16 substrate and the pbte buffer layer can safely be ignored .",
    "a study of the dependence of the susceptibility on @xmath20 and on the ac frequency indicates that our measurements are always in the linear regime of the static susceptibility .",
    "figure [ totalgraph ] displays the temperature dependence of the in - plane and ou - of - plane magnetic susceptibilities @xmath19 and @xmath21 for samples eute(2)/pbte(6 ) through eute(7)/pbte(21 ) .",
    "the experimental susceptibilities have been normalized by the number of eu@xmath1 spins , determined using high temperature susceptibility data ; no demagnetizing corrections have been applied to the data . in the following",
    "we will be mostly interested in @xmath21 , whose magnitude changes little below the temperature at which @xmath21 and @xmath19 separate .",
    "since there is no observable difference in @xmath21 and @xmath19 above this temperature we can assume that demagnetizing corrections are not significant .",
    "for all samples with @xmath22 a plot of @xmath23 versus @xmath24 showed that , as the temperature is lowered , the curie behavior of @xmath19 and @xmath21 persists until they separate at a temperature @xmath25.@xcite fig .",
    "[ chit2 ] shows such a plot for sample eute(3)pbte(9 ) .",
    "generically , below the point of separation a very anisotropic behavior of the susceptibility is observed , with @xmath26 , an unusual feature .",
    "furthermore , while @xmath19 displays a peak , @xmath21 has a very mild temperature dependence below @xmath25 .",
    "in addition , the magnitude of @xmath21 at low temperature , of the order of @xmath27 emu / spin , has little dependence on the thickness of the eute layer .",
    "since we do not have other experimental data ( e.g. specific heat ) that would allow us to define more precisely the transition temperature @xmath3 , we assumed that it lies in between @xmath25 and the temperature at which @xmath19 is maximum .",
    "@xmath3 increases with the thickness of the eute layer , as expected , and reaches values higher than that for bulk eute for samples with @xmath28 , an unexpected result .",
    "a possible explanation could be that coupling constants have values different from the bulk ones , a point developed further in section [ discuss ] .",
    "we comment now on samples that show non - generic behavior .",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath21 as well as @xmath29 and @xmath30 have been measured for @xmath31k .",
    "they are plotted in fig .",
    "[ sample13 ] .",
    "one sees that in this temperature regime sample eute(1)/pbte(3 ) remains in a paramagnetic phase : @xmath19 and @xmath21 coincide and exhibit a curie behavior .",
    "the absence of a transition in this temperature range can be understood by noting that in a monolayer geometry the @xmath5 exchange coupling is not present and the energy scale is set by the nearest - neighbor exchange coupling only , which is very small .",
    "we expect however a transition at a lower temperature .",
    "elastic neutron scattering spectra show no long - range order at 4.2k but they do show a peak corresponding to type ii antiferromagnetic ordering at 1.8k . thus the broad maximum in @xmath19 does not signal a transition from the paramagnetic to the antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "the sharp drop in @xmath21 around 5k is reproducible .",
    "however we only had one eute(6)/pbte(18 ) sample .",
    "eute(6)/pbte(18 ) is the only sample in our series that displays this feature , as yet unexplained .",
    "a qualitatively different behavior for @xmath19 is expected _ a priori _ , depending on whether the number of eute monolayers per sl period is odd or even . in the first case",
    ", each period should behave as a ferromagnet and there should be a peak in @xmath19 whereas in the latter case each period should behave as an antiferromagnet and we should see a smooth maximum .",
    "although we use integers @xmath32 and @xmath12 to label our samples , the average thickness of , say , the eute layer in an actual sl period as determined by x - ray scattering is fractional because of the interface structure so that the odd / even effect is in fact expected to be blurred.@xcite    in our view , the main issues raised by our data is the existence of a phase transition in samples with @xmath17 at temperatures comparable to the bulk t@xmath33 . as mentioned above , neutron diffraction spectra unambiguously demonstrate that these samples have a low - temperature ordered phase . also , anisotropy in the hamiltonian for eu@xmath1 spins is negligible , so that our samples can be considered as representing a model 2d heisenberg system . in such a system , with isotropic exchange couplings ,",
    "the transition should occur at t=0k.@xcite the hamiltonian is however incomplete and we need to supplement the exchange couplings with dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "although the dipole - dipole coupling may be weak , it breaks the rotational symmetry and is long - range , which prevents application of the mermin - wagner theorem.@xcite dipolar couplings are known to have large effects in metallic thin films , in which they compete with uniaxial anisotropy.@xcite    early work @xcite has demonstrated the possibility of a phase transition driven by dipolar interactions in a 2d isotropic spin system .",
    "more recent work has investigated the dependence of @xmath3 on the magnitude of the dipolar coupling.@xcite .",
    "it is our hypothesis that dipolar interactions are responsible for stabilizing magnetic long - range order in eute / pbte sl s . in the next section",
    "we discuss some implications of this hypothesis .",
    "the observation that @xmath26 for all samples can be understood by noting that there are actually three pertinent susceptibilities in our system : @xmath34 , along the direction of the order parameter in the sl plane , @xmath35 , in the sl plane , but orthogonal to the direction of the order parameter , and @xmath21 , orthogonal to the sl plane . in our case",
    ", @xmath35 and @xmath21 will be different because of dipolar interactions , and @xmath21 will be smaller than @xmath35 .",
    "usually one has @xmath36 , and in our case we expect @xmath37 . the assumption that in each atomic layer the spins belong to domains with random orientations yields : @xmath38 .",
    "it is thus possible for @xmath21 to be smaller than @xmath19 .",
    "in this section , we use the following hamiltonian to describe the interaction of eu@xmath1 spins :    @xmath39    where the third sum runs over all sites @xmath40 and @xmath41 in the sl and on spin components @xmath42 , @xmath43 . here",
    "@xmath44 is the dipolar tensor which reads : @xmath45 in this expression , @xmath46 is the bohr magneton and @xmath47 is the land @xmath47 factor which we will take equal to 2 . throughout this section",
    "we will approximate the spins @xmath7 by _ classical _ vectors .",
    "this is justified by the large magnitude @xmath48 of the eu@xmath1 spins and the fact that we do nt expect quantum effects in the temperature range we will be considering .",
    "the structure within the eute layers is that of a triangular lattice and the layers are stacked according to the abc sequence .",
    "we will take the @xmath49 and @xmath50 axes in the plane of the layer and the @xmath51 axis orthogonal to the layer plane .",
    "let us denote by @xmath52 and @xmath53 the dipolar energies per spin of an eute monolayer , assuming the spins are ferromagnetically aligned either in the layer plane or orthogonal to the layer plane .",
    "@xmath53 is given by :    @xmath54    where the sums run on the sites of a single layer .",
    "@xmath52 is given by :    @xmath55    where we have used the fact that @xmath56 is traceless and rotationally invariant in the @xmath57 plane .",
    "notice that @xmath58 , which favors in - plane alignment , as observed in neutron diffraction experiments . using the value of @xmath59 for a triangular lattice and the value of the in - plane lattice parameter @xmath60   taken from x - ray data , we get @xmath61k and @xmath62k , to be compared with the exchange energies @xmath63k , @xmath64k and the average exchange energy per spin @xmath65k , which we have estimated using bulk eute values for @xmath4,@xmath5 .",
    "next we estimate the size of the interlayer dipolar energies . to this end",
    "we have used ewald summation techniques that allow one to rewrite @xmath66 sums as fast - converging series.@xcite let us consider two neighboring eute monolayers ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) a distance @xmath20 apart .",
    "let @xmath67 be the vector joining a lattice site in layer ( 1 ) to a lattice site in layer ( 2 ) .",
    "assuming that the spins in layer ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are all ferromagnetically aligned but with opposite directions depending on which layer they belong to , the interaction energy of a spin in layer ( 1 ) with all spins in layer ( 2 ) is : @xmath68 where the sum runs over all reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath69 , and @xmath70 and @xmath71 are , respectively , the modulus and the @xmath49-component of @xmath69 and @xmath72 is the area of the triangular lattice unit cell in the layer .",
    "we thus get : @xmath73 this energy is much smaller than the intralayer energy @xmath52 .",
    "if the spin density in the layer were uniform , no field would be created outside the layer and this energy would be 0 .",
    "the very existence of a lattice structure within the layer makes it finite .",
    "furthermore , the interaction energy is expected to decay fast as the distance from the layer becomes larger than the in - plane lattice constant .",
    "for instance , at a distance two layers away , this energy is @xmath74k , and three layers away it is @xmath75k .    as a result",
    ", we can safely discard all interlayer couplings as well as interperiod couplings , which couple spins belonging to different sl periods .",
    "although small , the intralayer coupling has to be retained for the reasons mentioned in section [ discussion ] .",
    "we now turn to a mean field treatment of our problem .",
    "our aim here is to identify the order parameter for the phase transition rather than find the expression for @xmath3 .. we consider a single period of a sl which consists of @xmath76 eute monolayers .",
    "the spins are labelled with two indices : @xmath40 denotes their position in a layer , @xmath77 the layer to which they belong .",
    "we rewrite the hamiltonian as : @xmath78 where the matrix @xmath79 is defined by : @xmath80 in which j denotes the matrix of the exchange couplings and its elements are equal to @xmath4 if ( @xmath81 ) and ( @xmath82 ) are nearest neighbors , to @xmath5 if they are next - nearest neighbors , and to zero otherwise .",
    "the @xmath83 factor expresses the fact that interlayer dipolar couplings are neglected .    a mean - field calculation in our context amounts to diagonalizing @xmath79 and finding its lowest eigenvalue .",
    "the magnitude of the latter determines @xmath3 while the associated eigenvector defines the order parameter for the transition .",
    "@xcite    since @xmath56 is diagonal in the layer indices we concentrate first on @xmath84 .",
    "we define in - plane fourier transforms @xmath85 for the spins through : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the number of spins per layer .",
    "likewise we define @xmath88 as : @xmath89 since we expect the ordered phase to be homogeneous in the plane of the layers , we now restrict ourselves to the @xmath90 sector of the hamiltonian .",

    "now @xmath96 can be diagonalized in the basis of @xmath76-dimensional orthonormal vectors @xmath97 , whose components are : @xmath98 where @xmath99 is an integer ranging from 1 to @xmath76 .",

    "note that , as @xmath110 the usual antiferromagnetic staggered magnetization is recovered .",
    "we will in the next section check that @xmath111 is indeed the correct order parameter .",
    "we have performed a monte carlo simulation for our system in order to check that dipolar interactions can drive a transition at a temperature @xmath112 and can generate an anisotropy in the susceptibility similar to that observed in experiments .",

    "we present here results of a monte carlo simulation carried out on a system of 3 layers , each consisting of 23@xmath11323 spins , with periodic boundary conditions in the plane of the layers , in order not to introduce in - plane anisotropy .",
    "each layer is thus mapped to a torus .",
    "the full hamiltonian ( [ fullham ] ) has been used , where the distance @xmath114 between pairs of sites has been taken to be the smallest distance on the torus between sites @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",

    "error bars have been carefully computed as standard deviations of estimators of the observables .",
    "three susceptibilities have been evaluated : @xmath117 , along the normal to the layers , corresponding to @xmath21 , and @xmath118 and @xmath119 in the plane of the layers .",
    "the specific heat has also been measured to check that it has a limit of @xmath10 per spin as @xmath120 , a general property of classical spin systems.@xcite it is shown in fig .",

    ". this can not be the case , as the value of the dipolar coupling only depends on the in - plane lattice parameter , known from x - ray spectra .",
    "one possible explanation is that the exchange constants are different in the sl s relative to bulk values .",
    "because of a 2.1% lattice mismatch between eute and pbte , the sl will be strained and the in - plane and out - of - plane lattice constants will be different from one another , and different from their bulk values @xcite . as a result , the exchange couplings will also be somewhat different . within the family of eu",
    "chalcogenides the lattice constant increases as the size of the anion increases from o to te which makes it possible to study the dependence of the exchange couplings on the lattice parameter.@xcite in our case the in - plane lattice constant is reduced with respect to the bulk value while the out - of - plane constant is increased .",
    "thus , in the sl s , the in - plane @xmath4 is likely to increase , while the out - of - plane @xmath4 will decrease .",
    "although dipolar interactions account for the flatness of @xmath21 at low temperature , we can expect a single - ion anisotropy term of the form @xmath211 to have the same effect .",
    "let us replace @xmath171 with such a term .",
    "the calculation of @xmath21 is similar , except that in equation ( [ dipolezpart ] ) , @xmath212 is replaced by @xmath213 .",
    "thus for single - ion anisotropy to have the same effect as dipole interactions , @xmath213 would have to be of the order of @xmath214k , which is larger than the exchange couplings , an unlikely situation .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have presented experimental susceptibilities of eute / pbte short - period antiferromagnetic superlattices .",
    "we suggest that dipolar interactions may stabilize long - range order in these 2d structures .",
    "additional theoretical work along with more precise susceptibility data and specific heat measurements are needed to confirm this hypothesis and to study the critical behavior , an aspect not touched upon in the present work .",
