    "the omputation of gravitational radiation from the inspiral and merger of binary black holes poses a difficult boundary value problem . in the geometrically simplest and physically most natural treatment ,",
    "the black holes are modeled by the gravitational collapse of a pair of stars ( or other astrophysical bodies ) .",
    "however , this is a challenging hydrodynamic problem which requires simulating a pair of orbiting bodies for a sufficient time to verify a negligible amount of incoming radiation in the initial conditions , then following their subsequent collapse to black holes and finally computing the outgoing radiation in the exterior spacetime .",
    "alternatively , in the purely vacuum approach , the individual black holes form from imploding gravitational waves .",
    "this avoids hydrodynamical difficulties at the expense of a globally complicated initial value problem .",
    "the imploding waves may emanate either ( i ) from a past singularity or ( ii ) from past null infinity @xmath0 . in case ( i ) , the appropriate boundary condition at @xmath0 is that there be no ingoing radiation but , assuming the time reversed version of cosmic censorship , the past singularity implies a white hole horizon @xmath1 on which boundary data must be specified in some arbitrary manner in order to determine the exterior spacetime . in case ( ii ) , ingoing radiation from @xmath0 is present at early times when the black holes are formed but ingoing radiation must be absent at late times in order for the outgoing radiation to be unambiguously attributed to the merging black holes . in this work",
    ", we present a solution to the first stage of a new two - stage global treatment of the vacuum binary black hole problem  @xcite .",
    "the approach , based upon characteristic evolution , has been carried out in the regime of schwarzschild perturbations where advanced and retarded solutions of the linearized problem can be rigorously identified  @xcite .",
    "computational experiments are necessary to study the applicability of the approach to the nonlinear regime .    from a time - reversed viewpoint ,",
    "this first stage is equivalent to the determination of the outgoing radiation emitted from the fission of a white hole in the absence of ingoing radiation .",
    "this provides the physically correct `` retarded '' waveform for a white hole fission , were such events to occur in the universe .",
    "although there is no standard astrophysical mechanism for producing white holes from a nonsingular matter distribution , white holes of primordial or quantum gravitational origin can not be ruled out .",
    "this fission problem has a simpler formulation as a characteristic initial value problem than the black hole merger problem .",
    "the boundary of the ( conformally compactified ) exterior spacetime contains two null hypersurfaces where boundary conditions must be satisfied : past null infinity @xmath0 , where the incoming radiation must vanish , and the white hole event horizon @xmath2 , which must describe a white hole , which is initially in equilibrium with no ingoing radiation and then distorts and ultimately fissions into two white holes with the emission of outgoing gravitational waves .",
    "if we approximate @xmath0 by an outgoing null hypersurface @xmath3 , which intersects @xmath1 at an early time ( approximating past time infinity @xmath4 ) close to the initial equilibrium of the white hole , then data on these two null hypersurfaces , @xmath1 and @xmath3 , constitute a standard double - null initial value problem , whose evolution determines a portion of the exterior spacetime extending to @xmath5 , where the outgoing radiation is computed .",
    "in contrast , the corresponding problem for the `` retarded '' waveform from a black hole merger involves two disjoint null hypersurfaces where boundary conditions must be satisfied : past null infinity @xmath0 , where the incoming radiation must vanish , and the future event horizon @xmath6 , which describes the merger of the two black holes and their subsequent approach to equilibrium .    in previous work  @xcite",
    ", we treated the fission problem in the close approximation  @xcite as a perturbation of a schwarzschild background . in this paper",
    "we present a fully nonlinear treatment that reveals new and interesting strong field behavior .",
    "we carry out the evolution of this vacuum double - null problem by means of a characteristic evolution code  @xcite , using a recent version of the code which improves accuracy in the highly nonlinear region  @xcite .",
    "caustics in the ingoing null hypersurfaces used to foliate the exterior spacetime restrict the evolution to the pre - fission stage .",

    "is constructed to handle a general event horizon representing the fission of a spinning white hole into two outspiraling white holes of non - equal mass  @xcite .",
    "the specific application in this paper is to the axisymmetric head - on fission into equal mass white holes .",
    "( the necessary data and evolution codes are , however , _ not _ limited to the axial symmetry of a head - on collision . ) the resulting horizon geometry is an upside - down version of the standard trousers - shaped event horizon for a binary black hole merger in the time - reversed scenario .",
    "we study a range of models extending from the perturbative close limit , in which the fission occurs in the infinite future , to the highly nonlinear regime .",
    "nontrivial global changes , accompanied by dramatic time dependence of the horizon geometry , arise in passing from the perturbative to the highly nonlinear regime  @xcite .",
    "the existence of a marginally trapped surface divides the horizon into interior and exterior regions , analogous to the division of the schwarzschild horizon by the @xmath7 bifurcation sphere . in passing from the perturbative to the strongly nonlinear regime",
    "there is a transition in which the fission occurs in the portion of the horizon visible from @xmath8 .",
    "thus these results reveal two classes of binary white hole spacetimes , depending upon whether the crotch in the trousers ( where the fission occurs ) is bare , in the sense that it is visible from @xmath5 , or hidden inside a marginally trapped surface . in this paper",

    "we plot the real part of the bondi news at a point on the equator , as a function of bondi time @xmath188 . due to axisymmetry ,",
    "the imaginary part of the bondi news is zero to within discretization error .",
    "the sharp pulse clearly visible in the news at @xmath189 results from the choice of parameters in the white hole horizon data which control the rapidity of the fission . here",
    ", in order that the model yield a bare fission , the parameters have been chosen so that the fission occurs on an extremely rapid time scale .",
    "subsequent to this sharp pulse , the news undergoes a damped oscillation ( which is too early in the final ringdown to be associated with a quadrupole quasinormal mode ) .",
    "the bondi news as computed by the full code osculates the results obtained in the perturbative limit  @xcite , in the regime in which the perturbative and nonlinear codes are clearly solving the same problem ( up to @xmath190 ) . at later times ( @xmath191 )",
    ", the fully nonlinear news calculation deviates from the perturbative results as a consequence of the appearance of higher harmonics",
    ". these higher harmonics , which are clearly visible in the news as a function on the sphere , arise from the nonlinearity of the equations and can not be observed in a perturbative evolution .",
    "figures  [ fig : quad ] and [ fig : dimple ] illustrate the angular behavior of the news at early time ( @xmath192 ) and at late time ( @xmath193 ) , respectively .",
    "we plot the real part of the bondi news on a single stereographic patch for the case @xmath194 .",
    "the graphs clearly show that at early times the news is pure quadrupole , in agreement with the perturbative regime of the close approximation .",
    "the nonlinearity of the problem subsequently introduces higher harmonics in the news .",
    "these higher harmonics are clearly visible at later times in the plots of the bondi news as a function on the sphere .",
    "the most notable feature is the dimple seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : dimple ] on the profile of the news at the pole ( the center of the stereographic patch ) .",
    "this feature is partially due to the retardation effect introduced by the angular - dependent redshift of the bondi frames at future null infinity @xmath5 .",
    "we have chosen the initial cut of @xmath5 , corresponding to a constant affine time @xmath24 on the horizon , to be a cut of constant bondi time .",

    "figure  [ fig : bondi ] , which displays the angular dependence of bondi time @xmath188 for a fixed horizon time @xmath24 , reveals a pronounced increase in bondi time at the pole relative to the equator .",
    "we have computed a family of spacetimes exterior to a head - on white hole fission ranging from the close approximation to the nonlinear regime .",
    "the results reveal a dramatic time and angular dependence in the waveforms produced in the extreme nonlinear regime . at early times",
    ", the results agree with close - approximation perturbative calculations as expected . while the results presented here are for the axisymmetric non - spinning case , the data and evolution codes are not restricted to any symmetry",
    ". it will be interesting to see how the results for a head - on collision are modified in the fission of a spinning white hole .",
    "reexpressed in terms of the time - reversed scenario of a black hole merger , the boundary conditions for a fission corresponds to no _ outgoing _ radiation in the black hole case .",
    "nevertheless , the results pave the way for an application of characteristic codes to calculate the fully nonlinear waveform emitted in a binary black hole collision in the time period from merger to ringdown .",
    "waveforms from a black hole merger can be expected to differ from those from a white hole fission , as has been observed in close approximation studies  @xcite .",
    "the fission process is directly observable at @xmath5 whereas the merger waveform arises indirectly from the preceding collapse of the matter or gravitational wave energy that forms the black holes .",
    "this suggests that the fission is a more efficient source of gravitational waves and that the high fractional mass losses computed here can not be attained in a black hole merger .",
