    "the soft component in 4u  162667 , when modeled as a black - body emission requires the size of emission region to be comparable to that of the neutron star because the intrinsic luminosity of this source is of the order of 10@xmath1 erg s@xmath2 ( orlandini et al .",
    "1998 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the soft component in her  x-1 can be modeled as a black - body which is reprocessed emission from the innermost part of the accretion disk ( endo et al .",
    "however , for the bright pulsars in the magellanic clouds for which the distance is of the order of 5060 kpc and the luminosity is close to the eddington limit , the luminosity of the soft excess is about an order of magnitude larger compared to the same of her  x-1 .",

    "2000b ) needs to be probed with greater detail .    to investigate the pulse phase dependence of the soft component of accreting x - ray pulsars in detail , we have chosen two luminous x - ray pulsars smc  x-1 and lmc  x-4 , which are in the magellanic clouds and suffer less interstellar absorption .",
    "smc  x-1 and lmc  x-4 are two bright , eclipsing , accreting , binary x - ray pulsars with spin periods of @xmath00.7 and @xmath013.5 s and binary periods of @xmath03.9 and @xmath01.4 day respectively .",

    "1998 ) and stable in lmc  x-4 ( lang et al . 1981 ) .",
    "the long - period is believed to be a result of ( quasi ) periodic obscuration of the neutron star by a precessing accretion disk , similar to that in her  x-1 .",
    "broad band energy - spectra ( 0.237 kev ) of these two sources were studied by performing a combined fit to the observations made with rosat and ginga ( woo et al . 1995 ; 1996 ) .",

    "the soft component was modeled as a single black - body component ( @xmath8 = 0.16 kev ) in smc  x-1 and as a sum of a low temperature black - body emission ( @xmath8 = 0.03 kev ) and a thermal bremsstrahlung emission ( @xmath9 = 0.35 kev ) in lmc  x-4 .",
    "beppo - sax observations also showed presence of similar soft component ( la barbera et al .",

    "the soft x - rays from smc x-1 were found to be nonpulsating ( marshal et al .",

    "phase filtering was applied withtin the ftools task xselect . in this method , the photon arrival time or the center time of each data bin is used to determine which phase bin the photon belongs to . in order to search for variability of the soft component , the phase resolved spectra",
    "were fitted with the models i and ii which have a thermal component for the soft excess .",
    "a pulsating nature of the soft component has been detected in both the models with identical amplitude .",
    "here we discuss only the results obtained with the first model .",
    "at first we created four phase resolved spectra consisting the main pulse , sub pulse , and two minima of the pulse profile as shown in the bottom panel of figure 2 . while fitting these four spectra , all the spectral parameters were allowed to vary .",
    "the results of this analysis are shown in figure 4 and table 2 . while the normalisation of the power - law and black - body components are found to have considerable variation ( table 2 ) , variations of the black - body temperature and photon index are within measurement uncertainities .",
    "since we have used gis data in the energy range 0.7 - 10.0 kev , the column density values are not well constrained to see any measurable variation ( table 2 ) .",
    "we , therefore , fixed most of the spectral parameters to their phase averaged value during the later part of the phase resolved spectroscopy , when we have more phase bins and poorer statistics in each phase bin .",
    "further , 16 pulse phase resolved spectra were obtained only from the gis data .",
    "the variations of the power - law flux , black - body flux , and the total flux with the pulse phase are shown in figure 5 .",
    "it is clearly seen that the strength of the power - law component has a profile similar to the pulse profile .",
    "the black - body component shows a nearly sinusoidal intensity variation with the pulse phase . there is also phase difference between the soft and hard pulse profiles .",
    "a constant fit to the phase resolved black - body flux gives a reduced @xmath24 of 7.2 and a sinusoidal fit improves the reduced @xmath24 to 4.0 .",
    "while a sinusoidal does not represent the variation of the black - body flux very well , poorness of the first fit certainly shows a varying nature of the black - body flux .    assuming that the pulse profiles at different narrow energy bands are made of two components , one nearly sinusoidal and the other complex ( shown in the top and middle panels of figure 5 ) , we have estimated the fraction of sinusoidal and complex components in the smc  x-1 pulse profile at different energies .",
    "the narrow band pulse profiles were fitted to a composite of two templates ( made from the top and middle panels of figure 5 ) and the fractions of the two components that give minimum @xmath24 was found out . in figure 6",
    ", we compare this with the ratio of the black - body to total flux derived from the best fit spectral model . a resonable agreement between",
    "the two provides a consistency for the hypothesis that there are two spectral components with different pulse profiles .",
    "the orbital period of lmc  x-4 is known to have a decay time scale of 10@xmath5 yr . the decay rate of the binary orbit of lmc  x-4 has been established with high confidence by combining the earlier known mid - eclipse times with a recent precise measurement with the rxte ( levine et al .",
    "2000 ) . from the asca observations of lmc  x-4 ,",
    "we have determined two more mid - eclipse times . among the four orbital parameters , orbital period , semi - amplitude of the arrival time delay , eccentricity and mid - eclipse time , the later is likely to have maximum variation between observation to observation .",
    "this also allows precise measurement of the period change . a small pulse fraction and low count rate of lmc  x-4 with asca ,",
    "does not allow us to directly apply the pulse arrival time analysis .",
    "we , therefore adopted a different approach to determine the mid - eclipse time .",
    "after the barycentric corrections , the light curves were corrected for delays due to the orbital motion with the known semi - amplitude , orbital period and zero eccentricity of the system for various trial mid - eclipse times around its extrapolated value .",
    "the epoch - folding technique was applied on each of these light curves ( with time resolution of 62.5 ms ) and the maximum @xmath25 and the pulse period corresponding to each trial mid - eclipse time was determined .",
    "the distribution of maximum @xmath25 against the trial mid - eclipse times are shown in figure 7 for the two asca observations in 1994 and 1996 .",
    "the maximum @xmath25 distribution has a gaussian profile around its expected value , the center of which gives the correct mid - eclipse time .",
    "the two mid eclipse times obtained are mjd 49468.6859 @xmath22 0.0054 and mjd 50227.8069 @xmath22 0.0016 and the corresponding pulse periods are 13.5075 @xmath22 0.0002 s and 13.5088 @xmath22 0.0001 s respectively . in absence of a clear method of error determination ,",
    "we have taken the width of the gaussians as the error of the mid - eclipse time , which possibly is an overestiamtion .",
    "the mid - eclipse times determined here are consistent with the orbital evolution history of lmc  x-4 with evolution time scale of 10@xmath5 yr ( levine et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the pulse profiles obtained from the gis detectors are shown in figure 8 for two different and summed energy bands .",

    "resolved spectroscopy , orbital motion of the neutron star was corrected in the light curve using the known semi - amplitude , eccentricity ( levine et al . 2000 ) and mid - eclipse time derived from the asca data .",
    "the four spectral models used for fitting the smc  x-1 spectrum were modified slightly for the lmc  x-4 spectrum . the high energy cutoff component was removed .",
    "residuals of the best fit lmc  x-4 spectra with the four above mentioned models showed some line like features around 1 and 2 kev . therefore , while fitting the lmc  x-4 spectrum we included two gaussian components .",
    "similar to smc  x-1 , the phase averaged spectrum could be fitted well with all the four models described above and the parameter values for the best fit obtained for each model are given in table 3 .",
    "the photon index ( @xmath18 ) of the hard power - law component is identical in all the four models , @xmath00.70 .",
    "a black - body for the soft component requires a temperature of 0.17 kev and for a distance of 55 kpc of the lmc , if the black - body emission region is assumed to be spherical , it should have a radius of @xmath0300 km . in figure 9 ,",
    "the sis and gis count rate spectra are shown along with the components of model - i in the upper panel , while the residuals to the best fit model are shown in the bottom panel .",
    "a thermal bremsstrahlung emission with a temperature of 0.5 kev and emission measure of 5@xmath3 @xmath26 @xmath20 also fits the soft excess well .",
    "if the soft excess is modeled in the form of an additional power - law , it has a photon index of 2.9 , whereas an inversely broken power law type spectrum requires a soft photon index of @xmath01.9 below a break energy of 1.7 kev .",
    "compared to the broken power - law model , the two power - law model , which has a cross - over energy of 1.5 kev , gives a steeper soft power - law .",

    "( 1996 ) and la barbera et al .",
    "( 2001 ) fitted the soft excess in lmc  x-4 as thermal bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "the temperature and flux of the thermal bremsstrahlung component obtained in model ii is similar to the their measurements , which were also carried out in high state of lmc  x-4 .",
    "same is true about the flux and equivalent width of the iron emission line .",
    "la barbera et al .",
    "( 2001 ) found evidence of two distinct iron emission lines from the beppo - sax observation and the 6.1 kev line remains unexplained .",
    "however , an independent analysis of the same data ( oosterbroek et al . 2002 , private communication ) was found to favour a model consisting of a hard power - law , a black body type soft component , an emission line at 0.9 kev and a single iron emission line .",
    "the residuals of the best fitted model spectrum from the rosat and ginga data ( figure 5 of woo et al .",
    "1996 ) also show the possibility of two weak emission lines at @xmath0 1 kev and @xmath0 2 kev .",
    "similar to the case with smc  x-1 , only four parameters related to the shape and strength of the hard power - law and the soft excess were allowed to vary while all the other spectral parameters were fixed to their phase averaged value .",
    "after the barycentric and orbital motion corrections of the photon arrival times , spectra were extracted from 16 uniformly divided pulse phases .",
    "all but the photon index and normalisation of the hard power - law component and temperature and normalisation of the soft component were fixed to their best fit values obtained from the pulse averaged spectrum .",
    "modulations of flux from the hard and the soft components are shown in figure 10 along with the total flux .",
    "the phase resolved spectra show that the power - law component follows the high - energy ( @xmath28 1.5 kev ) pulse profile with three peaks and the soft component ( either black - body or bremsstrahlung ) is consistent to a single peaked sinusoidal modulation similar to the pulse profile in the soft band ( @xmath12 1.5 kev ) .",
    "for the sis0 spectra in the fast mode , background subtraction was not done , area discrimination was used to select the source photons , and hot and flickering pixels were not removed whose effect is relatively small in this mode . due to these effects ,",
    "the spectral parameters obtained from analysis of the sis0 data are inaccurate .",
    "however , the pulse phase dependence of the spectral components derived from the sis0 data are still reliable and agrees well with the results obtained from the gis data .",
    "though the pulse phase variation of the black - body flux of lmc  x-4 is consistent with a sinusoidal nature , a very low pulse fraction in this source and relatively large error bars makes it far from conclusive .",
    "since the pulse profile of lmc  x-4 in higher energy band shows several narrow features , a coarse phase bin in lmc  x-4 will not show any variation in the high energy band .",
    "we , therefore , only show the flux of the black - body component obtained from four equal phase bins in the bottom panel of figure 10 . since the statistics is poor in lmc  x-4 ,",
    "a comparison similar to what is presented in figure 6 for smc  x-1 , could not be made .",
    "the pulse phase averaged spectra of these two accretion powered bright x - ray pulsars obtained with asca clearly show the presence of a soft component , which is in excess of the hard power - law component extended to lower energies .",
    "the present work is a confirmation of the presence of soft excess in lmc  x-4 and smc  x-1 .",
    "pulse phase resolved spectroscopy , presented here , clearly show that in smc x-1 , the soft component when fitted by a black - body ( or thermal bremsstrahlung ) model , exhibits a sinusoidal pulse shape regardless of the complex , sharp profile in hard energy band .",
    "the same may also be true for lmc x-4 .",
    "a dissimilar pulse profile between the low and high energy bands is an indication that the soft component may have a different origin of emission , or at least the geometry of emission is different in different energy ranges . in lmc",
    "x-4 , la barbera et al . (",
    "2001 ) also fitted the soft excess as seed photon emission from accretion disk at magnetoshperic radius comptonized by moderately hot electrons .",
    "we have verified that this model can fit the soft excess seen in the asca spectra of both smc x-1 and lmc x-4 with electron temperature of @xmath0 1.0 kev and optical depth of 810 .",
    "if the soft photons are produced from the vicinity of the alfven radius , a modulation of the soft excess at the pulse period is difficult to explain .    among the other x - ray pulsars known to have soft excess , in which pulse phase resolved spectroscopy has also been done , rx  j0059.27138 ( kohno et al . 2000 ) and x  per ( coburn et al .",
    "2001 ) do not show any modulation in the soft component , xte  0111.27317 shows a pulse modulation of soft excess which is approximately in phase with the power - law component ( yokogawa et al .",
    "2000b ) , and her  x-1 shows a pulse modulation of soft excess which has a different phase of pulse peak compared to the power - law component ( endo et al .",

    "in addition to the soft component , there is also a broad low energy emission line with a pulse shape and phase identical with that of the black - body emission .",
    "the total amount of x - ray emission in the soft excess is @xmath30 erg s@xmath2 , which is 10% of the total emission in the asca energy band . in comparison with her",

    "smc  x-1 and lmc  x-4 are quite similar to her  x-1 .",
    "it is interesting to investigate whether the presence of the soft component and its pulsating nature can be explained in a manner similar to her  x-1 .",
    "the soft excess can be a part of the x - ray emission from regions close to the neutron star reprocessed by optically thick surrounding matter in the inner accretion disk . with an assumption that the phase averaged pulsar emission is isotropic , the reprocessing region holds a solid angle that is equal to the fraction of x - ray energy reprocessed ( @xmath05% in smc  x-1 and lmc  x-4 ) . from energy conservation , the radius at which the reprocessing region is situated ( @xmath31 ) , presumably the inner accretion disk or alfven radius ,",

    ", we make a comparison of alfven radius ( @xmath39 ) in these two pulsars with the same in her  x-1 . for a given mass and radius of the neutron star , the inner radius scales as @xmath40 . in these two pulsars",
    ", @xmath41 is larger by about one order of magnitude than that in her x-1 .",
    "the magnetic field strength ( @xmath42 ) in smc  x-1 is unknown , but the spectral cutoff energy indicate that @xmath42 is smaller than that in her  x-1 ( makishima et al .",
    "1999 ) . in lmc  x-4 , a spectral cutoff at 16 kev and a recently discovered cyclotron absorption feature at @xmath0100 kev with the beppo - sax ( la barbera et al .",
    "2001 ) are in disagreement with the correlation observed in other accretion powered x - ray pulsars .",
    "however , considering @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( corresponding to the beppo - sax measurement of the cyclotron absorption feature ) , the radius of the inner accretion disk is expected to be smaller in these two pulsars compared to her  x-1 . on the contrary , in her x-1",
    ", @xmath31 is found to be @xmath43 cm ( endo et al .",
    "2000 ) , somewhat smaller than @xmath31 estimated above for smc  x-1 and lmc  x-4 .",
    "this is one reason we suspect that a black - body type emission can not satisfactorily explain the soft excess in these two bright x - ray pulsars .    however ,",
    "absence of convincing direct measurement of the magnetic field strength in these two pulsars result in some ambiguity in the alfven radius .",
    "we also note that x - ray irradiated inner accretion disk can be highly ionised with color temperature higher than the effective temperature .",
    "presence of weak undetected emission lines may also cause the energy spectrum to deviate from a perfect blackbody , and the estimated parameters for the black - body emission region may include large systematic errors . considering the above factors",
    ", we feel that it may still be possible to interpret that the alfven radius is the emission site of the black - body type soft excess .",
    "regarding model ii for the spectrum , a large emission measure ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 @xmath20 for smc  x-1 and lmc  x-4 respectively ) required for the soft excess indicates that with a thin thermal condition ( @xmath46 ) , the emission region has to be extremely large ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 for smc  x-1 and lmc  x-4 respectively ) .",
    "since the light travel time across such a region is much larger than the pulse periods in consideration , a pulsating soft component can not be produced by such a plasma .",
    "moreover , even at extremely high densities , the cooling time scale of the plasma will be larger than the pulse periods of these pulsars . a pulsating nature of the soft component , therefore , can not be explained in the thermal bremsstrahlung model also .",
    "the two alternate models for the pulsar spectrum that we have tried here give somewhat satisfactory fit to the observed spectra .",
    "an additional soft power - law or an inversely broken shape of the power - law may also arise naturally when the entire emission is from the accretion column .",
    "the distribution of temperature and matter density in the accretion column and transparency of radiation of different energy to the magnetic field structure determines the pulse profile and the energy spectrum .",
    "the soft component probably arises from upper part of the accretion column while the hard component is from the lower part . the different pulse shape and pulse phases of the soft and hard spectral components in her x-1",
    "have been compared with the model emission from an accretion mound on the magnetic pole of a neutron star ( burnard , arons , and klein 1991 ) .",
    "different types of beaming at different energy bands and at different heights of the accretion column can give rise to the observed energy dependence of the pulse profiles . the high , near - eddington luminosity of smc  x-1 and lmc  x-4 ,",
    "most of which is in the hard power - law component can be explained in a fan beam type emission pattern , in which the x - ray emission is perpendicular to the matter flow in the accretion columns .",
    "observations of these type of bright pulsars in future , with instruments having better energy resolution and sensitivity in the lower energy band may help us to find an exact model of the pulsar spectrum .",
    "in the present work we have found that these two high luminosity pulsars show pulsations in the entire energy band of 0.510.0 kev , with strong energy dependence in the pulse shape .",
    "the pulse phase averaged energy spectra definitely show the presence of soft excess in both the sources .",
    "if the soft excess is modeled as a separate black - body or thermal bremsstrahlung type component , pulse phase resolved spectroscopy shows that the soft component has a pulsating nature in smc x-1 , which may also be true for lmc x-4 .",
    "we have found that the pulse profile of the soft component is nearly sinusoidal , significantly different from the sharp , complex profile of the hard power - law component . due to",
    "very high luminosity of these sources , the size of the emission zone required for the soft component is large ( radius @xmath0300400 km ) and we find that it is difficult to explain the pulsations detected at low energies .",
    "we have found that alternate models like inversely broken power - law or two different power - law components can also be used to describe the spectra .",
