    "random packing of spherical particles have been an important research matter mostly because it can model many complicated processes present in physics and materials engineering .",
    "some applications are found in modeling of ideal liquids  @xcite , amorphous materials  @xcite , emulsions  @xcite , glasses  @xcite , jamming  @xcite , ceramic components  @xcite and densification processes during sintering  @xcite .",
    "the understanding of the final structure of the particle aggregation is important because its physical properties may depend on the packing features such as packing density , mean coordination number , porosity and radial distribution function ( rdf ) . in particular , the study of the fine particle packing is more difficult of accomplishing when compared to the coarse particle packing once long - range interactions between particles , as van der walls and electrostatic forces , must also be taken into account in the packing formation besides the existing contact forces .",
    "in fact , depending on the electrical nature of the involved particles the van der walls forces are due to instantaneous dipole - dipole interactions ( london forces ) , permanent dipole - dipole interactions ( keesom forces ) and/or permanent dipole - induced dipole interactions ( debye forces ) .",
    "previous works  @xcite have shown that van der walls forces can form local particle clusters which hamper the particle rearrangement . moreover",
    ", they can change the packing structural characteristics depending on the particle properties .",
    "for example , the packing of micro - sized particles or smaller by means of particle deposition is found to be dominated mostly by these long - range dispersive forces  @xcite .",
    "computer simulation based on the so - called distinct element method ( dem)@xcite has been used to study fine particle packing .",
    "significant contributions in the study of these processes were given by yen and chaki  @xcite , cheng _",
    "et al _  @xcite and yang _",
    "@xcite using dem .",
    "collective rearrangement models  @xcite have also been used to simulate particle random packing .",
    "more recently , jia _ et al",
    "_  @xcite used dem to study fine particle packing with gaussian size distributions . in last decades , most efforts has been employed to study the packing of either monosized particles or particles with a well - known size distribution .",
    "however , metal or ceramic powders as well as manufacturing products may be composed by polydispersive particles that not necessarily obey a well - known size distribution .",
    "the main advantage of the usage of polydispersive particles in the industry is to allow the increase of density  @xcite and fluidity  @xcite of the formed compounds . to the best of our knowledge , packing studies concerning random size particles without an well - defined distribution",
    "have been rarely reported in the literature .",
    "the main aim of this work is to address the problem of the packing of particles with random sizes inside a closed region .",

    "]    in this paper , we performed molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations to study the two - dimensional packing process of both monosized and random size particles , that is , polydispersive particles with radii assigned at random .",
    "the system was allowed to settle under gravity towards the bottom of a @xmath2 rectangular box .",
    "the initial positions as well as the radii of five thousand non - overlapping particles were defined along the box by using a random number generator  @xcite .",
    "both the translational and the rotational movement of each particle were considered in the simulations . in order to deal with interacting fine particles",
    ", we take into account both the contact forces and the long - range dispersive forces ( van der walls and electrostatic forces ) . the contact force results from the deformation of the colliding particles and can be decomposed into two types : normal viscoelastic force and tangential friction force .",
    "we account for normal and static / sliding tangential friction forces between particles and between particle and wall by means of a linear - spring model  @xcite , while the long - range dispersive forces are computed by using a lennard - jones like potential  @xcite .",
    "the validity of this approach is based on the fact that when two microspheres of radius @xmath7 are separated by a distance @xmath8 , the effective potential ( @xmath9 ) is analogous to that one between two molecules , i.e. , falling off as @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "the packing processes are studied assuming different long - range interaction strengths .",
    "we perform statistical calculations of the different quantities studied such as packing density , mean coordination number and time derivative of the kinetic energy as the system evolves over time . for polydispersive particles ,",
    "a size spectral analysis was employed in order to obtain the rdf of the formed random close - packed structures ( rcps ) .",

    "there exist slight variations in the height of the peaks of the rdf when one considers different @xmath26 values .",

    "[ fig:09a ] and [ fig:09b ] show the packing density as a function of time for different @xmath26 values considering , respectively , soft particles ( so - called here particles with @xmath124 ) and hard particles ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "the initial packing density was about 0.563 in all cases studied . from these figures , it is clear the influence of the long - range dispersive forces during the packing process .",
    "moreover , the rcps formed by hard particles has a lower packing density than that one formed by soft particles .",
    "this happens because the hard particles suffer more elastic collisions than the soft ones , conserving a bigger amount of kinetic energy and therefore having a higher vibrating amplitude . for soft particles",
    ", we obtain an rcps density of @xmath126 ( @xmath93 ) and @xmath127 ( @xmath128 and @xmath88 ) .",
    "while for harder particles , we obtain an rcps density of @xmath129 ( @xmath93 ) and @xmath130 ( @xmath128 and @xmath88 ) .",
    "the high packing densities obtained in both cases are mainly due to smaller particles that fit the voids created between neighboring larger particles  @xcite . for a further analysis of the rcps formed by polydispersive particles , we divide these particles by size into six different spectra . the first spectrum ( @xmath131 )",
    "is a collection of particles with radii ranging from @xmath0 to @xmath132 , the second spectrum ( @xmath133 ) is a collection of particles with radii ranging from from @xmath132 to @xmath134 and so on .",

    "insets give the mean coordination number @xmath90 in all spectra that compound the rcps in the absence of long - range forces ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "note again the influence of the long - range forces during the packing process . in figs .",
    "[ fig:11a ] and [ fig:11b ] are shown the time derivative of the kinetic energy of polydispersive particles as a function of time for soft and hard particles , respectively .",
    "the relaxation time is about @xmath136 for soft particles and @xmath123 for hard particles .",
    "the time derivative of the kinetic energy is almost insensitive to long - range dispersive forces .",
    "[ fig:12]-[fig:14 ] illustrate the rdfs as defined by eq .  [ eq:13 ] for each spectrum ( spectral rdf ) as a function of the radial distance considering different @xmath26 values . for polydispersive particles , we set @xmath137 and @xmath138 . the spectral rdfs for both soft ( a ) and hard particles ( b ) are shown in these figures .",
    "insets in figs .",
    "[ fig:12]-[fig:14 ] give the frequency of particles for each spectrum in the different analyzed cases .",
    "from these figures , one can see that the general shape of the spectral rdfs is practically unchanged by the long - range interaction forces , even though they strongly influence the transient state of the packing formation process .",
    "however , it is significantly changed when one increases the hardness of the particles . for soft particles ,",
    "the first peaks of the spectral rdfs are sharper than those ones for hard particles . in other words",
    ", there exists a higher probability of finding smaller particles layer around the bigger particles when these particles are softer .",
    "this behavior is more evident when one compares the corresponding rdfs of higher spectra for soft particles with those for hard particles .",
    "md simulations are performed to study the 2d random packing process of both monosized and random size fine particles within a micrometer scale .",
    "both contact forces and long - range dispersive forces are taken into account in the simulations .",
    "different physical quantities , including the packing density , mean coordination number , kinetic energy and rdf are calculated to study the packing process dynamics and to characterize the formed rcps over different values of the long - range interaction strength and the hardness of the particles .",
    "it is found that the long - range forces can widely influence the packing process dynamics as they might form large particle clusters , depending on the value of the long - range interaction strength .",
    "however , the general shape of the rdfs for the rcps is seen to be more influenced by the hardness of the particles than by the long - range dispersive forces .",
    "moreover , we obtained a high rcps density for both monosized and polydispersive fine particles . as expected , the rcps density for polydispersive particles are found to be higher than that for monosized particles .",
    "finally , we expect that this study can be helpful in the understanding of the packing process of fine particles with random size distribution as well as motivates experimental research on this matter .",
