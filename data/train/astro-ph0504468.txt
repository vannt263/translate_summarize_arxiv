    "the phenomenon of massive protostellar disks is one of the central questions in high - mass star formation .",
    "indirect indicators for the existence of massive disks has been accumulated over recent years but unambiguous evidence for massive disks is still missing .",
    "high - spatial - resolution observations of massive molecular outflows revealed that they could be as collimated as their low - mass counterparts ( e.g. , @xcite ) indicating some underlying protostar - disk interaction as the driving mechanism .",
    "furthermore , there have been various approaches to study massive disks in a more direct way .",
    "infrared and mm continuum observations find interesting disk - candidates ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but they lack the necessary velocity information to provide kinematic proof of potential accretion disks .",
    "contrary to this , class ii ch@xmath1oh and h@xmath6o maser emission found disk - like kinematic signatures in a few cases ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but since maser emission is very selective and requires special conditions such studies do not allow a more statistical investigation of massive disk properties .",
    "the most promising approach to find and investigate disks in high - mass star formation appears to be the observation of thermal line emission which should be sensitive to the gas properties and kinematics of the disks .",
    "various investigations have been directed this way : one of the first massive disk studies were the ch@xmath1cn observations toward iras20126 + 4104 which found a velocity gradient perpendicular to the outflow @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite also used ch@xmath1cn observations to analyze potential rotating structures toward two even more massive high - mass star - forming regions , and again they found velocity gradients perpendicular to observed molecular outflows .",
    "a different approach was followed by @xcite who investigated the disks of iras20126 + 4104 and afgl5142 by the means of nh@xmath1 observations . while these approaches are promising ,",
    "there is still no unambiguous evidence for disks in high - mass star formation .",
    "even more troubling is the fact that we still do not know which is the best molecular transition to study massive disks , ch@xmath1cn seems to be a promising candidate and nh@xmath1 works in some cases as well , but we also know a number of sources where the nh@xmath1 observations apparently do not trace the disks ( zhang , priv .  comm . ) .",
    "one of the challenges of the coming years is to establish a reliable procedure to find massive disks and study their properties , which is important to constrain any theory of high - mass star formation .    with this problem in mind , we began high - spatial - resolution observations of the hmpo iras18089 - 1732 in various molecular lines with the submillimeter array ( sma ) last year @xcite .",
    "this source at a distance of @xmath7kpc with a luminosity of @xmath8l@xmath3 is part of a sample of 69 hmpos intensively studied over recent years by @xcite .",
    "the single - dish millimeter continuum observations reveal a gas mass of @xmath9m@xmath3 , and h@xmath6o and class ii ch@xmath1oh maser emission as well as a weak cm continuum source ( 0.9mjy ) has been detected at the core center .",
    "previous sma observations found an outflow in north - south direction and hcooch@xmath1 emission centered at the mm continuum peak exhibiting a velocity gradient approximately perpendicular to the outflow @xcite .",
    "the latter observations were interpreted as indicative of a possible rotating disk - like structure around the central protostar which could be influenced by the outflow as well as infall .",
    "the sio outflow emission is slightly offset from the mm continuum peak ( @xmath10 ) , allowing to speculate about a potential secondary source undetected so far .",
    "observations of a series of other molecular transitions revealed that many of them trace to some degree the outflow as well , and only a few remain confined to the core center , ch@xmath1oh being one of the latter species @xcite .",
    "however , some of the typical disk - tracers like ch@xmath1cn were not covered by the spectral setup . furthermore , the spatial resolution was marginal for our purposes ( @xmath11 corresponding to approximately 7000au at the given distance ) .",
    "therefore , we followed up on the previous observations via higher spatial resolution ( @xmath12 ) observation covering a ch@xmath1cn series as well .",
    "these observations are intended to get a better understanding of the potential massive accretion disk as well as to investigate which molecular lines are best suited for future massive disk studies .",
    "we observed the hmpo iras18089 - 1732 in 3 nights during the summer of 2004 with the sma in two configurations covering unprojected baseline lengths between 20 and 340 m .",

    "flux calibration was conducted with observations of uranus , callisto and 3c279 ( again for the largest baselines ) .",
    "the flux density scale is estimated to be accurate within 15% .",
    "for the phase and amplitude calibration we used regularly interleaved observations of the quasar nrao530 ( about @xmath16 from the target source ) with an approximate flux of @xmath17jy at the given frequency .",
    "we applied different weightings for the continuum and line data resulting in synthesized beams for the continuum of @xmath18 and for the lines of @xmath19 .",
    "the 1@xmath20 rms of the continuum image is 35mjy .",
    "figure [ continuum ] shows the continuum image with @xmath21 . in spite of some structure ,",
    "it remains a single source and does not split up into multiples .",
    "two corresponding amplitude versus uv - distance plots are shown in figure [ amp_uvdistance ] . while the shortest baselines show a halo component , the range between 50 and 90k@xmath22 appears rather flat consistent with the previously modeled point source @xcite .",
    "however , from 90k@xmath22 onward the flux densities decrease further , indicating additional sub - structure on the corresponding spatial scales . beyond 200k@xmath22 ,",
    "the s / n ratio is low , and in the 5k@xmath22 bin plot ( fig .",
    "[ amp_uvdistance]left ) one can not differentiate the emission from statistical noise .",
    "averaging the data into larger 40k@xmath22 bins to increase the s / n ratio ( fig .",

    "the large baseline data are consistent with a point source of approximate flux density @xmath23jy .",
    "the integrated flux density of the shorter baseline halo component can be fitted with a gaussian to @xmath24jy .    as a continuation of our radial profile study toward this source with single - dish 1.2 mm continuum observations ( with the mambo array at a spatial resolution of @xmath25 , @xcite )",
    ", we now attempted to derive radial intensity profiles from these higher spatial resolution data .",

    "offsets , respectively .",
    "the results and some fits to the data are shown in figure [ strip ] .",
    "obviously , the intensity profiles do vary significantly in the two directions with power - law indices between @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "thus , the typical approach of circular averaging is not useful here . nevertheless , to better quantify the errors often introduced by circular averaging , we restored the image with a circular beam of @xmath29 and derived the intensity profile using circular averaging .",
    "not surprisingly , the derived power law index ( not shown ) is between the ones shown in figure [ strip ] with an index of @xmath30 .",
    "one result to be kept in mind is that circular averaging has to be done cautiously , at least at this spatial resolution .",
    "table [ submm ] shows the submm continuum peak @xmath31 and integrated intensity @xmath32 . comparing these values with the previously derived continuum flux densities @xcite",
    ", we find nearly the same peak intensity but about three times the integrated flux densities .",
    "the synthesized beam of the new dataset is a bit smaller than that of last years observations ( @xmath21 vs. @xmath33 ) . however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ amp_uvdistance ] , data @xmath34k@xmath22 do not contribute strongly to the measurable flux densities , and thus finding similar peak fluxes densities in both datasets is reassuring that the calibration of the sma is reliable .",
    "the fact that we observe significantly higher integrated flux densities in the new dataset is due to the better uv - coverage we have this time . due to this better uv - coverage",
    "we suffer less from missing short spacings and recover more of the extended halo emission .",
    "nevertheless , measuring the integrated flux densities of the 850@xmath0 m single - dish scuba observations @xcite in an aperture with a radius of @xmath35 , we get an integrated flux density of @xmath36jy .",
    "thus , we only recover about 20% of the single - dish flux densities with the sma , the remaining 80% mostly reside in a larger - scale halo filtered out by the interferometer , and a smaller fraction of the integrated flux is lost because of the negative side - lobe emission .    following @xcite , assuming the submm continuum emission to be due to optically thin dust emission , we calculate the gas mass and column density of the central core . the procedure and equations we use",
    "are outlined in @xcite .",
    "based on the spectral index analysis from @xcite we assume a dust opacity index @xmath37 .",
    "furthermore , we calculate the gas mass @xmath38 on the one hand using a typical hot core temperature of 100k to better compare it with the results by @xcite , and on the other hand using the temperature of 350k derived from the ch@xmath1cn observations ( see  [ ch3cn ] ) . as discussed in @xcite , the errors are dominated by systematics , e.g. , the exact knowledge of the dust opacity index @xmath39 or the temperature .",
    "while we take different temperatures into account the other parameters are more difficult to acknowledge and we estimate the masses and column densities to be correct within a factor 5 .    assuming 100k we get a gas mass of 45m@xmath3 close to the 38m@xmath3 derived last year from the 1.3 mm continuum observations @xcite , whereas using the 350k results in a lower gas mas of 12m@xmath3 .",
    "the values will be compared below with the masses derived from the kinematic hcooch@xmath1 observations ( see  [ hcooch3 ] ) . regarding the gas column density @xmath40",
    ", both temperatures result in values of the order @xmath41@xmath42 , close to the column densities previously derived from the lower spatial resolution 1.3 mm data @xcite .",
    "assuming a relation between column density and extinction of @xmath43 we get a visual extinction of the order 1000 .",
    "figure [ spectra_uv ] shows vector - averaged spectra of the complete spectral setup taken on a short baseline of 26 m , and table [ lines ] lists the detected lines .",
    "line identification were conducted with the 350ghz spectral line survey by @xcite and the molecular line databases jpl @xcite and cdms @xcite . altogether 50 spectral lines from 18 species are observed ( we consider different isotopomers as different species : ch@xmath1oh , @xmath44ch@xmath1oh , so@xmath6 , @xmath45so@xmath6 , so , @xmath45so , c@xmath6h@xmath46oh , ch@xmath1och@xmath1 , nh@xmath6cho , c@xmath47s , cn , ocs , h@xmath6cs , hcooch@xmath1 , ch@xmath1cn , ch@xmath48cn , cch , hnco ) .",

    "[ hcooch3 ] .",
    "the lines we were originally mainly interested in , the ch@xmath1cn@xmath50 k - ladder , appear to be optically thick , and do not properly trace the most central core ( see  [ ch3cn ] ) .",
    "comparing the other molecular lines with the previously observed sio outflow emission leaving the core in the northern direction @xcite , some lines show contributions from the outflow as well , most strongly h@xmath6cs .",
    "most of the other species appear to peak close to the continuum emission   usually within @xmath12 corresponding to @xmath51au   but none directly toward it .",
    "interestingly , for most species this offset is toward the west and north - west , similar to the peculiar offset of the sio outflow axis @xcite . since we do not detect any companion source in the submm continuum data ( see also  [ discussion_cont ] ) , it is unlikely that a secondary source is causing this offset .",
    "it appears more plausible that shock interactions of the outflow with the ambient molecular core enhance the molecular abundances and thus at least partly cause the observed offsets .",
    "it is difficult to quantify the relative contributions from excitation , chemistry , opacity , outflow and other kinematic effects to the morphological differences between the various species , and likely an interplay of these effects has to be taken into account to explain all observational features .",
    "comparing the spatial extent of the 50% contour levels from some of the molecules in table [ area ] ( we selected just the strong ones with reasonable s / n ratio ) , we find that hcooch@xmath1 is confined most strongly , approximately within the same region as the 860@xmath0 m continuum emission , whereas all other molecules , even density tracers like ch@xmath1cn / ch@xmath1oh / c@xmath47s , are more extended . with hcooch@xmath1 peaking exactly toward the submm continuum peak and showing the smallest spatial extend , it appears to be one of the best dense gas tracers within this mini - line - survey .",
    "all ch@xmath1cn@xmath50 velocity channels peak offset from the mm continuum peak , and we can not distinguish a clear velocity structure ( fig .",
    "[ channel_ch3cn ] ) .",
    "the picture is similar for all 8 detected ch@xmath1cn@xmath50 k - lines ( k=0, ...",
    "while physical reasons like the above mentioned outflow contributions can account for some of the offsets , the rather random - like distribution of offsets in this channel map is indicative of high optical depths throughout the whole k - ladder ( see also the discussion about the spectral fits below ) .",
    "thus , the ch@xmath1cn@xmath50 lines appear not to be suited well as a disk tracer for this source .",
    "nevertheless , we can use the ch@xmath1cn k - ladder to get a temperature estimate of the core .",
    "for this purpose , we used the xclass superset of the class program ( schilke , priv .",
    "this software - package uses the line catalogs from jpl and cdms , @xcite ) .",
    "we tried to fit the whole ch@xmath1cn spectrum simultaneously assuming optically thin emission in local thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "figure [ ch3cn_fit ] presents the whole ch@xmath1cn@xmath50 spectrum toward the submm peak position and a model spectrum using a temperature of 350k and a ch@xmath1cn column density of @xmath52@xmath42 .",
    "this model fits the data good for the k=0,1,2,4,5,7 lines but bad for k=3,6 .",
    "the ortho - ch@xmath1cn ( a - species ) lines k=3,6 have double the statistical weight than the other observed lines , whereas the observed line strengths of the k=3,4,5,6 lines ( including para and ortho species ) are similar .",
    "the observed line ratio close to unity between ortho- and para - ch@xmath1cn lines is additional evidence for the large optical depths of the lines . in spite of these difficulties ,",
    "the temperature of 350k is consistent with our previous temperature estimate based on hcooch@xmath1 observations @xcite and thus gives a reasonable temperature for the central forming hot molecular core .",
    "in contrast to the ch@xmath1cn emission , hcooch@xmath1 traces the central dust emission well and thus appears to be likely optically thin .",
    "unfortunately , the spectral line at @xmath53ghz is weaker than most of the ch@xmath1cn lines , and it is a blend of two hcooch@xmath1 lines and the ch@xmath1cn(@xmath54 ) line ( see table [ lines ] ) .",
    "however , the energy levels of the hcooch@xmath1 lines are at @xmath55k whereas for ch@xmath1cn(@xmath54 ) it is at @xmath56k ( table [ lines ] ) .",

    "furthermore , using the rest - frequency of the hcooch@xmath1(@xmath57)-e line at 348.9095ghz , the line center is at 32km / s consistent with the line centers of other dense gas tracers , e.g. , ch@xmath1cn .",
    "the frequency of the corresponding hcooch@xmath1(@xmath57)-a line should be blue - shifted by @xmath58km / s but we do not find a significant secondary peak toward this velocity .",
    "likely , there is underlying emission from this a - type line , although at weaker intensities , but the spectrum is dominated by the hcooch@xmath1 line of the corresponding e - species .",

    "consistent with our previous investigation @xcite , we find a velocity shift in the east - west direction over the core observation near 216.966ghz with our new data , because in last year s analysis we set the rest - frequency to a central component of the line blend whereas for the new data it is set to the strongest component hcooch@xmath1(@xmath57)-e .",
    "this introduces slightly different velocity ranges for both observations , but it does not change the relative velocity shift over the source . ] .",
    "this can be depicted in the blue channels at 26 and 28km / s , which show compact emission close to and a bit east of the mm continuum peak , and the red channel at 34km / s , which shows compact emission west of the submm continuum peak .",
    "the intermediate channels at 30 and 32km / s show slightly more extended emission features .",
    "the fact that we see blue emission over a little bit wider velocity range than red emission may be due to the weaker hcooch@xmath1(@xmath57)-a line , which is blue - shifted with regard to the main hcooch@xmath1(@xmath57)-e line .",
    "the red emission of the hcooch@xmath1(@xmath57)-a line would then be undetectable because of the stronger ambient gas emission at 30 and 32km / s from the hcooch@xmath1(@xmath57)-e line .",
    "figure [ disk ] presents an overlay of the hcooch@xmath1 data binned into blue / central / red components . additionally , the outflow axis is sketched as traced by the sio(54 ) observations @xcite . with the rotation axis , defined by the high - density tracer hcooch@xmath1 ,",
    "being approximately perpendicular to the outflow axis , these observations in iras18089 - 1732 show a disk signature similar to those known from many low - mass sources ( e.g. , d tauri , @xcite ) .",
    "this confirms at higher spatial resolution our previously proposed disk scenario for this high - mass protostellar object . while the hcooch@xmath1 observations at 216.966ghz showed a p.a . of @xmath59 ( from north ) ,",
    "the axis of the new data is closer to @xmath60 .",
    "considering the different energy levels of the various hcoooch@xmath1 transitions ( @xmath61k & @xmath62k ) , this implies that the lower - energy - level transitions are more strongly affected by the infalling surrounding envelope .",
    "in contrast , the higher - energy - lines appear to be better probes of the actual underlying disk properties .",
    "the deconvolved source size of the integrated hcooch@xmath1 map in fig .  [ images ] is @xmath63au ( using the 50% contour as the observed image size ) , similar to the separation of the blue- and red - shifted hcooch@xmath1 peaks in fig .",

    "assuming equilibrium between the centrifugal and gravitational forces at the outer radius of the disk the enclosed dynamical mass can be estimated via :    @xmath65 & = &   1.13\\,10^{-3 } \\times v^2[\\rm{km / s}]\\times r[\\rm{au } ] \\label{eq2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath66 is the disk mass , @xmath67 the disk radius , in our case half the separation of the blue and red hcooch@xmath1 emission peaks at most extreme blue and red velocities , and @xmath68 the half width zero intensity ( hwzi ) of the spectral line .",

    "since there is some blending between the hcooch@xmath1(@xmath57 ) main e - type and weaker a - type line , we adopt a slightly smaller value of hwzi=@xmath72km / s for the hcooch@xmath1(@xmath57)-e transition . ] .",

    "as already noticed by several studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , in contrast to low - mass disks where the disk mass is usually negligible compared with the core mass , a considerable amount of the gas mass appears to be associated with large accretion disks and/or rotating envelopes in the central regions of high - mass star formation .",

    "the spatial distribution of the three lines is not exactly the same : the ch@xmath1oh(@xmath74 ) and ch@xmath1oh@xmath76 both show red emission to the west of the continuum peak but only weak or barely detectable blue emission to the east ( fig .  [ ch3oh_channel]top and bottom ) .",
    "contrary to this we can not discern such a signature in the ch@xmath1oh@xmath75 line , the emission peaks north and south of the submm continuum peak and seems to be affected by the outflow in that direction ( fig .",
    "[ ch3oh_channel]middle ) . while none of the lines shows a clear east - west velocity gradient indicative of the proposed disk as suggested by the previous ch@xmath1oh@xmath73 observations , the red emission of the ch@xmath1oh(@xmath74 ) and ch@xmath1oh@xmath76 lines are at least consistent with it .    since ch@xmath1oh is a slightly asymmetric rotor with a very rich spectrum in the mm and submm bands ( see table  [ lines ] or @xcite for a more detailed ch@xmath1oh discussion ) , it is interesting to investigate in what kind of environment one finds the molecule . as shown in table  [ lines ] , within the given bandpass we observe ch@xmath1oh lines spanning upper level energy ranges between 44 and 695k . since the lower energy ch@xmath1oh(@xmath74 )",
    "( @xmath77k ) and the higher energy ch@xmath1oh@xmath76 ( @xmath78k ) lines are more confined to the inner center than the intermediate energy ch@xmath1oh@xmath75 line ( @xmath79k ) , one could speculate that the temperatures within the outflow might be in the latter regime and thus influence this line most strongly . however , not all lines of the ch@xmath1oh@xmath80 series resemble the outflow - influenced morphology , but others also trace the inner core again ( e.g. , ch@xmath1oh@xmath81 ) . in the literature",
    "one finds cases where ch@xmath1oh traces the protostellar cores ( e.g. , @xcite ) as well as molecular outflows ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and currently it is not well understood which ch@xmath1oh line is suitable to trace one or the other effect .",
    "nevertheless , because ch@xmath1oh is a molecule with often more than one line in a given spectral setup , it is a potentially useful tool to investigate the different processes . since the ch@xmath1oh collisional rates were calculated recently @xcite , the potential of ch@xmath1oh as an interstellar tracer is likely going to be exploited more extensively than before ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting to see that even at this high spatial resolution iras18089 - 1732 still does not split up in any sub - fragments .",
    "the 3@xmath20 continuum sensitivity of 105mjy corresponds to a mass sensitivity of 0.3 , 0.7 , or 3.0m@xmath3 , depending on the assumed temperature which we set to 350k ( the derived ch@xmath1cn hot core temperature ) , 100k ( a more typical hot core temperature ) , and 30k ( which should be the temperature of the surrounding envelope ) , respectively . since potential lower - mass companions of an evolving massive cluster",
    "should be distributed a little bit further out from the central core ( e.g. , @xcite ) , lower temperature values of 100 and/or 30k appear to be a more realistic for potential companions .",
    "nevertheless , we find no companion down to a @xmath82 mass limit of 0.7 and 3m@xmath3 at 100 and 30k , respectively .",
    "the non - detection of any companion source supports the previous reasoning that the sio outflow is indeed emanating from the main massive submm continuum source and not caused by a lower - mass cluster member @xcite .",
    "the small offset of the sio outflow axis from the submm peak position ( @xmath10 , @xcite ) is still a bit puzzling , but it can likely be attributed to the underlying flow geometry and the resulting shock - induced local sio enhancements ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the single submm continuum peak is also distinctively different to the recent study by @xcite who found the hmpo iras19410 + 2336 to split up into a cluster of sources with a protocluster mass function resembling the stellar initial mass function .",
    "contrary to this , there exist other prominent examples which do not split up into clusters , e.g. , iras20126 + 4104 , but remain one mm continuum source down to the highest spatial resolution @xcite , similar to the case of iras18089 - 1732 .",
    "what is causing these observational differences ? on the one hand , it is possible that the study by @xcite had very favorable observational circumstances , because they observed iras19410 + 2336 in three configurations with the plateau de bure interferometer and thus had an exceptionally good uv - coverage sampling various spatial scales .",
    "our sma data have been observed with baselines not shorter than 20 m and thus does not trace the corresponding larger spatial scales , especially at this high frequencies . excluding the compact plateau de bure configuration , @xcite",
    "would not have detected that many sub - sources in iras19410 + 2336 as well . therefore , observational differences might account to some degree for the discussed differences . on the other hand",
    ", could it be possible that some massive star - forming regions evolve in a fragmenting cluster - like way like iras19410 + 2336 , whereas other star - forming regions exhibit the core - halo structure like iras18089 - 1732 at the earliest evolutionary stages and develop the cluster - like structure at later evolutionary stages ?",
    "this scenario would imply that at least for such kind of sources the massive cluster members would form first and the low- and intermediate - mass members later .",
    "one way to solve this question is to choose a number of similar sources ( similar in the sense of evolutionary stage , luminosity and distance ; iras20126 + 4104 and iras19410 + 2336 for example fulfill these criteria ) and observe all these sources with exactly the same interferometric configurations to trace the same spatial scales .",
    "if this experiment would still result in the same observational differences as encountered here , this would be a hint to the existence of a variety of evolutionary paths for massive star - forming regions .",
    "another result from the continuum study is that it is difficult to derive a consistent intensity distribution and thus density distribution on this small spatial scales because apparently iras18089 - 1732 is not symmetric at all .",
    "it is likely that the central core still harbors multiple unresolved sources which could cause these asymmetries . in any regard ,",
    "the usual approach of circular averaging and then deriving density distributions which are interpreted within one or the other theoretical model has to be approached cautiously and needs to be re - checked for each studied source separately .",
    "we are able to confirm the previously suggested disk / outflow scenario for the hmpo iras18089 - 1732 at higher spatial resolution .",
    "the hcooch@xmath1 velocity shift is approximately perpendicular to the sio outflow axis .",
    "however , even at this spatial resolution it is hard to judge whether we really trace a keplerian accretion disk ( keplerian in the sense of a keplerian velocity profile dominated by the central protostar ) or rather a rotating larger - scale envelope which rotates perpendicular to the outflow but which might not be keplerian at all .",
    "the fact that a large fraction of the central gas core appears to be associated with the rotation indicates that it might not be in keplerian motion .",
    "this implies a follow - up question whether massive accretion disks need to be keplerian like their low - mass counterparts , or whether massive disks may be non - keplerian , potentially self - gravitating structures ( self - gravitating in the sense that the gravitational potential of the disk - star system is dominated by the disk ) . while the observations toward prototypical high - mass disk source iras20126 + 4104 favor a keplerian disk , although with a central mass of @xmath83m@xmath3 it is not a very massive source ( e.g. , @xcite ) , other sources indicate disk masses well in excess of the central source ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for iras18089 - 1732",
    ", we find a rotating structure which is consistent with an accretion disk / rotating envelope , but unfortunately the data still lack the spatial resolution to study the physical structure of the disk .",
    "follow - up observations at higher angular resolution are one tool to tackle these questions .    in addition , the question posed in  [ intro ] to find the most suitable disk - tracing molecules has not been sufficiently answered .",
    "the previously successful molecule ch@xmath1cn has proved in this source as not suitable .",
    "it is not clear whether simply the chosen k - ladder line series is a bad one because the opacity @xmath84 scales with the frequency @xmath85 like :    @xmath86    with a the einstein coefficient , @xmath87 the line width , and @xmath88 the column density of the upper state .",
    "using the temperature estimate of 350k and assuming the same line width for all ch@xmath1cn line series , we can approximate the change in optical depth for the ch@xmath1cn line series in the 349ghz and 220ghz bands by :    @xmath89    in case the ch@xmath1cn column densities in both transitions are similar , which is given to first order in thermal equilibrium at the estimated temperature of 350k , the line opacity in the 860@xmath0 m band would be approximately 2.5 times larger than in the 1 mm band . therefore , higher optical depth at 860@xmath0 m could contribute to the observation that we do not find a disk signature in the ch@xmath1cn@xmath50 transitions .",
    "however , it is possible that already the 1 mm lines are optically thick which has to be checked via future observations of the latter line series .",
    "contrary to this , the hcooh@xmath1 molecule traces the disk - like structure in the 1 mm and the 860@xmath0 m band successfully and apparently does not suffer from too high opacity .",
    "however , in spite of its ubiquity in many spectral bands @xcite , spectral hcooch@xmath1 lines are often rather weak and and blended with various components , and therefore observationally more difficult to tackle .",
    "to start statistically significant studies of massive accretion disks , we still have to find a suitable molecular transition which unambiguously can trace disks and does not require a too large amount of observing time .",
    "in spite of these problems , it is promising that more and more massive disk candidates are being studied . with concerted efforts from various groups employing all available interferometers ,",
    "it is likely that we will get a much better understanding of massive disks over the next decade .",
    "fifty spectral lines from eighteen different species spanning an energy range from 17 to 747k were detected within the 4ghz bandpass at 860@xmath0 m .",
    "while the previously assumed best disk tracer ch@xmath1cn in this band is optically thick and thus not suitable for follow - up disk studies in this source , hcooch@xmath1 appears optically thin and shows a velocity - disk signature similar to well - known low - mass disk sources .",
    "the estimated mass of this rotating structure , assuming equilibrium between the gravitational and centrifugal forces , is 16/(sin@xmath2)m@xmath3 , of the same order as the core mass derived from the submm dust continuum emission .",
    "this implies that a significant fraction of the central core mass is associated with the rotation , and the assumed disk - like structure may not be keplerian . within this mini - line - survey",
    ", hcooch@xmath1 appears as one of the best disk - tracing molecules .",
    "although ch@xmath1cn@xmath50 is optically thick , we can use the k - ladder to estimate a temperature in the region .",
    "we find a temperature of approximately 350k , consistent with previous hcooch@xmath1 estimates @xcite , and a hot molecular core has already formed .",
    "even at @xmath90 spatial resolution , we do not detect any companion source in the field of view down to mass limits between 0.2 and 3m@xmath3 ( depending on the assumed temperature ) . since this finding is distinctively different to the recent study toward the hmpo iras19410 + 2336 it might indicate different evolutionary paths for the formation of massive clusters . however , observational systematics can also account for some of the differences , and more detailed investigations of various sources with the same observational settings are necessary to draw firm conclusions .",
    "furthermore , the central dust core is highly non - circular , indicating potential difficulties for circular averaged studies of intensity profiles at this high spatial resolution .",
