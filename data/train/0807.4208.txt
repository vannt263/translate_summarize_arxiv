    "clusters of galaxies are a unique probe of the growth and dynamics of structure in the universe .",
    "in particular , active mergers of sub - clusters provide a window to the processes by which massive clusters are assembled . in these systems , the galaxies and associated dark matter are essentially collisionless .",
    "in contrast , the ionized intracluster gas , typically at temperatures of @xmath10  k , is strongly interacting and experiences complex dynamics . in extreme cases , the normally associated dark matter and intracluster gas can be significantly separated .",
    "the bullet cluster ( 1e 065756 ) at @xmath11 , is a massive cluster consisting of two sub - clusters in the process of merging . the smaller sub - cluster or ",
    "bullet \" has passed through the larger main cluster .",
    "x - ray observations infer a bow shock velocity of @xmath124700 km / s  ( markevitch 2006 ) , while simulations of the collision yield a substantially lower speed for the sub - cluster ( springel & farrar 2007 ) .",
    "this collision is perpendicular to the line of sight , providing an ideal system for studying interacting sub - clusters  ( clowe et  al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the mass surface density of the bullet cluster has been measured using weak and strong gravitational lensing of light from background galaxies .",
    "there are significant angular offsets between the peaks of the x - ray surface brightness , which trace the baryonic gas through thermal bremsstrahlung emission , and the peaks of the lensing surface density , which are associated with the majority of the mass .",
    "the combined weak and strong lensing analyses of ( 2006 ) show that the main cluster and sub - cluster are separated from their associated x - ray peaks at @xmath13 and @xmath14 significance respectively .",
    "this result has been recognized as providing direct evidence for the presence of collisionless dark matter in this system  ( clowe et  al .",

    "this process distorts the planck blackbody spectrum of the cmb and produces a signal proportional to the gas pressure integrated along the line of sight . at @xmath16ghz ,",
    "the sze produces a temperature decrement with respect to the unperturbed cmb intensity .",
    "early detections of the sze in the bullet cluster include work by ( 1999 ) and ( 2004 ) .    unlike the x - ray surface brightness , the peak sze surface brightness for a given cluster is independent of redshift . therefore , the sze has the potential to be an effective probe of intracluster gas out to the redshifts at which clusters are assembled .",
    "sze measurements of galaxy clusters provide complementary constraints on cluster properties typically derived from x - ray measurements such as central electron density , core radius of the intracluster gas , cluster gas mass , and fraction of the total cluster mass in gas",
    ". since the sze and x - ray signals are proportional to the line - of - sight integral of the electron density and electron density squared respectively , sze results will be less sensitive to clumping of the intracluster gas .",

    "apex - sz is a receiver designed specifically for sze galaxy cluster surveys  ( schwan et  al . 2003 ; dobbs et  al . 2006 ; schwan et  al .",
    "2009 , in preparation ) .",
    "it is mounted on the 12-meter diameter apex telescope , located on the atacama plateau in northern chile  ( gsten et  al .",
    "the observing site was chosen for its extremely dry and stable atmospheric conditions .",
    "the mean atmospheric transmittance is frequently better than 95@xmath21 in the apex - sz frequency band at 150  ghz  ( peterson et  al .",
    "2003 ; chamberlain & bally 1995 ) .",
    "the telescope is capable of round - the - clock observations .",
    "three reimaging mirrors in the cassegrain cabin couple the apex telescope to the focal plane of apex - sz .",
    "we achieve the diffraction limited performance of the telescope across the entire 0.4field of view with a mean measured beam full width half maximum ( fwhm ) of 58 , and a measured beam solid angle of 1.5  arcmin@xmath22 , including measured sidelobes at the @xmath23  db level .",
    "the apex - sz receiver houses a cryogenic focal plane , operating at 0.3  k. the focal plane contains 330 horn - fed absorber - coupled superconducting transition - edge sensor bolometers  ( richards 1994 ; lee et  al .",

    "the measured optical bandwidth of the receiver is 40% narrower than the design goal of 38  ghz , resulting in lower sensitivity than anticipated .",
    "the large field of view of the apex - sz instrument is designed for surveying large areas of sky . in order to efficiently observe a single target",
    ", we use the circular scan pattern illustrated in figure  [ fig : scanpattern ] .",
    "the circle center is fixed in az / el coordinates for twenty circular sub - scans , with a total duration of 100 seconds .",
    "this choice has a number of important advantages .",
    "the sky signal is modulated so that it appears in the timestream at frequencies higher than atmospheric drifts and readout @xmath28 noise .",
    "in addition , the circle scan has a moderate continuous acceleration ; the lack of high acceleration turn - arounds makes it possible to achieve a high observing efficiency .",

    "the small disk in the lower left indicates the 58  mean fwhm beam for a single bolometer.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    observations of the bullet cluster were conducted over a period of seven days in august 2007 , when the cluster was visible between the hours of 03:00 and 15:00 local time .",
    "the weather over this period was typical for the site , with precipitable water vapor varying between 0.25 and 1.5 mm , and a median atmospheric transmittance of @xmath32 .",
    "for the analysis in this paper , 235 scans are used , each scan consisting of twenty 5-s circular sub - scans , for a total of 6.4 hours of on - source data .",
    "the response of the receiver to astronomical sources is measured with daily raster scans of mars over every bolometer in the array . for each bolometer ,",
    "the observations provide a primary flux calibration and a high signal - to - noise beam profile from which we determine beam parameters such as size , ellipticity , and position with respect to the array - center pointing .",
    "additional observations of rcw57 and rcw38 are used to monitor gain stability , and frequent observations of bright quasars near the cluster source are used to monitor pointing stability .",
    "the wmap satellite has been used to calibrate the brightness temperature of mars at @xmath33ghz in five measurement periods spanning several years ( hill et  al .",
    "the wmap mars temperatures are tied to the cmb dipole moment and are accurate to better than @xmath34 .",
    "the brightness temperature of mars changes significantly ( @xmath35 ) as a function of its orbit and orientation .",
    "we use a version of the rudy model ( rudy et  al . 1987 ; muhleman & berge 1991 ) , that has been updated and maintained by bryan butler , to transfer the wmap mars temperature results to the apex - sz frequency band and specific times of our mars observations .    after applying a constant scaling factor",
    ", we find the rudy model predictions for the mars brightness temperature to be in excellent agreement with the wmap measurements .",
    "we find that the rudy model brightness temperatures at @xmath33ghz are systematically a factor of @xmath36 higher than those measured by wmap in the five published observation periods .",
    "in contrast , repeating the same exercise with the thermal model developed by ( 1976 , 2007 ) , as implemented in the online jcmt - fluxes program , results in a scaling factor of @xmath37 .",
    "this is consistent with the 10% rescaling of this model called for in ( 2009 ) , but the scaling factor exhibits significantly larger rms scatter than that of the rudy model .",
    "we therefore use the wmap @xmath33ghz calibrated rudy model to compute the mars brightness temperatures at @xmath16ghz for the specific times of our mars observations by reducing the rudy model @xmath16ghz temperatures by a factor of 1.052 .",
    "the rudy model @xmath33ghz to @xmath16ghz frequency scaling factor is @xmath38 at the times of our mars observations , and we adopt the rms scatter in this frequency scaling factor as an estimate of its uncertainty . combining the uncertainties in the wmap",
    "mars calibration , the wmap to rudy model scaling factor at @xmath33ghz , and the rudy model frequency scaling factor , we estimate the uncertainty in mars temperature to be @xmath39 .",
    "the measured signals from the calibrators are corrected for atmospheric opacity , which is measured with a sky dip observation at the beginning and end of each day s observations .",
    "measured zenith transmittance over the observing period ranged between 0.92 and 0.98 , with a median of 0.97 .",
    "based on the observed temporal variability of the opacity , drifts in atmospheric opacity between the sky dip and observation contribute @xmath40 to the overall calibration uncertainty . after correcting for the atmospheric opacity",
    ", we find that the mars temperature measured by apex - sz varies from the model prediction by up to @xmath41 over the course of the observation period .",
    "this gain variation is included as a source of error in the final calibration uncertainty .",
    "the apex - sz observing band center is measured with a fourier transform spectrometer to be @xmath42 ghz . the uncertainty in the band center results in a @xmath43 uncertainty in extrapolation of the mars based calibration to cmb temperature .",
    "the beam shape , including near sidelobes , is characterized by creating a beam map from mars observations , combining the same bolometer channels that are used to make the science maps .",
    "we adjust the calibration and measured beam size for the small ( @xmath44 ) correction due to the @xmath45 angular size of mars .",
    "we estimate a fractional uncertainty in the beam solid angle of @xmath46 .",
    "the apex - sz detectors operate in a state of strong negative electrothermal feedback which results in a linear response to changes in the input optical power .",
    "we have measured the response of the detectors during sky dips between @xmath47 and @xmath48 elevation ( antenna temperature difference @xmath49k ) , and find no significant deviation from the expected linear response to loading .",
    "we therefore conclude that detector non - linearity makes a negligible contribution to the calibration uncertainty .    slowly changing errors in telescope pointing result in both a pointing uncertainty and a flux calibration uncertainty due a broadening of the effective beam pattern . to measure pointing errors during our observations , we observe a bright quasar within a few degrees of the bullet cluster every 12 hours , and apply a pointing correction as needed .",
    "the typical rms pointing variations of the apex telescope between quasar observations is @xmath50 .",
    "this pointing uncertainty results in a slightly larger effective beam for the coadded maps than is measured with the individual calibrator maps .",
    "the correction to the flux calibration of the coadded maps due to pointing uncertainty is negligible , particularly for the observation of extended objects such as the bullet cluster .",
    "we estimate the pointing uncertainty in the coadded maps to be @xmath51 in both the ra and dec directions .",
    "the uncertainty in the cmb temperature calibration of the apex - sz maps is summarized in table  [ tbl : cal ] .",

    "the data consist of 280 bolometer timestreams sampled at 100 hz , telescope pointing data interpolated to the same rate , housekeeping thermometry data , bolometer bias and readout configuration data , and other miscellaneous monitoring data .",
    "the fundamental observation unit is a scan comprising twenty 5-s circular sub - scans in az / el coordinates , allowing the source to drift through the field of view ( fov ) , as described in ",
    "[ sec : observations ] above .",
    "data reduction consists of cuts to remove poor - quality data , filtering of @xmath28 and correlated noise due to atmospheric fluctuations , and binning the bolometer data into maps .",
    "these steps are described in more detail below .",
    "timestream data are first parsed into individual circular sub - scans .",
    "we reject @xmath59% of the data at the beginning and end of the scan where the telescope deviates from the constant angular velocity circular pattern .",
    "we reject bolometer channels that are optically or electronically unresponsive , or lack high - quality flux calibration data ; typically , 160200 of the 280 bolometer channels remain after these preliminary cuts . the large number of rejected channels is due primarily to low fabrication yield for two of the six bolometer sub - array wafers .",
    "we reject spikes and step - like glitches caused by cosmic rays or electrical interference .",
    "these are infrequent and occur on time scales faster than the detector optical time constant .",
    "we use a simple signal - to - noise cut on the data to reject these , since the timestream is noise dominated even for the @xmath121  mk bullet cluster signal .",
    "step - like glitches are often correlated across many channels in the array , so we reject data from all channels whenever a spike or glitch in @xmath60 of the channels is detected .",
    "these cuts result in a loss of 8% of the remaining data .    for each circular sub - scan , we also reject channels that have excessive noise in signal band , resulting in a loss of 19% of the remaining data .      after the timestream data cuts , fluctuations in atmospheric emission",
    "produce the dominant signal in the raw bolometer timestreams .",
    "the atmospheric signal is highly correlated across the array , which can be exploited to remove the signal . principal component analysis ( pca )",
    "has been used by some groups to reduce the atmospheric signal ( see , e.g. , scott et  al . 2008 ; laurent et  al . 2005 ) .",
    "however , the effect of pca filtering on the source is difficult to predict and is a function of the atmospheric conditions .",
    "we have developed an analysis strategy that reduces the atmospheric signal through the application of spatial filters that have a constant and well understood effect on the signals we are attempting to measure .",
    "atmospheric fluctuation power is expected to follow a kolmogorov spatial power spectrum , with most power present on scales larger than the separation between beams as they pass through the atmosphere , resulting in an atmospheric signal that is highly correlated across the array . to reduce these fluctuations , we first remove a polynomial and an elevation dependent airmass opacity model from each channel s timestream , then",
    "remove a first - order two - dimensional spatial polynomial across the array for each time - step .",
    "this algorithm is described in detail in the two following subsections .",
    "this atmospheric fluctuation removal strategy requires that both the spatial extent of the scan pattern and the instantaneous array fov are larger than the source .",
    "the @xmath61 radius circular scan and the 23@xmath62 array fov allow us to recover most of the bullet cluster s flux , but some extended emission is lost as is described in  [ sec : results ] .",
    "we observe scan - synchronous signals in the bolometer timestreams due to elevation - dependent atmospheric emission .",
    "the optical path length @xmath63 through the atmosphere is proportional to the cosecant of the elevation angle @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "the change in optical path - length is nearly a linear function of elevation angle over the @xmath61 circular scan radius . in the circular drift scans , this modulation of the elevation - dependent opacity produces an approximately sinusoidal modulation in the bolometer timestream . for each channel in each scan , we simultaneously fit and remove an atmospheric model consisting of this cosecant function plus an order 20 polynomial ( one degree of freedom per circular sub - scan ) to remove slow drifts in the atmospheric opacity and readout @xmath28 noise . this scheme effectively removes the common scan - induced atmospheric signal as well as most of the atmospheric fluctuation power below the frequency of the circular sub - scan ( 0.20 hz ) , while only modestly affecting the central bullet cluster signal .      removing the cosecant - plus - polynomial model from the timestream data reduces low - frequency atmospheric fluctuation power , but not higher frequency power corresponding to smaller spatial scales near those where the cluster signal occurs . to reduce these fluctuations ,",
    "the atmosphere can be modeled as a spatially correlated signal across the array pixel positions on the sky with a low - order two - dimensional polynomial function . at each time step",
    ", we fit and remove a low - order two - dimensional polynomial function across the array , similar to the procedure described in sayers ( 2007 ) . the relative gain coefficients for each bolometer channel",
    "are calculated by taking the ratio of each channel s timestream , which is dominated by correlated atmospheric noise , to a median timestream signal generated from all channels . with the favorable atmospheric conditions of these observations , we find that a first order spatial polynomial ( offset and tilt ) is adequate to remove most of the atmospheric signal while preserving the cluster signal",
    ".    bolometer channels with excess uncorrelated noise are more easily identified after removing the correlated atmospheric noise component ; we reject these noisy channels , then perform the spatially correlated signal removal a second time .      the atmospheric removal algorithms described above act as a high - pass filter .",
    "they suppress signals on scales comparable to the scan length or the focal plane fov .",
    "the cluster emission can be quite extended , and therefore the data reduction filtering process attenuates diffuse flux in the cluster signal and produces small positive sidelobes around the cluster decrement . the data reduction pipeline filters can be tailored , within limits , to meet various scientific objectives .",
    "thus , our primary data products consist of two different high signal - to - noise maps of the cluster .    for one map",
    ", we mask a circular region centered on the cluster source prior to fitting the timestream and spatial filters described in  [ sec : atmremoval ] , then apply the resulting filter functions to the entire data set , including the source region .",
    "the source - mask procedure prevents the cluster signal within the masked region from influencing the baseline fits , and thus reduces attenuation of the source central decrement and extended emission at the expense of increasing the contribution of low - frequency noise in the map center .",
    "we choose a source - mask radius of @xmath66 as a compromise between attenuation of diffuse emission and increased map noise .",
    "we use the source - masked map to visually interpret the morphology and extended emission in the cluster .",
    "these results are discussed in ",
    "[ subsec : tempmap ] .",
    "we also produce a map in which we do not mask the source when applying filters .",
    "the non - source - masked map is used for model parameter estimation because it has higher signal to noise in the central region of the map .",
    "in addition , it is easier to take into account the effects of the data reduction filters , or transfer function , on the underlying sky intensity distribution , which is necessary for comparing the data to the model for parameter estimation .",
    "the fitting procedure and results are described in more detail in  [ subsec : fitting ] .    for each of the two maps ,",
    "the post - cut , filtered timestream data are binned in angular sky coordinates to create maps . for a given scan ,",
    "a map is created from each bolometer channel , applying the channel s pointing offset and flux calibration .",
    "a coadded scan map is created by combining individual channel maps with minimum variance weighting in each pixel , using the sample variance of the conditioned timestream data in the scan .",
    "the final coadded map is created by combining all scan maps , again with minimum variance weighting in each pixel .",
    "we bin maps at a resolution of 10  to oversample the beam .",
    "the source - masked map that we present in  [ sec : results ] is convolved with a 1  fwhm gaussian to smooth noise fluctuations to the angular size of the beam .",
    "however , the radial profiles presented below and the non - source - masked map used for model fitting do not include this additional smoothing .",
    "figures [ fig : bulletcoadd ]  and  [ fig : bulletcoaddzoom ] show the source - masked temperature map from our observations of the bullet cluster .",
    "the map has a resolution of 85  fwhm which results from the combination of the 58  instrumental beam , the data reduction filters , and a final 1  fwhm gaussian smoothing of the map .",
    "the source - masked map is shown in order to provide a more accurate representation of the extended emission and cluster morphology .",
    "the noise in the central region of the source - masked map is 55  @xmath67 per 85  fwhm resolution element . near the cluster center ,",
    "the emission hints at elongation in the east - west direction , which is along the axis between the main and sub - cluster gas detected in the x - ray , see  [ sec : xray ] .",
    "the more extended emission appears to be elongated in the northwest - southeast direction , which is the major axis of the best - fit elliptical @xmath3 model discussed in ",
    "[ subsec : fitting ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : bulletcoaddzoom ] shows the centroid position of the best - fit elliptical @xmath3 model , and the position of the dust obscured , lensed galaxy detected at 270  ghz by ( 2008 ) . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : source_contributions ] , we see no evidence for emission from this source in our 150  ghz map .    radial profiles for the unsmoothed source - masked and non - source - masked maps are shown in figure  [ fig : radial_plots ] . the source - masked map has a signal - to - noise of 10 within the central 1  radius , compared to 23 for the non - source - masked map , due to the fact that source - masking allows more large - scale atmospheric fluctuation noise to remain in the map . however , the source - masked map preserves signal on larger spatial scales than the non - source - masked map . in both the source - masked and non - source - masked maps ,",
    "the sky intensity distribution is filtered by the instrument beam and data reduction pipeline described in  [ sec : datareduction ] .",
    "we do not renormalize the map amplitudes , since the source is extended and an assumption would need to be made about the shape of the sky - brightness distribution to do so .",

    "we assume the cluster gas is well - described by an isothermal @xmath3 model , and is in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "these assumptions are unphysical in the case of the bullet cluster , which is a dynamically complex merging system where the gas is separated from the rest of the mass  ( clowe et  al .",
    "2006 ) . however , we find that with the sensitivity and spatial resolution of the observations , these assumptions yield an adequate description of the observed emission .",

    "we characterize this transfer function by creating a map from a simulated point source , convolved with the instrument beam , and inserted into a noiseless timestream , similar to the method described in ( 2008 ) .",

    "the above approach to noise covariance estimation is chosen for its simplicity and because we do not have enough linear combinations of individual scan maps to fully sample the noise covariance matrix using jackknife noise maps .",
    "but , the method relies on several simplifying assumptions , including that the bolometer noise is stationary for each 100-s scan , the timestream noise is uncorrelated from scan to scan , and the map coverage is uniform .",
