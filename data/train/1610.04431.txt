    "similarly for aging laponite suspensions as investigated in earlier work @xcite , the vft equation is as follows :    @xmath61    in this equation , @xmath62 , @xmath63 is the fragility parameter ( the inverse of @xmath63 quantifies the apparent deviation from the arrhenius trend ) , and @xmath64 is the waiting time at which the relaxation time diverges . for the data plotted in fig.1(b ) ,",

    "such a vft like growth of @xmath43 with increasing @xmath1 as the laponite suspension approaches eventual kinetic arrest is strongly reminiscent of the observations reported in fragile molecular supercooled liquids with decreasing temperature @xmath4 and in many hard sphere colloidal glasses with increasing volume fraction @xmath6 .",
    "typically , the fragile behavior of glass - forming liquids as they approach the glass transition is rationalized by enumerating the number of particles engaged in slow correlated motion , @xmath16 , in the dhs and the growing sizes of these regions of cooperative motion . moreover ,",

    "this suggests that at small sample ages , the relaxation timescales characterising the reorganization dynamics is more likely to have values within a narrow range .",

    "in contrast to molecular systems , colloidal particles have comparatively larger sizes ( 10 @xmath40 m - 10 @xmath31 m ) .",

    "<S> an aqueous suspension of the synthetic clay laponite can undergo a transition from a liquid - like ergodic state to a glass - like nonergodic arrested state . in an observation that closely resembles the dynamical slowdown observed in supercooled liquids subjected to a rapid temperature quench , the phenomenon of kinetic arrest in laponite suspensions is accompanied by a growth in the @xmath0-relaxation or structural relaxation time with increasing sample aging time , @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the ubiquitous dynamic slowdown and fragile behavior observed in glass forming liquids approaching the glass transition is typically ascribed to the heterogeneous dynamics and the growth in the size of distinct dynamical heterogeneities . in this article , we present the characterization of the dynamical heterogeneities in aging colloidal laponite clay systems by invoking the three - point dynamic susceptibility formalism . the average time - dependent two - point intensity autocorrelation and its sensitivity to the control parameter @xmath2 are probed in dynamic light scattering experiments . </S>",
    "<S> distributions of relaxation time scales deduced from kohlrausch - williams - watts equation widen with increasing @xmath2 signifying the heterogeneous dynamic slowdown . a suitable formalism to calculate three - point correlation function is employed for aging colloidal suspension where the main control parameter is @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated three - point dynamic susceptibility exhibits a peak , with the peak height increasing with evolving @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the number of dynamically correlated particles , deduced from the peak - height , is seen to initially increase with increasing @xmath3 at a fast rate , before eventually slowing down close to the non - ergodic transition point . </S>",
    "<S> this observation is in agreement with published reports on supercooled liquids . </S>",
    "<S> our study confirms the presence and growth of dynamical heterogeneities in soft glassy suspensions of laponite , thereby shedding new light on the fragile supercooled liquid - like dynamics of aging suspensions of these anisotropic , charged , colloidal clay nanoparticles . </S>"
