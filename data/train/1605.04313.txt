    "<S> we report the discovery and classification of sdss  j053341.43 + 001434.1 ( sdss0533 ) , an early - l dwarf first discovered during a powerful @xmath0 magnitude flare observed as part of the asas - sn survey . </S>",
    "<S> optical and infrared spectroscopy indicate a spectral type of l0 with strong h@xmath1 emission and a blue nir spectral slope . combining the photometric distance , proper motion , and radial velocity of sdss0533  yields three - dimensional velocities of @xmath2  km  s@xmath3 , indicating that it is most likely part of the thick disk population and probably old . </S>",
    "<S> the three detections of sdss0533  obtained during the flare are consistent with a total @xmath4-band flare energy of at least @xmath5  ergs ( corresponding to a total thermal energy of at least @xmath6  erg ) , placing it among the strongest detected m dwarf flares . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of this powerful flare on an old l0 dwarf may indicate that stellar - type magnetic activity persists down to the end of the main sequence and on older ml transition dwarfs . </S>"
