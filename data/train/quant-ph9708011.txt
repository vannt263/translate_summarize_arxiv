    "a quantum system interacting with its environment can be described , in the markovian approximation , by two complementary approaches . in the first and most",
    "commonly used @xcite , the system is represented by a density operator and its evolution is described by a master equation . in the second a state vector represents the system and a stochastic schrdinger equation describes the state evolution @xcite these two treatments are equivalent in the following sense : for all times an ensemble of state vectors generated by a stochastic schrdinger equation reproduces , on average , the density operator generated by the master equation .",
    "the correspondence is not uniquely defined , in that for a single master equation there are many associated stochastic equations .",
    "stochastic state vector equations , also called _ unravelings _ of the master equation , have been introduced in different contexts and with different interpretations . in the fundamental theory of quantum measurement",
    ", stochastic equations have been used to describe the general dynamical process of the state collapse into an eigenstate of the measured observable , i.e. _ localization _ @xcite . in quantum optics , stochastic schrdinger equations",
    "have been used to describe the system state conditioned by measurement outcomes . in this context",
    ", an unraveling corresponds to a specified measurement scheme , such as photon counting , heterodyne or homodyne detection @xcite .",
    "more generally , in the field of open quantum systems , unravelings have been used as an efficient numerical method to solve the master equation @xcite .",
    "the present work is motivated by a recent study of a quantum system in interaction with a thermal bath using the quantum jump ( qj ) unraveling @xcite .",
    "it is shown that , under some assumptions valid in the classical limit , the qj trajectories , i.e. , the realization of the stochastic process , approach a diffusive limit very similar to the one exhibited by the quantum state diffusion ( qsd ) trajectories .",
    "since diffusion is expected to be a general feature associated with the emergence of classicality , a description of the whole set of continuous unravelings becomes important .",
    "this set is introduced in a unified way in the following section .",
    "we will show that each continuous unraveling can be characterized very simply by specifying its noise correlations .",
    "the set of continuous unravelings is then used to study how quantum state properties , such as localization , evolve when the unraveling changes .",
    "a very important characteristic of quantum trajectories which has both physical and numerical consequences is the localization of quantum states toward eigenstates of the environment operator . working with the real noise unraveling ( rn ) ,",
    "gisin  @xcite has shown that for an arbitrary hermitian lindblad operator @xmath0 the state vectors concentrate on the eigenspace of @xmath0 .",
    "percival  @xcite extended this result by giving a proper definition of the ensemble localization of an arbitrary operator and then providing analytical bounds for the rate of self - localization of hermitian and nonhermitian lindblad operators for the quantum state diffusion unraveling . for a dissipative interaction , garraway and knight @xcite",
    "have presented numerical simulations of the localization process using the qj and qsd unravelings .",
    "starting from different quantum states , such as a superposition of two coherent states , a fock state and a squeezed ground state , they have shown that such states are highly sensitive to dissipation .",
    "they also illustrated the localization process .",
    "recently they have applied their results to describe the evolution of a schrdinger cat state in a kerr medium where localization competes with nonlinear effects @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .    for numerical simulation of open quantum systems ,",
    "individual trajectories have proven advantageous over density operator computations .",
    "the main advantages stem from the fact that less space is needed to store and propagate in time a state vector than a density matrix .",
    "in addition , for trajectory methods one can exploit the localization property to reduce the number of basis states needed to represent the state vector , thus significantly reducing the time needed to calculate quantum trajectories . for quantum jump unravelings , when many lindblad operators are present , it is well known that one can perform a unitary transformation to select one of the quantum jumps unravelings , in such a way as to minimize the number of basis states needed ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an application of this property ) .",
    "the localization of the state vector for qsd has been exploited in the mixed representation of steimle and al . @xcite and the moving basis of schack and al .",
    "@xcite .    in section [ secloc ]",
    "we use the set of continuous unravelings to describe localization properties for a single environment operator .",
    "several well known results are recovered for a hermitian operator @xcite . in the case of a non - hermitian operator the minimal rate of localization introduced for the qsd unraveling @xcite",
    "is extended to the complete set showing that localization is a general feature shared by all the continuous unravelings , and a new unraveling is introduced .",
    "some theoretical arguments supported by numerical simulations suggest that this new unraveling possesses the highest localization rate .    in the present work we make use of the freedom of choice for the noise correlations to obtain the continuous unraveling which localizes the state vector the most .",
    "this transformation should not be confused with the unitary transformation discussed above .",
    "these two transformations are complementary and can be used together . at the end of section [ secloc ]",
    "we compare the localization properties of qsd and of our proposed unraveling .",
    "finally , in section [ secdiscussion ] we summarize our results and draw conclusions about the applicability of the set of continuous unravelings to the study of the quasi - classical limit of open quantum systems .",
    "we proceed following closely the derivation of the quantum state diffusion unraveling by gisin and percival @xcite . in this work ,",
    "a general stochastic differential equation with a complex wiener process is used as a starting point . the drift and noise terms",
    "are then specified by asking that the stochastic differential equation recovers on average the lindblad master equation for the density operator @xmath1 of the system @xmath2 + \\sum_{j=1}^j \\left ( l_j \\rho l_j^\\dagger - { 1\\over2 } \\ { l_j^\\dagger l_j , \\rho \\ } \\right ) , \\label{eqmaster}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the system hamiltonian and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) the set of lindblad operators which represent the influence of the environment .",
    "( since the master equation ( [ eqmaster ] ) is valid under a markovian approximation , all the stochastic differential equations considered apply only within this approximation ) . the other conditions needed to specify the drift and noise terms are that the state remains normalized and that the stochastic equation shares the same invariance properties under unitary transformations as the master equation .",
    "this last constraint is used to prove the uniqueness of qsd among the set of continuous unravelings . removing the constraint of invariance under unitary transformations among the lindblad operators , we obtain the set of continuous norm - preserving unravelings related to the master equation .",
    "we start by considering a general stochastic differential equation of the following it form which gives the variation @xmath6 of the state vector @xmath7 in a time @xmath8 @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are vectors , @xmath12 are complex numbers and @xmath13 independent real wiener processes @xcite which obey the following relationships @xmath14 where @xmath15 represents the ensemble average .",
    "the two conditions to be respected by the previous equation ( [ eqstocha ] ) are ( @xmath16 ) the state is normalized for all times @xmath17 and ( @xmath18 ) for each time , the mean of the projector associated to the state @xmath7 gives the density matrix @xmath19 with the density matrix @xmath1 evolving according to the master equation in lindblad form ( [ eqmaster ] ) . in the following",
    ", these two conditions will be used to relate the drift term @xmath10 and the stochastic term @xmath11 to the state @xmath7 as well as giving constraints on the complex numbers @xmath12 .",
    "notice that the @xmath12 may also depend on the state @xmath7 and on time @xmath20 .    by following closely the qsd derivation given in reference @xcite",
    ", we obtain the expression for the drift term @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the expectation value of @xmath4 for the state @xmath7 .",
    "the drift term @xmath10 is the same as that obtained in the qsd derivation , but the stochastic vectors @xmath11 become @xmath23 which differs from the qsd derivation by the introduction of the normalization factor @xmath24 and the set of complex numbers @xmath25 .",
    "the latter are arbitrary coefficients of a @xmath26 unitary matrix which arises due to the freedom of choice in the linear combination of vectors @xmath27 used to express @xmath11 .",
    "finally one gets the equation for the state vector increment @xmath28 this equation shows that all the indeterminacy due to the coefficients @xmath12 and to the unitary transformation @xmath29 can be included in the noise terms @xmath30 which are given by @xmath31 it can be seen easily that they have zero mean @xmath32 and correlations @xmath33 where @xmath34 are correlation coefficients related to the unitary transformation @xmath29 and the noise coefficients @xmath35 in the following way @xmath36 and @xmath37 are complex numbers inside the unit circle @xmath38 for all @xmath39 ( see appendix ) . notice that although the stochastic process is completely specified by the numbers @xmath25 and @xmath35 , that specification will be non - unique in that all sets of numbers that yield the same correlation coefficients @xmath34 through equation ( [ eqnoise3 ] ) will describe the same stochastic process @xcite .",
    "thus an unraveling is completely specified when the correlation coefficients @xmath34 are given .",
    "this result provides a natural classification for continuous stochastic schrdinger equations associated with the completely positive master equation ( [ eqmaster ] ) . in ref",
    "@xcite a similar classification is given for all ( markovian ) positive master equations but only for two dimensional hilbert spaces .",
    "this suggests that the same classification procedure can be extended to every positive master equation in arbitrary dimensions .    in the absence of a unitary transformation @xmath40 and with only one wiener process @xmath41 , the complex noises @xmath30 are necessarily of the form @xmath42 . for @xmath43 we recover the real noise unraveling and for @xmath44 the imaginary noise unraveling .",
    "the present work shows not only that any phase @xmath45 can be chosen but also that the phase can be a smooth function of the state @xmath7 and of the time .",
    "the qsd unraveling is recovered taking two wiener processes ( @xmath46 ) with @xmath47 for all @xmath48 . in this special case",
    "the correlations @xmath34 vanish .",
    "let us introduce the following unitary transformation among lindblad operators @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are complex numbers and @xmath52 a unitary matrix  @xcite . with this transformation",
    "the noise terms become @xmath53 with the correlations @xmath54 these correlations will depend on the unitary transformation @xmath52 unless all the correlation factors vanish , i.e. @xmath55 . since @xmath29 is itself a unitary transformation , a necessary condition for invariance under unitary transformation is given by @xmath56 when only one wiener process @xmath41 is present , the unitary invariance condition ( [ equnitinvcond ] ) implies @xmath57 for all @xmath48 . as a consequence",
    "there is no invariant unraveling with only one wiener process . with two wiener processes @xmath46 ,",
    "the invariance condition becomes @xmath58 .",
    "the norm of the two complex numbers is the same @xmath59 and the phases are related by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is any integer number .",
    "the simplest case @xmath62 leads to @xmath63 which correspond to the complex noise used in the qsd unraveling when the phases @xmath45 are set to zero .",
    "the simplest case which can satisfy the invariance condition ( [ equnitinvcond ] ) is given by the qsd unraveling .",
    "the phases @xmath45 and other choices of @xmath61 introduce only irrelevant phase factors which can be neglected .",
    "this is the uniqueness result of gisin and percival for qsd . if one considers more than two wiener processes @xmath64 , it is possible to construct other unravelings invariant under unitary transformation .",
    "for instance : @xmath65 where we have omitted the index @xmath48 and the phase factor . since all these unravelings have the same correlations @xmath66 and @xmath67 , they are equivalent  @xcite and can be replaced by the qsd unraveling .",
    "as an application of the set of continuous unraveling obtained in the present work , one can compute the rate of self - localization of a single environment operator @xmath0 for a wide open system , i.e. @xmath68 , and determine the effect of the noise correlation on the rate of self - localization .",
    "the rate of self - localization is defined as the rate at which the ensemble average of the quantum mean square deviation decays @xcite .",
    "it is also the ensemble average rate at which the state vector @xmath7 tends towards one of the ( right- ) eigenstates of the lindblad operator .",
    "the quantum mean square deviation of the operator @xmath0 is defined as @xmath69 .",
    "more generally the quantum covariance of two operators for the state @xmath7 is @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "note that the quantum covariance of @xmath0 with itself is just the quantum mean square deviation @xmath71 .",
    "we restrict our attention to a wide open system because we want to describe the localization process , independently of the action of the hamiltonian .",
    "this , clearly , is only a first step towards a proper understanding of localization which should involve hamiltonian effects as well .      for a wide open system with a hermitian environment operator @xmath72",
    "the state vector @xmath7 evolves according to @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a noise of the kind previously described by ( [ eqnoise1 ] ) and ( [ eqnoise2 ] ) with an associated correlation factor @xmath75 given by @xmath76 .",
    "when the state evolves according to equation ( [ eqstate1l ] ) we can compute the change in the expectation value of @xmath0 @xmath77 and the change in the quantum mean square deviation @xmath78 where we have used the notation @xmath79 . the diffusion of the expectation value @xmath80 and the quantum mean square deviation is produced only by the real part of the noise term @xmath74 .    taking",
    "the ensemble mean shows that the expectation value @xmath81 remains constant and the quantum mean square deviation evolves as @xmath82 the noise correlation @xmath75 is a characteristic signature of the chosen unraveling . for @xmath83 , the quantum state diffusion result , giving a minimal localization rate of 2 ,",
    "is recovered @xcite . in this case , as in almost all cases , the mean square deviation tends to zero , thus the state @xmath7 evolves towards one eigenstate of @xmath0 .",
    "the real noise ( rn ) unraveling @xmath84 is clearly the one which gives the highest rate of self - localization . as a consequence , for numerical simulations involving an arbitrary hamiltonian and one hermitian environment operator ,",
    "the rn unraveling should be used since it will produce the fastest localization ( for continuous unravelings ) . in the opposite case to the rn unraveling ,",
    "if one uses the imaginary noise unraveling @xmath85 , the mean localization rate vanishes and the state does not evolve towards an eigenstate of @xmath0 . recovering these well known results",
    "@xcite confirms the validity of equation ( [ eqstate1l ] ) .",
    "we consider the case of a single non hermitian lindblad operator .",
    "since this case is more difficult to treat , we restrict ourselves to the more specific case of an annihilation operator @xmath86 . as for",
    "a hermitian operator , we want to determine which is the unraveling with the highest localization rate and find out if there is any unraveling which does not localize .",
    "the state vector evolves according to equation ( [ eqstate1l ] ) and the change in the quantum mean square deviation @xmath87 is given by @xmath88 which involves the quantum covariance @xmath89 .",
    "the equation for @xmath90 can also be derived to give @xmath91 for the qsd unraveling @xmath83 , the two equations ( [ eqqcorr1 ] ) and ( [ eqqcorr2 ] ) are known to describe the localization of the state @xmath7 towards a coherent state in the case of a harmonic oscillator .",
    "furthermore , this localization is known to be globally stable @xcite .",
    "taking the ensemble mean over equation ( [ eqqcorr1 ] ) removes the noise terms but introduces statistical correlations since the statistical mean of a product is in general different from the product of the statistical means .",
    "thus one can not obtain an immediate result for the mean rate of localization .",
    "however , one can notice that the drift part of @xmath92 can be written as a sum of positive terms : @xmath93 the third term of this expression being positive since @xmath94 .",
    "as a consequence , the argument for global stability of coherent states , @xmath95 is valid for all the continuous unravelings .",
    "a localization rate of @xmath96 , associated with the exponential decay of quantum correlations @xmath97 , is expected to be independent of the choice of unraveling .",
    "this result shows that , for an annihilation operator , all unravelings localize and @xmath96 provides a minimal bound , independent of the unraveling , for the ensemble mean localization rate .    for a hermitian operator , the unraveling which localizes the most was easy to find since",
    "the evolution of the quantum mean square deviation is not coupled to any other moment .",
    "furthermore the correlation factor @xmath75 factorises , making the unraveling independent of the state . in the present case",
    "the situation is more complex , since none of these two simplifying conditions are satisfied . in the case of an annihilation operator ,",
    "we adopt the following technique . instead of considering the localization of an arbitrary state @xmath7 , we restrict our attention to squeezed states .",
    "we will show that every unraveling ( [ eqstate1l ] ) with @xmath98 preserves the set of squeezed states , i.e. , if the initial state is a squeezed state it will evolve into a squeezed state .",
    "this has been shown for the qsd unraveling in ref .",
    "the unraveling which reduces the squeezing most efficiently is determined .",
    "finally , some arguments will be given as to why this unraveling should be the one with the highest localization rate for an arbitrary initial state .",
    "squeezed states are defined as the states @xmath99 which satisfy the relation @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are complex numbers which label the squeezed state @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "when the squeezing parameter @xmath103 vanishes , squeezed states reduce to coherent states . amongst the properties of squeezed states",
    ", we will use for our present purposes only the relations between the mean square deviation and the squeezing parameter @xmath104 where the index @xmath105 specifies that the mean square deviation is taken with respect to the squeezed state @xmath99 .",
    "this last relation tells us that the mean square deviation depends only on the squeezing parameter .",
    "a condition to check if squeezed states are preserved can be obtained by differentiating ( [ eqdefss ] ) @xcite . in order to simplify the calculation ,",
    "the stratonovich formalism is used . in this formalism , the usual differentiation rules apply .",
    "thus from ( [ eqdefss ] ) , a state @xmath7 initially squeezed will remain squeezed if it is possible to write @xmath106 where @xmath6 is to be expressed in stratonovich form . from equation ( [ eqstate1l ] ) and using the usual conversion formula @xmath107 between the stratonovich and it formalism @xcite , one can express the differential increment for the state vector @xmath7 as @xmath108 inserting this expression in the condition ( [ eqcondss ] ) , one finds not only that squeezed states are preserved but also the equations for the squeezing parameters are @xmath109 written in it form . since the evolution of the squeezing parameter @xmath101 is deterministic , it is easy to find the unraveling which produces the fastest squeezing decay .",
    "it is given by the following correlation factor @xmath110 notice that this unraveling depends on the state itself . in order to produce",
    "the maximal decay in squeezing , the noise term in the stochastic schrdinger equation has to evolve according to the prescription given in ( [ eqbestsqueezed ] ) .",
    "for such an unraveling , the norm of the correlation factor @xmath75 is kept constant at its maximal value @xmath111 and the phase varied in time along each single trajectory in order to minimize the squeezing .",
    "for all the unravelings with a correlation factor having such phase but an arbitrary norm @xmath112\\}$ ] , the localization rate can be easily computed .",
    "this set includes qsd which as @xmath113 and the adaptive unraveling ( [ eqbestsqueezed ] ) which has @xmath114 . for every unraveling in this set",
    ", the squeezing parameter @xmath101 decays as @xmath115 for large enough times . using the relation ( [ eqmsdss ] ) , one obtains @xmath116 compared to the minimal localization rate of @xmath96 , this result shows that the unravelings which have a correlation factor @xmath75 with the proper phase , i.e. all unravelings in the above mentioned set , produce a localization rate on squeezed states which is twice the minimal localization rate .",
    "furthermore , the quantum mean square deviation @xmath117 decays at the same rate as the energy .",
    "thus , the time needed for a squeezed state to become a coherent state is of the same order as the dissipation time , making the squeezed state a favourite basis for numerical simulations .",
    "squeezed states are frequently represented in phase space using distribution functions .",
    "the @xmath118 distribution of a squeezed state is a gaussian whose contour forms an ellipse .",
    "it can be easily seen that the phase ( [ eqbestsqueezed ] ) of the correlation factor @xmath75 is equal to @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the angle between the real axis and the major axis of the ellipse .",
    "the correlation factor @xmath75 is defined , irrespective of its norm , as the square of the noise term @xmath74 ( see ( [ eqnoise2 ] ) ) .",
    "thus the phase of the noise term @xmath74 , which produces the fastest squeezing decay , is the same as the phase of the major axis of the ellipse , this later being defined as @xmath121 .",
    "one can say that the unraveling varies in time in order to distribute the noise fluctuations along the axis of largest spread of the squeezed state .",
    "if the system state is not a squeezed state , the previous derivation does not apply anymore .",
    "nevertheless , we can try to generalize the result for an arbitrary state . using the relation ( [ eqmsdss ] ) between squeezing parameter and",
    "mean quantum deviation , the same unraveling can be specified as @xmath122 this expression allows us to generalize the criteria obtained for a squeezed state to an arbitrary state .",
    "this choice corresponds to fluctuations distributed along the major axis of the ellipse which will give the best approximation to the state distribution in phase space .",
    "another interesting aspect of the unraveling ( [ eqnewunravel ] ) is that it is also the one which maximizes the drift term ( [ eqdrift ] ) in the @xmath92 equation .",
    "this is not a sufficient condition to insure this unraveling localizes the most since this condition neglects statistical correlations .",
    "as soon as statistical correlations can be neglected , this unraveling will produce the highest localization rate .",
    "these two arguments show that for distributions which can be well approximated by ellipses , the unraveling ( [ eqbestsqueezed ] ) will give the highest localization rate . what happens with other states ?",
    "to answer this question , numerical simulations have been employed . using three different initial states , and three different unravelings ,",
    "the evolution in time of the quantum mean square deviation @xmath123 has been computed .",
    "the ensemble average @xmath124 taken over 1000 trajectories is represented in figures [ fig1]-[fig3 ] .",
    "the initial states chosen are : a fock state @xmath125 , a superposition of fock states @xmath126 and a superposition of coherent states @xmath127 with @xmath128 .",
    "the unravelings chosen are : the unraveling with the proper phase ( [ eqnewunravel ] ) , qsd with @xmath83 and real noise with @xmath84 .",
    "all our simulations confirm that such quantum states are very unstable under the effect of dissipation @xcite , this being independent of the chosen unraveling .",
    "after a small time @xmath129 , the state becomes a squeezed state to a very good approximation . during the transition from an arbitrary initial state to an almost squeezed state , the rate of localization is very high .",
    "once the state has become a squeezed state , the mean rate of localization is approximately constant for all the unravelings .",
    "the localization rate always lies in between the minimal rate @xmath96 and the squeezed state rate @xmath130 ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "the latter occurs only for the set of unravelings with the appropriate phase . for the unravelings with a different choice of phase , the term @xmath131 in equation ( [ eqsqueezing ] ) will give a negative contribution and produce a lower localization rate",
    "in all numerical simulations , the new unraveling produced the highest localization .",
    "finally , one can try to generalize the previous result to an arbitrary lindblad operator . in this case , the unraveling which localize the most will be the one with a correlation factor given by @xmath132 for a hermitian operator @xmath133 , this expression reproduces the result previously obtained , namely @xmath134 for the real noise unraveling .",
    "for the annihilation operator @xmath135 equation ( [ equnravel ] ) is equivalent to ( [ eqnewunravel ] ) .      instead of trying to justify further the unraveling ( [ equnravel ] )",
    "as the most localizing one for an arbitrary lindblad operator we look for an estimate of the improvement produced by using such an unraveling in numerical simulations .",
    "the test consists of computing the quantum mean square deviation @xmath123 along a quantum trajectory with both the unraveling ( [ eqnewunravel ] ) and the qsd unraveling . the ensemble average @xmath124 which gives a measure of the size of the wave packet as well as the variance @xmath136 which measures the fluctuations of the wave packet size are then compared between the two unravelings . the quantity @xmath123 is taken here as a measure of the size of the wave packet since it corresponds formally to the excitation number of the state displaced at the origin @xcite . for a number states basis , this measure is proportional to the number of basis state needed to represent the state @xmath7 .",
    "the system we used for this test is a kicked anharmonic oscillator @xmath137 subject to dissipation @xmath98 .",
    "the driving @xmath138 is a periodic sequence of rectangular pulses of height @xmath139 , length @xmath140 and separation @xmath141 . in this case",
    "the hamiltonian can also play an important role in the localization process .",
    "this system has been considered in previous publications @xcite as a simple example of a chaotic system . in conjunction with this system ,",
    "the scaling transformations : @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 have been introduced .",
    "this scaling of the parameters does not affect the classical dynamics but when it is introduced in the quantum equations of motion , it allows one to perform the quantum - classical transition , by varying @xmath146 from @xmath147 ( quantum ) to @xmath148 ( classical ) .",
    "here we use this transformation for a different purpose . in the quantum limit ,",
    "nonlinear effects produce a strong delocalization which can not be compensated by the localization effect of the dissipation . in the classical limit , on the contrary",
    ", localization is expected to be dominant .",
    "thus varying the scaling factor allows us to tune the relative strength of the delocalization .    in figure [ fig5 ]",
    ", the ensemble average and variance of the quantum square deviation @xmath123 are represented for different values of the scaling parameter @xmath146 .",
    "the values represented are stationary results obtained by integrating the equations of motions over typically 2500 periods and taking the mean over a single trajectory .",
    "such a long integration in time is necessary in order to obtain a proper average over the strange attractor of the chaotic system .",
    "the system parameters are set to the following values @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath153 for which the classical system is known to be chaotic .",
    "the precision of the numerical results is estimated by repeating the calculations for different numerical parameters such as the time step size .",
    "figure [ fig5](a ) shows for both unravelings a slowly decaying ensemble average @xmath124 for an increasing value of the scaling @xmath146 .",
    "notice that the amplitude of motion rescales as @xmath146 thus the ratio @xmath154 tends towards zero when @xmath155 , providing a numerical justification for the emergence of the classical attractor .",
    "furthermore , fig [ fig5](a ) shows that the unraveling ( [ eqnewunravel ] ) reduces , compared to the qsd unraveling , the stationary value of the mean size of the wave packet",
    ". the reduction can be up to 20% depending on the scale parameter @xmath146 , the largest reduction being achieved in the quantum regime .",
    "more important is the reduction of the size of the fluctuations shown in fig [ fig5](b ) .",
    "the picture suggested is that each time the wave packet deviates from a coherent state the qsd unraveling tends to restore the shape by applying a homogeneous noise , while the unraveling ( [ eqnewunravel ] ) adapts by applying a non - homogeneous noise in the direction of the largest deviation .",
    "this adaptability does not produce an important reduction of the wave packet size but can stabilize the wave packet more efficiently as compared to qsd .",
    "we have introduced the set of continuous unravelings which recovers in mean the master equation in lindblad form and preserves the norm of the state vector .",
    "the quantum state diffusion unraveling is a member of this set , being the simplest which preserves the same invariance properties under unitary transformations as the density matrix .",
    "we have seen that each single unraveling can be specified very simply by the choice of the noise correlations thus providing a natural classification . for theoretical purposes , it is useful to work with the full set of continuous unravelings since it allows one to study how quantities which depend on the choice of the unraveling are sensitive to this choice .    as a first application , we have studied the localization properties when only a single lindblad operator is present . in the case of a hermitian operator ,",
    "the highest localization rate of the real noise unraveling as well as the absence of localization of the imaginary noise unraveling have been recovered and explained in a consistent way . for a non hermitian operator , namely the annihilation operator , a new time dependent unraveling has been introduced .",
    "it is shown analytically that this unraveling provides the highest localization rate for squeezed states and numerically that this property is also valid for more complex quantum states .",
    "this unraveling maximizes the localization by continuously adjusting the phase noise according to the shape of the wave packet .",
    "this study provides a better understanding of the localization .",
    "for instance , the qsd unraveling is known to have good localization properties due to its invariance corresponding , in some sense , to a homogeneous distribution of noise .",
    "we have seen that the localization rate can be increased by maximizing the norm of the noise correlation factor and adjusting continuously its phase , this last constraint leading to the introduction of a time dependent unraveling .    since the new unraveling increases localization it is a good candidate for numerical simulations of quantum trajectories and for the solution of the master equation .",
    "a numerical comparison of the wave packet size and fluctuations between qsd and the new unraveling shows that the new unraveling performs better than qsd by stabilizing the size of the wave packet .    in connection with the study of the quantum - classical transition , a recent work by brun",
    "@xcite has shown that the quantum jump unraveling tends to a continuous unraveling .",
    "it can be easily seen that this unraveling is a member of the set introduced in the present paper .",
    "we have shown that for a simple quantum system subject to dissipation all members of the set of continuous unravelings localize with a minimal rate given by the dissipation rate , making localization a general property valid for all unravelings instead of only some particular ones .",
    "we thank gernot alber , nicolas gisin , ian percival , rdiger schack and walter strunz for stimulating discussions .",
    "we acknowledge financial support from the eu under its human capital and mobility programme .",
    "in the case of a linear combination of two wiener process @xmath46 , the noise term @xmath74 is specified by the two complex numbers @xmath156 and @xmath157 which we write as @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "the noise correlation factor becomes @xmath160 using @xmath161 and @xmath162 , this complex number can be rewritten as @xmath163 if @xmath164 and @xmath165 are kept constant and @xmath166 is varied , the denominator will give a circle in the complex plane , centered at ( 1,0 ) and of radius @xmath167 .",
    "the denominator will restrict the circle to be inside the unit disk , centered at the origin .",
    "the phase @xmath168 produces only a rotation around the origin .",
    "thus the number @xmath75 can take any value inside the unit circle only : @xmath94 .",
    "furthermore , this result can be generalized without difficulty for an arbitrary number @xmath169 of noise terms .",
