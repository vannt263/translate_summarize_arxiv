    "despite considerable efforts devoted to the study of superconducting pairing mechanism in the new feas - based high-@xmath2  superconductors ( hts s ) its physical nature still remains uncertain .",
    "however , there is a growing evidence that it is of presumably magnetic type and all members of the iron arsenide @xmath6feaso@xmath7f@xmath8  family , where @xmath6  is a lanthanide , are characterized by the long - range ( non - local ) magnetic correlations @xcite .",
    "it is well known that upon electron or hole doping with f substitution at the o site @xcite , or with oxygen vacancies @xcite all properties of parent @xmath6feaso compounds drastically change and evident antiferromagnetic ( _ afm _ ) order has to disappear @xcite .",
    "however , the comparison with the present smfeaso@xmath7  superconductors points towards an important role of low - energy spin fluctuations .",
    "they emerge on doping away from the antiferromagnetic state which is of spin - density wave ( sdw ) type @xcite .",
    "thus , below @xmath9 150  k the _ afm _ fluctuations , being likely of spin wave type , are believed to noticeably affect the properties of @xmath6feaso@xmath7f@xmath8systems @xcite . as shown by many studies",
    "@xcite the static magnetism persists well into the superconducting regime of ferropnictides . besides",
    ", it was recently shown theoretically that antiferromagnetism and superconductivity can coexist in these materials only if cooper pairs form an unconventional , sign - changing state @xcite .    in smfeaso@xmath7  strongly disordered but static magnetism and superconductivity both",
    "are found to exist in the wide range of doping , and prominent low - energy spin fluctuations are observed up to the highest achievable doping levels where @xmath2  is maximal @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the muon asymmetry @xcite demonstrates that the coexistence of magnetism and superconductivity must be nanoscopic , i.e. , the two phases must be finely interspersed over a typical length scale of few nm .",
    "recently reported results on peculiar magnetic properties of lafeaso@xmath1f@xmath10  at @xmath11 135  k @xcite are likely due to this two - phase structure .",
    "the relation between the sdw and superconducting order is a central topic in the current research on the feas - based high-@xmath2  superconductors .",
    "however , the clear nature of the complex interplay between magnetism and superconductivity in feas - based hts s is still rather controversial . as a result ,",
    "rather complicated phase diagrams for different feas - based high-@xmath2  systems @xcite and especially for smfeaso@xmath7  @xcite are reported .",
    "for all these hts s rather wide temperature region is found in which the superconductivity coexists with sdw regime . for smfeaso@xmath7  in a zero magnetic field this temperature region ranges from approximately @xmath12 = 0.1 up to @xmath12 = 0.18 @xcite . as a result , rather peculiar normal state behavior of the system upon t diminution is expected in this case @xcite when @xmath12 is , let s say , 0.15 , as it is in our sample @xcite .    to shed more light on the problem in our previous study @xcite the fluctuation conductivity ( flc ) and @xmath3 , referred to as the pseudogap ( pg ) , derived from resistivity measurements on smfeaso@xmath1  polycrystal with @xmath13 55 k were analyzed . as expected , the temperature behavior of flc was found to be rather similar to that observed for ybco films with nearly optimal oxygen doping @xcite , whereas @xmath3  has demonstrated several peculiar features @xcite . in this contribution",
    "we venture to explain found @xmath3  peculiarities in terms of machida - nokura - matsubara ( mnm ) @xcite theory developed for _ afm _ superconductors as well as to compare the results with babaev - kleinert ( bk ) theory @xcite considering superconductors with different charge carrier density @xmath14 .",
    "to begin with the pseudogap analysis at first the flc in smfeaso@xmath1  polycrystal with @xmath13 55  k has been thoroughly analyzed @xcite .",
    "the flc is a part of a common excess conductivity @xmath15  which is usually written as @xmath16\\,/\\,[\\rho_n(t ) \\cdot \\rho(t ) ] .",

    "the common excess conductivity @xmath22  as a function of the reduced temperature which is defined as @xmath23  is plotted in fig .  3 and 4 ( see ref .",

    "the result suggests the interband pairing mechanism as a dominant one in smfeaso@xmath1 , as it was theoretically discussed in ref .",
    "it should be also noted that in the hl theory only the maki - thompson ( mt ) fluctuation contribution was used @xcite .",
    "the mt - al ( 2d-3d ) crossover is distinctly seen in the @xmath22  dependence as t approaches @xmath2  @xcite .",

    "the coherence length @xmath29  is an important parameter of the pg analysis @xcite .      to analyze pg",
    "we assume that the excess conductivity @xmath22  at the temperatures @xmath30  arises as a result of the paired fermions organization in the form of the local pairs ( strongly bound bosons ( sbb ) ) @xcite which satisfy the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) theory @xcite . upon temperature decrease",

    "<S> we report the analysis of pseudogap @xmath0 derived from resistivity experiments in feas - based superconductor smfeaso@xmath1 , having a critical temperature @xmath2 = 55  k. rather specific dependence @xmath3  with two representative temperatures followed by a minimum at about 120  k was observed . below @xmath4 147  k , </S>",
    "<S> corresponding to the structural transition in smfeaso , @xmath3  decreases linearly down to the temperature @xmath5 133  k. this last peculiarity can likely be attributed to the antiferromagnetic ( _ afm _ ) ordering of fe spins . </S>",
    "<S> it is believed that the found behavior can be explained in terms of machida , nokura , and matsubara ( mnm ) theory developed for the afm superconductors . </S>"
