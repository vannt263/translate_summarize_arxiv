    "ultracold atoms on atom chips are key to new atom - based technologies such as interferometers and precision sensors and provide access to fundamental aspects of many - body physics , atom - surface interactions , quantum metrology and quantum information science  @xcite . so far experiments have dealt with atoms prepared in the electronic ground state , due to their intrinsic stability . despite their weak interactions , ground - state atoms on atom chips have been used to sensitively probe the intrinsic thermal noise near surfaces  @xcite , map magnetic and electric field distributions  @xcite , and investigate the casimir - polder potential in the micrometer range  @xcite .",
    "comparatively , atoms excited to high - lying rydberg states have extremely large transition dipole moments ( scaling with @xmath1 ) resulting in long - range interactions and have large electric polarizabilities ( @xmath2 ) which can greatly enhance both atom - atom and atom - surface interactions .",
    "recent experiments with rydberg atoms have largely been motivated by the excitation blockade mechanism  @xcite .",
    "this made possible the experimental demonstration of a two - qubit quantum gate and entanglement between neutral atoms in separate microtraps  @xcite .",
    "interactions can be further enhanced and controlled in the presence of modest electric fields via frster resonances  @xcite over distances of tens of micrometers  @xcite .",
    "we aim to employ rydberg blockade to optically control interactions between atomic ensembles prepared in separate magnetic microtraps on a magnetic lattice atom chip  @xcite . here , an unknown factor is the influence of the nearby metallic surface on the lifetime and coherence properties of the excited rydberg atoms .    in this paper",
    "we report the coherent excitation of rydberg atoms on an atom chip@xcite .",
    "to probe the atom - surface potential and lifetime of the rydberg states we employ excited - state electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit )  @xcite .",
    "the position and width of the narrow transmission resonance reflect the energy and lifetime of the rydberg state and provide a sensitive probe of the atom - surface interaction .",
    "this is related to a recent experiment investigating rydberg excitation in a room temperature glass vapour cell at very small distances to the walls  @xcite .",
    "here we investigate the effects of a metallic atom - chip surface with ultracold rydberg atoms and with much higher energy resolution .",
    "electromagnetically induced transparency is a coherent interference effect where the absorption on a resonant transition between two states is strongly modified by a coupling to a third state , creating a narrow transparency window .",
    "a common eit configuration  @xcite is the ladder - type system investigated here .",
    "we probe the absorption on the @xmath3-@xmath4 transition of @xmath5rb , with the @xmath4-state strongly coupled with a resonant laser to a highly excited @xmath6 or @xmath7 rydberg state , as is depicted in figure [ fig : setup]a .    , additional decay channels lead to a broadening of the rydberg transition , i.e. an increase in @xmath8 .",
    "( b ) schematic picture of the experimental setup .",
    "probe beam , coupling beam and the imaging system are depicted .",
    "( c ) typical absorption image taken on the @xmath9 transition .",
    "the chip is located at the top of the figure .",
    "the induced transparency due to the coupling laser is visible around @xmath10  . ]    in this experiment the coupling laser is frequency stabilized directly to the @xmath11-transition such that the transparency window is near the center of the resonance . in the limit of low probe intensity",
    "the susceptibility is given by @xmath12 where the probe absorption is proportional to the imaginary part im@xmath13  @xcite .",
    "in this equation @xmath14 and @xmath8 denote the decay rates of the probe- and coupling resonances respectively , @xmath15 and @xmath16 the detunings and @xmath17 the rabi frequency of the upper transition ( fig .",
    "[ fig : setup]a ) .",
    "if the rydberg energy level shifts due to atom - atom or atom - surface interaction this leads to a detuning of the coupling laser from resonance which is visible as a shift of the transparency window in the absorption profile by a frequency @xmath16 . furthermore , if the lifetime of the rydberg state decreases , e.g. through induced decay to neighbouring states , this leads to a broadening of the transparency window , visible as an increase of @xmath8 .",
    "excited - state eit is thus a sensitive probe to measure interactions in a rydberg state .",
    "we trap approximately @xmath18 @xmath5rb @xmath19 atoms in a magnetic ioffe - pritchard type trap .",
    "the magnetic field required for this trap is produced by a z - shape wire beneath the atom chip surface .",
    "the surface is coated with a gold layer and electrically isolated from the rest of the chip .",
    "the chip also features a permanent - magnet fept layer that has been used to create arrays of microtraps  @xcite , but this does not significantly influence the experiments discussed here .",
    "the atoms are cooled to temperatures of a few  by forced evaporative cooling .",
    "this setup is described in detail in  @xcite .",
    "prior to detection , the atoms are released from the trap and expand freely for in a uniform magnetic field of parallel to the probe beam .",
    "typical peak atomic densities are @xmath20 . after expansion",
    "the vertical extension of the cloud is and the cloud center is from the surface ( see figure [ fig : setup]c ) .",
    "the expanded cloud minimizes possible effects of atom - atom interactions and allows simultaneous probing of many atom - surface distances .",
    "we measure eit spectra by simultaneously pulsing on a circularly polarized probe and a counterpropagating linearly - polarized ( perpendicular to the chip surface ) coupling laser beam for and recording an absorption image of the probe with a ccd camera for a variable detuning @xmath15 .",
    "the resolution of our imaging system is @xmath0  .",
    "the probe beam is approximately uniform and much larger than the atom cloud , whereas the counterpropagating coupling laser beam is passed through an aperture and is imaged onto the atoms .",
    "the width of the coupling beam is @xmath0   and it extends @xmath0   from the chip surface ; significantly smaller than the size of the atom cloud , i.e. only part of the cloud is exposed to the coupling beam and thus rendered transparent .",
    "this situation is depicted in figure [ fig : setup]b ) , and the spatial extent of the coupling beam is clearly visible as a light region ( low optical density ) centered around @xmath10  , @xmath21   in figure [ fig : setup]c .",
    "the probe laser is frequency - stabilized directly to the @xmath22 transition using doppler - free polarization spectroscopy in a vapour cell .",
    "we estimate the linewidth of the laser around @xmath0   by beating it against an identical laser . to measure absorption spectra it is frequency shifted using a pair of double - pass aoms which allow detunings between @xmath23  .",
    "the coupling beam is produced by a frequency - doubled cw diode laser ( toptica ta - shg ) .",
    "it is directly locked to the rydberg state of interest by vapour cell eit as described in  @xcite .",
    "this allows direct stable locking to both s- and d- rydberg states in the range n = 19  70 ; the fine structure of the d - states is also well resolved in the spectroscopy .",
    "we estimate the combined ( two - photon ) linewidth of the rydberg excitation lasers to be between 0.5 and , depending on the rydberg state used .",
    "we extract spectra from a series of absorption images such as the one shown in figure [ fig : setup]c ) . by analyzing a series of such images taken for different detunings of the probe laser",
    "we construct an absorption spectrum as a function of detuning and distance to the surface .",
    "the coupling laser remains fixed in both position and frequency .",
    "for each detuning we take one image with the coupling laser present , and a reference image without the coupling laser . by analyzing each pixel of these images",
    "separately we obtain spatially resolved information about the transparency of the sample . in particular , this allows us to extract information for a large number of distances from the surface of the atom chip at once .",
    "the dashed line in figure [ fig : setup]c ) denotes the peak eit signal and is used to extract eit spectra at different distances to the chip .",
    "a small angle between the beam profile and the surface normal helps to align the coupling beam parallel to the surface and minimize fringing .",
    "rydberg state .",
    "square points indicate the measured optical density spectrum taken in the absence of the coupling laser , with a fit to eq .   with @xmath24 (",
    "dashed line ) .",
    "circles correspond to the eit spectrum with the solid line a fit to the data using eq .",
    "[ eqn : eitmodel ] .",
    "both spectra are obtained at a distance of @xmath0   from the surface of the chip . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : spectrum ] shows an absorption spectrum measured in the absence of the coupling beam ( square points ) , along with a spectrum measured with the coupling beam present ( circles ) , for a relatively large atom - surface distance of @xmath25  .",
    "the former simply reflects the natural absorption lineshape of the @xmath5rb @xmath26 transition and is used as a reference .",
    "the latter spectrum shows the eit dip resulting from strong coupling to the @xmath27 rydberg state .",
    "the transparency window is close to the center of the @xmath26 resonance .",
    "we can extract relevant parameters , in particular the linewidth and the detuning of the rydberg state from these measurements by fitting the model of equation .",
    "for the spectrum of figure  [ fig : spectrum ] we find @xmath28   and @xmath29  .",
    "the narrowest spectrum we have observed had a linewidth of for the state 23s@xmath30 at a distance of from the chip , consistent with our estimates for the combined laser linewidth .",
    "the non - zero fitted value of @xmath16 is due to a small offset in the locking of the probe- and coupling lasers , and constitutes a constant offset which is subtracted in later analysis .",
    "the measured eit spectra demonstrate the coherent excitation of rydberg atoms on an atom chip , in the distance range relevant to typical atom chip experiments .",
    "the width of the resonance is currently determined by the linewidth of the excitation laser system .",
    "figure  [ fig : detuning ] shows the fitted detuning of the eit resonances as a function of distance to the surface for various excited states in the range @xmath31 .",
    "example spectra with fits for some observed level shifts are shown in figure  [ fig : detuning](a , b ) for the state 36d@xmath32 and in figure  [ fig : detuning](c ) for the state 23s@xmath30 .",
    "the dashed vertical line indicates the extrapolated position of the eit resonance for large distances ( subtracted in fig .",
    "[ fig : detuning]d ) ; a significant distance - dependent shift of the fitted resonance position is clearly recognizable .",
    "a positive shift of the detuning is equivalent to a shift of the rydberg level towards higher energies .",
    "we investigate s - states @xmath33 as well as d - states where @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the distance range probed in the experiments is between and and in this range we observe shifts between and .",
    "the measured @xmath36 dependence is @xmath37 , however there are significant differences between measured shifts for @xmath38 , d@xmath39 and d@xmath32 states .    .",
    "the vertical lines in these figures denote the resonance position at large distances .",
    "the main figure ( d ) shows measured shifts of the eit resonance for various excited states as a function of distance from the surface .",
    "the measurement of 27d@xmath32 indicates typical error bars ( standard deviation ) calculated from repeated measurements of the same state over a time - span of 3 weeks .",
    "the lower panel ( e ) shows fitted values for @xmath8 for all states presented . ]",
    "notably , the measured shifts for the d@xmath32 states have the opposite sign as compared with the s@xmath30 and d@xmath39 states .",
    "this we attribute to the differing dc electric polarizability @xmath40 for the studied states indicating the shifts originate from spatially varying electric fields .",
    "we compute @xmath40 from perturbation theory based on the analytical radial matrix elements in terms of appell f@xmath41 functions , including their dependence on @xmath42 and @xmath43 quantum numbers  @xcite , using precise values for the @xmath5rb quantum defects  @xcite .",
    "the calculated values are in excellent agreement with tabulated measurements for the scalar and tensor polarizabilities from previous stark shift measurements of @xmath38 and @xmath44-states of @xmath45rb  @xcite .",
    "in particular we find that for nd@xmath46 , @xmath40 is negative for the measured states , whereas the @xmath38 and d@xmath47 states have a positive sign . from the measured shifts",
    "we conclude that the dominant states probed in these experiments are s@xmath48 , d@xmath49 and d@xmath50 .",
    "the other @xmath43 states are expected to shift at a different range of distances than those investigated , and could have an influence for larger distances .",
    "for example , for the state 22d@xmath32 the electric polarizability @xmath40 for @xmath51 and @xmath52 is about 3 and 10 times larger respectively than for the probed state @xmath53 .",
    "the spectra also provide information on the rydberg lifetime through the parameter @xmath8 .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : detuning](e ) the fitted values of @xmath8 do not measurably depend on the distance to the chip surface .",
    "the observed linewidths are of the order of the linewidth measured at large distances to the chip , which is limited by the linewidth of our laser system ( see figure [ fig : spectrum]a ) .",
    "for some of the data we see evidence for other @xmath43 states as double eit resonances , which may result in artificially large fitted values for @xmath8 .",
    "some broadening of the eit resonances ( @xmath54 ) is also expected due to integration over the inhomogeneous electric field over the atomic distribution along the probe axis during imaging .",
    "the largest fitted value for @xmath8 we observed in any measurement was below , giving a lower bound for the rydberg lifetime of .",
    "@xmath55 , and radius @xmath56  , averaged over the @xmath57 cloud radius of @xmath58  .",
    "the dotted line indicates the peak field strength at the center of the atom cloud ( @xmath59 ) . ]    shown in figure  [ fig : field ] are values for the local electric field strength @xmath60 inferred from the measured rydberg energy - level shifts .",
    "the measurements are identical to those presented in figure [ fig : detuning ] ; they span from @xmath61 and include @xmath38 , d@xmath39 and d@xmath32 angular momentum states covering a wide range of electric polarizabilities . in this form ,",
    "all data fall on a single curve , confirming that the measured line shifts are caused by an inhomogeneous electric field originating from the chip surface .",
    "the height dependence of the field strength roughly follows a weak power - law decay @xmath62 , thus excluding effects due to van der waals interactions ( @xmath63 )  @xcite or randomly distributed patch potentials expected to scale with @xmath64 .",
    "we also expect a contribution of the van der waals interaction for e.g. 26s of only @xmath0   at .",
    "the presented data was obtained over a time - span of approximately 4 weeks of experiments , indicating the observed electric field is relatively stable and reproducible from day - to - day .",
    "we account for our measurements by assuming the electric field is produced by a patch of rb adsorbates deposited on the chip surface .",
    "following  @xcite , we treat each adsorbate as an electric dipole oriented perpendicular to the chip surface and assume a patch of adsorbates which reflects the gaussian distribution of atoms released from the magnetic trap . integrating the field over the distribution of dipoles gives the total electric field as a function of distance from the surface . at the center of the patch the field is given by @xmath65 $ ] where @xmath66 , @xmath67 is the peak dipole density and @xmath68 is the @xmath57 patch radius .",
    "finally , we include averaging of the measured line shifts over the width of the atom cloud @xmath58   ( along the probe axis at the time of detection ) .",
    "this model is then fit to the data by least squares minimization as a function of @xmath69 to extract the dipole density and patch size .",
    "the solid - line in fig .",
    "[ fig : field ] shows the result of a fit to the entire data set .",
    "the fit parameters are a peak dipole density @xmath70   and a patch size @xmath56  , which is comparable to the radius of the atom cloud after expansion and the distance at which the trapped cloud is released .",
    "the dashed - line indicates the inferred field strength at the center of the cloud which is roughly 20% larger than the cloud averaged field strength .    from the fit results and for a dipole moment of order  @xcite",
    "we estimate a total of @xmath71 adsorbates on the surface .",
    "assuming at steady state a decay rate of the order of @xmath72 ( room temperature surface  @xcite ) and an experimental cycle time of , this corresponds to @xmath73 deposited atoms per shot , comparable to the number of atoms released in each run of the experiment ( @xmath74 ) . since these measurements",
    ", we have attempted to clean the surface of adsorbates by resistively heating the z - shaped wire beneath the chip surface ( @xmath75  , conductor temperature @xmath76  ) for 48 hours , however this was insufficient to significantly raise the surface temperature and did not have an appreciable effect on the measured rydberg lineshifts .",
    "briefly exposing the surface to oxygen may be a better method to elimate the electric field produced by rubidium adsorbates .",
    "the present experiments focus on spatially resolved excitation of rydberg atoms on an atom chip .",
    "we create rydberg atoms in a cloud of rubidium atoms on an atom chip , and investigate electromagnetically induced transparency near the chip surface .",
    "absorption imaging in conjunction with the recording of eit signals is used to obtain spatially resolved eit spectra .",
    "we measure significant shifts of the rydberg levels as we approach the surface which we attribute to electric fields produced by adatoms adsorbed on the chip surface .",
    "a theoretical model of the field produced by a gaussian distribution of surface dipoles is in good agreement with our data .",
    "we do not observe significant broadening of the rydberg levels .",
    "the measured shifts are not expected to inhibit the coherent creation and investigation of rydberg atoms on atom chips .",
    "we clearly see that the shifts are directly proportional to the polarizabilities of the states in question .",
    "this opens new possibilities to use rydberg excited atoms as a sensitive , spatially resolved probe of electric fields  @xcite .",
    "a simple estimate of our present sensitivity to electric fields is @xmath0   with a resolution",
    ". the field sensitivity could be straight forwardly improved using narrow linewidth lasers and higher - lying rydberg states .",
    "the surface effects due to adatoms observed here could be prevented in future experiments by incorporating a magnetic field gradient to push the atoms away from the surface at the end of each experimental cycle .",
    "furthermore , use of other coating materials on the chip surface could decrease the dipole moment of adatoms , or increase the desorption rate of these atoms .",
    "highly excited rydberg atoms on atom chips , as demonstrated here for the first time , open new avenues for the study of dipolar physics , strongly interacting systems , and quantum information science in tailored trapping potentials .",
    "atom chips allow the preparation of small atomic clouds  @xcite ideal for investigating dipole - dipole interactions and collective excitations in dense ( ) mesoscopic ensembles  @xcite . furthermore , rydberg atoms on atom chips are very attractive for studying long - range van der waals interactions with surfaces  @xcite and interfacing ultracold atoms with on - chip structures  @xcite .",
