    "many optical phenomena like refraction and dispersion involve a change in the trajectory of the incident light as a consequence of the spatial variation of the refractive index of the medium . in the past decades",
    ", optical beam deflection has achieved a considerable attention .",
    "the deflection of light beam can be achieved by mechanical interaction @xcite , thermal gradient @xcite , acousto - optical interaction @xcite , electro - optic effect @xcite and all - optical methods @xcite .",
    "optical methods have enjoyed much attention due to their high speed , efficiency and fast nonlinear response time .",
    "manoeuvering light by another light through their interaction with the medium has thus created a new avenue of research .",
    "much interest has been given to the deflection of light beam in a homogeneous medium subjected to external fields with spatially inhomogeneous intensity distributions .",
    "the spatial modulation of the refractive index of the medium induced by a suitable inhomogeneous control field leads to several effects such as dynamic light deflection @xcite , waveguiding @xcite , and antiwaveguiding @xcite .",
    "a significant variation of the refractive index at resonance can give rise to lage deflection .",
    "recently , such a deflection in an atomic medium , exhibiting electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) , is observed in presence of a _ magnetic field _ with small gradient transverse to the propagation direction @xcite . in another related experiment @xcite , it is found that the light ray can also be deflected when an _ optical field _ with inhomogeneous transverse profile drives a cell with rb atomic vapors with @xmath0-type energy - level configuration .",
    "the angle of deviation obtained by means of optical field is found to be much larger ( by several order ) than that reported using inhomogeneous magnetic field @xcite .",
    "an adequate explanation for the observed phenomenon of light deflection can be provided in the framework of semiclassical theory @xcite .",
    "further , the beam deflection in eit medium can also be explained quantum mechanically in terms of dark state _",
    "polariton _ possessing an effective magnetic moment @xcite .",
    "besides this , the deflection of light in terms of _ vector optical solitons _ ( nonlinear polariton ) in a double eit system is proposed in @xcite .",
    "further , in comparison to eit medium , active raman gain medium ( arg ) is shown to induce larger deflection of light beams @xcite and antiwaveguiding @xcite .    in order to measure the small deflections of beams ,",
    "many sophisticated interferometric setups have been proposed @xcite .",
    "some of these techniques are inspired by quantum _ weak measurement _",
    "@xcite to resolve angstrom - scale optical beam deflection in space as well as in time domain @xcite . in this paper , instead of making sensitive detection of small deflection , we rather propose a way to increase the angular separation between the circular components of the probe field by using an inhomogeneous control field in an atomic vapor system with tripod configuration .",
    "we present a theoretical analysis ( in the framework of _ semiclassical _ theory ) to demonstrate light deflection where the control beam is incident obliquely to the entrance face of the vapor cell .",
    "this oblique incidence of the control beam causes the mixing of the excitations on all the three optical transitions in the tripod system , leading to an extra flexibility to produce large angular divergence among @xmath1 components of the probe field by changing the angle of incidence .",
    "it should be borne in mind that a medium of chiral molecules also creates the birefringence and hence the angular divergence between the circular components of the linearly polarized light . in @xcite",
    ", it has been demonstrated that such an effect can occur at the interface of achiral and chiral media and can be used for the detection of optical activity @xcite with a _ miniaturized _ sample volume . here",
    ", we mimic such a situation in _ atomic vapors _ by exploiting large angular divergence _",
    "close to the entry face _ of the vapor cell .",
    "note that an inhomogeneous control field can create a birefringence inside a medium @xcite . by suitably choosing the transverse profile of the control field",
    ", one can enhance this birefringence to impart larger angular divergence to the orthogonal components .",
    "we show that by choosing a laguerre - gaussian profile @xcite of the control field , angular divergence can be made larger , compared to that as obtained using a gaussian profile .",
    "this also results in the focusing and refocusing effects of @xmath1 components of the probe field at various axial positions .",
    "we detect a few focal points for the probe field depending on the profile and the incidence angle of the control beam .",
    "thereby , a medium with suitable length behaves as a lens @xcite with multiple foci .",
    "it is to be emphasized that the large angular divergence of the circular components of the probe field is accompanied by zero absorption at resonance , thanks to eit @xcite .",
    "this suggests a way how to obtain sufficiently large deflection , even with an eit medium , instead of an arg medium .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the theoretical model is introduced along with the eikonal approximation for the probe deflection .",
    "the influence of the angle of incidence and the profile of control field on the deflection and the transmission of circular components of the probe field is described in sec .",

    "we describe the dynamical evolution of the system by the density matrix equations in markovian limit , as given in the appendix .      in the steady state",

    "( [ eq8 ] ) yields @xmath72 where , @xmath73 is the length of the medium in the direction of propagation . in this paper , we consider that the transverse profile of the control field is confined to the @xmath74 plane . due to the anisotropy induced by the magnetic field and the inhomogeneous control field @xcite , the refractive index @xmath75 and the corresponding angle of deflection @xmath76 of the @xmath1 components will be different , giving rise to an angular divergence @xmath77 .",

    "as the control field is incident at an angle @xmath36 to the vapor cell , we can write @xmath90 and @xmath91 as the coordinates in the plane of incidence . for @xmath92 ,",
    "the above profile becomes gaussian , and takes the following simplified form @xmath93 where , @xmath94 defines the maximum amplitude of the gaussian beam and @xmath95 refers to its transverse width .",
    "note that the full width at half maxima ( fwhm ) of the above profile is @xmath96 .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath97 corresponds to a laguerre - gaussian ( lg)@xmath98 profile with azimuthal index @xmath99 .",

    "further , the location of the focal points can be varied by changing the angle of incidence of the control field .",
    "thus , the profile of the control beam and its angle of incidence act as a knob to control the focusing and refocusing of the probe field while passing through an optically controlled atomic medium .",
    "in conclusion , we have explored the enhancement of the angular divergence between the orthogonally polarized components of the linearly polarized probe field by using angle of incidence and the profile of the control beam as a knob .",

    "<S> we study the angular deflection of the circularly polarized components of a linearly polarized probe field in a weakly birefringent atomic system in tripod configuration . </S>",
    "<S> a spatially inhomogeneous control field incident obliquely onto an atomic vapor cell facilitates a large angular divergence between circular components . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the angular resolution can be dynamically controlled by optimally choosing the angle of incidence and the transverse profile of the control beam . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , by employing a laguerre - gaussian profile of the control field , one can impart a large angular divergence to the circular components close to the entry face of the atomic vapor cell . </S>",
    "<S> we further demonstrate how such a medium causes the focusing and refocusing of the probe field , thereby acting as a lens with multiple foci . </S>",
    "<S> the absorption in the medium remains negligible at resonance due to electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) . </S>"
