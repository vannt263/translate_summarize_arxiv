    "namely , for general @xmath14 and @xmath13 there can not exist such a scheme @xmath28 .",

    "then @xmath54 and @xmath55 are elliptic curves , and @xmath0 is the blow - up of a product of two elliptic curves @xmath56 .    since @xmath53 we have that @xmath52 is a section of @xmath43 , and thus @xmath57 via @xmath43 .",
    "in particular , @xmath54 and , similarly , @xmath55 are elliptic curves .",
    "it is well known that there are no non  constant maps from a rational curve to a curve of positive genus ( @xcite , iv.2.5.4 ) .",
    "thus any exceptional curve of @xmath0 sits in some fiber .",
    "thus we can reach relatively minimal models of @xmath43 and @xmath58 by successively blowing down exceptional @xmath59-curves which belong to fibres of both @xmath43 and @xmath58 , i.e.  we have the following commutative diagram @xmath60^(.7){\\phi}\\ar@/^/[drr]^{\\pi}\\ar@/_/[ddr]_{\\pi ' } & \\\\           & s'\\ar[r]^(.4){\\widetilde{\\pi}}\\ar[d]^{\\widetilde{\\pi } ' } & e_0\\\\           & f_0 &         } \\ ] ] where @xmath61 is actually a minimal surface .",
    "since a general fibre of @xmath43 or @xmath58 is not touched by the blowing - down @xmath62 we may denote the general fibres of @xmath63 and @xmath64 again by @xmath51 respectively @xmath52 , and we still have @xmath53 .",
    "we will now try to identify the minimal surface @xmath61 in the classification of minimal surfaces .    by @xcite ex .",
    "7.9 the canonical divisor @xmath65 is numerically trivial , since @xmath61 is a minimal surface admitting two elliptic fibrations over elliptic curves .",
    "but then we can apply @xcite ex .",
    "7.7 , and since the base curve @xmath54 of the fibration @xmath63 is elliptic we see that the invariant @xmath66 of the relatively minimal fibration @xmath63 mentioned in @xcite cor .",
    "7.17 is zero , so that the same corollary implies that the fibration has at most multiple fibres with smooth reduction as singular fibres .",
    "however , since @xmath63 has a section @xmath52 there are no multiple fibres , and thus all fibres of @xmath63 are smooth .    moreover ,",
    "since the canonical divisor of @xmath61 is numerically trivial it is in particular nef , and by @xcite thm .",
    "10.5 we get that the kodaira dimension @xmath67 of @xmath61 is zero .    moreover , by @xcite cor .  7.16 the surface @xmath61 has second chern class @xmath68 , since the invariant @xmath69 as already mentioned above . thus by the enriques - kodaira classification ( see e.g. @xcite thm .",
    "10.1.1 ) @xmath61 must either be a torus or hyperelliptic ( where the latter is sometimes also called bielliptic ) .",
    "a bielliptic surface has precisely two elliptic fibrations , but one of them is a fibration over a @xmath70 and only one is over an elliptic curve ( see e.g.  @xcite thm .",
    "thus @xmath61 is not bielliptic .",
    "moreover , if @xmath61 is a torus then @xmath65 is trivial and thus so is @xmath71 , which by @xcite cor .",
    "7.21 implies that @xmath61 is a product of the base curve with a fibre .",
    "lemma [ lem : ellipticfibrations ] implies that in order to show that the situation of proposition [ prop : length4 ] can not occur , we have to understand products of elliptic curves .",
    "let us , therefore , consider a surface @xmath72 which is the product of two smooth elliptic curves .",
    "let us set some notation .",

    "the dimension of the linear system @xmath89 is @xmath90 and thus for a point @xmath91 the expected dimension is @xmath92 .",
    "notice that a divisor of degree three on an elliptic curve is always very ample and embeds the curve as a smooth cubic in @xmath93 . since the smooth plane cubics are classified by their normal forms @xmath94 with @xmath95",
    "the following example reflects the behaviour of any product of elliptic curves embedded via a linear system of bidegree @xmath48 .",
    "[ ex : ellipticcomputation ] consider two smooth plane cubics @xmath96 and @xmath97 the surface @xmath72 is embedded into @xmath98 via the segre embedding @xmath99 we may assume that both curves contain the point @xmath100 as a general non - inflexion point , and the point @xmath101 is mapped by the segre embedding to @xmath102 . if we denote by @xmath103 , @xmath104 , the coordinates on @xmath98 as usual , then the maximal ideal locally at @xmath105 is generated by @xmath106 and @xmath107 , i.e.  these are local coordinates of @xmath73 at @xmath105 .",
    "a standard basis computation shows that locally at @xmath105 the coordinates @xmath103 satisfy modulo the ideal of @xmath73 and up to multiplication by a unit the following congruences ( note , @xmath108 ) @xmath109 thus a hyperplane section @xmath110 of @xmath73 is locally in @xmath105 modulo @xmath111 given by @xmath112 and hence the family of hyperplane sections having multiplicity at least three in @xmath105 is given by @xmath113 but then the family has parameters @xmath114 , and its dimension coincides with the expected dimension @xmath23 .",
    "moreover , the @xmath88-jet of a hyperplane section @xmath115 through @xmath105 with multiplicity at least three is @xmath116 which shows that for a general choice of @xmath117 and @xmath118 the point @xmath105 is an ordinary triple point .",
    "[ ex : elliptic ] we actually can say very precisely what it means that @xmath14 is general in the product , namely that neither @xmath119 is a inflexion point of @xmath78 , nor @xmath120 is a inflexion point of @xmath76 .    indeed , since @xmath75 is very ample of degree three , for each point @xmath91 there is a unique point @xmath121 such that @xmath122 .",
