    "new telescopes are funded on the basis of the expected yield in terms of new science , so it is of interest to compare the current scientific impact of different kinds of telescope , e.g. small vs large , optical vs radio , ground - based vs space .",
    "scientific impact can be measured in a number of ways , including ( 1 ) counting published papers , ( 2 ) counting publications in high - impact journals , and ( 3 ) counting citations to published papers .",
    "( 1 ) counts of papers are easy to make , and several observatories maintain lists of papers based on data obtained with their telescopes , but such counts give equal credit to papers of different scientific merit .",
    "( 2 ) alternatively , one can look at the origin of only the highest - cited papers , or of papers appearing in journals with the highest impact , but the statistical noise is then higher . lamb ( 1990 ) used this approach to chart the changing strength of biological research in different countries .",
    "( 3 ) citation counts provide a fairer measure of the amount of interest generated by papers , and are often used to assess the performance of individuals and organisations , but suffer from a number of biases : @xmath3 geographical bias arises from the tendency of each community to over - cite its own results e.g. through reading and citing national journals ( abt & liu 1989 , schoonbaert & roelants 1998 ) , or e.g. through prefentially citing results first heard at regional conferences .",
    "@xmath3 language bias arises from the tendency of english - speaking scientists not to read or cite papers written in other languages ( noted e.g. by rees 1997 ) and , more subtly , from citation errors ( abt 1992 , kotiaho et al 1999 ) which may cause non - english citations to be missed more often by automatic searches . @xmath3",
    "different scientific disciplines cite at different rates ( abt 1987 ) , and this may be true of different sub - disciplines within astronomy as well .",
    "also , minority fields may be under - cited , and popular topics over - cited , relative to real scientific impact . @xmath3 high citation rates for technical papers may reflect usefulness rather than scientific impact .",
    "@xmath3 self - citations ( trimble 1986 ) are included in citation databases , although for highly - cited papers they are only a small fraction of the total .",
    "mutual - citation networks ( coghlan 1991 ) can also bias the statistics .",
    "another disadvantage of citation statistics is the long time lag between data being taken at the telescope , and citations being made .",
    "citation rates peak about 5 years after publication , according to abt ( 1998 ) , and it might take much longer for the significance of seminal results to be widely recognised .    finally , scientific impact is not the only measure of success for a telescope",
    ". continued funding , whether by the taxpayer or from private sources , depends in part on public interest in individual telescopes , as reflected e.g. in articles in popular journals .",
    "abt ( 1985 ) compared counts of citations of papers generated by two telescopes run by national observatories ( the ctio and kpno 4-m ) with those from two telescopes run by private observatories ( the lick 3-m and palomar 5-m ) , and found them to be statistically indistinguishable .",
    "trimble ( 1995 ) compared the impacts of large us optical telescopes , using the 1993 citation rates of papers published in 1990 - 91 , and extended this analysis in trimble ( 1996 ) to include 29 telescopes worldwide .",
    "the telescopes yielding the most citations were , in decreasing order , the aat 3.9-m , ctio 4-m , kpno 4-m , cfht 3.6-m , palomar 5-m and isaac newton 2.5-m ( see table 4 for a list of abbreviations ) , with a factor of 2 between the first and sixth ranked .",
    "leverington ( 1996 ) looked at samples of the 15% most - cited papers in apj and mnras taken every 4 years between 1958 - 1994 , and found the six most productive ground - based optical telescopes to be the palomar 5-m , aat , lick 3-m , kpno 4-m , ctio 4-m and palomar schmidt .",
    "the vla , and the einstein , iue , cgro and rosat satellites were comparably productive .",
    "he found that paper counts for space telescopes peak about 4 years after launch , and fall to half that rate about 9 years after launch . in leverington",
    "( 1997a ) , he showed that 4-m - class ground - based telescopes were about 50% more cost - effective ( in terms of cost per paper ) than 2-m - class telescopes .",
    "leverington ( 1997b ) extended this analysis to radio and space telescopes , finding that ground - based optical telescopes were ( up to 1994 ) 2 - 3 times as cost - effective as space telescopes .",
    "hst appears particularly inefficient when judged by this metric , but as pasachoff ( 1997 ) pointed out , this may highlight the limitations of paper - counting rather than indicate a poor return on investment .",
    "gopal - krishna & barve ( 1998 ) analysed astronomy papers published in nature 1993 - 5 and found that of the 51 based on data from ground - based optical telescopes , 45% used only data from telescopes with mirror diameter @xmath4 2.5 m. they concluded that much front - rank science is still done by modest - sized telescopes , and that the productive life of optical telescopes is long .",
    "bergeron & grothkopf ( 1999 ) ranked selected telescopes by publication counts , and found the order for 1997/8 to be wht , eso 3.6-m , ntt , aat , eso 2.2-m , int , cfht , ctio 4-m , kpno 4-m .",
    "massey et al ( 2000 ) used counts of papers from the kpno 4-m and wiyn telescopes to compare the scientific impact of classical and queue observing , and found no evidence that the latter has higher impact .",
    "citation analyses of the productivity of us , uk and dutch astronomers of different standing were made by trimble ( 1993a ) , trimble ( 1993b ) and spruit ( 1996 ) respectively .",
    "we made two independent analyses of the scientific impact of telescopes of different sizes and types .",
    "( 1 ) for a citations - based metric , we drew on a list of the 125 most - cited astronomy papers published in each year 1991 - 8 ( 1000 papers in all ) , calculating the fraction of citations attributable to papers based on data from each telescope .",
    "( 2 ) for a metric which is free of some of the biases affecting citation counts , and which responds faster to scientific trends ( but which may still be affected by regional and subject biases ) , we analysed counts of papers in the journal nature , to which much of the best science is submitted .",
    "nature has the highest impact factor ( citations / article ) of any journal , about 8 times greater than that of mnras or apj .",
    "in addition , for a metric reflecting public interest , we counted mentions in the journal sky & telescope .    throughout , we use the word ` impact ' ( unless otherwise qualified ) to refer to the normalised fraction of citations to the 1000 most - cited papers .    to 7.1 cm",
    "a list of the 125 most - cited astronomy / space papers for each year 1991 - 8 , 1000 papers in all , was obtained from david pendlebury of the institute for scientific information ( isi ) in philadelphia .",
    "the isi list covers 21 journals , including a&a , a&as , apj , apjs , aj , ara&a , mnras , nature , pasp , science , and solar physics ( using the standard abbreviations ) . for each paper",
    "the list gives the name of the first author , an abbreviated title , and the count of citations to that paper up to june 1999 .",
    "we added the names of the telescopes which furnished the data on which each paper was based , and a subject code : sun , solar system , exoplanets , cool stars , hot stars ( including gamma - ray bursts ) , the galaxy , galaxies , active galaxies or cosmology .",
    "450 of the 1000 papers were not classified by telescope , being theoretical ( 27% ) , or reviews ( 6% ) or using data from many ( @xmath1 5 ) telescopes ( 8% ) or telescopes which could not be identified ( 5% ) .",
    "the fraction of theoretical papers is similar to that found by abt ( 1993 ) for us astronomical journals as a whole , 28% .",
    "citations of reviews comprise about 1% of all citations ( abt 1995 ) .    to 11 cm",
    "the number of citations decreases with increasing year of publication ( fig . 1",
    ", see also abt 1981 ) , e.g. the 20th ranked paper of 1998 has only 26 citations , whereas the 20th ranked in 1991 has 158 . in order to give equal weight to similarly - ranked papers published in different years",
    ", we expressed the citation count for each paper as a fraction of the total of citations for the 125 top papers published that year . with this normalisation ,",
    "the highest - cited paper of 1991 - 8 is that by smoot et al ( 1992 ) ( cobe results ) .    for each telescope",
    ", we summed the number of papers , and calculated the average citation fraction , for the periods 1991 - 4 , 1995 - 8 and 1991 - 8 .",
    "about 1/3 of the observational papers are based on data from more than one telescope ( this figure rises to 2/3 for papers based on data from 4-m telescopes ) . in each of these cases",
    ", the count of papers for each telescope @xmath5 was incremented by a weight @xmath6 where @xmath7 = 1 , and where the relative weights used for different types of telescope were 1 for 1-m ground - based optical / ir , 4 for 2-m , 10 for 4-m , 50 for 10-m , 10 for sub - mm , 10 for radio , 100 for hst , and 30 for other space telescopes .",
    "e.g. if a paper used data from a 4-m class telescope and from asca ( space telescope ) , the count of papers for the 4-m telescope was incremented by 0.25 , that of asca by 0.75 ( and similarly for the citation count ) .",
    "the relative weights of optical ground - based telescopes were estimated assuming that scientific impact @xmath8 collecting area , justified by examination of fig .",
    "the relative weights of ground - based optical and other telescopes were based on average impacts deduced from fig .",
    "initially , the counts were calculated with all weights set to 1 .",
    "the weights were then estimated from figs . 2 and 3 and the analysis repeated , this time with weighting . the new versions of figs . 2 and 3",
    "were then found to be consistent with the applied weighting .",
    "it should be emphasised that that changing all the weights to 1 significantly changes the counts for only a few small telescopes .",
    "the weights were used principally to avoid over - estimation of the contribution from 1-m telescopes , since these are often cited in conjunction with larger telescopes .",
    "the other conclusions of this paper are not affected by the choice of weighting .    to 11 cm    for none of the large ground - based or space telescopes",
    "are the counts dominated by citations to only one or two papers . nor are the citation statistics much affected by technical papers and catalogues receiving unusually large numbers of citations .",
    "a rare example is landolt s ( 1992 ) paper on photometric standards , the second most - cited paper of that year , which accounts for the high 1991 - 4 impact of the ctio 1-m .",
    "impacts as measured by counts of papers in the isi database , and counts of citations to those papers , are similar , since there is only a weak dependence of citation count on rank in the isi database ( e.g. a factor of two between 20th and 125th ranked ) .",
    "we made a similar analysis of the 452 observational astronomy / space papers ( including letters , articles and reviews ) published in nature during the 10 years 1989 - 98 , again distributing counts between telescopes where more than one contributed to a given paper .",
    "the number of astronomy papers published in nature each year did not change significantly during this period .",
    "the slightly earlier start date than for the citations analysis allows coverage of a similar sample of new science , since publication in nature is rapid .",
    "approximately 100 of the nature papers appear also in the sample of the most - cited 1000 papers .",
    "finally , in order to gauge public interest in different telescopes , we counted mentions in the ` news notes ' section of sky & telescope during 1989 - 98 .",
    "for each telescope , counts of papers from the 1000 most - cited , average citation fractions ( to these papers ) for 1991 - 4 and 1995 - 8 , and counts of papers in nature and of mentions in sky & telescope are given in tables 1 ( ground - based optical ) , 2 ( other ground - based ) and 3 ( space ) .",
    "the tables include all telescopes with a total of more than 1.0 paper in the top - cited 1000 , or in the nature sample , or generating more than 0.1% of citations in either period . for reference , table 1 also lists all ground - based optical ( non - military ) telescopes with primary - mirror diameter @xmath1 3.5 m which had been commissioned by 1996 .",
    "the numbers of theoretical and review papers ( and citations to them ) are included at the bottom of table 1 .",
    "the counts in tables 1 - 3 are sums of fractions ( as discussed in section 2 above ) .",
    "fractional statistical errors on the telescope citation counts are thus @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the number of papers to which citations are made .    to 7 cm    the relationship between 1995 - 8 citation count and telescope diameter for optical telescopes is shown in fig .",
    "2 . a comparison between 1991 - 4 and 1995 - 8 counts , for all telescopes , is shown in fig .",
    "3 . the fractional contribution of different types of telescope to the totals , for each period ,",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "the ground - based optical telescopes can conveniently be divided into four classes : 1-m ( diameter @xmath4 2 m ) ; 2-m ( 2.0 @xmath11 diameter @xmath4 3.0 m ) ; 4-m ( 3.0 @xmath11 diameter @xmath4 7 m , mostly 3.5 - 4.2 m ) ; and 10-m ( mirror diameter @xmath12 7 m , i.e. keck i / ii , the only ones in this class commissioned by 1996 ) .    of the 14 4-m - class optical telescopes ( i.e. excluding irtf , ukirt ) , 8 have similar 1995 - 8 impacts , between 0.55 and 0.95% of citations .",
    "they are the aat 4-m , ctio 4-m , eso 4-m , hale 5-m ( 50 years old ) , lick 3-m ( 40 years old ) , kpno 4-m , mmt 6-m and wht 4-m telescopes .",
    "we confirm abt s ( 1985 ) finding that the impacts of privately run telescopes ( hale , lick ) are not significantly different from those of national facilities .",
    "the cfht 4-m has particularly high impact , with 1.8% of citations .",
    "the wht ranks second .",
    "the cfht citations are to a total of 18 papers , 10 with first authors at canadian institutions , 6 us , 1 french , and 1 uk . the calar alto 4-m yields a factor of @xmath2 4 fewer citations than the average .",
    "the arc and wiyn 4-m telescopes have low impact , perhaps because they were not commissioned until 1993 , 1994 , and citations have yet to appear in the literature .",
    "the other telescopes were all in regular use by 1990 ( mmt was in its multi - mirror incarnation throughout this period ) .",
    "no papers from the mt .",
    "pastukhov 6-m telescope appear in the citations database . in fig .",
    "3 , @xmath2 0.2 of the scatter in log10 is due to small - number statistics , but the impact of several telescopes has changed significantly between 1991 - 4 and 1995 - 8 ( figs . 5 , 6 ) .    to 11 cm    to 11 cm",
    "the keck i 10-m telescope , which has been in use since 1993 , has an impact of 6% of all 1995 - 8 citations , 8 times that of typical 4-m telescopes .",
    "this factor is similar to the ratio of collecting areas .",
    "the ( noisier ) statistics for keck ii are consistent with similar impact per unit time .",
    "29 of the 34 cited keck papers are on extragalactic topics .",
    "no papers from other 8-m - 10-m telescopes appear in the citations database ( most were commissioned after 1998 ) .",
    "the mean citation impact of 2-m class telescopes is a factor @xmath2 4 lower than that of 4-m telescopes , again reflecting the ratio of collecting areas .",
    "comparison of individual telescopes is difficult because the numbers involved are small ( table 1 ) .",
    "little can be said about the mean impact of 1-m telescopes because of poor statistics , but the distribution in fig .",
    "2 is consistent with mean impact being roughly proportional to collecting area .",
    "citation counts may underestimate the scientific usefulness of small telescopes because they often provide uncited survey material on which are based discoveries ( e.g. of high - redshift objects ) made by large telescopes .",
    "the 1-m and 2-m telescopes together contributed one half as much science ( 4.4% ) as the 4-m telescopes ( 8.5% ) during 1995 - 8 ( the ratio was similar in 1991 - 4 ; fig 4 ) .",
    "three of the top 40 most - cited papers are based on data from 1-m telescopes only , including two from the microlensing survey carried out with the mt .",
    "stromlo 1.3-m ( hence its high impact , figs . 2 , 3 ) .",
    "extrasolar planets were also discovered using a small telescope : the haute provence 1.9-m ( mayor & queloz 1995 , the 9th most - cited paper of 1995 ) .",
    "the capital costs of telescopes of primary mirror diameter @xmath13 scale approximately as @xmath14 , for @xmath15 7 m ( schmidt - kaler & rucks , 1997 ) .",
    "8-m - 10-m telescopes currently cost about 1/3 as much as predicted by this scaling .",
    "running costs dominate total cost , and scale as a similar ( slightly smaller ) power of @xmath13 as do capital costs ( abt 1980 , although he only explored the relation for @xmath15 2.1 m ) .",
    "the year-2000 capital costs of 2-m ( median size 2.5 m ) , 4-m and 10-m class telescopes are @xmath2 @xmath165 m , 18 m and 80 m , while the citation rates are in the approximate ratio 1:3:25 ( fig .",
    "2 ) . therefore 2-m telescopes are roughly as cost - effective as 4-m telescopes .",
    "keck i ( 10 m ) is twice as cost - effective , but is the first of its size , and may have a bigger scientific impact than any of the 11 8-m - 10-m telescopes now coming online : 4 vlt , 2 gemini , subaru , lbt , het , salt and grantecan .",
    "the citation counts for the ukirt 3.8-m and irtf 3.0-m ir telescopes are a factor @xmath2 3 lower than for the ground - based 4-m optical telescopes , perhaps reflecting a smaller user community ( fewer citers ) , see later discussion of fig .",
    "the sub - mm telescope jcmt generated 1.3% of 1995 - 8 citations , nearly twice as much as a typical 4-m , due largely to 6 1997/8 papers based on data from scuba , the innovative sub - mm imager .",
    "no papers from eso s sest appear in the citations database .",
    "the mm telescope iram is highly productive , with 0.8% of citations .",
    "the vla generated 1.5% of 1995 - 8 citations .",
    "it cost @xmath2 @xmath1680 m in the 1970s .",
    "all other radio telescopes combined generated 0.6% of 1995 - 8 citations ( but 1.4% in 1991 - 4 ) .",
    "radio telescopes are more prominent in the counts of nature papers ( see discussion below of fig .",
    "no papers from the atca , effelsberg , most or wsrt radio telescopes appear in the citations database .",
    "the vlbi observations were typically made with @xmath2 10 - 20 telescopes across the globe , but the contributing telescopes are often not identified in the published papers .",
    "hst , launched in 1990 , generates 15 times as many citations as a 4-m telescope ( 11% of the 1995 - 8 total ) , but cost @xmath2 100 times as much , @xmath2 @xmath162000 m ( a lot more , if the cost of servicing missions is taken into account ) .",
    "asca , bepposax , cgro , cobe , hipparcos , rosat all yielded citation fractions between 2.6 and 3.8% of the total , @xmath2 4 times higher than a 4-m telescope , but cost @xmath2 15 - 30 times as much .",
    "comparison of the cost - effectiveness of ground - based and space telescopes is not straightforward .",
    "some space telescopes ( e.g. cobe , hipparcos ) are launched to solve a specific scientific problem which ca nt be tackled from the ground and they may have a short - lived community of citers , so it s not clear that citation counts are a fair measure of scientific impact .",
    "others , such as hst , compete more directly with ground - based facilities ( particularly now , with the advent of adaptive optics ) , and can be used to tackle similar problems , so a citation - based comparison of cost - effectiveness is fairer . in hst s case , the cost per citation is probably @xmath2 10 - 20 times that for a ground - based optical telescope .",
    "the citation shares of asca , cgro , cobe and hst peaked respectively 3 , 2 , 3 and 6 years after launch .    in fig .",
    "7 the citation counts are compared with counts of papers in nature . most of the telescopes contributing more than one paper to the top - cited 1000 have also generated nature papers . there is a positive correlation between citation fraction and nature counts , and a line of slope 1 is shown .",
    "however the constant of proportionality is different for different kinds of telescope .",
    "the line shows the approximate relation for ground - based optical telescopes .",
    "the ratio between citation fraction and number of nature papers is @xmath2 twice as high for space telescopes as for optical telescopes . for radio telescopes ,",
    "the ratio is _ lower _ than for optical telescopes .",
    "for the vla , the ratio is a factor of @xmath2 3 lower , while for atca , effelsberg , most , parkes , vlba , vlbi and wsrt , the factor is @xmath17 10 .",
    "this is not due to a regional bias in publishing practice , because the counts for optical telescopes from all countries cluster closely about the line in fig .",
    "if one assumes that publication in nature is a reliable measure of scientific worth , this result indicates that citation counts undervalue radio work relative to optical work ( alternatively , radio work may be over - represented in nature ) .",
    "this highlights the risk of incurring metric - specific biases when comparing the scientific impacts of telescopes of different kinds .    for ir , sub - mm and mm telescopes ( ukirt , irtf , jcmt , iram , nobeyama , owens valley )",

    "these regional ( or cultural ) differences in preferred subject area are also reflected in the extragalactic fraction in different journals : 62% for apj , 83% for mnras , 30% for a&a , 47% for nature .",
    "if galactic and extragalactic astronomers had different citation practices , these differences could induce a regional bias in the citation counts . to test this",

    "<S> the scientific impacts of telescopes worldwide have been compared on the basis of their contributions to ( a ) the 1000 most - cited astronomy papers published 1991 - 8 ( 125 from each year ) , and ( b ) the 452 astronomy papers published in nature 1989 - 98 . 1-m and 2-m ground - based telescopes account for @xmath0 5% of the citations to the top - cited papers , 4-m telescopes 10% , keck </S>",
    "<S> i / ii 4% , sub - mm and radio telescopes 4% , hst 8% , other space telescopes 23% . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining citations are mainly to theoretical and review papers . </S>",
    "<S> the strong showing by 1-m and 2-m telescopes in the 1990s augurs well for the continued scientific impact of 4-m telescopes in the era of 8-m telescopes . </S>",
    "<S> the impact of individual ground - based optical telescopes is proportional to collecting area ( and approximately proportional to capital cost ) . </S>",
    "<S> the impacts of the various 4-m telescopes are similar , with cfht leading in citation counts , and wht in nature papers . </S>",
    "<S> hst has about 15 times the citation impact of a 4-m ground - based telescope , but cost @xmath1 100 times as much . </S>",
    "<S> citation counts are proportional to counts of papers published in nature , but for radio telescopes the ratio is a factor @xmath2 3 smaller than for optical telescopes , highlighting the danger of using either metric alone to compare the impacts of different types of telescope . </S>",
    "<S> breakdowns of citation counts by subject ( 52% extragalactic ) , and journal ( apj 44% , nature 11% , mnras 9% , a&a 6% ) are also presented . </S>"
