    "galaxy formation and evolution in a cold dark matter ( cdm ) dominated universe can be described in the most general terms as being driven by the gravitationally induced hierarchical growth of structure in the dark matter component coupled to the baryonic matter within the merging and accreting dark matter halos . while the dark matter is collisionless , baryonic matter dissipates energy by radiative cooling and thereby is able to form stars .",
    "feedback effects are thought to self - regulate the latter process .",
    "directly observing the fundamentally important hierarchical growth of dark matter halos is not possible at the present time .",
    "information about the growth of the halos has to be deduced from observations of galaxies or clusters .",
    "large gravitational lensing surveys detecting cosmic shear will allow the study of dark matter structure formation directly in the future . in the meantime",
    ", it has proven difficult to deduce halo growth from observations of galaxy growth .",
    "galaxies themselves grow in stellar mass firstly by star formation , and secondly by accreting smaller galaxies and by merging with similarly sized galaxies .",
    "both of these processes need to be mapped out if we wish to fully understand the assembly history of galaxies and their host dark matter halos .",
    "progress has been made in recent years in measuring the build - up of stellar mass density from redshift @xmath22 to the present epoch @xcite . also , the stellar mass function has been mapped locally @xcite and in some detail to @xmath23 @xcite with generally good agreement between different datasets . to some lesser detail and accuracy deep surveys",

    "these mass functions tend to agree fairly well at @xmath26 , while the integrated mass densities may differ by a factor of @xmath27 at higher @xmath15 ( see , e.g. , comparisons in @xcite and @xcite ) . in summary , data are now available that describe the mass in stars from an early epoch where only @xmath28 of the current mass density was in place until the present time .    deep optical and near - infrared surveys , as well as mid - infrared data from the spitzer space telescope and sub - mm surveys have greatly expanded our understanding of the cosmic star formation ( sf ) history .",
    "the integrated star formation rate @xcite is now quite well constrained to @xmath14 ( with some estimates at even higher @xmath15 ) from a multitude of studies employing different methods at wavelengths from the uv to the far - ir @xcite .    in the recent literature , more attention",
    "is being devoted to the star formation rate ( sfr ) as a function of stellar mass , usually in the form of the specific star formation rate ( ssfr ) as a function of stellar mass @xcite .",
    "progress on the merger rate and its evolution with redshift has been somewhat slower .",
    "observational results obtained from galaxy pair statistics vary considerably , finding merger rates @xmath29 with @xmath30 in the redshift range @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "early studies tend to give somewhat higher numbers than the more recent work .",

    "little is known about the dependence of the merger rate on galaxy luminosity or mass .",
    "recently , @xcite find evidence from the @xmath34-band luminosity function of galaxies in major - merger pairs that the local merger rate decreases with galaxy mass .    in this paper , we present a method to infer the presence of merging activity and as such the underlying hierarchical growth of structure from a comparison of observations of galaxy mass functions with observations of star formation rates in the galaxies .",
    "essentially , we compare a measurement of the time derivative of the mass function ( the number density of galaxies per unit stellar mass ; @xmath35 ) with an expectation derived from time - integrating the ( average ) star formation rate of galaxies as a function of mass , @xmath36 .",
    "the difference between the two can then be attributed to mass function evolution due to `` external causes '' , which we identify with accretion and merging ( after taking the survey selection effects into account ) .",
    "we present our results with caution , given the limitations of the current dataset .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in   [ sec : desc - mass ] we establish a formalism that compares the change in the stellar mass function expected from the observed star formation rate as a function of mass and time to the observed time derivative of the mass function .",
    "the aim is to deduce a merger rate ( or , more precisely , the change in number density due to merging ) as a function of galaxy mass and time from the difference of the two .",
    "we will call this quantity the _ assembly rate_.   [ sec : mass - function ] and   [ sec : sfr ] present the mass function data and the star formation rate data , respectively .",
    "also , suitable parametrizations of the data and its evolution with time are presented and discussed .",

    "[ sec : dphisfr ] discusses the change of the mass function that is expected due to the star formation rate only . ",
    "[ sec : mergerrate ] finally combines the former two results to discuss the change in number density due to merging we infer from our data .",

    "[ sec : summary ] .    throughout this work",
    "we assume @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "a general description of the evolution of galaxy stellar mass with time can be given in terms of ( 1 ) internal evolution due to star formation in the galaxy , and ( 2 ) externally - driven evolution due to the infall of other smaller galaxies ( accretion ) or the merging with another galaxy of comparable size .",
    "the former can be measured by finding the average star formation rate as a function of stellar mass and time , @xmath36 .",
    "the latter can not be measured reliably at this point . however ,",
    "if one knew the time derivative of the galaxy stellar mass function ( gsmf ) , @xmath39 , then it could in principle be derived by comparing the internal evolution due to star formation to the total observed evolution , and thereby inferred from the difference between the two .",
    "first , we note that the evolution of the gsmf due to star formation in the galaxies by definition preserves the number of galaxies",
    ". hence the change of the gsmf due to star formation is described by a continuity equation in @xmath35 :    @xmath40\\ , .\\ ] ]    here , somewhat unconventionally , we have taken @xmath41 to mean `` due to star formation '' .",
    "this equation becomes intuitively clear if one considers that the continuity equation above means that the change in numbers in a given stellar mass bin @xmath42 is given by the difference across this bin of the number of objects entering the bin from below and the number of galaxies leaving the bin to higher masses , both owing to their star formation rate .",
    "hence the derivative with respect to mass of the number density times the star formation rate ( which gives the difference of mass flux across the bin ) on the right hand side .",
    "the change with time of the gsmf , @xmath39 , and the average sfr as a function of galaxy mass and time , @xmath36 , are in principle directly observable .",
    "we can therefore infer the change in the gsmf due to all processes other than star formation ( which we will identify with merging ) from these two functions .",
    "we will call the resulting quantity the _ assembly rate _ :    @xmath43    hence ,    @xmath44\\,\\ ] ]        where we have left out the arguments for brevity and divided by @xmath45 to obtain an equation for the relative change .",
    "note that ( tidal ) stripping of stars from a galaxy ( e.g.  in clusters or in interactions ) contributes to eq .",
    "[ eq : merge2 ] as well . assuming that this loss of stellar mass is small compared to the overall growth rate of a galaxy , it can be neglected .",
    "the _ assembly rate _ is given in terms of the change in number density per unit time rather than in number of discrete merging events per object per unit time ( and per unit merger mass ratio ) .",
    "therefore , we can only speak of an effective merger rate , equivalent in its effect on the number density to an equal number of same - mass mergers per unit time interval .",
    "an alternative is to think about this quantity as simply representing the average effective mass accretion rate .",
    "we can not discern the mass spectrum of accretion and merging events that actually cause the observed change in the mass function .",
    "it is also important to point out that a value of zero does not imply that no accretion and merging are happening , but only that the mass flux entering a mass bin through merging and the mass flux leaving that same mass bin through merging are equal , and hence the number density at this mass does not change .",
    "values below zero imply that the number density decreases due to merging activity , and hence objects are preferably being accreted onto more massive objects and thus destroyed . to emphasize the difference between what we measure and the merger rate expressed as the number of merger events per unit time and object",
    ", we will avoid using the term merger rate and prefer the name _",
    "assembly rate_.    in the following sections we shall compile the necessary terms from gsmf and star formation data available in the literature .",

    "if one takes the schmidt - kennicutt law to read @xmath152 ( with @xmath153 denoting surface density and @xmath154 being the dynamical timescale , see @xcite ) , then @xmath155 ( with @xmath156 denoting the characteristic velocity of the system and @xmath157 its radius ) . using the virial relation we have @xmath158 , which , with @xmath159 , becomes @xmath160 . using the disk scaling relations given in @xcite instead of the ( halo ) virial relation ( @xmath161 ; @xmath162 ) ,",
    "one obtains @xmath163 for average halo spin parameter and fraction of disk angular momentum . both of these arguments assume a fixed scaling of cold gas surface density with total mass surface density",
    "now that we have assembled all the necessary data , we turn back to eq .",
    "( [ eq : merge ] ) . the right hand side of eq .",

    "we use the parametrization of the evolution of the stellar mass function as established in   [ sec : mass - function ] . from this parametrization",

    "[ fig : schechter ] in ",
    "[ sec : mass - function ] .",
    "it is important to note that while the uncertainties on the mass function itself are rather large , the parameterization of its evolution provides much smaller formal uncertainties on the derivative with respect to time that is of interest here .",
    "note that our parametrization of the mass function assumes a fixed faint - end slope of @xmath166 ( the data do not allow us to measure the slope at higher redshift ; up to @xmath167 , the slope is consistent with being constant ) . hence the time derivative of the mass function becomes independent of mass at masses below the characteristic mass , @xmath55 , where the mass function is a power law . in the right hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : dphidt ] this means that the low mass curves ( below @xmath168 ) all lie on top of each other .",
    "the most rapid buildup of the mass function happens ( not unexpectedly ) at high redshift and at the high - mass end . at @xmath14 and @xmath121 , the number density approximately doubles every gyr , while the density of @xmath168 objects ( typical lyman break galaxies ) increases by 50% per gyr . at @xmath105 ,",
    "the change in number densities is much more modest , of the order of 10 - 20% per gyr ( and likely decreasing further rapidly ) , so that the mass density roughly doubles between @xmath169 and @xmath170 , a behavior observed and confirmed by many studies mentioned in the introduction .",
    "there is rather little differential evolution in the fors deep field stellar mass function in the sense that the ratio of the change at high mass and at low mass evolves from a factor of @xmath171 at high @xmath15 to a factor @xmath27 at @xmath172 .",
    "this has been noted in @xcite ; see their fig .",
    "@xcite , analyzing data similarly in the goods - music survey , find that this ratio tends to zero at late times , such that the buildup of the @xmath173 galaxy population is complete by @xmath169 while it still continues slowly in our sample ( compare also studies of elliptical galaxies , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this discrepancy , apparent in a number of datasets  whether it is due to the small volume of the fdf at low @xmath15 , the photometric redshifts , the stellar population modeling technique , or other effects  has yet to be resolved .",
    "since the main focus of this paper is to discuss the method presented here to analyze mass function and star formation rate data , we will not spend too much time discussing peculiarities of the present dataset .",
    "we are fully aware that the current data have significant deficiencies ( both in mass and star formation rate ) , yet they still offer the possibility to discover and learn about fundamental trends in the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "after the derivative of the mass function , we turn to the second term on the right hand side of eq .",

    "note that this is not a trivial statement : if the number of objects leaving a mass bin @xmath181 in the time interval @xmath182 due to their star formation rate @xmath143 is larger than the number of objects entering the same bin from lower mass due to their own star formation ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : cont ] ) ) , the number density at this mass would decrease .",
    "it is a matter of comparing the derivatives w.r.t .",
    "mass of the mass function and the star formation rate .    in the low - mass range , the stellar mass function",
    "is well represented by a power law with slope @xmath183 ( locally ) , and we have assumed that this slope does not evolve with time ( which is backed by the data up to @xmath167 ; see   [ sec : mass - function ] and also @xcite ) .",
    "the star formation rate is also well described by a power law ( see   [ sec : sfr ] ) , @xmath184 , with @xmath108 .",

    "we wish to note here that we are very likely to miss low - mass low star formation part of the galaxy population , hence we very likely underestimate the slope of the stellar mass function , especially at higher redshift .    at high redshift and high mass",
    ", we see that star formation leads to a strong increase in number density .",
    "the number of objects with @xmath188 roughly doubles every gyr at @xmath189 .",

    "the number density very rapidly increases ( due to star formation ) at a rate comparable to that of high - mass objects . unlike the high mass objects , however , the growth due to star formation persists in low mass objects for much longer , dropping to a rate of 0.5  gyr@xmath18 at @xmath169 and 0.2  gyr@xmath18 at @xmath172 . while the number density of massive galaxies is not changing significantly anymore due to star formation at low @xmath15 , that of low - mass galaxies does .",
    "finally , we have all the ingredients necessary to fully evaluate eq .",
    "( [ eq : merge2 ] ) , which we do in fig .",
    "[ fig : mergerrate ] , showing our results again versus mass in the left panel and against redshift in the right panel .",
    "we will use the less cumbersome term _ assembly rate _ for `` change in number density due to merging '' in what follows .",
    "we remind the reader to be mindful of the difference between this quantity and the merger rate ( see   [ sec : desc - mass ] ) .",
    "confidence regions in fig .",
    "[ fig : mergerrate ] are calculated by means of monte carlo realizations of data within the uncertainties in the mass function evolution and the star formation rates , and propagating those through eq .",
    "( [ eq : merge2 ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting that since the constraints on the derivatives of @xmath194 and @xmath195 with respect to time are much tighter than the constraints on these quantities themselves , the error budget in fig .",
    "[ fig : mergerrate ] is dominated by the uncertainty in the average star formation rate .",
    "this leads to formally small errors at masses and redshifts with low star formation rates .    the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : mergerrate ] are negative at low mass and positive at high mass , with the zero - crossing mass evolving from higher masses at high redshift to lower masses at lower redshift .",
    "this means that once star formation is accounted for , a source of high mass objects and a sink of low mass objects is necessary to explain the mass function data . in the most general terms , this is consistent with merging activity building up higher mass objects from ( many ) lower mass ones . in this picture ,",
    "the merger rate decreases with time ( the absolute value of the curves decreases with time ) .",
    "also , the mass at which the merger rate tends to increase the number density instead of decreasing it ( the mass above which objects are accreted onto and below which objects are destroyed ) decreases with time .",
    "however , an important caveat is that a loss of objects could also be due to ( faint ) objects dropping out of the survey as soon as their star formation activity ceases .",
    "this can partly explain the negative values observed at low masses and the trend mentioned above .    in the following we shall look into the merger rates as a function of mass and time in more detail .      at high redshift and high masses , the time - evolution in the mass function shows a rapid increase in number density of high mass objects ( see   [ sec : dphidt ] ) .",
    "star formation accounts for most of this increase , leaving a difference consistent with zero at @xmath121 and a small positive difference of @xmath196  gyr@xmath18 at @xmath197 and @xmath2 . however , our parametrization of @xmath54 flattens at high redshifts and over - predicts the normalization of the mass function in the bin at high @xmath15 ( compare the high-@xmath15 data point in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : schechter ] ) . as a result ,",
    "the total change in the mass function is smaller in the parameterized fit to @xmath54 compared to the raw data by about 30% .",
    "therefore , if we use the schechter functions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mf ] directly , which show a steeper increase in @xmath194 at @xmath2 , instead of the smooth parametrization @xmath198 , the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : mergerrate ] move up , and the inferred assembly rate becomes larger by the same amount .    given this uncertainty ,",
    "we feel that the star formation rate we observe is roughly sufficient to explain the increase in number density at high mass and high redshift . as an upper limit ,",
    "at most 0.50.8 effective major mergers per gyr are consistent with the data .",
    "this number , though , would be enough to transform most of these early high mass objects into ellipticals contemporaneously with their major star formation episode .",
    "this is consistent with the picture emerging from various observations in the local universe and at high redshift which show that most massive ellipticals form quickly and early , with more massive galaxies being older , and their stars having formed more rapidly ( e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "as we have seen , the data point towards small galaxies being destroyed and large galaxies being built by mergers , with the caveat of selection effects being responsible for parts of this trend .    a plausible interpretation instead of invoking a high destruction rate due to mergers , is based on the fact that low mass objects with low star formation rates ( and therefore redder colors ) are very likely missing from the survey . if the slope of the mass function were steeper due to the existence of a class of low - mass objects missing from the survey , we d need an even higher destruction rate at low masses , due to the increase in numbers and decrease in the average star formation rate .",
    "however , if the star formation rate as a function of mass were steeper , @xmath199 instead of @xmath4 either due to lower star formation at low masses or higher star formation at high masses , the difference would be close to zero below @xmath121 at all times , and little change ( @xmath200  gyr@xmath18 ) in number density due to merging would be necessary .",
    "this would imply that at low masses , merging is creating objects of any particular mass at the same rate as these objects are incorporated into larger structures .",
    "our current dataset is most reliable ( both in terms of mass completeness and robustness of the star formation rate estimate ) at redshifts @xmath26 and at masses @xmath201 . here ,",
    "the photometric data are deep enough to detect objects over a large dynamic range in @xmath202 , and , also , intergalactic absorption ( the lyman break ) does not affect the optical bands yet , such that the object s spectral energy distributions are well - sampled from the rest - frame uv into the optical and near - ir .    at @xmath203 the assembly rate is increasing towards higher stellar masses and towards lower redshift , mostly due to the rapid decline of the star formation rate in this regime , but it is always very low .",
    "most of the increase in number density of massive galaxies is fully explained by the star formation rates observed .",
    "it is very difficult to measure the high mass end of the mass function accurately .",
    "these objects are rare , and on the steep exponential tail of the mass function any small error in distance ( due to the use of photometric redshifts ) or error in @xmath202 will lead to a large error in the number density . also , the effects of cosmic variance are largest in this mass range and may heavily bias results especially in relatively small - area surveys as the fdf .",
    "some assurance is provided by the fact that the @xmath124 mass functions of a number of surveys agree reasonably well .",
    "if our measurement of the high mass end of the mass function at @xmath16 is correct , mergers only contribute to the growth of the mass function at @xmath129 and only on a low level .",
    "a growth of only 0.1  0.2  gyr@xmath18 is consistent with our data .",
    "this is equivalent to about 1 effective major merger per object in the redshift range @xmath20 .",
    "if , on the other hand , there is less evolution at the high mass end of the mass function , e.g.  as found by @xcite , then no merging at all would be required at high mass ( compare also the mass functions in @xcite and @xcite ) . however , there is strong observational evidence that recent merging does play a role at least in field elliptical galaxies ( e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "other studies of the merger rate do not help to answer this question .",
    "on one side , @xcite studied signatures of interaction and tidal debris in a sample of nearby red galaxies . with some assumptions on the timescale of the merger events ,",
    "they conclude that the present day accretion rate in e / s0 galaxies is @xmath204  gyr@xmath18 , a value that is fully consistent with our measurement , assuming that red sequence galaxies comprise the majority of the @xmath205 local galaxy population .",
    "also , @xcite find that 50 - 70% of galaxies with @xmath206 have undergone a major merger since @xmath169 ( see also @xcite ) . on the other side , @xcite and @xcite find a much lower merger rate .",
    "they argue that in the deep2 survey , only @xmath207 of massive galaxies have undergone a major merger since @xmath208 .",
    "@xcite also argue for a low contribution of mergers at the high mass end .",
    "an overview of a number of studies is given in @xcite .",
    "as we have mentioned , the general trend in the data is for the assembly rate to become more positive with time . the zero - crossing mass decreases with time . in high mass objects , the assembly rate starts out at zero or slightly below , with star formation rates dominating the initial increase in number density .",
    "the assembly rate then increases , such that at low @xmath15 , merging becomes the dominant process that increases the number density at masses @xmath7 .",
    "the growth rate in this mass and redshift range is 0.1  0.2  gyr@xmath18 .",
    "lower - mass galaxies are consumed in these mergers .",
    "the mass at which the assembly rate transitions from objects being consumed to objects being formed decreases with time , roughly tracing the break mass in the star formation rate .",
    "the zero - crossing of the assembly rate occurs at @xmath209 at @xmath210 , @xmath211 at @xmath212 , @xmath213 at @xmath214 , and @xmath215 at @xmath216 .",
    "while merging is still happening below this transition mass , the net number of objects decreases there .",
    "hence , at lower redshift , the number density of progressively lower - mass galaxies starts to increase due to merging .",
    "this is a direct observation of the top - down buildup of the red sequence , where major merger remnants are found ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is interesting to note that in cdm , e.g.  in the @xcite formalism , we expect the opposite behavior : the characteristic mass increases with time , and hence progressively more massive halos preferably get incorporated into even larger structures , and their number density begins to decline .",
    "however , this formalism assumes that merged halos do not survive as substructure within their parent halos .",
    "accounting for the survival of substructure , e.g.  the existence of satellite galaxies or galaxies within clusters , might account for this apparent discrepancy .",
    "this will be explored in a follow - up paper .",
    "summarizing our results , we present average star formation rates as a function of stellar mass and redshift , @xmath36 , for galaxies in the fors deep field spanning @xmath217 .",
    "we directly measure their star formation histories as a function of stellar mass by integrating the former quantity .    at @xmath2",
    "the average star formation rate is monotonically rising with stellar mass and is well - fitted by a power law of stellar mass with exponent @xmath108 .",
    "the average star formation rates in the most massive objects at this redshift are 100  500  @xmath5 , suggesting that these are the progenitors of modern day massive ellipticals seen during their major epoch of star formation . at redshift @xmath6 , the star formation rates starts to drop at the high mass end while still being an increasing function of mass at lower masses .",
    "the power - law exponent is consistent with staying constant . as redshift decreases further",
    ", the star formation rates drop at progressively lower masses ( downsizing ) , dropping most rapidly with redshift for high mass ( @xmath7 ) galaxies .",
    "the mass at which the star formation rate starts to deviate from the power law form ( break mass ) progresses smoothly from @xmath218 at @xmath9 to @xmath10 at @xmath11 . for comparison , in the local universe @xcite find a characteristic mass of @xmath219 at which the galaxy population changes from actively star forming at lower stellar mass to typically quiescent at higher masses .",
    "the break mass is evolving with redshift according to @xmath220 .",
    "we directly show that a relationship between star formation history and galaxy mass holds .",
    "rise time , peak star formation rate , peak time , and post - maximum ( exponential ) decay timescale are all correlated with mass .",
    "more massive galaxies have steeper early onsets of star formation , their peak star formation occurs earlier and is higher , and the following exponential decay has a shorter @xmath13-folding time .",
    "we then present a method to infer effective merger rates ( or mass accretion rates ) from observations of the galaxy stellar mass function and the star formation rate as a function of mass and time .",
    "we quantify the evolution of the mass function due to the star formation activity of galaxies .",
    "we compare this evolution to the observed time derivative of the mass function and interpret any difference between the two as due to changes in galaxy mass due to external causes ; accretion and merging are dominant among such processes .",
    "we introduce and analyze a quantity that we call the _ assembly rate _ , which is defined as the change in number density of galaxies due to accretion and merging .",
    "we observe sufficient star formation to explain the increase in number density at high mass and high redshift . as an upper limit , at most 0.8 effective major mergers per gyr are consistent with the data .",

    "the assembly rate then increases , such that at low @xmath15 , merging becomes the dominant process that increases the number density at masses @xmath7 .",
    "a growth of 0.1  0.2  gyr@xmath18 is consistent with our data at @xmath221 .",
    "this is equivalent to about 1 effective major merger per object in the redshift range @xmath20 .    synthesizing the above into a picture of the formation of massive ellipticals",

    "their elliptical morphology may be a consequence of early merging activity given the merger rate that is consistent with our data at high redshift ( @xmath223  gyr@xmath18 ; see above ) .",
    "later , these galaxies may continue to evolve along the red sequence , however during this phase at @xmath191 , not much growth by merging is happening any more ( at most a factor of two in stellar mass ) .    at more moderate masses of @xmath21",

    "the number density of progressively lower mass galaxies starts to increase due to merging .",
    "this is a direct confirmation of the top - down buildup of the red sequence suggested by recent observations ( e.g.@xcite ) and the simultaneous shutdown of star formation in these objects .",
    "the results presented here do depend on some assumptions that we had to make , mainly due to general deficiencies of current observations and more specifically of the dataset we have at hand . assuming that the faint - end slope of the mf does not evolve is consistent with the observations only up to @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "a steeper faint - end slope is possible due to faint objects ( with lower star formation rates than the detected ones ) being missed due to the survey flux limit .",
    "therefore , a steeper faint - end slope of the mf also means a flatter average star formation rate , and hence a larger assembly rate at low masses .",
    "the fitting function one chooses to use to describe the evolution of the mass function also affects the results . for example , a power - law fit to the evolution of @xmath194 constrains the derivative of the mf w.r.t .",
    "time , and thus limits the possible range of assembly rates .",
    "ideally , one would like to have mf data robust enough to be used to measured derivatives directly and avoid the use of fitting formulae entirely .",
    "the choice of a single average value for the sfr at each mass and redshift also affects the results . in reality , galaxies show a range of activity at fixed mass . allowing for such a range of possible values instead of a single number would lend the method more flexibility , but also demands much higher quality star formation data with better - understood selection effects .",
    "the current generation of ongoing large - area surveys offer the possibility to further explore the build up of the red sequence . with a much larger number of red and massive objects",
    ", one could improve on the analysis presented above in various ways . studying merger processes as a function of the environment is one such possibility .",
