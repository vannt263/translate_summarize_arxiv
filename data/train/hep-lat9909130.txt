    "during the last two decades several models have been developed to describe the basic properties of qcd , quark confinement and chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the most popular are the dual superconductor , leading to confinement , and the instanton liquid model , which explains chiral symmetry breaking and solves the @xmath0 problem @xcite .",
    "both models rely on the existence of topological excitations , monopoles and instantons .",
    "instantons have integer topological charge @xmath1 which is associated with the homotopy group @xmath2 , in four - dimensional euclidian space .",
    "it is related to the zero eigenvalues of the massless dirac operator @xmath3 via the atiyah - singer index theorem @xcite : @xmath4 where @xmath5 @xmath6 is the number of zero - modes of positive ( negative ) chirality .",
    "apart from this famous connection of topology and fermionic degrees of freedom , here we attempt to systematically shed light on the relationship between the sea - quark distribution and topological density .",
    "we do this by studying correlators of topological densities with fermionic observables of the form @xmath7 with @xmath8 .",
    "those quantities are usually referred to as the quark condensate , quark charge density , and the chiral density .",
    "recently , it was demonstrated that monopole currents which constitute a different topological excitation of compact su(3 ) gauge theory , related to the homotopy group @xmath9 , appear preferably in the regions of non - vanishing topological charge density @xcite .",
    "it has been discussed that both instantons and monopoles are related to chiral symmetry breaking @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that zero - modes do not appear in configurations which are not monopole dominated . here , by interpreting the correlators of monopole densities and fermionic operators , we confirm the local interrelation of monopole and fermionic degrees of freedom .",
    "for the implementation of the topological charge on the lattice there exists no unique discretization . in this work",
    "we restrict ourselves to the so - called field theoretic definitions which approximate the topological charge in the continuum , @xmath10 in the following ways @xcite : @xmath11 with @xmath12 for the plaquette prescription and @xmath13 for the hypercube prescription .",
    "we mention here that the topological charges employed are locally gauge invariant , whereas the monopole currents are not .",
    "the lattice and continuum versions of the theory represent different renormalized quantum field theories , which differ by finite , non - negligible renormalization factors .",
    "a simple procedure to get rid of renormalization constants , while preserving physical information contained in lattice configurations , is the cooling method .",
    "the cooling procedure systematically reduces quantum fluctuations , and suppresses differences between the different definitions of the topological charge . in our investigation",
    "we have employed the so - called `` cabibbo  marinari method '' which consists in a local minimization of the gluonic action in the su(2 ) subgroups of su(3 ) @xcite .    in order to investigate monopole currents one has to project @xmath14 onto its abelian degrees of freedom , such that an abelian @xmath15 theory remains @xcite .",
    "this aim can be achieved by various gauge fixing procedures .",
    "we employ the so - called maximum abelian gauge which is most favorable for our purposes . for the definition of the monopole currents @xmath16 we use the standard method @xcite",
    ". to extract abelian parallel transporters @xmath17 after imposing the maximum abelian gauge one has to perform the decomposition @xmath18    with @xmath19    @xmath20 \\ , \\ ] ]    @xmath21 \\ , \\ ] ]    @xmath22 \\ .\\ ] ]    since the maximum abelian subgroup @xmath23 is compact , there exist topological excitations .",
    "these are color magnetic monopoles which have integer - valued magnetic currents on the links of the dual lattice : @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes a product of abelian links @xmath26 around a plaquette @xmath27 and @xmath28 is an elementary cube perpendicular to the @xmath29 direction with origin @xmath30 .",
    "the magnetic currents form closed loops on the dual lattice as a consequence of monopole current conservation . from the monopole currents we define the local monopole density as @xmath31    the local quark condensate",
    "@xmath32 is a diagonal element of the inverse of the fermionic matrix of the qcd action .",
    "other fermionic operators are obtained by inserting the euclidian @xmath33 and @xmath34 matrices .",
    "we compute correlation functions between two observables @xmath35 and @xmath36 @xmath37 since topological objects with opposite sign are equally distributed , we correlate the quark condensate with the square of the topological charge density , and similarly for the other quantities .",
    "our simulations were performed for full su(3 ) qcd on an @xmath38 lattice with ( anti ) periodic boundary conditions for the ( fermionic ) gluonic sector . applying a standard metropolis algorithm",
    ", we checked that tunneling between sectors of different topological charges occurs at reasonable rates .",
    "dynamical quarks in kogut - susskind discretization with @xmath39 flavors of degenerate mass @xmath40 were taken into account using the pseudofermionic method with 40 updates for the production runs .",
    "we performed runs in the confinement phase at inverse gluon coupling @xmath41 , corresponding to a lattice spacing @xmath42 fm .",
    "this leads to a total extension of the lattice of @xmath43 fm and an energy unit of @xmath44 gev .",
    "measurements were taken on 2000 configurations separated by 50 sweeps .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     we display the positive / negative topological charge density by white / black dots if the absolute value exceeds certain minimal fluctuations .",
    "monopole currents are defined in the maximum abelian projection and only one type is shown by lines .",
    "the left 3d plot includes the local chiral condensate @xmath45 , indicated by light grey dots whenever a certain threshold is exceeded .",
    "one clearly sees that both the instanton and antiinstanton are surrounded by a cloud of @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "the middle 3d plot exhibits the situation for the quark charge density @xmath47 indicated by light and dark grey dots depending on the sign of the net color charge excess .",
    "one observes that @xmath47 alternates in sign already in one instanton implying trivial correlations @xmath48 ( not shown in fig .",
    "1 ) . the right 3d plot displays the chiral density @xmath49 again indicated by light and dark grey dots .",
    "one nicely sees that the positive instanton is always surrounded by a lump with @xmath50 and vice versa .",
    "combining the finding of fig .  1 and 2 showing that the correlation functions between fermionic and topological quantities are not very sensitive to cooling together with the 3d images in fig .  3 , we conclude that instantons go hand in hand with clusters of @xmath51 , @xmath52 , also in the uncooled qcd vacuum . in summary , our calculations of correlation functions between topological densities and the fermionic observables exhibit exponential behavior .",
    "results for the condensate and the modulus of the quark charge correlators are almost identical , as expected , since the quark condensate reflects the absolute value of the quark charge density .",
    "these correlation functions show little cooling dependence .",
    "the correlations unambiguously demonstrate that not only the local chiral condensate @xmath45 but also the quark charge @xmath53 and chiral density @xmath49 take non - vanishing values predominantly in the regions of instantons and monopole loops .",
    "note that for the chiral density this behavior is expected due to the anomaly .",
    "visualization exhibited that the distribution of sea - quarks is drastically enhanced around centers of nontrivial topology ( instantons , monopoles ) in euclidian space - time .",
    "our investigations of full qcd with dynamical quarks rely on lattices of spatial volume of @xmath54 with a relatively large lattice constant of @xmath55 fm .",
    "the correlation functions were also computed in the off - axes directions and show little anisotropy effects .",
    "this restauration of rotational invariance is usually taken as a sign of set - in of asymptotic scaling @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it must be emphasized that our results represent the situation on a finite lattice with finite quark mass without the extrapolation to the thermodynamic and chiral limit .",
    "however , since all such correlators turned out rather independent of the gauge group and choice of the action etc . , we expect that they are generic .",
    "we are currently studying fermionic observables along individual monopole trajectories , to further shed light on the puzzle how far monopoles are involved in chiral symmetry breaking",
