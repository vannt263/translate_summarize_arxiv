    "clusters consisting of some 10@xmath0 to 10@xmath1 atoms , which can be produced for instance in the course of the condensation of vapour , have attracted great interest during the last 20 years .",
    "these  mesoscopic  clusters were found to exhibit classical as well as quantum mechanical features . in the special case of metallic clusters @xcite ,",
    "the conduction electrons , which move in the average potential produced by the positively charged ions , exhibit shell effects . as a consequence ,",
    "the binding energy of the cluster becomes a function of the number of free electrons ( and thus also of the number of ions ) . in turn , this implies measurable variations of the formation probability of a cluster as a function of its mass in a thermal vapour - gas equilibrium .",

    ", we consider a mesoscopic system which consists of a spherical metallic core of radius @xmath2 carrying @xmath3 positive charges and surrounded by an insulating layer of external radius @xmath4 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "we determine analytically the bound states of a single electron in the potential @xmath5 which is produced by the positive surface charge density of the metallic core and the insulating dielectric surface layer . as in the case of an ordinary atom , these single electron wave functions describe also approximately the case that several electrons are bound in this potential . for @xmath3 bound electrons ,",
    "the system has total charge 0 .",
    "because of the obvious similarity of this system with an atom or ion , we refer to it as a  mesoscopic atom  or  mesoscopic ion  .",
    "as one can surmise , there are two different types of bound electronic states : electrons localized in the metallic core inside of the insulating layer ( region ii , fig .  1 ) and electrons localized in the vacuum outside of the insulating layer ( region 0 , fig .  1 ) .",
    "the bound states localized outside are reminiscent of the bound states of an electron in the coulomb potential of the atomic nucleus .",
    "we are mainly interested in these externally localized electronic states (  class 1-states  ) and their decay into lower - lying bound states predominantly localized within the metallic core (  class 2-states  ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :    in sec .  2",
    ", we formulate the single - particle hamiltonian and determine the eigenfunctions and eigenenergies of bound electrons .",
    "in doing so , we take into account the polarization of the insulating surface layer which is produced by the uniform positive charge distribution on the surface @xmath6 of the metal , but we neglect the additional polarization effects produced by the externally localized electrons .    in sec .",
    "3 we determine these additional polarization effects within the classical maxwellian electrodynamics .",
    "they lead to an additional potential acting on the electrons which is of importance close to the surface @xmath7 of the insulator .",
    "so far , we have not yet studied the effect of this additional potential on the externally localized electrons .",
    "the sec .  4",
    "is dedicated to a presentation of the results . in subsec .",
    "4.1 , we describe the procedure which we used in order to obtain the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions and we present typical examples of spectra and wavefunctions . in subsec .  4.2",
    ", we discuss the electromagnetic decay of a predominantly externally localized bound electron into a lower - lying internally localized state .",
    "we show that the transition rate and the corresponding life - time may vary by several orders of magnitude depending on the parameters of the system .",
    "in general , the transition is hindered by the small overlap between externally and internally localized states (  class  1-states  and  class  2-states  ) if the insulating surface layer is sufficiently thick .",
    "in particular , we discuss the special role in this decay of  class 3-states  which exhibit non - negligible amplitudes both in the external region 0 and the internal region ii .    finally , in sec . 5 , we summarize the results and discuss some related open questions .",

    "on the other hand , the average energy gap above the fermi level in the insulator may act upon the electron like a repulsive barrier of a height @xmath22 .",
    "last not least , there are polarization effects produced by the positive surplus charge and also by the charge distribution @xmath23 of the externally ( i.e. predominantly in region 0 ) localized electrons .",

    "of course , this is much more complicated and , to our knowledge , it has rarely been done so far for mesoscopic systems .",
    "furthermore , the crystal structure in mesoscopic aggregates is in general poorly known .    as a result",
    ", the electronic eigenvalues of the total system are expected to exhibit a band structure similarly to a macroscopic solid , the insulating surface layer being characterized by a completely filled valence band and an empty conduction band .",
    "the empty conduction band in the insulator can be at negative or at positive energy if the energy of the neutral system plus one electron at infinity is put equal to 0 .",
    "describing the average potential in the insulator by a positive barrier @xmath22 is only meaningful if the conduction band of the insulator is at positive energy .    as a further restrictive condition for our model to be a reasonable 1@xmath332 approximation there should be no localized traps for an additional electron in the uncharged insulator",
    "this implies that the individual atoms or molecules of the insulator should not have bound states with an additional electron as a monomer @xcite . in general , bound states of an electron with a neutral atom or molecule do not exist for atoms or molecules with completely filled shells .",

    "presumably , al@xmath670@xmath333 fulfills this condition . finally , we neglected effects of the electron - phonon coupling altogether .",

    "as long as one can only produce a limited number of  mesoscopic atoms  , one could just investigate experimentally the effects which we studied in the present paper , especially the amusing strong dependence of the lifetime on the radius and the charge of the metallic core .",
    "although we would be highly pleased by an experimental scrutiny of our predictions , still more exciting open questions could be asked , if it were possible to produce longlived systems of the kind we presented in this paper , and in large quantities . in this case",
    ", one would have access to the study of molecules formed from mesoscopic atoms and to condensed matter consisting of mesoscopic atoms as building blocks .",
    "the presence of externally localized electrons would represent a fundamental difference from the case of a condensed system of uncharged mesoscopic clusters .",
    "on the one hand , one may expect that , in a condensed matter phase of mesoscopic atoms , the weakly bound external electrons would partly dissociate from their mother atoms and move freely in the average field produced by the charged insulated cores .",
    "we would thus surmise that such a system would be a ( good ) conductor . on the other hand",
    ", the fact that the building blocks of such a condensed matter carry charge , will have a profound influence on the equilibrium state of the material .",
    "probably , its density is lower than for uncharged constituents , where the cohesive forces are of van der waals type and , consequently , of much shorter range .",
    "as we learnt from this paper , a mesoscopic system of the kind we investigated can only be stable in a strict sense , if there is no empty internally located electronic state below the energy of the lowest externally located state which is at an energy slightly above @xmath335 .",

    "it is therefore conceivable that one might succeed to model a strictly stable , , mesoscopic atom  .    a further trick to widen the spectrum of internally localized electrons would be to replace the metallic sphere with radius @xmath2 by a metallic bubble of outer radius @xmath2 and a thickness of 1    to 2  ",
    "in this case the levels differing by the number of radial nodes would have a much larger spacing .",
    "this is perhaps possible , if one replaces the charged metal layer by a ( charged ) fullerene @xmath352 , which has a radius of about 3,5   .",
