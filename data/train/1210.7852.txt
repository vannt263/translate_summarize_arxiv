    "the recent fabulous discovery by atlas and cms of a higgs - like resonance at 125 gev@xcite adds credence to supersymmetric models ( susy ) of particle physics in that the mass value falls squarely within the narrow predicted mssm window : @xmath5 gev@xcite . at the same time , a lack of a susy signal at lhc7 and lhc8 implies squarks and gluinos beyond the 1 tev range@xcite , exacerbating the _ little hierarchy problem _ ( lhp ) :    how do multi - tev values of susy model parameters conspire to yield a @xmath6-boson mass of just 91.2 gev",
    "? models of _ natural supersymmetry_@xcite address the lhp by positing a spectrum of light higgsinos @xmath0 gev and light top squarks @xmath1 gev along with very heavy first / second generation squarks and tev - scale gluinos@xcite .",
    "such a spectrum allows for low electroweak finetuning while at the same time keeping sparticles safely beyond lhc search limits . in these models , the radiative corrections to @xmath2 , which increase with @xmath7 ,",
    "are somewhat suppressed and have great difficulty in generating a light susy higgs scalar with mass @xmath8 gev@xcite .",
    "thus , we are faced with a new conundrum : how do we reconcile low electroweak finetuning with such a large value of @xmath2@xcite ?",
    "in addition , the light higgsino - like wimp particles predicted by models of natural susy lead to a thermally - generated relic density which is typically a factor 10 - 15 below@xcite the wmap measured value of @xmath9 .    one solution to the finetuning / higgs problem is to add extra matter to the theory , thus moving beyond the mssm@xcite . for example , adding an extra singlet as in the nmssm adds further quartic terms to the higgs potential thus allowing for increased values of @xmath2@xcite .",
    "one may also add extra vector - like matter to increase @xmath2 while maintaining light top squarks@xcite .",
    "in the former case of the nmssm , adding extra gauge singlets may lead to re - introduction of destabilizing divergences into the theory@xcite . in the latter case",
    ", one might wonder about the ad - hoc introduction of extra weak scale matter multiplets and how they might have avoided detection a third possibility , which is presented below , is to re - examine ewft and to ascertain if there do exist sparticle spectra _ within the mssm _ that lead to @xmath8 gev while maintaining modest levels of electroweak finetuning .",
    "one way to evaluate ewft in susy models is to examine the minimization condition on the higgs sector scalar potential which determines the @xmath6 boson mass .",
    "( equivalently , one may examine the mass formula for @xmath2 and draw similar conclusions . )",
    "one obtains the well - known tree - level expression = -^2 .",
    "[ eq : treemin ] to obtain a _",
    "natural _ value of @xmath10 on the left - hand - side , one would like each term @xmath11 ( with @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) on the right - hand - side to be of order @xmath14 .",
    "this leads to a finetuning parameter definition max_i ( c_i)/(m_z^2/2 ) where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "since @xmath18 is suppressed by @xmath19 , for even moderate @xmath20 values this expression reduces approximately to -m_h_u^2-^2 .",
    "[ eq : approx ] the question then arises : what is the model , what are the input parameters , and how do we interpret eq s [ eq : treemin ] and [ eq : approx ] ?",
    "suppose we have a model with input parameters defined at some high scale @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the susy breaking scale @xmath23 tev .",
    "then m_h_u^2(m_susy)=m_h_u^2()+m_h_u^2 where m_h_u^2-(m_q_3 ^ 2+m_u_3 ^ 2+a_t^2 ) ( ) .",
    "the usual lore is that in a model defined at energy scale @xmath24 , then both @xmath25 and @xmath26 must be of order @xmath14 in order to avoid finetuning .",
    "in fact , requiring @xmath27 has been used to argue for a sparticle mass spectra of natural susy .",
    "taking @xmath28 corresponds to    * @xmath29 , * @xmath30 , * @xmath31 .",
    "since first / second generation squarks and sleptons hardly enter into eq .",
    "[ eq : treemin ] , these can be much heavier : beyond lhc reach and also possibly providing a ( partial ) decoupling solution to the susy flavor and cp problems :    * @xmath32 tev .",
    "the natural susy solution reconciles lack of a susy signal at lhc with allowing for electroweak naturalness .",
    "it also predicts that the @xmath33 and @xmath34 may soon be accessible to lhc searches .",
    "new limits from direct top and bottom squark pair production searches , interpreted within the context of simplified models , are biting into the ns parameter space@xcite .",
    "of course , if @xmath35 , then the visible decay products from stop and sbottom production will be soft and difficult to see at lhc .",
    "a more worrisome problem is that , with such light top squarks , the radiative corrections to @xmath2 are not large enough to yield @xmath36 gev .",
    "this problem has been used to argue that additional multiplets beyond those of the mssm must be present in order to raise up @xmath2 while maintaining very light third generation squarks@xcite .",
    "a third issue is that the relic abundance of higgsino - like wimps , calculated in the standard mssm - only cosmology , is typically a factor 10 - 15 below measured values .",
    "these issues have led some people to grow increasingly skeptical of weak scale susy , even as occurs in the natural susy incarnation .",
    "one resolution to the above finetuning problem is to merely invoke a susy particle spectrum at the weak scale , as in the pmssm model . here , @xmath37 so @xmath38 and we may select parameters @xmath39 . while a logical possibility , this solution avoids the many attractive features of a model which is valid up to a high scale such as @xmath40 , with gauge coupling unification and radiative electroweak symmetry breaking driven by a large top quark mass .",
    "another resolution is to impose eq .",
    "[ eq : treemin ] as a condition on high scale models , but using only weak scale parameters . in this case",
    ", we will differentiate the finetuning measure as @xmath41 , while the finetuning measure calculated using high scale input parameters we will refer to as @xmath42 . the weaker condition of allowing only for @xmath43 allows for possible _ cancellations _ in @xmath44 .",
    "this is precisely what happens in what is known as the hyperbolic branch or focus point region of msugra@xcite : @xmath45 and consequently a value of @xmath46 is chosen to enforce the measured value of @xmath47 from eq .",
    "[ eq : treemin ] .",
    "the hb / fp region of msugra occurs for small values of trilinear soft parameter @xmath48 .",
    "small @xmath48 leads to small @xmath49 at the weak scale , which leads to @xmath50 gev , well below the atlas / cms measured value of @xmath36 gev .",
    "scans over parameter space show the hb / fp region is nearly excluded if one requires both low @xmath51 and @xmath52 gev@xcite .",
    "the cancellation mechanism can also be seen from an approximate analytic solution of the ewsb minimation by kane _",
    "et al._@xcite : m_z^2&=&-1.8 ^ 2 + 5.9 m_3 ^ 2- 0.4m_2 ^ 2 - 1.2m_h_u^2 + 0.9 m_q_3 ^ 2 + & & + 0.7 m_u_3 ^ 2 -0.6a_tm_3 + 0.4 m_2m_3+(which adopts @xmath53 although similar expressions may be gained for other @xmath20 values ) .",
    "all parameters on the rhs are gut scale parameters .",
    "we see one solution for obtaining @xmath47 on the left - hand side is to have all gut scale parameters of order @xmath47 ( this is now excluded by recent lhc limits ) .",
    "the other possibility if some terms are large ( like @xmath54 tev in accord with recent lhc limits) is to have large cancellations . the simplest possibility using @xmath54 tev is then to raise up @xmath55 beyond @xmath56 such that there is a large cancellation .",
    "this possibility is allowed in the non - universal higgs models@xcite .    in msugra , the condition that @xmath57 at the high scale is anyways hard to accept .",
    "one might expect that all matter scalars in each generation are nearly degenerate since the known matter in each generation fills out complete 16-dimensional representations of @xmath58 . however , the distinguishing feature of the higgs multiplets is that they would live in 10-dimensional representations , and we then would _ not _",
    "expect @xmath59 at @xmath60 .",
    "a more likely choice would be to move to the non - universal higgs model , which comes in several varieties .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that by adopting a simple one - parameter extension of msugra known as the one extra parameter non - universal higgs model ( nuhm1 ) , with parameter space m_h_u^2=m_h_d^2m_^2 ,  m_0 ,  m_1/2 ,  a_0 ,  ,  sign ( )  then for any spectra one may raise @xmath61 up beyond @xmath56 until at some point @xmath44 drops in magnitude to @xmath62 .",
    "the ewsb minimization condition then also forces @xmath51 .",
    "the worst of the ewft is eliminated due to a large cancellation between @xmath63 and @xmath26 leading to low @xmath41 and a model which enjoys electroweak naturalness .",
    "the cancellation obviously can also be implemented in the 2-extra - parameter model nuhm2 where both @xmath64 and @xmath65 may be taken as free parameters ( as in an @xmath66 susy gut ) or using the ewsb minimization conditions these may be traded for weak scale values of @xmath13 and @xmath67 as alternative inputs@xcite . a third possibility that will allow for an improved decoupling solution to the susy flavor and cp problems would occur if we allow for split generations",
    "@xmath68 and @xmath69 ( sgnuhm ) .",
    "the latter condition need not require exact degeneracy , since with @xmath70 tev we obtain only a _ partial _ decoupling solution to the flavor problem . taking @xmath71 tev",
    "solves the susy cp problem@xcite .",
    "motivated by the possibility of cancellations occuring in @xmath44 , we go back to the ewsb minimization condition and augment it with radiative corrections @xmath72 and @xmath73 since if @xmath55 and @xmath74 are suppressed , then these may dominate : = -^2 .",

    "once we are in parameter space where @xmath89 , then the radiative corrections @xmath72 may give the largest contribution to @xmath41 .",

    "<S> models of natural supersymmetry seek to solve the little hierarchy problem by positing a spectrum of light higgsinos @xmath0 gev and light top squarks @xmath1 gev along with very heavy squarks and tev - scale gluinos . </S>",
    "<S> such models have low electroweak finetuning and are safe from lhc searches . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the context of the mssm , they predict too low a value of @xmath2 and the relic density of thermally produced higgsino - like wimps falls well below dark matter ( dm ) measurements . allowing for high scale soft susy breaking higgs mass @xmath3 leads to natural _ cancellations _ during rg running , and to radiatively induced _ </S>",
    "<S> low finetuning at the electroweak scale_. this model of _ radiative natural susy _ ( rns ) , with large mixing in the top squark sector , allows for finetuning at the 5 - 10% level with tev - scale top squarks and a 125 gev light higgs scalar @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> if the strong cp problem is solved via the pq mechanism , then we expect an axion - higgsino admixture of dark matter , where either or both the dm particles might be directly detected . </S>"
