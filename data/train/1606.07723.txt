    "as is well known , the atom or atoms in the atomic clock are passive  they do not `` tick''so the clock needs an active oscillator in addition to the atom(s ) . in designing an atomic clock to realize the second as a measurement unit in the international system of units ( si ) , one encounters two problems : ( a ) the resonance exhibited by the atom or atoms of the clock varies with the details of the clock s construction and the circumstances of its operation ; in particular the resonance shifts depending on the intensity of the radiation of the atoms by the oscillator .",
    "( b ) the oscillator , controlled by , in effect , a knob , drifts in relation to the knob setting .",
    "problem ( a ) is dealt with by introducing a wave function parametrized by radiation intensity and whatever other factors one deems relevant .",
    "the si second is then `` defined '' by the resonance that `` would be found '' at absolute zero temperature ( implying zero radiation ) . for a clock using cesium 133 atoms ,",
    "this imagined resonance is declared by the general conference of weights and measures to be 9 192 631 770 hz , so that the si second is that number of cycles of the radiation at that imagined resonance @xcite . to express the relation between a measured resonance and the imagined resonance at 0 k",
    ", a wave function is chosen .",
    "problem ( b ) is dealt with by computer - mediated feedback that turns the knob of the oscillator in response to detections of scattering of the oscillator s radiation by the atom(s ) of the clock , steering the oscillator toward an aiming point .",
    "a key point for this paper is that the wave function incorporated into the operation of an atomic clock can never be unconditionally known .",
    "the language of quantum theory reflects within itself a distinction between ` explanation ' and ` evidence ' . for explanations it offers the linear algebra of wave functions and operators , while for evidence it offers probabilities on a set of outcomes .",
    "outcomes are subject to quantum uncertainty , but uncertainty is only the tip of an iceberg : how can one `` know '' that a wave function describes an experimental situation ?",
    "the distinction within quantum theory between linear operators and probabilities implies a gap between any explanation and the evidence explained .",
    "@xcite :    [ prop : one ] to choose a wave function to explain experimental evidence requires reaching beyond logic based on that evidence , and evidence acquired after the choice is made can call for a revision of the chosen wave function .    because no wave function can be unconditionally known ,",
    "not even probabilities of future evidence can be unconditionally foreseen .",
    "here we show implications of the unknowability of wave functions for the second as a unit of measurement in the international system ( si ) , implications that carry over to both digital communications and to the use of a spacetime with a metric tensor in explaining clock readings at the transmission and reception of logical symbols .",
    "clocks that generate universal coordinated time ( utc ) are steered toward aiming points that depend not only on a chosen wave function but also on an hypothesized metric tensor field of a curved spacetime .",
    "like the chosen wave function , the hypothesis of a metric tensor is constrained , but not determined , by measured data .",
    "guesses enter the operations of clocks through the computational machinery that steers them . taking incoming data",
    ", the machinery updates records that determine an aiming point , and so involves the writing and reading of records .",
    "the writing must take place at a phase of a cycle distinct from a phase of reading , with a separation between the writing and the reading needed to avoid a logical short circuit . in sec .",
    "[ sec : turing ] we picture an explanation used in the operation of a clock as a string of characters written on a tape divided into squares , one symbol per square .",
    "the tape is part of a turing machine modified to be stepped by a clock and to communicate with other such machines and with keyboards and displays .",
    "we call this modified turing machine an _ open machine_. the computations performed by an open machine are open to an inflow numbers and formulas incalculable prior to their entry . because a computer cycles through distinct phases of memory use , the most direct propagation of symbols from one computer to another requires a symbol from one computer to arrive during a suitable phase of the receiving computer s cycle . in sec .",
    "[ sec : phasing ] we elevate this phase dependence to a principle that defines the _ logical synchronization _ necessary to a _ channel _ that connects clock readings at transmission of symbols to clock readings at their reception    recognizing the dependence of logic - bearing channels on an interaction between evidence and hypotheses about signal propagation engenders several types of questions , leading to a _ discipline of logical synchronization _ , outlined in sec .",
    "[ sec : patterns ] .",
    "the first type of question concerns patterns of channels that are possible aiming points , as determined in a blackboard calculation that assumes a theory of signal propagation .",
    "[ sec : typei ] addresses examples of constraints on patterns of channels under various hypotheses of spacetime curvature , leading to putting `` phase stripes '' in spacetime that constrain channels to or from a given open machine .",
    "an example of a freedom to guess an explanation within a constraint of evidence is characterized by a subgroup of a group of clock adjustments , and a bound on bit rate is shown to be imposed by variability in spacetime curvature .",
    "[ sec : adj ] briefly addresses the two other types of questions , pertaining not to _ hypothesizing _ possible aiming points ` on the blackboard ' , but to _ using _ hypothesized aiming points , copied into feedback - mediating computers , for the steering of drifting clocks . after discussing steering toward aiming points copied from the blackboard ,",
    "we note occasions that invite revision of a hypothesized metric tensor and of patterns of channels chosen as aiming points .",
    "computer - mediated feedback , especially as used in an atomic clock , requires logic open to an inflow of inputs beyond the reach of calculation . to model the logic of a computer that communicates with the other devices in a feedback loop , we modify a turing machine to communicate with external devices , including other such machines .",
    "the turing machine makes a record on a tape marked into squares , each square holding one character of an alphabet . operating in a sequence of ` moments ' interspersed by ` moves ' , at any moment the machine scans one square of the tape , from which it can read , or onto which it can write , a single character . a move as defined in the mathematics of turing machines consists ( only ) of the logical relation between the machine at one moment and the machine at the next moment @xcite , thus expressing the logic of a computation , detached from its speed ; however , in a feedback loop , computational speed matters .",
    "let the moves of the modified turing machine be stepped by ticks of a clock .",
    "a step occurs once per a period of revolution of the clock hand .",
    "this period is adjustable , on the fly .",
    "we require that the cycle of the modified turing machine correspond to a unit interval of the readings of its clock .    to express communication between open machines as models of computers , the modified turing machine can receive externally supplied signals and can transmit signals , with both the reception and the transmission geared to the cycle of the machine . in addition",
    ", the modified turing machine registers a count of moments at which signals are received and moments at which signals are transmitted . at a finer scale , _ the machine records a phase quantity in the cycle of its clock , relative to the center of the moment at which a signal carrying a character arrives .",
    "_ we call such a machine an _ open machine_. an open machine can receive detections and can command action , for instance the action of increasing or decreasing the frequency of the variable oscillator of an atomic clock .    calculations performed on an open machine communicating with detectors and actuators proceed by moves made according to a rule that can be modified from outside the machine in the course of operation .",
    "these calculations respond to received influences , such as occurrences of outcomes underivable from the contents of the machine memory , when the open machine writes commands on a tape read by an external actuator .",
    "the wider physical world shows up in an open machine as both ( 1 ) unforeseeable messages from external devices and ( 2 ) commands to external devices .",
    "we picture a real - time computer in a feedback loop as writing records on the tape of an open machine .",
    "the segmentation into moments interspersed by moves is found not just in turing machines but in any digital computer , which implies    the logical result of any computation is oblivious to variations in speed at which the clock steps the computer .     + corollary 2.1 .",
    "_ no computer can sense directly any variation in its clock frequency . _",
    "although it can not directly sense variation in the tick rate of its clock , the logic of open machine stepped by an atomic clock can still control the adjustment of the clock s oscillator by responding to variations in the detection rate written moment by moment onto its turing tape .",
    "a flow of unforeseeable detections feeds successive computations of results , each of which , promptly acted on , impacts probabilities of subsequent occurrences of outcomes , even though those subsequent outcomes remain unforeseeable . the computation that steers the oscillator depends not just on unforeseeable inputs , but also on a steering formula encoded in a program .",
    "* remarks * :    1 .   to appreciate feedback ,",
    "take note that a formula is distinct from what it expresses .",
    "for example a formula written along a stretch of a turing tape as a string of characters can contain a name @xmath0 for wave function as a function of time variable @xmath1 and space variables .",
    "the formula , containing @xmath0 , once written , just `` sits motionless , '' in contrast to the motion that the formula expresses . 2 .",
    "although unchanged over some cycles of a feedback loop , a feedback loop operates in a larger context , in which steering formulas are subject to evolution .",
    "sooner or later , the string that defines the action of an algorithm , invoking a formula , is apt to be overwritten by a string of characters expressing a new formula .",
    "occasions for rewriting steering formulas are routine in clock networks , including those employed in geodesy and astronomy .",
    "logical communication requires clocking .",
    "the reading of a clock of an open machine @xmath2an @xmath2-reading  has the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 indicates the count of cycles and @xmath5 is the phase within the cycle , with the convention that @xmath6 .",
    "we define a channel from @xmath2 to @xmath7 , denoted @xmath8 , as a set of pairs , each pair of the form @xmath9 .",
    "the first member @xmath3 is an @xmath2-reading at which machine @xmath2 can transmit a signal and @xmath10 is a @xmath7-reading at which the clock of machine @xmath7 can register the reception of the signal . define a _ repeating channel _ to be a channel @xmath8 such that @xmath11)(\\exists m , n , j , k ) ( m+\\ell j.\\phi_{a,\\ell},n+\\ell k.\\phi_{b,\\ell } ) ] \\in \\abr,\\ ] ] for theoretical purposes , it is convenient to define an _ endlessly repeating channel _ for which @xmath12 ranges over all integers .",
    "again for theoretical purposes , on occasion we consider channels for which the phases are all zero , in which case we may omit writing the phases .    because they are defined by local clocks without reference to any metric tensor",
    ", channels invoke no assumption about a metric or even a spacetime manifold .",
    "for this reason evidence from the operation of channels is independent of any explanatory assumptions involving a manifold with metric and , in particular , is independent of any global time coordinate , or any `` reference system '' @xcite .",
    "thus clock readings at the transmission and the reception of signals can prompt revisions of hypotheses about a metric tensor field . a record format for such evidence was illustrated in earlier work @xcite , along with the picturing of such records as _ occurrence graphs_.    from the beating of a heart to the bucket brigade , life moves in phased rhythms . for a symbol carried by a signal from an open machine @xmath2 to be written into the memory of an open machine @xmath7 , the signal must be available at @xmath7 within a phase of the cycle of @xmath7 during which writing can take place , and the cycle must offer room for a distinct other phase .",
    "we elevate engineering commonplace to a principle pertaining to open machines as follows .",
    "[ prop : three ] a logical symbol can propagate from one open machine to another only if the symbol arrives within the writing phase of the receiving machine ; in particular , respect for phasing requires that for some positive @xmath13 any arrival phase @xmath14 satisfy the inequality @xmath15    prop .",
    "[ prop : three ] serves as a fixed point to hold onto while hypotheses about signal propagation in relation to channels are subject to revision .",
    "we call the phase constraint on a channel asserted by ( [ eq : main ] ) _ logical synchronization_. for simplicity and to allow comparing conditions for phasing with conditions for einstein synchronization , we take the engineering liberty of allowing transmission to occur at the same phase as reception , so that both occur during a phase interval satisfying ( [ eq : main ] ) . the alternative of demanding reception near values of @xmath16 can be carried out with little extra difficulty . +",
    "* remarks : *    1 .   note that @xmath14 in the proposition is a phase of a cycle of a variable - rate clock that is _ not _ assumed to be in any fixed relation to a proper clock as conceived in general relativity . indeed , satisfying ( [ eq : main ] ) usually requires the operation of clocks at variable rates .",
    "the engineering of communications between computers commonly detaches the timing of a computer s receiver from that of the computer by buffering : after a reception , the receiver writes into a buffer that is later read by the computer@xcite . in analyzing open machines we do without buffering , confining ourselves to character - by - character phase meshing as asserted in prop .",
    "[ prop : three ] , which offers the most direct communication possible .",
    "given the definition of a channel and the condition ( [ eq : main ] ) essential to the communication of logical symbols , three types of questions arise :    * type i : * what patterns of interrelated channels does one try for as aiming points ?",
    "* type ii : * how can the steering of open machines be arranged to approach given aiming points within acceptable phase tolerances ?",
    "* type iii : * how to respond to deviations from aiming points beyond tolerances ?",
    "such questions point the way to exploring what might be called a _ discipline of logical synchronization_. so far we notice two promising areas of application within this discipline :    1 .",
    "provide a theoretical basis for networks of logically synchronized repeating channels , highlighting 1 .",
    "possibilities for channels with null receptive phases as a limiting case of desirable behavior , and 2 .",
    "circumstances that force non - null phases . 2 .",
    "explore constraints on receptive phases imposed by gravitation , as a path to exploring and measuring gravitational curvature , including slower changes in curvature than those searched for by the laser gravitational wave observatory @xcite .",
    "answers to questions of the above types require hypotheses , if only provisional , about signal propagation . for this section",
    "we assume that propagation is described by null geodesics in a lorentzian 4-manifold @xmath17 with one or another metric tensor field @xmath18 , as in general relativity .",
    "following perlick @xcite we represent an open machine as a timelike worldline , meaning a smooth embedding @xmath19 from a real interval into @xmath17 , such that the tangent vector @xmath20 is everywhere timelike with respect to @xmath18 and future - pointing .",
    "we limit our attention to worldlines of open machines that allow for signal propagation between them to be expressed by null geodesics .",
    "to say this more carefully , we distinguish the _ image _ of a worldline as a submanifold of @xmath17 from the worldline as a mapping .",
    "consider an open region @xmath21 of @xmath17 containing a smaller open region @xmath22 , with @xmath21 containing the images of two open machines @xmath2 and @xmath7 , with the property that every point @xmath23 of the image of @xmath2 restricted to @xmath22 is reached uniquely by one future - pointing null geodesic from the image of @xmath7 in @xmath21 and by one past - pointing null geodesic from the image of @xmath7 in @xmath21 .",
    "we then say @xmath2 and @xmath7 are _ radar linkable _ in @xmath22 .",
    "we limit our attention to open machines that are radar linkable in some spacetime region @xmath22 .",
    "in addition we assume that the channels preserve order ( what is transmitted later arrives later ) .",
    "indeed , we mostly deal with open machines in a gently curved spacetime region , adequately described by fermi normal coordinates around a timelike geodesic .    for simplicity and to allow comparing conditions for phasing with conditions for einstein synchronization ,",
    "we take the liberty of allowing transmission to occur at the same phase as reception , so that both occur during a phase interval satisfying ( [ eq : main ] ) .",
    "the perhaps more realistic alternative of demanding reception near values of @xmath16 can be carried out with little difficulty .    to develop the physics of channels ,",
    "we need to introduce three concepts :    \\(1 ) we define a _ group of clock adjustments _ as transformations of the readings of the clock of an open machine .",
    "as it pertains to endlessly repeating channels , a group @xmath24 of clock adjustments consists of functions on the real numbers having continuous , positive first derivatives .",
    "group multiplication is the composition of such functions , which , being invertible , have inverses . to define the action of @xmath24 on clock readings , we speak ` original clock readings ' as distinct from adjusted readings an adjustment @xmath25 acts by changing every original reading @xmath26 of a clock @xmath2 to an adjusted reading @xmath27 .",
    "as we shall see , clock adjustments can affect echo counts .",
    "\\(2 ) to hypothesize a relation between the @xmath2-clock and an accompanying proper clock , one has to assume one or another metric tensor field @xmath18 , relative to which to define proper time increments along @xmath2 s worldline ; then one can posit an adjustment @xmath28 such that @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the reading imagined for the accompanying proper clock when @xmath2 reads @xmath26 .",

    "evidence in the form of an echo count becomes explained , under the assumption of a metric tensor field @xmath18 , as being just twice the radar distance @xcite from @xmath2 to the event of reception by @xmath7 .",
    "questions of type i concern constraints on channels imposed by the physics of signal propagation . here",
    "we specialize to constraints on channels imposed by spacetime metrics , constraints obtained from mathematical models that , while worked out so to speak on the blackboard , can be copied onto turing tapes as aiming points toward which to steer the behavior of the clocks of open machines .",
    "questions of types ii and iii are deferred to the sec .",
    "[ sec : adj ] .",
    "we begin by considering just two machines . assuming an hypothetical spacetime @xmath32 ,",

    "note that the image of @xmath7 , and not just its clock rate , depend on the clock rate of @xmath2 .",
    "determination of the tick events for @xmath7 leaves undetermined the @xmath7 trajectory between ticks , so there is a freedom of choice .",
