    "at the existing vepp2 m @xmath5 collider and planned meson factories qed processes of the lowest order of the perturbation theory ( pt ) play an important role .",
    "these processes are to be considered as an essential background when extracting subtle mesons properties from experimental data .",
    "qed processes are used also for calibration and monitoring purposes .",
    "for instance , large ",
    "angle bhabha scattering is used for a precise determination of luminosity at @xmath5 colliders .",
    "that is the reason , why radiative corrections ( rc ) to qed processes are to be considered in detail .",
    "a lot of attention was paid to the problem of radiative correction calculations to various qed processes , starting more than 50 years ago  @xcite , concerning mainly the lowest order of pt calculations .",
    "the accuracy requirements of modern experiments , however , exceed the ones provided by the first order rc .",
    "unfortunately , calculations of radiative corrections in higher orders encounter tremendous technical difficulties .",
    "nevertheless , powerful methods developed in quantum chromodynamics ( see paper  @xcite and references therein ) provide a possibility to improve essentially the results obtained earlier . at first we mean the methods based on the renormalization group ideas and on the factorization theorem .",
    "thay allow us to get a differential cross ",
    "section of a certain process similar to the drell  yan process cross  section , and to consider leading logarithmic rc of higher orders .",
    "meanwhile , nonleading contributions are to be taken from the lowest order pt calculations .",
    "the aim of our paper is to provide relevant theoretical formulae for qed processes , which are required for experiments with cmd2 and snd detectors at vepp2 m ( novosibirsk )  @xcite collider , at da@xmath6ne ( frascati )  @xcite and bepc / bes ( beijing )  @xcite machines .",
    "formulae cited below may be applied also for higher energies ( see the conclusions ) , if one will take into account weak interaction and higher hadronic resonance contributions .",
    "a cross  section calculated with an account of radiative corrections ( rc ) in the @xmath7-th order of perturbation theory ( pt ) contains enhanced contributions of the form @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the _",

    "the terms , proportional to @xmath8 , can be calculated by means of the structure function method  @xcite .",

    "fortunately , this second order nonleading rc are small : @xmath20 .",
    "so , the presented formulae guarantee theoretical precision of the order @xmath21 . considering hard photon emission in the first order of pt",
    "we distinguish the contributions due to the initial state radiation , the final state radiation , and their interference .",
    "the first one always contains large logarithms .",
    "the ones due to the final state radiation as well as the initial ",
    "final state interference do not enhance the corrections considerably , except the case of bhabha scattering . in the case of hard photon radiation",
    "large logarithms come from kinematical regions , where the photona are emitted along electron and positron beams",
