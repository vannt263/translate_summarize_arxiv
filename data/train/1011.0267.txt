    "the conductivity of a conductor - insulator composite material is characterized by a strong dependence on the volume fraction @xmath4 of the conducting phase present in the system , and is generally understood as a percolation phenomenon arising from the electrical connectivity between neighboring or adjacent conducting particles .",
    "specifically , percolation theory considers the conducting particles as either electrically connected , with some finite inter - particle conductance , or disconnected.@xcite the introduction of this sharp cut - off implies then that below a specific fraction @xmath5 ( the percolation threshold ) the conductivity is zero because there is no sample - spanning network of connected particles , while for @xmath6 such network is formed and the conductivity increases as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a critical exponent .",
    "it is easy to see that the notion of a sharp cut - off applies well to composites made of large ( of the order of one micron or more ) conducting particles , for which two particles can be considered electrically connected only if they essentially touch each other , it is less clear for the case in which the conducting particles have sizes limited to a few nanometers.@xcite in that situation even if the particles do not physically touch each other , their mean separation in the composite is such that electrons can still flow via tunneling processes from one particle to the other .",
    "the resulting tunneling conductance decays exponentially with the inter - particle distance over a characteristic tunneling length @xmath2 which is of the order of a fraction to a few nanometers depending on the material properties .",
    "since the tunneling decay does not imply any sharp cut - off , the basic assumption of percolation theory in describing composites made of nanometric conducting fillers is not justified a priori .",
    "in fact , it turns out that nanocomposites in the dielectric regime , for which the conducting particles do not touch each other , are better explained by inter - particle tunneling , with no imposed sharp connectivity criterion , than by the classical percolation theory.@xcite the resulting conductivities of these systems follow therefore hopping - like ( or tunneling - like ) behaviors,@xcite with no critical percolation thresholds as a function of @xmath4 .    the possibility of having percolation - like or tunneling - like regimes depending on the size @xmath1 of the conducting particles compared to the tunneling length @xmath2 , as suggested above and in ref .",
    "[ ] , does not appear to have been further elaborated in the literature , despite of its relevance to the understanding of transport properties in conductor - insulator composites . in the present paper",
    "we address this issue by considering a global tunneling network ( gtn ) model of conductor - insulator composites,@xcite where each conducting particle is connected to all others via tunneling processes .",
    "we show that this model permits to treat the percolation and the tunneling regimes on equal footing , and that one can switch from one regime to the other depending not only on @xmath0 but , most notably , also on the specific distribution of the conducting phase in the composite .",
    "we illustrate this behavior by considering two idealized realizations of conductor - insulator composites : a lattice model , where conducting spherical particles of diameter @xmath1 occupy randomly a fraction of the sites of a regular lattice , and a continuum model , where the conducting particles are dispersed with an equilibrium distribution in a continuous insulating medium . by using both the effective medium approximation ( ema ) and monte carlo ( mc ) calculations , we find that the conductivity of the continuum model has a tunneling - like behavior independent of the value of @xmath0 , while the lattice model displays a percolation behavior of the conductivity only for sufficiently large @xmath0 values , which gradually crosses over to a tunneling - like regime as @xmath0 decreases .",

    "are further reduced and the transitions are much smoother , due of course to the fact that for these @xmath0 values the probability of tunneling to neighbors that are farther apart is enhanced . for @xmath94",
    "the variation of @xmath52 is so smooth in the whole range of @xmath4 that the underlying lattice structure can be considered as completely irrelevant .",
    "in contrast with the lattice case , the ema conductance @xmath52 resulting from an equilibrium distribution of conducting spheres in the continuum does not display any percolation behavior even for large @xmath0 values .",

    "it is interesting to notice that there is an overall quasi - quantitative agreement between the ema and the mc results , for both lattice and continuum models , meaning that the ema formulation of sec .",
    "[ ema ] captures well the physics of the problem . for example , the first percolation threshold at @xmath72 ( @xmath111 ) obtained from the ema on the cubic lattice is very close to the critical value @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) for the site percolation problem on the simple cubic lattice.@xcite an important expected difference is however found in the region @xmath114 where the mc conductivity for the lattice case should follow a @xmath89 dependence with a critical exponent @xmath115 instead of the ema exponent of @xmath90.@xcite this is indeed verified in fig .",

    "<S> here , we show that the conductivity of conductor - insulator composites in which electrons can tunnel from each conducting particle to all others may display both percolation and tunneling ( _ i.e. _ , hopping ) regimes depending on few characteristics of the composite . specifically , we find that the relevant parameters that give rise to one regime or the other are @xmath0 ( where @xmath1 is the size of the conducting particles and @xmath2 is the tunneling length ) and the specific composite microstructure . for large values of @xmath0 , percolation arises when the composite microstructure can be modeled as a regular lattice that is fractionally occupied by conducting particle , while the tunneling regime is always obtained for equilibrium distributions of conducting particles in a continuum insulating matrix . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath0 decreases the percolating behavior of the conductivity of lattice - like composites gradually crosses over to the tunneling - like regime characterizing particle dispersions in the continuum . for @xmath0 values </S>",
    "<S> lower than @xmath3 the conductivity has tunneling - like behavior independent of the specific microstructure of the composite . </S>"
