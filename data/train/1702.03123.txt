    "the one - way quantum deficit coincides with the relative entropy of coherence in the region where @xmath2 . while in the region where @xmath71 , the @xmath6 norm is greater than the relative entropy of coherence , which is greater than one - way quantum deficit .",

    "it can be seen that for a given @xmath31 @xmath76 , the quantum correlations decrease as the temperature increases . however , in a given region of @xmath31 @xmath77 , the quantum correlations indeed increase as the temperature increases when near the critical value of @xmath1 .",
    "the quantum phase transition phenomenon disappears as the temperature increases .    for the case of the transverse ising model ( @xmath34 ) at finite temperatures , as can be seen in the figures in the second row of fig.[fintet ] , the one - way quantum deficit increases when @xmath31 increases until it is nearly 1 .",
    "it then decreases as @xmath31 increases , even in the high temperature region .",
