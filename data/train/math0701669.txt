    "in this paper , we study some k3 surfaces of high rank . precisely , we consider k3 surfaces which have a shioda - inose structure : that is , an involution which preserves a global @xmath1-form , such that the quotient is a kummer surface .",
    "kummer surfaces are a special class of k3 surfaces which are quotients of abelian surfaces .",
    "the kummer surface thus carries algebro - geometric information about the abelian surface .",
    "it has nron - severi rank at least @xmath5 , and so therefore do the k3 surfaces with shioda - inose structure .",
    "these surfaces were first studied by shioda and inose @xcite , who give a description of _ singular _",
    "k3 surfaces , i.e. those with rank @xmath6 , the maximum possible for a k3 surface over a field of characteristic zero .",
    "they prove that there is a natural one - to - one correspondence between the set of singular k3 surfaces up to isomorphism and the set of equivalence classes of positive definite even integral binary quadratic forms .",
    "the result follows that of shioda and mitani @xcite who show that the set of singular abelian surfaces ( that is , those having picard number @xmath7 ) is also in one - to - one correspondence with the equivalence classes of positive definite even integral binary quadratic forms . the construction of shioda and inose produces a singular k3 surface by taking a double cover of a kummer surface associated to a singular abelian surface and with a specific type of elliptic fibration .",
    "the resulting k3 surface has an involution such that the quotient is the original kummer surface .",
    "it also turns out that the lattice of transcendental cycles on the k3 surface ( i.e.  the orthogonal complement of the nron - severi group in the second singular cohomology group ) is isomorphic to the lattice of transcendental cycles on the abelian surface .",
    "nikulin studied groups of automorphisms of k3 surfaces in @xcite , and morrison studied shioda - inose structures more extensively in @xcite , giving necessary and sufficient conditions for a k3 surface to have shioda - inose structure , in terms of the nron - severi group of the k3 surface .",
    "the shioda - inose setup takes a k3 surface and produces the data of a kummer surface , or of an abelian surface .",
    "one may reverse the question , and ask : given an abelian surface @xmath8 , can we produce a k3 surface with shioda - inose structure such that its quotient under the nikulin involution is birational to @xmath9 ?    in particular , when @xmath8 is the jacobian of a curve @xmath2 of genus @xmath1 , galluzzi and lombardo @xcite show that there is a unique k3 surface ( up to isomorphism ) with shioda - inose structure which corresponds to @xmath8 under this construction .",
    "dolgachev , in the appendix to the paper , proves an isomorphism between the moduli space of elliptic k3 surfaces with bad fibers of type @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and the moduli space of principally polarized abelian surfaces . however , the isomorphism is not explicit , and uses a result of naruki @xcite to show that the quotient surface constructed is a kummer surface .    in this paper",
    "we describe explicitly the relation between @xmath2 and the k3 surface @xmath0 with @xmath10 and @xmath11 fibers .",
    "it turns out that we can give an alternative elliptic fibration on @xmath0 , with a @xmath1-torsion section .",
    "the nikulin involution on @xmath0 is translation by the @xmath1-torsion section .",
    "the quotient elliptic surface under the @xmath1-isogeny is the kummer surface of a unique principally polarized abelian surface ( generically , the jacobian of a curve of genus @xmath1 ) .",
    "we relate the igusa - clebsch invariants of the genus @xmath1 curve to the moduli of the original k3 elliptic surface , thus giving an explicit description of the map on moduli spaces .",
    "this work generalizes a construction of elkies @xcite , who found a family of k3 elliptic surface with two @xmath10 fibers such that the quotient is birational to the kummer surface of a product of two elliptic curves @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and is related to it by a galois - invariant map of degree @xmath14 .",
    "earlier , inose @xcite had found the isogenous k3 surface to the kummer surface of @xmath15 , but with maps that were defined over an algebraically closed ground field .",
    "clingher and doran have also studied the k3 surfaces corresponding to @xmath15 in @xcite , as well as to @xmath16 more recently .",
    "such explicit formulas have some diophantine applications .",
    "elkies has used his techniques from @xcite to construct elliptic curves of high rank over @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "similarly , he used a k3 surface of rank @xmath19 corresponding to a rational point on a shimura curve to find an elliptic curve of rank at least @xmath20 over @xmath18 .",
    "as an application of the results of this paper , we can find explicit parameterizations of some hilbert modular surfaces .",
    "we hope to address these techniques and results in a future publication .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section @xmath1 , we recall facts about integral lattices which appear in this context as sublattices of nron - severi groups or cohomology groups of k3 surfaces . in section",
    "@xmath21 , we cover the necessary background on k3 surfaces , whereas section @xmath7 recalls the theory of genus @xmath1 curves . in section @xmath22 , we state and prove the main theorem , and in section @xmath23 , we describe a connection to the moduli space of @xmath23 points in @xmath3 .",

    "the @xmath1-torsion section is @xmath463 .",
    "the discriminant of this elliptic surface is a multiple of @xmath464 .",
    "in fact , we see that @xmath465 must have degree exactly @xmath23 , because there are six @xmath233 fibers that the zero and @xmath1-torsion sections meet in different components .",
    "the positions @xmath466 of the @xmath233 fibers are the roots of the polynomial @xmath467 .",

    "we can further fix @xmath186 up to scalings @xmath472 by translating @xmath186 so that the quadratic term of @xmath462 vanishes .",
    "we notice that the top coefficient @xmath282 of @xmath460 is a square , and so by scaling @xmath473 appropriately , we may assume @xmath474 , i.e. that @xmath460 and @xmath462 are monic .",

    "it is a weil function , so that the horizontal component of its divisor equals @xmath475 , and the vertical component is uniquely determined by that fact that @xmath476 is linearly ( and hence numerically ) equivalent to zero .",

    "now , notice that the @xmath339 fiber contains @xmath483 and @xmath426 .",

    "we write @xmath486 with a quadratic @xmath487 .",
    "next , we know that @xmath488 cuts out @xmath429 and @xmath489 cuts out @xmath490 . to find , for instance , the function which cuts out @xmath75 , we find the quadratic ( unique up to constants ) which passes through @xmath491 . call this function @xmath75 , by abuse of notation .",
    "similarly , we find @xmath492 .",
    "we also note that the factor of @xmath489 in the numerator of @xmath48 , which gives a zero along @xmath237 , also gives a zero along @xmath493 owing to the fact that @xmath494 intersects @xmath495 ( recall that we are working with the singular kummer surface , on which the image of the curve @xmath495 is just a single point ) .",
    "putting everything together , we can write @xmath48 up to scaling as a quotient of two homogeneous polynomials of degree @xmath137 as follows : @xmath496 finally , we have to scale @xmath48 and @xmath186 so that @xmath497 becomes a square of a function @xmath187 on the kummer .",
    "we note that in the equation of the kummer @xmath498 we can complete the square for @xmath499 to obtain @xmath500 we let @xmath187 be a constant multiple of @xmath501 a quotient of two homogenous polynomials of degree @xmath502 , and verify that this makes the weierstrass equation hold .",
    "the computation is carried out in a maxima program , which is available from the arxiv.org e - print archive .",

    "to access the auxiliary file download the source file for the paper .",
    "that will produce not only the latex files for the paper but also the computer algebra code .",
    "the code takes about half an hour to run on a @xmath503 ghz computer .",
    "we noted earlier that the permutation @xmath504 on the @xmath205 fibers by @xmath446 , and takes @xmath505 to @xmath506 .",
    "that is , it switches the components intersecting the identity and @xmath1-torsion sections as well .",
    "in addition , it switches the zero section @xmath507 and the @xmath1-torsion section @xmath508 , and on the @xmath339 fibers it switches the two near leaves @xmath428 and @xmath427 , namely , again the components intersecting @xmath237 and @xmath221 . on the other hand , consider the action on @xmath387 induced by the translation by @xmath237 . under this map , @xmath237 and",
    "@xmath221 get swapped , the @xmath1-torsion and identity components of the @xmath339 and @xmath205 fibers all get switched , and the far leaves of the @xmath339 fiber also get switched ( this can be seen , for instance , from the fact that the simple components of the special @xmath339 fiber form a group compatible with the group law on the generic elliptic curve ) .",
    "the locations of the @xmath205 fibers themselves are fixed .",
    "therefore the effect of the permutation @xmath509 is the same as translation by @xmath1-torsion composed with a pure involution @xmath510 of the @xmath205 fibers and a switch of the far leaves of the @xmath339 fiber .",
    "since the far leaves of the @xmath339 fiber are switched by the galois involution that multiplies the square root of @xmath511 by @xmath130 , this tells us that we have the correct quadratic twist , since @xmath512 is within a square factor of the discriminant of the sextic . that is ,",
    "making a different choice of @xmath1-level structure while describing the fibration on the kummer surface @xmath166 would have given us the same answer for @xmath0 !",
    "the construction above gave us a correspondence of sextics @xmath513 and @xmath514 therefore , over an algebraically closed field , we get a birational map from the moduli space of @xmath23 points in @xmath3 ( i.e. the quotient of @xmath515 under the action of @xmath458 and @xmath516 ) with the space of roots up to scaling of @xmath517 as @xmath518 vary ( we suppressed @xmath519 since it just scales @xmath520 and @xmath521 ) . this latter space is cut out inside @xmath522 by the hyperplane @xmath523 and the quartic hypersurface @xmath524 , where @xmath525 and @xmath526 are the second and fourth elementary symmetric functions of the @xmath527 .",
    "thus , we get a model as a singular quartic threefold in @xmath528 , which is known in the literature as the igusa quartic . here",
    "the igusa quartic arises naturally in the context of shioda - inose structures on k3 surfaces .",
    "there is no simple one - one correspondence between the roots of @xmath249 and @xmath529 , since the two actions of @xmath516 acting by the permutation representation on the six roots of @xmath249 on the six roots of @xmath529 are related by an outer automorphism . to see this",
    ", we recall from the last section that the permutation @xmath504 on the roots of @xmath249 ( the weierstrass points ) acts on the roots of @xmath529 ( which are the locations of the @xmath205 fibers ) by the permutation @xmath510 . by symmetry",
    ", all the transpositions of @xmath516 act by a product of three transpositions on the roots of @xmath529 .",
