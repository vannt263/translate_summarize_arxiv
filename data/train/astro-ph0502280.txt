    "the role of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars in contributing to the chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium ( ism ) has long been appreciated @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the dearth of self - consistent grids of non - parametric stellar models for low- and intermediate - mass stars ( lims ) ensured that that `` appreciation '' has remained more qualitative than quantitative .",
    "nowhere has this been more problematic than in attempts to understand the origin and evolution of the light- and intermediate - mass metals  atomic numbers between 6 and 15  where the discrepency between supernovae yields and observed stellar abundances is most acute @xcite .",
    "we have recently undertaken an ambitious program of coupled stellar and galactic chemical evolution modeling , preliminary results for which are described here .",
    "of order 50 stellar models were run using the mount stromlo stellar structure code ; a nucleosynthesis post - processing with time - dependent diffusive mixing was then applied , in order to derive detailed yield information @xcite .",
    "the parameter space covered was extensive , with masses ranging from 17 m@xmath1 , metallicities ranging from zero to super - solar ( for both scaled - solar and @xmath2-enhanced abundance ratios ) , as well as varying treatments of mass - loss and reaction rates .",
    "elements for which an initial mass function ( imf)-weighted abundance with respect to solar varied by more than 0.1  dex from that derived using the canonical lims yields of @xcite include atomic numbers 6@xmath0z@xmath015 ( carbon through phosphorus ) .",
    "these new stellar yields have now been implemented within   @xcite , a semi - analytical galaxy evolution code which treats the formation of the milky way within a dual - phase infall framework  the first , a rapid infall phase leading to the formation of the stellar halo ; the second , a more extended phase associated with the formation of the disk .",
    "such dual - phase formation scenarios have proven success in reproducing the metallicity distrubtion of nearby stars @xcite .",
    "includes a sophisticated treatment of chemical enrichment in the interstellar medium , with the yields of type  ia and ii supernovae ( sne ) , wolf - rayet stars , and agb stars , all incorporated .",
    "this powerful combination of  and the new yields has been demonstrated recently by @xcite .",
    "in the following subsections , we highlight just a few specific examples for which the new lims yields have led to interesting new insights into the distribution of elemental and isotopic abundances for atomic numbers 6@xmath0z@xmath015 .      over the past 4.5  gyr ,",
    "the ratio of -to-  ( by mass ) in the local ism has decreased @xmath320% .",
    "attempts at recovering this temporal behaviour in /  has led to the suggestion that significant pollution of the local ism by novae ejecta must have occurred over the lifetime of the milky way s disk @xcite .",
    "this conclusion was driven in part by the failure of standard lims yields @xcite to predict the observed decrease in the temporal evolution of /  over the disk s lifetime - see fig  1 of @xcite .",
    "conversely , after incorporating the new grid of lims yields into  our standard solar neighbourhood model predicts an @xmath315% _ decrease _ in /  over the past 4.5  gyr , in agreement with the aforementioned empirical data . over the lifetime of the disk ,",
    "the same ratio is predicted to have decreased by @xmath340% . in other words ,",
    "the new yields appear to obviate the need for a putative ( significant ) nova component to galactic chemical evolution .",
    "the nucleosynthesis pathways for fluorine production in agb stars involve both the helium and combined hydrogen - helium burning phases .",
    "the primary uncertainty in the net production rate can be traced to the adopted reaction rates of @xmath4c(@xmath2,@xmath5)@xmath6o and @xmath7f(@xmath2,@xmath8)@xmath9ne , and from the inclusion of partial mixing of protons from the envelope in the top layers of the helium intershell region @xcite .",
    "models of galactic chemical evolution which include _ only _ @xmath7f production from neutrino spallation of @xmath10ne in type  ii sne underproduce the observed [ f / o ] in the milky way and lmc by a factor of @xmath32 @xcite . after including the new lims yields within , supplemented with the @xmath7f yields for wolf - rayet stars at super - solar metallicity @xcite , we ran our standard milky way chemical evolution model .",
    "the new yields resulted - for the first time - in the successful recovery of the trend of [ f / o ] observed over @xmath31  dex in metallicity in the milky way and lmc @xcite .",
    "the neon isotope @xmath9ne is produced with relative ease in the helium - burning shell of agb stars via the capture of two @xmath2-particles onto residual @xmath4n remaining from the earlier operation of the cn - cycle ; subsequent thermal dredge - up mixes this @xmath9ne into the envelope .",
    "this @xmath9ne nucleosynthetic pathway appears to operate independent of metallicity , but only over a limited mass range ( @xmath11@xmath123.0@xmath130.5  m@xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9ne/@xmath10ne ratio for this @xmath9ne - enriched ejecta ( from stars with @xmath11@xmath123  m@xmath1 and @xmath14@xmath15@xmath16 ) is @xmath33 , comparable to the ratio expected in wolf - rayet stellar ejecta : @xmath9ne/@xmath10ne@xmath12310 for @xmath11@xmath1740  m@xmath1 and @xmath14@xmath17@xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the new yields , in combination with our standard galactic model , result in a factor of @xmath32 increase in @xmath9ne/@xmath10ne ( with no discernible impact on @xmath18ne/@xmath10ne ) over the past @xmath37  gyr history of the solar neighbourhood .",
    "in contrast , the isotopic ratio @xmath9ne/@xmath10ne in galactic cosmic rays has been measured to be anomalously high - @xmath35@xmath19 that of the solar wind .",
    "this observation has been attributed to the cosmic rays having been accelerated from superbubbles of metallicity @xmath33@xmath16 with the accompanying wolf - rayet ( and type  ii sne ) ejecta accounting for @xmath320% of the local ism",
    "( by mass ) @xcite",
    ". it would be useful to revisit this latter conclusion in light of this previously unappreciated source of @xmath9ne - agb stars of mass @xmath33  m@xmath1 .",
    "it is a well - known fact that galactic chemical evolution models which incorporate sodium yields from type  ii sne _ alone _",
    "tend to underproduce [ na / fe ] by a factor of @xmath323 over @xmath33 dex in metallicity @xcite .",
    "it has also been recognised for some time that the ne ",
    "na chain acting in agb stars can lead to the production of @xmath20na via proton capture on @xmath9ne @xcite .",
    "using our new yields , we have constructed the first milky way chemical evolution model which includes self - consistently the sodium production from both type  ii sne and agb stars .",
    "regardless of the type  ii sne yields adopted , the inclusion of sodium from agb stars results in fairly uniform 0.2 - 0.4  dex increase in the predicted [ na / fe ] in the ism for @xmath212@xmath15[fe / h]@xmath15@xmath220 , in excellent agreement with observations from @xcite.=40 - 100  m@xmath1 . for example , as the most massive model generated by @xcite is 40  m@xmath1 , if one decides to adopt an upper mass limit of , say , 100  m@xmath1 for the imf , one is forced to extrapolate the sodium production from the lower mass models . because this sodium production is a steeply increasing function of stellar mass , linearly extrapolating to 100  m@xmath1 can actually lead to a predicted [ na / fe ] vs [ fe / h ] behaviour which mimics ( again , coincidentally ) that encountered when using the new agb sodium yields .",
    "a careful consideration of very massive star sodium yields must be undertaken before we can make any further quantitative statements . ]      while the bulk of magnesium in the galaxy can be traced to type  ii sne , @xcite have shown that sub - solar metallicity agb stars can be important contributors of @xmath23 mg and @xmath24 mg isotopes to the ism .",
    "nucleosynthesis of these isotopes is believed to occur via @xmath2-capture on @xmath9ne triggered by helium shell thermal pulsing .",
    "more massive agb stars ( @xmath11=46  m@xmath1 ) may actually burn magnesium via hot bottom burning at the base of the convective envelope",
    ". models of galactic chemical evolution which include only the heavy magnesium isotopes returned to the ism via type  ii sne are significantly discrepant with observational data @xcite . incorporating the mg isotopic contribution from agb stars into",
    "leads to a factor of 23 increase in @xmath25mg/@xmath26 mg over @xmath32  dex in metallicity , in agreement with the distribution observed in the solar neighbourhood @xcite .",
    "our new stellar models produce @xmath27p efficiently ; when coupled with the phosphorus associated with type  ii sne @xcite , an @xmath30.2  dex enhancement in the predicted solar neighbourhood [ p / fe ] is seen across @xmath32  dex in metallicity ( @xmath212@xmath15[fe / h]@xmath15@xmath220 ) .",
    "while empirical stellar phosphorus abundances are difficult to determine , a firm upper limit of [ p / s]@xmath28@xmath220 has been placed on the intergalactic medium system . ]",
    "@xmath32  gyr after the big bang @xcite .",
    "such an empirical limit was already only 0.30.5  dex outside the predictions of chemical evolution models generated without an agb phosphorus component ( @xcite ; fig  6 ) ; the inclusion of our new @xmath27p agb yields into the same damped lyman-@xmath2 model means the current empirical limit is less than a factor of two outside the model predictions .",
    "future , more sensitive , observations of such high-@xmath29 clouds can therefore , in principle , support or refute this specific prediction of our new lims models .    9 a. renzini and m. voli , a&a 94 ( 1981 ) 175 .",
