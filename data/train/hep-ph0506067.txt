    "three events for the decay mode @xmath4 have been recently observed by the hypercp ( e871 ) collaboration  @xcite with results that suggest new physics may be needed to explain them . in this paper",
    "we re - examine this mode  @xcite within the standard model .",
    "there are short- and long - distance contributions to this decay . in the standard model  ( sm ) ,",
    "the leading short - distance contribution comes from the @xmath5-penguin and box diagrams , as well as the electromagnetic penguin with the photon connected to the dimuon pair  @xcite .",
    "we find that this contribution yields a branching ratio of order  @xmath6 , which is much smaller than the central experimental value of @xmath7 reported by hypercp  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the long - distance contribution to the weak radiative mode @xmath8 is much larger than the short - distance contribution .",
    "it is therefore also possible to have enhanced long - distance contributions to @xmath9 via an intermediate virtual photon from @xmath8 .",
    "we find that the resulting branching ratio is in agreement with the measured value .",
    "there is , of course , still the possibility  @xcite that new physics is responsible for the observed branching ratio of @xmath8 and hence that of @xmath9 .",
    "this implies that it is essential to have an up - to - date estimate of the standard - model contributions , on which we concentrate in this work .    in sec .",
    "[ sd ] we update the estimate of the short - distance amplitude .",
    "we use the standard effective hamiltonian for the @xmath10 transition  @xcite supplemented with hadronic matrix elements for the relevant currents . in sec .",
    "[ ld ] we study the long - distance contributions mediated by a real or a virtual photon",
    ". these can be parameterized by four ( complex ) gauge - invariant form - factors  @xcite .",
    "we determine the imaginary parts of these form factors from unitarity .",
    "the real parts of two of the form factors can be reasonably assumed to be constant as a first approximation and can then be extracted from the measured rate and asymmetry parameter for @xmath11 up to a fourfold ambiguity .",
    "the real parts of the two remaining form - factors can not be extracted from experiment at present , and so we estimate them using vector - meson - dominance models . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sum ] we combine all these results to present the predictions for the rates and spectra of the two modes @xmath12 . before concluding , we discuss the implications of our analysis for the possibility that new physics could be present in the recent measurement by hypercp .",

    "the resulting branching ratio for @xmath39 is about @xmath6 , which is way below the observed value .",
    "there are uncertainties in the hadronic matrix elements , the wilson coefficients , and the ckm - matrix elements , but these uncertainties will not change this result by orders of magnitude . we therefore conclude that in the sm the short - distance contribution is too small to explain the hypercp data on @xmath39 .",
    "now , a large branching ratio for @xmath13 may be related to the large observed branching ratio for @xmath8 , compared with their respective short - distance contributions . with only the short - distance contribution to @xmath40 within the sm ,",
    "the branching ratio is predicted to be much smaller than the experimental value  @xcite .",
    "however , beyond the sm it is possible to have an enhanced short - distance contribution to @xmath40  @xcite which would enhance the amplitude for @xmath39 .",
    "the origin of the enhancement may be from new interactions such as @xmath41-@xmath42 mixing in left - right symmetric models and left - right squark mixing in supersymmetric models  @xcite .",
    "these types of interactions have small effects on other related flavor - changing processes such as @xmath43-@xmath44 mixing , but can have large effects on @xmath8 and therefore also on @xmath23 .",
    "thus the observed branching ratio for @xmath8 can be reproduced even if one assumes that there is only the short - distance contribution .",
    "more likely , however , the enhancement is due to long - distance contributions within the sm . in the next section we present the most complete estimate possible at present for these long - distance contributions .",
    "in this section we deal with the contributions to @xmath45 that are mediated by a  photon . for a real intermediate photon there are two form factors that can be extracted from the weak radiative hyperon decay @xmath46 and are usually parameterized by the effective lagrangian @xmath47 the two form factors , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , are related to the width and decay distribution of the radiative decay by @xmath50 @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the photon energy , and @xmath53 is the angle between the spin of @xmath54 and the three - momentum of @xmath55 .",
