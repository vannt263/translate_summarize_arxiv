    "the invariance of the intrinsic hamiltonian with respect to the signature symmetry gives rise to the occurrence of two rotational bands in odd and odd - odd nuclei that differ in spin by @xmath3 .",
    "these bands are built upon the same intrinsic configuration but differ in their signature symmetry eigenvalue , @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "often the signature exponent @xmath5 [ @xmath6  mod  2 ] is used to label these bands where @xmath5 is related to @xmath4 via @xmath7 .    in general ,",
    "signature partner bands are not equivalent energetically .",
    "the energy difference is called signature splitting when measured in the rotating frame of reference as a function of frequency .",
    "the origin of the splitting is essentially due to the mixing of the @xmath8 state into wave function .",
    "since this component has a non - zero diagonal matrix element of the cranking operator @xmath9 of opposite sign for each signature , one expects one signature to gain ( or lose ) energy with increasing frequency with respect to the other . for high-@xmath10 one - quasiparticle ( 1-qp ) unique - parity configurations ,",
    "the favored signature is obtained by the simple rule , @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "however , in unique parity 2-qp configuration in odd - odd nuclei , it may occur that @xmath12 band may become energetically unfavored .",
    "similar effects have been observed in some odd - a nuclei in 3-qp configuration  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is called signature inversion  @xcite .",
    "signature inversion has been observed , for example , in odd - odd nuclei for the @xmath0 configurations in the a@xmath13130 and @xmath1 configurations in a@xmath13160 regions .",
    "different theoretical attempts have been presented to interpret the phenomenon .",
    "triaxiality of the nuclear shape was suggested in refs .",
    "the general condition for signature inversion to take place  @xcite was positive triaxial deformation , @xmath14 , within the lund convention combined with a specific position of the fermi surface , see also  @xcite .",
    "one should point out , however , that * ( i ) * the @xmath15-values are almost impossible to measure directly in experiment ; * ( ii ) * the values of the @xmath15 parameter necessary to account for the experimental data are not always supported by potential energy calculations which in many cases predicts almost axial shapes @xcite .",
    "triaxiality seems , therefore , to be not always sufficient calling for alternative or supplementary mechanism .",
    "hamamoto  @xcite and matsuzaki  @xcite analyzed the long - range , residual proton - neutron ( @xmath16 ) @xmath17 interaction .",
    "they concluded that the self - consistent value of the strength parameter @xmath18 is far too weak to account for the empirical data .",
    "semmes and ragnarsson  @xcite considered a residual @xmath16 contact force with spin - spin interaction , @xmath19 , in the framework of the particle - rotor model .",
    "remarkably , using one set of parameters",
    "@xmath20 , @xmath21 , it appeared possible to reproduce very accurately some @xmath0 bands in the a@xmath13130 region and @xmath1 bands in rare - earth nuclei , without invoking triaxiality  @xcite .",
    "however , to account for the @xmath22 bands in rare - earth nuclei , a substantial reduction of the strength parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 was necessary  @xcite .",
    "signature inversion is also obtained in the projected shell - model at axial symmetric shapes , resulting from the crossing of different bands with opposite signature dependence@xcite .",
    "another probe of the mechanism behind signature inversion are the electromagnetic transition amplitudes .",
    "the ratios of the bm1/be2 transition rates are very sensitive to the deformation parameters ( @xmath15 and @xmath23 ) and whether the decay goes from favored states to unfavored or vice versa@xcite . in the present paper , however , we restrict ourselves entirely to the systematics of routhians and spins . calculations of bm1/be2 ratios are beyond the scope of this work .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we have published the results of deformation and pairing self - consistent total routhian surface ( trs ) calculations for @xmath24cs .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the inclusion of quadrupole pairing correlations ( @xmath25-pairing ) , number projection and a proper treatment of blocking into the trs model made it possible to reproduce signature inversion without invoking the @xmath16 interaction . in this paper , we demonstrate that our extended trs model is able to reproduce rather accurately and systematically the signature inversion in odd - odd @xmath26cs , @xmath27la , @xmath28 tb , @xmath29ho and @xmath30tm nuclei and that the mechanism causing signature inversion is triaxiality combined with the contribution of the @xmath31 component of the @xmath25-pairing force to the single - particle potential .    in the next section , we present a brief outline of our model .",
    "a general discussion on the role of the @xmath25-pairing force with respect to signature inversion is given in sec .",
    "the discussion of empirical spin assignments and the results of self - consistent trs calculations are presented in sec .",
    "iv for the odd - odd @xmath26cs , @xmath27la , @xmath28 tb , @xmath29ho and @xmath30tm nuclei .",
    "a summary is given in the last section .",
    "the trs method@xcite is a macroscopic - microscopic approach in a uniformly - rotating body - fixed frame of reference  @xcite .",
    "the total routhian of a nucleus is calculated on a grid in deformation space , using the strutinsky shell correction method  @xcite .",
    "the model employs the deformed woods - saxon potential of ref .",
    "@xcite and liquid - drop model of ref .",
    "the pairing energy is calculated using a separable interaction of seniority and doubly - stretched quadrupole type : @xmath32 where @xmath33 the above expression employs good signature basis  @xcite , @xmath34 stands for the time - reversed state and @xmath35 . to avoid the sudden collapse of pairing correlations",
    ", we use the lipkin - nogami approximate number projection  @xcite .",
    "it is important to stress that the model is _ free _ of adjustable strength parameters .",
    "the monopole pairing strength , @xmath36 , is determined by the average gap method of ref .",
    "@xcite and the @xmath25-pairing strengths , @xmath37 , are calculated to restore the galilean invariance broken by the seniority pairing force , see the prescription in ref .",
    "for example , in the a@xmath13130 mass region , where the 56(66 ) lowest proton ( neutron ) single - particle levels are used for the pairing calculation , the pairing strengths parameters are equal @xmath38kev and @xmath39kev/@xmath40 for protons ( neutrons ) . in the a@xmath13160 mass region ,",
    "single - particle levels between 10 - 70(15 - 90 ) were used for the pairing calculations for protons ( neutrons ) and typical values of the strength parameters are @xmath41kev and @xmath42kev/@xmath40 for protons ( neutrons ) .",
    "let us recall that the use of the double - stretched generators for the @xmath25-pairing force result in , to a large extent , isotropic and shape independent values of @xmath37  @xcite .",
    "the resulting cranked - lipkin - nogami ( cln ) equation takes the form of the well known hartree - fock - bogolyubov - like ( hfb ) equation . in the trs model , the cln equation",
    "is solved self - consistently at each frequency and each grid point in deformation space which includes quadrupole @xmath43 and hexadecapole @xmath44 shapes ( pairing self - consistency ) .",
    "finally , the equilibrium deformations are calculated by minimizing the total routhian with respect to the shape parameters ( shape self - consistency ) . for further details concerning the formalism , we refer the reader to ref .  @xcite .",
    "in our previous works  @xcite , it has been shown that @xmath25-pairing , in particular its time - odd @xmath45 component , plays an important role in the alignment of quasi - particles .",
    "it strongly influences the moment of inertia and partly can account for twinning of the spectra of odd and even super - deformed nuclei in the a@xmath13190 mass region .",
    "the two - body pairing interaction enters also the single - particle channel via the @xmath46 potential : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the density matrix .",
    "the single - particle contribution coming from the separable pairing force is usually small and in many applications simply disregarded .",
    "however , in the lipkin - nogami approach , it has to be taken into account for the consistency of the method .",
    "interestingly , in spite of its weakness , the @xmath49 field plays a rather important role for the signature inversion as will be demonstrated in the following .",
    "let us consider an odd - odd nucleus with an unpaired proton and neutron occupying the high-@xmath10 , unique - parity orbits .",
    "the favored signature is expected to be @xmath50 . however , when one of the particles is low in the shell and the other occupies orbits around the middle or above the middle of the shell , signature inversion can occur . in the a@xmath13130 region",
    "e.g. , two signatures , @xmath51 , of the @xmath0 configuration are seen in experiment . for the protons ,",
    "only the signature - favored @xmath52 orbit is observed since the signature splitting of @xmath53 low-@xmath54 levels is typically several hundred kev .",
    "for instance , in @xmath24cs , it is calculated to be more than 0.7mev at @xmath55mev .",
    "the role of this low-@xmath54 , high-@xmath10 orbit is to induce a deformation close to axial symmetry with slight tendency towards positive @xmath15 value  @xcite .",
    "otherwise it acts as spectator and the signature splitting is entirely due to the neutrons .",
    "1 shows the influence of each @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) component of the @xmath25-pairing interaction on the signature splitting @xmath58 , between the unfavored @xmath59 and favored @xmath60 routhians as a function of the quadrupole pairing strength @xmath37 relative to the value @xmath61 determined according to ref .",
    "the calculations were performed for @xmath24cs at fixed frequency and axial shape in order to address the effects of the @xmath25-pairing force alone . to find the origin of the signature inversion , we performed calculations with and without the mean - field contributions @xmath62 .",
    "the figure nicely demonstrates the role of the @xmath49 potential : it is the only component of ( @xmath63 ) that creates signature inversion of the order of a few tens of kev already at axial shape .    to gain a better understanding of the role played by the mean - field potential @xmath62 as a function of neutron number , fig .",
    "2 shows the contribution to the signature splitting steming from the @xmath46-potential @xmath64 , where : @xmath65 as a function of @xmath66 in the a@xmath13130 mass region ( superscript @xmath67 refers to the signature of the blocked @xmath68 quasi - particles ) .",
    "neutron number n=59 corresponds to the occupation of the @xmath8 orbit , while at n=75 the @xmath69 orbit of the @xmath68 subshell becomes occupied .",
    "note again , that axial , fixed deformation was chosen to address the role of the @xmath25-pairing force effects alone .",
    "obviously , the contribution @xmath70 varies with the position of the fermi energy .",
    "there is a clear tendency for all components of the pairing force to favor the unfavored signature . at the bottom of the @xmath71 subshell ( corresponding to 59@xmath72n@xmath7261 ) the @xmath73 , @xmath74 and even @xmath75 show trends ( negative contributions ) towards the anomalous signature splitting . in these cases",
    ", however , the signature splitting caused by the coriolis force is considerably larger , implying that signature inversion can not occur . around the middle of the shell ( corresponding to 63@xmath72n@xmath7269 ) where the signature splitting induced by the coriolis force is rather small or even absent at low rotational frequencies",
    ", the @xmath49 potential favors the inversion and may even compete with the coriolis force .",
    "note , that this corresponds to the neutron numbers where indeed the signature inversion has been observed experimentally , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "the signature splitting , @xmath76 , as a function of the neutron shell filling with and without @xmath25-pairing is shown in fig .  3 .",
    "the calculations were done at fixed _ triaxial _ shape of @xmath77 and at @xmath78mev .",
    "both sets of the calculations result in signature inversion for neutron numbers @xmath79 .",
    "however , a clear increase in the anomalous splitting of the order @xmath1340kev is caused by the @xmath25-pairing force .",
    "the size of the signature inversion as a function of the triaxiality parameter @xmath15 for the case of @xmath24cs can be studied in fig .",
    "note , that the contribution due to the @xmath25-pairing is almost independent of @xmath15 due to double stretching  @xcite . in a previous work  @xcite on @xmath24cs ,",
    "the @xmath15 deformation obtained from the earlier trs calculations ( including only seniority pairing treated non - self - consistently and no number projection ) could not account for the observed signature splitting . in the extended trs calculations ,",
    "the combined effects of triaxiality and @xmath25-pairing force reproduce the data in this nucleus very well  @xcite .    for the a@xmath13130 and a@xmath13160 nuclei",
    ", the anomalous signature splitting happens at low rotational frequencies where the coriolis mixing is weak .",
    "however , with increasing rotational frequency , the coriolis force dominates always and restores signature splitting to normal order .",
    "the critical frequency , @xmath80 , at which this takes place is another characteristic quantity of signature inversion .",
    "5 shows a significant increase in @xmath80 due to the presence of @xmath25-pairing . finally , fig .",
    "6 shows the effect of the @xmath25-pairing force on the total angular momentum @xmath81 as a function of the shell filling .",
    "the calculations were performed at @xmath55mev . in general , @xmath25-pairing slightly increases ( decreases ) @xmath81 for the unfavored ( favored ) signature , respectively .",
    "moreover , the effect is somewhat larger for the unfavored signature branch .",
    "although globally the effect is rather modest , it clearly reduces the normal signature splitting or enhances anomalous signature splitting , depending on neutron number .",
    "let us make the following few remarks summarizing the discussion of this section .",
    "it seems rather well documented that signature inversion ( in axially deformed nuclei ) in our calculation is due to the @xmath49 potential .",
    "the effect is not accidently related to the particular choice of pairing strength parameters . indeed , a change of @xmath36 and(or ) @xmath37 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) by@xmath8210% only weakly affects the calculated value of @xmath76 .",
    "our calculations also do not show that the effect is related to number - projection .",
    "analogous calculations but performed within the bcs approximation led us to similar conclusions",
    ". however , it is of crucial importance to perform rigorous blocking for each signature separately . indeed , approximating",
    "the odd - n system by a one quasiparticle state created on top of the odd - n vacuum does not result in any inversion .",
    "blocking of signature partners at non - zero rotational frequency ( where signature splitting due to time - reversal symmetry breaking sets in ) leads to , in general small , differences in density matrices @xmath83 and @xmath84 which in turn result in differences between @xmath85 and @xmath86 potentials for favored and unfavored signature bands , respectively .",
    "however , we were not able to recognize a simple mechanism causing the small differences in the density matrices to add up `` coherently '' and eventually form such a regular pattern as depicted in figs .  1 - 6 .",
    "in this section , we present the results from the pairing and deformation self - consistent trs model described in sec .",
    "ii for the odd - odd @xmath26cs , @xmath27la , @xmath28 tb , @xmath29ho and @xmath30tm nuclei .",
    "in order to compare theory and experiment , the correct spin assignments of the bands are crucial .",
    "indeed , by changing the spin values by one unit , the signature splitting becomes inverted and a totally different pattern emerges . particularly in odd - odd nuclei , due to the complexity of the low - spin spectra",
    ", spins are not always directly determined in experiment .",
    "this is the case for many of the rotational bands associated with the @xmath0 configuration in the @xmath87 region and @xmath1 configurations in the @xmath88 region .",
    "therefore , we start our discussion by revisiting current spin assignments in these bands .",
    "as mentioned above , the spin assignments of many rotational bands associated with the @xmath0 configuration in the @xmath87 region and with the @xmath1 in the @xmath88 region are tentative and based mainly on systematics . however , if the underlying assumptions or `` the first guesses '' are false , incorrect assignment may spread over many nuclei .",
    "indeed , the spin assignments in these nuclei are very controversial . in @xmath89la",
    ", for example , the recent experiment  @xcite firmly established the experimental spins via in - beam and @xmath23-decay measurements .",
    "the previous spin assignment of ref .",
    "@xcite was lower by @xmath90 !",
    "our calculation is in good agreement with the experimental data in @xmath89la based on the recent spin assignment  @xcite , see fig .",
    "also for @xmath24cs  @xcite , very good agreement between calculations and experiment is achieved , see fig .  8 and  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we choose these two nuclei as the reference nuclei to verify spin assignments in the @xmath0 bands in the cs and la isotopes .",
    "we further assume in our analysis that nuclear moments of inertia @xmath91 smoothly decrease with increasing neutron number .",
    "this assumption is supported by comparison with neighboring even - even nuclei and by deformation systematics@xcite , see also fig .",
    "10 . based on the systematic analysis and at the same time compared with our cranking calculations , new spin values are suggested as shown in table  i.    the experimental  moments of inertia for the cs and la isotopes corresponding to our new assignments are shown in fig .",
    "7 . they decrease smoothly with increasing fermi energy .",
    "the sensitivity of the method is shown for the case of @xmath92la . as is seen in fig .  7 , changing the spins by @xmath93 introduces rather sharp kinks in the sequence of the moments of inertia in these nuclei , imposing rather strong restrictions for the relative spin values between the different isotopes",
    ". this analysis can of course not replace any experimental verification , but at present corresponds to the most reliable way in the absence of accurate data .",
    "we have also investigated the spin assignments for the @xmath1 bands of @xmath94 tb , @xmath29ho and @xmath30tm . for this mass region ,",
    "our calculations agree well with the bulk part of the data as well as the recent analysis@xcite .",
    "systematics of the empirical moments of inertia (  is expected to increase with neutron number in this mass region ) and spins suggest that the experimental assignments of @xmath95ho and @xmath96 tb are too low .",
    "such assignments can in general not account for the initial alignment that one expects from low-@xmath54 , high-@xmath10 orbits . with the guidance of the available spin assignments and our cranking calculations",
    ", we suggest the spin values presented in table i. the comparison between experimental ( with our spin assignments ) and theoretical values of @xmath81 versus @xmath97 are shown in figs .  8 and 9 for the a@xmath13130 and a@xmath13160 mass regions , respectively .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , the spin assignments for the a@xmath13130 and a@xmath13160 nuclei were investigated by energy systematics .",
    "our assignments are in general consistent with their results .",
    "however , liu _",
    "give three different sets of assignments for the cs isotopes depending on the choice of the reference nucleus@xcite .",
    "one of the sets coincides with our result .",
    "systematical changes in the assigned spin values ( e.g. by 2@xmath98 ) do not change the ( energy ) systematics @xcite . we have chosen @xmath89la@xcite and the lighter isotope of @xmath24cs  @xcite guided by theoretical results , see fig .",
    "this assignment is also consistent with the measurements for @xmath99cs@xcite .",
    "the nice agreement between the calculation and experiment ( in particular for @xmath89la ) gives some confidence for the present method , see fig .",
    "especially the low spin - part agrees rather well with the experimental data .",
    "the increase in angular momentum with frequency for the favored signature is in general too strong when compared to experiment .",
    "10 depicts the equilibrium deformation parameters @xmath100 and @xmath15 obtained from the trs calculations . for the @xmath87 nuclei , in general , the @xmath100 and @xmath15 deformations decrease with increasing neutron number .",
    "however , the nuclear shapes of some @xmath87 nuclei are usually rather soft , which may lead to some inaccuracy in determining the equilibrium deformations as well as it may affect other observables , in particular @xmath81 values .",
    "the calculated deformations of the two signatures are rather close , but one should be aware that this may not always be the case , see e.g @xmath101cs ( fig .  10 )",
    ".    for the @xmath88 isotopes , the the @xmath100 ( @xmath15 ) deformation value is increasing ( decreasing ) with neutron number , @xmath66 .",
    "this is consistent with the increase of the moments of inertia with @xmath66 .",
    "the @xmath15 deformations of the @xmath88 nuclei are rather small . with increasing @xmath66 ,",
    "the @xmath15 deformations are predicted to change from small positive to small negative values . for most cases ,",
    "the calculations yield a decrease of the deformation with increasing rotational frequency .    the quality of the present calculations is nicely demonstrated in fig .",
    "11 and fig .",
    "12 , where we compare experimental and calculated routhians , @xmath102 . especially for the cs- and la - siotopes , the agreement is in general within 50  kev . for the case of the heavier rare earth nuclei , at relatively high frequency @xmath103mev , the calculated routhians do not agree well with the experimental data .",
    "the deviations between experiment and theory can be linked to the fact that the unblocked neutron @xmath104 crossings occur too early in the calculations for some cases .",
    "we also compare the difference of the routhians @xmath105 obtained in the trs - calculations and experiment , fig .",
    "13 and fig .  14 . is opposite to the one chosen in previous figures ] in order to calculate the experimental values of @xmath106 we performed a linear interpolation of the unfavoured routhians @xmath107 at the frequency values of the favoured signature .",
    "again , the agreement for the a=120 - 130 region is quite good . on the other hand , for the rare earth nuclei ,",
    "the inversion is calculated to continue to somewhat higher frequencies and also to be more pronounced than in experiment . however , given the rather modest values of the inversion , in general @xmath108  kev , one can be quite content with the results . above the frequency of @xmath109",
    "mev ( not seen in fig .  14 ) , the inversion has disappeared for all cases considered here . the trs - calculations clearly show that the mean - field model can account for the signature inversion phenomenon , once shape - polarization and pairing effects are treated self - consistently .",
    "the anomalous signature splitting is obtained already at almost axial shapes , due to the contribution of the @xmath2 @xmath25-pairing interaction to the single - particle potential .",
    "the overall agreement between theory and experiment appears satisfactory .",
    "we have demonstrated that shape and pairing self - consistent mean - field calculations can account for the rotational band structure of the unique parity high-@xmath10 orbits in the odd - odd a@xmath13130 and a@xmath13160 nuclei . in particular , the signature inversion phenomenon is reproduced .",
    "the agreement between theory and the data is satisfactory provided that some of the empirical spin assignments are revised .",
    "new spins are suggested based on a systematic analysis of the  moments of inertia which rather firmly establishes relative spins along each isotopic chain considered here .",
    "the absolute spin values are finally determined partly guided ( see sec .",
    "iv ) by theoretical values .",
    "the experimental signature - splittings are quite well reproduced although the trs calculations yield rather modest values of the triaxiality parameter @xmath15 ( @xmath110 ) for most cases .",
    "this can be understood in terms of the additional enhancement of the anomalous signature splitting caused by the mean - field contribution of the @xmath2 component of the quadrupole pairing interaction , see sec .",
    "some deficiencies of the model are clearly visible particularly at high rotational frequency and for @xmath15-soft nuclei .",
    "other effects , such as the coupling between rotation and @xmath15-vibration , may need to be taken into account .",
    "also more elaborate forces , in particular accounting for the valence neutron - proton interaction @xcite , might further improve the agreement to the data . for a full understanding of this intriguing phenomenon , the calculations of electromagnetic transitions rates are important .",
