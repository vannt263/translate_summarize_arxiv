    "in contrast to idealized theoretical models @xcite of topological superconductivity where only dirac surface states cross the fermi level , real samples exhibit a complex phenomenology due to the coexistence of multiple bands at the chemical potential , as demonstrated in our data above .",
    "thus , the interpretation of experimental studies must take into account both the desirable cooper pairing from the dirac surface states and conventional superconductivity from the bulk , trivial surface states and impurity surface states .",
    "the coexistence of multiple bands at the fermi level means that any superconductivity realized in actual ti materials consist of not only the desirable helical cooper pairing from the dirac surface states but also conventional superconductivity from the bulk states , as shown above in our data .",
    "we note that although progress has been reported by using conventional transport and stm experiments @xcite , those studies do not have the spin and momentum resolution necessary to distinguish the helical cooper pairing from that of the conventional superconductivity from other bands that intermix at the interface making interpretation of majorana fermions unreliable or complex .",
    "hence a direct experimental demonstration of the existence of superconductivity in the helical cooper pairing channel remained elusive before our momentum and spin space observations reported here .",
    "in fact , it has been recently shown both theoretically and experimentally @xcite that the conventional superconductivity in the bulk and impurity bands at the interface or surface lead to ambiguous interpretations of the transport and stm data . in order to achieve a clear case for majorana zero mode ,",
    "the helical component of the cooper pairing must be isolated , as demonstrated here .",
    "therefore , it is in this context that our observation of helical cooper pairing and superconductivity in a half dirac gas is of critical importance . additionally , the overall methodology employed here can be applied to isolate helical cooper pairing in other systems and in connection to a feedback loop for material growth for the optimization of the helical channel .",
    "we also note that our systematic studies ( by observing the superconducting gap ( leading edge shift ) , the clear coherence peak , as well as their systematic dependence upon varying temperature , ti film thickness and doping magnetic impurities ) are in contrast to the debatable arpes results on bi@xmath5se@xmath6/bscco samples @xcite . in that case , no superconducting coherence peak was observed @xcite , and the claim of a @xmath39 mev leading edge shift @xcite in the dirac surface states in bi@xmath5se@xmath6/bscco is in contrast to the absence of any observable leading edge shift in the other two studies @xcite .",
    "in fact , a strong superconducting proximity effect is inconsistent with important facts including the severe mismatch of both fermi momenta and crystal symmetries between bi@xmath5se@xmath6 and bscco , very short out - of - plane superconducting coherence length of high-@xmath27 superconductors , as well as the different superconducting pairing symmetries between a ti and a @xmath40wave cuprate superconductor .",
    "thus , our data strongly supports the view that ti / nbse@xmath5 is a more ideal platform than ti / bscco for the proposed novel physics if the system can be further optimized increasing helical cooper pairing channel by tuning the material parameters .",
    "we discuss the emergent topological phenomena that can be enabled by our identification of helical - cooper pairing .",
    "one exciting scenario is to realize supersymmetric phenomenon in our experimental setup @xcite by further improvement of the film quality and magnetic doping process . as shown in fig . 6**d * * , magnetic doping or an external in - plane magnetic field is necessary to drive the system to the critical point between the helical superconductivity and the normal dirac gas states , with the chemical potential tuned to the dirac point ( demonstrated in fig . 6**b * * ) . under this condition",
    ", theory predicts that topological surface states ( a fermionic excitation ) and the fluctuations of superconducting order ( a bosonic excitation ) satisfy supersymmetry relationship , and therefore , strikingly , possess the same fermi / dirac velocity and same lifetime or self - energy @xcite . while the superpartners of elementary particles in high energy physics have never been experimentally observed , the experimental methodologies , artificial sample fabrication control and experimental observations reported here pave the way for simulating and testing supersymmetric physics concepts in future sub - kelvin nanodevices fabricated out of sample configurations discussed here .",

    "<S> six representative momenta , namely @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are chosen for detailed studies , where @xmath13 @xmath14 corresponds to the tsss , and @xmath15 @xmath14 and @xmath16 @xmath14 correspond to the outer and inner parts of the bulk band states , respectively . in order to search for possible superconductivity signals , we study the arpes energy - spectra at various momentum space locations in close vicinity to the fermi level ( @xmath17 mev ) . fig . 2**c </S>",

    "<S> clear leading - edge shifts ( superconducting gap ) and coherence peaks are observed at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the observed superconducting signals as temperature increases disappear at higher temperatures such as @xmath19 k and 12 k. in order to better visualize the superconductivity gap in our data , the arpes spectra are symmetrized with respect to the fermi level , where the temperature evolution of the full ( symmetrized ) superconducting gap and the coherence peaks are clearly seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2**d**. these measurements show the existence of induced superconductivity in the helical dirac electrons occurring in the bi@xmath5se@xmath6 tsss , which is not possible in conventional momentum - integrated experiments that lacking spin resolution @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we compare and contrast the proximity induced superconductivity in the dirac surface states to that of the bulk band states . </S>",
    "<S> fig . 2**e * * shows the arpes spectra at @xmath20 , where the bulk conduction bands are identified . </S>",
    "<S> superconducting signals including leading edge shifts and coherence peaks are also observed at @xmath20 . in order to obtain the magnitude of the superconducting energy gap </S>",
    "<S> , we fit the bulk state ( @xmath11 , and @xmath12 ) data by the dynes function @xcite ( black curves in fig . 2**g * * ) , which is widely used in @xmath1-wave superconductors , whereas the surface state data ( @xmath10 ) is fitted by a bcs function with consideration of the spin - momentum locking and dirac dispersion properties of the tsss ( blue curves in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2**g * * ) .    since the surface states and the bulk conduction bands co - exist at the chemical potential ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2**b * * ) , we need to examine whether the observed superconducting proximity signal at @xmath18 has contribution from the bulk bands . to further isolate the signals of dirac surface states from the bulk bands , we choose another incident photon energy of 50 ev where we utilize the photoemission matrix element effect to suppress the spectral weight of the bulk conduction states . as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2**i * * , at photon energy of 50 ev , the bulk conduction band is almost completely suppressed and the only dispersive band near the fermi level is the dirac surface state . </S>",
    "<S> we subsequently study the spectra at the momentum @xmath18 where the arpes signal is dominated by the contribution from the surface states . </S>",
    "<S> leading edge shifts and coherence peaks are clearly observed from @xmath18 , which confirms the superconductivity in the dirac surface states using a different photon energy . </S>",
    "<S> these systematic momentum - resolved measurements clearly show the existence of a superconducting helical electron gas , which is realized on the top surface of bi@xmath5se@xmath6 grown on top of an @xmath1-wave superconductor nbse@xmath5 .    </S>",
    "<S> we perform arpes measurements around the surface state fermi surface as a function of fermi surface azimuthal angle @xmath21 , to study the extent of anisotropy of the surface state superconducting gap . to isolate the surface state signal from the bulk </S>",
    "<S> , photon energy of 50 ev is used , where only surface states are observed near the fermi level as seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3**a**. five representative momentum space cut - directions ( @xmath22 ) are chosen as indicated by the dotted lines in fig . 3**a**. </S>",
    "<S> the helical - surface state superconducting gap observed by arpes at different @xmath21 angles and their fits are shown in fig . 3**b**. </S>",
    "<S> the reasonably good surface state fitting results ( blue curves in figs . 2**g * * and 3**b * * ) indicate that the obtained surface state superconductivity is consistent with its spin - helical and linear dispersive properties , which supports its helical - cooper pairing nature . the obtained magnitude of superconducting order parameter is then plotted as a function of fermi surface angle in fig . 3**c**. </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting gap is found to be nearly isotropic , which is also consistent with the time - reversal invariant helical nature of the surface state superconductivity as expected theoretically @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the helical cooper pairing in the topological surface states as observed here is also different from that of in other singly degenerate ( spin - momentum locked ) but non - topological systems . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in a rashba-2deg , although the electrons are also singly degenerate , but along any @xmath23direction , there are still both spin up and spin down electrons available for cooper pairing ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3**e * * ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , only in the topological surface state , there are electrons with only one spin available for the cooper pairing along any @xmath23direction ( fig . 3**d * * ) . </S>",
    "<S> this unique property as demonstrated here ( which we refer as the helical cooper pairing ) is indispensable for all the fascinating phenomena as predicted in theories @xcite . in fig . 3**f * * , we present model calculation analysis , which shows a @xmath24 superconducting order parameter in the dirac surface states , supporting the helical cooper pairing nature . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , through our systematic arpes measurements with simultaneous energy , momentum and spin resolution , we observe superconductivity in an odd number of spin - momentum locked dirac surface states , which serves as the direct experimental evidence for the helical - cooper pairing .    </S>",
    "<S> * dependence on surface - surface hybridization *    we study the observed superconductivity in the surface states as a function of surface - to - surface hybridization strength ( effectively as a function of the ti film thickness ) , in order to experimentally prove its proximity - induced nature . as shown in fig . 4**a * * , a sample with a dirac point hybridization gap as large as @xmath25 mev is realized in a 3ql film sample . </S>",
    "<S> clear leading - edge shifts , coherence peaks and their temperature evolution are observed in the tsss near the fermi energy ( figs . </S>",
    "<S> 4**b , c * * ) , evidence for the helical - cooper pairing and helical superconductivity in the 3ql film samples . </S>",
    "<S> the observed surface state superconducting gap value is about @xmath26 mev . </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to a gapless ( 7ql ) sample as shown in fig . 4**d**. </S>",
    "<S> the absence of hybridization gap at the dirac point reveals that surface state wavefunctions from the top and the interface surfaces are completely separated in real space . </S>",
    "<S> finite superconductivity signals are observed in the arpes spectra at both momenta of @xmath18 ( dirac surface states ) and @xmath20 ( bulk conduction states ) , which are found to be weaker than the gapped samples . </S>",
    "<S> the bi@xmath5se@xmath6 top surface s superconducting gap as a function of dirac point gap value ( surface - to - surface hybridization strength ) is shown in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 4**g , h * * in a ( surface and bulk ) band - resolved fashion . </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen that the induced superconducting gap near the top surface increases with a larger the dirac point hybridization gap , which is realized in thinner ti films . </S>",
    "<S> this observation is qualitatively consistent with the theoretical description of the superconducting proximity effect , where the cooper pair potential on the top surface is enhanced with the decreasing thickness of the normal metal . </S>",
    "<S> more interestingly , it can be seen that the surface state superconducting gap increases at a faster rate than that of the proximity gap on the bulk band . </S>",
    "<S> such contrast reveals that stronger surface - to - surface hybridization significantly enhances the helical pairing in the surface states on the top surface . </S>",
    "<S> these microscopics of the superconducting proximity effect observed in our data will be a valuable guide in properly interpreting the vast complexity of the transport data addressing the proximity effects in ti films and heterostructures .    </S>",
    "<S> * effects of time - reversal symmetry breaking on helical superconductivity *    in order to test the time - reversal invariant character of surface state superconductivity of bi@xmath5se@xmath6 required by its helical nature , we study manganese ( mn ) doped bi@xmath5se@xmath6 grown on top of nbse@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> mn atoms are introduced into bi@xmath5se@xmath6 throughout the film during the mbe growth . </S>",
    "<S> arpes studies on 4ql bi@xmath5se@xmath6 films with two different mn doping ( 4% and 10% ) levels are presented in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 5**a - f**. bulk manganese doping is found to hole dope the system , thus bringing the chemical potential closer to the dirac point . in principle , mn impurities can affect the induced superconductivity in several different channels , all leading to the suppression of proximity superconductivity : the major effect is that mn impurities introduce ( either random or ordered ) magnetism into the ti , which is destructive to the helical pairing ; another minor effect , which can also contribute , is that impurities generate random disorder reducing the electron mean free path . as shown in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 5**a - f * * , the superconducting coherence peak is strongly suppressed in the heavily mn - doped samples . </S>",
    "<S> these momentum - resolved measurements allow us to isolate the strength of the effect on helical surface states and bulk bands , thus directly demonstrating that magnetic impurities lead to strong pairing breaking in both conventional and helical pairing channels . </S>",
    "<S> the complete suppression of superconductivity in the helical dirac surface states upon strong mn doping effectively drives a topological phase transition from a helical superconductor to a normal dirac metal state as seen in our data . a sample fabricated to lie near the critical point of this transition can host many exotic phenomena ( which will be discussed later in this paper ) .    </S>",
    "<S> * point - contact andreev - reflection transport *    in order to check that the top surface superconductivity is indeed a proximity effect , we use the well - established methodology of point - contact andreev reflection measurements to compare the induced gap values at the nbse@xmath5/bi@xmath5se@xmath6 heterointerface . </S>",
    "<S> the point - contact spectra on a nbse@xmath5/bi@xmath5se@xmath6 ( 16ql ) heterostructure sample are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 6**a**. at temperatures below the @xmath27 ( @xmath28 k ) of nbse@xmath5 , the differential conductance ( @xmath29 ) around zero bias increases as a result of the andreev reflection process , similar to the bare nbse@xmath5 spectra . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , a second differential conductance increase appears below @xmath30 k. the sharp rise of differential conductance corresponds to the energy gap of the superconducting layer . from the data , we obtain the larger gap ( @xmath31 ) changing from 0 to @xmath32 mv from 7.5 k to 3.0 k. the second gap ( @xmath33 ) feature changes from 0 to @xmath34 mv from 5.0 k to 3.0 k. similar two gap features </S>",
    "<S> have been observed in point - contact studies of ag / pb @xcite and si / nb @xcite interface samples and were attributed to the superconducting energy gap of the superconducting layer and the proximity induced gap in the normal metal layer at the n / s interface , respectively . injected electrons from the point - contact are andreev reflected inside the superconducting bi@xmath5se@xmath6 proximity layer if their energies are lower than the induced superconducting gap in bi@xmath5se@xmath6 . when their energies are above the induced gap @xmath35 but below the nbse@xmath5 superconducting gap @xmath36 , injected electrons are not affected by the order parameter in the bi@xmath5se@xmath6 layer but andreev reflected in the nbse@xmath5 region . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the edge around @xmath37 is likely due to the nbse@xmath5 gap , while the sharp edge around @xmath33 in the conductance spectrum is likely to reflect the induced gap in bi@xmath5se@xmath6 near the interface . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that unlike arpes , which is mostly sensitive to the top surface , the point - contact transport probes deeper into the superconductor , similar to the electron mean free path , which is estimated to be @xmath3816 nm in our films . </S>",
    "<S> the induced gap in bi@xmath5se@xmath6 at the bi@xmath5se@xmath6/nbse@xmath5 interface is @xmath380.8 mev at 3 k from the point - contact measurement , which is in reasonable agreement with the fitted gap value extracted from the arpes measurement ( see data on 3ql sample ) . </S>",
    "<S> our results thus suggest that the combination of arpes and point - contact transport together provides a powerful method for probing superconducting proximity effect which can be used to correlate the proximity gap on the top surface and the buried interface if film thickness is not too large ( not larger than the superconducting coherence length ) . </S>"
