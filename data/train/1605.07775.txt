    "in this paper , we study centers of planar polynomial hamiltonian systems in the real case . in particular we focus on isochronous centers .",
    "our main concern is the following conjecture stated by jarque and villadelprat in @xcite : let @xmath0 be a real polynomial hamiltonian vector field of the form : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a real polynomial in the variables @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the maximum degree of the polynomials @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the degree of the hamiltonian vector field . + * conjecture * : _ every center of a planar polynomial hamiltonian system of even degree is nonisochronous . _",
    "+ the conjecture is known to be true for quadratic systems thanks to a result of loud in @xcite and in the quartic case by a result of jarque - villadelprat in @xcite .",
    "the proof of jarque and villadelprat is based on a careful study of the bifurcations set and seems difficult to extend to an arbitrary degree . the conjecture is open for the other cases despite partial results in this direction obtain by b. schuman in @xcite using an explicit computation of the first coefficients of the birkhoff normal form and chen and al .",
    "@xcite proving what they call a _ weak version _ of the conjecture , i.e. that any vector fields having only even components is nonisochronous .",
    "+ different strategies can be used to go further toward this conjecture .",
    "a first class of methods can be called _ geometric _ and are related to some special features of hamiltonian or isochronous centers .",
    "we can mention for example the work of l. gavrilov @xcite and p. mardesic , c. rousseau and b. toni @xcite . up to now , these methods are unable to reproduce some special results obtained by b. schuman @xcite for classes of polynomial vector fields of arbitrary degree .",
    "another class of methods can be called _ analytic _ and are more or less all dealing with the computations of quantities which be obtained algorithmically like _ period constants _",
    "@xcite and coefficients of normal forms @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , such methods are usually assumed to be _ intractable _ when one is dealing with a vector field of arbitrary degree ( see for example @xcite p.337 ) .",
    "this is indeed the case when one has no informations on the algebraic structure of these coefficients .",
    "then one is reduced to compute grobner bases or to use the elimination method .",
    "however , one is quickly limited by the computational complexity and the memory size need to perform these computations .",
    "existing results are restricted to polynomials of order @xmath7 . +",
    "a natural problem is then to look for methods allowing us to bypass these technical limitations .",
    "however , one can efficiently obtain more information on the structure of these coefficients .",
    "the idea is to separate in these coefficients what is _ universal _ and what is not .",
    "in this paper , we bypass this problem using the formalism of _ moulds _ introduced by jean ecalle ( see @xcite , @xcite ) and a particular object attached to a vector field called the _ correction _ defined by ecalle and vallet in @xcite . in particular , we obtain a partial answer to the conjecture for arbitrary degree . + it is well known that isochronicity of a real center is equivalent to its linearisability ( see @xcite , theorem 3.3 , p.12 ) .",
    "a main property of the correction is that it gives a very useful criterion for linearisability .",
    "indeed , a vector field is linearisable if and only if its correction is zero . as the correction possesses an algorithmic and explicit form which is easily calculable using mould calculus we are able to give more informations on the isochronous set .",
    "this strategy was already used by one of us in @xcite .",
    "+ in the following , we use the classical complex representation of real vector fields ( see @xcite ) .",

    "[ main1 ] let @xmath0 be a non trivial real hamiltonian vector field of even degree 2n given by : @xmath14 if @xmath0 satisfies one of the following conditions : + @xmath15 there exists @xmath16 such that @xmath17 for @xmath18 and @xmath19 , +",
    "@xmath20 @xmath17 for @xmath21 , + then the vector field is nonisochronous .    as a consequence",
    "we deduce that : @xmath22 are nonisochronous .",
    "+ as a corollary , we obtain the _ weak version _ of the jarque - villadelprat conjecture proved by x. chen and al .",
    "@xcite :    let @xmath0 be a non trivial real hamiltonian vector field of even degree 2n given by @xmath23 then @xmath0 is nonisochrnous .",
    "the proof follows easily from theorem [ main1 ] as for all @xmath24 , we have @xmath17 due to the fact that there exists no odd components .",
    "[ main2 ] let @xmath0 be a non trivial real hamiltonian vector field of the form : @xmath25 for @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "then @xmath0 is nonisochronous .    using this last theorem , _ without any conditions",
    "_ we have that : @xmath28 or more funny",
    "@xmath29    are nonisochronous .",
    "we see that theorem 1 and theorem 2 are complementary to each other .",
    "+ mixing the proofs of theorem 1 and theorem 2 we obtain :    [ thm4 ] let @xmath0 be a non trivial real polynomial hamiltonian vector field on the form : @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath27 and the sequence @xmath32 is defined by : @xmath33 and @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath0 is nonisochronous .",
    "a first example of nonisochronous vector field given by the last theorem is : @xmath36    [ thm3 ] let @xmath31 and @xmath27 , a real polynomial hamiltonian vector field denoted by @xmath0 on one of these two forms : @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 or @xmath40 where @xmath41 is nontrivial , @xmath42 , with @xmath43 , are nonisochronous .",
    "using theorem [ thm4 ] and theorem [ thm3 ] we easily deduce the classical result that homogeneous perturbations of a linear center are non isochronous ( see @xcite ) as well its generalization ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in part [ correction ] , we give following j. ecalle and b. vallet @xcite the definition of the correction of a vector field and remind some of its properties .",
    "we then look more specifically to the correction of polynomial real vector fields .",
    "we derive explicit formula allowing us to analyse its structure .",
    "+ in part [ geometry ] , we prove that the set of isochronous hamiltonian centers is an affine variety which can be explicitly described .",
    "we also prove that this variety is invariant under a non trivial torus action .",
    "+ part [ proof ] , we give the proofs of our main results and some technical lemmas .",
    "+ we then discuss several perspective for this work .    [ correction ]",
    "in this section , we remind the definition of the correction of a vector field following the work of j. ecalle and b. vallet @xcite . in particular , we give the mould expansion of the correction , which plays a central role in our approach to study the linearisability . it must be noted that all these computations can be made in arbitrary dimension .",
    "we denote by @xmath0 an analytic vector field on @xmath44 at @xmath45 : @xmath46 with @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "we can write the vector field @xmath0 in its _ prepared form _ :    a vector field @xmath0 is said @xmath49 if it is given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the linear part of @xmath0 on the form @xmath52 @xmath53 are homogeneous differential operator of degree @xmath54 in a given set @xmath55 which is completely defined by @xmath0 .    from the point of view of analysis , @xmath56 are more tractable .",

    "prove that the correction of a vector field admits a @xmath68 .",
    "+ precisely , let us denote by @xmath69 the set of the words given by the letters in @xmath55 using by the concatenation morphism @xmath70 on letters : @xmath71 for any integer @xmath72 .",
    "+ in the following , a word is denoted by @xmath73 or @xmath74 .",
    "the length of the word @xmath75 is @xmath72 .",
    "the word of length @xmath45 is denoted by @xmath76 .",

    "we denote : @xmath84    the correction can be written as ( @xcite , lemma 3.2 p.267 ) : @xmath85 or simply @xmath86 following ecalle s notations .",
    "+ the main point is that the mould @xmath87 can be computed _ algorithmically _ using a recursive formula on the length of words .",
    "precisely for all @xmath88 , let us denote by @xmath89 the quantity : @xmath90 where the @xmath91 is the usual scalar product on @xmath92 and @xmath93 is the eigensystem of @xmath51 .",
    "we can extend @xmath94 to a morphism from @xmath95 to @xmath96 .",
    "the quantity @xmath97 is the weight of the letter @xmath54 .",
    "we have the following theorem ( formula 3.42 in @xcite ) :    the mould of the correction is given by the formula for any word + @xmath98 : @xmath99    the proof of this theorem is nontrivial , it follows from @xmath100 for a vector field discussed in ( @xcite , prop 3.1 p.270 ) .",
    "the variance of a vector field gives many different way to compute the mould of the correction .",
    "+ the main consequence of the previous theorem is the _ universal _",
    "character of the mould of the correction .",
    "precisely , following the definition of universality used in @xcite , we have :    there exists a one parameter family of complex functions @xmath101 , @xmath102 such that for all @xmath0 the correction s mould @xmath87 defined on @xmath103 is given for all @xmath104 such that @xmath105 , @xmath102 and @xmath106 by @xmath107    this property is fundamental concerning our problem as the computation of these coefficients is done once and for all and does not depends on the value of the coefficients entering the polynomials but on the alphabet generated by the vector field . up to our knowledge",
    "only the mould formalism is able to produce such kind of coefficients allowing to write the correction ( this is not the case for example dealing with the classical lie framework ) .",
    "+ in the following , we give explicit expressions for @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "the following theorem concerns precisely the length 1,2 and 3 :    the universal correction functions @xmath111 , @xmath112 are defined by @xmath113 @xmath114    the proof is based on explicit computations which are summarized by the following lemmas whose proof are given in appendix .",
    "+ we can remark the values of the correction s mould depend on the weight of the letters .",
    "moreover ,    a word @xmath115 is said to be resonant if @xmath116    the mould @xmath117 verifies : + @xmath118 @xmath119=0 , + @xmath120if @xmath121 is non resonant , @xmath122 , + @xmath123if @xmath124 is such that there exists @xmath125 satisfying @xmath126 then @xmath127 .",

    "+ the alphabet generated by @xmath138 is given by @xmath139    all the letters in @xmath55 are non resonant so that the correction mould is always zero in length @xmath140 . in length",
    "@xmath141 however , some resonant combinations are possible .",
    "we have    [ cols=\"<,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     following the same lines as for theorem [ main2 ] , we see that the arguments based on the contributions of a given component belonging to @xmath142 are valid . in other words",
    ", we easily proved that in order to be linearisable , then one must have @xmath143 .",
    "the last argument concerning @xmath41 is also satisfies because the first contribution of @xmath41 to the correction is of length two and depth @xmath144 which is not disturbed by terms of the remaining family @xmath145 , @xmath146 as the minimal contribution of these terms to the correction is in depth @xmath147 .",
    "+ as a consequence , a vector fields of this type will be linearisable if @xmath148 . + by the same argument",
    ", we see that there exists no interaction between the family @xmath149 @xmath150 and the remaining one @xmath145 , @xmath151 .",
    "we deduce that a linearisable vector field of this type must satisfy @xmath152 .",
    "+ by induction , we easily deduce that a vector field of this type is linearisable if and only if all the components vanish .",
    "as by assumption we are considering a non trivial vector field , we are leaded to a contradiction and the vector field is necessarily nonisochronous .",
    "our main results give a very strong support to the jarque - villadelprat conjecture",
    ". the remaining cases always deal with the role of the resonant term in the deformation of the birkhoff s spheres .",
    "however , the phenomenon which is working for a quartic perturbation , which was precisely studied by jarque and villadelprat using geometrical methods , must applies in the same way for arbitrary degrees .",
    "indeed , as we have seem in our derivation of the main results , the algebraic structure of the correction during the cancellation process does not change and can be closely investigated .",
    "we have then some directions in order to solve completely the jarque - villadelprat conjecture :    * can we prove using an extension of our method the quartic case ?",
    "* can we extend the geometrical method of jarque - villadelprat in the cases which are let open by our work ? * can we prove the remaining cases using other methods ?",
    "we believe that a better understanding of the algebraic structure of the correction will be of importance in order to go further .",
    "a second aspect of our work is the explicit and algorithmic description of the isochronous center affine variety .",
    "as already said , we have informations about the growth of the degree and the coefficients entering in the description of this variety .",
    "a natural question is then to look for effective version of the hilbert basis theorem in order to get some informations about the minimal number of generators of the ideal .",
    "the isochronous centers seem to be more tractable than the usual center .",
    "however , it is clear that any advance in this direction will have consequences on the local 16th hilbert problem .",
    "indeed , the same kind of combinatoric and tools can be used to obtain analogous information for centers of polynomial vector fields ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in @xcite , the authors study isochronicity of complex hamiltonian systems when the linear part has for spectrum @xmath153 .",
    "our method and results extend naturally to this case and give an explicit and algorithmic description of the isochronous centers affine variety",

    "to prove the different results about the correction , we use another equivalent definition of the mould of the correction using a prenormal form ( see @xcite , p.267 * lemma 3.2 * ) : @xmath160 where @xmath161 , @xmath162 is the unit mould for composition , that is @xmath163 if @xmath164 and @xmath165 for @xmath166 .",
