    "one of the main quantities characterizing the physical and evolutionary status of galaxies is their star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "since long , many recipes to estimate the sfr , using data taken in various spectral windows , either in the continuum , or in emission lines , have been considered ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "one obvious possibility is to use uv radiation , since even in moderately actively star - forming systems , such as normal spirals , this radiation is expected to be dominated by short lived massive stars , which therefore should trace the past @xmath0 yr of star formation activity .",
    "the drawback of this approach is that the uv radiation is strongly affected by dust obscuration .",
    "the issue is particularly delicate because stars are formed in more - than - average dense regions , and therefore they are particularly affected by obscuration during their early evolution .",
    "indeed it is now well established that in ir bright galaxies , such as ulirgs or sub - mm selected high - z galaxies , the uv flux alone is hardly or not at all a reliable indicator of the sfr ( e.g. @xcite ) , and even in normal spirals it should be used with proper care @xcite .",
    "in particular , when dealing with the dust obscuration in the uv domain , ( i ) it has to be taken into account that the relative geometry of stars and dust depends on the age of the stars ( _ age - dependent extinction _ , @xcite ) , and",
    "( ii ) it has to be understood if the dust optical properties adopted to interpret the data are well representative of the particular system .",
    "actually , it is very difficult to disentangle from observation of external galaxies the effects of dust optical properties from those due to their complex geometry ( and possibly those due to the star formation history ) .",
    "it is therefore advisable to clearly distinguish the _ attenuation law _ of a galaxy from the _ extinction law _ of the dust .",
    "while the latter describes just the wavelength dependence of the optical properties of the dust mixture , the former is the ratio ( expressed in magnitudes ) between the observed and intrinsic starlight , as a function of wavelength .",
    "this would be a direct measure of the extinction law only if the stars were obscured by a thin screen of dust between them and the observer , in general an extremely idealized situation .    for our own and a few nearby galaxies ,",
    "the extinction law of the dust can be measured directly from observations of background stars , where indeed the dust acts as a foreground screen .",
    "the differences found between the shapes of the extinction curves of the galaxy , the large magellanic cloud and the small magellanic cloud below @xmath12600   @xcite are often ascribed to the different metallicities in these systems , covering the range @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite have analysed the dust attenuation in starburst galaxies . in this case , the derivation of the intrinsic extinction is not direct , since one measures the integrated light of the whole system , where stars and dust are mixed in a complex way . from the optical and uv spectra of a sample of uv - bright starbursts they derive an average attenuation law (",
    "_ calzetti law _ ) characterized by the absence of the 2175   feature and a far - uv slope ( above the bump ) shallower than that of the milky way extinction law .",
    "@xcite argued that the observed shape of the calzetti law can only be explained with dust that lacks the 2175    feature in its extinction curve .",
    "however they only considered clumping of dust , not of stars , and assumed a spatial distribution for stars independent of stellar age .",
    "indeed a completely different conclusion has been reached by @xcite , by means of the first spectral synthesis model for the entire uv to ir domain taking into account the effect of age - dependent extinction ( grasil , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) have shown that this more realistic geometry can explain the differences between the observed attenuation law of starburst galaxies and the galactic extinction law , even adopting the galactic cirrus optical properties .",
    "note that this by no means demonstrates that the optical properties of dust in starbursts are well represented by the average cirrus dust in the galaxy , but rather that any difference may be completely masked by geometrical effects . in this interpretation ,",
    "the attenuation law of a specific stellar system arises , via the age - dependent extinction , from a complex blending of optical properties of dust , star formation history and relative geometry of stars and dust , including clumping of both components .",
    "the relative importance of these ingredients is a function of the evolutionary status of the galaxy . in very active systems",
    "the first ingredient is of little relevance , because much of the intrinsic optical - uv starlight is produced by stars embedded in molecular clouds , completely opaque at these wavelengths ( see section [ sec_att_law ] ) .",
    "conversely , more gently star forming galaxies , such as normal spirals , are expected to be better candidates to investigate variations of dust properties , provided that a sufficiently realistic geometry is used in their modelling .",
    "further clues on these complexities can be derived considering that different classes of galaxies lie in different regions of the plane defined by the ratio of ir and uv fluxes @xmath3 and the uv spectral slope @xmath4 ( or , equivalently , a uv colour ) .",
    "@xcite found that uv bright starburst galaxies follow a well defined correlation between the @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "these authors noted that their relation implies an attenuation law with a slope around 1600   very different from the milky way extinction law , and more similar to the calzetti law ( that was derived using some galaxies belonging to the same sample ) .",
    "also @xcite explained the @xmath3 vs @xmath4 relation in these objects using a featureless power - law extinction law .",
    "if the correlation found by @xcite were a general property of galaxies , it would allow to reliably estimate the sfr of galaxies from uv data alone .",
    "however it is now established that this relationship is not a general property .",
    "in particular , luminous ir galaxies have @xmath3 ratios orders of magnitude higher than uv bright starbursts with the same @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "thus for these objects the procedure would lead to severe underestimates of the actual sfr .    on the other hand , @xcite and @xcite collected data from different uv space experiments and found that normal spirals are even redder than the @xmath5 vs @xmath4 relation found for uv bright starbursts .",
    "@xcite , using the simple model by @xcite , ascribed this difference to the lower ratio between the recent over average star formation activity .",
    "note that they used the same featureless extinction law assumed for starburst galaxies .",
    "the _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( _ galex _ ) @xcite provides very useful data to study this problem .",
    "in particular , the uv slope can be estimated from data taken in the nuv and fuv _ galex _ bands .",
    "it is worth noticing that the nuv filter , centered at 2310  , is strongly affected by the presence of the 2175   bump in the mw extinction law . @xcite and @xcite ( see also @xcite ) confirmed with first _ galex _ observations that normal spirals do not follow the @xmath5 vs @xmath4 relation found for uv bright starbursts and that the position of objects in the diagram depend on the selection criteria .",
    "finally , @xcite found that also star - forming regions within ngc5194 do not follow the above starburst relation .",
    "in this paper we use the relatively sophisticated spectral synthesis model grasil to interpret the uv and fir properties of normal spiral galaxies .",
    "we will show that these properties can be explained without invoking strongly non - standard dust , provided that a sufficiently detailed ( but realistic ) description of the geometry of the system is employed .",
    "conversely , these properties would require in some sense extreme assumptions about the dust composition if a simplistic geometry were adopted .",
    "in particular , we will show the effect of taking into account that in normal spirals stars younger than @xmath6 yr are confined in a thin disc with a smaller scale - height than older stars and diffuse medium .",
    "the different attenuations suffered by young and old stars have a relevant impact on uv colours , a fact that has not been considered in any of the above mentioned works ( see @xcite for an analysis of the effect on dust attenuation estimation ) .",
    "we will also discuss the role of the initial mass function ( imf ) showing that a imf with less massive stars than a salpeter one can be more consistent with data .",
    "in particular , we will show that this makes the cirrus more efficient in attenuating young stars and reddening the final seds .",
    "this paper has the following structure . in sections [ sec_data ] and [ sec_obsirx ]",
    "we describe the data sample we consider for our analysis . in section [ sec_grasil ]",
    "we describe our spectro - photometric model for dusty galaxies , grasil . in section [ sec_geo ]",
    "we apply our code to study different geometrical configurations of dust and stars and the relevance of an age - dependent extinction to explain the data .",
    "furthermore , in section [ sec_att_law ] we discuss the attenuation law resulting from our models , and in section [ sec_imf ] we discuss the role of the imf .",
    "finally , in section [ sec_discus ] we summarise and discuss the results of this work .",
    "the galaxy sample we consider in our analysis is derived from the first observations of the _ galaxy evolution explorer _ mission and from iras observations .",
    "the _ galex _",
    "data are photometric measurement in two ultraviolet bands : the far - uv band ( fuv , 13501750  , @xmath7  ) and the near - uv band ( nuv , 17502750  , @xmath8  ) .",
    "the sample was presented in @xcite and @xcite ; it consists in 59 galaxies selected on the basis of the nuv flux ( @xmath9 mag , ab system ) . here",
    ", we only summarize the main information about the sample , more details on the sample can be found in @xcite .",
    "the galaxy fluxes in the sample were extracted from the _ galex _ all - sky imaging survey @xcite and corrected for the foreground galactic extinction using the @xcite dust map and the @xcite extinction curve .",
    "sources were identified using the simbad , 2mass and pgc catalogs ; the same catalogs were used to determine the morphological types of the sample galaxies .",
    "two ellipticals , four seyferts and one qso were discarded .",
    "the fir fluxes of the remaining sources were taken from the iras faint source catalog ( version 2 ) @xcite and the scan processing and integration facility ( scanpi ) at 60 and 100 @xmath10 m .",
    "we excluded from the sample multiple uv sources not resolved as single objects by iras and sources contaminated by cirrus .",
    "complementary data in visible are taken from hyperleda , while @xmath11 magnitudes from 2mass .      in this paper",
    "we will focus on the relation between @xmath3 and @xmath4 , already called irx-@xmath4 diagram . for this purpose",
    "we will express the ratio @xmath3 with the ratio between @xmath13 , i.e. the total dust emitted flux estimated from iras 60 and 100 @xmath10 m fluxes following the prescription of @xcite , and @xmath14 , the observed flux in the _ galex _ fuv band .",
    "moreover , we will express the uv spectral slope @xmath4 with the nuv@xmath15fuv colour .",
    "the irx-@xmath4 diagram as seen by _",
    "galex _ for these nuv selected galaxies was presented in @xcite and @xcite . here",
    "we would like to underline the effect of the star formation activity on the diagram .",
    "as already mentioned , @xcite suggested that the displacement between normal spiral galaxies and starburst in the @xmath3 vs uv colour is due to the different ratio between the recent over average star formation activity .",
    "this ratio is quantified by the birthrate parameter @xmath16 @xcite , defined as the ratio between the present star formation rate ( sfr ) and the mean sfr ( @xmath17 ) in the past : @xmath18    as for the present star formation rate , it can be derived from the nuv luminosity , properly corrected for dust attenuation using the ratio ir / uv . from our ssp library ( see section [ sec_grasil ] ) , we computed the nuv luminosity of a constant sfr lasting 100 myr , assuming a salpeter imf from 0.1 to 100 m@xmath19 .",
    "the relation between sfr and @xmath20 we got is : @xmath21    as discussed by many authors ( e.g. @xcite ) , the ratio ir / uv is a good estimator of the uv attenuation .",
    "we used here the relation proposed by @xcite : @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",
    "finally , the mean star formation rate can be derived from the @xmath11 luminosity as shown by @xcite .",
    "the resulting mean value of @xmath16 for our nuv selected sample is @xmath24 , typical of normal late type spirals , confirmed by the morphological classification ( see @xcite for discussion ) .",
    "also the infrared colours of our sample objects indicate a mild level star formation activity .",
    "diagram for the nuv selected sample . filled triangles",
    "are objects with a birthrate parameter @xmath16 larger than 1.0 ; empty triangles represent objects with @xmath25 , while stars represent objects with @xmath26 .",
    "the solid line represents the meurer et al s uv bright starburst sequence converted into galex bands ( see the text for more datails ) . ]",
    "the position of sample galaxies in the irx-@xmath4 diagram is shown in figure [ fig_irxuv_oss ] , where we have used different symbols for objects having @xmath27 , @xmath25 and @xmath28 .    in the same diagram",
    "we show the uv bright starburst sequence of the @xcite sample where the uv spectral index was converted into the fuv@xmath15nuv colour following @xcite . thus the starburst relation is given by : @xmath29    it is worth noting that ( i ) most of the galaxies have a redder fuv@xmath15nuv colour than what expected by the starburst relation , regardless their birthrate parameter value ; ( ii ) galaxies with a small birthrate parameter are not systematically redder than more active galaxies .",
    "these two statements contrast with what predicted by @xcite , i.e. that galaxies with birtrate @xmath30 should follow the starburst relation , while galaxies with @xmath31 should be redder .",
    "there are some explanations for this disagreement .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the nuv flux used in the computation of the birthrate parameter is produced by all stellar populations with an age smaller than @xmath32 100 myr , so the present sfr is estimated with an average over the last @xmath32 100 myr . in presence of a star formation history with significant variations in this interval of time , the sfr estimated with the nuv flux could be not representative of the instantaneous sfr . however , the observed fuv@xmath15nuv colour is due to a complex interplay between the star formation history _ and _ the effect of the dust attenuation ( as discussed in the following sections ) ,",
    "so it is not clear if our birthrate parameter estimation is fully representative for the irx-@xmath4 diagram .",
    "indeed , @xcite analized the relation between the distance from the starburst relation and the birthrate parameter computed using the h@xmath33 flux ( thus using an estimate of instantaneous sfr ) , but they found only a weak correlation for normal star - forming galaxies .",
    "another possible factor in this disagreement is that the equation [ equ_meurer_rel ] for the meurer et al .",
    "sample was obtained by translating the meurer s definiton of @xmath4 into the fuv@xmath15nuv colour , and not by observing the same sample with _",
    "galex_. indeed , @xcite proposed an alternative conversion of the uv spectral index into the fuv - nuv which provides a redder colour for the uv bright starburst sequence .",
    "thus , we think that the equation [ equ_meurer_rel ] should be verified with _ galex _ observations .",
    "we compute the seds of galaxies using our code grasil .",
    "grasil is a population synthesis model to predict the time dependent seds of galaxies from far - uv to radio , including state - of - the - art treatment of all relevant aspects dust reprocessing @xcite , production of radio photons by thermal and non - thermal processes @xcite and nebular lines emission @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to the original papers for details , but we summarize for convenience the main features .",
    "the starting input for grasil is the history of star formation and chemical enrichment histories of the system .",
    "this is computed by an external code , which can result from a complex scenario for the formation of galaxies in a cosmological context ( e.g. @xcite ) , or a standard chemical evolution model for the formation of a single galaxy . here , as in @xcite , we follow the latter approach .",
    "our chemical evolution model is a standard implementation of a one zone open model including infall of primordial gas ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the parameters regulating the star formation history are the baryonic mass of the galaxy ( @xmath34 ) , the gas infall time scale ( @xmath35 ) , and the star formation efficiency ( @xmath36 ) of the assumed schmidt law .",
    "once the star formation and chemical enrichment histories of a galaxy are given , grasil computes the interaction between the stellar radiation and dust using a relatively realistic and flexible geometry for both stars and dust .",
    "one of the most important distinctive features of grasil is that it included , for the first time , the effect of _ age - dependent extinction _ of stellar populations ( younger stellar generations are more affected by dust obscuration ) , due to the fact that stars form in a denser than average environment .",
    "in particular , new stars are born inside mcs and progressively get rid of them , either because they escape or because the clouds are destroyed .",
    "this is described in grasil as follows .",
    "if @xmath37 is the timescale for the process , the fraction of starlight radiated inside the clouds at time @xmath38 after they formed is given by @xmath39 in practise , 100% of the stars younger than @xmath37 are considered to radiate inside the mcs , and this percentage goes linearly to 0% in @xmath40 .",
    "the timescale @xmath37 is a fundamental parameter , which was found longer in an handful of well studied local starburst than in normal disc - like galaxies by a sed fitting procedure @xcite .    the galaxies geometry in grasil is generally described as a superposition of an exponential disc component and a bulge component",
    ", the latter modelled by a king profile .    the stars and",
    "dust density in the exponential disc component is give by the following equation : @xmath41 with @xmath42 the central density , @xmath43 and @xmath44 the scalelength along the radial and normal directions .",
    "the code allows to specify different values for @xmath43 and @xmath44 for stars and dust .    up to now , we have only considered the contribution of molecular clouds to the age - dependent extinction , which is indeed the most prominent , at least in very active systems . in this paper",
    "we show that to interpret the uv spectral shape of spiral galaxies , it is necessary a further step , namely to consider the fact that mcs are concentrated in the galactic plane , and therefore the same is true for young stars already free from their parent mc . as a result , though free from mcs obscuration",
    ", these stars are more extincted by the diffuse medium than older populations .",
    "we model this geometrical configuration by dividing the star content of the galaxy into two populations , according to their age .",
    "if @xmath45 is the timescale on which young stars stay concentrated on the galactic plane , we assume two different scalelengths sets ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) for stars younger or older than @xmath45 .    the total gas mass ( diffuse+mcs ) of the galaxy at time @xmath46 is given by the chemical evolution model .",
    "the relative fraction of molecular gas is a free parameter of the code , @xmath47 .",
    "the total molecular mass , @xmath48 is then subdivided into spherical clouds of mass and radius , @xmath49 and @xmath50 . then , the radiative transfer of starlight through the mcs and diffuse ism is solved .",
    "the ratio between gas mass and dust mass @xmath51 is assumed to scale linearly with the metallicity of the residual gas and @xmath52 for @xmath53 .",
    "this ratio plus @xmath54 determine the optical depth of the clouds .",
    "note that in grasil , the predicted sed depends on @xmath49 and @xmath50 only through the combination @xmath54 , which is the true free parameter .    for the dust composition ,",
    "we adopt a mixture of graphite and silicate grains and pahs . in general , the size distributions are adjusted to match the extinction and emissivity properties of the local diffuse ism in the galaxy ( for more details see @xcite and @xcite for the improved model of pahs ) , but we have also considered other possibilities ( see section [ sec_geo ] ) .    the ssps included in grasil are based on the padova stellar models , and cover a large range of ages and metallicities .",
    "starlight reprocessing from dust in the envelopes of agb stars is included directly into the ssps , as described by @xcite .",
    "to interpret the irx-@xmath4 diagram , we computed different sets of disc galaxy models .    for simplicity , here we consider only two star formation histories ( figure [ fig_sfr ] ) with birthrate parameters @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "these values span most of the observed spread of the birthrate parameters in the sample .",
    "we computed the sed at a galactic age of 10 gyr for all models .",
    ", dot - dashed line is for @xmath55 . ]      to illustrate the effects of relative star - dust geometry , and in particular the age - dependent extinction , we consider four sets of model .",
    "for all models of this section ( except the last one ) , we assume a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) .    in the first set ( set a ) we neglect any age - dependent extinction , i.e. all the dust is assumed to stay in the diffuse medium ( cirrus ) , without molecular clouds , and the stars are smoothly distributed within this medium independently of their age .",
    "the geometrical distributions of stars and dust are exponential discs ( for clarity , we do not include a bulge component ) , described by eq .",
    "[ eq_expdisc ] with scale values reported in table [ tab_scaleval ] .",
    "the set consists of a sequence of models with increasing gas ( and therefore dust ) content .",
    "the parameter describing this sequence is the cirrus optical depth at 1@xmath10 m from the center along the polar axis , ranging from 0.05 to 6.4 , and doubling between one model and the other .",
    "the models were computed for two choices of dust composition ; one reproducing the mw extinction law , the other reproducing the extinction law of smc ( dust composition from @xcite ) .",
    "the position of models in the irx-@xmath4 diagram is shown in figure [ fig_mod_disc ] ( models connected with solid lines have a mw dust ; those connected with dotted lines have a smc dust ) , where nuv and fuv magnitudes have been computed taking into account the filter transmissions .",
    "all models in figure [ fig_mod_disc ] are face - on , i.e. with the polar axis parallel to the line of sight .",
    "the two arrows shows the fuv@xmath15nuv colour of dust - free models for the two star formation histories .",
    "note that the dust - free fuv@xmath15nuv colour is redder than the zero - extinction color for the uv bright starburst sequence due to the assumed continuous star formation .",
    ".geometrical parameters for the models .",
    "note that set b models do not have diffuse dust , thus they do not depend on @xmath43 or @xmath44 . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     models with mw dust move in the diagram at nearly constant fuv@xmath15nuv colour as the dust content increases , while those with smc dust become redder and redder .",
    "the lack of reddening for the mw dust case is due to the presence of the 2175   bump in the extinction law that affects strongly the nuv band .",
    "in fact , the extinction in nuv is actually higher than in the fuv ( @xmath57 ) for a mw dust . from the figure ,",
    "it is clear that a dust mixture somewhat intermediate between the mw and the smc and more similar to the latter could reproduce the data points .",
    "a similar result was found by @xcite , investigating the variation of the uv spectral index .",
    "they also found that this result does not depend on the relative geometry of dust and stars , which however was always age independent .    ) and set a models .",
    "connected dots are for models with increasing optical depth of the diffuse medium . ]    in the second set of models ( set b ) we begin to explore the role of the age - dependent extinction due to molecular clouds . in this set",
    "we try to reproduce the observed irx-@xmath4 diagram of the uv selected sample , assuming that all the gas is arranged in clouds obscuring young stars with no gas left in the cirrus . here",
    "the sequence consists in models with increasing escape time , while the total amount of gas is that predicted by the chemical evolution code .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig_irxuv_mc ] : solid lines connect models ( represented by circles or empty squares ) with the same star formation history and gas amounts ; the escape time increases from 0.5 to 64 myr doubling between one model and the other .",
    "the optical depth of mcs in the models is @xmath58 at 1 @xmath10 m ; however , the position on the irx-@xmath4 diagram does not depend on the value of @xmath59 provided that @xmath60 , because mcs are completely opaque at the _ galex _ wavelengths . above this value ,",
    "changes in the optical depth of mcs affect only the shape of the ir sed .",
    "it is also important to notice that the position of this set on the irx-@xmath4 diagram are independent of the dust properties .",
    "in fact , fuv and nuv fluxes depend only on the escape time and the star formation history , while the @xmath13 is nothing more than the bolometric luminosity of stars inside mcs .    ) and models with varing @xmath37 ( set b ) .",
    "connected dots are for models with @xmath61 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 , 32 and 64 myr ( the reddest models ) . ]    to reproduce the reddest objects , very large values of the timescale with which new stars get rid of their parent mcs are required , ( @xmath62 myr ) .",
    "this solution is unsatisfactory on astrophysical grounds , since stars whose lifetime is about one order of magnitude shorter than this are commonly observed in optical bands in quiescently star forming galaxies .",
    "moreover , the ir dust emission for these models is hotter than the observed sed : for all these models @xmath63 , while the observed mean value is @xmath64 with objects having down to @xmath65 .",
    "this is a consequence of the assumed geometrical configuration of the dust that feels a stronger radiation field than in the diffuse medium , resulting in a higher temperature and hotter ir emission .",
    "our interpretation of the above results is that the assumption of age - independent extinction for all star populations outside mcs is not satisfactory .",
    "the very long escape timescale from parent clouds tries to mimic the fact that in real spiral galaxies stars younger than @xmath6 yr are still very much concentrated in the galactic plane , and therefore they are more affected by extinction from the diffuse ism than older ones .",
    "thus , in the third set of models ( set c ) we explored the effect of the smaller scale - height of young star distribution in the disc . here",
    "we assume that the dust is present only in the cirrus ( no",
    "mc , like set a ) and that stars younger than an age @xmath45 have a smaller scale - height than older stars , while the dust scale - height is in between .",
    "the scale - heights of different components are reported in table [ tab_scaleval ] .",
    "we computed sed models for different values of @xmath45 , ranging from 25 myr to 200 myr .",
    "as in set a , we computed sequences of models with increasing dust content ; the cirrus optical depth at 1@xmath10 m from the center along the polar axis goes from 0.05 to 6.4 , and doubling between from one model and the other .",
    "the models were computed for the same dust compositions of set a.        the comparison between the nuv selected sample and set c models is shown in figure [ fig_irxuv_sal ] . for clarity , we showed the mw dust models and only one smc dust model sequence .",
    "it is worth noting that , contrary to what happens in the set a models , increasing the diffuse medium optical thickness produces a reddening also in mw dust models .",
    "the results show that when the optical depth is low the uv sed is dominated by the young population , and the models move at constant fuv@xmath15nuv as the optical depth increases because the geometry is mixed .",
    "when the optical depth is high enough to attenuate considerably the young population , the contribution of stars older than @xmath45 ( that have a larger scale - height ) becomes not negligible and the total sed becomes redder .",
    "however , models are still bluer than the observed sample .",
    "it should also be noted that models with a larger value of @xmath45 have a larger @xmath66 ( for the same value of fuv@xmath15nuv ) . in fact , if @xmath45 is larger , the young population enbedded near the galactic plane is more luminous , thus a larger attenuation is needed to make the old stellar population contribution non negligiable .    in the last set of models ( set d ) we consider the combined effect of the smaller scale - height of young star distribution in the disc and the age - dependent extinction due to molecular clouds .",
    "here we assume the same dust - star configuration used in set c , i.e. with young stars with a small scale - height , but with the presence of molecular clouds with an escape time fixed to @xmath37=4 myr .",
    "again we computed sequences of models with increasing dust content in the cirrus ( dust content of mcs is fixed ) .",
    "the cirrus optical depth at 1@xmath10 m from the center along the polar axis goes from 0.05 to 6.4 ( except for the first models where we assume no cirrus ) , and doubling between from one model and the other .",
    "= 4 myr ( set d ) .",
    "connected dots are for models with increasing optical depth of the diffuse medium . ]",
    "it is worth noting that the presence of mcs increases the effect of cirrus dust and the models are more compatible with observations .",
    "in fact , the mc obscuration removes a significant fraction of uv luminosity from the young population ; thus the optical thickness of cirrus needed to attenuate the young population outside mcs enough to make relevant the contribution of older stars is smaller than in set c , making the models redder .",
    "in conclusion , in this section we have shown that inferences on the dust optical properties of galaxies derived from the analysis of the irx-@xmath4 diagram are dangerous , if the models are too schematic .",
    "in particular , the common ( and unrealistic ) assumption that starlight suffer the same reprocessing independently of the star age is strongly misleading .        .",
    "our data enable us to study the attenuation curves only in the uv .",
    "thus we can not confirm nor disprove the deviations predicted by our models with respect to the mw extinction law and the calzetti law above 2500 a. ]    for a better understanding of the issue , we also analysed the attenuation law resulting from our models . the attenuation law @xmath67 in simulated galaxies is thus defined as the difference in magnitudes of the luminosity @xmath68 of models with and without dust .",
    "figure [ fig_curv_att ] compares the attenuation curves for simulated galaxies of sets c and with the attenuation law from @xcite and the mw extinction law .",
    "all curves are normalized to unity at @xmath69  .",
    "the shadowed region shows the range of variation of the attenuation laws of the models with the variation of the parameters ; the attenuation laws plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig_curv_att ] are only for models with mw dust .    for set c models ,",
    "the one with the larger bump in the attenuation law is the model with the smaller dust content . as the optical depth of dust increases , the bump strength decreases until it vanishes completely for highest optical depths .",
    "in fact , as the optical depth of dust increases , a growing fraction of the observed uv is produced by the older stellar population ; this emission can fill the absorption feature in the sed of young population .    for set d models , indeed ,",
    "the bump in attenuation law vanishes .",
    "in fact , in this case the attenuation is mostly due to mcs that are opaque at these wavelengths . consider a system with two stellar populations , younger stars inside mcs and stars outside .",
    "the observed luminosity @xmath68 is given by : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the luminosity fraction of stars inside mcs , @xmath72 is the attenuation of stars inside mcs , @xmath73 is the one for stars outside , and @xmath74 is the unextincted luminosity if the optical depth of mcs is very high and that toward the diffuse star population is very low , we have @xmath75 .",
    "thus @xmath67 is mostly independent of the dust properties and depends mostly on the luminosity fraction .",
    "the prediction of a decreasing bump strength with increasing attenuation was also found in other works in literature ( e.g. @xcite ) , even in the case where an uniform stellar population is assumed ( @xcite ) .",
    "note also that @xcite found that the seds of nuv selected normal spiral galaxies show an attenuation law with a reduced 2175   bump .",
    "however , the above authors found that the bump strength seems to increase with increasing attenuation .",
    "this is probably due to the presence in their sample of a number of ir selected galaxies with a blue fuv@xmath15nuv colour and high dust attenuation .",
    "finally , it could be noted that the attenuation laws from models decreases more steeply than the mw extinction law beyond 2500  .",
    "this is due to the contribution ( increasing with the wavelength ) from older stars which suffer a much smaller attenuation than young stars thus decreasing the attenuation of the whole system . at this stage",
    "we can not verify whether such deviation is actually observed in our galaxies , as a comparison with data would require assumptions on the intrinsic , dust  free seds of normal spirals , which , at optical wavebands , strongly depend on their star formation history .",
    "we also explored the possibility of using a different initial mass function to interpret the observations .",
    "several works ( see @xcite and references therein ) claim that the properties of normal disc galaxies are not well reproduced using a salpeter imf . in particular , with a salpeter imf , chemical evolution models for disc galaxies produce higer mass to light ratios than the observed ones , and a too high efficiency in metal production .",
    "these problems can be alleviated by a imf having a shallower slope at low masses and a steeper one at high masses . among others ,",
    "@xcite proposed an imf with the above characteristic , defined as ( we use the formulation given by @xcite ) :    @xmath76    we computed an ssp spectra library using the above formulated kroupa imf and compared the resulting uv sed evolution with the one obtained using a sapleter imf .",
    "in the _ galex _ spectral window , the uv sed of young ssps is dominated by the more massive stars ( @xmath77m@xmath19 ) , whose _",
    "colour does not depend on the mass . as a consequence , the uv spectral slope ( or uv colours ) of young ssps with salpeter and kroupa imf",
    "are very similar , despite the different high mass slope . with our ssp spectra we found that the fuv@xmath15nuv colour in the two imf cases always differs less than 0.03 mag , for all stellar ages younger than @xmath0 yr .",
    "however , the difference in the imf slope at high masses gives a different evolution of the uv luminosity between the two imfs .",
    "indeed , figure [ fig_fluxssp ] shows that the uv flux for a kroupa imf decreases with the age of the population with a slower rate than that corresponding to a salpeter imf , as @xmath78 and @xmath79 respectively , between 3 and 100 myr . as a consequence ,",
    "the fuv@xmath15nuv dust - free colour of a galaxy with @xmath56 is around 0 assuming a salpeter imf ( figure [ fig_irxuv_sal ] ) , and 0.2 with a kroupa imf .    .",
    "]    thus we re - computed the spiral galaxies models with the age - dependent scale - height ( like set c in the previous section ) but adopting a kroupa imf .",
    "the resulting irx-@xmath4 diagram is shown in figure [ fig_irxuv_kro ] , illustrating that the models well compare with observed values .",
    "the results show that the imf slope has an effect on the final uv colour producing redder models that agree in a better way with the observations than set c models .",
    "the larger reddening of these models respect salpeter imf based ones is simply due to the difference in the relative contribution of old ( and less obscured ) and young ( and more obscured ) stars to uv luminosity .",
    "in fact , young star populations with kroupa imf have less massive stars ( and a lower uv luminosity ) respect to populations with salpeter imf ; thus , similarly to what happens in the set d models , a smaller obscuration by the cirrus is needed to make the model redder .    finally , we computed the attenuation laws of figure [ fig_curv_att ] with the kroupa imf .",
    "however we found that there is no visible change in the attenuation laws between models with the two different imf ( salpeter and kroupa ) used in this work .",
    "in previous sections we investigated the role of various physical and geometrical factors in the relation between the reddening of the uv _ galex _ colour and the attenuation . our relatively realistic modelling allows a proper discussion of the effect of the geometrical distribution of stars and the dust , and of the effect of the imf on the attenuation properties of normal spiral galaxies .",
    "the _ galex _ data are in principle very sensitive to the dust properties because the nuv band is strongly affected by the presence of the 2175   bump in the extinction law ; e.g. the extinction in nuv is actually slightly higher than in the fuv for a mw dust . for this reason ,",
    "such data could be used to derive the dust properties .    under the ( unrealistic ) assumption that stars suffer an extinction independent of their age ( set a , figure [ fig_mod_disc ] )",
    ", it is not possible to produce a reddening in a star population with a mw dust , regardless the relative geometry of dust and stars .",
    "this result confirms the findings of @xcite . under this assumption , the irx-@xmath4 diagram for normal galaxies drawn by @xcite and @xcite , and confirmed by _",
    "data @xcite , would imply a strong reduction of the 2175   bump in the extinction law of these galaxies ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite analysed the observed relation in an empirical way , using an average attenuation law rather than a radiation transport model .",
    "fitting the uv , the optical seds and the ir luminosity of the uv selected sample , they found that the mean strength of the 2175   bump in the attenuation law characterizing this sample is around half of the strength in the mw extinction law .",
    "however , as the authors underline , this approach can not determine if the small bump strength is due to a dust characteristic or a geometrical effect .",
    "using our radiation transport model we have shown that , indeed , the observed relation can be explained without the need of dust properties different from the mw diffuse medium . this result can be obtained taking into account the fact that young stars suffer a higher dust attenuation with respect to older stars ( age - dependent extinction ) .",
    "we have shown ( set b , figure [ fig_irxuv_mc ] ) that in the case with all the dust in molecular clouds obscuring stars younger than a given age , the observed _ galex _ irx-@xmath4 diagram can be fairly well reproduced .",
    "the important point of this result is that in this case the fuv@xmath15nuv colour is completely independent of the extinction law ( because the mc are supposed to be optically thick ) so it can be obtained with every kind of dust .",
    "it is worth stressing that such geometrical effect could completely wash out the effect of optical properties of the dust , and undermine the idea that the irx-@xmath4 diagram could be used to derive the dust properties .",
    "however the above case is extreme and not very realistic .",
    "moreover we found that the timescale on which young stars must be attenuated to explain redder galaxies is significantly larger ( 50 myr or more ) than the typical time over which young stars get rid of their parental clouds ( few myr ) .",
    "anyway , the good reproduction of the observed relation suggests that some form of age - dependent extinction has to be in place .",
    "we interpreted this result as the effect of the different scale - height of young and old stars in spiral galaxies . by taking into account that the stars are born near the galactic plane and therefore suffer a higher dust attenuation than older stars which are distributed in a broader way , we have shown ( set c , figure [ fig_irxuv_sal ] ) that it is possible to obtain a significant reddening also in the case of a dust with a prominent 2175   bump .",
    "it is worth noting that the well known different distribution of young and old stars in discs was taken into account only in few population synthesis models ( e.g. @xcite ) but its effect on the uv colour was never investigated .",
    "the timescale required by new stars to leave the galactic plane needed to explain the observed irx-@xmath4 relation is around 100 myr .",
    "this is in keeping with observations in our own galaxy , according to which stars younger than @xmath32 150 myr have a much smaller scale - height than older ones @xcite .",
    "moreover , our results ( set d , figure [ fig_irxuv_sal_mc ] ) show that the combination of molecular clouds obscuration and the age dependent scale - height of stars can reproduce most of the observed irx-@xmath4 .    in this geometry , as the young stars become more and more obscured at increasing the dust amount , the nuv flux become dominated by the older stars , while the fuv is still mostly provided by younger ones .",
    "therefore , the fuv@xmath15nuv colour is , in this framework , the result of the age dependent obscuration of the different populations rather than the reddening properties of the dust .",
    "moreover , our results show that the lack of correlation between the birthrate parameter and the distance from the starburst relation could be ascribed at least in part to the variation of @xmath45 , the timescale required by new stars to leave the galactic plan .",
    "we underline that our results do not rule out that the intrinsic optical properties of dust in different galaxies can be substantially different from those of the average mw dust .",
    "this is indeed in our view a likely possibility , in general .",
    "however , we have demonstrated that conclusions on this issue can be seriously affected by the use of too simple models . in particular , the effects of dust properties in datasets such as those considered in this work are probably overwhelmed by the age dependent geometry .",
    "we have also shown that the imf can have a role in shaping the irx-@xmath4 diagram .",
    "even if the uv colour of a simple stellar population does not depend on the imf because it is dominated by the most massive stars , the rate at which the uv luminosities decrease with time is given by the imf slope at higher masses . for this reason ,",
    "the uv colour of the integrated sed over the star formation history depends on the imf .",
