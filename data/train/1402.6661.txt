    "theoretical and observational consistencies demand that the standard model of universe be complemented by early phase of accelerated expansion , dubbed inflation @xcite , and late time cosmic acceleration @xcite .",
    "inflation is a remarkable paradigm , a single simple idea which addresses logical consistencies of hot big bang and provides a mechanism for primordial perturbations needed to seed the structures in the universe . as for late time cosmic acceleration ,",
    "it is now accepted as an observed phenomenon though its underlying cause still remains to be obscure , whereas similar confirmation of inflation is still awaited .",
    "thus , the hot big bang and the two phases of accelerated expansion is a theoretically accepted framework for the description of our universe .",
    "no doubt that inflation is a great idea , the phenomenon should therefore live for ever such that the late time cosmic acceleration is nothing but its reincarnation _  la _ quintessential inflation @xcite .",
    "the idea was first proposed by peebles and vilenkin in 1999 @xcite which was later implemented in the framework of braneworld cosmology @xcite . at the theoretical level , it sounds pretty simple to implement such a proposal in the language of a single scalar field .",
    "the field potential should be shallow at early times , facilitating slow roll , followed by steep behavior thereafter and turning shallow again at late times .",
    "the steep potential is needed for radiative regime to commence , such that the field is sub - dominant during radiation era and does not interfere with nucleosynthesis .",
    "it should continue to remain in hiding during matter phase , till its late phases , in order not to obstruct structure formation .",
    "it is then desirable to have scaling regime , in which the field mimics the background being invisible , allowing the dynamics to be free from initial conditions , which in turn require a particular steep behavior of the potential . at late times",
    "the field should overtake the background , giving rise to late - time cosmic acceleration , which is the case if slow roll is ensured or if the potential mimics shallow behavior effectively .",
    "there are several obstacles in implementing the above unification scheme .",
    "first , since inflation survives in this scenario until late times , the potential is typically of a run - away type and one therefore requires an alternative mechanism of reheating in this case .",
    "one could invoke reheating due to gravitational particle production after inflation @xcite , which is a universal phenomenon .",
    "however , the latter is an inefficient process and it might take very long for radiative regime to commence . clearly , in this case , the scalar field spends long time in the kinetic regime such that the field energy density redshifts with the scale factor as @xmath0 corresponding to equation of state of stiff matter .",
    "it is known that the amplitude of gravitational waves produced at the end of inflation enhances during kinetic regime , and if the latter is long , the relic gravitational waves @xcite might come into conflict with nucleosynthesis constraint at the commencement of radiative regime @xcite .",
    "hence , one should look yet for another alternative reheating mechanism , such as instant preheating @xcite , to circumvent the said problem .    a second obstacle to the unification is that if we want the scalar field to mimic the background for most of the thermal history , the field potential should behave like a steep exponential potential at least approximately such as the inverse power - law potentials .",
    "since scaling regime is an attractor in such cases , an exit mechanism from scaling regime to late time acceleration should be in place in the scenario .",
    "let us examine as how to build the unified picture .",
    "the single scalar field models aiming for quintessential inflation can be broadly put into two classes : ( 1 ) models in which the field potential has a required steep behavior for most of the history of universe but turn shallow at late times , for instance , the inverse power - law potentials @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) models in which the field potential is shallow at early epochs giving rise to inflation , followed by the required steep behavior .    in the first class of potentials ,",
    "we can not implement inflation in the standard framework , since slow roll needs to be assisted in this case . for example",
    ", one could invoke randall - sundrum ( rs ) braneworld @xcite corrections @xcite to facilitate inflation with steep potential at early epochs . in this case , as the field rolls down to low energy regime , the braneworld corrections disappear , giving rise to a graceful exit from inflation and thereafter the scalar field has the required behavior .",
    "however , gravitational particle production @xcite is extremely inefficient in the braneworld inflation @xcite and one could in principle introduce the instant preheating to tackle the relic gravitational waves problem @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the steep braneworld inflation is inconsistent with observations , namely , the tensor - to - scalar ratio of perturbations is too high in this case .",
    "thus , the scenario fails in the early phase , although the late - time evolution is compatible with theoretical consistency and observational requirements @xcite .    in the second class of potentials , that is shallow at early epochs followed by steep behavior , we need a mechanism to exit from scaling regime . a possible way out",
    "is provided by introducing neutrino matter , such that neutrino masses are field - dependent @xcite .",
    "such a scenario can be motivated from brans - dicke framework , with an additional assumption on the matter lagrangian in the jordan frame , namely treating massive neutrinos differently from other forms of matter in a way that the field is minimally coupled to cold dark matter / baryon matter in einstein frame whereas the neutrino masses grow with the field @xcite . in such a scenario neutrinos",
    "do not show up in radiation era ; their energy density tracks radiation being sub - dominant .",
    "however , in the subsequent matter phase at late times , as they become non - relativistic , their masses begin to grow and their direct coupling to scalar field builds up such that the effective potential acquires a minimum at late times giving rise to late time acceleration , provided the field rolls slowly around the effective minimum . at this point ,",
    "a question arises , namely whether we could do without neutrino matter and the extra assumption in which case the field would couple to matter directly in the einstein frame and the effective potential would also acquire a minimum . for simplicity",
    "let us assume that we are dealing with a constant coupling @xmath1 _  la _ coupled quintessence @xcite . in that case",
    "it is possible to achieve slow roll around the minimum of the effective potential , provided that @xmath1 is much larger than the slope of the potential , such that the effective equation - of - state parameter has a desired negative value ( @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the slope of the potential ) .",
    "the scaling solution ( which is accelerating thanks to non - minimal coupling ) , an attractor of the dynamics , is approached soon after the universe enters into matter - dominated regime and consequently we can not have a viable matter phase in this case .",
    "it is therefore necessary that the matter regime is left intact and the transition to accelerated expansion takes place only at late times .",
    "the latter can be triggered by massive neutrino matter with field - dependent masses @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider a scenario of quintessential inflation in the framework of variable gravity model @xcite .",
    "we first revisit the model in jordan frame ( sec .",

    "we summarize the results .",
    "in this section we revisit and analyze the variable gravity model@xcite to be used for our investigations .",
    "the scenario of variable gravity is characterized by the following action in the jordan - frame , : @xmath4 { \\nonumber}\\\\ & & + \\t \\s_m+\\t\\s_r+\\t\\s_\\nu \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where tildes represent the quantities in the jordan frame . in the above action @xmath5",
    "is the cosmon field with @xmath6 , and apart from the coupling @xmath7 we have considered an effective planck mass @xmath8 driven by the field . additionally , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the matter and radiation actions respectively and @xmath11 is the action for neutrino matter , which we have considered separately since massive neutrinos play an important role in this model during late times . during the radiation era or earlier ,",
    "neutrinos are ultra relativistic or relativistic , which implies that neutrinos behave as radiation during and before radiation era , with their mass being constant .",
    "after the radiation era neutrinos start losing their energy and become non - relativistic , behaving like ordinary matter with zero pressure . during late times",
    "neutrino mass starts growing with the field , and along with the cosmon field @xmath5 they give rise to late - time de sitter solution @xcite .    in this construction",
    "the variation in the particles masses comes from the non - minimal coupling of the field with matter . for",
    "radiation this non - minimal coupling does not affect its continuity equation , since the energy - momentum tensor for radiation is traceless .",
    "we consider different couplings of the field with matter , radiation , and neutrinos , that is we consider the non - minimal coupling @xmath12 between the cosmon field and matter , and the non - minimal coupling @xmath13 between the cosmon field and the neutrinos . without loss of generality",
    "we consider the non - minimal coupling between the field and radiation to be @xmath14 too . to sum up , we shall use the following actions , @xmath15    variation of the action ( [ eq : action_j ] ) with respect to the metric leads to the einstein field equation @xmath16 where @xmath17 includes the contributions from matter , radiation and neutrinos , that is @xmath18 .",
    "variation of action ( [ eq : action_j ] ) with respect to the cosmon field @xmath5 provides its equation of motion of the field , namely @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 here the primes represent derivatives with respect to @xmath5 and the energy - momentum tensors are defined as @xmath22 one can easily see that @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the masses of matter - particles and neutrino and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the number densities of the matter - particles and the neutrinos respectively . in the above expression we have followed @xcite and for convenience",
    "we have defined @xmath28 through @xmath29    comparing ( [ eq : q_chim1 ] ) and ( [ eq : q_chinu1 ] ) with ( [ eq : q_chim ] ) and ( [ eq : q_chinu ] ) respectively , we can see that @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "thus , choosing suitable @xmath32 and @xmath33 we can match our considerations with those of @xcite .",
    "in particular , according to @xcite particles masses vary linearly with the cosmon field , apart from the neutrinos . that is @xmath34 , which leads to @xmath35 .",
    "neutrino mass varies slightly differently than the other particles .",
    "in particular , @xmath36 , which gives @xmath37 , with @xmath28 a constant .    we shall consider four matter components in the universe , namely , radiation , baryonic+cold dark matter ( cdm ) , neutrinos and the contribution of the cosmon field .",
    "furthermore , we stress that the late - time dark energy is attributed to two contributions , namely to both the cosmon and the neutrino fields .",
    "thus , the total energy - momentum tensor , which can be calculated from action ( [ eq : action_j ] ) , reads @xmath38 where @xmath39 with @xmath40 the present value of @xmath41 . )",
    "is calculated by writing eq .",
    "( [ eq : eins_j ] ) as the standard one , that is @xmath42 where @xmath43 gives the present value of the newton s constant . ]",
    "the evolution equations of the various sectors in the model at hand read : @xmath44 which follow from the equations @xmath45    from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : matcont ] ) , ( [ eq : neutcont ] ) and ( [ eq : radcont ] ) we can extract the continuity equation for the cosmon field , which writes as @xmath46    finally , the consistency check of the eqs .",
    "( [ eq : matcont ] ) , ( [ eq : neutcont ] ) , ( [ eq : radcont ] ) and ( [ eq : decont ] ) follows from the conservation equation of the total energy @xmath47 : @xmath48    we close this section by mentioning that , although the above model looks similar to extended quintessence @xcite , or as a special case of the generalized galileon models , there is a crucial difference , namely that the particle masses depend on @xmath5 , that is the matter energy density and pressure depend on @xmath5 too .",
    "this has an important phenomenological consequence the appearance of an effective interaction between the scalar field and matter and neutrinos , described by relations ( [ eq : matcont ] ) , ( [ eq : neutcont ] ) and ( [ eq : decont ] ) . in the discussion to follow",
    ", it would be convenient to work in the einstein frame .",
    "in this section we examine the variable gravity model in the einstein frame and analyze the aspects related to early phase , thermal history and late time evolution .",
    "let us consider the following conformal transformation , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the conformal factor and @xmath51 is the einstein - frame metric .    using the conformal transformation ( [ eq : ct ] )",
    "one can easily show that @xmath52 therefore , under the conformal transformation ( [ eq : ct ] ) the jordan - frame action ( [ eq : action_j ] ) becomes @xmath53 + \\mathcal{s}_m+\\mathcal{s}_r+\\s_\\nu \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath54 \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in this work following @xcite , we consider the choice , @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath3 are constants ( the tilde in @xmath56 has nothing to do with the frame choice ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath57 is an intrinsic mass scale which plays a crucial role in inflation , when @xmath58 , but can be neglected during and after radiation era when @xmath5 grows to a higher value such that @xmath59 .",
    "hence , for the late time behavior of the model we can use the approximation @xmath59 , which gives approximately a constant @xmath60 : @xmath61    one can easily see that in the einstein frame , neutrino matter is non - minimally coupled to cosmon field whereas matter and radiation are minimally coupled .",
    "indeed , we have @xmath62 thus , from ( [ eq : sm ] ) , ( [ eq : sr ] ) and ( [ eq : snu ] ) we deduce that only the neutrino mass is field - dependent in the einstein frame , while the other particles masses remain constant as it should be @xcite , that is @xmath63    eqs .",
    "( [ eq : matcontef ] ) and ( [ eq : radcontef ] ) imply that @xmath64 and @xmath65 , as usual .",

    "let us make a comment here on the standard - quintessence limit of the scenario of variable gravity , which acts as a self - consistency test of our analysis .",
    "clearly , this is obtained when @xmath430 , @xmath431 and @xmath432 ( since @xmath432 the value of @xmath334 does not play a role ) , that is one freezes these variables to these values , in table [ tablecrit ] , and thus neglects about the four corresponding eigenvalues ( the system can not get perturbed in these directions ) . in this case , we do recover the standard - quintessence points of @xcite , and in particular @xmath408 becomes the physically interesting dark - energy - dominated , quintessence - like point , while @xmath414 becomes the stiff dark - energy one .",

    "in the present work we have investigated a scenario of variable gravity @xcite in context with quintessential inflation@xmath406 a unified description of cosmic evolution from inflation to radiation , matter and dark - energy epochs . in variable gravity the planck mass is driven by a scalar - field , which additionally drives the mass of the various particles .",
    "this field - depending mass , amongst others , leads to the appearance of an effective interaction between the scalar field and matter and neutrinos .",
    "furthermore , through suitable conformal transformations , one can formulate this model in the einstein frame in terms of a canonical scalar field with an effective non - minimal coupling between the canonical field and the neutrinos . the cold dark matter",
    "is minimally coupled in this framework .",
    "the key assumption in the model is related to the field dependence of masses in jordan frame such that cold dark matter and baryonic matter has standard behavior in einstein frame whereas the neutrino masses grow with field in a specific way . the canonical scalar field at early times",
    "is shown to drive inflation with required number of e - folds @xmath213 ( which is approximately equal to @xmath439 in the model under consideration ) and tensor to scalar ratio of perturbations , @xmath440 consistent with planck data within @xmath441 confidence level .",
    "after inflation , the field potential fast turns into a steep exponential potential such that the field enters into kinetic regime with field energy density redshifting as @xmath0 .",
    "we checked that gravitational particle production as a reheating mechanism is inefficient(@xmath442 ) and it takes long for the radiative regime to commence .",
    "the amplitude of relic gravity waves enhances during kinetic regime such that nucleosynthesis constraint(@xmath443 ) is violated at the beginning of radiation domination in this case .",
    "we then implemented instant preheating mechanism which involves the coupling of inflaton with a scalar field @xmath5 such that @xmath444 which in turn couples to matter field , @xmath445 . at the end of inflation ,",
    "the mass of @xmath5 changes non - adiabatically giving rise to @xmath5 production . assuming that the energy of @xmath5 production is thermalized",
    ", we can achieve @xmath446 provided that @xmath447 .",
    "since after inflation , @xmath71 grows fast , the produced particles are shown to decay fast into @xmath304 avoiding any back reaction of @xmath5 particles on the post inflationary dynamics of field @xmath71 provided that @xmath448 .",
    "we also noticed that particle production takes place almost instantaneously after the end of inflation(@xmath449 ) .",
    "we have shown that instant preheating takes place in a large parameter space ( g , h ) and the process is quite efficient to comply with the thermal history .",
    "since the field potential in post inflationary era mimics a steep exponential potential with chosen slope , the field exhibits the scaling behavior after the locking regime being sub - dominant . at late times",
    "when neutrinos become non - relativistic , the direct coupling of neutrino matter with scalar field builds up and thanks to non - minimal coupling , the field potential acquires minimum which slowly evolves with expansion of universe .",
    "the field settles in that minimum for ever ; the transition from scaling regime to late time cosmic acceleration is successfully triggered by growing neutrino matter . by performing a detailed phase - space analysis",
    ", we showed that apart from the usual stable attractors similar to those of standard quintessence , namely the de sitter , the dark - energy dominated quintessence - like , and the non - accelerating universe , stiff - dark ones , the system can result in a new attractor , with properties depending on the neutrino behavior , corresponding to a quintessence - like universe .",
    "we have shown that quintessential inflation based upon variable gravity model can successfully unify inflation and dark energy . the model based upon instant preheating",
    "is shown to be consistent with observations .",
    "the possibility of detection of the relic gravity wave background by advanced ligo and lisa are discussed .    as for early universe ,",
    "the model complies with the recent planck data , showing that within @xmath441 confidence level , the scenario is consistent with observations .",
    "the scrutiny of late time acceleration and the study of observational constraints on the model parameters is deferred to our future work .",
    "it will also be interesting to carry out detailed investigations of stability of neutrino matter under perturbations .",
    "one may also examine the scenario under consideration in the framework of warm inflation which might further improve the tensor to scalar ratio of perturbations .",
