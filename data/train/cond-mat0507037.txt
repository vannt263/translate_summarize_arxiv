    "understanding the behavior of networks of dynamical units is a very important subject of research in various contexts such as information processing in the brain , or metabolic systems . given the richness of the observed phenomenology and the relevance of many different ingredients ( e.g. , the topology of the connections , the presence of disorder and of delayed interactions ) , it is very instructive to consider even simple setups in the perspective of identifying the hopefully few mechanisms responsible for the main general phenomena . here",
    ", we focus our attention on a type of collective behavior arising in globally coupled identical systems .",
    "the first evidence of collective behavior dates back to the 70 s , when it was proven that a nonzero mean field may spontaneously arise in an ensemble of particles stochastically moving in a bistable potential @xcite .",
    "later , it was numerically shown that macroscopic periodic dynamics appears in coupled stochastic @xcite as well as chaotic ( rssler ) oscillators @xcite , while the first experimental evidence was found in josephson ",
    "junction arrays @xcite .",
    "collective behaviour may also arise in the presence of quenched disorder as revealed by the kuramoto model  @xcite , introduced to explain the onset of synchronization in an ensemble of different units  @xcite . over the years",
    "it has been discovered that collective dynamics can be also chaotic , as found in globally coupled maps @xcite and oscillators @xcite .",
    "here we investigate `` partial synchronization '' ( ps ) , a little known phenomenon discovered in pulse  coupled , leaky integrate - and - fire ( lif ) neurons @xcite . in this regime ,",
    "the mean field exhibits a periodic dynamics which , at variance with other contexts , arises in the absence of any synchronization between the single units which behave quasi - periodically .",
    "ps arises from the destabilization of a regime characterized by a constant mean field and a periodic behaviour of the single elements , their phases being equispaced .",
    "this  homogeneous regime \" has been found in many different contexts such as josephson devices @xcite , multi - mode lasers @xcite and electronic circuits  @xcite . by following ref .",
    "@xcite , it is now called `` splay state '' and its microscopic stability properties have been studied quite in detail in  @xcite . since splay states are rather general , it is reasonable to expect that the transition to ps can be observed in a wide class of systems too .",
    "in fact , the preliminary evidence of ps found in hindmarsh - rose neurons and van der pol oscillators @xcite confirms such expectations and poses the question of understanding the general conditions for the onset of ps .    in order to unravel this point",
    ", we develop a new formalism that allows treating pulse coupled oscillators and establishes a possible basis for an extension to different coupling schemes .",
    "the approach is introduced in a general framework to show the potentiality of the method , but the resulting delayed equations are analyzed only in the specific case of lif neurons , since in this case a simple and explicit expression is available for one of the relevant variables : the  finite - time \" lyapunov exponent @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , in the attempt of identifying the minimal model able to describe the onset of ps , we have explored both analytically and numerically the weak coupling limit , showing that a perturbative expansion allows reducing the delayed to ordinary equations .",
    "the persistence of the transition to ps for an arbitrarily small coupling strength paves the way towards more general setups . a further promising indication is given by the numerical observation that ps arises also for continuous force fields , which again suggests that the phenomenon is more general than initially conjectured @xcite .",
    "finally , we have added noise to the single neuron dynamics , finding that the macroscopic oscillations persist , though with a smaller amplitude .",
    "the investigation of globally coupled systems requires setting up a suitable ( nonlinear ) self - consistent approach . a much used approach to describe the collective behaviour of neural networks is dynamical mean field @xcite . here , in the absence of noise and of microscopic chaos",
    ", there is no justification a priori for coarse - graining and indeed the transition to ps can be observed already in ensembles of finitely many oscillators @xcite and can thus also be viewed as a bifurcation .",
    "it is therefore desirable to develop a formalism to capture both micro- and macro - scopic features .",
    "we start from the crossing - times as they are the most suitable variables to characterize splay states .",
    "our approach can , in fact , be viewed as an extension of the method followed in ref.@xcite , where pseudo - crossing times have been introduced with reference to the steady dynamics . on the other hand ,",
    "it is fair to recognize that the final model equations are equivalent to those obtained by implementing a dynamical mean field approach , when the latter is applicable .",
    "this implies that in the present context one can smoothly go from the microscopic to the macroscopic level .",
    "we consider an ensemble of @xmath1 phase oscillators ( i.e. rotators ) , each one characterized by the phase @xmath2 , @xmath3 which evolves according to the equation @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a suitable mean field whose dynamics depends homogeneously on all the @xmath2 in a way that is not crucial for the present discussion .",
    "the force field @xmath6 is assumed to be positive and periodic in @xmath7 with period 1 , but it can be discontinuous as , e.g. , a sawtooth function ( this is indeed the case considered in the next section ) .",
    "we start defining a suitable poincar section , by introducing a threshold @xmath8 , which , without loss of generality , is set in @xmath9 .",
    "let then @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote , respectively , the @xmath12th crossing time ( @xmath13 ) of the threshold and the corresponding rotator crossing the threshold .",
    "once the labels @xmath14 are ordered in such a way that @xmath15 , it follows that @xmath16 ) , phases can not cross each other , since two oscillators with the same phase must have also the same velocity . therefore , the threshold is always crossed in the same order . ] @xmath17 , the same oscillator crosses the threshold at time @xmath10 and @xmath18 .",
    "the core of the approach consists in deriving an equation linking @xmath19 with @xmath20 in the limit of large @xmath1 .",
    "simple arguments show that , up to higher - order corrections in @xmath21 , @xmath22 where @xmath23 ( here @xmath24 is meant modulo @xmath1 ) , while @xmath25 is the interval between two consecutive threshold crossings of the same oscillator ; finally , @xmath26 is the finite - time lyapunov exponent for a trajectory starting at time @xmath27 in @xmath28 and ending at time @xmath10 in @xmath9 , and thus , in general , depends on the dynamics of the field @xmath5 .",
    "the first and last equalities in the above equation state simply that the temporal separation is equal to the phase separation divided by the instantaneous velocity .",
    "the middle equality follows from the observation that , being @xmath29 a small quantity , it evolves according to the linearized dynamics . in view of the possible existence of a discontinuity in the force field",
    ", we carefully distinguish between the @xmath7 value just before ( @xmath9 ) and after @xmath30 ) the threshold crossing .",
    "if the crossing - time distribution is smooth ( this assumption can be verified a posteriori by integrating the resulting model ) , then @xmath31 has to be of the order of @xmath21 and one can accordingly introduce the  instantaneous \" flux @xmath32 where we have dropped the subscript @xmath12 in the l.h.s . as in the limit @xmath33 ,",
    "the time variable becomes again continuous .",
    "accordingly , eq .  ( [ core ] ) simplifies to @xmath34 where the time interval @xmath35 is self - consistently determined from the integral expression @xmath36 expressing the condition that from time @xmath37 to time @xmath38 , all oscillators cross the threshold .",
    "an equivalent and more appealing equation is obtained by evaluating the time derivative of eq .",
    "( [ eq : int_pi ] ) , namely @xmath39 in order to complete the derivation of a closed set of equations , it is necessary to include the mean field dynamics .",
    "in the context of pulse coupled systems , this can be easily done , since @xmath5 is , by definition , the linear superposition of the pulses emitted by the single oscillators whenever they reach a threshold that , without loss of generality , can be assumed to coincide with @xmath8 .",
    "accordingly , the mean field satisfies a linear differential equation of the type @xmath40 where the firing rate @xmath41 is nothing but the previously introduced instantaneous flux , while the structure of the operator @xmath42 can be determined by imposing that the corresponding green function coincides with the assumed shape of the emitted pulses .",
    "this completes the derivation of the final equations that are given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : model1],[eq : model2],[eq : model3 ] ) .",
    "the model combines properties of discrete ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : model1 ] ) ) and continuous ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq : model2],[eq : model3 ] ) ) time systems , besides involving a time - dependent self - adjusting delay . except for the first property",
    ", its structure resembles that of threshold delay equations @xcite introduced , e.g. , in epidemiology and immunology ( see @xcite for a similar model ) .",
    "in this section we specifically refer to the ensemble of lif neurons studied already in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this case",
    ", @xmath7 corresponds to the ( adimensional ) membrane potential which evolves according to the force field @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the coupling constant , while @xmath45 and @xmath46 determine the dependence of the force field on the potential @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath7 reaches the threshold @xmath47 at time @xmath48 , a pulse @xmath49 is emitted ( and received by all neurons ) , while the potential is reset to 0 .",
    "the resetting makes it legitimate to interpret @xmath7 as a phase variable , since one can formally extend @xmath7 to the whole real axis by identifying @xmath7 with @xmath50 and thereby see the evolution as a continuous process .",
    "paying attention to the discontinuities present in the force field , eq .",
    "( [ eq : model1 ] ) writes as @xmath51 where we have also taken into account that , because of the linearity of the force field , the _ lyapunov exponent _ @xmath0 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : model1 ] ) is equal to @xmath52 independently of the @xmath5 dynamics .",
    "as for the mean field , if we assume that the single pulse shape is @xmath53 , one finds that @xmath5 satisfies the equation @xcite @xmath54    as a result , the model reduces to the set of equations ( [ eq : model2],[eq : model1a],[eq : model3a ] ) . for a small enough @xmath55 value ,",
    "the dynamics converges to a fixed point . since all neurons",
    "sequentially cross the firing threshold , the translational invariance of a fixed point automatically implies a uniform distribution of the phase differences , that is the distinguishing feature of splay states .",
    "a tedious but strightforward linear stability analysis proves that the splay state destabilizes at the critical value already identified in @xcite , where a hopf bifurcation signals theonset of a collective periodic behaviour , i.e. of ps .",

    "the dots in panel ( a ) correspond to simulations performed in the presence of additive uniformly distributed noise of width @xmath62 ( the wider band corresponds to @xmath63 , while the other to @xmath64 ) . finally , a geometric procedure for reconstructing the single neuron firing times is plotted in ( b).,title=\"fig:\",width=226,height=5 ]   oscillators ( crosses ) and the set of equations ( [ eq : model2],[eq : model1a],[eq : model3a ] ) ( solid line ) for @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 . the representation in the phase space @xmath60",

    "[ fig : et ] we present the outcome of numerical simulations carried on in the ps regime .",
    "first of all , notice that the results are basically indistinguishable from those of the original set of equations , as they should .",
    "it is then instructive to look at @xmath65 , since it provides a bridge with the microscopic description .",
    "in fact , if we denote with @xmath66 $ ] the time when the @xmath14th neuron emits a spike ( i.e. , it crosses the threshold @xmath8 ) , @xmath67)$ ] represents the last inter - spike interval ( isi ) of the very same neuron and all past spike times are obtained by simply iterating the recursive formula @xmath68 = t_n[i]- t(t_n[i ] ) .",
    "\\label{eq : rotor}\\ ] ] geometrically , the implemetation of this formula corresponds to the following procedure ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : et]b ) : given the point @xmath69 , move down along a straight line of slope @xmath70 until the @xmath38-axis is reached at the time @xmath71 and then vertically up until the @xmath35-curve is hit . considering that @xmath65 is a positive definite periodic function , eq .",
    "( [ eq : rotor ] ) describes nothing but the evolution equation of a periodically forced oscillator , so that one expects the onset of locking phenomena .",
    "however , it appears that the self - generated @xmath35 dynamics does not exhibit any such locking , even when the ratio of the two frequencies is rational .",
    "this remarkable feature remains unexplained .",
    "another peculiarity of ps is that the single ",
    "neuron isi differs from ( it is always smaller than ) the period of the macroscopic dynamics . interestingly enough , this is the distinguishing feature of slowly oscillating periodic solutions already found in equations with state - dependent delay @xcite . qualitatively , the phenomenon can be clarified by noticing that neurons tend to bunch together , but , at the same time , those neurons lying in the front of the cluster escape away , while those reaching the back get stuck .",
    "this justifies the name `` partial synchronization '' attributed to this phenomenon .",
    "upon exploring the parameter plane @xmath72 , we have discovered that ps can be observed for arbitrarily small @xmath46-values . as a result",
    ", one can hope to shed further light on this phenomenon , by developing a perturbative analysis .",
    "this is not easy , because the limit case @xmath73 is degenerate , as eq .",
    "( [ eq : model1a ] ) is satisfied by any periodic function @xmath41 .",
    "in fact , in this limit , there are no effective interactions among the oscillators and their distribution does not change in time , whatever the initial choice is .",
    "the only constraints are given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : model3a ] ) , which allows determining @xmath74 and eq .",
    "( [ eq : int_pi ] ) , which fixes the period @xmath75 . thus , exactly for @xmath76 , ps can not arise , since the periodicity of the single oscillators necessarily coincides with the collective periodicity .",
    "however , as soon as @xmath77 , @xmath35 can differ from the period @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",
    "accordingly , for a generic function @xmath80 periodic of period @xmath78 , one can write @xmath81 by introducing this expansion into the model equations ( [ eq : model1a],[eq : model3a ] ) , one obtains , up to first order in @xmath46 , @xmath82 the same procedure , when applied to eq .",
    "( [ eq : model2 ] ) , implies that @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is a constant of motion , so that the model reduces to a simple set of ordinary differential equations in a three dimensional space ( @xmath5 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 being the relevant variables ) .",
    "the a priori unknown parameter @xmath84 must be determined self - consistently by imposing that the integral of @xmath87 over the period @xmath78 is equal to @xmath70 . by numerically integrating the above set of equations",
    ", we find a self - consistent solution above a suitable critical @xmath55-value .",
    "the corresponding collective behaviour is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltae ] for different @xmath55-values .",
    "and @xmath86 decreases as one approaches @xmath88 ( the critical point for @xmath89 and @xmath57 ) .",
    "the transition is thus a supercritical hopf bifurcation.,width=7 ]",
    "in order to test the robustness of the ps regime , we have performed some further studies both to verify whether the discontinuity in the force field is a necessary condition and to explore the stability against the addition of external noise .",
    "the simplest way to introduce a continuous force field is by adding a branch @xmath90 ( with @xmath91 ) to eq .",
    "( [ eq : model3b ] ) which is now restricted to @xmath92 .",
    "it is in principle possible to follow the same approach that has led to eq .",
    "( [ eq : model1a ] ) , but here we limit ourselves to mentioning the result of our numerical simulations , namely that for @xmath93 , the continuous model keeps exhibiting a transition to ps .",
    "finally , we have numerically analysed the original model , under the further action of a zero - average uniformly distributed noise of width @xmath62 for @xmath63 and @xmath94 .",
    "the results , plotted in fig .  [ fig : et ] , show that the collective behaviour , though depressed by the noise action , persists .",
    "in fact , the transversal fuzziness appears to decrease with the number @xmath1 of oscillators as @xmath95 .    in the second section",
    "we have obtained a closed set of equations to treat identical pulse - coupled rotators .",
    "the main obstacle towards specific applications is the need to express the finite - time lyapunov exponent in eq .",
    "( [ eq : model1 ] ) in terms of the other relevant variables .",
    "this seems to be only a technical problem , that we have indeed recently solved for generic sinusoidal fields @xcite . on the other hand",

    ", a close comparison with the dynamical mean field approach should be very helpful , since noise can be easily handled by the latter one , while our method is more open to the treatment of generic force fields .",
