    "the percolation problem has for many years been of great interest to theoretical physicists and mathematicians , in part because it is so simply stated yet so full of fascinating results .",
    "it embodies many of the important concepts of critical phenomena , yet is purely geometrical in nature .",
    "percolation studies the clustering properties of identical objects which are randomly and uniformly distributed through space . in lattice _ bond _",
    "percolation , the links of a regular lattice , of edge length @xmath1 , are either _ open _ or _ closed__. in the simplest version of the model , the open bonds are independently distributed with a probability @xmath2 for each to be open ( and @xmath3 to be closed . ) in _ site _ percolation , the bonds are all assumed to be open , but now each site is open with probability @xmath2 . in both cases",
    "we study the statistical properties of _ clusters _ of neighbouring open bonds and sites . when @xmath2 is small , the mean cluster size is also small , but , in more than one dimension , there is a critical value @xmath4 of @xmath2 , called the percolation threshold , at which the mean cluster size diverges .",
    "for @xmath5 there is a finite probability that a given site belongs to an infinitely large cluster . which are distributed independently so that they may overlap . in all cases , however",
    ", a finite microscopic length @xmath1 is necessary to define the notion of clustering . ] _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    in these lectures , we shall be concerned with properties of the _ continuum limit _ of percolation .",
    "this may be defined as follows ( we consider two dimensions from now on ) : consider a finite region @xmath6 of the plane , bounded by a curve @xmath7 .",
    "consider a percolation problem on a sequence of lattices @xmath8 covering @xmath6 , constructed in such a way that the lattice spacing @xmath9 keeping the size of @xmath6 fixed . obviously when we do this , such quantities as the total number of clusters in @xmath6 will diverge as @xmath9 , so we need to identify some suitable quantities which might have a finite limit .",
    "an example is afforded by the _ crossing probabilities__.",
    "suppose for simplicity that @xmath6 is simply connected , and let @xmath10 and @xmath11 be two disjoint segments of @xmath7 ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] )",
    ". then a _ crossing event _ is a configuration of bonds ( or sites ) on the lattice @xmath12 such that there exists at least one cluster , wholly contained within @xmath6 , containing both at least one point of @xmath10 and of @xmath11 .",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _    let @xmath13 be the probability of this event .",
    "then the following statements are all conjectured to be true :    * @xmath13 has a finite limit , denoted by @xmath14 , as @xmath9 , which ( under a broad class of conditions ) is independent of the particular form of @xmath15 , of the precise way in which @xmath15 intersects the boundary @xmath7 , and of whether the microscopic model is formulated as bond , site , or any other type of percolation , as long as there are only short - range correlations in the probability measure .. for @xmath16 , @xmath17 , because all clusters are finite ( in units of @xmath1 ) , while for @xmath5 the infinite cluster always spans , so the limit is 1 .",
    "] * @xmath14 is invariant under transformations of @xmath18 which are conformal in its interior ( but not necessarily on its boundary @xmath7 ) . *",
    "the riemann mapping theorem allows us to conformally map the interior of @xmath6 onto the interior of the unit disc @xmath19 of the complex plane .",
    "suppose that the ends of the segments are thereby mapped into the points @xmath20 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for the labelling ) . then @xmath14 is a function only of their cross - ratio @xmath21 and has the explicit form @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the hypergeometric function .",
    "* moreover , if the random variable @xmath24 denotes the total number of distinct clusters which cross from @xmath10 to @xmath11 , then the whole probability distribution of @xmath25 also has a finite limit as @xmath9 and is conformally invariant , depending only on @xmath26 .",
    "in particular the mean number of such crossing clusters is @xmath27=\\ffrac12-\\ffrac{\\sqrt3}{4\\pi } \\left[\\ln(1-\\eta ) + 2\\sum_{m=1}^\\infty{\\gamma(\\ffrac13+m)\\gamma(\\ffrac23 ) \\over\\gamma(\\ffrac23+m)\\gamma(\\ffrac13)}{(1-\\eta)^m\\over m}\\right]\\ ] ]    equations ( [ crossing],[meannumber ] ) are just two among many similar results which may been obtained using methods of conformal field theory developed by theoretical physicists@xcite . at first sight",
    ", the appearance of formulas like these may seem quite mysterious to those used to thinking about percolation as a lattice problem .",
    "it is certainly true that the methods originally used to derive them are not , so far , mathematically rigorous . ) using other methods . ]",
    "but there is no doubt that they are correct - ( [ crossing ] ) has been numerically tested to great precision in a number of cases@xcite , and , moreover , once the existence of a conformally invariant continuum limit is accepted , the formulas follow from very classical mathematical methods . it is the purpose of these lectures to give some idea to a non - specialist audience of how these kinds of results arise",
    "inevitably i shall not be able to cover all the details , but hopefully the lectures will provide a basis from which to explore the literature further@xcite . for reasons of time i will focus on the derivation of the above formulae , which is mostly my own work , as well as mention some other recent alternative derivations .",
    "this is not to overlook the work of others on other important results in percolation , particularly that of nienhuis , duplantier , saleur and others on the coulomb gas approach , which is better suited to systems without boundaries .",
    "the emphasis in this course will be on the analogy between percolation and conventional critical behaviour in spin systems .",
    "this is through a well - known mapping first discovered by fortuin and kastelyn@xcite .",
    "the potts model is a generalisation of the ising model in which the spins @xmath28 at each site of a lattice take the values @xmath29 , where , initially , @xmath30 is an integer larger than 1 .",
    "the energy is the sum over all nearest neighbour pairs @xmath31 of sites ( i.e. a sum over all bonds ) of @xmath32 .",
    "thus the partition function is @xmath33 apart from an overall unimportant constant this may be rewritten as @xmath34 where @xmath35 .",
    "now imagine expanding out the product .",
    "if there are @xmath36 bonds on the lattice there will be @xmath37 terms in this expansion . each term may be associated with a configuration in which each bond of the lattice is open ( if we choose the term @xmath38 ) , or closed ( if we choose the term @xmath39 ) .",
    "sites connected by open bonds form clusters , and the kronecker deltas force the all the spins in a given cluster to be in the same state .",
    "when we trace over the spins , each cluster will have only one free spin , so will give a factor @xmath30 .",
    "thus we can write @xmath40 as a sum over configurations @xmath41 of open bonds : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the number of distinct clusters in @xmath41 .",
    "note that in this form , at least for a finite lattice , @xmath40 is a polynomial in @xmath30 and therefore its definition may be extended to non - integer values of @xmath30 .    the weights in ( [ rcm ] )",
    "define the _ random cluster model__. of course , in percolation , each cluster is weighted with a factor 1 , so it corresponds to @xmath44 . in that case , the sum is simply over all possible configurations weighted by their probabilities , so @xmath45 . however , there is nontrivial information in the correlation functions .",
    "for example , the probability that sites @xmath46 and @xmath47 are in the same cluster is given by the limit as @xmath48 of @xmath49 where @xmath1 and @xmath50 are any two different potts states . from ( [ rcm ] ) we can also calculate quantities like the mean total number of clusters by differentiating with respect to @xmath30 : @xmath51=(\\partial/\\partial q)|_{q=1}\\,z(q)\\ ] ] _ _ _    it is important establish how quantities like the crossing probabilities may be related to those in the potts model . for this",
    "we need to bring in the notion of boundary conditions .",
    "consider a potts model defined on a lattice @xmath15 which covers the region @xmath6 of the plane , as described in the introduction .",
    "we consider the boundary of @xmath15 as being the set of sites which lie just outside @xmath6 but are adjacent to sites within @xmath6 .",
    "these boundary sites form a discrete approximation to the boundary @xmath7 . on these boundary sites , there are two simple and natural boundary conditions we might impose on the potts spins : _ free _ _ , which means that we sum freely over them in the partition function ; and _ fixed _ _ , in which case they are all fixed into some particular potts state , say @xmath1 . _ _ _ _ _ _    notice that if we take the same boundary condition on the whole boundary , then in the limit @xmath48 partition functions with either free or fixed boundary conditions become the same , @xmath52 , since all spins must be in the same state ! but we can get something nontrivial if we allow the boundary conditions to be different on different parts of the boundary . in particular , consider the geometry of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , and suppose the boundary spins are fixed on the segments @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and free on the rest of the boundary . by the permutation symmetry of the potts states ,",
    "there are two possible different cases : when the fixed states on @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the same , for example @xmath1 ; or when they are different , say @xmath1 and @xmath50 .",
    "let us denote the partition functions in the two cases by @xmath53 and @xmath54 respectively .",
    "now each configuration @xmath41 either has , or does not have , a cluster which spans between @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "those which do not have a spanning cluster contribute to both partition functions ( with the appropriate weights ) , but configurations which do can not contribute to @xmath54 , since the existence of the cluster would force spins on the two segments to be in the same state , which is not true by assumption .",
    "thus we have a simple relation for the crossing probability , on the lattice : is not given by the ( normalised ) difference @xmath55 , since this counts clusters which touch @xmath10 and/or @xmath11 with weight 1 , rather than @xmath30 . ]",
    "@xmath56 remember that each of these is a polynomial in @xmath30 , so that @xmath57 makes perfect sense at @xmath44 , even though it might seem that we need at least two states to define it .",
    ", where @xmath25 is the number of crossing clusters .",
    "it is also possible to design more complicated boundary conditions which give @xmath58 for any integer @xmath59 .",
    "see @xcite . ]    with only slightly more effort we can relate the mean number of distinct crossing clusters @xmath60 $ ] to partition functions . consider once again the geometry of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , but now subdivide the clusters into those which touch neither @xmath10 nor @xmath11 , those which touch @xmath10 but not @xmath11 , those which touch @xmath11 but not @xmath10 , and finally the crossing clusters , which touch both @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "denote the number of each such cluster in each configuration by @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath25 respectively ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . )    since clusters which touch a boundary where the potts spins are fixed are counted with weight 1 , while those which are free are counted with weight @xmath30 , it follows that @xmath64 where @xmath65 now denotes that the boundary spins are free on that portion of the boundary ( they are always free on the complement of @xmath66 .",
    ") then straightforward algebra shows that @xmath67 where the last equality holds because all the partition functions equal 1 at @xmath44 .",
    "it will be the aim in the rest of these lectures to derive explicit expressions for these partition functions , in the continuum limit , and for @xmath30 close to 1 .",
    "the potts model in two dimensions is known to have a critical point , with a divergent correlation length , for @xmath68 .",
    "we now move onto less solid ground .",
    "what i am now going to assert is based on evidence from the exactly solved ising model @xmath69 , as well as the analysis of renormalised perturbation theory near the upper critical dimension.@xcite    at the critical point , these theories are believed to be _",
    "scale invariant__. what this means for correlation functions is the following .",
    "consider for example , the correlations @xmath70 of the local lattice magnetisation in the ising model .",
    "since @xmath71 , this quantity has no dimensions . at the critical point , in the limit where the lattice spacing @xmath9 with the points @xmath72 kept fixed",
    ", it behaves like @xmath73 times a function of @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is a pure number ( equal to @xmath76 for the ising model magnetisation . )",
    "this means that we can define a _ scaling operator _",
    "@xmath77 such that the limit @xmath9 of the correlation functions @xmath78 exists .",
    "the pure number @xmath75 , which we should denote as @xmath79 , is called the _ scaling dimension _ of @xmath80 . _ _ _ _ _ _ _    moreover , as long as the original lattice model has sufficient symmetry under finite rotations , the limit is invariant under infinitesimal rotations .",
    "thus , far away from any boundaries , the two - point correlation function @xmath81 depends on the separation @xmath82 only , and , on dimensional grounds , must therefore have the form is conventionally denoted by @xmath83 . ]",
    "@xmath84    the above statement is strictly true only when the points @xmath72 are distinct , in the limit @xmath9 .",
    "that is , they are separated by an infinite number of lattice spacings .",
    "when their relative distances are kept fixed in units of @xmath1 , other scaling operators may arise .",
    "for example , the product @xmath85 on neighbouring sites may be thought of as being proportional to the local energy density in the ising model .",
    "correlation functions of this quantity behave in a similar way to those of the magnetisation , but they define a different scaling operator , with a different scaling dimension . in general",
    "there is an infinite number of scaling operators @xmath86 , each with their own scaling dimensions @xmath87 .",
    "arbitrary local products @xmath88 of spins which are separated by distances @xmath89 , are given asymptotically as linear combinations of these scaling operators : @xmath90 where the dimensionless coefficients @xmath91 are of order unity , and correlations of the scaling operators all have a limit as @xmath9 .",
    "these are rotationally and translationally invariant ( far from a boundary ) , and also _ scale covariant _ _ : under a scale transformation @xmath92 @xmath93 in ( [ s ] ) the coefficients depend on the particular lattice and so on , but the scaling dimensions @xmath79 are _",
    "universal__. for example , in the potts model they depend only on @xmath30 and the dimensionality of the system , assuming that the interactions are short - ranged . to be much smaller than the distances @xmath94 to the other points with @xmath95",
    ", this correlation function may be expressed as a sum over correlation functions with only a single operator at the mid - point , say , of @xmath46 and @xmath47 : @xmath96 where the dependence on @xmath97 is dictated by scale covariance and rotational invariance ( we have assumed that all the operators are scalar under rotations , which is a slight over - simplification ) .",
    "the important thing is that the coefficients @xmath98 are also universal , and in particular independent of the other operators hidden in the @xmath99 .",
    "we can thus remove the @xmath100 .",
    "the result is called the _ operator product expansion ( ope)_. _ _ ] _ _ _ _ _ _      the above statements about the existence of the continuum limit remain valid in the presence of boundaries .",
    "of course the boundary now breaks global rotational and translational invariance . taking for simplicity the boundary to run along the real axis ,",

    "is equivalent to the _ bulk - boundary _ expansion @xmath114 . _",
    "_ ] it turns out that the set of such operators depends not only on the bulk universality class , but also on the nature of the boundary condition , for example whether the lattice spins are free or fixed . _ _ _      once the idea of boundary scaling operators was understood , it was realised@xcite that , at least in two dimensions when the boundary is one - dimensional , there is another set of objects which should possess similar properties under scale transformations .",
    "these are points on the boundary where the boundary condition changes from one type to another .",
    "let us illustrate this with a relevant example from the potts model .",
    "consider a potts model in the half - disc @xmath115 , @xmath116 , see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .",
    "compare the case when ( a ) the boundary conditions on the potts spins are free ( @xmath65 ) at every point of the boundary except for the interval @xmath117 of the real axis , where they are fixed to state @xmath1 , to the case ( b ) when they are free everywhere on the boundary .",
    "denote the corresponding partition functions by @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "then the ratio @xmath120 has a finite limit as @xmath121 , which therefore depends only on @xmath122 .",
    "we may think of this ratio as defining the two - point correlation function of _ boundary condition changing operators _ ( bcc operators ) with a well - defined scaling dimension : @xmath123 within the potts model , we expect the scaling dimension of this bcc operator to be universal , depending only on @xmath30 .",
    "more complicated sets of boundary conditions may be considered .",
    "for example , the partition function @xmath57 in ( [ zz ] ) which we shall need to compute the crossing probability is related to the correlation function @xmath124 .",
    "_ _      consider now a lattice model defined on an infinitely long strip of width @xmath125 , parametrised by the coordinates @xmath126 with @xmath127",
    ". we could consider periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath128-direction , but for our purposes it will be more useful to think about particular boundary conditions , labelled say by @xmath129 and @xmath130 ( which do not have to be the same ) on either edge of the strip .",
    "a convenient way of discussing this geometry is through the transfer matrix .",
    "note that the scaling ` operators ' introduced earlier are not true operators , but simply local densities , which commute with each other . ] @xmath131 , which is a finite matrix whose rows and columns are labelled respectively by the states of the spins in neighbouring rows @xmath132 , and whose elements are the boltzmann weights for the two rows .",
    "if we take the strip to have finite length @xmath133 in the @xmath134-direction , with periodic boundary conditions in that direction , the partition function is given by @xmath135 where the @xmath136 are a complete set of eigenvalues of @xmath137 ( which of course depend on @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath125 . ) in this picture the lattice spins @xmath138 themselves become matrices @xmath139 ( diagonal in this basis ) , acting on the same space as does @xmath137 . if the eigenstate corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of @xmath137 is denoted by @xmath140 , then a two - point correlation function may be written @xmath141 and so , by inserting a complete set of eigenstates of @xmath137 , we see that it decays along the strip as a sum of terms of the form @xmath142 such that @xmath143 .",
    "similar equations hold for the correlation function of any local product @xmath144 of lattice spins .",
    "how do these quantities behave in the continuum limit @xmath9 , with @xmath125 fixed ?",
    "the space of states becomes infinite - dimensional , but we shall not worry too much about its precise structure .",
    "the scaling ` operators ' @xmath145 become true local operators @xmath146 acting on this space .",
    "it is useful to write the transfer matrix itself as @xmath147 where @xmath148 has eigenvalues @xmath149 , so that correlation functions decay as a sum of terms @xmath150 .",
    "the existence of the continuum limit implies that the gaps @xmath151 have a limit as @xmath9 .",
    "scaling then implies that , at the critical point , each of these gaps must be proportional to @xmath152 .",
    "as we shall soon see , conformal invariance relates the constants of proportionality to scaling dimensions of operators .",
    "let us recall the equation ( [ scalecov ] ) for the behaviour of a general correlation function under a scale transformation @xmath92 : @xmath153 one way to understand this equation is from the existence of the continuum limit @xmath9 , and the absence of any other length scale at the critical point : if this limit does exist , it should not matter whether we rescale the lattice spacing in the underlying lattice model by a factor @xmath50 : @xmath154 , in the sense that the measure of those degrees of freedom which survive the continuum limit should be unchanged .",
    "but we can think of this rescaling ( which is a kind of renormalisation group transformation ) as keeping the lattice spacing fixed , and rescaling @xmath92 .",
    "now we make the following bold generalisation : since the measure is ultimately a product over local boltzmann weights , we may equally well make a rescaling @xmath155 where the factor @xmath50 now varies smoothly with @xmath156 ( on a scale @xmath157 . )",
    "so we generalise ( [ scalecov2 ] ) to @xmath158 where @xmath159 , the jacobian of the transformation .    what are the allowed transformations @xmath160 ?",
    "locally , they must correspond to a mixture of a scale transformation together with a possible rotation and translation .",
    "such transformations are called _",
    "conformal__. an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ conffig ] .",
    "so ( [ confcov ] ) describes the _ conformal covariance _ of an arbitrary correlation function . )",
    "can not be true for all scaling operators : for example it is easy to show that if it is true for @xmath80 it can not in general be true for @xmath161 .",
    "however , this analysis shows that it is true for a subset of operators called _ primary _ _ , and the transformation laws for all other operators may be derived from these . _ _ _ ] _ _ _ _ _    = 3.5 in    once again , it is not rigorously founded , but rather abstracted from exactly solved cases like the ising model , and from the structure of renormalised perturbation theory .",
    "it is generally believed that the continuum limit of any model which is invariant under scale transformations , rotations and translations , and has short - ranged interactions , is also conformally invariant .",
    "we are going to assume that it is valid for the continuum limit of the critical potts model with @xmath68 .    in two dimensions ,",
    "conformal invariance is particularly powerful , because if we label the points of the plane by a complex number @xmath162 , any analytic function @xmath163 defines a conformal transformation , at least at points where @xmath164 .",
    "let us consider for definiteness correlations of boundary operators , since it is these we need for our problem .",
    "they may be ordinary limits of bulk operators at the boundary , or they may be bcc operators . just as scale covariance fixes the form of the two - point functions , conformal invariance gives further information about the higher - point functions .",
    "if we consider the upper half plane , then the set of conformal transformations which preserve this are the real mbius transformations @xmath165 where @xmath1 , @xmath50 , @xmath166 and @xmath167 are real ( this is to preserve the real axis . ) given a 4-point function @xmath168 , with the @xmath169 real , it is therefore possible in general to choose the parameters in ( [ mob ] ) such that @xmath170 , @xmath171 and @xmath172 are mapped into three pre - assigned points , say , @xmath173 , corresponding to @xmath174 .",
    "however there is always an invariant of such a transformation : it is the cross - ratio ( anharmonic ratio ) @xmath175 ( where the notation @xmath176 has been introduced ) so that , in this example , @xmath177 gets mapped into @xmath26 .",
    "we may now apply the transformation formula ( [ confcov ] ) .",
    "the correlation function on the left is some ( as yet ) unknown function of @xmath26 , and it is simply a matter of working out the jacobian . after some algebra , @xmath178      we are already in a position where we can deduce part of the main result .",
    "we begin with the partition functions corresponding to the geometry of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , in which the potts spins on the segments @xmath10 and @xmath11 are fixed , and the rest are free . as we showed earlier , the crossing probability is given by the limit as @xmath48 of the partition functions @xmath179 and @xmath57 . according to our analysis above these",
    "may be written , as @xmath9 , @xmath180 here we have introduced the scaling dimension @xmath181 of the @xmath182 bcc operator , which will depend on @xmath30 , but not on @xmath1 or @xmath50 .",
    "now the riemann mapping theorem assures us that there exists a conformal mapping of the interior of the region @xmath6 to that of the unit disc , and thence , by a simple mbius transformation , to the upper half plane @xmath101 .",
    "thus we may use ( [ confcov ] ) to relate the ratios of partition functions in the two geometries ..",
    "this requires that the boundary @xmath7 be differentiable at that point .",
    "there are interesting additional factors when the boundary has a corner at one of these points ( as happens in the relevant case of the rectangle )",

    "thus percolation has stronger properties under conformal transformations than do more general critical theories .",
    "this may be traced to the fact that its partition function is equal to 1 . _",
    "we have already discussed the continuum limit of the transfer matrix on strip of width @xmath125 , and introduced the concept of a state space spanned by the eigenvectors of the operator @xmath148 .",

    "it may be shown that the above is given by the crossing formula ( [ crossing ] ) with the cross - ratio @xmath438 .",

    "however , it is clear that percolation is somewhat special as in some sense the measure , suitably defined , is conformally _ invariant _ _ , rather than merely covariant as is believed to occur in most critical systems .",

    "<S> these lectures give an introduction to the methods of conformal field theory as applied to deriving certain results in two - dimensional critical percolation : namely the probability that there exists at least one cluster connecting two disjoint segments of the boundary of a simply connected region ; and the mean number of such clusters . </S>",
    "<S> no previous familiarity with conformal field theory is assumed , but in the course of the argument many of its important concepts are introduced in as simple a manner as possible . </S>",
    "<S> a brief account is also given of some recent alternative approaches to deriving these kinds of result .    </S>",
