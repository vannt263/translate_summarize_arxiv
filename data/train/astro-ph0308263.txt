    "several authors have suggested that very high pressure of ism expected in major galaxy merging can be responsible for the rapid ( triggered ) collapse of gmcs and the subsequent gc formation ( e.g. , elmegreen & efremov 1997 ; bekki et al .",
    "we numerically investigate the key questions on this gc formation scenario : whether or not the star formation efficiency within a gmc under such high pressure of ism can be as high as that ( @xmath0 50 % , e.g. , hills 1980 ) required for the bound cluster formation . figure 1 describes that the high pressure of the ism can continue to strongly compress the cloud without losing a significant amount of gas from the cloud . as the strong compression proceeds",
    ", the internal density / pressure of the cloud can rise so significantly that a gc can form from the gas with a starburst ( see the caption of fig.1 for the detail of this ) ."

    "<S> the star formation efficiency within a gmc in galaxy mergers can rise up from a few percent to @xmath4 80 percent , depending on the shapes and the temperature of the gmc . </S>",
