    "a ubiquitous feature of galaxy evolution is the transformation of galaxies from blue actively star - forming systems into red passive systems ( @xmath5 * ? ? ?",
    ". there has been significant debate about the factors affecting such transitions ( @xmath5 * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , the likely timescales over which the transformation occurs ( @xmath5 * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and the morphological changes associated with the quenching of star formation ( @xmath5 * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the general consensus is that a complex mixture of both galaxy mass ( mass quenching - here we define as quenching processes internal to the galaxy ) and local environmental effects ( environmental quenching - which we define as externally driven quenching processes ) are the two key factors in driving this transition .",
    "however , the relative contributions for both effects as a function of other galaxy properties , such as stellar mass , are far from clear .",
    "multiple studies have suggested that at high stellar masses ( log@xmath0[m@xmath1/m@xmath2@xmath610 ) galaxies are predominately quenched via non - environmental effects , which are proportional to their stellar mass and largely independent of local galaxy - galaxy interactions ( passive fractions increase to higher stellar masses , @xmath5 * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is likely due to the increasing central to satellite fraction with increasing stellar mass .    at intermediate stellar masses ( @xmath7log@xmath0[m@xmath1/m@xmath2@xmath810.0 )",
    "passive fractions are lowest @xcite and quenching likely occurs via starvation ( quenching timescales are comparable to gas depletion timescales ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and at the lowest stellar masses ( primarily local group galaxies at log@xmath0[m@xmath1/m@xmath2@xmath88.0 ) quenching is likely to occur on much shorter timescales which are comparable to the dynamical timescale of the host halo , and are likely due to ram pressure stripping @xcite .",
    "these studies suggest that different quenching processes dominate the transition from star forming to passive systems at distinct stellar masses , and that there is a characteristic stellar mass scale between environmental quenching via ram pressure stripping of cold gas , environmental quenching via starvation , and mass quenching - with these transitions occurring around log@xmath0[m@xmath1/m@xmath2@xmath98 and log@xmath0[m@xmath1/m@xmath2@xmath910 respectively .",
    "analysis of these processes is made more problematic by varying gas - to - stellar mass ratios , which are found to increase significantly to lower stellar masses ( @xmath5 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) - typically galaxies at these masses are abundant in star - forming gas , prior to being acted on by external processes .",
    "note that historically there has been significant debate regarding the significance of ram pressure stripping in quenching dwarf galaxies in cluster environments ( @xmath5 * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) - with the most recent predictions suggesting it is a necessary processes to produce the observed distribution of dwarf - spheroidal / elliptical galaxies",
    ".    however , to date the majority of studies into the environmental effects of star formation are at the higher mass end of these characteristic masses ( log@xmath0[m@xmath1/m@xmath2@xmath69.5 ) .",
    "the bulk of this analysis comes from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , @xmath5 * ? ? ? * ) and galaxy and mass assembly survey ( gama - see following section ) . in the former ,",
    "the work of @xcite and others , has highlighted the large scale environmental effects on star - formation in galaxies , while the extensive work of the galaxy pairs in sdss group @xcite have probed deep into the effects of local galaxy - galaxy interactions on star - formation processes . in the latter ,",
    "the gama survey has been used in numerous studies to investigate the local and large - scale environmental affects on star - formation ( @xmath5 * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "more recently , @xcite has shown that the effects of galaxy - galaxy interactions in modifying star formation in gama galaxies is a complex process , where both pair mass ratio and primary / secondary status within the pair ( central / satellite ) determine whether a galaxy has its star formation enhanced or suppressed in the interaction .",
    "the davies et al .",
    "work only covers the 9.5@xmath8log@xmath0[m@xmath1/m@xmath2@xmath811.0 range , but directly shows that secondary galaxies in minor mergers ( the satellite systems identified in the work discussed above ) are the most likely to have their star - formation suppressed by an interaction , and that this suppression is occurring on relatively short timescales ( @xmath10myr ) . as such , we may be directly witnessing starvation occurring in these galaxies as they transition from star - forming to quiescent systems .",
    "in contrast , davies et al also find that enhancements to star formation are strongest in major mergers at around log@xmath0[m@xmath1/m@xmath2@xmath11 , which is close to the lowest passive fraction of satellites ( see summary in figure 6 of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "hence , it is likely that galaxy interactions at these masses are enhancing star formation in satellite galaxies and reducing satellite passive fractions .",
    "these variations in star - formation processes are closely linked to interaction timescale , which is shortest around log@xmath0[m@xmath1/m@xmath2@xmath11 and increases to lower stellar masses ( @xmath5 * ? ? ? * ) . if interacting galaxies take significant time to become passive ( @xmath5 via starvation , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) then we may only witness the passive phase in low - mass systems ( galaxies around log@xmath0[m@xmath1/m@xmath2@xmath11 will merge too quickly to reach their passive phase ) .",
    "we explore this premise further in this paper .    in the lower stellar mass regime ( log@xmath0[m@xmath1/m@xmath2@xmath89.5 ) sample sizes are small and/or low mass pairs are not split from the global population ( @xmath5 the galaxy pairs in sdss work ) . the @xcite work does extend to log@xmath0[m@xmath1/m@xmath2@xmath69.0 and they find that passive galaxies at the low - mass end of their sample predominately reside in over - dense environments , and such galaxies are largely non - existent in the field .",
    "they go on to argue that the mass - quenching efficiency for such low - mass galaxies is extremely low , and environmental quenching must be the dominant factor in producing red low - mass systems @xcite .",
    "some recent work has specifically targeted low mass galaxy - galaxy interactions - at around the transition mass between the proposed starvation quenching and ram pressure stripping quenching scenarios .",
    "these studies are also largely based on small nearby galaxy samples from sdss ( @xmath5 * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or local group galaxies ( @xmath5 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) - which may be atypical of the general galaxy population . however , the results agree that galaxy - galaxy interactions are significant in forming passive low - mass galaxies , and a combination of these results suggest ( see figure 6 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that we are beginning to probe the characteristic mass scales between starvation and ram pressure stripping scenarios .    in a converse , but complementary approach , @xcite find that essentially all local log@xmath0[m@xmath1/m@xmath2@xmath89.0 field galaxies are star forming , and that the passive fraction at these stellar masses drops rapidly as a function of distance from massive host galaxies .",
    "this also suggests that local environment plays a significant role in producing passive , low - mass systems ( also see earlier work of * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* etc ) , and that isolated evolution alone fails to produce passive low mass galaxies",
    ".    however , the environmental quenching of low - mass satellites is far from ubiquitous .",
    "multiple recent studies ( @xmath5 * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have shown relatively modest fractions of @xmath12log@xmath0[m@xmath1/m@xmath2@xmath89.5 satellites are quenched ( 20 - 30% ) and that the efficiency of satellite quenching is deceasing with time @xcite .",
    "as such , quenching via starvation is likely to be driven by factors other than satellite stellar mass , potentially both host halo mass and interaction timescale .",
    "+ theoretical modelling can offer some insights into this process , with contemporary semi - analytic simulations accurately reproducing the observed galaxy merger rates at low redshift @xcite .",
    "these simulations also predict that secular transitions from active to passive galaxies are extremely problematic at the lowest stellar masses ( log@xmath0(m@xmath1/m@xmath13)@xmath89.0 , they predict extremely low passive fractions in field environments , @xmath5 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and constrain the likely quenching timescale of interactions - highlighting that these timescales must be comparable to gas depletion timescales for intermediate mass satellites ( @xmath5 * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , the relatively simple model predictions of @xcite find that in order to produce the observed passive satellite population , requires either very - long quenching timescales or environmental quenching triggers which are not well matched to satellite accretion .",
    "previously , the gama sample has not been used to specifically target quenching in low mass galaxies .",
    "however , its extension to @xmath14dex lower in stellar mass than sdss at distances @xmath910 - 100mpc - closer to representing a cosmic average , high completeness to close pairs @xcite , extensive group catalogue @xcite , and multiple sfr diagnostics ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , allows us to investigate the passive fraction in both pair and group environment and evaluate the relative contribution of environmental effects in producing quiescent galaxies . in the following paper , we identify passive and star - forming galaxies in the gama sample and investigate the environmental distribution of passive galaxies as a function of stellar masses , specifically focusing on the mass range close to the proposed starvation / ram pressure stripping transition . while this work displays the distribution of passive / star forming galaxies over a broad range of stellar masses , we specifically focus on passive galaxies at the low - mass end ( log@xmath0[m@xmath1/m@xmath2@xmath3 ) and the effect of galaxy - galaxy interactions . for a complementary analysis of the larger scale environmental effects on star - formation in spiral galaxies at log@xmath0[m@xmath1/m@xmath2@xmath15",
    ", we refer the reader to grootes et al .",
    ", in prep .    in this work ,",
    "we take a slightly different approach to previous studies and do not initially define sources as either a central or satellite galaxy , but consider all pair systems .",
    "@xcite find that satellite galaxies are much more likely to be quenched if their host galaxy is also passive .",
    "as such , the same environmental effects may drive passive evolution in both centrals and satellites ( @xmath16 is it purely the interaction that drives the quenching in both galaxies , or the large scale environment ? ) .",
    "in addition , we also consider major mergers , where the definition of central / satellite is somewhat ambiguous .",
    "we do split our sample into the primary / secondary pair galaxy class defined in @xcite , which can be considered a central / satellite separation for minor mergers .",
    "we also investigate a number of different environments ( group , pair , group and not pair , isolated - see section [ sec : data ] for details ) to evaluate the relative effect of each on forming passive galaxies .",
    "however , care must be taken . in this work",
    "we assume that if quenched fractions correlate with specific environmental metrics , that there is a causal relationship between quenching processes and interactions with the local environment .",
    "recent studies have shown that using @xmath17",
    "@xmath18 @xmath19 between numerical simulations and sdss galaxies , the colour distribution in over - dense environments can be reproduced via halo assembly bias @xcite alone ( @xmath5 * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , further work has used the ` galactic conformity ' results of @xcite to show that assembly bias will naturally produce increased passive fractions in over - dense environments in the complete absence of any post infall processes , such as the environmental quenching processes discussed above @xcite . however",
    ", these works focus on higher mass galaxies than those discussed here ( log@xmath0[m@xmath1/m@xmath2@xmath20 ) .",
    "in addition , the @xcite work only finds conformity in gas rich , star - forming galaxies at log@xmath0[m@xmath1/m@xmath2@xmath20 - not quenched gas poor systems .",
    "we also note that the @xcite ` galactic conformity ' is consistent with our previous results in @xcite , where when considering the full pair galaxy population , both primary and secondary galaxies ( i.e. central and satellites ) have their sf boosted to a similar degree .",

    "we use a standard @xmath21cdm cosmology with h@xmath22=70kms@xmath23mpc@xmath23 , @xmath24=0.7 and @xmath25=0.3 .",
    "the data used in this work is derived and selected in a similar manner to that described in davies et al .",
    "2015 . here",
    "we briefly discuss the datasets used and refer the reader to previous work for further details .",
    "the gama survey is a highly complete multi - wavelength database @xcite and galaxy redshift ( @xmath26 ) survey @xcite covering 280deg@xmath27 to a main survey limit of @xmath28mag in three equatorial ( g09 , g12 and g15 ) and two southern ( g02 and g23 ) regions .",
    "the spectroscopic survey was undertaken using the aaomega fibre - fed spectrograph @xcite in conjunction with the two - degree field ( 2df , * ? ? ?",

    "full details of the gama survey can be found in @xcite and @xcite . in this work",
    "we utilise the first 5 years of data obtained and frozen for internal team use , referred to as gama ii .",
    "the gamaii is not currently publicly available , but is due to be fully released in the near future .    in this work",
    "we shall use galaxy group and pair membership to delineate its local environment .",
    "we use the gama g@xmath31c catalogue which includes the identification of all galaxy groups and pairs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* also see @xcite ) .",
    "briefly , the gama group catalogue is produced using a bespoke friends - of - friends based grouping algorithm which was tested extensively on mock gama galaxy light cones and assigns @xmath32 of gama galaxies to multiplicity @xmath33 pairs and groups @xcite . in this work",
    "we define a group as a system with multiplicity n@xmath62 .",
    "the gama pair catalogue is further detailed in @xcite and @xcite , where pair galaxies are selected on both radial velocity and physical positional offset using sdss imaging and gama aat spectra . in this work",
    "we use the full pair sample , defined as galaxies with physical separation @xmath8100h@xmath23kpc and velocity separation @xmath8 1000 kms@xmath23 - over which pair galaxies have been found to affect each other s star - formation ( @xmath5 * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while we ca nt rule out that pair galaxies are not truly interacting systems , but simply chance position and line of sight velocity correlated sources , care is taken in @xcite to determine the likelihood of pair systems being physically interacting . in this work , all pair systems are visually classified for observed disturbance using sdss optical imaging .",
    "figure 6 of @xcite displays the fraction of morphologically disturbed sources as a function of tangential and radial separation , and highlights that the pair selection method in gama is robust at identifying visually disturbed ( definitively interacting ) sources , specifically as small separations . using the group and pair classifications",
    ", we also define samples of systems in pairs and/or groups , isolated galaxies which are not identified as being in a group or pair , and ` locally isolated group galaxies ' - which are in a group but not in a pair .",
    "stellar masses for all galaxies are derived from the @xmath34 photometry for all gama ii galaxies @xcite .",
    "these stellar masses are calculated using a @xcite -like imf .",
    "as in davies et al ( 2015 ) we further split pair galaxies into the primary or secondary systems ( by stellar mass ) and by pair mass ratio to identify pair galaxies as being either part of a potential major merger ( mass ratio @xmath83:1 ) or minor merger ( mass ratio @xmath63:1 ) - assuming the pair galaxies will eventually merge , which will clearly not be the case for all systems .",
    "however , in this work we use the well known terms of ` major ' and ` minor ' merger to denote pairs of different mass ratio .",
    "we restrict our sample to galaxies at @xmath35 and with gama redshift quality flag @xmath36 , for which all galaxies have pair / group assignments - the extent of the g@xmath31c catalogue is @xmath37 .",
    "we also minimise active galactic nuclei ( agn ) contamination in our sample , which may potentially bias sfr estimates , by excluding both optically bright agn and composite sources using the bpt diagnostic diagram @xcite in an identical manner as in figure 1 of @xcite .              using the full gama data set directly is likely to induce significant biases in our results due to sample selection .",
    "any spectroscopic sample will preferentially identify actively star - forming galaxies over passive galaxies , and this effect will be more apparent with increasing redshift . in order to minimise this , we define a volume limited sample based on the stellar mass detection limits of passive galaxies .",
    "firstly we apply a maximum upper redshift limit of @xmath38 to minimise redshift evolution over our sample and biasing it towards high mass systems .",
    "below @xmath39 we use a rolling sample selection at each stellar mass , defined by the lowest detection limit of the passive systems in gama ( see the following section for sf / passive selections ) . to define this limit we split the passive population in @xmath40 bins from @xmath41 and determined the lower stellar mass limit which encompass the mean minus 2.25 @xmath42 the standard deviation in each bin ( found to accurately constrain the distribution of passive sources ) .",
    "we then fit a second order polynomial to the lower limits with the form :    @xmath43 > -65.2z^2 + 24.13z+7.71.\\ ] ]    figure [ fig : mass_vs_z ] shows the volume limited sample used in this work . in this manner , we exclude star - forming systems which would not be detected in our sample if they were in fact passive and at the same stellar mass , and do not bias our selection based on our ability to identify lower - mass star forming systems .",
    "potential biases in our analysis arise though group / pair assignments discussed above .",
    "there is a complex function which defines if systems are assigned to groups and pairs based on redshift , stellar mass , group mass , group occupation , pair mass ratio , etc .",
    "for example , we can not rule out that non - pair galaxies in gama have a faint companion which sits below the gama detection limits , or in fact that non - group galaxies do not have a significant number of sources below this limit ( which if detected would cause the system to be identified as a group galaxy ) .",
    "however , for the former case , this scenario would place the galaxy in question as the central system in a low - mass major merger - where the bulk of this work will focus on satellite galaxies . in the latter ,",
    "this scenario would place the system as the central galaxy in a low - mass group ( m@xmath44few@xmath45m@xmath13 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) - potentially where group environmental effects are less significant . at some point",
    "we must define a group / non - group selection at a specific group mass limit , as ultimately if selections were indefinitely extended to lower and lower stellar mass , almost all systems would reside in a group structure .",
    "as such , our group classification is defined as the systems falling within a group of m@xmath46 few@xmath45m@xmath13 - and any results derived in this paper are conditional on this caveat .",
    "another potential bias arises from the dependance of the identification of pair systems based on the star - forming characteristics of each pair galaxy .",
    "given the differing selection limits for passive and star forming galaxies , pair systems are more likely to be identified if both systems are star - forming , and additionally , passive + star forming pair systems are more likely to be identified if the larger mass galaxy is passive , than if the lower mass galaxy is passive . in order to minimise this bias ,",
    "we have only included pair galaxies where @xmath47 systems meet our selection limits ( as shown in figure [ fig : mass_vs_z ] ) .",
    "this essentially removes pair systems where one of the galaxies is star - forming , but lies below the selection boundary for passive system .",
    "we note that the galaxies in these pairs are completely removed from our analysis - @xmath16 not included in our non - pair samples .",
    "to determine the affect of local environment on turning galaxies passive , we must first identify passive / star - forming systems in the gama dataset .",
    "we do this for two separate sfr indicators and both indicators in combination .",
    "firstly , we derive h@xmath48 sfrs as in davies et al ( 2015 ) using the most recent gama emission line measurements and the sfr calibration of @xcite , based on the kennicutt relation @xcite - with improved stellar absorption correction from @xcite .",
    "the @xcite calibration uses the balmer decrement and gama aperture correction to convert observed h@xmath48 fluxes to sfrs - for further details see davies et al ( 2015 ) .",
    "the gama emission line analysis assigns a h@xmath48 measurement to all sources ( irrespective of the presence of a detectable h@xmath48 line ) and as such , systems with no detectable h@xmath48 , will have low ( but non - zero ) sfrs .    secondly , we use the full sed fits to the 21-band photometric data available to all gama ii sources ( galex - uv to @xmath49 - 500@xmath50 m , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) using the energy balance code - magphys @xcite .",
    "full details of the gama magphys analysis will be presented in wright et al .",
    "( in prep ) .    note that the h@xmath48 sfrs described above use salpeter - like imfs , while our stellar masses and sed - based sfrs use chabrier - like imfs . as such",
    ", we scale the h@xmath48 sfrs by a factor of 1.5 to account for this discrepancy @xcite .",
    "however , our sf / passive selections used in this paper are based solely on the ssfr in our sample , and therefore are not sensitive to choice of imf ( @xmath16 given a different imf , we would simply find a different sf / passive selection ) .    in",
    "@xcite we use multiple sfr indicators to probe sf in pair systems ( including mir and fir ) .",
    "however , in our current analysis we only use the h@xmath48 and magphys sfrs .",
    "the mir and fir data used in gama have a significantly large psf which may cause contamination between closely separated pair galaxies ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "while care is taken in the gama to deblend flux to the relevant galaxies , this problem become increasingly difficult at low stellar mass , high mass ratio pairs ( those primarily of interest in this work ) .",
    "as such , errors in deriving sfr in the mir / fir for low mass pair galaxies may be significant . while this error may also cause erroneous magphys fitting results , the energy balance fitting method and application of realistic galaxy templates , goes some way to reduce this issue .",
    "in addition , we will only use the magphys sfrs to remove sources from our passive and star - forming h@xmath48 selection to produce a more robust sample ( see below ) , and do not use the sfrs directly in the rest of the work .",
    "the h@xmath48 sfr measurements are based on @xmath51 aperture fibre measurements and as such , are not significantly affected by close source confusion . in this manner , we minimise any issues with deblending flux in closely separated sources .",
    "we note that the sfr timescales probed by the h@xmath48 and magphys sfrs are different but comparable .",
    "probes star - formation on timescales of @xmath52myr , while the full sed sfrs typically probe @xmath53myr ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a more comprehensive description of sfr indicator timescales ) .",
    "h@xmath48 is therefore likely to be sensitive to short duration changes in sf - which may be induced by galaxy interactions , but is also sensitive to aperture corrections which may bias derived sfrs .",
    "here we use h@xmath48 both independently and in combination with the more robust , but less sensitive to short timescale variation , full sed sfr .",
    "we derive specific sfrs ( ssfr ) using each indicator and the stellar masses of @xcite , and plot the distribution of all gama ii sources for both h@xmath48 and magphys sed ssfrs ( black line , figure [ fig : ssfr_dist ] ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : ssfr_dist ] we see a clear distinction between star - forming and passive galaxies forming two largely distinct gaussian - like distributions in log[ssfr ] space .",
    "this separation is more clearly defined for h@xmath48 than the sed sfrs as there is a clear binary split between passive and star - forming systems ( the presence or lack of the h@xmath48 emission line ) .",
    "we fit the full distribution of sources ( black line ) with a double peaked normal distribution ( orange line ) , using a least squares fit , and define sources as passive if they lie below the lower peak plus 1@xmath54 , star - forming if they lie above the upper peak minus 1@xmath54 and ` intermediate ' if they fall between these two cuts - we then exclude the ` intermediate ' sources ( see figure [ fig : ssfr_dist ] for separation lines ) .",
    "this selection primarily identifies sources which are either definitively passive or star - forming and removes any ambiguous sources .",
    "while the sample will be incomplete to all passive / star - forming galaxies , it applies strict constraints on identifying truly passive and star - forming systems and is likely to have little contamination from the ambiguous ` intermediate ' sources .",
    "as noted above , initially we perform this selection independently , however , some sources are better defined using h@xmath48 and some better defined using a full sed fit , in addition measurement error may cause either sfr indicator to be spuriously high / low in star - formation ( see figure [ fig : ssfr_dist_ha_sel ] ) . as",
    "such , we also define samples of star - forming and passive galaxies which are selected as such using @xmath47 methods - these sources are likely to have a low contamination from incorrectly assigned sources as their star - formation rates are defined in two completely distinct and separate manners .",
    "we have visually inspected all sources in our passive selection at log@xmath0m@xmath1@xmath89.0 and find that none show evidence of h@xmath48 emission , and hence are likely to be truly passive galaxies .",
    "we also visually inspected a subsample of sources in our star - forming selection at the same mass range and find all show evidence of h@xmath48 emission .    in figures [ fig : ssfr_dist ] and [ fig : ssfr_dist_ha_sel ] we also split our sample into those galaxies defined as being in a pair , either pair or group and all other sources ( not in a pair or group - which we define as isolated in this work ) .",
    "a higher fraction of passive sources are found in group and pair environments than are isolated - the passive peak is significantly larger for group and pair galaxies than for the isolated galaxies .",
    "this highlights the well known trend of galaxy star - formation in group environments , for example see @xcite .",
    "in this work we wish to investigate how local environment affects galaxies as a function of stellar mass , specifically at low stellar masses . in figure [ fig : passive_fractions ] we split our sample in @xmath55m=0.5log@xmath0(m@xmath13 ) bins and show the fraction of galaxies defined as passive ( top ) and star - forming ( bottom ) , in the previous section , as a function of stellar mass and split by our environmental metrics - in a pair and or group , just in a pair , in pair and the secondary ( satellite ) galaxy and not in a pair or group .",
    "the translucent polygons in these and other plots display the 1@xmath54 error range derived assuming a binomial distribution @xcite .    the passive fraction decreases and star - forming fraction increases with decreasing stellar mass in all environments , as globally low - mass galaxies are more actively star - forming ( the well known downsizing paradigm - that low - mass galaxies are more actively star - forming in the local universe , @xmath5 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , it is interesting to note the differences between each environmental metric .",
    "pair and group galaxies have a higher fraction of passive galaxies than the global distribution at all stellar masses ( consistent with results seen in figure [ fig : ssfr_dist ] ) .",
    "we also isolate secondary galaxies in minor mergers ( orange line ) - these are essentially the satellite systems identified in previous work .",
    "while they have the highest low - mass passive fraction of all of our environmental metrics , this fraction is still lower than previous sdss - based work . at 8.0@xmath8log@xmath0[m@xmath1/m@xmath2@xmath89.0 ,",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite find a passive fraction of @xmath56 ( albeit from the same sample ) , while we find @xmath910 - 20% .",
    "this difference could either be due to sample selection ( our passive selection based on h@xmath48 ssfr may be more stringent than their h@xmath48 ew selection ) or a difference in stellar mass estimations .",
    "for example , if we were to include all ` intermediate ' defined sources as passive in our h@xmath48 selection , we would obtain a low - mass massive fraction of @xmath57 ( comparable to the previous results ) .",
    "we also note that our passive fractions at @xmath58log@xmath0[m@xmath1/m@xmath2@xmath811.0 are consistent with @xcite , @xcite and @xcite at around 30 - 50% ( see figure 5 & 6 of * ? ? ?",
    "* for a summary of passive fractions as a function of stellar mass ) .",

    "we take all true satellite pair galaxies in our sample , calculate ssfr@xmath22 from the median ssfr of all non - pair galaxies at @xmath92dex in stellar mass , and use their stellar mass and pair mass ratio to calculate a model ssfr vs interaction timescale .",
    "we then randomly select a ssfr at @xmath110 .",
    "this provides a predicted ssfr for all satellite galaxies in our data assuming our model to be correct . from this",
    "we calculate a passive fraction as a function of stellar mass , as in the previous section .",
    "we repeat this process 500 times to quantify any biases in the random selection at times below @xmath87 .",
    "figure [ fig : model_fraction ] displays the model passive fraction as a function of stellar mass for all runs , and the mean / median of the runs . comparing this to the top panel of figure [ fig : summary ] ( the true distribution in the data ) , we find that our model predictions show similar characteristics , they are both low at log@xmath0[m@xmath1/m@xmath2=10.5 and rise with deceasing stellar mass to log@xmath0[m@xmath1/m@xmath2@xmath98.75 , and then slightly drop to log@xmath0[m@xmath1/m@xmath2@xmath98.25 .",
    "our model passive fractions are higher at log@xmath0[m@xmath1/m@xmath2@xmath89.0 and lower at log@xmath0[m@xmath1/m@xmath2@xmath69.0 , but are largely similar in shape to the observed distribution .",
    "the drop in passive fractions at the lowest stellar masses is interesting , and is seen in both the data and models .",
    "this drop is potentially due to quenching timescales approaching a considerable fraction of the age of the universe . at low stellar masses",
    "only satellites which began an interaction in the very early universe will have sufficient time to become quenched via starvation .",
    "this is in fact one of the reasons for proposing the ram pressure quenching scenario at the lowest stellar masses - low - mass local group galaxies do not have sufficient time to become passive by any other method .        while this model is simplistic and contains speculative assumptions , it is largely consistent with the observed passive fractions",
    ". it provides a model where interaction timescale is the governing factor in the observed passive fractions as a function of stellar mass , and roughly produces the necessary distribution of passive fractions in satellite galaxies - being low at log@xmath0[m@xmath1/m@xmath2@xmath910 and consistently rising to lower stellar masses , and then plateauing / dropping at log@xmath0[m@xmath1/m@xmath2@xmath88.5 .    to compare our model passive fractions with the observed passive fractions , figure [ fig : model_fraction_vs_obs ]",
    "shows the ratio of the two distributions , in the low stellar mass regime . the solid line and points display the observed passive fraction divided by the mean model passive fraction ( gold line in figure [ fig : model_fraction ] ) . at 8.0@xmath8log@xmath0[m@xmath1/m@xmath2@xmath89.5",
    "the model is roughly consistent with the observed distribution ( within a factor of two in the region of interest in this work ) . at higher stellar masses",
    "the model passive fraction is essentially zero , and can not be directly compared to the observed distribution - our model only probes starvation quenching scenarios , which are likely to only be appropriate in the 8.0@xmath8log@xmath0[m@xmath1/m@xmath2@xmath810 regime .",
    "we have investigated the environmental distribution of passive and star - forming galaxies in the gama sample .",
    "we find that passive fractions are higher in group / pair environments than isolated environments for all stellar masses , suggesting that group / pair interactions have a significant role in producing quiescent systems .",
    "we find that the global passive fractions drop with decreasing stellar mass in all environments until log@xmath0[m@xmath1/m@xmath2@xmath111 . for pair galaxies we see",
    "an increase in the passive fraction in our lowest stellar mass bin , potentially indicating that we are witnessing the increase in passive fraction predicted from ram pressure quenching in low - mass galaxies @xcite .",
    "we highlight that log@xmath0[m@xmath1/m@xmath2@xmath65 is an important transition mass , below which interactions have a significant role in suppressing star - formation in galaxies .",
    "we investigate the passive fraction of pair galaxies in comparison to the global passive fraction , and show that the pair passive fraction increases with decreasing stellar mass , suggesting the effect of interactions in producing passive galaxies becomes more significant at lower stellar masses .",
    "however , we highlight that this trend is similar to the changes in interaction timescale with stellar mass .",
    "we propose , consistently with other authors , that the formation of passive galaxies at log@xmath0[m@xmath1/m@xmath2@xmath112 primarily occurs via starvation due to an interaction .",
    "the interaction initially boosts star formation in the satellite galaxy , but inhibits the system from replenishing its gas ( or potentially such gas in the local environment has already been accreted by its larger companion ) . as such",
    ", the galaxy consumes all of its gas , starves and become passive over an extended time period .",
    "we suggest that the increased passive fraction at low stellar masses are simply due to extended interaction timescales .",
    "essentially , all galaxies would eventually become passive in an interaction , however this process will occur over long timescales ( @xmath79gyr )",
    ". interactions of galaxies around log@xmath0[m@xmath1/m@xmath2@xmath113 are exceptionally short ( @xmath81gyr ) and therefore , the galaxies merge prior to their passive phase . for less massive galaxies , interaction timescales",
    "are dramatically increased , and a large fraction of galaxies reach their passive phase prior to merging .",
    "this causes us to observe an increased passive fraction with decreasing stellar mass .",
    "we produce a simplistic model , where satellites have an initial , short duration , burst of star - formation and then a exponential decline in star - formation ( used to mimic the starvation processes ) .",
    "this model largely reproduces the shape of the observed satellite passive fraction .",
    "the prospects for future studies to probe this scenario are tantalising .",
