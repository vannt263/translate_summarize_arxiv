    "liquid crystals ( lcs ) are known to demonstrate a very rich variety of interesting optical phenomena which have been studied intensively during the last two decades .",
    "a nematic lc behaves optically as a uniaxial anisotropic medium with the optical axis along the local molecular orientation described by the director @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , when light propagates through the nematic , its electric field exerts a torque on the molecules which can induce molecular reorientation .",
    "when there is only an ordinary wave in the lc ( polarization perpendicular to the plane containing the optical axis and wavevector ) , the initial distribution of the director becomes unstable when the intensity of light reaches a certain critical value .",
    "this is the so - called light induced freedericksz transition ( lift ) .",
    "the director reorientation leads to a change of birefringence and , as a consequence , the polarization is changed as light propagates through the layer @xcite .",
    "it is known @xcite that a periodic equilibrium configuration of the nematic director can appear in a thin - film lc in the magnetic or electric field induced freedericksz transition under certain conditions .",
    "our work is devoted to the search of analogous phenomena in the lift of nematic lcs including the dye - doped case .",
    "we will show that the hopf bifurcation that occurs as a secondary bifurcation after the lift leads indeed to a periodic pattern , although the mechanism is here quite different ( see conclusions ) .",
    "doping is important because the lift threshold of a dye - doped nematic can be two orders of magnitude smaller than for a pure nematic .",
    "the nature of this anomalously low threshold was the subject of numerous studies ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the fact that the threshold intensity is low allows the spot size of the light to be much larger than the thickness of the layer , thus a large aspect ratio system can be realized .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ theoret_model ] we present the theoretical description of our problem . in sec .",
    "[ section_lin ] we perform the linear stability analysis of the homeotropic state which gives the threshold for the lift . the numerical method of calculating the stationary distorted state is described in sec .",
    "[ st_dist ] . finally , in sec .",
    "[ stab_anal ] , we do the linear stability analysis of the stationary distorted state with respect to general perturbations in the plane of the nematic layer .",
    "we consider a linearly - polarized plane wave incident at a small oblique angle @xmath1 on a layer of dye - doped nematic lc which has initially homeotropic alignment ( see fig .",
    "the light is polarized along the @xmath2-axis i.e. , we deal with an ordinary wave .",
    "strong anchoring of the nematic at the boundaries of the layer is assumed .",
    "the optical torque acting on the director is given by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the amplitude of the optical electric field , @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 is the dielectric anisotropy and @xmath7(@xmath8 ) is the dielectric permittivity ( at optical frequency ) perpendicular ( parallel ) to @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 phenomenologically describes the effect of certain dye dopants ( @xmath11 in a pure lc ) and can be both positive and negative and depends on dye concentration , molecular structures of both host and dye materials , on the wavelength of light , and on the temperature @xcite .",
    "obviously , the electrical part of the free energy will contain the same factor @xmath12 .",
    "the density of the free energy of the dye - doped nematic lc is thus assumed in the form : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the standard frank free energy density and @xmath15 are respectively the splay , twist and bend elastic constants of the lc @xcite .",
    "we first assume that the director components depend only on @xmath16 .",
    "we introduce the angles @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( see fig.1 ) so that @xmath19 . using the standard variational principle @xcite and taking the dissipation function in the form @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is an effective rotational viscosity ,",
    "the equations of motion for @xmath17 and @xmath18 can be derived .",
    "in addition we need maxwell s equations to determine the electric field .",
    "these equations contain the complex dielectric tensor which depends on the director components :    = 7.true cm    @xmath22    in ( [ tensor_e ] ) @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the imaginary parts of the dielectric permittivity for @xmath4 perpendicular and parallel to @xmath9 respectively .",
    "they describe the absorption effect by the dye , so they vanish in pure lcs .",
    "the magnetic anisotropy at optical frequencies can be neglected .",
    "since the components of the dielectric tensor depend on the @xmath26-coordinate only , we may use the stratified medium approach for describing wave propagation @xcite .",
    "we write the electric and magnetic fields in the form : @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the wavenumber in vacuum and @xmath29 . here",
    "@xmath30 are amplitudes that vary slowly in time compared to @xmath31 and obey the equation : @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 the @xmath26-component of the electric field can be found from the following relation : @xmath35 we will examine the case @xmath36 so that the preferred orientation corresponds to the director parallel to the electric field @xmath37 .",
    "since in our geometry initially @xmath38 , the homeotropic state will cease to be stable above some critical intensity of the incident light .",
    "the reorientation of the lc leads to modification of the electric field polarization inside the lc owing to the fact that it becomes an inhomogeneous anisotropic medium .",
    "we first perform the linear stability analysis of the homeotropic state ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the linearized equation of motion for @xmath18 has the following simple form : @xmath40 here @xmath41 is the @xmath2-component of the electric field amplitude for the undistorted nematic ( homeotropic orientation ) and @xmath42 is the @xmath26-component of the field that is caused by nematic reorientation ( calculated to the first order in @xmath43 ) .",
    "it is easily seen that in the undistorted lc the light maintains its polarization inside the layer , so that we have only one nonzero component of the electric field @xmath44 , where @xmath45 ( terms of the order of @xmath46 in @xmath47 are neglected because @xmath48 ) and @xmath49 is the amplitude of the incident electric field . in the linear approximation @xmath50",
    "remains zero .",

    "( [ eq_psi]-[ez ] ) : @xmath52    substituting @xmath51 into ( [ eq_e1z ] ) in the form @xmath53 and taking into account that @xmath54 ( @xmath55 is the width of the layer ) , a first - order ode for @xmath56 can be derived . keeping in mind that @xmath57 we eventually obtain from eqs . ( [ phi],[eq_e1z ] ) the following integro - differential equation for @xmath43 : @xmath58 \\right .",

    "the parameter @xmath62 is the characteristic time of the director motion and @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the intensity of the incident light and @xmath68 is defined as : @xmath69 @xmath68 coincides with the threshold intensity of the lift for a pure nematic ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) at perpendicular incidence @xcite .",
    "( [ basic_1 ] ) reduces to one obtained in @xcite .",
    "we use a two - mode expansion with respect to @xmath26 for the angle @xmath43 with the boundary conditions @xmath72 : @xmath73 , where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are time - dependent amplitudes .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that the distorted state is asymmetric with respect to the center of the layer because of absorption and the perturbation of the light polarization inside the layer .",
    "therefore we have to include at least one mode that is symmetric and one mode that is antisymmetric with respect to the center of the layer . after projecting eq.([basic_1 ] ) onto the trial functions we have a system of two equations for the modes @xmath74 and @xmath75 : @xmath76 where the elements of the matrix @xmath77 depend on material parameters and the control parameters @xmath78 and @xmath61 ( which is proportional to @xmath79 ) .",
    "we look for solutions proportional to @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the growth rate .",
    "the procedure of deriving @xmath82 is straightforward but the expressions for these elements are too long to be presented here .",
    "the stability diagram in the @xmath83 plane can now be calculated for any given material parameters of the lc . as an example we consider the nematic 5cb doped with the dye ad1 at @xmath84 concentration .",
    "we used the following values of material parameters at the temperature @xmath85 : @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , ( absorption coefficients and refractive indices of the ordinary and extraordinary light , respectively ) , @xmath90 ( wavelength of laser ) , @xmath91 @xcite , @xmath92 , @xmath93 @xcite ; the calculations are made for a layer of @xmath94 thickness . for these parameters",
    "@xmath95 , @xmath96 .",
    "it is easy to show the following relations : @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 ( neglecting terms of the order @xmath46 ) .",
    "the stability diagram is depicted in fig .",
    "the solid line corresponds to a stationary bifurcation ( @xmath101 ) and the dashed one corresponds to a hopf bifurcation of the homeotropic state ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "these lines divide the @xmath83 plane into a stable and an unstable region of the homeotropic alignment .",
    "they join in a so called takens - bogdanov point where @xmath103 .",
    "there are two differences compared to the case of a pure lc .",
    "first , the enhancement of the orientational optical nonlinearity described by the parameter @xmath10 leads to a `` renormalization '' of the threshold intensity ( see eq .",
    "( [ porog ] ) ) .",
    "( however , since fig .",
    "2a is plotted with the renormalized threshold intensity , this does not change the appearance of the stability diagram ) .",
    "second , absorption gives rise to the attenuation of the field inside the nematic .",
    "this results in a shift of the line of primary instability to the region of higher intensities as is shown in fig .",
    "2b . from this figure",
    "one can see the quantitative difference between the case when the absorption is neglected ( dot - dashed lines ) and when the absorption is taken into account ( solid and dashed lines ) .",
    "note that the critical intensity @xmath104 for perpendicular incidence thus becomes larger than 1 .",
    "it must be noted that we supposed that the nematic is maintained at constant temperature .",
    "actually , due to the presence of the absorbing dye , the nematic will be heated by the light @xcite .",
    "we have estimated the maximum temperature difference occurring _ inside _ the nematic 5cb doped with the dye ad1 from the steady - state heat conductivity equation ( one - dimensional since we considered a plane wave ) .",
    "for the range of intensities @xmath105 this difference was found to be no more than a few kelvins .",
    "thus we can usually neglect the temperature dependence of the material parameters and we took them to be constant across the layer .",
    "after the homeotropic state looses stability via a stationary bifurcation ( at not too large angle of incidence ) , the director settles in a stationary distorted state .",
    "one obtains the stationary @xmath26-dependent reorientation of the director by variation of the free energy density ( [ free_energy ] ) with @xmath106 defined in terms of the angles @xmath107 .",
    "this gives us two ordinary second - oder differential equations for @xmath108 and @xmath109 ( now these angles can be of arbitrary magnitude ) .",
    "we will not display them here because they are long and are obtained straightforwardly .",
    "these equations contain the field components which obey maxwell s equations ( [ eq_psi ] ) .",
    "it is convenient to write ( [ eq_psi ] ) using the oldano formalism @xcite .",
    "following @xcite we write the matrix @xmath110 ( see ( [ d ] ) ) as @xmath111 , where @xmath112 and @xmath113 ,    = 7.true cm = 7.true cm = 7.true cm    @xmath114 .",
    "the matrix @xmath115 contains the @xmath26-dependent angles @xmath50 and @xmath43 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce a representation in terms of eigenfunctions of @xmath116 .",
    "the eigenvalue problem @xmath117 is solved by the eigenvalues @xmath118 and eigenvectors @xmath119 we introduce the metric tensor @xmath120 to define a scalar product between these vectors .",
    "with such a metric the eigenvectors are orthogonal to one another : @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is the `` norm '' of vector @xmath123 .",
    "the matrix @xmath116 is expressed by means of the vectors @xmath123 as @xmath124 .",
    "the four vectors @xmath123 give the polarization of four `` proper '' waves that propagate inside the layer without changing their state of polarization in the case of homeotropic alignment .",
    "the magnitudes of @xmath125 give the indices of refraction of these waves .",
    "two of these vectors @xmath126 ( @xmath127 ) correspond to backward ( forward ) propagating ordinary waves and the other two @xmath128 ( @xmath129 ) correspond to backward ( forward ) propagating extraordinary waves .",
    "the contribution of the backward waves is negligibly small because the dielectric properties of the nematic change little on the spatial scale of the wavelength @xcite .",
    "thus we can expand @xmath130 as follows @xmath131 and write ( [ eq_psi ] ) in terms of the amplitudes @xmath132 and @xmath133 : @xmath134 \\\\",

    "so , we have a system of coupled ordinary differential equations for @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 with boundary conditions @xmath137 , and initial conditions @xmath138 , @xmath139 . here @xmath140 can be related to the normalized intensity @xmath78 defined in the previous section : @xmath141 .",
    "the system of `` nematic+field '' equations ( with boundary conditions ) is invariant under the transformation @xmath142 $ ] @xmath143 @xmath144 $ ] owing to the reflection symmetry with respect to the @xmath2 direction . since the primary instability breaks this symmetry ,",
    "two different distorted states exist , which are mutual images under this transformation . for perpendicular incidence of the light",

    "the system of equations can only be solved numerically . for this purpose",
    "we introduced the new variables @xmath147 to transform our set of equations to a system of six first - oder equations which was solved by the shooting method . to guarantee that we obtain the solution which originates from the homeotropic state we started with intensities only slightly above the threshold .",
    "then , we increased @xmath78 slightly and used the values of @xmath148 obtained in the previous step as an initial guess .",
    "this procedure allowed us to derive the profiles @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 for any @xmath61 and @xmath78 above threshold .",
    "the director and field distributions for @xmath149 and @xmath150 ( @xmath151 ) are shown in figs .",
    "3,4 . in the next section",
    "we will show that for @xmath151 the stationary distorted state becomes unstable at @xmath152 , thus these figures represent the state slightly below the secondary instability .",
    "next we have performed a linear stability analysis of the distorted stationary state with respect to spatially periodic perturbations in the plane of the nematic layer . we write",
    "@xmath153 where @xmath154 and @xmath155 are small spatially periodic perturbation with wavenumbers @xmath156 and @xmath157 ; @xmath81 is the growth rate",
    ".    from the equation @xmath158 follows that @xmath159 .",
    "thus there are only two independent components of @xmath160 .",
    "we obtained two linear equations for @xmath161 and @xmath162 which contain @xmath161 , @xmath162 itself , their @xmath26 derivatives up to second oder and @xmath163 with complicated coefficients depending on the stationary distorted state @xmath164 .",
    "also , we decomposed the matrix @xmath110 ( see ( [ d ] ) ) as @xmath165 , where the matrices @xmath166 correspond to the stationary state and were defined in the previous section , and the matrix @xmath167 depends linearly on @xmath168 .",
    "after linearization of ( [ eq_psi ] ) the equations for @xmath169 can be obtained :    @xmath170    where @xmath171 are the matrix elements of @xmath172 with respect to the eigenvectors ( [ eigenvecs ] ) and the @xmath173 were defined in ( [ matr_el ] ) .",
    "we have linearized the equation ( [ eq_psi ] ) substituting @xmath59 in the form ( [ n_space ] ) . in principle",
    "we should have started from maxwell s equations because the field perturbations contain @xmath174 dependence .",
    "however this is a very good approximation because the corrections are of the oder @xmath175 , @xmath176 .    to solve the eigenvalue problem for @xmath81 we expand @xmath177 , @xmath163 with respect to @xmath26 in systems of functions which satisfy the boundary conditions ( galerkin method ) .",
    "= 7.true cm    = 7.true cm    = 7.true cm    for @xmath154 the boundary conditions are @xmath178 , thus we write @xmath154=@xmath179 .",
    "clearly the boundary conditions for the perturbations of the field amplitudes are @xmath180 .",
    "one can see that at @xmath181 the r.h.s . of the system ( [ sys_2 ] )",
    "vanishes so one also has @xmath182 .",
    "therefore we used the expansion @xmath183 .",
    "this set of functions is complete but not orthogonal .",
    "we have to truncate these expansions to a finite number of modes .",
    "we have solved the eigenvalue problem numerically to find the neutral surface @xmath184 ( for given angle @xmath1 ) which is defined by the condition @xmath185 .",
    "the number of galerkin modes was chosen such that the accuracy of the calculated eigenvalues was better than @xmath84 ( we took six modes for @xmath154 and forty modes for @xmath186 ) .",
    "the minimum of this surface gives the critical intensity @xmath187=@xmath188 and the critical wavevector @xmath189 .",
    "since @xmath190 turned out to be nonzero at the minimum , the instability corresponds to a hopf bifurcation .",
    "the branch of the secondary hopf instability is depicted as the dash - dotted line in fig .",
    "2a and for small angles of incidence in fig .",
    "2c . it is interesting to note the following tendencies : as the incident angle @xmath1 increases the critical intensity also increases , but the director and field deformations at the secondary instability decrease .",
    "the dimensionless hopf frequency @xmath191 ( @xmath62 is defined in section [ section_lin ] ) versus @xmath61 is shown in fig .",
    "figure 6 shows a typical contour plot of the neutral surface @xmath184 .",
    "the point @xmath192 in this figure is the minimum of the surface and as is seen the bifurcation is inhomogeneous with some critical vector @xmath193 .",
    "this means that travelling waves are expected to appear .",
    "@xmath187 is only slightly below the homogeneous threshold @xmath194 , which was calculated before for the pure lc @xcite .    as was pointed out in section [ st_dist ] , for nonzero @xmath1 there are two symmetry - degenerate stationary distorted states .",
    "clearly the two neutral surfaces are related by changing @xmath157 to @xmath195 and the critical wave vectors will be @xmath189 and @xmath196 .",
    "thus two different travelling waves with critical vectors @xmath197 can be realized depending on which stationary state will be selected after the homeotropic state loses stability .",
    "an interesting situation arises in the limit of normal incidence .",
    "one might expect that for @xmath198 the wavenumber @xmath199 , since in this limit the external symmetry breaking in the @xmath145 direction vanishes . however , this turned out not to be the case .",
    "the reason is that then another stationary instability that spontaneously breaks @xmath145-reflection symmetry intervenes the primary and the hopf bifurcation . for the parameters of our computation one has @xmath200 , @xmath201 ( point a in fig .",
    "2c ) and @xmath202 ( point b in fig .",
    "one now has four symmetry - degenerate states and consequently four traveling waves with critical wave vectors @xmath203 .",
    "= 7.true cm    in some further investigations we have changed the ratios between the elastic constants keeping other material parameters constant and saw the following tendency : the larger the anisotropy of the constants , the deeper the minimum of the surface becomes and the larger the magnitudes of the critical wavenumbers ( see fig .",
    "the absolute error of the dimensionless critical wavenumbers @xmath204 depicted in this figure is less than @xmath205 . in the one - constant approximation",
    "the bifurcation is homogeneous ( @xmath206 ) for any @xmath61 .",
    "this latter can be easily proved analytically .",
    "perturbation theory can be used to investigate @xmath207 dependence of the critical eigenvalue of an arbitrary stationary state .",
    "the calculations shows , that the perturbation of the eigenvalue is @xmath208 .    from fig .",

    "this means that the period of the structure @xmath210 .",
    "thus in an experiment the spot size of the light must be rather large in oder to observe the travelling waves .",
    "= 6.8true cm = 7.true cm    finally we remark on the behaviour of the system in the nonlinear regime above the hopf bifurcation .",
    "this system without transverse degrees of freedom has been studied extensively , and various regimes of complex behaviour have been discovered .",
    "the bifurcation studied in this work marks the transition to simple periodic oscillations in the system without transverse degrees of freedom , which is the first step towards complex behaviour . in models @xcite and simulations @xcite , a gluing bifurcation was found above the secondary hopf instability , which is a homoclinic bifurcation that restores the symmetry broken by the freedericksz transition .",
    "this gluing bifurcation was recently observed experimentaly @xcite . after this first gluing , complex nonlinear behaviour and",
    "eventually chaos was observed in both theory , simulation and experiment @xcite .",
    "an analogous gluing bifurcation should exist also in the case of the spatially extended system .",
    "the behaviour of the system in the vicinity of this gluing bifurcation , can , however be radically different from what was observed in the experiment @xcite . in the spatially constrained system ( i.e. the director oscillation induced by a narrow beam as observed in the experiments ) one observes stochastic behaviour in the vicinity of the first gluing only as a consequence of experimental noise .",
    "it has been shown , however , @xcite that any spatially extended system , which possesses a homogeneous limit cycle ( which is stable with respect to homogeneous perturbations ) becomes unstable as it approaches a homoclinic bifurcation .",
    "this instability is either a phase instability , or a finite - wavelength period - doubling instability . on these grounds",
    "one can expect to observe very complicated behaviour ( probably spatio - temporal chaos ) in our system already at the threshold intensity of the first gluing . as opposed to the previous case",
    ", this would be true deterministic chaos , not merely stochasticity due to noise .",
    "we have found the threshold of the lift for the homeotropic state and the threshold of the secondary instability of the stationary distorted state in a nematic lc , including the dye - doped case , for different incident angles of the light .",
    "in particular we have demonstrated that the stationary distorted state loses stability in an inhomogeneous hopf bifurcation with some nonzero critical wavenumber that leads to the formation of travelling waves in the plane of the layer .",
    "our result demonstrates a general feature of hopf bifurcations in spatially extended systems with broken reflection symmetry , as is the case in the lift - distorted state .",
    "except for special cases , like those where the reflection symmetry can be restored by going into a moving frame , the neutral surface exhibits the signature of the broken symmetry .",
    "consequently , at @xmath211 the neutral surface does not have a stationary point and thus can not have a minimum .",
    "this general feature was apparently first noted in the context of reaction - diffusion systems @xcite .",
