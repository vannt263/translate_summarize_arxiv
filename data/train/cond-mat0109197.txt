    "the sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) model @xcite for ising spins with quenched random bonds is the simplest representative of a class of long - ranged models all describing successfully the interesting phenomena of spin glasses @xcite .",
    "in addition to this success in physical questions , the research on these models has been fruitful and stimulating in optimization problems , in the understanding of neural networks and in the field of learning machines @xcite .",
    "two complimentary but conceptually different approaches exist for the analysis of these models .",
    "the first approach is the replica method applied already by sherrington and kirkpatrick to their model in the original work . after breaking the replica symmetry it was parisi @xcite who first found a satisfactory solution of the sk model in the spin glass regime .    within the replica theory and the related dynamical approaches @xcite",
    ", an averaging over the quenched variables is performed and therefore only the calculation of bond - averaged quantities is possible .",
    "all problems that depend on a special , but arbitrary configuration of the random bonds can not be solved within the framework of the replica theory .",
    "such problems are the generic case in the nonphysical applications named above . in optimization problems , for instance",
    ", the main question is to find the optimal solution for a fixed configuration .",
    "the complimentary approach of thouless - anderson - palmer ( tap ) @xcite to investigate spin glass models does not perform the bond average and permits the treatment of problems depending on specific configurations . for other questions which are expected to be independent of the special configuration , such as all macroscopic physical quantities , self averaging happens .",
    "this is due to the fact that the random interaction matrices have well known asymptotic properties in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "the situation is in principle similar to the central limit theorem in probability theory , where large numbers of random variables also permit the calculation of macroscopic quantities which hold for nearly every realization of the random variables .",
    "thus the investigation of one or some representative systems is sufficient and the bond average is not needed .",
    "the tap equations have been well established for more than two decades and several alternative derivations are known @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the tap approach is still a field of current interest .",
    "this is due to the importance of the approach to numerous interesting problems .",
    "moreover it is suspected that not all aspects of this approach have yet been worked out . very recently",
    "the author @xcite has reanalyzed the stability of the tap equations .",
    "he concluded that the reason for the breakdown at the spin glass instability is an inconsistency in the value of the local susceptibility and showed that unstable states can not be described by the original tap equations . removing these inconsistencies by a self - consistent treatment ,",
    "modified tap equations below the instability have been presented @xcite .",
    "one of the pressing questions is the characteristic features of the pure states of the sk model , which are the stable solutions of the tap equations .",
    "it is obvious that these states are essential for a direct understanding of the sk model .",
    "moreover the pure states are of importance for the interpretation of the more formal results of the replica theory @xcite .    apart from the research @xcite , showing that the number of the pure states is very large at low temperatures , two approaches",
    "exist to investigate the characteristic features of the pure states .",
    "both the work of bray and moore @xcite and the work of nemoto and takayama @xcite try to find explicitly numerical solutions of the tap equations for large but finite systems . only in rare cases ( about 15 % of the systems with different bond configurations )",
    "do these investigations yield solutions of the tap equations which satisfy the validity condition . to treat the other cases nemoto and takayama",
    "have developed an interesting but indirect method to obtain at least approximative solutions which are expected to converge to true solutions in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the applied numerical method of @xcite did not work well for a cooling of the sample and therefore results for this case have not been published .    in this work",
    "we will demonstrate that all the known difficulties to find numerically the pure states disappear if the modified tap equations @xcite are applied instead of the original ones .",
    "for all configurations of the bonds , stable solutions of these tap equations will be found for finite systems employing a simple relaxational dynamics .",
    "there is no further need to apply the indirect method of @xcite and our approach permits the sample to be cooled down , as is shown to be essential to find the low lying states .",
    "in addition to these general goals some characteristic features of pure states will be worked out leading to a better understanding of the sk spin glass .    in section",
    "ii the basics of the modified tap equations , some essentials of the applied dynamics and the numerical procedure are presented .",
    "a main subject of section iii is the investigation of finite size effects which are found to be of some importance .",
    "the numerical results of the state of lowest free energy for the relevant static quantities will be given for all temperatures below the critical spin glass temperature .",
    "next we focus on the meta stable states and discuss some characteristic features .",
    "finally , the concluding remarks can be found in section iv .",
    "the hamiltonian of the sk model of a system of n ising spins ( @xmath0 in the presence of local external fields @xmath1 is described by @xmath2 the bonds @xmath3 are independent random variables with zero means and standard deviations @xmath4 ( where the latter scaling fixes the spin glass temperature to @xmath5 ) .",
    "the modified tap mean field equations @xcite describe the statics of the system ( [ 1 ] ) in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "they are given by the set of equations for the local magnetizations , with @xmath6 @xmath7 together with the local susceptibility @xmath8 and with @xmath9 where @xmath10 and where @xmath11 was introduced .",
    "the condition @xmath12 represents the central spin glass instability condition @xcite . above the instability the local susceptibility @xmath13 reduces to the isothermal value @xmath14 @xmath15 which is in complete agreement with the original tap approach @xcite .",
    "essential differences , however , result below the instability as @xmath16 holds for the modified tap equations . according to @xcite the quantity",
    "@xmath17 is proportional to the density of zero eigenvalues of the inverse susceptibility matrix .",
    "thus all the states with @xmath18 are unstable . as thermodynamics does not apply to unstable states , a conflict with the exact thermodynamic relation @xmath19 does not exist .",
    "as worked out in @xcite the modified tap equations result from the simple fact that the eqs.([4 ] ) together with the definition @xmath20 are complete and sufficient to determine the @xmath21 . from the strict thermodynamic point of view",
    "the modified equations are equivalent to the original tap equations as thermodynamics is a priori limited to stable states .",
    "note , however , that unstable states are essential for discussions based on free energy landscapes or for the extension to dynamics of the present approach . for a further discussion of this point we refer to @xcite and to the end of the next subsection .    for later use",
    "we give the well known expressions @xcite for the energy @xmath22 and the entropy @xmath23 from which the free energy @xmath24 can be calculated . note that these expressions were obtained by thermodynamic approaches .",
    "hence they are restricted to stable states .      as in @xcite ,",
    "glauber dynamics in mean field approximation will phenomenologically be added to the model . measuring the time @xmath25 in units of the relaxation time ,",
    "the purely relaxational equations of motion are given by @xmath26 the local susceptibility @xmath27 is related to the @xmath28 via eq.([7 ] ) and via eq.([8q ] ) or eq.([8neu ] ) depending on the instantaneous value of @xmath29 .",
    "the fixpoints of these equations of motion obviously coincide with the solutions of the modified tap equations .    to analyze the dynamical stability of these fixpoints the equations of motion are linearized near a fixpoint @xmath30 . setting @xmath31 and neglecting as usual the @xmath32 order terms @xmath33",
    ", the linearized equations take in matrix notation the form @xmath34 where @xmath35 represents the static susceptibility matrix for noninteracting ising spins @xmath36 and where @xmath37 is the inverse of the susceptibility matrix of the modified tap approach @xcite . for thermodynamic stable or marginal stable states",
    "@xmath38 is positive semi - definite .    according to eq.([11 ] ) the dynamical stability",
    "is governed the matrix @xmath39 .",
    "let @xmath40 be an eigenvector of @xmath41 satisfying the eigenvalue equation @xmath42 .",
    "multiplication with @xmath43 leads to @xmath44 and to @xmath45 immediately @xmath46 results from the definiteness of @xmath47 and of @xmath38 for stable ( or meta stable ) static states .",
    "static stability therefore implies dynamical stability . by a similar argument ,",
    "the statement can be proven in the opposite direction , leading to a one - to - one correspondence between the two types of stability .",
    "the latter result implies that the stable solutions of the tap equations can be found by integration of the equations of motions ( [ 9 ] ) .",
    "the system relaxes to a stable fixpoint which is certainly located outside the regime @xmath48 . for transient times",
    ", however , the system can enter the regime @xmath49 and thus the flow of eqs.([9 ] ) is needed in both regions @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "these arguments demonstrate the relevance of the unstable states and consequently the need for the modified tap equations for the present approach .",
    "it should be added that equations of motion of the above type but based on the original tap equations usually lead to incorrect results in the spin glass region . for this case",
    "the system generally relaxes to paramagnetic solutions .",
    "the modified tap equations are exact in the thermodynamic limit but are approximative for systems of finite size . as numerical studies",
    "can only be performed for finite systems the two approximations yielding to eqs.([4]-[8neu ] ) for _ finite _ @xmath52 are recalled .",
    "first of all eqs.([4 ] ) holds only to leading order in @xmath53 as sub - extensive contributions have been neglected ( compare e.g. appendix of @xcite ) .",
    "further corrections to eq.([8neu ] ) result from the application @xcite of the pastur theorem @xcite which is again only exact in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the explicit form of these two types of corrections are not known and seem to be hard to determine analytically . hence the finite size effects resulting from the two approximations will be investigated empirically in the numerical section .    due to the sub - extensive corrections the border of stability @xmath54",
    "is expected to be only approximative for finite systems .",
    "this implies that unstable solutions with @xmath55 and stable solutions with @xmath48 may exist for systems of finite size .",
    "such stable solutions with @xmath48 and @xmath56 are indeed found in the following .",
    "finally it is pointed out that the results of subsection b are not restricted to the thermodynamic limit and hold for systems of all sizes .",
    "thus the fixpoints obtained by integration of the eqs.([9 ] ) always correspond to stable solutions of the modified tap equations .",
    "the numerical investigations are performed for systems up to a size of @xmath57 with binary distributions of the bonds @xmath58 using the standard routine ` nintegrate ' of mathematica on workstations .    the integration of the equations of motion ( [ 9 ] ) in the regime @xmath51 is straightforward . in the region @xmath50 , however , a special procedure is employed and @xmath59 is treated as additional dynamical variable .",
    "the time derivative of eq.([8neu ] ) yields the necessary additional equation of motion and the initial value of @xmath59 is determined from eqs.([8neu ] ) for @xmath60 which finally guaranties that eq.([8neu ] ) is satisfied for all times .    during the dynamic evolution @xmath29",
    "generally changes sign , which implies a change of the numerical treatment .",
    "therefore an alternative , approximative approach is partly applied . instead of eq.([8neu ] ) the equation @xmath61 is used , where @xmath62 is a small positive constant with typical values from @xmath63 to @xmath64 . with the supplementary term @xmath65 eq.([18 ] )",
    "has a solution @xmath66 for all values of of @xmath67 . due to the smallness of @xmath62 only small differences",
    "occur in comparison with the exact values of @xmath17 , which are @xmath68 for @xmath55 or which , for the case @xmath48 , are determined by eq.([8neu ] ) .",
    "hence the set of eqs.([9]),([7 ] ) and ( [ 18 ] ) can be used for all values of @xmath29 leading to an unified treatment of the cases @xmath48 and @xmath55 .",

    "however approaching a limiting temperature by slow temperature changes , the system always bifurcates into a branch which has a lower free energy , implying hysteresis effects in some cases .",
    "although such results are physically expected this behavior is numerically verified for all states plotted in fig.[fig : f12 ] .",
    "note that in the whole temperature range most of the meta stable states have negligible boltzmann weights .",
    "actually only the three lowest states of sample i will give non negligible contributions to boltzmann averaged quantities .",
    "nevertheless the system will remain dynamically in a meta stable state of high free energy for all times provided it remains there initially and provided no drastic changes of the temperature or the magnetic field are performed .    according to fig.[fig : f12 ] the free energy levels sometimes cross with changes of the temperature .",
    "even the state of lowest free energy can be involved , which implies that the state of lowest free energy and the first exited state change their roles at the crossing temperature .",
    "thus in the notation of this work , to call the state slowly cooled from @xmath5 the state of lowest free energy is not strictly correct .",
    "for brevity we will still use this term keeping , however , the limitations in mind .      in this subsection",
    "the discontinuities are analyzed which arise in the temperature dependence of states of lowest free energy and of the meta stable states .",
    "for this purpose the eigenvalues @xmath188 and the eigenvectors @xmath189 of the inverse susceptibility ( [ 13 ] ) @xmath190 are introduced for an arbitrary solution @xmath21 at the temperature @xmath134 . approaching a discontinuity the smallest eigenvalue @xmath191 tends to zero and vanishes at a critical temperature @xmath192 . in fig.[fig : s ] an example is presented where the temperature dependence of @xmath193 is given by the numerical solutions of eq.([40 ] ) .    for further discussions the staggered magnetizations @xmath194 are defined @xmath195 the numerical results for @xmath196 and @xmath197 are plotted in fig.[fig : s ] for a discontinuity . within the numerical errors @xmath198 and @xmath199 hold where the latter result is representative for all @xmath200 .",
    "* saddle node bifurcation : * smallest eigenvalue @xmath201 ( dotted line ) , critical staggered magnetization @xmath196 ( full line ) and an uncritical staggered magnetization @xmath197 ( dashed line ) versus temperature @xmath134 near the discontinuity at @xmath202 of fig.[fig : f12 ] .",
    "the dashed dotted line shows the leading behavior @xmath203 near @xmath204.,height=264 ]    these temperature variations can analytically be explained .",
    "for such an approach eq.([4 ] ) is rewritten as @xmath205 and expanded at @xmath192 to first order in @xmath206 and to second order in @xmath207 which yields @xmath208 with @xmath209 multiplying eq.([43 ] ) from the left by the eigenvectors @xmath210 the @xmath211 are calculated to @xmath212 and to @xmath213 where @xmath214 and @xmath215 the analytic results ( [ 45 ] ) and ( [ 45 ] ) agree with temperature dependence found numerically and plotted in fig.[fig : s ] .",
    "moreover these results exhibit all the typical features of a saddle - node bifurcation .",
    "the two branches exist only for @xmath216 or for @xmath217 depending on the signs of @xmath218 and of @xmath219 .",
    "provided the branches exist one of them is stable and the other is unstable @xcite .",
    "the staggered magnetizations @xmath220 govern the behaviors of the states near the critical temperatures .",
    "thus the @xmath221 _ are the order parameters of the local saddle node bifurcations_.     * free energy landscape : * free energy density @xmath222 versus distance @xmath223 from the critical magnetization in direction of @xmath224 for temperatures above and below the critical temperature @xmath225 ( compare text ) .",
    "shown is the heating process of sample iii for the state of lowest free energy .",
    "the stable solutions are indicated by dots .",
    "the full and the dashed lines correspond to the regimes @xmath55 and @xmath48 , respectively.,height=245 ]    further numerical evidence for such bifurcations is presented in fig.[fig : a4 ] where the discontinuity of sample iii at @xmath226 for the heating process is considered . in this figure",
    "the temperature variation of the free energy landscape is investigated by plotting the quantity @xmath227 below a critical temperature a minimum of the free energy and hence a stable solution exists in the region @xmath228 which disappears by a saddle - node bifurcation above the critical temperature .",
    "note that the stationary values of @xmath223 determine approximately the temperature dependence of @xmath229 near @xmath204 .    a further interesting detail",
    "is contained in fig.[fig : a4 ] .",
    "below the critical temperature @xmath230 is not semi - convex everywhere for @xmath228 , but above the critical temperature @xmath231 is convex even in some regime @xmath18 .",
    "this demonstrates explicitly that the border of stability @xmath112 is only approximative for finite systems .",
    "in this work we have demonstrated that the modified tap equations are an adequate tool for exploring the characteristics of the pure states of the sk model of finite sizes .",
    "for all realizations of the random bonds explicit solutions exhibiting the spin glass features are obtained . moreover ,",
    "the present approach makes it possible to analyze the temperature dependence of all quantities of physical interest .",
    "in contrast to other approaches the method presented can simulate a slow cooling of the system , which is of particular importance to find the features of the low lying states .",
    "apart from these properties for the state of lowest free energy we have found some interesting statistical features of the meta stable states which seems to be generic for every sample and in the author s opinion , it is a challenge to find an analytical approach to these features .",
    "the present work uses a relaxational dynamics as a mathematical tool to find the pure states as fixpoints of the equations of motion . recall that the origin of this dynamics is phenomenological and thus true dynamic effects can not be described by the present approach .",
    "thus the complete dynamical description should be a subject of further research .",
