    "a network may undergo a phase transition as one discards nodes or links successively . when the fraction of remaining nodes or links is greater than a threshold , the network possesses a giant cluster which consists of a finite fraction of interconnected nodes . in the opposite case",
    "the giant cluster disappears and all nodes disintegrate into small clusters .",
    "it is called the percolation phase transition that separates the two phases .",
    "the percolation transition in complex networks , as well as in regular lattices  , is interesting because of its relevance to robustness of network systems against random failure and epidemic spreading  @xcite .",
    "the random network of erds and rnyi  ( er ) is a prototypical model for complex networks  ( see ref .",

    "an er network with @xmath0 nodes is constructed by linking each pair of nodes with the probability @xmath1 $ ] , or by adding @xmath2 links between randomly selected pairs of nodes .",
    "the link density is given by @xmath3 , and the degree distribution follows the poisson distribution @xmath4 with the mean degree @xmath5 .",
    "the er network is _ uncorrelated _ in the sense that it lacks any structural correlation .",
    "this property allows one to study the percolation transition analytically .",
    "we summarize some known results : ( i )  the percolation order parameter @xmath6 is defined as the probability that a node belongs to a giant cluster .",
    "it exhibits a threshold behavior with the power - law scaling @xmath7 for @xmath8 with the exponent @xmath9 .",
    "( ii )  let @xmath10 be the number of clusters of size @xmath11 per node .",

    "recently the percolation transition in a class of growing networks draws interest  @xcite .",
    "the common feature of these networks is that the numbers of nodes and links are increasing in time with the density of links @xmath3 fixed . adding a node and making a link corresponds to nucleation of a cluster and merging of clusters , respectively .",
    "as one varies @xmath3 , finite clusters condense into a giant cluster giving rise to the percolation transition  @xcite .",

    "similarly one may ask a question whether the essential singularity is observed in a non - growing network .    there is an important observation that the growing networks  @xcite have a positive degree - degree correlation . a positive degree - degree correlation , or phrased as an assortative mixing , refers to the tendency toward making links between nodes of similar degrees  @xcite . consider a pair of connected nodes in a growing network . as a network grows , the two nodes acquire more and more links generating a positive correlation . on the other hand , those networks displaying the power - law type percolation transition do not have any degree correlation .",
    "it gives a hint that the degree correlation may be an important factor determining the universality class . in this work",
    ", we will investigate the effect of the degree correlation on the nature of the percolation transition .",
    "the degree correlation of a network can be quantified by the assortativity  @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the average over all links and @xmath30 denotes the degrees of two nodes at either end of links .",

    "<S> we introduce an exponential random graph model for networks with a fixed degree distribution and with a tunable degree - degree correlation . </S>",
    "<S> we then investigate the nature of a percolation transition in the correlated network with the poisson degree distribution . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that negative correlation is irrelevant in that the percolation transition in the disassortative network belongs to the same universality class of the uncorrelated network . </S>",
    "<S> positive correlation turns out to be relevant . </S>",
    "<S> the percolation transition in the assortative network is characterized by the non - diverging mean size of finite clusters and power - law scalings of the density of the largest cluster and the cluster size distribution in the non - percolating phase as well as at the critical point . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that the unusual type percolation transition in the growing network models reported recently may be inherited from the assortative degree - degree correlation . </S>"
