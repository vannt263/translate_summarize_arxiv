    "at zero temperature , @xmath14 and the chain perfectly transfers information ; at higher temperature the capacity goes down as @xmath15 , where @xmath1 is the strength of the ising coupling .",
    "therefore , thermal fluctuations limits the maximum length of the chain for reliable information transfer to @xmath16 .",
    "quantum systems enable new forms of information processing which exploit peculiar quantum features such as superposition and entanglement . indeed the quantum ( spin ) states are not described anymore by a binary value , but rather by a @xmath194 density matrix which encodes much more information . in our calculation for simplicity we used the capacity of a _ classical _ channel : even though our channel is physically implemented with quantum objects , both our inputs and outputs are binary values .",
    "on the other hand , in the general formalism , both input and output states are described by a quantum density matrix . to send classical information , namely a collection of binary inputs , the two input states , 0 and 1 ,",

    "when multiple uses of the channel are considered , then @xmath199 provides a lower bound to the capacity @xcite .",
    "the capacity @xmath199 is more complicated to measure than eq . because requires a full state tomography of the output state to determine all of the components of the density matrix .",
    "moreover , it requires also an optimization over the initial encoding of the bits into two states @xmath198 .    in order to compute @xmath199 and to compare it with @xmath11 we make some simplifications .",
    "first we assume that @xmath195 and @xmath196 , namely the states of the island , can only be initialized in either up or down along the @xmath25 direction , as discussed in the main text .",
    "secondly , we consider the effective description of table [ tab : hameff ] . in this effective spin-1/2 system",

    "therefore , when @xmath214 , a quantum state encoding and decoding can enhance the capacity of the channel , but it can not turn a broken channel into a non - broken one ( @xmath215 whenever @xmath216 ) .",
    "the appearance of the effective transverse field @xmath48 can be explained in terms of the level structure . for spin 1 systems , when @xmath217 the states @xmath218 are degenerate while @xmath219 has a higher energy ( the difference being @xmath220 ) .",
    "the transverse anisotropy couples the states @xmath218 with an energy @xmath221 without affecting @xmath219 . on the other hand",
    ", a field in the @xmath222-plane enables an effective coupling @xmath223 between the states @xmath218 mediated by a two - step transition through the virtual population of @xmath219 . in the limit @xmath224 , this results in an effective global planar field shown in table [ tab : hameff ] .",
    "in the main text , we focus on antiferromagnetic ( afm ) heisenberg coupling between the spins of an atomic chain .",
    "however , since ferromagnetic ( fm ) coupling is also possible in atomic systems @xcite , we consider those results as well . for dmrg calculations , we simply use @xmath225 rather than @xmath27 ; in the effective model shown in table [ tab : hameff ] , @xmath226 . as seen in supplementary fig .",
    "[ fig : fluctuationsfmafm ] , small differences in the capacity are seen between fm and afm chains when @xmath5 is small , though these become negligible as @xmath5 increases .",
    "additional small deviations in the capacity are seen between fm and afm chains in the presence of a magnetic field ( supplementary fig .",
    "[ fig : fieldfmafm ] ) , though the qualitative behaviour remains the same in both cases .",
    "furthermore , although fm systems generally have a higher capacity than their afm counterparts , this capacity is highly sensitive to external fields in the @xmath25-direction .",
    "the effects of this sensitivity are shown in the inset of supplementary fig .",
    "[ fig : fieldfmafm]b , where it is clear that a small field @xmath227 overcomes the effect of the magnetic islands for fm systems , while afm chains are more stable against this perturbation .",
    "as discussed via the effective ising model , maximal capacity corresponds to @xmath77 where the ising chain has a degenerate ground state .",
    "the appearance of such degeneracy can be understood ( at least to the leading order in the @xmath228 expansion ) at the single spin level in terms of ss - qst and diabolic points @xcite .",
    "indeed , the single - spin curves which define the `` diabolic points '' almost completely match the curves of maximal capacity , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : capvsgap ] . such relationship between high - capacity and ( almost ) degenerate ground states is extended to the many - body case in fig .",
    "[ fig : capvsgap ] where one can see that the regions of high - capacity are in one - to - one correspondence to the regions where the energy difference between the many - body ground state and the first excited state is small .",
    "to explain this fact let us consider again the ising effective description .",
    "as shown in the main text , non - zero capacity corresponds to the ordered phase @xmath57 .",
    "this phase in the thermodynamic limit is characterized by two degenerate ground states , while for finite chains there is a finite energy splitting between a unique ground state and the first excited state which goes to zero in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "therefore , unlike the single - spin case where degeneracy occurs only at specific discrete values of @xmath89 , in a chain the degeneracy occurs in a whole region .",
    "for instance in spin 1 chains the ordered region @xmath229 corresponds to @xmath230 , when @xmath231 , and so it can be expanded with a larger @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : capvsgap ] , this relationship between quasi - degeneracy and high - capacity is more general than the effective ising description as it holds also when @xmath89 and @xmath232 are comparable with @xmath98 where the perturbative effective ising model becomes less accurate ."
