    "there has recently been a great deal of work on deterministic dynamical systems possessing invariant submanifolds , motivated by symmetric systems , and in particular some coupled systems . such systems have been shown to be capable of producing a range of interesting and robust dynamical modes of behaviour , such as _ riddled basins _ @xcite and _ on - off intermittency _ @xcite , shown to be related by the _ blowout bifurcation _",
    "@xcite , as well as _",
    "transient on - off intermittency _ @xcite .",
    "we denote the manifold on which such a system is defined by @xmath0 and the corresponding invariant submanifold by @xmath1 .",
    "an attractor is said to have a riddled basin if every open set intersecting the basin also intersects the basin of another attractor in a set of positive measure ; such basins can arise robustly for milnor attractors @xcite contained in @xmath1 .",
    "on - off intermittency to a state in @xmath1 is characterised by dynamics that comes arbitrarily close to the state in @xmath1 but that also has intermittent large deviations from @xmath1 .",
    "transient on - off intermittency is a transient dynamics exhibiting characteristics of on  off intermittent behaviour .",
    "namely , it has an average distribution of laminar phases that satisfies a power law with exponent @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "all these phenomena arise as different aspects of blowout bifurcations , where a maximum normal lyapunov exponent of an attractor in @xmath1 passes through zero and thus causes a loss of stability . to date , most mathematical understanding of such systems is limited to cases where there are a number of simplifying assumptions :    * the control parameters are assumed to be _ normal _ @xcite , in the sense that the dynamics of the invariant submanifold is independent of the bifurcation parameter . such parameters",
    "preserve the dynamics on the invariant submanifold , but allow it to vary in the rest of the phase space ; * the attractor which becomes transversely unstable in the @xmath1 and hence causes the blowout bifurcation is usually assumed to be chaotic .",
    "( note however that @xcite find blowout type bifurcations from quasiperiodic dynamics on @xmath3 . )",
    "as many physical systems of interest are unlikely to possess normal parameters ( a notable exception to this being some coupled systems ) , we expect that ( h1 ) is not usually applicable .",
    "this is particularly expected to be true in truncations of partial differential equations that arise in fluid and dynamo equations ( as well as astrophysical models in general ) .",
    "thus , by studying the behaviour of a specific example where ( h1 ) does not hold , we hope we throw some light on the dynamics of general systems of this type .    to this end",
    "we examine a system where ( h1 ) does not hold , i.e.  where the control parameter varies the dynamics within the invariant subspace as well as that normal to it .",
    "we see that this has the effect of ` spreading ' the blowout bifurcation out over an interval of parameter values due to the existence of periodic windows where ( h2 ) does not hold ; however , we conjecture that there is a positive measure subset of parameters on which the blowout resembles the case for normal parameters .",
    "the model we describe in section  ii arises as the truncation of a stellar axisymmetric mean field dynamo model where the natural control parameters are not normal .",
    "there is also more than one invariant manifold forced by the spatial symmetries of the system , although this does not appear to affect the behaviour in the cases examined , in the sense that it is only one of these manifolds , namely the antisymmetric one , which seems to dominate the attracting dynamics .    in section",
    "iii we discuss numerical results from simulations of the model ; we discuss the basic bifurcational behaviour in the full system and the antisymmetric subspace before discussing examples of type i intermittency , transient on  off intermittency and non - normal parameter blowout bifurcation in the model . in the final section  iv the implications of the results",
    "are discussed for more general systems of this type as well as for the dynamo problem .",
    "the dynamo model considered here is the so called @xmath4 mean field dynamo model , with a dynamic @xmath5effect , given by schmalz & stix @xcite ( see also covas et al .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "we assume a spherical axisymmetrical configuration with one spatial dimension @xmath6 ( corresponding to the latitude and measured in terms of the stellar radius @xmath7 ) for which the magnetic field takes the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the @xmath10component ( latitudinal ) of the magnetic vector potential and @xmath11 is the @xmath10component of @xmath12 .",
    "the model is given by the mean field induction equation @xmath13 where @xmath12 is the mean magnetic field , @xmath14 is the mean velocity , @xmath15 is the turbulent magnetic diffusitivity and @xmath5 is the coefficient of the @xmath5effect @xcite . in addition",
    "the @xmath5effect , which is important in maintaining the dynamo action by relating the mean electrical current arising in helical turbulence to the mean magnetic field , is assumed to be dynamic and expressible in the form @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a constant and @xmath18 is its dynamic part satisfying the equation @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a physical constant , @xmath21 is the electrical current and @xmath22 is the turbulent diffusivity .",
    "these assumptions allow eq .",
    "( [ induction ] ) to be split into the following two equations : @xmath23 expressing these equations in a non - dimensional form , relabelling the new variables to @xmath24 and using a spectral expansion of the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 determines the truncation order , reduces equations ( [ dynamicalpha])([p2 ] ) to a set of ordinary differential equations , the dimension of which depends on the truncation order @xmath26 .",
    "we consider the full system given in terms of the variables @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 in the form @xmath31 where @xmath32 if @xmath33 is odd and @xmath34 otherwise , @xmath35 if @xmath33 is odd and @xmath36 otherwise and @xmath37 if @xmath38 is odd and @xmath39 otherwise . in these equations",
    "the control parameters are the so called dynamo number @xmath40 ( which is proportional to the square of the angular velocity gradient and to the square of the turnover time of the turbulent convection eddies ) and the diffusivity ratio @xmath41 .",
    "covas et al .  @xcite confined themselves to the study of models that are antisymmetric with respect to the equator and found that the minimum truncation order @xmath26 for which a similar asymptotic behaviour existed was @xmath42 . in this case , the equations have a twelve dimensional phase space and are symmetric under the four - element abelian group that comprises the identity @xmath43 , the reversal transformation @xmath44 the antisymmetric ( or dipolar ) transformations @xmath45 and the symmetric ( or quadrupolar ) transformations @xmath46 the trivial solution , given by @xmath47 , is the only one which possesses both the dipolar and quadrupolar symmetries while symmetric solutions come in pairs and asymmetric solutions come in quadruples .",
    "the antisymmetric part of these equations , which is obtained by putting @xmath48 , was studied in @xcite .",
    "we refer to this dynamically invariant subspace @xmath49 as the antisymmetric subspace .",
    "there is also a six dimensional symmetric invariant subspace @xmath50 although as we will see , the attractors are typically not contained within @xmath51 . throughout the paper we refer to the full system as the 12  dimensional system .",
    "the system considered here has a two dimensional parameter space @xmath52 , neither of which is normal for the system restricted to @xmath53 , as can be seen from equations ( [ main3_1])-([main3_3 ] ) .",
    "we confine @xmath54 to the range @xmath55 $ ] on physical grounds , as otherwise there will be no dynamo action .",
    "previous studies of these models have taken @xmath56 . here",
    "we shall consider two distinct cases of @xmath54 given by @xmath57 and @xmath58 in this range and in each case allow @xmath40 to vary . to study the dynamics of this system ,",
    "we start by looking at the dynamics on the antisymmetric invariant submanifold @xmath53 and then look at how this changes as the full system is switched on .      to begin with , we consider the case of @xmath59 and as a first step make a coarse study of the dynamics confined to @xmath53 as well as the full ( 12dimensional ) system by considering the averaged energy ( @xmath60 ) as a function of the parameter @xmath40 .",
    "the results of these calculations are summarised in figs.([bifurcation_anti ] ) and ( [ bifurcation_mixed ] ) respectively .",
    "the figures were produced using a fourth order variable step size runge - kutta method to integrate a number of randomly selected initial conditions forward in time , and so get a selection of the possible attractors . after a time when transients were deemed to have decayed ( which we took to be 1000 time units ) we averaged the energy over a much longer time series",
    "i.e.  10000 time units .",
    "we have verified the following results using the continuation package auto97 @xcite .    for small @xmath40 ( @xmath61 )",
    "all attracting dynamics of the full 12dimensional system is confined to the 6dimensional antisymmetric invariant submanifold @xmath53 .",
    "the details of bifurcations are depicted in figs .",
    "( [ bifurcation_anti ] ) and ( [ bifurcation_mixed ] ) . as can be seen from these figures , as @xmath40 is increased , the fixed point at the origin ( the trivial solution for both systems ) bifurcates at @xmath62 to two fixed points , which are symmetric with respect to @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "a subcritical pitchfork - type bifurcation stabilises the origin from @xmath66 up to a supercritical hopf bifurcation at @xmath67 .    for larger values of @xmath40 the two systems will evolve differently .",
    "in @xmath53 the supercritical hopf bifurcation creates a stable periodic solution while the 12dimensional system evolves on a branch of stable periodic solution with quadrupolar symmetry that becomes unstable through a torus bifurcation at @xmath68 .",
    "in addition to this , at @xmath69 , the origin undergoes hopf bifurcation creating a branch of dipolar periodic solutions that are stabilised by a torus bifurcation at @xmath70 , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "( [ bifurcation_mixed ] ) . also shown in the inset is the appearance through a saddle - node bifurcation of a branch of periodic solutions in @xmath51 at @xmath71 that are stable up to @xmath72 .",
    "here they lose stability at a torus bifurcation .",
    "all of these branches of solutions pass through the region from @xmath73 to @xmath74 without bifurcation ; however they do not provide a complete picture of all that happens in this region .",
    "there is a pair of periodic orbits in @xmath53 that are created at a saddle - node bifurcation at @xmath75 .",
    "these are stabilised by a pitchfork bifurcation of periodic orbits at @xmath76 creating a branch of stable periodic orbits with no symmetry continuing down to @xmath77 ; these are important for the intermittent dynamics discussed in the next subsection ( fig .",
    "[ typei.bifurcation ] ) . for larger @xmath40 ,",
    "the periodic orbit undergoes a sequence of bifurcations preserving the dipolar symmetry ( i.e.  creating branches that remain within @xmath53 ) up until @xmath78 where a branch of stable periodic orbits that bifurcate from @xmath53 is created .",
    "we conjecture that the saddle node bifurcation creating this series of periodic orbits is associated with breakdown of a quasiperiodic flow on a two - torus created at one of the torus bifurcations but have not been able to check this .",
    "we investigated two cases ; @xmath59 and @xmath79 .",
    "note that for physically meaningful results we require @xmath80 .",
    "we have examined the transverse stability of attractors in @xmath53 by calculating the corresponding transverse lyapunov exponent ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "[ transverse_nu_0.50 ] summarises the results of calculations of the @xmath81 for the periodic orbit which is created at @xmath75 , as shown in the inset in fig .",
    "( [ bifurcation_anti ] ) .",
    "the important feature in this behaviour of @xmath81 is the presence of the two crossings through zero .",
    "the transverse stability of the other attractors do not change in this range of @xmath40 .      for the case @xmath59 we examined the behaviour of the full system over a parameter interval in the neighbourhood of @xmath82 .",
    "the loss of stability of the periodic orbit described in the previous section , does not induce on - off intermittency as we first suspected . instead , the bifurcation at @xmath76 is a pitchfork bifurcation that creates an asymmetric periodic orbit which survives up to @xmath77 and is then destroyed by a collision with an unstable orbit in a saddle node bifurcation , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ typei.bifurcation ] .    for @xmath83",
    ", we have a transient type - i intermittency , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ series_nu=0.50 ] .",
    "we also calculated the scalings of the transient times and average times between the bursts ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ transients_nu=0.50 ] and fig .",
    "[ bursts_nu=0.50 ] ) and found them to be in good agreement with the known @xmath84 scaling .",
    "the behaviour between bursts shown in fig .",
    "[ series_nu=0.50 ] , resembles the 12d periodic orbit discussed above , except that the amplitude of the symmetric part of the oscillations between the bursts grow slowly towards the bursts and return , after the bursts , close to the invariant submanifold .",
    "the intermittent behaviour is transient , in the sense that the orbit returns to the fixed point in the invariant submanifold .",
    "the spectrum of lyapunov exponents for these transient forms of intermittency is in the form @xmath85 , until the transient dies out , becoming attracted to a stable fixed point ( note : there are two such fixed points , located symmetrically with respect to the a and b variables ) .    on the negative side of the crossing of the transverse lyapunov exponent , shown in fig .",
    "[ transverse_nu_0.50 ] , we observe a basin boundary for the full 12dimensional system with a dimension close to that of the phase space .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ false_riddled ] which demonstrates which asymptotic attractor on the invariant submanifold the initial conditions get attracted to .",
    "both basins seem to be made up of open sets ( supported by the fact that calculations indicate an integer box counting dimension ) .",
    "this conclusion is further supported by the calculation of the exterior dimension @xcite shown in fig .  [ exterior ] .",
    "it is also interesting to note , from both physical and mathematical points of view , that even if the full ( 12dimensional ) system does have any new attractors , nevertheless it will in general alter the relative size of the basins of attraction ; most initial points seem to get attracted to only the fixed points or one of the cycles , as opposed to initial conditions starting in the invariant sub - manifold .      by making @xmath54 slightly smaller than @xmath57",
    "we were able to change the order of the bifurcation to chaos in the invariant submanifold relative to the loss of transverse stability .",
    "to study the behaviour of the system with @xmath79 , we looked at the parameter region in which the system with @xmath56 had a chaotic attractor ( as depicted in fig.[transverse_nu_0.50 ] ) . for our calculations",
    ", we chose our initial conditions to lie in the basin of the chaotic attractors for @xmath56 system .",
    "we then studied the evolution of the system for @xmath79 by changing the control parameter and taking the initial conditions at each step to lie in the basin of the attractor for the previous parameter value .",
    "the results of these calculations for the @xmath81 and the largest lyapunov exponents of the full 12dimensional system are given in fig .",
    "[ transverse_nu_0.47 ] and fig .",
    "[ amplify ] .",
    "as can be seen , the chaotic behaviour is now interspersed with periodic windows . within these windows the periodic solutions co",
    "- exist with chaotic repellers .",
    "another crossing of the transverse lyapunov exponent , from negative to positive , shown in fig .",
    "[ transverse_nu_0.50 ] , occurs at @xmath86 , and for @xmath87 there are stable periodic orbits restricted to the invariant submanifold .",
    "this crossing is also related to a bifurcation of periodic orbits and therefore there is no indication of on - off intermittency or riddled basins .",
    "the periodic orbit on the invariant submanifold becomes chaotic just after @xmath88 , not close enough to the transverse stability bifurcation at @xmath89 to induce on - off intermittency .",
    "this suggests that there is likely to be a blowout at nearby parameters in the two parameter space , as we discuss in the next section . to substantiate this , we calculated the scaling of the probability distribution of the off phases ( corresponding to when the distance to the invariant submanifold is less than @xmath90 ) as a function of their length .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ laminar ] , the scaling agrees with the power law behaviour proposed in @xcite with an index of @xmath2 . at this parameter value transient on -",
    "off trajectories appear to be induced by a chaotic invariant set that is a repeller within the invariant submanifold .",
    "there are a number of interesting dynamical phenomena that occur here , that are related to the fact that the system parameters are not normal .",
    "+ ( i ) the chaotic behaviour in the invariant submanifold appears to be of the non - uniformly hyperbolic variety , and in particular the chaotic attractors are not structurally stable ; they are destroyed by arbitrarily small perturbations . notwithstanding this",
    ", we find numerical evidence ( fig .",
    "[ transverse_nu_0.47 ] and fig .",
    "[ amplify ] ) that there is a family of chaotic attractors with similar properties defined on a _ subset _ of parameter space with positive ( lebesgue ) measure but open ( even dense ) complement .",
    "this is what is found , for example , in the logistic map @xcite . in the open dense complement",
    "we expect to see periodic windows and many bifurcations , for example period doubling cascades , which we have found numerically .",
    "this is consistent with the conjecture of barreto et al .",
    "@xcite on noting that the attractors here have only one positive lyapunov exponent . in this parameter region",
    "the system may be said to be fragile @xcite , in the sense that arbitrarily small changes in the control parameter @xmath40 can force a chaotic attractor to be replaced by a nearly attracting periodic orbit .",
    "\\(ii ) in the light of ( i ) , there is no reason why there should be a unique parameter value @xmath91 at which blowout occurs . in particular ,",
    "the attractor in @xmath53 varies discontinuously , and its tangential and normal lyapunov exponents vary discontinuously with @xmath40 except within the periodic windows .",
    "this explains the presence of smooth segments in the curves of fig.[amplify ] within regions where the attracting dynamics is periodic .",
    "\\(iii ) in this system the passage of @xmath81 through zero is fairly simple .",
    "firstly , the value of @xmath81 can be bracketed between upper and lower bounds that also pass through zero .",
    "this is presumably due to the fact that certain periodic orbits in the attractor will typically maximise and minimise transverse lyapunov exponents @xcite .",
    "secondly , there is evidence that there is a positive measure cantor set @xmath92 in parameter space where chaotic behaviour exists . on @xmath92",
    "the lyapunov exponents are continuous in the sense that there is a continuous function @xmath93 of parameter that is equal to @xmath81 on @xmath92 and passes through zero at about @xmath78 ( see fig .",
    "[ transverse_nu_0.47 ] and also fig.[average ] ) . even for parameter values not in @xmath92 we can get transient on - off intermittent behaviour ( see fig.[series_nu=0.47 ] ) .",
    "+ on the basis of our results we conjecture that properties ( i)-(ii ) are typical behaviour at blowout on varying a non - normal parameter and ( iii ) is a typical simple scenario of how this can occur .    for the case @xmath79",
    "we note that the transverse lyapunov exponent ( of the chaotic invariant set that attracts within @xmath53 ) becomes positive and causes the appearance of transient on - off intermittency .",
    "we have studied global dynamics and bifurcations occurring in a 12dimensional truncation of a stellar mean field dynamo model which possesses two six dimensional invariant submanifolds corresponding to dipolar and quadrupolar symmetries respectively .",
    "an essential feature of this model is that its control parameters are non - normal , allowing the dynamics to vary both within the invariant submanifolds as well as in the directions normal to them .",
    "depending upon the region of the parameter space considered , we find a diverse set of dynamical modes of behaviour , including different forms of intermittency .",
    "in addition to transient type i intermittency , we find transient on - off intermittency induced by blowout bifurcations . in the parameter range where we observe the latter behaviour , the invariant submanifold possesses a family of chaotic attractors on a subset of parameter space with positive ( lebesgue ) measure but open ( even dense ) complement .",
    "on the basis of our numerical calculations these attractors seem to be structurally unstable , which is consistent with the conjecture of barreto et al .",
    "we also find that as a consequence of the non - normality of the control parameters the blowout bifurcation seems to occur over an interval rather than a point in the parameter space .",
    "these results can be of potential significance for the dynamical behaviour of systems with non - normal parameters . given the fact that the model considered here was derived directly from dynamo equations , the forms of intermittency found here can also be of potential importance in understanding the mechanism of production of the so - called grand or maunder - type minima in solar and stellar activity , during which the amplitudes of stellar cycles are greatly diminished @xcite .",
