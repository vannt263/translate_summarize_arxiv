    "stars with initial mass in the range 0.88 m@xmath6 go through an asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase towards the end of their evolution .",
    "this evolutionary phase is dominated by strong mass loss .",
    "the star expels material at rates up to @xmath9yr@xmath7 , eventually ejecting between 20 and 80 per cent of its initial main - sequence mass .",
    "this process is of great importance for the chemical evolution of our galaxy .",
    "mass loss from agb stars contributes to around half of the gas recycled by stars ( maeder 1992 ) , and is a dominant source of galactic dust .",
    "the mass - loss mechanism of agb stars is a two - step process .",
    "first , shocks due to pulsations from the star produce gas over - densities in an extended atmosphere ( e.g. hfner et al . 1998 ) .",
    "this triggers the formation of dust .",
    "secondly , radiation pressure accelerates the dust to the escape velocity .",
    "the gas is carried along through friction with the dust particles .",
    "pulsations alone can explain mass - loss rates up to about @xmath10yr@xmath7 , but the much higher rates observed require dust - driven winds ( bowen &  wilson 1991 ) .    the importance of metallicity on the mass - loss rates of agb stars is not well understood . in low metallicity environments",
    "less dust is expected to form , leading to lower predicted mass - loss rates",
    ". theoretical work by bowen & willson ( 1991 ) predicts that for metallicities below [ fe / h]@xmath11 dust - driven winds fail , and the wind becomes pulsation - driven .",
    "this would affect the evolution of a low metallicity host galaxy in two obvious ways . first the stellar dust production would be much reduced and therefore the composition of the material out of which new stars and planets were forming would be significantly different . secondly the much weaker dust - driven winds allow the degenerate core of the agb star to grow for longer , resulting in much higher masses for the remnant white dwarfs . in extreme cases ,",
    "the core could reach the chandrasekhar limit before mass loss terminates its evolution .",
    "the bowen &  willson mass - loss rates predict the occurrence of agb supernovae at very low metallicities ( zijlstra 2004 ) .",
    "it is therefore important to test whether dust - driven winds exist at low metallicity .",
    "observations in the magellanic clouds and the galaxy have shown that the dust mass - loss rates are smaller in the magellanic clouds .",
    "assuming that the dust - to - gas ratio is a linear function of metallicity ( [ fe / h]=@xmath12 ( venn 1999 ) and [ fe / h]=@xmath13 for the small and large magellanic clouds respectively ) yields the conclusion that the total mass - loss rate ( dust+gas ) may be similar in the three galaxies ( van loon 2000 , 2006 ) , although this assumption may not be strictly correct , as the dust in the carbon stars comes from primary carbon . in order to obtain further constraints on the effect of metallicity on the mass - loss rates from agb stars , and to know",
    "if dust - driven mass loss can occur at very low metallicities , we need to study the mass - loss rates from more metal - poor agb stars .",
    "the dusty circumstellar envelopes surrounding these agb stars absorb the radiation from the central star and re - emit it in the thermal infrared .",
    "observations at infrared wavelengths have enabled the study of mass - loss from galactic and magellanic clouds agb stars .",
    "thanks to the sensitivity achievable with mid - infrared instruments on 8 m class ground - based telescopes , it is now possible to perform such studies for agb stars in more distant local group galaxies .",
    "we thus observed agb stars in the fornax dsph ( fornax ) and sagittarius ( sgr dsph ) dwarf spheroidal galaxies using the mid - infrared camera visir on the vlt ( eso , chile ) .",
    "fornax is a satellite galaxy of the milky way , at a distance of @xmath14 138 kpc .",
    "sgr dsph is located behind the galactic disc and bulge at a distance of @xmath1424 kpc .",
    "it is currently being torn apart by tidal forces ( majewski et al .",
    "those galaxies have low metallicities ( see section 2 ) .",

    "squares represent the sgr dsph stars and triangles the fornax stars .",
    "circles show the stellar population of fornax ( see section [ tar_sel ] for more details ) . ]",
    "we selected targets in two satellite galaxies of the milky way : the sgr dsph and the fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy .",
    "their distance moduli are taken as 17.02 mag for sgr dsph ( mateo et al .",
    "1995 ) and 20.66 mag for fornax ( bersier 2000 ) .",
    "sgr dsph is located behind the galactic bulge .",
    "it is a substantial galaxy , but it is being disrupted by the milky way : the tidal tails surround the galaxy .",
    "the majority of its stellar population has a metallicity in the range [ fe / h]=@xmath17 to @xmath18 and an age of @xmath19gyr ( bellazzini et al .",
    "two of the four planetary nebulae in this galaxy have identical abundances of [ fe / h]@xmath20 ( dudziak et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the carbon stars discovered by whitelock et al .",
    "( 1996 , 1999 ) are plausibly related to the same population as the planetary nebulae . a more metal - rich population with [ fe / h]=@xmath21 also exists ( zijlstra et al . 2006a ; bonifacio et al . 2004 ) , although it may not be uniformly distributed over the galaxy .",
    "finally , there is a minor , very metal - poor , population with fe / h]@xmath22 which is seen in the globular clusters , but also in one tidal - tail planetary nebula .",
    "fornax shows similar mass and properties to sgr dsph , but is too far from the galaxy to suffer obvious tidal disruption .",
    "it also shows evidence for an extended period of star formation with the metallicity increasing over time . the younger population ( at @xmath23yr even younger than sgr dsph )",
    "has a metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath24 ( saviane et al . 2000 ) to @xmath25 ( pont et al . 2004 ) .",

    "first , we used the list of carbon stars given by whitelock et al .",
    "( 1999  their table 1 ) with preference being given to the miras with measured periods or to stars with near - infrared red colours ; these are spectroscopically confirmed carbon stars .",
    "these are the stars with wmif names in column 3 of table [ log_obs ] .",
    "secondly , stars were selected from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) catalogue with the following properties : @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "this selection should isolate carbon stars comparable to , or somewhat redder than , those discussed by whitelock et al . and are a subset of those that have been monitored by menzies et al .",
    "( in preparation ) at @xmath39 with the 1.4 m infrared survey facility ( irsf ) at sutherland .",
    "the carbon - rich nature of these stars has yet to be spectroscopically confirmed .",
    "indeed it is not possible to disentangle oxygen - rich from carbon rich red agb stars from jhk colours alone but in a low metallicity environment like sgr , we expect more agb stars to be carbon rich than in the galaxy .",
    "all the stars with wmif names in table [ log_obs ] have been confirmed as carbon stars from spectroscopy ( whitelock et al .",
    "1999 ) and we will assume that all the other observed stars are carbon - rich , keeping in mind that some might be oxygen - rich .",
    "we will assume [ fe / h]@xmath40 , based on the descendant pne population ( zijlstra et al .",
    "2006a ) and the carbon - star population ( whitelock et al . 1996 , 1999 ) , but a range of metallicities is probably represented .",
    "de laverny et al . ( 2006 ) find for two sgr dsph carbon stars ( not observed by us ) [ m / h]@xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "two carbon stars in fornax were observed : these have similarly red colours to the sgr dsph sample and are spectroscopically confirmed carbon stars ( matsuura et al .",
    "both stars are located in the outer regions of fornax ( @xmath43 and 15@xmath44 from the centre ) .",
    "we assume that they have the [ fe / h]@xmath45 of the dominant population , as the more metal - rich population is concentrated to the centre ( saviane et al . 2000 ) .",
    "we also observed the star iras 201761458 , selected from mauron et al .",
    "this is a carbon star in the galactic halo .",
    "all agb carbon stars in the halo are expected to have escaped from one of the satellite galaxies , and the proximity of this star to the main body of sgr dsph may indicate an association .",
    "assuming an absolute magnitude of @xmath46 , its distance is around 15kpc which is not inconsistent with the tidal tail of sgr ( law et al .",
    "the star lies several degrees off the location of the tidal stream ( majewski et al .",
    "2003 ) , but as noted by these authors , carbon stars may trace a different tidal event than the m stars .",
    "mauron et al . (",
    "2004 ) argue against an association with sgr dsph .",
    "the interstellar reddening towards fornax is quite small , @xmath47 , and thus negligible in @xmath48 ( demers et al .",

    ", the reddening is estimated to be @xmath49 ( layden & sarajedini 2000 ) .",

    "the tip of the red giant branch ( rgb ) is clearly visible , with a gap just above it showing the onset of hydrogen burning and thermal pulses .",
    "most of the selected stars have magnitudes consistent with thermal - pulsing agb stars .",

    "this will provide total mass - loss rates of 700 and 1600 times , respectively , higher than the dust mass - loss rates in sgr dsph and fornax .",
    "note , however , that these are upper limits , as the dust expansion velocity is probably smaller in these galaxies , as well as the drift velocity , but no observations have yet been made that measure the expansion velocities of carbon star at low metallicities .",

    "the amount of carbon dust may still depend on the number of available seeds ( e.g. tic ) which can introduce a metallicity dependence , but it is less likely to be a linear one .      for a better understanding of the evolution of these agb stars , it is interesting to compare the measured mass - loss rates with the rate at which mass is consumed by nuclear burning @xmath77 .",

    "this diagram clearly indicates that all the measured mass - loss rates are below the classical single - scattering limit .",
    "thus no multiple scattering of photons by dust in the envelope is needed to explain the observed mass - loss rates as can be necessary for the very high mass - loss rates measured for some galactic agb stars .",
    "note though , that extremely high mass - loss rates are rare even in the galaxy where they are thought to represent the brief end of the most massive agb stars .",
    "it is hardly surprising that nothing similar has been found within our incomplete sample of stars in small galaxies which are not generally believed to have an intermediate mass population .",

    "this has important consequences for the evolution of these stars .",
    "their evolution will terminate when the mantle becomes depleted by mass - loss long before the nuclear burning core can grow significantly .",
    "similar conclusions were reached about agb stars in the lmc ( van loon et al .",
    "this is independent on the value of @xmath69 we assume as the measured mass - loss rates are more than one order of magnitude higher than the nuclear burning rates .",

    "stars with similar luminosities and mass - loss rates have also been observed in the large magellanic cloud ( van loon et al .",
    "these authors have pointed out , from dynamical considerations following gail & sedlmayr ( 1987 ) , that dust - driven winds below a few @xmath88m@xmath6yr@xmath7 with luminosities around a few @xmath89l@xmath6 should not exist .",
    "our observations thus disagree with those predictions .      to compare the mass - loss rates we measured in fornax and sgr dsph with mass - loss rates from agb stars in the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) ( thus in more metal - rich galaxies ) , we used the mass - loss rates derived by groenewegen et al .",

    "stars in sgr dsph show a similar behaviour , but the mass - loss rates begin to increase at m@xmath90@xmath144 . the fact that the mass - loss rates are high for lower luminosity in the lmc than in the other galaxies could be explained by the higher metallicity of the lmc with respect to the three other galaxies .",
    "it has been shown that at lower metallicity , stars become carbon - rich earlier on the agb ( e.g. , lagadec et al .",
    "so agb stars become c - rich later in the lmc .",
    "the superwind might thus begin when the stars become carbon rich in the lmc , while the stars might be c - rich well before the onset of the superwind in the lower metallicity galaxies .",
    "the two sgr dsph stars with the highest mass - loss rates and m@xmath90@xmath144 ( sgr16 and sgr18 ) would thus be stars where the superwind phase necessary to explain the densities seen in typical planetary nebulae ( renzini 1981 ) has already begun .",
    "if we compare the dust mass - loss rates for a given luminosity , then metallicity effects seem to appear . indeed , for a given bolometric magnitude fainter than 4.5",
    ", stars in the sgr dsph and the smc seem to have a smaller mass - loss rate than stars in the lmc",
    ". this could be due to the fact that sgr dsph and the smc have a smaller metallicity than the lmc and that at low luminosity less dust is formed in these galaxies than in the lmc , leading to a lower radiation pressure on dust grains and thus smaller mass - loss rates .",
    "observations of a bigger sample of agb stars in different galaxies are however needed to confirm this .",
    "indeed our mcs sample has been selected from the msx catalogue ( egan et al .",

    "the values obtained with the two different methods are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "these mass - loss rates are higher than the nuclear burning rates , so these stars will terminate their agb evolution by the depletion of their stellar mantles , before their cores can grow significantly .    using previous work to get an estimation of the dust - to - gas mass ratio for the stars observed we found that most of them had very low mass - loss rates for their luminosity .",
