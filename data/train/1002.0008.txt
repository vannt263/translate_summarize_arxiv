    "photometric redshifts have been used extensively in studies of galaxy evolution , particularly for sources that are too faint for feasible spectroscopic detection of absorption or emission lines .",
    "photo - z s are just beginning to find application to measurements of cosmic structure , particularly in the determination of source redshifts for weak gravitational lensing surveys ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "projects in development plan to measure photometric redshifts for @xmath3 galaxies , far more than can be practically determined spectroscopically .",
    "yet the cosmological measures that weak - lensing surveys have as goals are extremely sensitive to biases or other miscalibrations of the photo - z scale : biases as small as @xmath4 will overwhelm the statistical errors on cosmology in these experiments @xcite .",
    "the photo - z technique has never been subject to such demands on its accuracy , so we need to examine carefully the strategies for achieving them .",
    "a photo - z algorithm must somehow be taught to convert broadband fluxes into redshifts .",
    "this can be done by fitting to theoretical or empirical templates for galaxy spectra ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; or by completely empirical machine - learning techniques , _",
    "e.g. _ neural nets @xcite , that are trained with a sample of galaxies of known spectroscopic redshift .",
    "there is a difficulty , however , in that many imaging surveys intend to measure photo - z s from galaxies that are too faint to obtain the spectroscopic information needed to form templates or obtain spectroscopic training redshifts .",
    "one must therefore take on some degree of faith the assertion that a photo - z algorithm trained on brighter galaxies will return sufficiently unbiased redshifts for galaxies beyond the spectroscopic limit .",
    "we investigate in this paper the sizes of biases that we might expect to arise because of differences between the faint galaxy population and the brighter spectroscopic population .",
    "in particular :    * fainter galaxies will tend to be at higher redshifts , where active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are more frequent or brighter than at low redshift .",
    "furthermore , optically - based spectroscopy is inefficient in the `` desert '' between @xmath5 , where quasar activity peaks .",
    "we can ask , therefore , whether the different agn characteristics of the fainter galaxies could bias the photo - z s trained on low - z galaxies . * for elliptical galaxies , there is a well - known color - magnitude relation .",
    "as we move to lower luminosity galaxies in this red sequence , stellar populations traverse a path in the age - metallicity plane .",
    "stellar populations of the luminous galaxies of different hubble types that would typically be used for photo - z training will not cover the same locus in the age - metallicity plane .",
    "would photo - z s trained on bright galaxies produce biased redshifts for fainter ellipticals ?",
    "we investigate this by examining the metallicity dependence of photo - z results for old stellar populations when training on the bright hubble sequence .",
    "there are additional complications from the age - metallicity degeneracy .",
    "accordingly , we also estimate the age dependent behavior of photo - z biases .    in the rumsfeld parlance , these are `` known unknowns '' of the faint galaxy population : a photo - z algorithm might be designed which could compensate for these two differences between faint and bright galaxies .",
    "but we will use a photo - z algorithm that is ignorant of these effects , so that they can serve as models for `` unknown unknowns '' which might bias faint photo - z estimates . in this way",
    "we might learn how safe or dangerous it is to extrapolate training sets or templates to fainter magnitudes .",
    "probing agn contamination biases necessitates the preparation of an appropriate galaxy spectrum and the use of fitting software to determine the photometric redshift @xmath6 .",
    "contaminated galaxies are modeled by introducing a qso spectrum as an impurity to the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of galaxies .",
    "le  phare _ software package is used to compute the photometric redshifts .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "le  phare _ fits to a magnitude catalog of template galaxies . in this case",
    ", the catalog consists of 4 known galaxies from @xcite[cww ] and 3 simulated galaxies from @xcite[bc96 ] as well as linear interpolations ( via flux ) of these .",
    "the cww galaxies are early types , sbc and scd spirals , and irregulars , while the bc96 galaxies are @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10gyr in age . altogether , including interpolations ,",
    "the catalog is composed of 72 models .",
    "we investigate two sets of filters .",
    "the first includes 4 hubble deep field north ( hdfn ) filters ( f300w , f450w , f606w , and f814w ) and three near - infrared filters ( jbb , h , and k ) included in the _ le  phare _ software package .",
    "the second set is the 5 sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) filter set ( u , g , r , i , and z ) .",
    "_ le  phare _ compiles this catalog by calculating the magnitudes for each galaxy sed with each filter at redshifts from @xmath11 to @xmath12 in increments of @xmath13 . note that the template galaxies contain no agn signal .",
    "a second input catalog describes the galaxies for which @xmath6 is to be estimated .",
    "we synthesize agn - contaminated magnitudes by : making a qso template spectrum ; normalizing this template to the galaxy seds ; contaminating the _",
    "le  phare _ templates with a specified fraction of agn flux ; then calculating apparent magnitudes at various redshifts and agn contaminations .",
    "a template qso spectrum over a wide wavelength span is needed in order to synthesize agn contaminated seds . @xcite and @xcite provide suitable qso template spectra ; the former covers a broad uv - nir ( 800.5- 8554.5 ) wavelength range while the latter extends further into the nir ( 5801- 35095.4 ) .",
    "we scale the glikman spectrum to match the vanden berk spectrum at 847  nm , where both are well measured , and then concatenate the two",
    ".    the qso contamination is specified by the fraction @xmath14 of the flux contributed by the qso .",
    "specifically , for a chosen galaxy template @xmath15 and our template qso spectrum @xmath16 we first determine the normalization @xmath17 which yields @xmath18 where the integration bounds @xmath19  nm to @xmath20 m span the range over which both spectra are known . for a desired contamination @xmath21 ,",
    "the galaxy rest - frame sed is taken as @xmath22 apparent magnitudes in the chosen filter sets are calculated using the standard formulae for redshifted sources .",
    "we use the same qso template spectrum for all levels of contamination . in reality",
    ", low - luminosity agn will have different spectra than bright qsos , _",
    "e.g. _ weaker broad lines , however the effect of contamination on photo - z s that we derive will still be crudely correct .",
    "the catalog of agn - contaminated galaxies contains 7 galaxy types  the 4 cww templates ( of type e , sbc , scd , and irr ) and the 3 bc96 simulated star forming galaxies ( denoted i2 , i05 , and i005 for their ages)at redshifts in the range @xmath23 in steps of @xmath24 for sdss filters , and in steps of @xmath24 from @xmath25 and steps of @xmath26 for @xmath27 for the hdfn filters , with agn contaminations in the range @xmath28 in @xmath29 increments .",
    "le  phare _ to obtain estimates for @xmath6 .",
    "the quantity of interest is the redshift bias between the nominal and photometric redshifts , to wit , @xmath30 .",
    "all galaxy types using either filter set have a non - trivial bias @xmath31 induced by agn contamination .",
    "we first examine how @xmath31 depends on contamination fraction @xmath21 , at fixed @xmath32 and galaxy type .",
    "figure  [ gbu ] illustrates the range of behaviors found .",
    "the i2 galaxy shows a simple linear bias - contamination response with a well - defined @xmath33 . in cases like the scd galaxy at @xmath34 ,",
    "the linear trend gains steps or wiggles , which we believe is induced by the discrete steps in galaxy type that _ le  phare _ takes when finding a best - fit template . in this case",
    "we define @xmath33 by a least - squares fit through all the data points .",
    "finally there are cases like the high redshift e - type in which the best - fit photo - z becomes `` catastrophically '' incorrect above some contamination level . here the agn light has moved the galaxy toward some new part of the color manifold of the templates rather than inducing a small differential change .",
    "we define @xmath33 by manually selecting a region of @xmath21 that is below the catastrophe and fitting a slope to this region .",
    "we essentially ignore the catastrophic failures because we are more interested in biases induced by gradual evolution in the agn fraction .",
    "we will focus henceforth on the slope @xmath33 in the vicinity of @xmath35 .",
    "figure  [ dzdp ] shows @xmath33 from the low - contamination domain in both filter sets .",
    "the different templates show a variety of behaviors , and some are erratic due to discreteness in the _",
    "le  phare _ fitting , particularly with the sdss filter set , which offers poor photo - z constraints in some domains due to lack of nir coverage .    the important point , however , is that the bias responses @xmath33 are @xmath36 over most of the color and galaxy - type domain . _",
    "a 1% contamination with agn light causes a photo - z bias of @xmath37 _ if the photo - z algorithm is using uncontaminated templates .",
    "application of photo - z s to cosmic - shear measurements require that biases be held below @xmath38 , which means that the mean agn contamination of the target sample would need to be determined to @xmath39 in order for the resultant photo - z biases to make insignificant impact on the inferred cosmology",
    ". we will not know the faint - galaxy agn fraction to anywhere near this precision , so this would be a major problem .",
    "of course we are using a naive photo - z estimator : one could include a qso template in the fitting process ( as in the option _",
    "le  phare _ offers , or as described in @xcite , which includes object classification ) , or attempt to construct an empirical training set of bright galaxies that spans the range of agn contamination of the faint set .",
    "this would greatly reduce the photo - z bias in our simple simulated catalog .",
    "the behavior of real agn is , however , much more complex than our simple single qso template , and it is likely that the faint population has different agn spectra than the bright galaxies that might serve as templates .",
    "we simply point out that photo - z biases can be very sensitive to agn light , and it is risky to extrapolate agn characteristics to a new population .",
    "we use stellar population models to estimate the redshift bias induced by a metallicity mismatch between target galaxies and _ le  phare _",
    "s templates ( _ le  phare _ uses the same extended cww catalog used above ) . the galaxy evolution simulation code galaxev is used here to generate a magnitude catalog for galaxies with near - solar metallicity with a @xmath40 ages of 10gyr .",
    "we use the standard model as described in @xcite[bc03 ] .",
    "specifically , the galaxy models employed here use the stelib and basel spectral libraries , a simple stellar population ( ssp ) star formation rate , the chabrier initial mass function , and the 1994 padova evolutionary tracks ( per recommendation of the code s authors ) .",
    "galaxev produces a table of magnitudes and ages at various redshifts for a given galaxy model and filter set .",
    "the same sdss and infrared supplemented hdfn filters from the agn contamination study are used to calculate these magnitudes .",
    "galaxev produces colors for metallicities @xmath41 and 2.5 ( models m42 , m52 , m62 , and m72 in galaxev ) .",
    "we also produce colors for metallicities 0.3 , 0.7 , and @xmath42 by interpolating between these four galaxev spectra .",
    "we further employ galaxev to investigate biases due to age misestimates .",
    "we generate solar metallicity models with z = 0 ages of 11 , 9 , and 8 gyr .",
    "note that the fiducial model here is still the 10gyr old solar metallicity galaxy , but in contrast to what is done in the metallicity study , we now hold the metallicity fixed and vary the age .",
    "calculating the bias due to a small metallicity mismatch requires removing the fiducial bias present resulting from inherent differences between the galaxev spectra and _ le  phare _ s catalog of templates . at each redshift , we take an elliptical galaxy with solar metallicity as our benchmark . the solar bias , @xmath43 , is defined as the difference between the solar model s redshift and _ le  phare _ s estimate :  @xmath44 . for any particular metallicity ,",
    "the bias due to metallicity mismatch is then @xmath45 .",
    "hence by definition we assign zero metallicity bias to a solar - metallicity population , for any chosen filter set , population age , and redshift .",
    "figure  [ mzb ] illustrates the biases from metallicity offsets as a function of redshift between @xmath40 and @xmath46 .",
    "five models are present in the plot , each is 10gyr old at @xmath40 with metallicities 0.22.5@xmath47 . as the models get more metal rich , the redshift bias increases , that is , the photometric redshift gets larger than the model s redshift . in the redshift range that was studied ,",
    "the super- and sub - solar models both had biases of up to @xmath48 for metallicities @xmath36  dex away from solar .",
    "this suggests that biases of @xmath49 would result from shifts of only @xmath0  dex in the mean metallicity of an old population away from the metallicity of the training set . for comparison",
    ", current modelling of age and metallicity variation along the red sequence of sdss galaxies suggests a @xmath50  dex change in metallicity across 4 magnitudes of galaxy luminosity @xcite .",
    "therefore the biases in photo - z s of faint red - sequence galaxies can be highly significant if the photo - z s are trained exclusively on brighter red - sequence members .",
    "biases from age estimates errors are computed in the same manner as in the metallicity case .",
    "the intrinsic bias from the benchmark 10gyr solar metallicity galaxy , @xmath51 , must be subtracted from the total , @xmath52 , to arrive at the bias attributable to age mismatching : @xmath53 .",
    "figure  [ azb ] portrays the induced biases in both filter sets .",
    "compared to the metallicity - induced biases , these show little structure outside of the feature near @xmath54 for the sdss filters ( also found in the metallicity plots ) , perhaps suggesting that the photo - z s are more sensitive to metallicity offsets . for the hdfn filter set ,",
    "the bias only becomes comparable at higher @xmath32 when the age offset is 2gyr . in both studies ,",
    "the hdfn sets exhibit a slightly wider range in biases which may mean that extra bands may be more confusing for _ le  phare _ if the templates and data are not initially well matched .",
    "photometric redshifts resemble the real redshifts only as closely as the training sets mimic the objects of interest . in the cases of agn activity and metallicity variation , we find that even very small mismatches between the mean photometric target and the training set can induce photo - z biases large enough to corrupt significantly the validity of derived cosmological parameters . in particular , we find that a metallicity shift of @xmath0  dex in an old population , or contamination of any galaxy spectrum with @xmath1 agn flux , is sufficient to induce a @xmath2 bias in photo - z .",
    "miscalculating the age of a galaxy by 2gyr may also result in similar a bias . in a real survey",
    ", we can expect differences far larger than this between the faint photometry survey targets and the bright spectroscopic targets used for photo - z training .    while simple models are used here to study redshift biases ,",
    "the results indicate a need to develop training sets that encompass the full range of behavior of the photo - z target population .",
    "our study uses a worst - case situation in that the photo - z algorithm is given no information on the physical effects underlying the bias ( agn or a luminosity - metallicity correlation ) . in reality",
    "the training sets can include galaxies with agn of varying brightness and some galaxies of lower luminosity , which would ameliorate the biases we have found .",
    "however the extreme sensitivity of the photo - z to these effects suggests that it will be dangerous to extrapolate from the behavior of bright training - set galaxies to a target photo - z sample that extends to significantly higher redshift and lower luminosity , since even subtle differences in spectral behavior can lead to important biases .",
    "furthermore we have investigated two known differences between the faint and bright populations , but there may be differences that have not yet been discovered because there are no detailed spectroscopic surveys of the galaxies fainter than 24th magnitude that will comprise the bulk of future weak - lensing surveys .",
    "these results highlight the desirability of training photo - z s with complete spectroscopic surveys to @xmath5525 mag , so that the training set is representative of the galaxies for which photo - z s are being obtained .",
    "this work is supported by grant ast-0607667 from the nsf and doe grant de - fg02 - 95er40893 .",
