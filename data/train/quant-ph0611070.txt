    "one of the fundamental postulates in quantum mechanics states that a closed system naturally evolves according to a suitable unitary transformation .",
    "it is then understood that every open system can in principle be _ closed _ , in the sense that , by extending the boundaries of the subsystem of interest , it is in principle possible to reach a situation in which everything inside the boundaries obeys a global unitary evolution . in this case , _ information _ is conserved , that is , there is no net flow of information from the global system .",
    "the global evolution preserves indeed the amount of information that can be extracted from an arbitrary set of signal states in which a classical alphabet is encoded , allowing only transfers of information from a subsystem to another .",
    "here we are interested in a much more particular situation , that is , when the quantum system of interest  the _ input _ system  unitarily interacts with an environment on which we can perform measurements . in other words , even if the system itself evolves as an open quantum system , according to the dynamics described by a _ quantum channel _",
    "@xcite , the complementary subsystem closing the main system is bounded and can be monitored by suitable measurements . we can then exploit a kind of feedback control on the main system , in which we apply some opportune corrections to the system , conditional on the outcomes of the measurement that was performed on the environment .",
    "this procedure is called _ environment - assisted channel correction _  @xcite and recently attracted a lot of interest  @xcite , also in connection with the recently discovered _ state merging _",
    "protocol  @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we focus on a particular type of open system dynamics , which are usually believed to play a fundamental role in understanding the _ quantum - to - classical _ transition , namely , decohering evolutions  @xcite .",
    "this kind of channels causes loss of coherence in quantum systems , and this phenomenon usually constitutes the major practical limitation in quantum information processing .",
    "a large part of the literature concerning quantum error correction is devoted to engineering methods to combat the effects of decoherence  @xcite . here",
    "we propose a decoherence correction method based on an environment - assisted control , providing necessary and sufficient conditions for such a method to be effective .",
    "moreover , our analysis will be able to shed some light on the information exchange dynamics between a quantum system and the environment during a decohering evolution . from this point of view",
    ", we will also review the quantum eraser arrangement  @xcite as a particular example of decohering evolution with a controllable environment , in which a _ re - coherence _ is possible conditional on the outcomes of a suitable environment observable .",
    "let s denote by @xmath1 the `` quantum algebra '' of all bounded operators on the hilbert space @xmath2 , with @xmath3 , and by @xmath4 the `` classical algebra '' , namely any maximal abelian subalgebra @xmath5 .",
    "clearly , all operators in @xmath4 can be jointly diagonalized on a common orthonormal basis , which in the following will be denoted as @xmath6 . then",
    ", the classical algebra @xmath4 is also the linear span of the one - dimensional projectors @xmath7 , whence @xmath8 is a @xmath9-dimensional vector space . according to the above general framework , we call _ ( complete ) decoherence map _ a completely positive identity - preserving ( i. e. trace - preserving in the schrdinger picture ) map @xmath10 which asymptotically maps any observable @xmath11 into a corresponding classical observable @xmath12 , while preserving any element of the classical algebra @xmath4 . the defining properties of a decoherence map",
    "are then written explicitely as : @xmath13 and @xmath14    an important requirement in the above definition of decoherence processes is that any classical observable is preserved .",
    "notice that , for example , the case of amplitude damping channels is not covered by the definition , since in this case any state is driven to a fixed state , namely not all classical observables are preserved .",
    "it is easy to see that the set of decoherence maps is convex ( i. e. if we mix two decoherence maps we obtain again a decoherence map ) . according to eq . , the set of decoherence maps is a subset of the convex set of maps that preserve the elements of the classical algebra @xmath4",
    ". the convex structure of decoherence maps has been analysed in ref .  @xcite using the following representation theorem    theorem a map @xmath10 preserves all elements of the classical algebra @xmath15 if and only if it has the form @xmath16 @xmath17 denoting the schur product of operators @xmath18 and @xmath19 , i.  e.    @xmath20    @xmath21 and @xmath22 being the matrix elements of @xmath18 and @xmath19 in the basis @xmath23 , and @xmath24 being a correlation matrix , i.e. a positive semidefinite matrix with @xmath25 for all @xmath26 .",
    "incidentally , notice that the operator @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ schurmap ] ) is isometrically equivalent to the choi operator  @xcite @xmath28 , which in turn is in one - to - one linear correspondence with the jamiokowski operator  @xcite @xmath29 .",
    "theorem  1 establishes a one - to - one linear correspondence between maps that preserve the classical algebra @xmath4 and correlation matrices .",
    "this means that both sets share exactly the same convex structure , whence a map is extremal if and only if the corresponding correlation matrix is an extreme point .",
    "the decohering evolutions , that have the additional property of eq . , are represented by correlation matrices @xmath27 with the property @xmath30 .",
    "the extreme points of the set of correlation matrices have been characterized by li and tam in ref .",
    "they proved that for @xmath31 , a correlation matrix is extremal if and only if it is rank - one .",
    "this statement , translated in terms of maps , informs us that , for @xmath31 extreme points of the convex set of maps that preserve the classical algebra are unitary maps  @xcite . as a consequence , for qubits and qutrits ,",
    "every decoherence map can be written as @xmath32 where @xmath33 s are unitary operators and @xmath34 is a probability distribution , namely any decoherence map is _ random - unitary_. however , already for @xmath35 it is possible to explicitly show  @xcite that there exist extreme correlation matrices with rank greater than one , and hence , decoherence maps that are not random - unitary .    notice that the action of the map @xmath10 in the schrdinger picture can be simply and _ uniquely _ derived from the trace - duality formula @xmath36=\\tr[o\\ \\dual{\\map e}(\\rho)]$ ] . from eq .",

    "@xcite , the following general situation is considered .",
    "a channel @xmath10 , acting on density matrices @xmath39 on the input hilbert space @xmath44 , is given .",

    "( [ eq : unitary - real ] ) , and for all possible decompositions of the channel @xmath10 into pure kraus representations @xmath48  @xcite , there exists a suitable rank - one povm on the environment , let us call it @xmath49 , @xmath50 , such that @xmath51.\\ ] ] within this setting , one can then think of performing a correction @xmath52 on the system conditional on the @xmath53-th outcome of the environment measurement , thus obtaining the following overall corrected channel @xmath54 in ref .",

    "e. such that it is possible to have @xmath55 , for all @xmath39are the random unitary ones .",
    "therefore , it follows that one can perfectly correct any decoherence map for qubits and qutrits by monitoring the environment .",
    "the correction is achieved by retrieving the index @xmath53 in eq .",
    "( [ randomunitary ] ) via the measurement on the environment represented by the rank - one povm @xmath49 , and then by applying the inverse of the unitary transformation @xmath33 on the system .",
    "therefore , the random - unitary map simply leaks @xmath56 bits of classical information into the environment , where @xmath57 denotes the shannon entropy and @xmath34 is the probability of the outcome `` @xmath53 '' .",
    "the effects of decoherence can be completely eliminated by recovering such classical information , without any prior knowledge about the input state .",
    "it is now interesting to address the problem of estimating the amount of classical information needed in order to invert a random - unitary decoherence map .",
    "if the environment is initially in a pure state , say @xmath58 , a useful quantity to deal with is the so - called entropy exchange  @xcite @xmath59 defined as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the reduced environment state after the interaction with the system in the state @xmath39 , and @xmath62 $ ] is the von neumann entropy .",
    "the entropy exchange quantifies the information flow from the system to the environment and , for all input states @xmath39 , one has the bound  @xcite @xmath63 , namely the entropy exchange @xmath59 bounds the entropy production at each step of the decoherence process .    in the case of initially pure environment ,",
    "the entropy exchange depends only on the map @xmath10 and on the input state of the system @xmath39 , regardless of the particular system - environment interaction @xmath47 that is chosen to model @xmath10 via eq . .",
    "in particular , by the kolmogorov decomposition for nonnegative definite matrices it is always possible to write @xmath64 for a suitable set of normalized vectors @xmath65 , and the map @xmath66 can be realized as @xmath67 $ ] , where the unitary interaction @xmath47 gives the transformation @xmath68 with this choice of the interaction @xmath47 , the final reduced state of the environment is @xmath69 . in order to evaluate the entropy exchange @xmath59 for a decoherence map @xmath70 , one can then use the formula @xmath71 which follows immediately from the fact that @xmath72 , and @xmath61 are both reduced states of the same bipartite state @xmath73 .    when a map can be inverted by monitoring the environment  i .",
    "e. in the random - unitary case ",
    "the entropy exchange @xmath74 provides a lower bound to the amount of classical information @xmath56 that must be collected from the environment in order to perform the correction scheme of ref .",
    "in fact , assuming a random - unitary decomposition ( [ randomunitary ] ) and using the formula  @xcite @xmath75 |i\\>\\<j| \\right)$ ] , we obtain @xmath76 the inequality comes from the fact that the diagonal entries of a density matrix are always majorized by its eigenvalues , and it becomes equality if and only if @xmath77/d=\\delta_{ij}$ ] , i.  e. the map admits a random - unitary decomposition with _",
    "orthogonal _ unitary operators . moreover , from eq .",
    "( [ sex_and_xi ] ) we have @xmath78 , whence the relation @xmath79 which gives a lower bound on the amount of information needed from the environment in order to invert the decohering evolution .    on the other hand , the random - unitary representation ( [ randomunitary ] ) , when possible , is highly non unique .",
    "this means that , depending on the particular unitary operators chosen , the entropy @xmath56 can be made as large as desired .",
    "however , it is still possible to provide a ( generally non tight ) upper bound to the _ minimum value _ of the amount of classical information @xmath56 .",
    "such a bound is derived in ref .  @xcite as @xmath80 , and hence it generally holds that @xmath81 eq .",
    "( [ bounds ] ) is true for all dimensions @xmath9 .",
    "it is then reasonable that it does not accurately describe the peculiar geometry enjoyed by two - dimensional systems .",
    "in fact , in ref .  @xcite it is proved that for @xmath82 , it always holds that @xmath83 however , already for @xmath84 , there exist random - unitary decoherence maps for which @xmath85 _ strictly _ , and at the moment we are not able to provide a better upper bound than the one given above .",
    "our results about the possibility of inverting decohering evolutions by collecting classical information from the environment can boast a celebrated _ ante litteram _ example , namely the quantum eraser of ref .",
    "@xcite . in this section",
    "we briefly review this example using a compact notation that will turn out to be useful for its generalization to similar cases in higher dimension .",
    "let an excited atom pass through a double - slit , as depicted in fig  [ fig : eraser ] .",
    "its state can be described in full generality by a density matrix @xmath39 , such that , if the orthogonal states @xmath86 and @xmath87 correspond to the particle passing through the slit number 1 or number 2 , respectively , the probability of detecting the particle passing through the slit number 1  ( 2 ) is @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) . notice that @xmath39 can be a pure state , as in the original quantum eraser proposal @xmath90 , with @xmath91 .",
    "if nothing is in between the slits and the collecting screen at the end , fringes can be observed in the interference pattern , coming from the non - null off - diagonal terms @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "but if we place a probe , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : eraser ] , consisting of two resonant cavities initialized in the vacuum state @xmath94 , then interference fringes disappear , since the atom , while relaxing to its ground state , leaves a photon in one out of the two cavities , depending of the slit it passed through . the interaction of the atom with the probe can be described by means of a controlled unitary @xmath47 of the form  ( [ unitary ] ) , namely @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the orthogonal states of the electromagnetic field corresponding to the situations `` one photon in cavity 1 '' and `` one photon in cavity 2 '' , respectively . since @xmath96 and @xmath97 are orthogonal",
    ", the input state @xmath39 instantaneously collapses to its decohered final state @xmath42 , and off - diagonal terms are annihilated .",
    "this fact is usually interpreted as saying that the probe , by means of the interaction  ( [ eq : interprobe ] ) , keeps track of the _ which - way _ information about the atom s path , in such a way that such an information can be in principle extracted by the experimenter . nevertheless , it is still possible to _ erase _ the which - path from the probe by measuring on it the fourier - conjugate observable @xmath98 , where @xmath99 .",
    "experimentally , this can be done long _ after _ the atom passed through the cavities , by removing at once both mirrors in fig .",
    "[ fig : eraser ] , in such a way that the detector between the two cavities is coupled with the symmetric state of the radiation inside them  @xcite .",
    "then , separating the two subensembles of events corresponding to the measurement outcomes @xmath100 and @xmath101 , it is possible to retrieve the original interference fringes .",
    "we interpret the whole double - slit setup as being a realization of a completely decohering process described by the channel @xmath102 such a channel is actually random - unitary ( it is a decohering process in dimension two ) , and hence is correctable by an environment - assisted control procedure .",
    "in particular , for the atom - radiation interaction given by eq . , by measuring the observable @xmath98 on the probe , we obtain a realization of the random - unitary kraus representation @xmath103 in conclusion , conditionally on the probe outcomes , both atom final states conserve the original off - diagonal terms ( a part of an innocuous unitary rotation ) , and fringes appear on the intereference pattern on the screen . moreover , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : qubits - info ] ) , since @xmath104 , we know that the erasure process picks up from the probe @xmath105 bit of information .    the quantum eraser can be simply generalized to the case of instantaneous decoherence of @xmath0dimensional quantum system",
    ". this situation can be thought of as a kind of `` @xmath9-slits '' interference experiment , where an excited atom emits a photon in one out of @xmath9 possible cavities .",
    "analogously to the two - dimensional situation , the correlation matrix describing the intantaneous decoherence channel is @xmath104 , namely one has @xmath106 .",
    "the channel itself admits the random - unitary representation @xmath107 where the unitary operators @xmath108 s generalize @xmath109 and @xmath110 to the @xmath9-dimensional case . in this case , for the system - probe interaction given by @xmath111 , the terms of the random - unitary decomposition can be isolated by measuring the probe observable @xmath112 , where the vectors @xmath113 are the fourier transform @xmath114 of the elements of the decoherence basis @xmath23 . once the measurement outcome `` @xmath115 '' is known , it is enough to undo the unitary @xmath108 to retrieve any unknown initial state @xmath39 .",
    "the amount of classical information to be erased from the probe is then equal to @xmath116 .",
    "an equivalent way of presenting the @xmath0dimensional eraser is by stating that _ any von neumann measurement on a system can be erased by its fourier complementary measurement on the environment . _",
    "the istantaneous decoherence @xmath117 @xmath118 can be indeed considered as the effect of the von neumann measurement of the observable @xmath119 , while the interaction @xmath120 can be viewed as the transfer of classical information from the system to a quantum register . on the other hand ,",
    "the fourier - complementary measurement @xmath121 allows one to extract from the classical register the information needed to restore coherence in the system .",
    "quite naturally , this amount of information is exactly the same amount that was stored into the register , maximized over all possible unknown states @xmath39 , i.e. @xmath122 .",
