    "the form of the magnetoelectic coupling term @xmath25 can be explained by using general symmetry arguments .",
    "namely , the onset of ferroelectric order requires the breaking of spatial inversion symmetry , whereas the appearance of a spontaneous magnetization is connected with the breakdown of time reversal symmetry .",
    "the coupling term in ( [ l ] ) obeys those two conditions and allows for ferroic order with simultaneous nonzero @xmath19 and @xmath20 .    in further calculations we use a dimensionless form of the free energy expansion ( [ ddf ] ) which is obtained from ( [ l ] ) by dividing both sides of ( [ l ] ) by the constant value @xmath26 . in effect ,",

    "explicitly , since the renormalized transition temperature is determined from the condition @xmath48 , this yields :    @xmath49    [ trc ]    this is one of the interesting results .",
