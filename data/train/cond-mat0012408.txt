    "the nature of the spatially inhomogeneous small - moment antiferromagnetism ( afm ) observed in neutron scattering experiments@xcite below @xmath2k and its interaction with superconductivity ( @xmath3k ) remain central issues in determining the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter of upt@xmath0 .",
    "the unusual h - t phase diagram@xcite at ambient pressure apparently shows three superconducting phases in the mixed state and two meissner phases .",
    "experimental studies using hydrostatic@xcite and uniaxial@xcite pressure reveal the existence of a critical pressure above which the zero - field transition splitting disappears .",
    "this complex phase diagram strongly suggests that superconductivity in this heavy - electron material is unconventional and has provided motivation for much theoretical work.@xcite proposed theories range from odd - in - frequency pairing@xcite to multicomponent order parameters .",
    "the latter may belong to a single multidimensional representation of the symmetry group ( see refs . for reviews ) , or they may belong to different representations of the crystal point group that are either accidentally degenerate,@xcite reflect a ` higher symmetry ' of the crystal@xcite or of spin space@xcite .    as briefly summarized below , experiments suggest an intriguing interplay between superconductivity and antiferromagnetism ; however , an interpretation without significant ambiguity has not yet emerged . here , we focus on one theoretical proposal : an odd - parity superconducting state with a two - dimensional order parameter that transforms like a single representation , the e@xmath4 representation of the hexagonal symmetry group .",
    "this order parameter may also couple to the afm order parameter . while the spatially homogeneous superconducting states of this model and their response to an applied magnetic field have been studied , there is comparatively little work that explores the effect of spatially inhomogeneous antiferromagnetism ( siafm ) on superconductivity .",
    "motivated by recent work of garg@xcite , which concludes that spatially varying afm would rule out the two dimensional representation models for upt@xmath0 , we examine the sensitivity of an e@xmath1 superconductor to siafm through numerical calculations of its response to two qualitatively different kinds of spatial configurations of the siafm . since the free energy functionals for an e@xmath1 and an e@xmath5 superconductor are formally identical , our results are also relevant to e@xmath5 superconductors .",
    "antiferromagnetism is the prime suspect for inducing the zero - field double phase transition observed in specific heat experiments on high - quality crystals .",
    "a coupling between afm and superconducting order parameters is suggested by a downward kink in the magnitude of the modulus of the afm order parameter at the superconducting transition.@xcite in a comparison of specific heat measurements with neutron scattering experiments under pressure , hayden _ et al_.@xcite observed that the disappearance of the double transition is correlated with the disappearance of signatures of antiferromagnetism .",
    "recent work of keizer _",
    "et al._@xcite further supports this correlation . upon substituting pd for pt on a small number of sites , they find that the magnetic moment and the splitting of the double transition increase simultaneously with increasing pd doping .",
    "the nature of the antiferromagnetism is itself unusual .",
    "a signature of an afm phase transition in thermodynamic , nmr ( nuclear magnetic resonance ) , and zero - field @xmath6sr ( muon spin relaxation ) experiments has so far not been observed.@xcite this has been taken as evidence for the absence of long - range order and the existence of magnetic fluctuations on a characteristic scale smaller than neutron scattering frequencies , but greater than those of nmr .",
    "this temporal fluctuation has largely been ignored and the antiferromagnetism has been taken to be static when considering the interaction of afm with superconductivity .",
    "while conventional thermodynamic signatures of the nel temperature , @xmath7 , have not been observed , more recent transverse high - field @xmath6sr experiments have detected anomalies at @xmath7 as identified by neutron scattering.@xcite    the appearance of the double transition was unexpected .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ shdata ] , specific heat experiments@xcite prior to 1989 typically showed a single anomalously broad peak at the transition to superconductivity .",
    "an obvious explanation is that afm domains increase in size during the annealing process sharpening the distribution around two intrinsic superconducting transitions , but x - ray@xcite and neutron scattering@xcite experiments fail to show any obvious correlation between domain size and annealing .",
    "a commonly held physical picture is based on an interpretation of the neutron scattering data .",
    "the afm order with orthorhombic symmetry appears with @xmath8 ordered moments constrained to lie in the basal plane .",
    "afm order occurs in domains of uniform size @xmath9 nm , that are randomly distributed over three @xmath10 vectors that are oriented at @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 with respect to the @xmath14 axis .",
    "the moments are essentially rigidly locked to the lattice for fields in excess of the zero - temperature upper critical field of the superconducting state.@xcite    this picture is not firmly established .",
    "existing neutron scattering data is unable to rule out the possibility that instead of domains of a single-@xmath10 structure , afm order appears in a triple-@xmath10 structure that preserves the symmetry of the crystal lattice.@xcite moreover , a recent careful analysis of the neutron scattering data@xcite finds that no conclusion can be drawn from existing data on whether the staggered moment remains fixed to the lattice or whether it rotates with an applied magnetic field .",
    "existing data also can not distinguish randomly oriented abutting domains with small magnetic moments from small domains with magnetic moments of @xmath15 interspersed in an otherwise nonmagnetic system .    whether afm occurs in a few large domains with staggered moments that are free to rotate in an applied field , or whether it is strongly",
    "spatially varying with staggered moments that are rigidly fixed to the lattice , is important in determining the symmetry of the superconducting states , particularly for states near the upper transition temperature .",
    "several authors take the view that this quasistatic afm acts as a symmetry breaking field ( sbf ) and lifts the degeneracy among components of a multicomponent order parameter resulting in two superconducting phase transitions separated by @xmath16 that are observed in zero field.@xcite a two - component odd - parity order parameter that transforms like the two - dimensional @xmath17 representation of the hexagonal symmetry group d@xmath18 is one of the more promising proposals.@xcite at low temperature or in the absence of the sbf , weak coupling bcs theory shows that the homogeneous equilibrium state breaks time - reversal symmetry .",
    "further calculations using weak - coupling bcs theory show that thermal conductivity,@xcite transverse sound attenuation,@xcite and upper critical fields@xcite of this state are in good agreement with experiments for temperatures in the low temperature phase.@xcite coupling to an sbf has been included within a ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory developed for a single - domain superconducting state .",
    "signatures of a double phase transition are apparent in the specific heat and lower critical field,@xcite and in the cores of vortices.@xcite in contrast to two - dimensional even - parity e@xmath5 and e@xmath19 , and to odd - parity e@xmath20 order parameters , the e@xmath1 model can allow for a tetracritical point for arbitrary field orientations in the h - t phase diagram .",
    "an enhancement of this model includes the competition between magnetic anisotropy and zeeman energies of the magnetic order parameter,@xcite and reproduces the angular dependence of the upper critical field observed in experiment.@xcite    within the e@xmath1 model , comparatively little has been done to explore the effect of coupling superconductivity and spatially inhomogeneous afm .",
    "motivated by the quenched domain interpretation of the neutron scattering data , early work on e - representation superconductivity by joynt _",
    "et al._@xcite and by mineev@xcite focused on abutting afm domains that are uniform in size with dimensions of a superconducting coherence length and considers the possibility of a superconducting glass phase .",
    "based on a variational calculation for domains of uniform size and on calculations for a one - dimensional ` toy model ' , garg@xcite argued that the pure e - representation models are ` incompatible ' with upt@xmath0 for the small domains suggested by the neutron scattering experiments .",
    "taking the afm order to be static , we explore the sensitivity of e@xmath1 superconductivity to spatially varying afm order in two models for the ( disordered ) domain structure of the afm state : ( i ) abutting afm domains of uniform size with orientations that are equally distributed over the allowed @xmath10-vectors , and ( ii ) small domains interspersed in a homogeneous afm background .",
    "we consider these models to represent limiting cases for the configuration of the siafm .",
    "the first model corresponds to the standard interpretation of the neutron scattering data .",
    "the second model begins with uniform afm order and adds ` nanodomains ' with random position and orientation of the staggered magnetization ; this provides the broadening mechanism for the linewidth of neutron scattering data .",
    "we present numerical solutions of the gl equations in two spatial dimensions and focus on contributions to the free energy , the specific heat , and the nature of the superconducting state .",
    "our results for model i agree with those for garg s simple periodic model .",
    "while neither model provides an adequate account of experiment , our results for models i and ii differ , and taken together they _ do not _ lead to garg s conclusion that the e@xmath1 model is incompatible with upt@xmath0 . rather , they suggest that a reasonably accurate model of the spatial dependence of the afm is required to make meaningful comparisons with experiment . in a forthcoming work ,",
    "we discuss other domain configurations along with the effects of dimensionality and the possible role of superconducting glass phases.@xcite central results of this paper are contained in the comparison of specific heat calculations with experiment for both models .    in model",
    "i , the signatures of the superconducting transitions rapidly smear and broaden with decreasing domain size .",
    "the sbf introduces a convenient length scale @xmath21 ( defined below ) which , for upt@xmath0 , is some three times larger than the zero - temperature superconducting coherence length . for domain sizes of @xmath22 ,",
    "the calculated specific heat compares well with data from experiment.@xcite this homogeneous domain size model does not agree with neutron scattering experiments which , when viewed through the lens of model i , would suggest a much smaller domain size , @xmath23 . as the domain size is decreased below @xmath24 only a single superconducting transition appears in the specific heat . while the suppression of the double transition with decreasing domain size suggests an obvious explanation for the appearance of the double transition upon annealing of as - grown samples ( see fig .",
    "[ shdata ] ) , this explanation appears to be inconsistent with magnetic x - ray and neutron scattering data which are interpreted as showing no change in domain size with annealing .",
    "in contrast , model ii is not as sensitive to the density of nanodomains .",
    "specific heat signatures remain sharp even for a high density of ` nanodomains ' and resemble those for high - quality crystals .",
    "although these signatures remain sharp , for coverages larger than @xmath25% only a single superconducting transition occurs .",
    "while neither model provides an adequate account of the experimental data , the calculations presented here demonstrate the sensitivity of e@xmath1 superconductivity to siafm and suggest that a reasonably accurate description of the spatial variation of the underlying afm is crucial in drawing conclusions about the symmetry of the superconducting states .",
    "we begin by reviewing the ginzburg - landau free energy for an e@xmath1 superconductor coupled to an sbf .",
    "we take the e@xmath1 gap matrix @xmath26 to be the superconducting order parameter ; it has the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 are basis functions on the fermi surface that transform among each other under the operations of the d@xmath18 symmetry group , @xmath29 are cooper pair amplitudes that are functions of the cooper pair center of mass @xmath30 , @xmath31 is a unit vector along the c - axis of the crystal , and @xmath32 are pauli matrices in spin space .",

    "the order parameter is well developed at the transition to superconductivity .",
    "below the superconducting transition , the neutron scattering data suggests that the modulus of the staggered magnetization decreases . over the temperature range",
    "for which a gl theory of superconductivity is valid , the modulus of the staggered magnetization changes by less than @xmath51% .",
    "since this change is small , we take the staggered magnetization to be a fixed external field and neglect the effect of superconductivity on afm order.@xcite the leading contribution to the free energy from the coupling of afm and superconductivity is second order in @xmath52 and of the form @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a normalized direction vector of the staggered magnetization , and @xmath55 is a coupling constant proportional to the square of the staggered magnetization .",

    "[ sbf_grad_imps ] .",
    "the superconducting order parameter is on average aligned relative to the ( background ) afm order except in a region @xmath152 around a nanodomain .    in fig .",
    "[ central2 ] we compare our results of the specific heat with measurements on high - quality crystals . since the heat jumps are very insensitive to the density of nanodomains , a wide range of @xmath55 values and nanodomain concentrations are consistent with experiments .",
    "in particular , an sbf coupling @xmath153 requires a concentration of roughly @xmath154 in order to account for the observed sharp double transition in heat capacity measurements .    it is natural to expect that disorder will drive the lower temperature phase transition from being second order to first order or possibly a glass transition .",
    "our numerical heating and cooling cycles have shown that upon heating - up and crossing the low temperature phase transition , the entropy is always smooth and hence the transition is second order . however , when starting the cooling cycle above @xmath155 we find a glasslike , frustrated and strongly disordered solution for the order parameter , which gives rise to a discontinuity in the entropy upon crossing @xmath155 .",
    "this discontinuity is consistent with a first order transition .",
    "however , a comparison of the calculated free energies shows that the latter is energetically less favorable than the solution with a smooth transition and signals that the glasslike solution is metastable . assuming that the metastable glasslike solution is experimentally observable when rapidly cooling down",
    ", our calculations give a small latent heat @xmath156 , where @xmath6 is a numerical factor of order @xmath157 .",
    "in other words , the latent heat is a small fraction of the overall measured specific heat , @xmath158 , with @xmath159 or even less . in a carefully devised heat capacity measurement",
    "this small latent heat should be observable if indeed a glasslike phase transition occurs .",
    "we have explored the effect of spatially inhomogeneous antiferromagnetic order coupled to the superconducting order parameter of an e@xmath1 superconductor in two models representing limiting configurations of the afm order parameter : ( i ) abutting afm domains of uniform size equally distributed over the three possible orientations of the afm order parameter , and ( ii ) small domains with dimensions of the order of the superconducting coherence length ( nanodomains ) , randomly dispersed through a single afm domain .",
    "our numerical solutions of the ginzburg - landau equations show that model i is very sensitive to domain size .",
    "phase transitions are rapidly broadened and smeared as the domain size is decreased . for domain sizes",
    "less than @xmath160 only one transition is evident .",
    "the results of our calculations in two - dimensions are in qualitative agreement with those of the simple one - dimensional model of garg .",
    "in contrast , model ii shows sharp phase transitions for all nanodomain densities up to the point where the double phase transition gives way to a single phase transition .",
    "our calculations for model ii show that low - lying metastable states affect the thermodynamic properties of the system as it is cooled , and suggest the possibility that the lower transition may be weakly first order .",
    "in contrast , our calculations for model i show no evidence of a first order transition . although both models can yield sharp phase transitions like those observed in the heat capacities of high - quality samples , neither of them can account for the change in the heat capacity on annealing if the magnetic moments and domain sizes do not change as a result of annealing .",
    "the qualitative difference in the results for our two models does caution that simplistic models involving domains _ homogeneous _ in size do not rule out the possibility of e@xmath1 superconductivity in upt@xmath0 .",
    "the relative insensitivity of the low temperature time - reversal symmetry breaking phases to siafm in both models provides a natural explanation of how an e@xmath1 superconductor can provide a good description of the gap structure of upt@xmath0 at low temperature and therefore transport properties that are in good agreement with experiment . in the temperature region that includes the two phase transitions ,",
    "model i appears to be too sensitive to siafm while model ii is perhaps not sensitive enough .",
    "it is , thus , more likely that siafm is not arranged in abutting domains of uniform size , but rather , there is a distribution of afm domain sizes peaked around a particular size .",
    "further calculations are required to properly consider this possibility , which we examine in forthcoming work .",
