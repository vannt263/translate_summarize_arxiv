    "we are interested in the limit of many particles per well and a mean - field description of the ultracold bose gas in terms of a single condensate wave function @xmath0 @xcite . instead of a direct numerical determination of the wave function as the ground state solution of the gross - pitaevskii equation , however , we aim at a largely analytical approach with a path intergral description as our starting point .",

    "it is very remarkable that our feynman path integral variational approach leads to the same ground state energy as a purely gaussian trail wave function .",
