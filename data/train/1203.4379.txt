    "the structural properties of excited @xmath2 states in deformed even - even nuclei have been the subject of a long controversy . according to the geometric model of bohr and mottelson  @xcite , a nucleus with an elipsoidal equilibrium shape may undergo oscillations of two different types , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the first type of vibration preserves axial symmetry while the second allows excursions toward triaxial shapes .",
    "these vibrations should be combined with rotations exhibited by the deformed , vibrating nucleus to yield a rotation - vibration spectrum .",
    "the geometric model of bohr and mottelson , therefore , predicts an axially deformed nucleus to display a spectrum of rotational bands built on top of vibrational excitations .",
    "the lowest in energy is the ground - state rotational band with @xmath5 ( _ i.e. _ , of which the projection of the angular momentum on the axis of symmetry is zero ) which corresponds to no intrinsic excitation .",
    "next in energy are the @xmath3- and @xmath4-vibrational bands which correspond to one intrinsic excitation of the @xmath3 or @xmath4 type , characterized by a rotational band with @xmath5 or @xmath6 , respectively . at higher energies still",
    ", the geometric model predicts rotational bands built on multiple excitations of @xmath3 and/or @xmath4 phonons .",
    "while @xmath4-vibrational bands are an acknowledged feature of deformed nuclei , such is not the case for @xmath3-vibrational bands .",
    "confusion arises because excited @xmath2 states in nuclei can be of many different characters , such as pairing isomers  @xcite , two - quasi - particle excitations  @xcite , or so - called intruder states that arise through the mechanism of shape coexistence  @xcite .",
    "a careful analysis of the observed properties of excited @xmath2 states seems to indicate that very few indeed satisfy all criteria proper to a @xmath3-vibrational state  @xcite . in particular , although this observation is obfuscated by a lack of reliable data , very few @xmath2 states decay to the ground state by way of an electric monopole transition of sizable strength  @xcite , as should be the case for a @xmath3 vibration  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that alternative interpretations of excited @xmath2 states in deformed nuclei , either as pairing isomers  ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite ) or through shape coexistence and configuration mixing ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite ) have gained advocates over recent years .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to examine to what extent a purely collective interpretation of nuclear @xmath2 levels is capable of yielding a coherent and consistent description of observed charge radii and electric monopole transitions  @xcite . as noted above",
    ", very few measured electric monopole transitions satisfy the criteria proper to a matrix element from the ground - state to the @xmath3-vibrational band and the present attempt therefore might seem doomed to failure .",
    "however , collective excitations of nuclei can also be described with the interacting boson model ( ibm ) of arima and iachello  @xcite , where they are modeled in terms of a constant number of @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( and sometimes @xmath9 ) bosons which can be thought of as correlated pairs of nucleons occupying valence shell - model orbits coupled to angular momentum @xmath10 and 2 ( and 4 ) , respectively .",
    "one of the advantages of the ibm is that a connection with the shell model  @xcite as well as with the geometric model  @xcite has been established .",
    "in particular , one of its dynamical symmetries , the su(3 ) limit  @xcite , displays energies reminiscent of the rotation - vibration spectrum of the geometric model .",
    "it has also been shown , however , that the first - excited @xmath2 state in the su(3 ) limit of the ibm has not exactly a @xmath3-vibrational character but is a complicated mixture of intrinsic @xmath3 and @xmath4 vibrations  @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to show that a collective interpretation of excited @xmath2 states with the ibm is not inconsistent with the electric monopole data , as observed in the rare - earth region .    the outline of this paper as follows . in sect .",

    "electric monopole ( e0 ) transitions between nuclear levels proceed mainly by internal conversion with no transfer of angular momentum to the ejected electron .",
    "if the energy of the transition is greater than @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 is the mass of the electron ) , they can occur via electron - positron pair creation . a less probable de - excitation mode which can proceed via an e0 transition is two - photon emission .",
    "it is not _ a priori _ clear why a connection exists between charge radii and e0 transitions .",
    "in fact , the argument is rather convoluted and we begin this section by recalling it .",
    "the argument can be generalized to effective operators , leading to a relation between charge radii and e0 transitions which forms the basis of the present study .      the total probability for an e0 transition between initial and final states @xmath13 and @xmath14 can be written as the product of an electronic factor @xmath15 and a nuclear factor @xmath16 , the latter being equal to  @xcite @xmath17    \\label{e_rhoi}\\ ] ] with @xmath18 and where the summation runs over the @xmath19 protons ( @xmath20 ) in the nucleus .",
    "the coefficient @xmath21 depends on the assumed nuclear charge distribution but in any reasonable case it is smaller than 0.1 . the second term in eq .",
    "( [ e_rhoi ] ) therefore can be neglected if the leading term is not too small  @xcite . in this approximation",
    "we have @xmath22    on the other hand , the mean - square charge radius of a state @xmath23 is given by @xmath24 this is an appropriate expression insofar that a realistic @xmath25-body wave function is used for the state @xmath23 . for the heavy nuclei considered here",
    "the construction of such realistic wave function is difficult and recourse to an effective charge radius operator @xmath26 should be taken . in particular ,",

    "the generalization of the expression  ( [ e_r2a ] ) can therefore be written as @xmath28 where the first summation runs over all @xmath25 nucleons while the second and third summations run over neutrons ( @xmath29 ) and protons ( @xmath20 ) only , and where @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) is the effective neutron ( proton ) charge . if bare nucleon charges are taken ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 )",

    "this endeavor is difficult in the context of the nuclear shell model because realistic wave functions , appropriate for the calculation of @xmath27 or e0 matrix elements , are hard to come by for heavy nuclei . as an alternative we propose here to test the implied correlation with the use of a simpler model , namely the ibm  @xcite",
