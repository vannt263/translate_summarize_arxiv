    "our present knowledge of the low energy hadronic spectra and the properties thereof is based on the premise that chiral symmetry is a good approximate symmetry of the underlying quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) lagrangian .",
    "this has found verification time and again in understanding the nature of the low - lying octet of pseudoscalar mesons in particular .",
    "calculational methods have been developed primarily in two complementary directions .",
    "on the one hand , the current algebra tools of the 1960 s @xcite plus the two sum rules of weinberg @xcite attempt to address the properties of the qcd lagrangian _ per se _ in the perturbative regime . on the other , the chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) approach @xcite , which is based on an effective lagrangian that only contains mesonic degrees of freedom , addresses the low - energy non - perturbative regime of qcd .",
    "the latter approach introduces terms into this lagrangian in an expansion in momenta .",
    "the unknown coefficients of these terms in each order of the expansion , which in the two flavor case amount to ten in total , have to be fixed by experimentally measurable quantities .    an effective model approach of describing the low energy sector _ ab initio _ in terms of quark degrees of freedom has also been studied for some years now in the so - called nambu ",
    "jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite . in its original two flavor formulation ,",
    "the minimal version of this model contains scalar and pseudoscalar fields in a chirally symmetric combination , and the model only has three parameters : the ( strong ) coupling @xmath9 , an averaged current quark mass @xmath10 , and a cutoff @xmath11 that sets the scale of the theory .",
    "mesons are constructed as collective excitations within this model , and the goldstone theorem is fulfilled in the chiral limit .",
    "the spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry leads to a dynamically generated quark mass .",
    "in addition , it can easily be demonstrated within the framework of this model that the goldberger - treiman and gell - mann  oakes  renner relations are fulfilled , and that the quark axial current is conserved .",
    "in addition , dashen s theorem @xcite that prevents a chiral neutral pion from acquiring a mass shift in the presence of an electromagnetic field , also continues to be obeyed @xcite .",
    "these properties , which are a consequence of chiral symmetry , continue to hold in an extended version of the njl model or enjl model , as we will abbreviate it @xcite . in this extended model , the vector and axial vector degrees of freedom",
    "are explicitly included , and an additional ( strong ) coupling strength @xmath12 is required in order to couple these modes into the lagrangian .",
    "it is imperative in demonstrating that the expected properties of chiral symmetry hold , that a suitable regularization scheme be employed under which the relevant ward identities continue to hold @xcite .",
    "the primary purpose of this paper is to investigate the sum rules of both the weinberg type @xcite and also those introduced by gasser and leutwyler @xcite .",
    "these sum rules involve , _ inter alia _ the vector as well as axial vector spectral densities , and thus it appears necessary in regarding a quark model , to have such degrees of freedom explicitly supported .",
    "hence our interest in using the enjl model for this purpose .",
    "however , the application of this model to this problem is fraught with difficulties . on the one hand",
    ", the identification of the vector and axial vector meson modes with the physical @xmath13 and @xmath14 mesons is especially problematic , and we will return to comment on their analysis somewhat later on in this introduction .",
    "we turn first rather to the issue of the spectral functions themselves .",
    "we note that either version of the njl model constitutes an effective field theory that does not confine the explicit quark degrees of freedom that it contains .",
    "consequently one expects the strength distributions of the meson spectra , which contain interacting quark - antiquark pairs , to behave unphysically in the high energy domain .",
    "this domain is naturally important if the sum rules are to work .",
    "however , in spite of these deficiencies , one can show explicitly @xcite that under the pauli - villars ( pv ) regularization of the amplitudes , weinberg s first sum rule @xmath15 is obeyed exactly , while the second one satisfies a modified equation , @xmath16 both statements hold to leading order in the number of colors . here",
    "@xmath7 is the pion decay constant , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the quark mass and scalar quark condensate in the ground state .",
    "these conclusions also hold for the minimal version of the njl model .",
    "this is perhaps all the more surprizing , since the minimal version does not support either vector mode as a fundamental excitation , so that it contains no resonance structures of any kind in these channels .    besides the two weinberg sum rules , we are able to demonstrate that the six additional sum rules introduced by gasser and leutwyler are also obeyed by the spectral densities of the enjl model",
    ". however , these results come at a price : as pointed out in @xcite , for example , the pauli - villars regularization procedure effectively introduces additional spinor fields that may correspond to indefinite metric sectors of the hilbert space . in the present case",
    ", the use of the pv procedure leads to negative and therefore unphysical spectral densities at large momentum transfers .",
    "however , this occurs in such a fashion as to give an overall result that is in accordance with the sum rule .",
    "we thus interpret the , perhaps unexpected , continued validity of the sum rules under these circumstances as a consequence of the underlying chiral symmetry and its faithful representation in the pauli - villars regularization method .",
    "the results obtained from the enjl model fall naturally under scrutiny with regard to their accordance or lack thereof with chiral perturbation theory .",
    "the retention of the sum rules in both approaches suggests that there could be considerable overlap in these results .",
    "in fact , the enjl model provides a dynamical basis for calculating the empirical gasser - leutwyler coupling constants of chiral perturbation theory .",
    "we evaluate these constants in both the njl and enjl models , and express them as far as possible in terms of the physically measurable parameters @xmath7 and @xmath19 , the quark axial form factor .",
    "one finds that one additional physically non - measurable quantity , the ( constituent ) quark mass @xmath17 , also occurs in these expressions , giving them this single parameter dependence .",
    "however , since the calculations of all quantities within the enjl model have only been performed to leading order @xmath20 in the number of colors , one has to identify the calculated coefficients with the gasser - leutwyler constants with some care .",
    "the reason for this is that the physically meaningful scale - independent constants @xmath0 of gasser and leutwyler are not well - defined in the chiral limit , where they diverge logarithmically with vanishing pion mass .",
    "this comes about due to the appearance of chiral logarithms in chpt that are to be anticipated on general grounds @xcite . in either version of the njl model ,",
    "such chiral logarithms appear as a part of the @xmath21 non - chiral corrections that necessarily include mesons in intermediate states @xcite .",
    "thus we must identify the coefficients obtained from the model calculations with the @xmath22 @xmath23 s of gasser and leutwyler , that have a well - defined chiral limit , and not directly with the @xmath0 as is commonly done ( see @xcite and further references cited therein ) .",
    "we do this here . in this way",
    ", predictions can be obtained for the combinations @xmath24 here the mass @xmath25 is a scale parameter introduced via the dimensional regularization of the chiral perturbation theory amplitudes @xcite .",
    "one can explicitly validate this approach @xcite : the coefficients that have been evaluated to @xmath20 in either version of the njl model are finite in the chiral limit , and acquire chiral logarithms ( at the scale @xmath26 of the @xmath27 meson mass ) upon incorporating the meson loops .",
    "the results obtained in this manner are in reasonable agreement with the known empirical values of the @xmath28 s , after including the logarithm as shown .",
    "as already noted , this agreement , however , depends explicitly on the calculated value of the dynamically generated quark mass as obtained from the gap equation .",
    "an important exception to this remark is the result for the electric polarizability , @xmath29 , of charged pions .",
    "this coefficient can be obtained directly from holstein s sum rule @xcite in conjunction with the enjl expressions for the spectral densities and the pion radius .",
    "one obtains the simple form @xmath30 where @xmath31 , and the other symbols have their usual meanings .",
    "this is an extremely interesting result for several reasons .",
    "firstly it coincides exactly in form with the chpt expression for the polarizability in terms of the @xmath0 to one - loop order@xcite .",
    "secondly , the terms coming from the dynamically generated quark mass @xmath17 cancel exactly in the difference @xmath32 , leading to a result that _ only contains physical constants_. thirdly , only the axial meson degree of freedom contributes to the polarizability through @xmath19 ; there is no contribution from the @xmath13 meson .",
    "fourthly , since @xmath33 , this establishes a _ parameter free _ prediction for the upper limit on the enjl value of @xmath2 , at least to @xmath34 . using the estimated value @xmath35",
    ", one has the numerical result , @xmath36@xmath4 .",
    "this answer can be compared directly with the prediction @xcite of chiral perturbation theory to one - loop order , @xmath37@xmath4 , that uses the empirical values of the @xmath38 s .",
    "experimentally , the value of @xmath2 is still very uncertain .",
    "current analysis of the available data gives values of @xmath2 ranging between @xmath39 to @xmath40 @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "one can also evaluate the current algebra result of das _",
    "@xcite for the electromagnetic splitting of the charged to neutral pion masses using the enjl spectral densities .",
    "_ formula links the splitting @xmath41 to a modified sum rule for the spectral density difference @xmath42 , integrated over all momentum transfers of the virtual photons that are responsible for the electromagnetic self - energy of the pion . the resulting enjl expression for this mass squared difference",
    "can be written in the compact form @xcite @xmath43 where the @xmath44 are pion and quark form factors that are defined in section ii of the main text .",
    "the special assumption that the form factors in eq .",
    "( [ e : introdeltam ] ) describe point - like mesons without internal structure , leads to the result originally derived by das _",
    "et al._. further evaluation of this expression is postponed to section iv .",
    "there we also give the set of gauge invariant pion polarization diagrams to @xmath34 that corresponds to this result .",
    "the electromagnetic gauge invariance of the mass difference expression is thereby made explicit .    as has been alluded to in an earlier part of the introduction ,",
    "the determination and interpretation of the vector and axial vector excitation modes that are supported by the enjl model is not straightforward , but remain essential ingredients for the construction of the spectral densities .",
    "we have therefore investigated these modes anew .",
    "the particular innate difficulty in these calculations arises from the fact that both the @xmath13 meson and the axial vector meson @xmath14 have empirical masses that lie _ above _ the @xmath45 threshold for free quark pair creation , a non - physical process from the point of view of confinement .",
    "the existence of this threshold means that the complex plane for the momentum transfer variable squared @xmath46 has a unitarity cut along @xmath47 .",
    "accordingly the enjl model masses have to be sought as the poles of the relevant meson propagators that have been continued through this cut onto the contiguous or `` second '' riemann sheet",
    ".    taken at face value , these facts seem to make a model of this nature of dubious value for the vector modes .",
    "in fact , the situation is far more complicated than this .",
    "a careful analysis of the vector polarization shows that this function has _ two _ isolated poles on the second sheet for our parameter choice : one on the real axis below @xmath45 , and a second complex pole in the lower half plane of that sheet .",
    "the real pole corresponds to a @xmath13 mode containing _ virtually _ bound @xmath48 pairs of the vector plus axial vector terms in the lagrangian causes this mode to move through the branch cut onto the physical sheet , to become a true bound state for the model @xmath13 meson . ] .",
    "the @xmath13 spectral density function receives contributions from both of these poles .",
    "a single pole approximation to describe the resonance behavior of the vector strength in terms of a single mass plus a width parameter is thus incomplete . while this density still displays a single - peak structure that can be placed around the observed physical @xmath49 mass for an appropriate choice of parameters , the extent to which the virtual state strength intrudes into the energy domain of the peak is parameter - dependent .",
    "thus one can not unambiguously associate the position of the peak with the mass squared of the @xmath13 meson as being given by either the virtual bound state pole , or the real part of the complex pole .",
    "we give full details of this problem in section iii .",
    "as such , the interpretation of the @xmath13 meson , like the @xmath50 meson , differs vastly from the conventional view of being simply a bound state of two constituents .",
    "note in passing that , simply taken on its own , the @xmath13 meson is of considerable interest currently , given its special role in the interpretations of the observed excess in the lepton spectra in heavy - ion collisions in the intermediate mass range @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the axial vector polarization displays a single complex pole in the lower half plane of the second sheet , and the axial vector spectral density has a single peak structure that can be associated with this pole .",
    "the positions of peaks in both the vector and the axial vector spectral functions are basically controlled by the vector coupling strength @xmath12 . while the value of this coupling can be fixed via @xmath19 at @xmath51gev@xmath52 [ from eq .",
    "( [ e : axialg ] ) ] , plus the known value of @xmath53mev and an assumed value for @xmath54 , the actual peak positions are fairly robust against moderate changes in @xmath12 . taking the resulting peaks to define the @xmath55 and @xmath56 meson masses , one obtains @xmath57mev , @xmath58mev for the vector masses of the enjl model , to be compared with the observed masses of @xmath59mev and @xmath60mev @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the predicted ratio @xmath61 for the above value of @xmath12 is remarkably close to the original weinberg estimate @xcite of exactly @xmath62 .",
    "the values for the model masses are satisfactory from an experimental point of view .",
    "one thus has to try to reconcile these results with the fact that neither spectral function contains its dominant physical decay channel , @xmath63 or @xmath64 respectively , but rather describes the ( hypothetical ) @xmath65 or @xmath66 decays allowed by the non - confining enjl lagrangian .",
    "this is a long - recognised deficiency @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the model spectral densities continue to saturate the first sum rule , eq .",
    "( [ e : introw1 ] ) . from these facts",
    "alone , one can argue with some justification that the positions of the peaks in these distributions are more significant than the particular manner in which they decay , and therefore do lead to meaningful masses .",
    "one should recall in this regard that , in weinberg s original discussion of the problem , the vector meson mass ratio was determined by using delta function distributions for the vector densities that ignored all decay channels , but with strengths that allowed the sum rules to be satisfied .",
    "more generally , the fact that both weinberg s and gasser and leutwyler s sum rules are satisfied by the model spectral density functions in spite of their undesirable decay properties , suggests that results based on integrals over these densities do nevertheless have physical significance .",
    "an analysis of the enjl model commences with the construction of the irreducible polarizations that are now coupled in the isovector pseudoscalar and longitudinal axial channels .",
    "this is done in section ii .",
    "we are not the first authors to carry out such an analysis ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "hence this section is in the nature of a summary of those aspects of the problem that are necessary for an understanding of the sum rules , and it also serves to set our notation . from a knowledge of the irreducible polarization functions , the new meson propagators in the extended model can be constructed .",
    "this is done in such a fashion that the generalization from the njl model becomes obvious , and so that the njl results are simply recovered on setting @xmath12 to zero .",
    "central to the derivations is that , as far as possible , quantities are expressed in terms of physical variables , the pion decay constants @xmath7 and the pion quark coupling strength , @xmath67 , in the enjl model .",
    "one observes that these quantities undergo a simple multiplicative scaling @xmath68 and @xmath69 via the quark axial form factor @xmath19 with respect to their njl values @xmath70 and @xmath71 in such a way as to preserve the chiral theorems , like the goldberger - treiman relation .",
    "in fact , apart from such scaling , the main effect of including the vector and axial vector degrees of freedom is to drastically redistribute the associated njl spectral densities into two peaks that serve to determine the masses of these modes in the model .",
    "conservation of the axial vector current can also be demonstrated explicitly .",
    "here one finds that the enjl model leads to non - trivial vector and axial form factors @xmath72 and @xmath73 for the quark currents such that @xmath74 , but @xmath75 .",
    "there is of couse an overriding @xmath76 on all of these statements : the issue of regularization .",
    "in addition to being non - confining , the njl model and its enjl extension are both non - renormalizable .",
    "thus a cutoff @xmath11 in their mass spectra is necessary in order to obtain finite answers .",
    "one anticipates that the magnitude of this cutoff will be similar for either version of the model , but this parameter has in any event to be of order of the chiral symmetry - breaking scale @xmath77gev of qcd .",
    "otherwise the njl lagrangian could not reasonably fulfill the role of a low energy effective model theory .",
    "however the problem is more complicated than this .",
    "one has to also ensure that the regularization scheme employed respects the chiral ward identities satisfied by those amplitudes that express the consequences of the chiral symmetry of this model lagrangian .",
    "the pauli - villars regularization scheme @xcite fulfulls these requirements @xcite : in particular , it preserves those chiral ward identities between regulated amplitudes that are necessary for a demonstration of the sum rules - model , for example , can be found in @xcite . ] .",
    "we take up the pv regularization of the polarization amplitudes in some detail in appendix a. there we show that the pv scheme can be implemented in conjunction with either unsubtracted , or once - subtracted dispersion relations that lead , not surprizingly , to a very different asymptotic behavior of the polarization amplitude in question .",
    "this feature has a direct bearing on the ability of the associated spectral density , which is given by the imaginary part of the polarization , to satisfy the sum rules .",
    "the spectral density functions carrying specific quantum numbers are next introduced in section iii with the aid of the appropriate current - current correlators and the kllen - lehman spectral representation .",
    "we establish the analytic properties of the polarization functions .",
    "then we analyse the analytic behavior of their corresponding spectral density functions under pv - regularization , and show by means of contour integration techniques that all eight sum rules , the two of weinberg , and the six of gasser and leutwyler , are obeyed by enjl spectral densities regulated in this manner .",
    "the only exceptions that occur are for the zero - moment sum rules , like in eq .",
    "( [ e : introw2 ] ) , where a finite value instead of zero appears on the right hand side .",
    "we use these results in conjunction with the non - chiral expansions for the physical pion mass and decay constant of section ii to identify several of the coupling parameters of chiral perturbation theory . in parallel with these developments",
    ", we also explore the analytic properties of polarization amplitudes that have been obtained from once - subtracted dispersion relations prior to regularization .",
    "such amplitudes are shown to give rise to landau ghost poles at space - like @xmath78 in the @xmath50 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 channels . some of the consequences of nevertheless admitting such unphysical propagators are briefly discussed .    in section iv , we discuss the use of enjl spectral densities in conjunction with sum rules to compute two electromagnetic properties of the pion : the electric polarizability coefficient of the charged pion from holstein s sum rule @xcite , and the @xmath79 mass splitting from the current algebra sum rule of das , guralnik , mathur , low and young @xcite .",
    "we also provide an alternative derivation of the mass splitting in terms of feynman diagrams that leads to exactly the same result .",
    "an explicit demonstration of how dashen s theorem is satisfied by the enjl model electromagnetic self - energies for the neutral pion is also given .",
    "a summary of results and conclusions is presented in section v , while appendix a contains additional calculational details of a more technical nature that do not appear in the main text .",
    "since the properties of nambu - jona - lasinio type lagrangians have already been the subject of extensive analysis in the recent literature @xcite , we use this section to briefly summarize only those aspects that will be required as background for the specific developments to follow in sections iii and iv .      in this section",
    ", we discuss the two - point correlation functions from which the spectral densities we wish to study are obtained .",
    "since the calculational procedure is the same for all spectral densities , let us denote by @xmath80 a generic operator with @xmath81 isospin and lorentz indices summarized by the index @xmath82 .",
    "then the associated time - ordered two - point correlators , or polarization functions , are given by @xmath83 in momentum space , where @xmath84 is the usual time - ordering operator .",
    "these currents are assumed to be bilinear forms of the two - flavor quark fields @xmath85 and their dirac adjoints , i.e. @xmath86 where the vertex @xmath87 characterizes the nature of the excitation . using the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite , the bilinear forms @xmath88 for isospin currents @xmath89 are @xmath90 with @xmath91 , @xmath92 being the @xmath81 pauli isospin matrices .",
    "the spin , parity and charge conjugation quantum numbers @xmath93 of the excitations they lead to relative to the invariant vacuum , as well as representative low - lying meson states that carry these quantum numbers , are also indicated .",
    "in addition to these isospin currents , it is useful to consider the isoscalar densities @xmath94 the factor of @xmath95 that is included in eq .",
    "( [ e : isovec ] ) in the definition of the vector and axial vector currents is purely convention .",
    "if we further assume that the dynamics of these quark currents are governed by a two - flavor @xmath96 chirally symmetric lagrangian of the nambu - jona - lasinio type , then both the vector and the axial vector ( noether ) currents will be conserved .",
    "if this is the case , then the lorentz and and isospin structure of the expression ( [ e : jjgen ] ) is known ahead of time .",
    "if we write @xmath97 where @xmath98 is given by either @xmath99 or @xmath100 , then both correlation functions become purely transverse tensors in their lorentz indices and diagonal in their isospin indices , i.e. @xmath101 where @xmath102 with @xmath103 . in a similar fashion ,",
    "the scalar and pseudoscalar two - point functions have the structure @xmath104 where @xmath80 is given by either @xmath105 or @xmath106 for the isovector currents , or by @xmath107 or @xmath108 for the isoscalar densities . in the latter case",
    ", there is no isospin factor .",

    "( [ e : jj ] ) to compensate for the factor @xmath95 carried in eq .",
    "( [ e : isovec ] ) in the current definition .",
    "it is important to bear in mind that the transverse form given by eq .",
    "( [ e : conserved ] ) holds in the first place for the exact vector or axial vector polarization in a chirally symmetric theory , and therefore must also hold for any approximate calculation of either function .",
    "therefore any approximate treatment has to be implemented in such a manner that current conservation is maintained at each level of approximation : otherwise the physical consequences of the symmetries contained in the lagrangian could become distorted .",
    "a case in point that is discussed again below is the mixing of the @xmath111 axial vector and pseudoscalar pion modes already at the lowest order of approximation in the minimal njl model that is necessary to ensure axial current conservation in the chiral limit @xcite .      in order to calculate the two - point correlation functions , we need to specify the lagrangian @xmath112 governing their dynamics . for this purpose",

    "one knows this from a direct estimate @xcite of the up - down current quark mass difference contribution @xmath832 to @xmath772 , and from a rather general discussion given in @xcite for the mixing effects .",
    "bearing these results in mind , one is led to regard the mass of the charged pion , and especially the @xmath79 mass difference , as an essentially electromagnetic phenomenon .",
    "in this paper , we have established that the two sum rules of weinberg for massless qcd , plus the six sum rules introduced by gasser and leutwyler in connection with chiral perturbation theory , are all obeyed by spectral densities that are generated by the nambu - jona - lasinio model lagrangian in its minimal , as well as in its extended form , and which includes vector and axial vector degrees of freedom .",

    "( [ e : enjlw2 ] ) , ( [ e : gl5p ] ) and ( [ e : gl6p ] ) ] that acquire a finite value proportional to the quark condensate density that represents the order parameter of the model .",
    "we suggest that this finding might perhaps be an example of a more general feature of any chiral hamiltonian that energetically favors a chirally broken groundstate with a finite quark condensate .",
    "the njl model in either form is both non - renormalizable and non - confining .",
    "thus the statements regarding sum rules are subject to stating what sort of regularization precedure has been followed .",
    "we show in particular that the sum rules hold for spectral densities computed from polarization amplitudes which have been regulated according to the pauli - villars prescription .",
    "as might be anticipated , the pv - scheme introduces an unphysical behavior into the spectral densities at high energies , where these densities become negative instead of remaining positive definite .",
    "nevertheless this happens in such a way that the sum rules continue to be saturated .",
    "we interpret this rather surprizing conclusion to be a consequence of the underlying chiral symmetry properties of the lagrangian and its faithful representation under the pv - scheme . as a corrollary to this statement",
    ", we find that the violation , due to pv - regularization , of the positive definite nature of the model densities becomes less and less important for the sum rules involving higher and higher inverse moments , such as the sum rule determining the pion polarizability , for example .    while the sum rules alluded to above also hold for the spectral densities belonging to the minimal njl model that does not contain any explicit vector meson modes , this is perhaps less interesting from the point of view of physical applications .",
    "the sum rules involve _ inter alia _ explicit reference to both vector and axial vector densities , and so it is of direct physical interest to consider such degrees of freedom explicitly . with this in mind",
    ", we have revisited the problem of incoporating these modes into the njl model in order to determine the behavior of the associated spectral densities and their masses .",
    "the basic effects of these modes are ( a ) to renormalize the pion decay constant and @xmath180 coupling constant in a complementary fashion such that the goldberger - treiman relation is retained , and ( b ) to concentrate the vector and axial vector strengths of the one - loop spectral densities of the minimal njl model into two well - defined peaks at low energies that lie just above the @xmath125 continuum threshold .",
    "this redistribution of strength takes place in such a way , however , that all the sum rules continue to be obeyed .",
    "if the positions of these peaks are taken to define the @xmath13 and @xmath14 meson masses of the enjl model , their numerical positions are found to be in qualitative accord with the experimental masses of the physical @xmath13 and @xmath14 mesons , suggesting that this identification has physical meaning .",
    "we have combined the sum rules techniques developed in this paper , together with other calculated information to identify enjl expressions for the empirical coupling constants introduced by gasser and leutwyler into chiral perturbation theory , to evaluate the current algebra expression of das",

    "for the charged to neutral electromagnetic mass splitting of the pion , and to compute the charged pion s polarizability from holstein s sum rule . in extracting the coupling constants of chiral perturbation theory , it has been borne in mind that the physically relevant scale - invariant constants , @xmath0 , are not well - defined in the chiral limit because of the chiral logarithms they contain . however , the combination @xmath1 is well - defined , being proportional to the renormalized @xmath23 of gasser and leutwyler , and it is this combination that one can extract from the enjl model .",
    "in fact , it is possible to go further and extract the @xmath0 s themselves due to the following circumstance .",
    "one can show that the leading order non - chiral corrections to the enjl amplitudes are precisely in the form of chiral logarithms that occur with the correct coefficients to reproduce the combination given above ( at the scale of the sigma meson mass of the model ) .",
    "the appearance of the correct chiral logarithm has been demonstrated explicitly for the case of @xmath386 , for example , which must be identified from a calculation of the pion radius .",

    "we also showed that the limiting value of @xmath2 quoted above is reduced by @xmath837 , the quark axial form factor squared , in the presence of axial vector mesons accompanying the pion .",
    "such meson clouds lead to a less polarizable system : for @xmath54 , one finds @xmath838 @xmath4 that is nicely bracketed by the chiral perturbation theory and qcd sum rule predictions .",
    "by contrast , the @xmath13 mesons do not change the pion polarization at all .",
    "their contributions cancel out completely , in complete agreement with the findings of holstein @xcite , who employed delta function spectral densities together with weinberg s vector meson mass relation and the ksrf relation .",
    "finally we must caution that the the limiting value on @xmath2 quoted above is subject to a multiplicative correction of the form @xmath839 $ ] where the additional modifications arise from neglected non - chiral effects of @xmath840 in the sum rule itself , and neglected chiral corrections of @xmath383 in the evaluation of the spectral densities that enter the sum rule .",

    "<S> we show that , under pauli - villars regularization of the meson polarization amplitudes that determine the spectral density functions , all of the sum rules involving inverse moments higher than zero are automatically obeyed by the model spectral densities . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , the zero moment sum rules acquire a non - vanishing right hand side that is proportional to the quark condensate density of the non - perturbative groundstate . </S>",
    "<S> we use selected sum rules in conjunction with other calculations to obtain explicit expressions for the scale - independent coupling constants @xmath0 of chiral perturbation theory in the combination @xmath1 , to evaluate the das - guralnik - mathur - low - young current algebra expression for the electromagnetic mass difference of the pion , and to compute the pion electrical polarizability @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the sum rule calculations set an upper limit of @xmath3@xmath4 on this quantity , that is independent of the quark mass up to @xmath5 , and _ only _ depends on the fundamental constants : pion mass @xmath6 and pion decay constant @xmath7 , in addition to fine structure constant @xmath8 .    </S>",
