    "the possibility of that relevant features of the dynamics of a system could be obtained from the differential geometric structure of the probabilities distributions gave place to the first encounter between differential geometry and probability theory . in this sense ,",
    "geometrization of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics constituted the most important achievement in the subject with several approaches like the obtained by means of the internal energy as considered weinhold @xcite , or the ruppeiner metric given by the second moments of thermodynamical fluctuations @xcite , among others .",
    "with the same riemannian character of these approaches , another formulations based in the thermodynamic of parameters were established in the field of the statistical mechanics like the foundational works of rao @xcite and amari @xcite , and also given by ingarden @xcite , janiszek @xcite .",
    "the successful application of all this vast body of approaches in characterizing several phenomena , such as the phase transitions and their critical points in non ideal gases , gave them entity to constitute a discipline within the information theory , called _ information geometry_. curved statistical manifolds are the subject of study of the information geometry , and they have associated the fisher  rao metric @xcite which in turn is linked to the concepts of entropy and fisher information .",
    "generalized extensions of the information geometry @xcite with regard to nonextensive formulation of statistical mechanics @xcite has been also considered .",
    "the utility of information geometry is not only limited to thermodynamics and statistical mechanics .",
    "for instance , it has been applied in quantum mechanics leading a quantum generalization of the fisher metric @xcite , and recently also in nuclear plasmas @xcite . in particular ,",
    "an application of information geometry to chaos can be performed by considering complexity on curved manifolds @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "asymptotic expressions for information measures are obtained by means of geodesic equations leading to a _ criterion _ for characterizing global chaos on statistical manifolds @xcite : the more negative is the curvature , the more chaotic is the dynamics . as usual , chaos can be characterized in terms of diverging initially nearby trajectories @xcite . for the statistical models this condition results in the divergence of geodesic paths on the statistical manifold and constitutes a local criterion for chaos .",
    "besides , in dynamical systems theory , the _ ergodic hierarchy _ ( eh ) characterizes the chaotic behavior in terms of a type of correlation between subsets of the phase space @xcite . in the asymptotic limit of large times ,",
    "the eh establishes that the dynamics is more chaotic when the correlation decays faster . according to correlation decay , the four levels of eh are , from the weakest to the strongest : ergodic , mixing , kolmogorov , and bernoulli .",
    "in particular , in mixing systems any two subsets enough separated in time can be considered as  statistically independent \" which allows one to use a statistical description of the behavior of the system . in quantum chaos ,",
    "the statistical independence is present in the universal statistical properties of energy levels which are given by the gaussian ensembles @xcite . in gaussian ensembles theory",
    "one assumes that in a fully chaotic quantum system the interactions are neglected in such way that the hamiltonian matrix elements can be considered statistically independent @xcite .",
    "related to this , in @xcite a quantum extension of the eh was proposed , called the _ quantum ergodic hierarchy _ , which allowed to provide a characterization of the chaotic behaviors of the casati ",
    "prosen model @xcite and the kicked rotator @xcite .",
    "inspired by the characterizations of quantum chaotic systems made in @xcite and making use of curved statistical models , we propose a generalization of the ergodic , mixing and bernoulli levels of the eh in the context of the information geometry , which we called _ information geometric ergodic hierarchy _ ( igeh ) . in order to use it ,",
    "we define a distinguishability measure for a @xmath1 correlated model that allows us to give an upper bound for the correlation of igeh .",
    "moreover , considering hamiltonian systems belonging to the canonical ensemble we also give a method for characterizing their dynamics in terms of the statistical parameters and the levels of the igeh .    in this way ,",
    "our main contribution is two  fold : 1 ) an intimately connection between statistical models and probability distributions of the canonical ensemble which allows one to geometrize the phase transitions , and 2 ) an information geometric version of the ergodic hierarchy as an alternative framework for studying the chaotic dynamics in curved statistical models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec prelim ] , we give the notions and concepts of information geometry used throughout the paper , along with brief description of a @xmath1 correlated model . in section",
    "[ sec eh ] , we make a brief review of the levels the ergodic hierarchy .",
    "section [ sec igeh ] is devoted to an information geometric definition of the ergodic hierarchy by expressing the correlations in terms of probability distributions instead of subsets of phase space .",
    "next , in section [ sec 2dmeasure ] we define a distinguishability measure for the @xmath1 correlated model and an upper bound for the correlation of the igeh is given . in section [ sec geometrical canonical ]",
    ", we establish the connection between the statistical models and the family of probability distributions belonging to the canonical ensemble .",
    "for quadratic hamiltonian systems we show that their associated statistical models are the multivariate gaussian ones , for which we obtain a closed form of the determinant of the covariance matrix in terms of the hessian of the hamiltonian . here",
    "we also give an upper bound for the ig correlation where the temperature of the heat bath is considered as an external parameter .",
    "in section [ sec relevance ] , we illustrate the formalism with two examples : a pair of interacting harmonic oscillators presenting phase transitions in the canonical ensemble and the @xmath2 gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) .",
    "also , a panoramic outlook of the igeh is sketched .",
    "finally , in section [ sec conclusions ] we draw some conclusions , and future research directions are outlined .",
    "we begin by introducing some fundamentals and concepts , following the definitions given in @xcite .      given an abstract set @xmath3",
    "one can consider the set @xmath4 of all the probability density functions ( pdfs ) @xmath5 defined on @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the set of real numbers and the integration must be replaced by a sum when @xmath3 is discrete . consider a subset @xmath8 such that each element of @xmath9 may be parameterized using a @xmath10real vector @xmath11 so that @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a subset of @xmath14",
    ". then , if the mapping @xmath15 is injective it is said that @xmath9 is a _ statistical model _ on @xmath3 .",
    "the dimension of the statistical model is that of the macrospace , i.e. it is @xmath10dimensional .",
    "the physical interpretation of @xmath3 and @xmath13 is as follows .",
    "generally , @xmath3 represents the microscopic variables of the system under study which typically are difficult to control , for instance the positions of all the particles in a gas .",
    "thus , @xmath3 is called the _ microspace _ and @xmath16 are the microvariables . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath13 represent the macroscopic variables that can be measured in an experiment , like the mean value or the moments of the microvariables .",
    "it is said that @xmath13 is the _",
    "macrospace _ and @xmath17 are the macrovariables .",
    "since the microspace is fixed by the system then one can only choose the macrospace , and in this way the statistical model is established .",
    "then , the statistical models are system  specific , from which follows that a statistical model could be useful for a system while that for another not .      next step is to describe the behavior of a system by means of a previously and adequately chosen , statistical model . for this , some kind of dynamics must be introduced on the statistical model . in information geometry",
    "this is accomplished by means of the fisher  rao tensor @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a generic element of @xmath9 .",
    "the metric tensor @xmath20 endows the dynamics to the macrospace in terms of the geodesic equations for the macrovariables @xmath21 , i.e. @xmath9 results to be a statistical manifold .",
    "more precisely , @xmath9 is a riemmanian manifold and the statistical character is due to the elements of @xmath9 are probability distributions .",
    "thus , the main goal of the statistical models is to obtain some relevant information about the dynamics by means of the geodesic equations and geometrical quantities like the ricci tensor , the scalar curvature etc . in this sense , we will use a criteria given by cafaro et al .",
    "@xcite to characterize global chaos on statistical models : _  the more negative is the scalar curvature , the more chaotic is the dynamics\"_. from the metric tensor one can obtain the geodesic equations for the macrovariales @xmath17 along with the following geometrical quantities that we will use throughout the paper . @xmath22",
    "@xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 where the comma in the subindexes denotes the partial derivative operation ( of first and second orders ) , @xmath27 is the inverse of @xmath20 , and @xmath28 is a parameter that characterizes the geodesic curves .",
    "most statistical models used in the literature are the so called _ gaussian models _ , due to its wide versatility for describing multiple phenomena .",
    "this models are obtained by choosing the subfamily @xmath9 as the set of multivariate gaussian distributions .",
    "if @xmath29 are the microvariables and there is no correlations between them then @xmath30 are the set of macrovariables , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 correspond to the mean value and the variance of the @xmath33th microvariable . however , for a more realistic description of the system the correlations between each of the microvariables must be taken into account . considering the family of bivariate ( binormal ) distributions ,",

    "the microspace is @xmath39 and the macrospace is @xmath40 .",
    "nevertheless , one still can obtain a non trivial description by adding the following _ macroscopic constraint _",
    "@xmath41 where @xmath42 is a constant belonging to @xmath43 .",

    "physically , @xmath42 resembles the minimum uncertainty relation when one chooses @xmath16 as the position of a particle and @xmath36 its conjugate variable .",
    "moreover , this interpretation allows to give an explanation of the phenomenon of  suppression of classical chaos by quantization \" from an information geometric point of view @xcite . for the sake of simplicity one also can fix the mean value @xmath45 of @xmath36 as zero . with the help of",
    "then one can rewrite , thus obtaining the non  trivial correlated statistical model of lower dimensionality @xmath46\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we renamed @xmath47 as @xmath48 .",
    "this is the so called _ the @xmath1 correlated model _",

    " one can obtain the fisher tensor along with the following geometrical quantities .",
    "@xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 from one can see that the curvature has a minimum value @xmath55 when @xmath56 ( absence of correlations ) while for @xmath57 ( maximally correlated case ) it has a maximum value @xmath58 . in terms of the criterium of global chaos",
    "this can be interpreted as : the dynamics of the uncorrelated case is more chaotic than the corresponding to the maximally correlated case .",
    "moreover , the divergence of the metric observed for @xmath57 expresses the maximally correlated case as a critical point of the dynamics .",
    "in classical chaos , the exponential instability implies continuous spectrum , and therefore , a decay of correlations in such a way that for large times the measure of the intersection between two sets of phase space ( separated from each other in time ) tends to the product of their measures .",
    "this is the well known _ mixing _ property , and constitutes one of the foundations of the statistical mechanics .",
    "the main feature of mixing is that it establishes the statistical independence of different parts of a trajectory , when sufficiently separated in time .",
    "this is the main reason for the application of probability theory in the classical domain , which allows one to calculate statistical features such as diffusion , relaxation and distribution functions @xcite .",
    "consequently , the description in terms of trajectories can be replaced by an equivalent one in terms of distribution functions , which , if not singular , represent not a single trajectory but a continuum of them .    in ergodic theory , any classical system",
    "is represented mathematically by a dynamical system @xmath59",

    "the ergodic hierarchy ranks the chaos of a dynamical system according to a type of correlation @xmath62 between two subsets @xmath63 and @xmath64 of @xmath3 that are separated by a time @xmath65 .",

    "since only the kinetic energy has the dependence on @xmath196 and @xmath197 then this equivalent to consider a sort of marginal probability distribution with respect to the potential energy , i.e. @xmath198 with the help of one can express the potential energy as @xmath199 then , from and one has @xmath200 which is nothing but the probability distribution of the @xmath1 correlated model by means of the identifications @xmath201 from the last line of one obtains @xmath202 let us show that this equation is a particular case of the formula : since the determinant of the covariance matrix is @xmath203 and the determinant of the hessian of the potential energy evaluated at @xmath204 is + @xmath205 then one can replace both expressions in with @xmath206 , thus obtaining @xmath207 with the help of one can recast this equation as @xmath208 from which one obtains @xmath209 .",
    "considering the temperature @xmath137 as an external parameter one can study the phase transitions of the system as @xmath137 varies .",
    "also , we set the reference temperature @xmath191 as the room temperature . given that the parameter @xmath28 is arbitrary , we choose @xmath28 as @xmath210 this choice for @xmath28 is convenient since one has @xmath211 in this way , the asymptotic limit @xmath126 is identified with the limit @xmath212 , and therefore , the transition towards high temperatures can be studied by means of the limit @xmath126 .",
    "this transition express the behavior of the correlations between the oscillators when the bath temperature pass from a finite value ( which is lower than @xmath191 ) to the room temperature .",
    "physically , at the room temperature is expected that if the energy @xmath213 delivered by the bath to each oscillator is larger than the energies of them ( i.e. , @xmath214 ) then as a result of the thermal agitation the correlations between the oscillators tend to be canceled .",
    "indeed , from one can see that @xmath125 when @xmath212 .",
    "now let us see that this phase transition is characterized in terms of the mixing level of the igeh .",
    "when @xmath37 is vanishingly small , the following approximations hold : @xmath215 using these approximations , and neglecting terms of order @xmath216 , in the formula of @xmath122 one obtains that @xmath217 holds for @xmath218 . replacing this inequality in one has that latexmath:[\\ ] ] so the critical points of @xmath264 satisfy @xmath269 replacing in one has the value of @xmath264 in its critical points @xmath270 @xmath271 in order to find explicitly @xmath272 one must solve the second relation of the eq .",
