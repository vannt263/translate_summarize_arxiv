    "recent advances in dna nano - fabrication technology ( see @xcite ) have led to the constructions of multi - pedal walking molecular devices .",
    "the first was a bipedal object @xcite walking on a one - dimensional path by dna set strands with nucleic acid domains complementary to molecular imprints on the device legs and the substrate . since then , several other similar bipedal dna walkers have been synthesized ( see @xcite and a review @xcite ) .",
    "a different molecular design has been implemented in @xcite .",
    "the resulting objects , known as molecular spiders , usually have many legs . each leg ( a short single strand of dna )",
    "can bind to the substrate through the watson - crick base pair formation .",
    "a bound leg can either detach from the substrate without modifying it , or it can catalyze the cleavage of the substrate creating two product strands . the lower product remains bound to the surface , while the upper product is free to float away in solution .",
    "there is a residual binding of the leg to the remaining product , but it is weaker than the leg - substrate binding . utilizing the effect of the spider s motion on the molecular tracks it is possible to design environments where molecular spiders demonstrate some basic robotic behaviors @xcite .",
    "when a spider is released on a surface coated with oligonucleotide substrates , it can cleave thousands of substrates before eventually detaching .",
    "the small size of spiders makes experimental observation of their motion very challenging .",
    "atomic force microscopy imaging and single - molecule fluorescence studies have been successful to a certain degree @xcite , yet neither the details of the spider s gait nor the individual paths of spiders have been resolved with sufficient certainty .",
    "perspectives and challenges of the experimental work are surveyed in @xcite .",
    "a number of modeling studies describing the motion of molecular spiders have been recently carried out .",
    "the motion of a single spider on a one - dimensional track has been investigated in refs .",
    "the first article @xcite ignores the difference between the substrate and the product and makes a number of simplifying assumptions about the gait of the spiders .",
    "there are no limitations on the number of legs , however .",
    "the chief result of ref .",
    "@xcite is that the spider ( which is a complicated self - interacting multi - leg object ) can be replaced by a particle characterized by a single number , the diffusion coefficient ; for the simplest gaits , the diffusion coefficient was analytically computed . in @xcite",
    "we mainly considered bipedal spiders , but took into account that spiders affect the substrate ( turn it into products ) . despite the non - markovian nature of the problem ,",
    "the coarse - grained behavior turned out to be surprisingly simple , namely the difference in residence times on the substrate and the product leads to the effective bias into the unvisited region .",
    "recent papers @xcite utilized more detailed and complicated models mimicking the gait of spiders moving on one - dimensional tracks , the possibility of the detachment , etc .",
    "these studies numerically confirm the tendency of spiders to move into the unvisited region leaving behind the trail of the product .",
    "this key feature was observed experimentally @xcite and proved theoretically @xcite in the realm of simple models .",
    "an interesting new feature noticed in @xcite is the emergence of a super - diffusive growth of the mean - square displacement , @xmath0 with @xmath1 , which holds on a surprisingly long time span ; eventually , the super - diffusive growth crosses over to the diffusive growth .",
    "several rigorous results concerning the asymptotic behaviors ( limit theorems , transience , recurrence , and rate of escape ) of molecular spiders have been established in @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite the motion of spiders in random environments has been studied .",
    "as in our previous work @xcite , throughout this paper we will assume an idealized gait  the goal is not to mimic the complicated ( and poorly known ) gait of molecular spiders , but to qualitatively understand spiders macroscopic characteristics in the realm of simple models @xcite .",
    "previous theoretical analyses @xcite have been focused on the motion of molecular spiders on one - dimensional tracks , while the goal of this work is to study a single spider moving on a two - dimensional lattice .",
    "if not stated otherwise , we tacitly assume that the rate of attachment greatly exceeds the rate of detachment . in this case , the relative time when one leg is detached ( this situation is illustrated on fig .",
    "[ twodim_ill ] ) is negligible and hence the possibility that two or more legs are detached simultaneously can be disregarded .    ) .",
    "as long as this constraint is obeyed , each leg can hop to the empty ( not occupied by another leg ) nearest neighboring site .",
    "as long as the rate of leg attachment greatly exceeds the rate of leg detachment , all legs are attached most of the time and for relatively short time intervals one of the leg is detached as illustrated above . ]    the following properties of molecular spiders will _ always _ be assumed :    * * hopping * : when a leg detaches , it re - attaches to a _ neighboring _ site . * * exclusion * : two legs can not be attached to the same site . *",
    "* constraint * : the distance between _ any _ two legs does not exceed a certain maximal span .    the restriction to the nearest neighbor hopping can be relaxed ( long - distance gaits have been probed in the one - dimensional setting @xcite ) ; the exclusion is of course the fundamental feature .",
    "the last property is the simplest constraint that assures the compactness of the spider . for one - dimensional spiders",
    "several types of constraint were considered , and the diffusion coefficients of these spiders were exactly obtained in most cases , due to mappings to exclusion processes @xcite .",
    "the two - dimensional case is particularly important in current experiments .",
    "the actual situation is rather complicated , e.g. , in some experiments there are a few layers of the substrate and hence a quasi two - dimensional setting seems more appropriate ; additionally , the substrates do not form a perfect square lattice .",
    "nevertheless , we shall assume that a spider with aforementioned simple gait is placed on a square lattice @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the constraint regarding the separations between the legs roughly describes real molecular spiders .",
    "one realization of the constraint which is convenient for the numerical implementation defines the distance between points @xmath2 and @xmath3 via @xmath4 .",
    "the neighborhood in this metric is geometrically a square , and it is often called the von neumann neighborhood . for example",
    ", the simplest `` von neumann '' spider is the bipedal spider with legs separated by distance @xmath5 at most .",
    "there are four possible configurations : horizontal , vertical , and two diagonal @xmath6 where @xmath7 represents a leg , and @xmath8 an empty site .",
    "we found that the diffusion coefficient @xcite of this spider is equal to @xmath9 .",
    "generally von neumann spiders are more amenable to analysis , and we study them as well as more realistic euclidean spiders .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ von ] is devoted to von neumann spiders . in sec .",
    "[ bi ] we present main results for bipedal euclidean spiders ; the detailed derivations are given in the appendix .",
    "an analysis of molecular spiders simplifies when the maximal span increases and in sec .",
    "[ manyleg ] we describe corresponding asymptotic behaviors . in the following sections we relax some of the assumptions about the spider gait , the influence of the spider s motion on the environment , etc . in sec .",
    "[ memory ] we consider the influence of memory .",
    "we model the difference between the product and the substrate by postulating that the leg spends ( on average ) more time at newly visited sites , i.e. , on the substrates .",
    "this slowdown in comparison with the motion on the products leads to faster ( covering more unvisited sites ) spiders ; the reason for this phenomenon is an effective bias towards unvisited sites .",
    "this behavior has been observed and explained in one dimension @xcite , and it continues to hold in two dimensions . in sec .  [ binding ] we investigate what happens when the attachment rate is finite .",
    "we compute the mean time the spider spends on the surface and show that the probability to remain attached decays exponentially if the attachment rate greatly exceeds the detachment rate .",
    "we summarize our findings in sec .",
    "a spider is quantified by lattice points @xmath10 with @xmath11 which describe the positions of its legs .",
    "we assume that the spider has maximal span @xmath12 , so the distance between any two legs is @xmath13 .",
    "each leg , when allowed , hops to neighboring sites ( up , down , left , or right ) at rate 1 in each direction . in this section",
    "we use the metric which assigns the distance between any two legs @xmath14 and @xmath15 according to the rule @xmath16 in this metric , the neighborhood around the origin , i.e. the disk @xmath17 , is the square in euclidean metric [ see the example in ] ; such a neighborhood is often called the von neumann neighborhood .    a spider with maximal span @xmath12 between the legs should therefore occupy the square with @xmath18 lattice sites ; after shifting , this square becomes @xmath19 this spider can therefore have at most @xmath18 legs . only spiders with @xmath20 legs are mobile .",
    "more precisely , spiders with more legs than the above upper limit , @xmath21 , have a few legs which can move , but each such spider forever remains within its surrounding square , provided that we ignore multiple legs being detached simultaneously .",
    "let us first calculate the total number of possible configurations of the legs .",
    "to avoid multiple counting of configurations which are obtained by translation , we use the convention that there must be a leg both in the bottom row ( @xmath22 ) and in the leftmost column ( @xmath23 ) , as in the example in . with this convention",
    "the total number of configurations is @xmath24 to establish let us ignore for a moment the aforementioned convention restricting the position of one leg .",
    "the number of such unrestricted configurations of a spider with @xmath25 legs inside the @xmath26 rectangular is equal to @xmath27 . to obtain @xmath28",
    "we take the number of configurations without restriction @xmath29 , subtract the number of configurations without a leg in the bottom row @xmath30 or in the leftmost column @xmath31 , and then add the number of configurations without a leg in both the bottom row and the leftmost column @xmath32 , since we subtracted it twice .",
    "this leads to .",
    "we are interested in the properties of the center of mass of the legs @xmath33 due to the symmetry of the hopping rules , the mean position of the spider does not change @xmath34 , and we are interested in the variance @xmath35 of the center of mass .      here",
    "we show that the bipedal spider with arbitrary maximal span @xmath12 has the diffusion coefficient @xmath36 the bipedal spider with @xmath5 corresponds to the bipedal spider with @xmath37 in the euclidean version , and from we indeed recover the already known result @xmath38 .",
    "to derive we start by noticing that bipedal spiders are  completely symmetric \" : in each configuration the spider hops at the same rate in each direction .",
    "for completely symmetric spiders on the square lattice , a remarkably simple formula @xmath39 for the mean - square of the center of mass , and respectively for the diffusion coefficient of the spider , was established in @xcite . in eq .",
    "we denote by @xmath40 the total rate the spider hops which is averaged over all stationary states . in general , for spiders with any number of legs and with symmetric hopping rates ,",
    "the transitions between any two connected configurations occur at the same rates and hence all configurations have the same stationary probability @xmath41 .",
    "therefore the total rate which is averaged over all stationary states , in short the stationary average rate , is equal to @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the total hopping rate from configuration @xmath44 .",
    "consequently , can be rewritten as @xmath45 ( note that for the symmetric random walk on the square lattice @xmath46 and @xmath47 , hence the diffusion coefficient is one . )",
    "let us first calculate the average hoping rate to a given arbitrary direction , say to the right .",
    "notice that in most configurations both legs can jump to the right , but in some , only one of them .",
    "it is easier to enumerate the number of these later configurations , which is where one leg is blocked and can not hop to the right .",
    "there is only one configuration where the two legs are next to each other in the same row @xmath48 , due to the convention that a leg is needed both in the bottom row and the leftmost column . in this configuration",
    "only the right leg can hop to the right .",
    "there are @xmath49 configurations where one leg is in the bottom left corner @xmath50 , and the other is at maximal distance @xmath51 , hence only the left leg can hop to the right .",
    "there are further @xmath12 configurations where the right leg can not hop : one leg is in the bottom right corner @xmath52 , and the other leg is in the leftmost column , and in row @xmath53 .",
    "hence all together there are @xmath54 configurations where only one leg can hop to the right , and @xmath55 where both can . now using the fact that the average rate is the same for all four directions",
    ", equation leads to @xmath56}{{\\cal c } } = 2 - \\frac{1}{s}\\ ] ] where we have taken into account that the number of configurations for bipedal spiders is @xmath57 , as it follows from .",
    "substituting into we arrive at the diffusion coefficient .",
    "it is much more challenging to compute the diffusion coefficient for multi - leg spiders .",
    "the chief reason is that spiders with more than two legs are not completely symmetric and hence one can not use . to show the lack of symmetry it suffices to provide a configuration where the left and right hopping rates of the spider are different . consider for example a tripod with two legs being in the same column and the third leg being at the maximal distance @xmath12 in the @xmath58 direction from both of the other legs , as illustrated here @xmath59 this spider can hop to the right at rate two and to the left at rate one .",
    "( more precisely , both legs on the left can hop to the right , but not to the left ; the leg on the right can hop to the left , but not to the right . )",
    "similar configurations can be easily constructed for any spiders with @xmath60 legs .",
    "the matrix method described in ref .",
    "@xcite can be generalized to arbitrary dimension and in principle it allows one to analytically determine the diffusion coefficient for any spiders with sufficiently small number of legs .",
    "however , even in the simplest examples the exact calculations are rather cumbersome . for instance , even for the simplest @xmath61 tripod on the square lattice the number of configurations is equal to 48 [ see eq .",
    "] , so the computation of @xmath62 leads to the necessity to diagonalize a @xmath63 matrix ; obtaining this matrix is very laborious .",
    "we performed simulations for the simplest spiders to measure their diffusion coefficients .",
    "this quantity is relatively easy to measure by probing the asymptotic of the mean - square displacement .",
    "it turns out that the correction to the true asymptotic decays is rather small , namely , @xmath64 for multi - pedal spiders .",
    "( similar corrections were observed in one dimension . )",
    "note that there are no corrections at all for continuous time random walks ( the mono - pedal spiders ) .",
    "the measured values of @xmath62 are summarized in table [ dtab ] .",
    "to detect the motion of a single spider is still experimentally impossible , while various techniques allow one to count the total number of visited sites @xcite .",
    "since numerous spiders are usually released @xcite , dividing the actually observed total number of visited sites by the number of spiders makes the _ mean _ number of sites visited by a spider accessible . in the limit when the density of spiders is very low , the same result will emerge if we take a single spider and average the number of different visited sites over many realizations .    for a symmetric random walk which hops at rate one in each direction ( so its diffusion coefficient is @xmath65 ) ,",
    "the mean number of different sites visited by the random walk scales as @xcite @xmath66\\ ] ] in the large time limit .",
    "the amplitudes are @xmath67 and @xmath68 where @xmath69 denotes euler s constant .",

    "@xcite , the random walk with diffusion coefficient @xmath38 has been analyzed ; to recast the prediction of @xcite to our setting , where @xmath65 , we rescaled time by a factor 4 . )",
    "we simulated the motion of different spiders and we obtained the same asymptotic behavior , with @xmath70 and @xmath71 depending on the number of legs @xmath25 , and the constraint @xmath12 .",
    "we are mainly interested in the leading order behavior @xmath70 , however , fitting also the next correction @xmath71 is unavoidable in order to get an estimate for @xmath70 , due to the large sub - leading corrections .",
    "the results for the coefficient @xmath70 are summarized in table [ atab ] .",
    "one can see from tables [ dtab ] and [ atab ] that , according to simulations , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are monotonically decreasing functions of @xmath25 , and monotonically increasing functions of @xmath12 for multi - pedal spiders .",
    "the simplest conjecture is that asymptotically the spider is indistinguishable from the random walk on the square lattice .",
    "mathematically , this would imply that @xmath74 .",
    "simulation results for the diffusion coefficient show that @xmath70 is slightly different than that .",
    ".simulation results for the diffusion coefficients @xmath62 for spiders with @xmath25 legs and constraint @xmath12 . for the random walk ( @xmath46 )",

    "we can re - write @xmath77 as @xmath78 now let us examine the increment of @xmath77 that occurs when new configurations are born .",
    "a direct counting gives      plugging ( [ linear])([knight ] ) into ( [ phi ] ) we find that @xmath80 thus @xmath77 increases by 1/2 when a pair of linear configurations are born and does not change when configurations of other types are added .",
    "this explains why @xmath77 is half - integer and why the jumps in @xmath77 occur when @xmath81 passes the integer value .",
