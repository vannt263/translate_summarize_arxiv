    "in the last decade eub@xmath0 with its interesting and still not fully understood magnetic and electronic properties has attracted considerable interest . for low temperatures",
    "it is a ferromagnetic semimetal becoming a paramagnetic semiconductor for higher temperatures .",
    "it crystallizes in the cubic cab@xmath0 structure ( spacegroup 221 , pm3 m ) .",
    "the divalent europium ions occupy the corners of the cubic unit cell and at the body centered position sits an octahedron consisting of six boron atoms .",
    "the lattice constant a=4.19 does not change with temperature .",
    "@xcite    eub@xmath0 exhibits two consecutive phase transitions at t@xmath1=12.5k and t@xmath2=15.5k .",
    "@xcite t@xmath1 is the bulk curie temperature .",
    "the magnetization follows a brillouin function and the saturation value is 7@xmath3 due to the exactly half - filled 4f shell in europium.@xcite nonetheless there are evidences of phase separation above t@xmath1 up to 30k @xcite , where bound magnetic polarons @xcite are responsible for the cusplike peak in resistivity and the colossal magnetoresistance at t@xmath2 . @xcite",
    "concomitant with the bulk magnetic phase transition at t@xmath1 is a transition from semimetal to semiconductor .",
    "@xcite    for low temperatures the semimetallic behavior is proven theoretically and experimentally",
    ". early local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite as well as recent band structure calculations in lda+u @xcite show an overlap of valence and conduction band around the x - point of the brillouin zone .",
    "shubnikov - de haas and de haas - van alphen measurements @xcite agree with that picture as they report electron and hole pockets on the fermi surface at the x - point .",
    "the carrier density is about 0.01 per unit cell for low and 0.001 for higher temperatures .",
    "@xcite due to the known lack of correct predictions of band gaps in the lda the authors in [ suggest eub@xmath0 to be halfmetallic in the ferromagnetically ordered phase . that scenario is not ruled out by experiments albeit",
    "not proven also .",
    "the resistivity shows a strong peak at t@xmath2 and also indicates a metal - insulator transition . up to t@xmath1 and t@xmath2 an increase of the carrier concentration ,",
    "a reduction of the effective mass or a combination of both is responsible for a strong red shift of the plasma frequency.@xcite the specific electronic properties seem to stem from temperature dependent changes of valence and conduction bands induced by the ferromagnetic alignment of the local moments .",
    "the other way around the ferromagnetism is attributed to an rkky mechanism where the itinerant carriers are responsible for the magnetic exchange .",
    "it looks as if the system will be best described by the two band kondo lattice model introduced in the next section .    similar models but with focus on other properties of eub@xmath0",
    "are already studied in a mean - field treatment @xcite and in dynamical mean - field theory .",
    "@xcite the spin polaron model @xcite explains the behavior in resistivity and the colossal magnetoresistance effect around t@xmath2 .",
    "this paper will focus on the range from zero temperature to t@xmath1 where the magnetic and metallic phase transitions take place .",
    "for modeling eub@xmath0 we will use the kondo - lattice model , @xcite also known as s - f model .",
    "the spins of the localized 4f electrons result in a local magnetic moment which interacts with the spin of the itinerant electrons in the valence(v ) and conduction(c ) band , respectively .",
    "the complete two - band hamiltonian in second quantization is@xmath4 the first term in ( [ eq : h2band ] ) describes the kinetic part of the electrons in band b with the hopping integrals t@xmath5 between two lattice sites @xmath6 and @xmath7 that are connected to the wave vector @xmath8 dependent bloch energies @xmath9 via fourier transformation @xmath10 .",
    "the chemical potential is @xmath11 and @xmath12 the creation ( annihilation ) operator of an electron with spin @xmath13 at lattice site @xmath7 in band b.    the second term in ( [ eq : h2band ] ) describes the s - f interaction between the itinerant band electrons and the local moments @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 are the pauli matrices and j@xmath16 the coupling constants .",
    "in contrast to the kinetic part the interaction term does not need to be diagonal in band indices . it might be possible that during the s - f interaction the itinerant electron in band b hops to the other band b. that possibility is included in ( [ eq : h2band ] ) .    in eub@xmath0",
    "the valence band is formed from boron 2p and europium 4f states and the conduction band from boron 2p and europium 5d states which overlap at the x - point @xcite .",
    "the possible interband transitions are negligible by symmetry reasons",
    ".    therefore we will set j@xmath16 diagonal , resulting in the following hamiltonian @xmath17 h@xmath18 is the kinetic term for band b @xmath19 h@xmath20 describes the s - f interaction for band b @xmath21 where we used @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 . the first term in ( [ eq : hsf ] ) describes an ising - like interaction and the second the spin - flip processes .",
    "the coupling constant j@xmath25 is positive ( ferromagnetic alignment ) for the conduction band electrons and negative ( anti - ferromagnetic alignment ) for the valence band electrons@xcite .",
    "we assume the same magnitude j for both bands , hence j@xmath26=-j and j@xmath27=j .",
    "it goes without saying , that the k - independent coupling constant is an oversimplification .",
    "however , this is unavoidable due to mathematical difficulties .",
    "we are mainly interested in the single electron green function@xmath28 from which all electronic properties can be calculated .",
    "the operator @xmath29 is the creation ( annihilation ) operator in k - space . to derive the green function we solve the equation of motion@xmath30_{-};a_{b{\\mathbf}{k}\\sigma}^{\\dagger}{\\rangle \\ !",

    "* it is possible to apply the interpolation formula for the self - energy given in [ which is valid for low densities ( e@xmath340 ) and covers the following exactly solvable special cases :    * zero - bandwidth limit ( @xmath35 * ferromagnetically saturated semiconductor + ( @xmath36=s , e=0 ) * second order perturbation theory in j * high energy expansion    the resulting self - energy is@xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the free propagator .",
    "the magnetization @xmath36 will be calculated via the brillouin function which is in agreement with the measurements in [ .",
    "since the * valence band * is almost completely filled , let us change for one moment from the electronic picture to a hole like quasiparticle picture .",
    "such a hole corresponds to a missing electron in an otherwise completely filled valence band . to keep the negative coupling constant for the electrons in the valence band , the coupling constant for the holes must have opposite sign ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the self energy for the holes in the low density approximation ( h@xmath340 ) from [ then reads@xmath42 returning to the electron picture through reversing the spin ( @xmath43 ) , the self energy for the electrons in the almost completely filled valence band then is@xmath44 in fact this self - energy covers the above mentioned special cases for full bands .",
    "now we can put the selfenergies for both bands , ( [ eq : selfenergycondband ] ) and ( [ eq : selfenergyvalband ] ) in ( [ eq : greenfunction ] ) and calculate the greenfunction .",
    "as described in the previous section we are able to calculate the one electron green function with the given self energies for both bands . in this section",
    "our results are presented .",
    "the band index will be skipped as it should be clear that the following calculations are formal equivalent for both bands .",
    "several free parameters need to be adapted .",
    "the spin is s=@xmath45 due to the exactly half filled 4f shell of europium and the coupling constant j=0.2ev is in accordance with current literature .",
    "we assume a modified tight binding dispersion @xmath46 for simple cubic@xcite with the band gap located at the x - point instead of @xmath47.@xmath48 here t@xmath49 is the band s center of gravity and w the bandwidth .",
    "the widths of the tight binding bands are crucial for our model calculation since the effective coupling strength is @xmath50 the mean values of the anisotropic effective masses m@xmath51 given in [ are 1.2m@xmath52 and 0.35m@xmath52 for valence and conduction band , respectively . from",
    "that we can calculate the corresponding bandwidths@xmath53 which leads to w@xmath26=2.2ev and w@xmath27=7.4ev and is in agreement with the approximated widths from the band structure calculations for the hexaborids@xcite . in accordance with the measured band gap for the non - magnetic ( j=0 ) cab@xmath0 in [ we assume an intrinsic gap of @xmath54=0.25ev .",
    "the chemical potential is determined to result in compensated electrons and holes since the intrinsic band structure is semiconducting .      figure [ cap : dos ] shows the quasiparticle density of states ( q - dos ) for the electrons in the valence and conduction band at different temperatures ( 0k , @xmath55t@xmath1 , t@xmath1 ) @xmath56 since js@xmath57w we are in the weak coupling regime , although the effective coupling strength @xmath58 is different for conduction and valence band which leads to different results .    for the * conduction band *",
    "the q - dos is shifted with magnetization in a mean - field like manner by @xmath59 .",
    "even so one can see an overall band broadening with decreasing magnetization .    for the * valence band *",
    "some correlation effects are visible .",
    "at t=0k the spin down band is rigidly shifted by @xmath60js .",
    "since the local moments are completely aligned no spin exchange is possible for spin down electrons ( keep the anti - ferromagnetic coupling in mind ) hence there is no deformation of that band . in the spin up channel",
    "one sees a dip between two overlapping subbands .",
    "the lower subband describes electrons which flip their spin during the interaction with the local spin system , emitting a magnon .",
    "thus their lifetime is decreased .",
    "the upper subband is connected to a stable quasiparticle known as magnetic polaron which propagates through the lattice dressed by a virtual cloud of magnons ( for more details see [ ) .    at higher temperatures",
    "the scattering for both spin orientations becomes more likely , explaining the deformation of the q - dos in both spin channels . with decreasing magnetization ( increasing temperature ) the difference between the up and down spectrum decreases and vanishes at t@xmath1 due to the missing alignment of the local moments .",
    "what is also shown in figure [ cap : dos ] is a transition from halfmetallic to semiconducting behavior undergoing the magnetic phase transition .",
    "the overlap of the spin up bands at 0k is 0.5ev and the gap between valence and conduction band at t@xmath1 is 0.04ev .",
    "the band gap at t@xmath1 is in accordance with tunnel experiments@xcite .    with a mean - field treatment of the hamiltonian one",
    "could also show the halfmetal to semiconductor transition .",
    "the tight binding dispersion would be shifted rigidly by @xmath59 , resulting in an overlap at t=0k of 0.45ev for spin up and the band gap at t@xmath1 of 0.25ev .",
    "the smaller band gap within our approach results from the interaction between the electrons and the local moments even above t@xmath1 .",
    "although the net magnetization at t@xmath1 is zero , the statistically distributed magnetic moments influence the electronic structure which results in the band broadening . in a meanfield treatment",
    "the interaction is simply switched off at t@xmath1 .",
    "the spectral density @xmath61 can be compared directly with angle and spin resolved ( inverse ) photo emission experiments .",
    "figure [ cap : spectral - density ] shows the spectral density at @xmath47=(0,0,0 ) for a spin down quasiparticle in the valence band at different temperatures .",
    "as explained in the previous section , at zero temperature the spin down electron in the valence band can not exchange its spin with the local moments because they are fully aligned .",
    "thus the quasiparticle has infinite lifetime .",
    "that fact is visualized in figure [ cap : spectral - density ] as a sharp peak for t=0k .",
    "for higher temperatures and less magnetic ordering , magnons are excited and can be absorbed by the spin down electron in the valence band .",
    "therefore the lifetime is decreased with temperature which is represented by the wide peaks in figure [ cap : spectral - density ] .",
    "that evaluation of the spectral density could be done for every k - point . in figure",
    "[ cap : band - structure ] we show the spectral density as grayscale along the standard symmetry points in the brillouin zone , which makes a temperature dependent band structure .",
    "the same effects we noticed in the q - dos ( fig .",
    "[ cap : dos ] ) can be seen in the density plots ( fig .",
    "[ cap : band - structure ] ) .",
    "the spin up conduction band and spin down valence band is undeformed and rigidly shifted , represented by the thin lines .",
    "the smearing occurs where spin flip scattering is possible .",
    "for example in the plot for spin up quasiparticles in the valence band at t=0k ( fig .",
    "[ cap : band - structure ] , top right , lower band ) we can distinguish between an undeformed , sharp region around the x - point and a blurred region .",
    "these are connected to the two subbands mentioned in the previous section .",
    "the lower one describes quasiparticles that are involved in spin flip scattering , their lifetime is decreased .",
    "whereas for quasiparticles in the upper subband no real spin flip processes are possible because there are no states in the corresponding spin down region .",
    "their lifetime is infinite .    at higher temperatures the spin flip processes are possible for spin up and down .",
    "it occurs especially in the flat regions of the dispersion where the possibility of scattering is enhanced due to the smaller velocity .    along the @xmath62 direction",
    "occurs a band splitting approaching t@xmath1 . in a photo emission experiment",
    "it would be difficult to resolve the light shaded regions in figure [ cap : spectral - density ] because of the short lifetime of the quasiparticles .",
    "therefore one might wonder about two bands coming from @xmath47 and r which do not fit together .",
    "they can be explained with our many - body theory of the interaction between the electrons and the local moments .",
    "the effects in the conduction band are less pronounced due to the weaker effective coupling .",
    "nevertheless one can see that the lines get smeared with temperature due to the interaction .",
    "now we will show the qualitative behavior of the effective mass , occupation number and plasma frequency .",
    "that can be compared directly with the experiments and will be a measure whether our kondo lattice model is able to explain some of the properties of eub@xmath0 .    via the partial derivative of the real part of the self energy r@xmath63 with respect to the resonance energies",
    "@xmath64 it is possible to derive the effective mass of the quasi - particles@xmath65 the effective mass at the x - point for a spin up quasiparticle in the conduction band is shown in figure [ cap : mass ] ( dashed line ) .",
    "one can see a slight increase with increasing temperature .",
    "that is in qualitative agreement with the experimental results in [ and [ .",
    "the occupation number can be computed by    @xmath66    where @xmath67 is the fermi function ( k@xmath68 is the boltzmann constant ) .",
    "figure [ cap : mass ] ( straight line ) shows the occupation number for spin up quasi - particles versus temperature . in the previous section",
    "the decreasing band overlap with temperature due to the reduced magnetization was introduced .",
    "this is why the occupation number decreases dramatically by an order of magnitude .",
    "this agrees with the hall data in [ .",
    "figure [ cap : plasma ] shows the calculated plasma frequency versus temperature @xmath69 with the electric charge e and the dielectric constant @xmath70 .",
    "the reduction of free carriers and the increasing effective mass with increasing temperature lead to a red shift of the plasma frequency .",
    "that is in excellent agreement with magneto optical results in [ .",
    "as already mentioned we derive half metallic behavior in the whole ferromagnetic regime . to clarify that , figure [ cap : gap ] shows the shrinking band overlap for spin up ( straight line ) and the gap for spin down quasiparticles ( dashed line ) versus temperature . at zero temperature",
    "the spin up bands overlap by 0.5ev and the spin down bands are separated by 0.9ev . with decreasing magnetization the spin up and down bands",
    "are shifted and merge at the curie temperature , resulting in a band gap of 0.04ev at t@xmath1 .",
    "starting from the two band kondo lattice hamiltonian with opposite sign of the coupling constants for valence and conduction band electrons we were able to reproduce the metal - insulator transition for eub@xmath0 concomitant with the magnetic phase transition .",
    "the synchronous band broadening is verified through our model , too .",
    "the experimentally measured dependence of effective mass , occupation number and plasma frequency are qualitatively confirmed .    in our model the change in the carrier concentration dominates over the change of the effective mass , whereas in the model proposed by hirsch @xcite only the change of the effective mass is made responsible for the specific properties of eub@xmath71 .    with the chosen parameters , motivated by experiments ,",
    "eub@xmath0 turns out to be not only metallic but halfmetallic in the ferromagnetic regime",
    ". that would need further experimental investigations since the halfmetallic behavior is announced as a possible result of future gw - calculations in [ and not explicitly excluded in the shubnikov - de haas and de haas - van alphen measurements .",
    "a possible refinement of our calculation will be to consider a real band structure for eub@xmath0 .",
    "above t@xmath1 up to 30k is a regime of phase separation where bound magnetic polarons and percolation effects play a significant role .",
    "that is not included in our model yet , since the magnetization is not calculated self consistently .",
    "that should be done in future corresponding to [ .",
    "further on it would be interesting to study the diluted system ca@xmath72eu@xmath73b@xmath0 as was done in [ .",
