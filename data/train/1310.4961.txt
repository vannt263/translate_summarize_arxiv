    "we are witnessing the increased interest in the study of quantum phase transitions @xcite in magnetic systems @xcite , which can be triggered by varying some of the system s parameters .",
    "these include exchange integrals , external magnetic field , or the doping concentration in the case of high- tc superconductors .",
    "the motivation for studying the quantum phase transitions comes in part from closely related problem of strongly correlated systems at low temperatures .",
    "they display transition between ground state ( @xmath4 k ) phases as a combination of the quantum fluctuations and the competition between interactions , i.e. frustration @xcite .",
    "nowdays , a frustrated spin systems are among the most interesting and challenging topics in theoretical magnetism , including even frustrated 2d ising model @xcite .",
    "competition between exchange interactions in magnetic materials can lead to a variety of the magnetic ordering states , and even to induce a phase transitions between them .",
    "consequently , the frustrated quantum heisenberg magnets with competing nearest - neighbour ( nn ) and next - nearest - neighbour ( nnn ) antriferromagnetic ( af ) exchange interactions ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively ) have become extremely active field of research .    the early works focused on the square lattice heisenberg model , and it was investigated in detail by different methods @xcite . with vanishing nnn interaction ( @xmath7 ) , the ground is state known to be antiferromagnetic ( af ) for @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "a nonzero nnn interaction leads to the frustration and the  crash  of simple af ordering . for large enough @xmath6 ,",
    "the `` stripe phase '' emerges @xcite , with possible spin - liquid phase at @xmath9 .",
    "( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we shall be interested in 3d version of the problem , with localized spins arranged on a body - centered - cubic ( bcc ) lattice .",
    "the mean field calculation @xcite indicates existence of two phases , represented with different spin orderings on the figure 1 .",
    "n ' eel state ( af1 ) can be described by a standard two - sublattice system , while the proper treatment of the stripe phase ( af2 ) can be accomplished by the introduction of four sublattices .",
    "the transition between two phases is governed by the frustration ratio @xmath2 and the mean - field calculation gives @xmath10 for its critical value @xcite .",
    "numerous sophisticated methods were subsequently used to obtain more reliable value of the critical frustration ratio .",
    "schmidt et al .",
    "@xcite carried out exact diagonalization of finite 3d lattices with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "ground state energy was found to have a discontinuity at @xmath11 indicating a first order quantum transition between two phases .",
    "this was confirmed by calculation of magnetization and extrapolation to infinite lattice .",
    "j. oitmaa and w. zhang @xcite performed high - order linked - cluster expansion at @xmath12 and obtained that two branches of ground state energy for af1 and af2 phases cross at @xmath13 .",
    "majumdar and datta @xcite presented a non - linear spin wave theory ( up to quartic terms in bose - operators ) giving quite similar results .",
    "majumdar @xcite also extended this problem to the antiferromanget on stacked square lattices with different exchange in vertical direction .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present , up to the our knowledge , the first application of spin operator green s functions on spin-@xmath0 bcc lattice @xmath1 heisenberg antiferromagnet .",
    "it will be shown that spin operator temperature green function ( tgf ) method , in combination with random phase approximation ( rpa ) , yields reliable results both at @xmath4k and at critical temperature .",
