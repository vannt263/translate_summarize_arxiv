    "most of the mass in our universe is believed to be an unknown , collisionless form of matter that can only interact gravitationally with baryonic matter and itself @xcite .",
    "the formation of large - scale structures in our universe , in particular galaxy clustering , is driven by gravitational forces exerted by this dark matter .",
    "cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmology holds that structures grow hierarchically , with small objects collapsing first and then merging to form more massive galaxies and clusters .",
    "the theory predicts that only dark matter halos with mass smaller than approximately @xmath0  m@xmath1 can form from 3@xmath2 fluctuations @xcite in primordial density perturbations .",
    "consequently , more massive systems can only form by subsequent accretion of these protogalactic fragments .",
    "for this reason , dwarf galaxies ( dark matter subhalos in cdm cosmology ) that contain luminous baryons and have not yet merged with a host galaxy , can , to some extent , be considered some of the most primitive building blocks of our universe .",
    "however , it is now thought @xcite that the inconsistencies between the observed properties of large galaxies and dwarfs are too many to believe that the former are built up only by means of successive accretions of the latter .",
    "we investigate two key issues identified with this model .",
    "the first issue has long been known , namely that the spatial distribution of the milky way satellites shows asymmetric patterns and probably streams @xcite , particularly when only the innermost satellites are taken into account ( figure [ fig : haproj ] ) .",
    "the orbits of these satellites have been found to be preferentially polar @xcite based on wealth of evidence including the alignment of satellites on the sky @xcite , the orientation of the magellanic stream @xcite , the three - dimensional distribution of satellites @xcite and their actual velocities @xcite .",
    "@xcite similarly find that nearby clusters such as virgo and coma possess galaxy distributions that tend to be aligned with the principal axis of the cluster itself .",
    "they conclude that either some dynamical process is responsible or that the orbital parameters of the dwarf galaxies are imprinted on them at the time they enter the host halo .",
    "they concluded that this hypothesis can be excluded at a 99.5% level , given the empirical constraints showing the milky way potential to be spherical @xcite .",
    "multiple arguments have been put forward to explain the disk - of - satellites problem , primarily based on cdm simulation models .",
    "@xcite argue that the observed distribution of the milky way satellites is indeed consistent with being cdm subhalos , assuming that the satellites follow the distribution of the dark matter within the milky way halo . @xcite",
    "used a semi - analytic model to identify luminous satellites and showed that an isotropic distribution is not the correct null - hypothesis ; rather , the host halos are mildly triaxial ( tending to be more prolate than oblate ) .",
    "following similar lines to @xcite , they found that the distribution of the galactic satellite system is in fact consistent with being cdm substructure , albeit with a low probability .",
    "however , this disk - of - satellites is much less extended than nearby dwarf galaxy associations , and such an association falling into the galaxy is unlikely to have produced the disk - of - satellites @xcite .",
    "the second more specific problem is that , if simple accretion were the only mechanism for galactic growth , then the spheroidal dwarf galaxy leo  i has an improbably high radial velocity .",
    "@xcite finds the systemic velocity of leo  i to be @xmath3  km  s@xmath4 for any subsample of the set of 33 red giants in the leo  i dwarf spheroidal galaxy for which they obtained radial velocities from spectra taken using the hires echelle spectrograph on the keck telescope .",
    "this suggests that milky way satellites as a whole need to be considered in the wider context of the whole local group . due to this exceptional velocity",
    ", leo  i has an anomalously large effect compared to other satellites on estimates of the mass of the milky way . @xcite",
    "use bayes theorem and the assumption of isotropic orbits for the satellites of our galaxy to estimate a median probable mass of @xmath5@xmath6  m@xmath1 .",
    "interestingly , however , the exclusion of leo  i would lower this estimate to @xmath5@xmath7  m@xmath1 . their result implies that leo  i may not be gravitationally bound to the milky way ( in order to agree with other estimates of the milky way mass derived by @xcite and others , see table  [ tab : lmcsmcorb ] ) .    in this paper we postulate an additional mechanism to explain the asymmetric dwarf galaxy distribution and the unusually high radial velocity of leo  i. we conjecture that some of the dwarf galaxies may have ` piggybacked ' in with the lmc - smc binary pair , but had their bound orbits disrupted by interactions with the central galactic potential .",
    "dwarfs bound to the lmc initially will be closer than most dwarf galaxy associations , and the subsequent interactions may have resulted in a 3-body interaction that ejected leo  i and thus could reproduce its current high velocity while still explaining the narrow spacing of the disk - of - satellites association . to test this hypothesis we first explore the past orbits of the lmc - smc under the effect of a central galactic potential pair in accordance with the latest measurements of their proper motions . numerically solving newton s equations backwards in time , we proceed to find their position in phase space at apogalacticon .",
    "we then model the infall of this configuration as an _",
    "n_-body system containing the lmc and smc as well as multiple dwarf galaxies ( hereafter , all references to dwarfs and dwarf - dwarf interactions exclude the lmc and smc ) in bound orbits around the lmc .",

    "those that are unbound indicates that the distributions of initial energy are different for model c today and at @xmath144  myr ( the null - hypothesis that the distributions are the same has probabilities of @xmath184 and @xmath185 ) and for model d today and at @xmath144  myr ( @xmath184 , @xmath185 ) .",
    "the fraction of dwarfs that remain bound as a function of initial energy is shown in figure [ fig : boundperc ] .",
    "dwarfs that were bound one apogalacticon ago ( model c ) are still undergoing removal from the magellanic system as it passes close to the galactic center .",
    "dwarfs that were bound two apogalacticons ago ( model d ) are no longer undergoing removal , with dwarfs that are bound now remaining bound over the next @xmath186  myr , with a handful being recaptured as they pass close by the lmc during their own orbit of the galaxy .",
    "no matter when the dwarfs were originally bound , dwarfs that were deep inside the potential well originally are much more likely to be bound today and remain bound over the next @xmath186  myr , while dwarfs of energy above about @xmath187  erg are all equally likely to be removed .",
    "@xmath187  erg the dwarf is increasingly likely to become unbound .",
    "dwarfs that were bound two apogalacticons ago ( model d ) are just as likely to be stripped in @xmath144  myr as now , indicating that any stripping of the dwarfs from the magellanic system will have already taken place .",
    "dwarfs that were bound one apogalacticon ago ( model c ) are still undergoing stripping from the magellanic system , with dwarfs more likely to be unbound at @xmath144  myr then the present day.[fig : boundperc],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the large tail of dwarfs with highly eccentric orbits seen in model d is also reflected in the energy - angular momentum diagram ( figure [ fig : eang ] ) , with these dwarfs occupying high angular momentum , high energy positions on this diagram .",
    "relatively few unbound dwarfs occupy the same position on this diagram as dwarfs that end up bound , and any detected dwarfs that occupy this position will be less likely to have fallen in with the lmc on a previous orbit .",
    "the appearance of a disk - of - satellites around the milky way , has been associated with the infall of a group of dwarf galaxies @xcite and in particular the infall of the magellanic system @xcite .",
    "this scenario  an association of dwarfs falling onto the milky way  has been found to require a much more compact distribution than is seen in dwarf associations in the local group @xcite .",
    "these bound associations were also unstable when orbiting a larger galaxy .",
    "few dwarfs who would spend their entire undisturbed orbit within the tidal radius remain bound after two pericentre passages , and almost half are lost within @xmath186  myr of the first pericentre passage . here",
    "we examine the properties of dwarfs that were bound to the lmc in the past , and whether this scenario could be responsible for some of the dwarf galaxies seen today . as no dwarfs seen today",
    "are bound to the lmc , possibly excluding the smc , any dwarfs associated in the past with the magellanic system were likely to have been high in the potential well .",
    "if there were multiple small dwarfs bound to the lmc , they were unlikely to have interacted , with no difference seen between models which had only one dwarf associated and those with four .",
    "the presence of smaller dwarfs , which possessed insufficient gas to form dwarf galaxies will be more numerous and may have an effect on the orbit of these dwarfs .",
    "this lack of interaction may arise from the lmc stabilizing the orbits of dwarfs against minor perturbations .",
    "interactions with larger galaxies , such as dwarfs interacting with lmc sized galaxies , or the lmc / smc interactions can produce noticeable differences in the orbits and morphology of dwarf galaxies @xcite .    of the dwarfs listed by @xcite as possibly part of the magellanic system when falling in , only sagittarius , ursa minor , sculptor , carina and draco",
    "are located within the area that our model dwarfs end up .",
    "sextans and fornax , located slightly outside the range of dwarfs , may also have fallen in with the magellanic system having become unbound before the previous two apogalacticons .",
    "using the velocities from @xcite we examine the direction of travel of the dwarfs in the y  z plane .",
    "ursa minor and sagittarius are travelling clockwise in the y  z plane consistent with them falling in with the magellanic system , while the remaining dwarfs have errors large enough to be consistent with both travelling clockwise and counter - clockwise .",
    "of the remaining dwarfs , carina is unlikely to have interacted with the lmc in the last @xmath188  gyr @xcite and correspondingly did not fall in with the magellanic system .",
    "future observations , with precise proper motions ( e.g. from gaia ) may exclude more dwarfs using this simple rotation test , or via their positions on an energy - angular momentum diagram , with the dwarfs from our models ending up in only a few regions of the diagram , some of which are exclusively bound to the lmc ( of the dwarfs seen today , only the smc may be bound ) .",
    "the assumption of a spherically smooth and static potential for the milky way halo is known to be unrealistic . a triaxial",
    "potential can have noticeable impacts on dwarf orbits over time @xcite , but this potential makes modelling the history of observed dwarfs backwards much harder . on the other hand it may allow more of the dwarfs observed today the possibility of being associated with the magellanic system at an earlier time .",
    "models in which the magellanic system is on its first orbit of the galaxy show a much reduced loss .",
    "this is partially due to the perturbation of the lmc and smc s orbits by dwarfs over long times .",
    "the possiblity of dwarf companions therefore needs to be taken into account when determing the orbit of the lmc and smc .",
    "the lmc , and to a lesser extent the smc , were assumed to be tidally stripped before entering the galactic halo .",
    "tidal stripping that happens as the lmc enters the halo will increase dynamical friction and subsequently result in a lower velocity today than those present in model f. as most dwarfs are lost when the smc binds to the lmc ( an event that is likely to have happened after the lmc enters the galactic halo ; see * ? ? ? * ) or at perigalaction ( approximately today ) , dwarfs in this scenario may be better represented by model c.    the restriction that dwarfs initially spend their entire orbit within the tidal radius of the lmc ( with respect to the galaxy ) clearly leaves out bound orbits ( those with negative energy with respect to the lmc ) .",
    "dwarfs on these extra - tidal orbits are extremely likely to be tidally stripped and and could also be the source of some dwarf galaxies that reside in the disk - of - satellites .",
    "we have modelled the orbits of a group of dwarf galaxies bound to the lmc at a previous apogalacticon using a monte carlo approach , varying the orbits within observational errors .",
    "dwarf galaxies bound to the lmc are unlikely to interact with each other , and a significant fraction become unbound from the magellanic system after only half an orbit .",
    "these dwarfs would be located around the magellanic system today and likely be noticeably associated with it .",
    "dwarfs that were bound one and a half orbits ago  that is at the lmc s second - last apogalacticon  are over six times more likely to become unbound than remain bound , with many dwarfs being located either in an extended structure of orbits , or in a tight disk around the galaxy .",
    "this disk encompasses the locations of a number of dwarfs observed today around the milky way , so a number of these dwarfs may originally have fallen in with the magellanic system and been captured by the galaxy .",
    "the common rotation direction of the dwarfs in this ring provides a test to rule out any counter - rotating dwarfs as originally associated with the magellanic system . the extended disk - of - satellites",
    "can not be explained by the dwarfs being bound to the lmc within the last two apogalacticons , and may have another origin .",
    "in addition , the anomalous velocity and position of leo  i is not explained by this mechanism , with no dwarfs in any of the simulations approaching the position , let alone the velocity , of leo  i."
