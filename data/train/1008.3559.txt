    "theoretical issues concerning the understanding of physical processes where neutrinos are produced , scattered , or absorbed have been investigated through the years . in parallel , strong arguments about the neutrino contribution to the energy density of the universe have been constructed on very - well understood physical basis .",
    "the role of neutrinos in the quintessence cosmology indeed comprises a major and still open issue that also involves the complete understanding of dark matter and dark energy , and the mechanism responsible for the onset of the accelerating phase of the universe @xcite . in particular , models of mass varying neutrinos ( mavan s ) @xcite coupled to a dark energy light scalar field component have been considered for explaining the emergence of an accelerating phase in recent cosmological times .",
    "the simplest realization of the mavan mechanism consists in writing down an effective potential which , in addition to a scalar field dependent term , contains a term related to the neutrino energy density . in",
    "the mavan scenarios the neutrinos remain essentially massless until recent times .",
    "when their mass eventually grows close to its present value , they form a non - relativistic ( nr ) fluid and the interaction with the scalar field stops its evolution .",
    "the potential energy of the dark energy component becomes the universe s dominant contribution and the cosmological acceleration ensues .",
    "however , mavan models face stability problems for the most of choices of neutrino - scalar field couplings and scalar field potentials . actually , when neutrinos become nr .",
    "this instability is characterized by a negative squared speed of sound for an effective neutrino - dark energy coupled fluid , and results in the exponential growth of small scale modes @xcite . a natural interpretation for this",
    "is that the universe becomes inhomogeneous with the neutrinos forming denser structures or lumps .",
    "effectively , the scalar field could mediate an attractive force between neutrinos leading to the formation of neutrino nuggets .    for the scenario of structure formation",
    ", we obtain static , spherically symmetric solutions of the einstein equations that describe hypothetical neutrino lumps . as a first approach , we study the schwarzschild s so called interior solution for a sphere of incompressible fluid of constant density @xmath1 and pressure @xmath2 which drops from its central value to zero at the surface .",
    "we determine the corresponding mass defect in order to obtain the stability conditions for neutrino lumps .",
    "we also verify how the mass varying mechanism , as a mechanism to form compact structures , can modify the cosmological predictions for neutrino masses . due to the adiabatic conditions that we have set up ,",
    "the thermodynamic pressure @xmath2 and its explicit dependence on @xmath3 are simply given in terms of @xmath4 , and can be explicitly computed from the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equations for the hydrostatic equilibrium @xcite .",
    "it justifies the assumption of an explicit analytical dependence of the variable mass on the radial coordinate of the massive body , @xmath5 .",
    "actually , at our approach the neutrino mass behaves like an additional extensive thermodynamic degree of freedom .",
    "the stability analysis reveals that our static solutions become dynamically unstable for modified buchdahl limits @xcite set by the ratio between total mass - energy and lump radius , @xmath0 .",
    "we also find regular solutions that to an outside observer resemble schwarzschild black holes in formation .",
    "it remains an open question whether such stable solutions do exist .    in section",
    "ii , after briefly explaining the mass varying mechanism in the standard friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmological scenario , we establish the connection among the energy density @xmath1 , the particle variable mass @xmath6 and the particle density @xmath7 , for an adiabatic system of mass varying particles .",
    "it results in a completely closed relation through which one can quantify the role of the mass varying mechanism in the study of structure formation @xcite .",
    "we also summarize the procedure for obtaining the mass defect as a function of the lump radius and for performing the analysis of stability of equilibrium configurations .",

    "we draw our conclusions in section iv by summarizing our findings and discussing their implications .",
    "the influence of the spectrum of dynamical masses on thermodynamic of interactions are reported in the following .",
    "in particular , we shall investigate the effects on stellar structures of neutral matter like , for instance , dark matter and _ sterile_/active neutrinos @xcite .",
    "that is the reason for which we shall accomplish the idea of mutual interaction among neutral particles driven by the coupling to a scalar field through previously quoted mass varying mechanisms @xcite .      in the usual mass varying scenario , mass varying particles",
    "are coupled to a light scalar field which is identified with the dark sector .",
    "presumably , the particle mass @xmath8 has its origin on the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the scalar field so that its behaviour is governed by the dependence of the scalar field on the scale factor . given a particle statistical distribution @xmath9 , in the flat frw cosmological scenario , the corresponding energy density and pressure can be expressed by @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the background temperature at present , and we have assumed present - day values with @xmath13 .",

    "the extremely weak interaction between dark matter and/or neutrinos and a slowly varying scalar field are sometimes described in terms of the _ cosmon _ dynamics @xcite .",
    "_ cosmon _ lumps are bound objects , for which the scalar and gravitational fields combine to form non - linear solutions of their field equations .",

    "certainly the form of @xmath42 and the equation of state constraint may lead to quite different scenarios .",

    "we have shown how the mass varying mechanism could modify the equilibrium condition based on the mass defect criterium for relativistic stellar objects .",

    "the equilibrium conditions are achieved just for smaller values of @xmath0 , constraining the existence of neutrino lumps to compact objects with arbitrarily small masses .",
    "in fact , the coupling with the background scalar field is relevant in determining the bounds for stability . at the same time , the possibility of neutrino lumps to follow their collapse essentially due to the scalar mediated attractive interaction has to be more carefully elaborated .",
    "we have assumed that the radius and mass of the compact objects which belong to the family of allowed tov solutions depend on details of the dynamical formation mechanism . as we have quoted before , the subtleties of the study of the neutrino mass generation mechanism and the analytical dependence of the scalar field on the spacetime curvature are not mandatory .",
    "since the higgs sector @xcite and the neutrino sector are possibly the only ones where one can couple a new standard model ( sm ) singlet without upsetting the known phenomenology , the replacement of the explicit dependence of the neutrino mass on the scalar field @xmath22 by a direct link to the radial coordinate of the curved space is acceptable .    to end up",
    ", we emphasize that allowing for a dynamical behaviour to a scalar field associated to dark energy in connection with the sm neutrinos and the electroweak interactions may bring important insights on the physics beyond the sm .",

    "<S> we report about stability conditions for static , spherically symmetric objects that share the essential features of mass varying neutrinos in cosmological scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> compact structures of particles with variable mass are held together preponderantly by an attractive force mediated by a background scalar field . </S>",
    "<S> their corresponding conditions for equilibrium and stability are given in terms of the ratio between the total mass - energy and the spherical lump radius , @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the mass varying mechanism leading to lump formation can modify the cosmological predictions for the cosmological neutrino mass limits . </S>",
    "<S> our study comprises tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff solutions of relativistic objects with non - uniform energy densities . </S>",
    "<S> the results leave open some questions concerning stable regular solutions that , to an external observer , very closely reproduce the preliminary conditions to form schwarzschild black holes . </S>"
