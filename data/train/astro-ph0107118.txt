    "recent high resolution imaging by @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) has revealed super star clusters ( hereafter referred to as sscs ) with masses of @xmath4 @xmath5 , very young ages and large dust extinction in ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( uligs ) , most of which are ongoing mergers ( e.g. , shaya et al .",
    "1994 surace et al . 1998 ; surace & sanders 1999 ; scoville et al .",
    "these sscs are frequently observed not only in merging galaxies with and without ultra - luminous infrared activity ( e.g , in the `` antenna '' by whitmore et al .",
    "1999 ) but also in starburst galaxies such as m82 ( e.g. , de grijs et al . 2001 ) , which implies that the presence of sscs is a generic feature in intensively starbursting or merging galaxies such as uligs ( lutz 1991 ; ashman & zepf 1992 ; surace & sanders 1999 ) .",
    "these discoveries of sscs in uligs have raised the following three questions ( e.g. , shaya et al .",
    "1994 ; forbes , brodie , & grillmair 1997 ; mclaughlin 1999 ; larsen & richtler 2000 ) : ( 1 ) what is the dominant mechanism of ssc formation ?",
    "( 2 ) how can the global dynamics of merging galaxies be associated with the ssc formation ? ( 3 ) is the formation efficiency of sscs different between merging galaxies and normal spirals ?",
    "the purpose of this letter is to investigate the formation and dynamical evolution of sscs in uligs formed by gas - rich major mergers and thereby to try and provide some plausible answers for the above three questions . in particular , we adopt the plausible assumption that the rather high pressure of the warm interstellar gas ( @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 : @xmath9 is boltzmann s constant ) can induce global collapse of giant molecular clouds to form massive compact star clusters corresponding to sscs ( jog & solomon 1992 ; harris & pudritz 1994 ; elmegreen & efremov 1997 ) .",
    "accordingly we investigate numerically the time evolution of gaseous pressure in gas - rich mergers with different merger parameters .",
    "previous theoretical results have already demonstrated that if a compact stellar system has a very large number of stellar - mass black holes left after the normal processes of stellar evolution ( in massive stars ) , these black holes can evolve into a single massive black hole ( e.g. , quinlan & shapiro 1989 ; lee 1995 ) .",
    "based on simple analytic arguments , we suggest that sscs formed in an ulig can be transformed into a compact self - gravitating stellar system ( i.e. , a considerably large ssc ) either with a few tens massive black holes ( mbhs ) with masses ranging from @xmath10 to @xmath11 @xmath5 or with @xmath11@xmath12 stellar - mass black holes .",
    "thus the present numerical results combined with analytical ones suggest that the dynamical evolution of sscs in the central regions of uligs can be closely associated with the formation of super - massive black holes .",
    "our numerical methods for modeling chemodynamical evolution of dusty starbursts associated with galaxy mergers have already been described by bekki & shioya ( 1998 ) furthermore the details of the adopted treesph , which is based on that used in early numerical works ( e.g. , heller & shlosman 1994 ) , are given by bekki ( 1995 ) .",
    "we accordingly give these numerical techniques only a brief review here .",
    "we construct models of galaxy mergers between gas - rich disks by using the model of fall - efstathiou ( 1980 ) .",
    "the total mass and the size of a progenitor exponential disk are @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively . from now on ,",
    "all the masses and lengths are measured in units of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively , unless otherwise specified .",
    "velocity and time are measured in units of @xmath15 = @xmath16 and @xmath17 = @xmath18 , respectively , where @xmath19 is the gravitational constant and assumed to be 1.0 in the present study . if we adopt @xmath13 = 6.0 @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 and @xmath14 = 17.5 kpc as fiducial values , then @xmath15 = 1.21 @xmath20 @xmath23 km @xmath24 and @xmath17 = 1.41 @xmath20 @xmath25 yr , respectively .",
    "the dark - to - disk halo mass ratio and the star - to - gas mass ratio are set equal to 4.0 and 9.0 , respectively .",
    "bulge component is not included in the present study .",
    "an isothermal equation of state is used for the gas with a temperature of @xmath26 k ( corresponding to a sound speed of 10 km @xmath24 ) .",
    "the initial metallicity , @xmath27 , for each gaseous particle in a given galactic radius @xmath28 ( kpc ) from the center of a disk is given according to the observed relation @xmath29 of typical late - type disk galaxies ( e.g. , zaritsky , kennicutt , & huchra 1994 ) .",
    "we present the results mostly for merger models with nearly prograde - prograde orbital configurations , parabolic encounters , and a pericentric distance of 0.5 @xmath14 .",
    "we change the mass ratio ( @xmath30 ) of the two merging disks and thereby investigate the dependence of ssc formation processes on @xmath30 over the range 0.1 ( corresponding to minor merging ) @xmath31",
    "@xmath32 @xmath31 1.0 ( major ) . for comparison",
    ", we also show the results of an isolated disk model and a tidally interacting one ( in which two galaxies do not merge with each other owing to the large pericentric radius of 2 @xmath14 adopted for the parabolic orbit ) .",
    "total particle number in each simulation is 23178 for the collisionless components and 20000 for the collisional ones .",
    "we adopt the following two different star formation laws and thereby convert the gaseous components into collisionless new stellar particles . in the first law , we adopt the formation model for sscs ( globular clusters ) of harris & pudritz ( 1994 ) in which interstellar gaseous pressure ( @xmath33 ) in star forming regions of a galaxy can drive pressure confined , magnetized self - gravitating proto - cluster molecular clouds to collapse to form sscs if @xmath33 is larger than the surface pressure ( @xmath34 ) of the clouds : @xmath35 in the simulations , a gas particle becomes @xmath36 new ssc if the particle s pressure is larger than @xmath34 = @xmath37 .",
    "although we can not investigate the detailed physical processes of ssc formation in the present @xmath38 ( from @xmath39 100 pc to 10 kpc scale ) simulation , the adopted phenomenological approach of ssc formation enables us to trace at least the most promising formation sites of sscs in an admittedly plausible way .",
    "the other is the schmidt law ( schmidt 1959 ) with the exponent of 1.5 ( kennicutt 1989 ) and newly formed stars due to the schmidt law are referred to as `` normal stars '' ( represented by ns from now on ) for convenience .",
    "if both conditions are satisfied above , only ssc is assumed to be formed .",
    "the effects of radiative cooling and those of supernovae feedback effects on ssc formation will be explored in our future papers .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath34 = @xmath40 , the formation efficiency is @xmath39 6 times smaller .",
    "figure 1 clearly demonstrates how the gaseous pressure of the interstellar medium becomes dramatically higher ( @xmath10-@xmath8 @xmath9 ) in some regions of the major merger model with @xmath30 = 1.0 at @xmath41 = 0.28 gyr ( starburst phase with the star formation rate of @xmath39 75 @xmath5 @xmath42 ) in comparison with the initial disks .",
    "furthermore , gaseous pressure for some fraction of the gas particles ( in particular , in the central regions ) exceeds the threshold value of @xmath37 for ssc formation , essentially because rapid transfer of gas to the central region of the merger and efficient gaseous shock dissipation increase the gaseous density and pressure greatly .",
    "these results clearly explain the reason why sscs can be formed in uligs and imply that the formation efficiency of sscs are much higher in merging galaxies with massive starbursts than in `` normal '' disk galaxies .",
    "figure 2 shows that sscs are formed not only in the central region , where gas fueling is more efficient , but also in the outer tidal tails and `` bridges '' among the two cores , where the tidal force of the merger forms thin and high - density gaseous layers owing to gaseous shock dissipation .",
    "this result is qualitatively consistent with recent @xmath3 observational results that sscs are located both in the central regions ( e.g. , arp 220 by shaya et al .",
    "1994 ) and in between the two merging cores ( e.g. , vv114 by scoville et al .",
    "2000 ) of ultra - luminous infrared galaxy mergers .    as is shown in figure 3 , the peak metallicity in the metallicity distribution of sscs is fairly high ( 0.05 corresponding to 2.5 solar value and a factor of 2 higher than metal - rich globular clusters in ellipticals ) , firstly because the initial mean metallicity of the merger precursor disk is assumed to be also high ( 1.4 solar ) , and secondly because chemical enrichment due to starbursts makes the metallicity of sscs considerably higher .",
    "we stress here that the derived metallicity distribution depends strongly on the initial metallicity distributions of the gaseous disks : the peak metallicity of sscs is smaller for a merger with low initial gaseous metallicity .",
    "figure 3 also demonstrates that the age distribution is rather narrow ( compared with the distribution in metallicity ) , which reflects the fact that ssc formation is efficient only when two disks interact with each other so violently that gaseous pressure becomes drastically high ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "figure 4 provides the following three predictions on the formation of sscs .",
    "firstly , the formation efficiency of sscs ( i.e. , the ratio of ssc mass to initial gas mass ) is more likely to be higher in a merger with larger @xmath30 .",
    "total ssc number ( i.e. , formation frequency ) is larger for larger @xmath30 and the ssc formation is more widely spread spatially for larger @xmath30 . assuming the same orbital and spin geometry and orientation , tidal disturbance that takes places in the galaxy merger is stronger and the maximum star formation rate is higher for a merger with larger @xmath30 ( bekki & shioya 2000 ) .",
    "therefore these results imply that a merger with a more strongly perturbed morphology and a more massive starburst population can show a higher efficiency of ssc formation .",
    "secondly , the ratio of the total ssc mass to that of the new stellar components ( both sscs and ns ) is more likely to be larger for a merger with larger @xmath30 .",
    "this implies that the luminosity fraction of sscs , which is observationally estimated to be less than 20 % for uligs ( e.g. , shioya et al .",
    "2001 for the case of arp 220 ) , can be higher for a merger with larger @xmath30 .",
    "thirdly , the higher ssc formation efficiency and the larger relative ssc mass ratio in major mergers than in tidally interacting galaxies imply that major mergers , which more dramatically transform galactic morphologies than tidally interacting ones ( e.g. m82 ) , provide the most promising formation sites of sscs .",
    "one of the most longstanding and remarkable problems in the formation and evolution of uligs is whether there is an evolutionary link between the two different types of nuclear activities , starburst and agn , ( e.g. , sanders & mirabel 1996 ) .",
    "previous theoretical studies have attempted to understand either physical mechanisms for the efficient radial transfer of gas to the nuclear starburst regions in major mergers ( e.g. , barnes & hernquist 1992 ; mihos & hernquist 1996 ) or the growth process of the already existing seed massive black holes ( with masses of @xmath39 @xmath11 @xmath5 ; norman & scoville 1988 ) .",
    "we discuss here this problem in the context of _ how a cluster of sscs in the circumnuclear region of an ulig evolves dynamically into a seed mbh_. we suggest that the following time scale of dynamical friction ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) is important for discussing this problem of ssc evolution : @xmath44 here we neglect the ln(@xmath45 ) term ( @xmath39 6.6 for a plausible set of parameters ) , and @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 are the initial radius ( from the center of an ulig ) , circular velocity , and mass of the ssc , respectively .",
    "this time scale argument implies that sscs formed by dusty starbursts in major mergers can sink into the central @xmath49 pc region and consequently merge with one another to form a single massive nuclear ssc within a few dynamical time scales of the ulig ( i.e. , @xmath39 @xmath50 yr ) .",
    "we here point out that the fate of sscs depends strongly on whether or not these are tidally disrupted in merging galaxies : it is also possible that sscs are disrupted by the central strong tidal field of uligs before they reach the central few pc in uligs .",
    "however , recent observational ( e.g. , okuda et al .",
    "1990 ; nagata et al .",
    "1995 ) and theoretical ( e.g. , zwart et al . 2000 ) results demonstrated that the central region of the galaxy can easily harbor compact star clusters ( corresponding to sscs ) .",
    "although dynamical conditions could be different between the central region of the galaxy and those of mergers , these results on the galactic sscs imply that sscs in uligs can also survive from tidal disruption owing to their compact nature and consequently reach the central few pc via dynamical friction .",
    "a high - density compact stellar system has been demonstrated to form a single mbh as a result of the coalescence of stellar - mass black holes or neutron stars left after the normal processes of stellar evolution , within the dynamical relaxation time scale of @xmath51 ( e.g. lee 1995 ) .",
    "therefore , if the central region of an ulig has @xmath39 @xmath52 sscs with typical mass @xmath11 @xmath5 and if @xmath53 @xmath7 @xmath51 , a single very massive nuclear cluster with @xmath39 @xmath52 seed mbhs ( each of mass @xmath54 @xmath5 ) can be formed after the merging of the sscs . furthermore , these mbhs in the cluster may well sink into the central sub - pc region as a result of dynamical friction and consequently form a self - gravitating mbh cluster .",
    "although it could be possible that multiple merging of these mbhs through gravitational radiation loss in this mbh cluster can form a single mbh , the evolution of such multiple mbh interaction is obviously beyond the scope of this paper ( see more detailed discussions in valtonen et al .",
    "1994 and xu & ostriker 1994 ) . on the other hand , if @xmath53 @xmath55 @xmath51 , then a single massive cluster with huge number of ( @xmath39 @xmath12 ) stellar - mass black holes can be formed . in this case also , successive merging of these black holes in a cluster can drive the formation of a single super massive black hole within the hubble time if both the density and the velocity dispersion of the cluster are rather high ( quinlan & shapiro 1989 ) .",
    "although these discussions are highly speculative , in each case , it seems to be inevitable that a central supermassive black hole forms as a natural result of dynamical evolution of sscs in the nuclear region of an ulig .",
    "recent dynamical studies based on @xmath3 photometry and ground - based spectroscopy of the central bulge regions of 36 nearby galaxies demonstrated that the nuclear mbh ( or massive dark object ) to bulge mass ratio ( @xmath56 ) is @xmath39 0.006 ( magorrian et al 1998 ) . if we adopt the assumption that most giant elliptical galaxies and bulges are formed by gas - rich major mergers ( e.g. , toomre 1977 ) and successors of uligs ( e.g. , sanders et al . 1988 ) , we can discuss whether the mbh formation due to merging of sscs in uligs is consistent with the observed @xmath56 value . for a spheroidal galaxy formed by merging , @xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 are the gas mass fraction , the mass ratio of new stars formed during merging ( including sscs ) to gas mass , that of sscs to the total mass of new stars , and that of the total mass of stellar - mass black holes to the total mass of a ssc .",
    "if we adopt a set of plausible values , @xmath58 = 0.2 ( from the typical value observed for late - type spirals ) , @xmath59 = 0.8 ( from the present study ) , @xmath60 = 0.2 ( shioya et al . 2001 ) , and @xmath61 = 0.1 ( norman & scoville 1988 ) , then @xmath56 = 0.0032 , which is similar to the value observed .",
    "the most important point in the above estimation is that the origin of @xmath56 can be closely associated with _",
    "the formation efficiency of sscs in uligs _ ( @xmath60 ) , which has not been pointed out by previous studies . finally , we suggest that the origin of the physical relationship between the masses of mbhs and those of galactic spheroids ( e.g. , magorrian et al . 1998 ) can be understood in terms of the formation and evolution of sscs ."
