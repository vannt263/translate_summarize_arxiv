    "x - ray free - electron lasers ( fels )  @xcite provide unparalleled peak brightness and open a new era in science and technology , offering many possibilities that have not been conceivable with conventional light sources  @xcite .",
    "the world s first x - ray fel  the linac coherent light source ( lcls ) at slac national accelerator laboratory  @xcite  has been in operation since 2009 , with a photon energy of up to 8.3  kev , up to @xmath4  photons per pulse , and a full - width - half - maximum ( fwhm ) pulse length as short as a few femtoseconds .",
    "the spring-8 compact sase source ( scss ) at spring-8  @xcite and the european x - ray fel at desy  @xcite are under construction and are planned to deliver up to 12  kev photon energy with an average brightness 5500 times higher than lcls .",
    "one of the prospective applications of x - ray fels is single - shot imaging of individual macromolecules  @xcite , which employs coherent x - ray scattering to determine the atomically resolved structure of non - crystallized biomolecules or other nanoparticles  @xcite .",
    "single - shot imaging becomes possible because the high fluence of a tightly focused x - ray fel pulse could produce a significant amount of scattered photons from single - molecule samples .",
    "one of the key challenges in single - shot imaging using ultraintense x rays is radiation damage  @xcite .",
    "each target molecule undergoes electronic damage via processes such as photoionization and auger decay .",
    "the positively charged atomic ions formed in this way repel each other , thus leading to coulomb explosion of the target molecule  @xcite .",
    "since the fluence required for single - shot imaging exceeds the conventional damage limit ( 200 photons / @xmath1 )  @xcite , these damage effects could degrade the scattering patterns and hinder the determination of the atomic positions in the target molecule . to suppress the impact of the molecular coulomb explosion on atomically resolved imaging",
    ", one must effectively freeze the atomic motion during the x - ray pulse , requiring a pulse duration of no more than ten femtoseconds  @xcite .",
    "following this idea , several theoretical approaches were used to simulate the radiation damage processes including the movement of the atoms : references  @xcite employed molecular dynamics , refs .",
    "@xcite based their description on a hydrodynamic model , and refs .",
    "@xcite used a kinetic boltzmann model . for _ electronic _ damage processes , which in the x - ray regime are mainly atom - specific",
    ", one may concentrate , to a first approximation , on the interaction of the x rays with individual atoms .",
    "the dynamics of bound electrons in an isolated atom during an ultraintense x - ray pulse were investigated theoretically in connection with hollow - atom formation  @xcite , x - ray fluorescence  @xcite , and radiation damage  @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that even if the atomic motion during an x - ray pulse is negligible , electronic damage dynamics during the x - ray pulse may directly influence x - ray scattering patterns by altering the electronic density in the target  @xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , crucial to understand detailed ionization and relaxation dynamics in individual atoms under ultrashort and ultraintense x - ray pulses .    a series of recent experiments conducted at lcls revealed how electrons interact with ultraintense , ultrafast x - ray pulses  @xcite . in the x - ray regime ,",
    "photoabsorption predominantly affects inner - shell ( core ) electrons .",
    "if inner - shell photoabsorption is saturated , all inner - shell electrons in a given atom may be removed before auger decay or other relaxation processes occur  @xcite .",
    "the transient state thus produced is referred to as a hollow atom .",
    "if the pulse length is short enough , the hollow atom retains its core vacancies during the pulse . because the x - ray photoabsorption probability is smaller for valence electrons than for inner - shell electrons , hollow - atom formation suppresses further electronic damage .",
    "this effect is called x - ray transparency  @xcite or frustrated absorption  @xcite , and might be beneficial for single - shot imaging of individual molecules  @xcite .",
    "the present paper investigates this idea in detail and provides criteria for the x - ray fel parameters required .    to treat x - ray  atom interactions ,",
    "we employ a consistent _ ab initio _",
    "framework  @xcite based on nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics and perturbation theory .",
    "this x - ray atomic theory has been applied to study x - ray absorption by laser - dressed atoms  @xcite and x - ray scattering from laser - aligned molecules  @xcite . in this paper , we present a practical implementation of this _ ab initio _ framework as a toolkit to calculate cross sections and rates of x - ray - induced processes for various charge states and electronic configurations of an isolated atom within an approximation to the hartree  fock model . with those parameters ,",
    "we simulate hollow - atom formation dynamics under ultrashort and ultraintense x - ray pulses by means of time - dependent rate equations  @xcite .",
    "then we investigate the effects of hollow - atom formation on coherent x - ray scattering from atomic carbon .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] , we present theoretical methods to compute cross sections and rates of all electronic damage processes , which are integrated into a set of rate equations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we explore coherent x - ray scattering signals influenced by hollow - atom formation and their dependence on x - ray fel parameters such as pulse length , fluence , and photon energy , and on the spatial resolution of the image .",
    "we also discuss the role of electron impact ionization in molecules .",
    "we conclude with a summary and future perspectives in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the present toolkit of x - ray atomic processes covers ionization , relaxation ( auger decay and fluorescence ) , and coherent x - ray scattering .",
    "we assume that inelastically ( compton ) scattered photons are energetically distinguishable from elastically ( coherently ) scattered photons and focus on coherent scattering processes for imaging problems .",
    "compton scattering contributes to electronic damage , but is negligible in comparison with photoionization for the photon energies under consideration  @xcite .",
    "shake - up and shake - off processes  @xcite also make a small contribution to electronic damage and are not included in our model .",
    "we also neglect impact ionization  @xcite , i.e. , secondary ionization in molecules induced by photoelectrons and/or auger electrons via ( e,2e ) processes .",
    "we will discuss a straightforward strategy to reduce impact ionization in sec .",
    "[ sec : impact_ionization ] .",
    "atomic units are used in this section .      in order to implement the _ ab initio _",
    "framework  @xcite , we use the hartree  fock ",
    "slater ( hfs ) model  @xcite , which employs a local density approximation to the exact exchange interaction .",
    "the effective one - electron ( mean - field ) schrdinger equation to be solved is @xmath5 \\psi(\\mathbf{r } ) = \\varepsilon \\psi(\\mathbf{r}).\\ ] ] here the potential is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the nuclear charge and the electronic density @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the spin ",
    "orbital index and @xmath11 is the number of electrons .",
    "the exchange term is approximated by the slater exchange potential  @xcite , @xmath12^{1/3}.\\ ] ] in addition , the potential includes the latter tail correction  @xcite to obtain the proper long - range potential for both occupied and unoccupied orbitals , i.e. , we put @xmath13 if the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : potential ] ) is less negative than @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the effective charge of the system .",
    "after angular momentum averaging , the problem becomes spherically symmetric , and each solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : se ] ) can be expressed in terms of the product of a radial wave function and a spherical harmonic .",
    "for example , a bound - state spatial orbital with quantum numbers @xmath16 may be written as @xmath17 for the bound states , the radial wave function @xmath18 is accurately solved by the generalized pseudospectral method  @xcite on a nonuniform grid . for the continuum states , @xmath19 is numerically solved by the fourth - order runge  kutta method for a given energy @xmath20 on a uniform grid  @xcite . to evaluate integrals involving both bound and continuum states , we use spline interpolation to map the bound - state orbitals from the nonuniform grid to the denser uniform grid employed for the continuum states .",
    "for the bound - state calculations , the theoretical procedure presented here is identical to the herman ",
    "skillman code  @xcite , which has been widely used in atomic physics , but the numerical part of the present toolkit utilizes a different grid method with the following advantages .",
    "firstly , it is easy to control convergence with respect to the grid parameters .",
    "secondly , we can avoid truncation of the maximum radius internally imposed by the herman ",
    "skillman code , which causes numerical instability for photoabsorption cross section calculations .",
    "lastly , the matrix eigenvalue problem is solved by a modern linear algebra package  @xcite . for the present calculations , we use 200 grid points and a maximum radius of 50  a.u .  for the bound states ( nonuniform grids ) and a radial step size of 0.001  a.u .  for the continuum states ( uniform grids ) to achieve machine accuracy for cross sections and rates .",
    "we calculate all cross sections and rates for all possible electronic configurations . for example , a neutral carbon atom has a 1s@xmath212s@xmath212p@xmath21 ground configuration , so the number of all configurations that can be formed by removing 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , or all 6 electrons from the occupied orbitals is @xmath22 .",
    "note that we perform a separate hfs calculation for each configuration .",
    "in other words , the orbitals are optimized in the presence of core and/or valence vacancies .",
    "thus , orbital relaxation for the core - hole configurations is automatically included , a strategy that is known to be in good agreement with multiconfigurational self - consistent - field calculations  @xcite .",
    "the cross section for ionizing an electron in the @xmath10th subshell by absorbing an x - ray photon with energy @xmath23 is given by  @xcite    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the fine - structure constant , @xmath26 is the occupation number of the @xmath10th subshell , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the photoelectron energy . here , @xmath29 is the ionization energy of the @xmath10th subshell ( @xmath30 ) by koopmans theorem  @xcite , which is approximately valid in the hfs model .",
    "the orbital energy @xmath31 and the radial wave functions @xmath32 and @xmath33 are calculated for a given electronic configuration .",
    "we do not consider orbital hole alignment after ionization by linearly - polarized x - ray pulses and , hence , assume that the density of bound electrons remains spherically symmetric throughout .",
    "table  [ table : pcs ] shows x - ray absorption cross sections for all configurations of carbon ( except the bare nucleus ) at photon energies of 8  kev and 12  kev , respectively .",
    "the photon energy range considered here is consistent with that available at current and future x - ray fels  @xcite .",
    "note that the present total cross sections are in agreement with those in the literature  @xcite to within less than 10% .",
    "the impact of orbital relaxation is evident in the subshell cross sections shown in table  [ table : pcs ] .",
    "for instance , the 2s subshell cross section for the 1s@xmath342s@xmath212p@xmath21 and 1s@xmath352s@xmath212p@xmath21 configurations differ by 40% and 90% , respectively , from the 2s subshell cross section for the ground configuration of neutral carbon .    as may be seen in table  [ table : pcs ] ,",
    "the cross sections for the 1s and 2s subshells are much greater than the 2p subshell cross section , because @xmath36 is proportional to @xmath37 in the high energy limit  @xcite .",
    "therefore , absorption of linearly polarized x rays does not , in general , induce any orbital hole alignment .",
    "this justifies our assumption of spherically symmetric electron densities .",
