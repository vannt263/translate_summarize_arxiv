    "@xmath1 vortex with @xmath2 phase winding is a hallmark of macroscopic quantum state such as superfluidity and superconductivity @xcite . in superconductors ,",
    "a vortex is accompanied by a quantum of magnetic flux @xmath0 in a closed path with zero supercurrent .",
    "since the quantization of magnetic flux is intimately related to the phase winding , superconductivity gap functions carrying intrinsic phase variation induced by unconventional pairing symmetry should leave unique consequences on the response to external magnetic field .",
    "several interesting examples are available .",
    "a tricrystal ring of cuprate superconductor @xmath3 was observed to carry a half flux quanta @xmath4 , which is the signature for @xmath5-wave pairing symmetry @xcite . in a ring - shaped setup composed of nb and @xmath6 ,",
    "flux jumps in odd - number multiple of half flux quanta were observed @xcite , which provide support to the @xmath7 pairing symmetry for iron - pnictide superconductors @xcite .",
    "half - valued fluxoid jumps in magnetization curve of a thin annular coil composed of @xmath8 were reported to be consistent with the @xmath9-wave pairing symmetry @xcite .",
    "the degree of freedom of relative phase difference in a two - component superconductor was first discussed by leggett @xcite , and experimental observations on the collective leggett mode were reported for mgb@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "phase solitons in one of the two superconducting gap functions associated with fractional fluxoid jumps have been investigated @xcite .    another interesting possibility in multi - component superconductors",
    "was raised some time ago @xcite whereby josephson - like inter - component repulsions among three condensates can generate frustrations in phases of gap functions and induce a time - reversal - symmetry - broken ( trsb ) superconducting state even without external magnetic field , which corresponds to a high dimensional irreducible representation of point group similarly to the @xmath9-wave superconductor  @xcite . due to the discovery of iron - pnictide superconductors",
    "where several orbitals of fe contribute to multi superconducting condensates , this possibility becomes realistic and a considerable amount of subsequent works have been devoted to discuss its thermodynamic stability and various novel properties @xcite .",
    "recently it has been revealed by the present authors that , in a josephson junction between a conventional single - component superconductor and a multicomponent superconductor in the trsb state , the critical current should be asymmetric with respect to the current direction as the consequence of broken trs @xcite . as a matter of fact ,",
    "unequal critical currents in opposite current directions were observed experimentally in a josephson junction between @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the trsb state may have been realized already in iron - based superconductors , which is consistent with a microscopic analysis where band structures and strongly correlated effects are taken into account @xcite .",
    "cross checking this novel superconducting phenomenon becomes an important issue .    in the present work ,",
    "we address a new phase - sensitive property of the trsb superconducting state . as schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , we consider a loop of a multicomponent superconductor where the two halves are occupied by two trsb states carrying opposite chiralities , accompanied by two domain walls associated with inter - component phase kinks .",
    "we reveal explicitly that fractional flux plateaus appear in magnetization curve associated with free - energy minima , where the domain walls accommodate phase kinks among different components leading to @xmath2 phase winding along the loop only in one or two of the three condensates .",
    "while the heights of fractional flux plateaus depend on material parameters and temperature , they form pairs with heights related by the flux quantum @xmath13 , which is a unique signature of the trsb superconducting state and can be used to confirm the state itself . in a more general point of view",
    "this provides a novel chance to explore relative phase difference , phase kink and soliton in ubiquitous multicomponent superconductivity .",
    "the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows . the mechanism for fractional flux plateaus in presence of domain walls",
    "is discussed in sec .",
    "we then simulate the magnetizing process with the time - dependent ginzburg - landau ( tdgl ) approach and confirm fractional flux plateaus associated with free - energy minima in sec .",
    "iii . in sec .",
    "iv , we study an asymmetric loop where the widths of two domain walls differ . in sec .",
    "v we discuss the stability of the domain - wall structure and temperature dependence of the fractional flux plateaus . finally we give a summary in sec . vi .",
    "in order to reveal the essence of physics we first consider an isotropic trsb state which is generated by three equivalent condensates with equal mutual repulsion . for simplicity",
    "all order parameters are taken as @xmath14-wave from now on .",
    "the two states in the loop are given by @xmath15 and @xmath16 with opposite chiralities ( see fig .  [ f1 ] ) .",
    "across each of the two domain walls between the left and right halves of the superconductor loop , there is a phase kink where the intercomponent phase difference between two of the three order parameters shrinks to zero and reopens in the opposite way continuously , resulting in a sign reversal in the phase difference at the two sides of domain ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "we notice that phase kinks are gauge - invariant objects , which inevitably appear at the interface between two bulks of trsb states with opposite chiralities .    when the two domain walls accommodate the phase kink between the same two condensates , such as that between condensate 1 and 2 defined as d@xmath17 in fig .",
    "[ f2](a ) , the phase rotation integrated in a counterclockwise manner ( indicated by @xmath18 in fig .",

    ", the flux trapped in the loop is an integer multiple of flux quantum @xmath13 when the loop is thick enough to fully screen the magnetic field .",
    "the situation differs when the two domain walls accommodate different phase kinks , such as d@xmath17 and d@xmath19 in domain wall i and ii respectively shown in fig .",
    "[ f2](b ) . by inspection",
    "one sees that @xmath20 rotates @xmath21 anticlockwise over the two domain walls , while @xmath22 and @xmath23 rotate @xmath24 .",
    "when the external magnetic field provides the additional phase rotation of @xmath25 in all condensates , a state with @xmath2 phase winding in @xmath20 and @xmath26 in both @xmath22 and @xmath23 is stabilized .",
    "this yields a fractional flux quanta @xmath27 in the loop .",
    "the state with a fractional flux trapped in this loop is expected to be stable in a certain range of external magnetic field , which leads to a fractional flux plateau in magnetization curve shown schematically in fig .",

    "the integrand in the second contribution is nonzero only on domain walls .",
    "this contribution is nonzero when two different phase kinks are realized at domain wall i and ii , with the value depending also on the quantities @xmath36 .",
    "presuming the same length of domain walls i and ii , the two configurations [ d@xmath37/d@xmath38 and [ d@xmath39/d@xmath37 ] at the domain walls [ i / ii ] take the same free energy .",
    "however , integrating phase differences for these two configurations along the closed path in the counterclockwise manner ( see fig .",

    "it is worth noticing that even in this asymmetric loop the plateau at @xmath88 is still stable for @xmath89 , since it is associated with the same phase - kink configuration with that at @xmath85 and a difference of flux quantum @xmath13 coming from the first term in eq .",
    "( [ flux expression ] ) . in this asymmetric loop",
    ", the magnetization curve is asymmetric with respect to the direction of the magnetic field as in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] . the property that fractional flux plateaus in positive and negative magnetic fields",
    "are paired with the difference of flux quantum @xmath13 is robust , and can be taken as a crosscheck for fractional flux plateaus originated from the trsb state .",
    "in the present work we study the case that the left and right halves of the superconductor loop take the two trsb states with opposite chiralities . this situation can be realized in experiments by cooling the whole system from temperature above @xmath90 with laser heat pulse irradiated on regions i and ii @xcite .",
    "the two halves condensate independently and by chance arrive at the different trsb superconducting states , leading to the two domain walls at region i and ii after releasing the irradiation . in order to check the stability of this configuration",
    ", we estimate the free energy of the whole system in terms of the tdgl approach . as shown in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] , the state with two domain walls located at the middle of the top and bottom sides of the loop corresponds to a free - energy minimum .",
    "the domain walls once generated should be stable since moving them outside the loop is prohibited by a large free - energy barrier which is produced by an elongated , single domain wall during the process of domain - wall relocation ( see that at @xmath91 in the inset of fig .  [ f7 ] ) .",
    "the stability of the present setup against relocating one of the two domain walls along the loop can be provided by widening the left and right arms of the loop . the increase in free energy in states with fractional fluxes and integer",
    "flux quanta upon application of external magnetic field is smaller by one order of magnitude than the free - energy barrier as seen in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] , which justifies the discussion on fractional flux plateaus in the present work .    at this point",
    "we notice that the free - energy barrier in fig .  7 generated by the two trsb states at the two halves of superconductor loop is crucially important for the thermodynamic stability of fractional flux plateaus . from eq .",
    "( [ flux expression ] ) one might think that a two - component superconductor or a three - component one with preserved trs can also accommodate fractional fluxes .",
    "however , in these cases there is no free - energy barrier like that in fig .  7 , and states with fractional fluxes are unstable .",
    "the amplitudes and inter - component phase differences of order parameters change with temperature , leading to variation in stable domain - wall structures . as a result ,",
    "both height and width of a fractional flux plateau should change as temperature is swept . during field - cooling or field - heating processes , jumps between states with fractional fluxes and/or integer multiples of flux quantum can take place .",
    "half - valued fluxoid jumps in magnetization curve were reported in a small multicomponent superconducting sample comparable with penetration length@xcite .",
    "this results in incomplete screening of magnetic field , and thus the magnetization curve exhibits a finite slope for any external magnetic field .",
    "namely , there is no fractional flux plateau in their system . in previous studies on vortex states of trsb superconductor",
    "it was discussed that vortex cores of different condensates can deviate from each other in space @xcite . however , without a closed path along which supercurrent is zero everywhere , there is no fractional flux plateau in the magnetization curve .",
    "to summarize , we have studied the magnetic response of a loop of three - component superconductor with two degenerate time - reversal symmetry broken states at two halves . when the two domain walls between the two halves accommodate different intercomponent phase kinks , fractional flux plateaus appear in the magnetization curve which form pairs related to each other by the flux quantum .",
    "these properties are expected to be helpful for detecting experimentally the time - reversal symmetry broken superconducting state which can be realized in iron - pnictide superconductors . in general",
    ", this endeavour provides a novel chance to explore relative phase difference , phase kink and soliton in ubiquitous multi - component superconductivity .",
    "the authors are grateful to masashi tachiki , zhi wang , yusuke kato and atsutaka maeda for stimulating discussions .",

    "an example of the distribution of supercurrent density in the superconductor loop and order parameters on domain walls is shown in fig .",
    "[ f8 ] , where the superconductivity survives in all components and the meissner effect screens the magnetic field and thus the total supercurrent to zero .",
    "the important feature here is that , although the supercurrents in individual components are not zero due to the phase shifts , they flow in opposite directions and cancel each other , leading to zero total supercurrent .",
    "the situation of a domain wall as discussed in the present work differs considerably from a vortex , where the phase winding induces a divergent kinetic energy , which necessitates total suppression of the amplitude of the superconducting order parameter at the vortex core .",

    "<S> time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) may be broken in superconductors with three or more condensates interacting repulsively , yielding two degenerate states specified by chirality of gap functions . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a loop of such superconductor with two halves occupied by the two states with opposite chiralities . </S>",
    "<S> fractional flux plateaus are found in magnetization curve associated with free - energy minima , where the two domain walls between the two halves of loop accommodate different inter - component phase kinks leading to finite winding numbers around the loop only in a part of all condensates . </S>",
    "<S> fractional flux plateaus form pairs related by the flux quantum @xmath0 , although they individually take arbitrary values depending on material parameters and temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon is a clear evidence of trs broken superconductivity , and in a general point of view it provides a novel chance to explore relative phase difference , phase kink and soliton in ubiquitous multi - component superconductivity such as that in iron pnicitides . </S>"
