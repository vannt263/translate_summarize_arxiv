    "[ t1 ] for every @xmath2 there exists a finite set of graphs @xmath3 such that every minimally @xmath0-matchable graph is isomorphic to the disjoint union of an odd subdivision of some graph from @xmath3 and any number of copies of @xmath4 .",
    "it is easy to see that the minimally @xmath11-matchable graphs are just disjoint unions of any number ( perhaps @xmath12 ) of copies of @xmath4 , and that the minimally @xmath13-matchable graphs are disjoint unions of a single cycle @xmath14 of even length @xmath15 and any number of copies of @xmath4 .",
    "so theorem [ t1 ] holds with @xmath16 , and for @xmath17 .",
    "however , the situation gets more complex for larger @xmath0 , not only in terms of an increasing size of the sets @xmath3 ; for example , the classes of minimally @xmath0-matchable graphs need not even to be disjoint for distinct @xmath0 : the disjoint union @xmath1 of two even cycles has four perfect matchings , but deleting any edge results in a graph which has only two perfect matchings ; therefore , @xmath1 is minimally @xmath18-matchable and , at the same time , minimally @xmath19-matchable .",
    "there are some results on graphs with a fixed number of perfect matchings .",
    "for example it is known that for every positive integer @xmath0 there exists a constant @xmath20 such that the maximum number of edges of a simple graph with @xmath21 vertices , @xmath21 even and large enough , and with exactly @xmath0 perfect matchings is equal to @xmath22 @xcite , where @xmath23 and @xmath20 is positive for @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "another `` extremal '' result of a similar flavour states that for every simple graph @xmath1 on @xmath21 vertices and @xmath25 edges there exists a graph @xmath26 on @xmath21 vertices and @xmath25 edges with @xmath27 such that @xmath26 is a _ threshold graph _ , that is , it admits a clique @xmath28 such that the vertices from @xmath29 are independent and their neighborhoods form a chain with respect to @xmath30 . this has been used to determine the minimum number of perfect matchings in a simple graph on @xmath21 vertices and @xmath25 edges @xcite ;",
    "although being a minimizing result at first glance , that number is trivially @xmath12 if @xmath31 , so that the interesting part of the analysis is concerned with extremely dense graphs . among the few structural results on graphs with a fixed or even only a small number of perfect matchings let us mention lovsz s cathedral theorem ( see chapter 5 in @xcite ) , which characterizes the _ maximal _ graphs having exactly @xmath0 perfect matchings , and kotzig s classic theorem that every connected graph with a unique perfect matching admits a bridge from that matching @xcite .",
    "the latter theorem has been used recently to prove that a graph @xmath1 without three pairwise nonadjacent vertices and exactly one optimal coloring ( in terms of the chromatic number ) has a shallow clique minor of order at least @xmath32 @xcite , which supports seymour s conjecture that every graph @xmath1 without three pairwise nonadjacent vertices in general admits a shallow clique minor of order at least @xmath32 . by getting more structural insight into graphs ( and",
    "also hypergraphs ) with only a few perfect matchings  as provided by our main result  it may be possible to generalize the results from @xcite .",
