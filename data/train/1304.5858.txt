    "the dynamic response function and the dynamic structure factor of nuclear matter at @xmath4-equilibrium are key ingredients to understand the mechanisms related to interaction processes occurring in the interior of neutron stars .",
    "as it is well known since the seminal works of sawyer@xcite , the structure factor is related to the mean free path of neutrinos in the nuclear medium@xcite .",
    "the opacity of nuclear matter to neutrinos , and its implication in the neutrino emission in the early phases of existence of a neutron star have been widely reviewed in the paper of burrows et al .",
    ".    another interesting piece of information that can be extracted from the knowledge of the dynamic structure factor concerns the mechanical instability that can be related to divergencies in the response function , and in a nonphysical negative value of the compressibility .",
    "this is particularly interesting at values of the density where homogeneous matter is supposed to give way to more exotic inhomogeneous phases , before reaching the regime in which neutron rich nuclei are dominant@xcite .",
    "an interesting attempt to compute the structure factor of neutron matter by means of semiclassical simulations in this regime was recently performed by horowitz et al.@xcite .    in general ,",
    "several calculations of the low momentum structure factor of neutron matter have been performed using different methods , for instance in the framework of bhf - rpa theories , both at zero and finite temperature@xcite , or in the landau theory approach starting from cbf effective interactions@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose a different route to the computation of the dynamic structure factor in the isoscalar and isovector channels for an infinite nuclear matter with an arbitrary asymmetry .",
    "the approach is based on first deriving a reasonable isospin - density functional from an equation of state ( eos ) computed by means of the auxiliary field diffusion monte carlo ( afdmc)@xcite method by gandolfi et al.@xcite . in that paper",
    "the eos is derived from a density - dependent interaction effectively in the including many - body contributions to the interaction .",
    "this hamiltonian was fitted to correctly reproduce the saturation properties of symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "however , the predictions of the eos of pure neutron matter and matter at @xmath4-equilibrium , including both electrons and muons , produce realistic values of quantities such as the mass / radius relation in the same range of accuracy of i.e. the apr eos@xcite .",
    "obviously the range of densities that can be safely investigated relying on this eos are limited . in the low density limit nuclear matter",
    "becomes unstable , and neutron matter should be described including pairing correlations@xcite . at densities of order 2@xmath5 , where @xmath5=0.16@xmath6 is the nuclear matter saturation density",
    ", one can expect the onset of hypernuclear degrees of freedom@xcite , which completely changes the scenario .",
    "the isospin - density functional is then used in a generalized linear response framework based on the time dependent local density approximation ( tdlda ) .",
    "following the idea of the local spin density approximation ( lsda , see e.g.@xcite ) , and its extension to the study of the dynamics of the system@xcite , we derive the response function in a time dependent local isospin approximation ( tdlida ) , and compute all the relevant physical quantities such as the frequency and strength of the collective modes and the compressibility for various values of the density and of the asymmetry at t=0 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we will introduce in detail the derivation of the energy density functional ; in section ii the extension of the tdlda to the case of excitation in the isovector channel is discussed ; section iv contains the description of the resuts , and section iv is devoted to conclusions .",
    "by following the kohn - sham method@xcite , we introduce the local isospin density approximation ( lida ) for nuclear matter defining the energy functional as : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the kinetic energy of the non interacting system with density @xmath9 , and isospin polarization @xmath10 with @xmath11 , and where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the neutron and proton densities , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath14 is the kinetic energy of the non - interacting system , therefore missing the contribtions coming from dynamical quantum correlations .",
    "however , it has a comparable magnitude and is consistently treated in this method .",
    "equation ( [ eq 1a ] ) defines the interaction - correlation energy per particle @xmath15 of the asymmetric nuclear matter with density @xmath0 and isospin polarization @xmath2 .",
    "this quantity can be extracted by any independent calculation of the total energy per particle of asymmetric nuclear matter after subtraction of the free kinetic energy contributions at each value of the @xmath0 and @xmath2 .    in this work",
    "we will use for @xmath15 the following parametrization based on the auxiliary field diffusion monte carlo ( afdmc ) calculations of ref . :",
    "@xmath16~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 are the interaction correlation energies of symmetric nuclear ( @xmath18 ) , and neutron matter ( @xmath19 ) , respectively .",
    "we have assumed the saturation density value @xmath20@xmath6 .",
    "the values of the parameters in eq .",
    "( [ eq 33 ] ) we have extracted from the fit are given in table i.    .coefficients of the parameterization of the interaction - correlation energy of symmetric nuclear matter ( @xmath21=0 ) and pure neutron matter ( @xmath21=1 ) derived by fitting the equation of state of ref .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in figs.4 - 8 we then plot the quasi - particle - quasi - hole excitation strengths @xmath22 in units of @xmath23 for different values of the density @xmath0 and @xmath24 at fixed values of the isospin polarization @xmath2 . this quantity has been obtained by numerically computing the immaginary part of expression ( [ eq 21 ] ) . in the figures",
    "the fraction of energy weighted sum rule exhausted by the continuum of quasi - single particle states is explicitly indicated , and the position of the collective state , if present , is indicated by an arrow . in all the calculations presented in the following",
    ", we have numerically checked that the particle - hole and collective contributions to the strength completly exhaust the @xmath25 sum rule .",
    "let us start the discussion of the two extreme cases corresponding to @xmath26 ( symmetric nuclear matter @xmath27 ) and @xmath28 ( pure neutron matter @xmath29 ) .",
    "in the first case ( @xmath27 ) , isoscalar and isovector modes are decoupled in the sense that the isoscalar and isovector density operators @xmath30 and @xmath31 give rise to distinct isoscalar and isovector strengths @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "this is different from what happens when @xmath34 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 can indifferently excite modes both in the isoscalar and in the isovector channels , with strengths and weights depending on the values of @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "obviously , for neutron matter ( @xmath29 ) it makes no sense to speak of isoscalar and isovector modes since in this case there is only one type of excitation .    for symmetric nuclear matter ( @xmath26 ) at density @xmath35@xmath6 , in the isoscalar strength",
    "@xmath36 a strong collective state is present at @xmath37 , exhausting about 83.6% of the energy weighted sum rule @xmath25 .",
    "a continuum of single particle type excitations is instead predicted at lower @xmath24 values .",
    "a similar situation occurs for @xmath38 . here",
    "the collective state is at at @xmath39 , and exhausts about 80.1% of the energy weighted sum rule @xmath25 .",
    "the collective states in both the cases occurr at energies which are closer to the mean excitation energies @xmath40 than to the @xmath41 ones , showing that the collective modes are of mainly of elastic type .",
    "this situation is analogous to what happens , for instance , in liquid he@xmath42 . by decreasing the density ,",
    "we still predict the existence of a strong collective state in the isovector channel , exhausting about 80% of the energy weighted sum rule @xmath25 . on the other hand , the collective mode disppears in the isoscalar channel , due to landau damping .",
    "the situation is similar , but not exactly the same , in the case of pure neutron matter ( @xmath28 ) . at high density ( @xmath43 @xmath6 )",
    "the dynamic form factor shows a strong collective state of elastic nature at @xmath44 , exhausting about 81.4% of the energy weighted sum rule , together with a continuum of single particle excitations at lower @xmath24 values .",
    "decreasing the density to @xmath45 @xmath6 , the energy of the collective state decreases , likewise the percentage of @xmath25 sum rule exhausted by this state .",
    "eventually , at some density below @xmath45 @xmath6 , the collective completely decays in one particle - one hole excitations .",
    "when @xmath34 , isoscalar and isovector probes excite an admixture of isoscalar and isovector modes . in all cases",
    "we predict a single collective state , when present , having different weights in @xmath25 for the isovector and isoscalar channels .",
    "the typical situation expected in the neutron star core is that of a small quantity of protons present in the neutron matter , corresponding to @xmath2 close to 1 .",
    "rather than considering the proton fraction predicted for each value of the density by the afdmc equation of state , we have considered the cases @xmath46 and @xmath47 for all densities , in order to have an idea of the evolution of the collective modes with this parameter . for such values of the asymmetry , a clean collective state in both channels",
    "is present only at high density , where it exhausts about 70 - 80% of the @xmath25 sum rule . already at saturation density @xmath45@xmath6 , this state has almost completly decayed into particle - hole excitations , since it exhausts only about the 30% of the @xmath25 sum rule in both channels . at @xmath48 it is completly damped .",
    "this suggests that collective modes in the isoscalar or isovectors channels can be present going inward from the interface between the inner crust and the outer core .",
    "another interesting analysis can be made by looking at the compressibility ( in unit of the free one ) as a function of the density for different values of the proton fraction .",
    "this quantity is given by @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and is plotted in figs .",
    "9 . it can be noticed that a strong divergence for a density near to @xmath51@xmath6 appears at @xmath47 , and that it moves to a larger density increasing the proton fraction .",
    "we interpret this divergence as a sort of mechanical instability of matter towards the formation of an inhomogeneous phase , as expected in the inner crust of the neutron star .",
    "it is also interesting to look at the regime that would correspond to asymmetries typical of very neutron rich nuclei ( @xmath52 ) . at ( unphysical )",
    "high density , a collective state exhausting about the 50 - 60% of @xmath25 at @xmath53 is present both in @xmath36 and @xmath38 . at the same time the quasi - particle - quasi - hole strength is practically concentrated in one state at a value of @xmath24 sligthly smaller than 1 and exhausting about the 50 - 40% of @xmath25 . by lowering the density , we observe that at @xmath45@xmath6 the collective state appears at a lower energy , and remains collective only in the isovector channel , where it still exhausta more than 60% of theenergy weighted sum rule . in the isoscalar channel most of the strength",
    "is taken by the one - particle - one excitations , though concentrated in a narrow region of @xmath24 , and the `` collective '' solution exhausts only about 17.8% of the @xmath25 sum rule . at @xmath54@xmath6",
    "the collective mode can be excited only by an isovector probe , and in the isoscalar channel it is practically completly damped .",
    "the quasi - particle - quasi - hole strength is distributed in a wide range of @xmath24 in the isoscalar channel , whereas in the isovector one continues to see a substantial concentration at @xmath55 .",
    "t     and @xmath56 as a function of the density @xmath0 for values of @xmath2 close to 1 . ]",
    "this situation might be interpreted in analogy to what happens in nuclei with a large excess of neutrons , where a low energy peak beyond the usual giant resonance is observed in the isovector channel .",
    "b     and @xmath56 as a function of the isospin asymmetry @xmath2 for three different values of the density . ]    finally , in figs .",
    "10 we plot the compressibility ratio for three different values of the density . at @xmath26 and @xmath28",
    ", @xmath49 gives the compressibility of symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter , respectively .",
    "these values are not far from the results computed by other authors starting from a microscopic av8 hamiltonian@xcite . from the figures one also sees that differently from what happens at low density , at normal and high densities , @xmath49 is practically independent on @xmath2 . on the contrary , @xmath57 results to be always an increasing function of the isospin asymmetry .",
    "we have studied the dynamic form factor of asymmetric nuclear matter by using a time - dependent local isospin density approximation approach based on a local density energy functional derived by an auxiliary field diffusion monte carlo calculation .",
    "the more relevant results we have found are the following : i ) the presence of a strong collective state at high density at an energy which increases with the value of the nuclear asymmetry @xmath1 ; decreasing the density down to saturation ( @xmath45 @xmath6 ) , this state tends to decay in quasi - particle - quasi hole states .",
    "the decay is faster in the isoscalar channel , where it remains very collective only at values of @xmath2 close to 0 . further decreasing the density , the collective states survives only in the isovector channel at small values of @xmath2 , which are typical of the neutron star interior .",
    "ii ) when a small fraction of protons is added to the neutron matter and @xmath2 is equal to 0.8 , 0.9 , at values of the density near or slightly smaller of 0.09 @xmath58 the system becomes unstable .",
    "this unstability is seen in the isoscalar and isovector compressibilities , which at such densities diverge .",
    "iii ) when @xmath2 is around 0.3 ( small asymmetry ) , in the isovector channel at all the densities two states cohexist , one of collective and the other of quasi - particle - quasi - hole nature , practically sharing the fraction of exhausted energy - weighted sum rule .",
    "this is similar to what is observed in the photodisintegration of large neutron excess nuclei .",
