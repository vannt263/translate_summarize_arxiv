    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is the theory of the physics that dominates at very small scales , the femtoscale ( @xmath1  m ) , where fundamental particles ( quarks and gluons ) are bound inside the building blocks of matter , protons and neutrons .",
    "this is far smaller than the size of the atoms ( @xmath2  m ) which form molecules ( nanoscale , @xmath3 ) in the materials we are familiar with , like a cup of coffee .",
    "what do we learn by considering physics at this tiny scale ?",
    "for one , we can understand how fundamental particles make up the proton and neutron , and more exotic particles such as hyperons .",
    "further , we may try to see how they interact with each other .",
    "at the nuclear level , we can learn how the residual strong force binds nucleons together into the nuclei that form the cores of all atoms , that power the stars and perhaps one day fusion power plants .",
    "an understanding of how nuclear structure arises from fundamental physics may hold the key to the question of fine tuning ( a mystery relevant to any carbon - based life forms ) .",
    "the interactions between hadrons at small scale also impact objects at the astrophysical scale , such as neutron stars .",
    "the strengths of these interactions can be input into descriptions of nuclear matter in simulations of the conditions in the center of neutron stars , where incredible pressure and density could allow exotic forms of matter to exist .",
    "quantum chromodynamics is the theory of the color force .",
    "it describes the strong interactions between quarks and gluons using an su(3 ) gauge theory .",
    "given a qcd action @xmath4 and interesting observables whose properties are described by an operator @xmath5 , one can compute the physical quantities of interest using a path integral ( integrating over all possible configurations of gluonic and fermionic fields @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) : @xmath9 \\rangle =       \\frac{1}{z } \\int da\\,d\\psi\\,d\\bar{\\psi}\\ ;                         e^{is[a,\\psi,\\bar{\\psi } ] } { \\cal o}[a,\\psi,\\bar{\\psi}].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one of the interesting properties of quantum chromodynamics is confinement . that is ,",
    "we never see free quarks in nature ; rather , all we see are composite particles containing quarks , called hadrons , such as the lightest hadron , the pion , and the proton and neutron of ordinary nuclei . at large energy ,",
    "the qcd coupling is small .",
    "we can simply make an expansion in terms of the coupling , and it converges well .",
    "in fact , the calculations can be easy enough ( at low order ) to give to your graduate field - theory class as homework .",
    "however , at low energy the strong coupling becomes larger and larger , and , by say the scale of neutron beta decay , perturbation theory becomes poorly convergent . at low energy , the theory becomes nonperturbative and even just the vacuum of qcd is incredibly complicated .",
    "the qcd vacuum teems with topological charge and the results of the broken quark chiral symmetry .",
    "figure  [ fig : instantons ] shows a few timeslices of the spatial distribution of topological charge in an example qcd vacuum configuration . unlike the classical vacuum , just to describe this is incredibly complicated and a task that is nearly impossible analytically .",
    "therefore , nonperturbative approaches are essential to exploring qcd physics at this energy scale . in order to study the interesting physics in the low - energy regions , in the 1970s kenneth wilson proposed to discretize space and time in the path integral and to work in euclidean space .",
    "thus , lattice qcd ( lqcd ) was born .",
    "it contains two scales that are absent in continuum qcd , one ultraviolet ( the lattice spacing @xmath10 ) and one infrared ( the spatial extent of the box @xmath11 ) . the problem now only involves a finite number of degrees of freedom and can be put on a computer for numerical integration .     a selection of timeslices showing the topological charge of the vacuum calculated on one gauge - field configuration on a lattice with spacing approximately @xmath12 meters with 16 lattice sites in each spatial direction .",
    "the evolution of the vacuum shown in this image occurs over @xmath13 seconds .",
    "the red regions correspond to instantons with positive topological winding number , while the blue correspond to instantons with negative winding number .",
    ", scaledwidth=75.0% ]    of course , if computational resources were not an issue , we could solve all the qcd problems by brute force as long as we could write down the path integrals .",
    "however , it is not possible within a human lifetime to do so , so we have to examine the problem and solve it more cleverly .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom for a fermion here is the spatial volume times the number ( 3 ) of colors , times the number ( 4 ) of spins .",
    "the number of spatial points varies , for example , a lattice volume with @xmath14 has rank 300 m , and it can not be fit onto a few workstations .",
    "a computational cluster with thousands of cores is necessary .",
    "lattice practitioners use systems ranging from small - size clusters hosted at universities to national supercomputer centers , such as kraken at nics , or cpu - gpu hybrid systems , such as edge at llnl .    in most cases , we spend the majority of computational hours inverting the dirac operator . due to the breaking of continuous rotation symmetry",
    ", multiple versions of the dirac operator can be written on the lattice that describe the same physics in the continuum .",
    "such a discrete dirac operator is a sparse and structured matrix , properties that we can take advantage of to develop smarter solvers for our problem . to illustrate structure of our operator , we show a 2-dimensional version with u(1 ) gauge fields ( in reality",

    "[ eq : wilsond ] .",
    "we can see that it is highly structured along diagonals , with non - zero terms in regular places , but mostly zero .",
    "the eigenvalues of this operator in the complex plane are shown on the right - hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig:2d - wilson ] .",
    "when interactions are turned off , the eigenvalues are these blue circles , while the olive points are the eigenvalues with thermalized u(1 ) gauge fields included . as the quark mass",
    "is decreased , entire eigenspectrum is shifted to the left ; thus , the lowest eigenvalues approach zero and the matrix condition number diverges .",
    "this means that our inversion algorithms will run very slowly .",
    "only recently have ensembles with physical pion masses become available ; most of the time , we do the calculation with multiple heavier masses , and a procedure for extrapolation is necessary .",
    "taking advantage of the structure of the operator , many techniques have been developed to solve the dirac equation faster : eigenvector deflation , multi - mass solvers , multigrid acceleration , stochastic sources .",

    "to `` see '' inside a hadron , we need a stronger `` microscope '' than the typical optical ones ; to probe inside the proton requires , for example , a gev - scale electron beam elastically scattering with a nucleon .",
