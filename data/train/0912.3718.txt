    "indeed , disorder appears as an essential feature in a number of condensed matter systems , motivating a great deal of theoretical and experimental research ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "in particular , it is well known that , in the case of a spin - s random exchange heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain ( rehac ) , disorder can drive the system to the so - called random singlet phase ( rsp ) , which is a gapless phase described by spin singlets distributed over arbitrary distances  @xcite . in recent years , it has been observed that the entanglement entropy in critical random spin chains displays a logarithmic scaling that closely resembles the behavior of pure ( non - disordered ) systems .",

    "these random configurations are generated by following a gapless probability distribution , which drives the system to the rsp , with the entropy of each configuration computed by counting the spin singlets via a renormalization group approach described in the next section .",

    "considering a set of random heisenberg antiferromagnetic interactions @xmath46 between neighbouring spins @xmath47 and @xmath48 , the original mdh method consists in finding the strongest interaction @xmath49 between a pair of spins ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 in fig .",

    "unfortunately , when generalized to higher spins , this method , at least in its simplest version , revealed to be ineffective .",
    "the reason is that , after the elimination procedure of the strongest bond @xmath49 , the effective interaction @xmath55 may be greater than @xmath49 .",
    "then , the problem becomes essentially non - perturbative for arbitrary distributions of exchange interactions .",
    "for instance , considering the rehac with arbitrary spin-@xmath31 , the renormalized coupling is given by the recursive relation  @xcite @xmath56 notice that , for @xmath57 , the renormalization factor is @xmath58 , resulting in the breakdown of perturbation theory . in order to solve this problem ,",
    "a generalization of the mdh method was proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite ( for other proposals , see also  @xcite ) .",

    "this trio of spins is then substituted by one effective spin interacting with its neighbors through new renormalized interactions obtained by degenerate perturbation theory for the ground state of the trio .",
    "this method has been used to successfully investigate the quantum phase diagram of the spin-1  @xcite and spin-3/2  @xcite heisenberg spin chains and will be here applied to the computation of the nonadditive entropy .",
    "let us apply now the generalized mdh approach to analyze the behavior of @xmath24 in the rsp of antiferromagnetic spin chains .",
    "we start with a rehac , whose hamiltonian is given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 are random exchange couplings obeying a probability distribution @xmath64 and @xmath65 are spin - s operators , with periodic boundary conditions adopted .",
    "the numerical investigation of @xmath24 is performed as follows .",
    "we begin by considering spin chains with @xmath66 sites , whose couplings @xmath63 are randomly generated by using a gapless power law distribution @xmath67 , for which trio renormalizations are negligible .",
    "results are then obtained by averaging over a sample of @xmath68 configurations for @xmath63  . for each random configuration @xmath69",
    ", we decimate the spins out via the generalized mdh technique and compute the number @xmath70 of singlets that cross a block of length @xmath11 . the number @xmath70 is counted by following ref .",
    "@xcite . in turn , if a singlet is decimated and the spins composing the singlet are in different blocks , this singlet adds one to the total number @xmath70 . on the other hand , in the case of a trio elimination",
    ", nothing is added to @xmath70 , since one effective spin is returned to the chain ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a similar approach ) .",
    "the decimation procedure is iterated until the elimination of all spins in the chain . after all configurations computed , tsallis entropy is then obtained by averaging over all of them , i.e. , @xmath71 with @xmath72 given by eq .",
    "( [ qe - singlets ] ) .",
    "the results for spin-1/2 , spin-1 , and spin-3/2 rehacs are shown in figs .",

    "these values are clearly distinct for different spin magnitudes @xmath31 . in turn",
    ", a remarkable fact is that @xmath26 depends only on @xmath31 for a system in the rsp and not on the specific model considered .",
    "in fact , let us consider the spin-1 random exchange biquadratic antiferromagnetic chain , whose hamiltonian is given by @xmath73 application of the generalized mdh procedure here results only in the formation of singlets , with the renormalized exchange coupling reading  @xcite @xmath74 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the nearest neighbors of the strongest bond @xmath49 .",
    "as in the heisenberg case , we consider spin chains with @xmath66 sites , whose couplings @xmath63 are randomly generated by using a gapless power law distribution @xmath67 and averaged over a sample of @xmath68 configurations for @xmath63 .",
    "this model produces the same result for @xmath26 as the spin-1 rehac in the rsp . in order to illustrate this equivalence and obtain a numerical value for @xmath26 ,",

    "[ f6 ] for the rehacs ( with different spin magnitudes @xmath31 ) as well as for the spin-1 biquadratic chain , the exponent @xmath33 shows a quadratic dependence on @xmath27 , namely , @xmath77 with @xmath78 .",
    "note in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] the collapse of the spin-1 curves for different models , which indicates that @xmath26 is a unique function of the spin of the chain .",

( [ qext ] ) for the pure case , we can also determine an expression for @xmath26 in terms of @xmath30 for disordered systems , which reinforces the universal properties of the entropic index @xmath27 in critical systems .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the scaling of tsallis entropy @xmath24 in spin - s random critical quantum spin chains . by focusing on the rsp",
    ", we have shown that , for specific values @xmath26 of the entropic index , @xmath24 becomes an extensive quantity , which reconciles the quantum scaling with the clausius - like prescription for classical thermodynamics .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the extensivity of the nonadditive entropy does not imply absence of correlations between the parts of the quantum system . in this context",
    ", there is no contradiction with the behavior of block entanglement as measured by the von neumann entropy .",
    "remarkably , @xmath26 is directly associated with the effective central charge @xmath30 that governs bipartite entanglement in random spin chains , which means that @xmath26 is solely determined by the magnitude @xmath31 of the spin in the chain .",

    "an analytical investigation of this relationship as well as the behavior of @xmath26 in other critical phases of random spin chains ( e.g. , griffiths phase ) are challenges under research . moreover , the scaling of @xmath24 far from the extensivity point is also relevant in connection with the scaling of @xmath86 ( see , e.g. , refs .",
