    "in this paper we suggest a method of computing volume for a polytope @xmath0 in three - dimensional hyperbolic space @xmath1 .",
    "we require the polytope @xmath0 to be simple , so that the computation of volumes may combine two processes of initially different nature .",
    "first , a reduction of @xmath0 ( as a trivalent graph ) to the tetrahedron by a sequence of @xmath4 ( or whitehead ) and so - called `` capping '' moves . and second , a decomposition of @xmath0 into a number of generalised tetrahedra @xmath6 , @xmath7 , such that @xmath6 partition @xmath0 into geometric parts , and @xmath8 .    with such a decomposition",
    "we associate a function @xmath9 , @xmath10 , that depends on some additional geometric parameters of the decomposition ( in fact .",
    "lengths of some common perpendiculars to the faces of @xmath0 ) . under some conditions , we show that @xmath11 can be expressed through the value of @xmath12 at a critical point @xmath13 .    finally , we use our method in a large number of examples , by implementing it in wolfram mathematica^^ @xcite .",
    "we also check our computations , where possible , with the orb software @xcite .",
    "this part of our work falls in line with the recent study on the volume conjecture for generalised tetrahedra by costantino and murakami @xcite and for general hyperbolic polytopes by costantino , guritaud and van der veen @xcite .",
    "next , given a polytope @xmath0 , we consider its @xmath3-skeleton @xmath2 as a trivalent graph , compute the kirillov - reshetikhin invariants of @xmath2 with an appropriate colouring of its edges determined by the corresponding dihedral angles of @xmath0 and study their asymptotic behaviour .",
    "we conjecture that the sequence of combinatorial moves that is used in order to compute the kirillov - reshetikhin invariants of the corresponding trivalent graph @xmath2 is associated with the sequence of moves used in the combinatorial reduction of @xmath0 .",
    "then the geometric decomposition of @xmath0 associated with the respective sequence of @xmath4 and capping moves might be used in order to establish a link between the volume of @xmath0 and the asymptotic behaviour of the kirillov - reshetikhin invariants of @xmath2 .",
    "such a link has been colloquially named the volume conjecture by various authors , and is first established in @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : after recalling some preliminary results on the volume formulas for generalised hyperbolic tetrahedra ( cf .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) , we proceed to the description of our method and formulate the main statement of the paper .",
    "we illustrate our method in two main working examples : computing the volume of a hyperbolic prism @xmath14 , and that of a hyperbolic `` pleated '' prism @xmath15 .",
    "then , we provide a more computationally complicated example of a dodecahedron with various coxeter dihedral angles .",
    "however , the method of present paper is not restricted to coxeter polytopes .",
    "we expect it to work in a wide variety of dihedral angles , and expect that it can be generalised to allow computing volumes of knotted trivalent graphs .",
    "finally , we state a number of conjectures relating the volume of a hyperbolic polyhedron @xmath0 to the kirillov - reshetikhin invariants of its @xmath3-skeleton @xmath2 , viewed as a trivalent graph in the topological @xmath16-sphere .",
