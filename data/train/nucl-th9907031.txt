    "a collisionless kinetic equation with time - dependent mean field has been used long ago , first by vlasov and then by landau , to describe plasma oscillations in the high - frequency regime @xcite .",
    "more recently bertsch has proposed to use the same equation to study small - amplitude oscillations in nuclei @xcite .",
    "the approach of vlasov and landau assumes translation invariance of the system under study , extensions of their approach to finite systems have to face the nontrivial problem of which boundary conditions to impose on the fluctuation of the sigle - particle density distribution @xmath0 .",
    "a solution of the linearized vlasov equation suitable for describing giant resonances of various multipolarities in heavy spherical nuclei has been derived in @xcite .",
    "the boundary conditions employed in @xcite are inspired by the steinwedel - jensen ( sj ) model of the giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) ( compressible fluid within fixed boundary , see for example ref.@xcite , p.558 ) . in ref.@xcite",
    "an approach similar to that of ref.@xcite has been followed , but with boundary conditions that are inspired by the goldhaber - teller ( gt ) , rather than by the sj model . in the gt model of the gdr the neutron and proton fluids are assumed to oscillate against each other without being compressed ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite , p. 558 ) .    in order to adopt such a description , the authors of @xcite had to account for the reflection of nucleons on the moving nuclear suface ( assumed to be sharp ) , and this was achieved by modifying the boundary conditions employed in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we first recall the approaches of refs . @xcite and @xcite , giving a unified discussion of the different solutions derived in those papers .",
    "then we consider the condition determining the eigenfrequencies of collective modes that has been derived in ref . @xcite .",
    "since in that paper this condition has been studied in detail only for monopole ( @xmath1 ) oscillations , we turn our attention to the lowest isoscalar modes with @xmath2 . we introduce a low - frequency approximation that allows us to obtain analytical expressions for the dynamic coefficients ( friction and mass parameters ) entering the equation of motion for the surface oscillations of a system of fermions .",
    "these coefficients and the associated eigenfrequencies of collective oscillations are then compared to the analogous expressions given by the liquid - drop model ( ldm ) of ref .",
    "@xcite and by a more closely related model discussed in ref .",
    "in ref . @xcite it has been shown that for a spherical system the solution of the linearized vlasov equation can be reduced to the solution of a one - dimensional problem in the effective potential @xmath3 .    in this section",
    "we briefly compare the approaches of @xcite and @xcite by assuming a one - dimensional model , our aim is to make the connection between the two approaches more transparent .",
    "thus we consider a one - dimensional system described by an equilibrium hamiltonian h_0 ( x)==p^2+u_0 ( x ) . the ( possibly self - consistent ) equilibrium mean field @xmath4 is assumed to have the shape of a potential well , so that the motion of particles is bounded within two classical turning points @xmath5 defined by @xmath6 . in the hartree approximation",
    "the relation between the self - consistent field and the interaction between particles @xmath7 is [ mf ] u_0 ( x)=dxdpv(x - x)n_0 ( x,p ) , with @xmath8 the single - particle phase - space distribution at equilibrium .",
    "we assume that at time @xmath9 this system is acted upon by a weak external field of the type @xmath10 which induces a time - dependent fluctuation of the equilibrium single - particle distribution : @xmath11 . as a consequence the equilibrium mean field also acquires a time - dependence : @xmath12 .",

    "then , according to @xcite , the linearized vlasov equation implies [ sis ] n_+(x , , ) - a(x,,)n_+ ( x,,)=b_+ ( x , , ) + n_- ( x,,)+ a(x,,)n_- ( x,,)=b_- ( x , , ) with [ af ] a(x,,)=i and [ bterm ] b_(x,,)= ( n_0 ) [ dq(x)+ u(x , ) ] .",
    "the solution of the system ( [ sis ] ) is not completely trivial because the fluctuation of the mean field u(x,)=dxdpv(x - x)[n_+ ( x, , ) + n_- ( x, , ) ] couples the two equations . in the approach of @xcite the solution",
    "is obtained in two steps , first the mean field fluctuation in ( [ bterm ] ) is neglected , thus obtaining a zero - order solution @xmath16 that can be derived explicitly , then the solution with the full inhomogeneous term ( [ bterm ] ) is expressed in implicit form through an integral equation similar to that given by the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) for the particle - hole green function .",
    "of course the zero - order solution @xmath16 depends on the boundary conditions .",
    "the conditions employed in @xcite were [ fs ] n_+(x_1(2),,)= n_-(x_1(2 ) , , ) . in this case",
    "the solution of the system ( [ sis ] ) ( neglecting mean - field fluctuations ) becomes [ no ] n^0 _",
    "( x,,)=e^i(x ) [ _ x_1^xdx b^0 ( x , ) e^i(x )  +  c ( ) ] , with @xmath17 $ ] , ( x)=_x_1^x dy 1  , c()=e^it_x_1^x_2 dx b^0 ( x , ) e^-i(x)- _",

    "@xcite it has been argued that the effects of moving boundary can be taken into account , at least in a linearized approximation , simply by changing the boundary conditions ( [ fs ] ) . in particular , since we are interested in the radial motion of nucleons in the effective potential @xmath19 , it is sufficient to change the boundary condition at one turning point ( say @xmath20 ) .",
    "thus , instead of the boundary conditions ( [ fs ] ) , in @xcite the following boundary conditions have been used [ ms ] n_+(x_1,,)= n_-(x_1 , , )   + n_+(x_2,,)= n_-(x_2,,)+ ( n_0)f ( ) , where @xmath21 is the fourier transform of an as yet undetermined function of time @xmath22 .",

    "the moving - boundary solution is more complicated since the pole structure of @xmath31 is not as simple as that of @xmath24 .",
    "apart from the usual poles at @xmath32 , the quantity @xmath31 can have additional poles due to @xmath21 , and these extra poles may contribute to the contour integral . the problem of determining the explicit form of @xmath22 , and consequently the pole structure of @xmath21 , will be discussed in the next section .",
    "in this section we recall the approach followed in ref . @xcite in order to determine the pole structure of the additional term in the boundary condition ( [ ms ] ) .",
    "the approach of @xcite is inspired by the ldm @xcite , the nuclear mean field is approximated by a square - well type potential , but , contrary to ref .",
    "@xcite , in this model the external field is allowed to change also the equilibrium shape of the nucleus .",
    "the change of shape is parametrized as @xmath33 , with r(,,t)=_lm r_lm(t ) y_lm ( , ) . in the ldm",

    "this result might offer a qualitative explanation for the background observed in inelastic proton scattering at small angle , that has been previously studied by assuming a semi - infinite model @xcite , @xcite .",
    "different solutions of the linearized vlasov equation for finite systems can be obtained , depending on the boundary conditions imposed on the fluctuations of the single - particle phase - space density .",
    "we have discussed two different solutions ( with fixed and moving surface ) that can be useful in studying collective nuclear excitations . in particular",
    "we have analyzed the moving - surface solution in the low - frequency limit for the first few isoscalar nuclear modes ( monopole , dipole , quadrupole and octupole ) and have derived interesting analytical expressions for the friction and mass parameters entering the equation of motion for the oscillations of the nuclear surface . according to our semiclassical result , in the low - frequency limit , nuclear dissipation is due only to nucleons moving along closed classical trajectories .",
    "numerically our friction parameters are in rather good agreement with those derived in ref .",
    "for the mass parameters our result agree only partially with those of @xcite , like in that case we find a divergence of the mass parameters for even multipolarity , but our parameters can be complex , with a finite imaginary part . for odd multipolarities ( dipole and octupole ) our mass parameters do agree with those of ref . @xcite .",
    "thus , even though the formalism is quite different , we conclude that the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , is substantially equivalent to that of ref .",
    "@xcite . on the contrary we find several differences with respect to the classical hydrodynamic results of ref .",
    "these differences , the most imporant being probably the landau damping of surface oscillations , can be ascribed to the fact that the properties of a fluid of fermions are , even in a semiclassical description , different from those of a classical fluid .",
