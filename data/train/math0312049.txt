    "recall that we can attach to @xmath1 a compatible family of galois representations @xmath17 of the absolute galois group of @xmath18 : these representations can be seen as those attached to the weil restriction @xmath19 of @xmath1 to @xmath18 , which is an abelian surface with real multiplication by @xmath20 ( cf .",
    "let us call @xmath21 the set of primes dividing @xmath22 . for primes not in @xmath21 ,",
    "it is clear that @xmath19 is also semistable , so in particular for every prime @xmath23 of @xmath24 dividing a prime @xmath25 not in @xmath21 the residual representation @xmath26 will be a representation  semistable outside @xmath21 \" , i.e. , it will be semistable ( in the sense of [ ri 97 ] ) at @xmath25 and locally at every prime @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",

    "+ imitating the argument of [ ri97 ] , we want to show that in this situation , if the image of @xmath33 is ( irreducible and ) contained in the normalizer of a cartan subgroup , then this cartan subgroup must correspond to the image of the galois group of @xmath2 , i.e. , the restriction to @xmath2 of @xmath33 must be reducible . more precisely :    [ teo : firstcase ] let @xmath1 be a semistable q - curve over a quadratic field @xmath2 as above .",

    "[ ri 97 ] ) .",
    "+ using the description of the restriction of @xmath26 to the inertia group @xmath43 in terms of fundamental characters , and the fact that the restriction of @xmath26 to the inertia groups @xmath31 , for every @xmath44 , @xmath45 , is unipotent , we conclude as in [ ri 97 ] that the quadratic character @xmath42 can only ramify at primes in @xmath21 , and therefore that the quadratic field @xmath40 is unramified outside @xmath21 , the ramification set of @xmath2 .",
    "+ on the other hand , we know ( by cebotarev ) that the restriction to @xmath46 of @xmath26 is isomorphic to @xmath47 .",
    "let us assume that @xmath47 is irreducible ( * ) .",
    "its image is contained in @xmath39 , and since the restriction of @xmath26 to @xmath41 is reducible , it follows that the restriction of @xmath47 to @xmath48 is reducible .",
    "we are again in the case of  image contained in the normalizer of a cartan subgroup \" but now for a representation of @xmath46 .",
    "once again , the quadratic character @xmath49 corresponding to the extension @xmath50 is a quotient of the residual representation @xmath47 .",
    "using the fact that the curve @xmath1 is semistable we know that the restriction of this residual representation to all inertia subgroups at places relatively primes to @xmath25 give unipotent groups , and this implies as in [ ri97 ] that @xmath49 is unramified outside ( places above ) @xmath25 .",
    "but @xmath49 corresponds to the extension @xmath51 , and @xmath40 is unramified outside @xmath21 , thus @xmath49 is also unramified outside ( places above primes in ) @xmath21 .",
    "this two facts entrain that @xmath52 , which is contrary to our hypothesis .",
    "+ this proves that the assumption ( * ) contradicts the hypothesis of the theorem , i.e. , that the restriction to @xmath46 of @xmath26 is reducible , as we wanted .",
    "keep the hypothesis of the theorem above , and assume furthermore that the field @xmath2 is real .",
    "then , the conclusion of the theorem together with a standard trick show that the image of @xmath26 can not be ( irreducible and ) contained in the normalizer of a non - split cartan subgroup : the reason is simply that the representation @xmath53 is odd , thus the image of @xmath54 , the complex conjugation , has eigenvalues @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "in odd residual characteristic , this gives an elements which is not contained in a non - split cartan , but if we assume that @xmath2 is real , we have @xmath54 contained in the group @xmath46 , and we obtain a contradiction because as a consequence of theorem [ teo : firstcase ] the restriction of @xmath26 to @xmath46 must be contained in the cartan subgroup .",
    "this , combined with ellenberg s generalizations of the results of mazur and momose ( cf .",
