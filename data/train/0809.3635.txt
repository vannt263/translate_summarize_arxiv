    "the main conjecture in de broglie s thesis is  _ the existence of a periodic phenomenon of an unknown nature , associated to every portion of isolated energy , and related to its proper mass by planck - einstein s equation _",
    "@xcite , so that a particle of mass @xmath5 at rest should have an internal frequency @xmath6 and when the particle moves at a velocity @xmath7 this frequency will be @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the relativistic time dilation factor . properly speaking , a moving electron has a greater energy @xmath10 and therefore a greater frequency @xmath11 according to the above statement , but if this internal periodic motion has a physical reality will have the frequency proposed by de broglie @xmath8 when measured by an inertial observer who sees the electron moving at the speed @xmath7 , and according to the time dilation of special relativity .    using this conjecture , gouanre et al .",
    "@xcite tried to get evidence of this electron internal clock frequency by analysing the interaction of a beam of electrons with the atoms of a @xmath12 m thick silicon crystal aligned along the @xmath13 direction . if the momentum of the electron beam is the appropiate , they will interact in a kind of transversal resonant scattering , whenever the distance travelled by the electron during a period @xmath14 will be related to the separation @xmath15 between the atoms of the crystal .",
    "when @xmath16 this will produce a lateral force such that the outgoing beam in the forward direction will show a decrease in the number of outgoing electrons for that resonant momentum @xmath17 .",
    "this resonant momentum is @xmath18 mev@xmath1 while their experiment shows a value of @xmath19 mev@xmath1 , a 0.28% higher than the predicted theoretical value ( see figure  [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "their monte carlo calculation , using parabolic potentials to describe the atomic structures , shows a bad fitting with the experimental result for this internal frequency ( curve ( a ) of figure  [ fig:1 ] ) , while a clear matching ( curve ( b ) of figure  [ fig:1 ] ) , except for the above 0.28% shift , between the expected and the experimental outcome for a momentum range between @xmath20 mev@xmath1 and @xmath21 mev@xmath1 and when the electron frequency is taken twice de broglie s frequency @xmath22 or @xmath23 .",
    "this resonant momentum is @xmath24 mev@xmath1 , it is outside of the experiment range , and the observed peak corresponds to the second harmonic .",
    "this frequency corresponds to the zitterbewegung frequency or frequency found by dirac of the internal motion of the electron .",
    "transcription of figure 4 of 2008 reference @xcite , which shows the experimental outcome of the detected number of electrons versus the linear momentum @xmath17 of the electron beam in mev@xmath1 ( dotted line ) .",
    "curve ( a ) represents their monte carlo calculation for de broglie s frequency @xmath25 .",
    "curve ( b ) represents their monte carlo calculation by considering that the electron internal frequency is twice de broglie s frequency @xmath22 .",
    "it matches with the experimental result except for a shift from @xmath26 mev@xmath1 to @xmath27 mev@xmath1,width=264 ]    we are going to produce this analysis based upon a classical electron model found from a very general formalism for describing spinning particles @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite , we have given different arguments justifying that the centre of charge and centre of mass of a spinning particle are different points , and , for the electron at rest , the centre of charge is moving in circles , at the speed of light , around the centre of mass with a frequency @xmath28 , twice as much as de broglie s frequency and coherently matched with dirac s internal frequency .",
    "this internal frequency changes as @xmath29 when the electron moves , because of the special relativity time dilation .",
    "it is this relative motion of the centre of charge which has a clear interpretation as the schroedinger s zitterbewegung , and therefore a clear internal periodic phenomenon associated to a spinning particle .",
    "in the kinematical formalism @xcite , an elementary particle is , by definition , a mechanical system which in addition to being indivisible , as a consequence of the atomic hypothesis @xcite , it can never be deformed so that all allowed states are only kinematical modifications of any one of them .",
    "this means that when the state of an elementary particle changes there exists another inertial observer who measures the particle in the same state as before .",
    "this means that in a variational approach of classical physics , the initial @xmath30 and final @xmath31 states of the evolution of an elementary particle must be related by a transformation of the kinematical group @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , the boundary variables of the variational approach , necessarily span a homogeneous space of the kinematical group of space - time symmetries . when quantizing all classical systems characterized by such homogeneous spaces , their hilbert space of pure states carries a projective unitary irreducible representation of the kinematical group @xcite .",
    "it thus satisfies wigner s definition of a quantum elementary particle .    in this way",
    ", the parameters of the kinematical group become the classical variables we use , as the boundary values of the variational formalism for describing an elementary particle . in the relativistic and non - relativistic approach , these variables are reduced to the ten variables @xmath33 and @xmath34 , interpreted respectively as the time , position of the charge , velocity of the charge and orientation of the particle . in the relativistic case",
    "we have three disjoint , maximal homogeneous spaces of the poincar group spanned by these variables with the constraint either @xmath35 , @xmath36 or @xmath37 .",
    "it is the manifold with @xmath36 , as suggested by the kinematical analysis of reference @xcite , which leads to dirac s equation when quantizing the system .",
    "this kinematical analysis states the possibility that the centre of mass and centre of charge of a spinning particle could be different points . in that case",
    ", the centre of charge has necessarily a velocity of constant absolute value , unreachable by any inertial observer , so that only the relativistic approach is selected and the charge moves at the speed @xmath38 .",
    "the lagrangian depends on these ten kinematical variables and also on the acceleration of the point @xmath39 and on the angular velocity . for a dirac particle ,",
    "the charge located at point @xmath39 is moving at the speed of light @xmath36 .",
    "the classical expression linear in the energy @xmath40 and in the linear momentum @xmath41 , which gives rise to dirac s equation is @xmath42 where the energy @xmath40 is expressed as the sum of two terms , @xmath43 , or translational energy and the other , which depends on the spin of the system , or rotational energy .",
    "the spin comes from the dependence of the lagrangian @xmath44 of both , the acceleration @xmath45 , and the angular velocity @xmath46 , and if we define @xmath47 it takes the form @xmath48 the first part @xmath49 , or _ zitterbewegung _",
    "part , is related to the separation between the centre of charge from the centre of mass and takes into account this relative orbital motion .",
    "it quantizes with integer values .",
    "the second part @xmath50 is the rotational part of the body frame and quantizes with both integer and half - integer values .",
    "the total angular momentum with respect to the origin of observer s frame is @xmath51 so that the spin @xmath52 is the angular momentum of the system with respect to the centre of charge @xmath39 , and not with respect to the centre of mass @xmath53 . by this reason",
    ", it is not a conserved quantity for a free particle , but satisfies the dynamical equation @xmath54 this is the same dynamical equation satisfied by dirac s spin operator in the quantum case .    when expressed dirac s spin @xmath52 and the centre of mass position @xmath53 in terms of the velocity and acceleration of the charge they take , respectively , the form @xmath55 dirac s spin is always orthogonal to the osculator plane of the trajectory of the charge @xmath39 , in the direction opposite to the binormal for a positive energy particle , and in the opposite direction for the antiparticle .",
    "this implies a difference in chirality between matter and antimatter .",
    "point @xmath53 is always different from point @xmath39 , because the observable @xmath56 thus justifying the conjecture that for a spinning particle the centre of mass and centre of charge are different points .",
    "the acceleration of the charge is pointing from @xmath39 to the centre of mass @xmath53 , as it corresponds to a helix .",
    "it is shown that the dynamical equation of point @xmath39 for the free particle and in the centre of mass frame is given by @xmath57 where the spin vector @xmath52 is constant in this frame , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",

    "the magnetic moment of the particle is produced by the motion of the charge .",
    "the frequency of this internal motion in this frame is @xmath28 .",
    "the total spin @xmath52 is half the value of the zitterbewegung part @xmath62 when quantizing the sytem , so that when expressing the magnetic moment in terms of the total spin we get a @xmath63 gyromagnetic ratio @xcite .",
    "the body frame attached to the point @xmath39 rotates with angular velocity @xmath64 , has not been depicted.,width=264 ]    when seen from an arbitrary observer ( see figure  [ fig:4 ] ) , the motion of the charge for a longitudinaly polarized electron is a helix , so that according to ( [ eq : dynspin ] ) dirac s spin precess around the direction of the conserved linear momentum @xmath41 .",
    "the spin with respect to the centre of mass is defined as @xmath65 it is a conserved quantity for a free particle .",
    "the centre of mass velocity is @xmath66 , and the linear momentum is written as usual as @xmath67 .",
    "this means that the transversal motion of the charge is at the velocity @xmath68 .",
    "the centre of charge of a moving electron takes a time @xmath69 times longer than for an electron at rest to complete a turn , which is a clear consequence of the time dilation .",
    "the faster the centre of mass of the electron moves the slower is the rotation frequency of the centre of charge around the centre of mass .",

    "the spin with respect to the centre of mass @xmath70 , is a constant of the motion for a free particle.,width=264 ]",
    "in figure [ si ] we show the unit cell of a silicon crystal and the separation @xmath71 between neighbouring atoms on the @xmath72 plane along which the electron beam is sent in the gouanre et al . experiment @xcite . in the figure [ fig:2 ]",
    "we show two possible free motions of a polarized electron . in part",
    "( a ) we describe the motion of the centre of mass and centre of charge of an electron polarized along the direction of motion @xmath73 . in part ( b )",
    "the electron is polarized perpendicularly to the page along the @xmath74 axis . in both cases",
    "the centre of mass motion is in the direction @xmath13 of the crystalographic plane , where the dots represent the location of the si nuclei on that plane . for electrons polarized along the @xmath75 direction , where the centre of charge motion is contained in the plane @xmath76 ,",
    "the description is equivalent to the last one , where the atoms will be arranged on the @xmath76 plane .",
    "the frequency of the internal motion of a moving electron is @xmath77 , so that the distance travelled by the centre of mass during a period is @xmath78 . there will be a resonant scattering whenever @xmath79 or when @xmath80 for any natural number @xmath81 . in the first case ,",
    "the particle moves faster and there will be a resonant interaction every @xmath82th atom , while in the second case the momentum will be smaller , the particle will interact with each atom but every @xmath83 periods of the electron .",
    "the previsible values of these momenta are @xmath84 @xmath85 @xmath86 in the gouanre et al .",
    "experiment @xcite the range of the electron beam was prepared between 54 to 110 mev@xmath1 , so that only the resonant frequency for @xmath3 , 80.874 mev@xmath1 was available within that range , although they mention that _ an observation could also be possible at harmonic frequencies , for example at corresponding momenta of 161.748 mev@xmath1 and 40.437 mev@xmath1 , etc .",
    ", probably with reduced intensity._.    our conjecture is that the momenta of small value @xmath4 are more favorable to produce a larger transversal scattering because the velocity of the beam is smaller , the particle remains in the crystal a longer time and the interaction is produced with every atom , and , therefore , the ratio of the transversal momentum transfer to the longitudinal momentum of the beam is larger , so that a greater number of electrons will be withdrawn from the forward direction , while for the larger momenta @xmath87 the ratio of the transversal perturbation to the longitudinal velocity is smaller and only a smaller number of atoms participate in the resonant scattering .",
    "this means that smaller the momenta the larger the depth of the counts of the resonant peak .    for very small @xmath4 , and depending on the experimental resolution",
    ", it will be difficult to discriminate among the corresponding resonance peaks .",
    "for example , for @xmath88 and 101 , the corresponding momenta are @xmath89 which differ from each other of around @xmath90 mev@xmath1 which seems to be smaller than the resolution of the experiment .",
