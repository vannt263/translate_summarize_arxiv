    "since the cosmic star formation history in galaxies from high - redshift to the present day is one of important measurements for the understanding of both formation and evolution of galaxies , a number of observational studies have been made for this decade ( e.g. , madau et al .",

    "; bouwens & illingworth 2006 ; see also hopkins 2004 ; hopkins & beacom 2006 ) .",
    "although much interest has been addressed to the star formation in higher - redshift universe , large programs of spectroscopic surveys have provided important observations of galaxies located in lower - redshift universe ; e.g. , canada - france redshift survey ( cfrs : lilly et al .",
    "1995 , 1996 ; tresse & maddox 1998 ; tresse et al .",
    "2002 ) , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss : york et al .",
    "2000 ; salim et al . 2007 ) , the vimos vlt deep survey ( vvds : le fevre et al .",
    "2005 ; tresse et al . 2007 ) .",
    "all these observations have provided us a rough trend of the cosmic star formation history from high-@xmath17 to the present day : the star - formation rate density ( sfrd , @xmath18 ) rises from @xmath19 to @xmath20 , is nearly constant between @xmath21 and @xmath22 and decline at @xmath23 .",
    "recent observations by the _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( galex ) and the _ spitzer space telescope _ have confirmed that @xmath18 increases from @xmath24 to @xmath25 ( e.g. , schiminovich et al . 2005 ; le floch et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "remaining problems include the faint - end and luminous - end of the luminosity function and clustering properties of star - forming galaxies . for this purpose ,",
    "deep imaging observations with a narrowband filter are highly useful because such surveys could probe fainter star - forming galaxies by detecting their h@xmath0 emission .",
    "the h@xmath0 luminosity is directly connected to the ionizing photon production rate . in particular , wide - field imagers on 8 m class telescopes , such as suprime - cam on the subaru telescope ( miyazaki et al .",
    "2002 ) are most suitable because of their superior observational capability .    in this paper , we present our new search for faint h@xmath0 emitting galaxies at @xmath14 in the subaru deep field ( sdf : kashikawa et al . 2004 ) .",
    "one of the uniqueness of the sdf is the field is its very wide field of view ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "another uniqueness is that deep photometry in narrowband filters has been carried out .",
    "since the sdf is one of the deepest fields observed so far by ground - based telescopes , we can probe much fainter star - forming galaxies .",
    "although the sky coverage of sdf is fairly wide , it is difficult to sample a statistically significant number of bright h@xmath0 emitters .",
    "this makes it difficult to obtain a reliable h@xmath0 luminosity function ( h@xmath0lf ) because of large ambiguity in the bright end of luminosity function .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we also use the sdss data to probe the bright - end of the luminosity function of h@xmath0 emitters in the same redshift range .",
    "we note that ly et al .",
    "( 2007 , hereafter l07 ) discussed low and intermediate redshift nb704 , nb711 , nb816 , and nb921 emitters in the sdf using the official photometric catalogs . since their selection criteria are different from those of this work , it is hard to compare with our previous work ( shioya et al .",
    "2008 , hereafter s08 ) .",
    "we therefore reanalyze the public catalog of the sdf .",
    "details of the differences between our sample and the sample of l07 are discussed in the following section .    throughout this paper ,",
    "magnitudes are given in the ab system .",
    "we adopt a flat universe with @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "the sdf project is a very deep optical imaging survey using the suprime - cam ( miyazaki et al.2002 ) on the 8.2 m subaru telescope ( kaifu et al .",
    "2000 ; iye et al .",
    "2004 ) at mauna kea observatories .",
    "the sdf is located near the north galactic pole , being centered at @xmath0(j2000 ) = @xmath30 and @xmath31(j2000 ) = @xmath32 .",
    "details of the sdf project are given in kashikawa et al.(2004 ) .",
    "the sdf official photometric catalog is obtained from the sdf site ( http://step.mtk.nao.ac.jp/sdf/project/ ) .",
    "this official catalog contains 5 broadband ( @xmath33 , and @xmath34 ) and 2 narrowband ( @xmath2 and @xmath35 ) photometric data . in this work ,",
    "we use an @xmath6-selected catalog with @xmath36 diameter aperture photometry .",
    "the psf size in this catalog is 0.98 arcsec ( kashikawa et al .",
    "the @xmath37 limiting magnitudes , which are measured as @xmath37 of the sky noise on a @xmath36 diameter aperture , are @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , respectively . since the galactic extinction is not corrected in the magnitudes in the official catalog , we applied the galactic extinction correction of @xmath44 ( schlegel et al .",
    "a photometric correction for each band is as follows : @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .    in this work ,",
    "we use the narrowband filter , @xmath2 , centered at 8150    with the passband of @xmath51(fwhm ) = 120  .",
    "the central wavelength of this filter corresponds to a redshift of 0.24 for h@xmath0 emission .",
    "therefore , together with the broadband filter data , we can carry out a deep search for h@xmath0 emitters at @xmath52 0.24 in sdf .      in order to select @xmath2-excess objects",
    ", it would be desirable to have a frequency - matched continuum . since the effective frequency of the @xmath2 filter ( 367.8 thz ) is different either from those of @xmath6 ( 349.9 thz ) and @xmath7 ( 333.6 thz ) filters , we newly make a frequency - matched continuum , `` @xmath53 continuum '' , for each object using the following linear combination ; @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the @xmath6- and @xmath7-band flux densities , respectively .",
    "its 3 @xmath57 limiting magnitude is @xmath58 in a @xmath36 diameter aperture .",
    "this enables us to more precisely estimate the continuum magnitude at the same effective wavelength as that of the @xmath2 filter .",
    "however , in sdf public catalog , the median of @xmath59 is 0.08 for objects with @xmath60 .",
    "we therefore corrected the @xmath2 magnitude ; @xmath61(pub)+0.08 , where @xmath2(pub ) is magnitude of @xmath2 in sdf public catalog .",
    "from now on , we use this @xmath2 magnitude .",
    "we note that the median of @xmath62 measured by l07 ( 0.1 ) is slightly larger than our measurement .",
    "we consider that the different definition of @xmath53 continuum makes the difference of the median of @xmath59 .    following the manner of previous surveys using a narrowband filter ( fujita et al .",
    "2003 , hereafter f03 ; l07 ; s08 ) and taking the scatter in the @xmath63 color and our survey depth into account , candidate line - emitting objects are selected with the criteria of @xmath64 and @xmath65 . in order to avoid the influence of saturation of brighter objects , we have adopted a criterion of @xmath66 .",
    "we note that @xmath67 is determined from intersection point of @xmath68 .",
    "we compute the @xmath69 of the @xmath63 color as @xmath70 .",
    "we also note that @xmath71 corresponds to @xmath72  .",
    "these criteria are shown by the vertical dotted lines , the horizontal solid line , and the dashed curve in figure [ nbexcess ] .",
    "we then find 2072 sources that satisfy the above criteria .",

    "we discuss the differences between our sample and the sample of l07 in section 2.5",
    ".      a narrowband survey of emission - line galaxies can potentially detect galaxies with different emission lines at different redshifts .",
    "the emission lines that can be detected in the @xmath2 passband are h@xmath0+[nii ] , h@xmath74 , [ o iii ] @xmath754959 , 5007 , [ o ii ] @xmath763727 , [ s ii ] @xmath75 6717 , 6731 , and ly@xmath0 . since the flux ratio of [ s ii]@xmath75 6717 , 6731/(h@xmath0 + [ n ii ] @xmath77 6548,6584 ) is low in general ( @xmath78 : ho , fillippenko , & sargent 1997 ; see also murayama & taniguchi 1998 ; nagao et al .",
