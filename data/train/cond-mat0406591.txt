    "a typical example in chemistry is the movement of reaction fronts . in physics",
    "the movement of domain walls is directly related to the problem of coarsening , for example in magnetic systems . in ref .",
    "@xcite the phenomenon of hysteresis in a driven diffusive system is explained by the movement of shocks , i.e. , a jump in the density profile .",
    "various other phenomena in many particle systems can be attributed to the emergence of shocks , for example the first order transition in the phase diagram of the asymmetric exclusion process ( asep ) @xcite or phase coexistence in a driven diffusive system coupled to reaction kinetics @xcite .",
    "recently , shocks in quantum systems have also been discussed @xcite .    on a macroscopic level shock fronts are described by partial differential equations .",
    "the most prominent equations are the fisher and the burgers equations .",
    "the fisher equation @xcite @xmath0 was originally proposed as a model for the propagation of a mutant gene .",
    "it shows traveling wave solutions and may be used for modeling systems without conservation of the order parameter .    the inviscid burgers equation @xcite @xmath1\\ ] ]",
    "was proposed as a model for turbulent fluid motion .",
    "it as well shows shock solutions , but it may be used for modeling systems with particle conservation .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate for some models how these macroscopic shocks originate from the microscopic dynamics .",
    "it is known that some driven diffusive systems can be described by the fisher or burgers equation in the hydrodynamic limit .",
    "this limit is achieved by scaling the lattice constant to zero while keeping the overall length of the system constant , the time has to be rescaled appropriately .",
    "one of these models is the asep which is in the hydrodynamic limit described by the burgers equation .",
    "another model is the branching and coalescing random walk , which is in the hydrodynamic limit described by the fisher equation @xcite . in these two models",
    "the microscopic dynamics can be described by exact shock measures .",
    "an exact shock measure is a state where two product measures with different densities are connected .",
    "the time evolution of this state is given by a diffusion equation with respect to the position of the density step @xcite .",
    "in particular this implies that the microscopic structure of the system is known at all times .",
    "the physical properties of large classes of one  species reaction  diffusion models with _",
    "nearest neighbor _ interactions have been widely studied @xcite .",
    "there are only four known models which show shocks without correlations @xcite : the asep , the branching and coalescing random walk ( bcrw ) , the asymmetric kawasaki ",
    "glauber process ( akgp ) and the brick layer model .",
    "while the former three models are exclusion models where the number of particles on each lattice site is restricted to at most one , the particle number is not restricted in the latter one . here",
    ", the investigation shall be extended to three ",
    "site interaction exclusion models @xcite and it will be shown that three  site interactions give rise to models with exact shock measures which show aspects not seen in nearest neighbor models , viz .",
    "double shocks and additional symmetries even though no free fermion condition is met .    at this point",
    "we remark that the question of phase separation is directly linked to the movement of domain walls because coarsening is generic for this phenomenon .",
    "but although some of the models presented in this paper show growing domains we will argue that this mechanism can not be used for constructing nonequilibrium models with two species ( one type of particles and vacancies ) showing phase separation in one dimension @xcite .",
    "we present a survey of one  species models with three  site interactions and open boundaries whose time evolution is described by an exact diffusive shock measure , to be defined below . for the cases of shocks between two nonfluctuating phases ( densities 0 to 1 ) and two fluctuating phases",
    "( both densities are different from 0 and 1 ) the list is complete . for the case of a shock from a nonfluctuating phase ( density 0 or 1 ) to a fluctuating phase ( density between 0 and 1 ) the variety of models is too large to give a complete survey  the number of free parameters rises from 12 to 56 when the interaction range is increased from two to three .",
    "but we present a classification of models with respect to their symmetries , where we considered models where at least two of the symmetries charge ( @xmath2 ) , parity ( @xmath3 ) and time ( @xmath4 ) are valid independently .",
    "we also address the question to what extent the description of the dynamics of the model by the movement of shock fronts is sufficient . to this end",
    "the interactions of the domain walls are determined and possible parallels to free fermion systems are discussed .",
    "on each lattice site @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) of a one  dimensional lattice there may be at most one particle ( @xmath7 ) or a vacancy ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "one can also consider these two  state systems as spin systems , a particle is represented by a down spin ( @xmath9 ) and a vacancy by an up spin ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the stochastic dynamics of the models are defined by a master equation @xcite which is conveniently expressed in the quantum ",
    "hamiltonian formalism for spin1/2 chains as described in ref .  @xcite .",
    "to each lattice configuration @xmath11 we assign a basis vector @xmath12 which is given by the tensor product of the single  site states .",
    "the probability vector describing the system can then be written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the probability at time @xmath15 to find the system in the state @xmath11 .",
    "the time evolution of the system is described by a master equation which can be written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the stochastic generator of the process . due to the analogy of equation ( [ 3pww : mg ] ) to the schrdinger equation ( in imaginary time ) @xmath17 is often called the hamiltonian of the system .",
    "conservation of probability requires that the sum of the entries of each column is zero , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the so - called summation vector .    for finite interaction range and spatially homogeneous kinetics",
    "it is convenient to write the generator as @xmath20 where the local hamiltonians @xmath21 contain the rates of the elementary local transitions and @xmath22 , @xmath23 account for events at the left respectively right boundary .",
    "the operators @xmath24 include only operators acting on the sites @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 ; the operators @xmath28 include only operators acting on @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "they are formulated using the particle number operator ( @xmath29 ) , vacancy number operator ( @xmath30 ) , the particle creation ( @xmath31 ) and annihilation ( @xmath32 ) operators .",
    "the lower index represents the lattice site on which the respective operator acts .",
    "the diagonal entries of the hamiltonian have to be chosen such that conservation of probability is fulfilled which can be easily constructed by considering @xmath33 for example diffusion to the right ( @xmath34 ) with rate @xmath35 is written as @xmath36 .",
    "in what follows @xmath37 denotes a probability vector for a single site and an operator without index a single site operator .",
    "if no correlations are present the probability vectors are simply given by @xmath38 with @xmath39 in this case the calculation of the action of the stochastic generator @xmath17 can be simplified by using the following identities : @xmath40 a product measure @xmath41 is a stationary state of the system , if @xmath42    as a shock measure @xmath43 we define the state which is a product measure with density @xmath44 up to and including site @xmath5 and beginning from site @xmath45 a product measure with density @xmath46 : @xmath47 we are interested in those systems , for which the time evolution of the shock measure is given by a diffusion equation ( see figure  [ 3pww : fig1 ] ) @xmath48 starting from an initial density step the system will evolve into an exact diffusive shock measure defined by @xmath49 which is a time dependent superposition of sharp shocks weighted with @xmath50 .",
    "this can be seen by solving eq .",
    "( [ 3pww : shockdiff ] ) for an initial shock at position @xmath5 : @xmath51 @xmath52 is the green s function for this problem , for large arguments @xmath53 and late times it approaches a gaussian , as expected for a diffusion problem . from eq .",
    "( [ 3pww : diff_sol ] ) we read off @xmath54 .    if we choose a shock measure ( [ 3pww : shockmeasure ] ) as initial condition of a system which obeys eq .",
    "( [ 3pww : shockdiff ] ) the form of the shock is preserved in time but due to the diffusion the state of the system will evolve into a superposition of shocks .",
    "thus when performing an ensemble average the density profile is not a sharp step but smears out in time ( see figure [ 3pww : fig2 ] ) as seen in monte ",
    "carlo ( mc ) simulations .",
    "nevertheless a typical configuration of a single systems shows a sharp shock .",
    "( [ 3pww : shockdiff ] ) directly gives the diffusion coefficient @xmath55 and the shock velocity @xmath56 : @xmath57    the product measures to the left and to the right of the shock position are only possible for a special choice of boundary dynamics @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "a possible choice is always those boundary dynamics which is the effect of reservoirs with densities @xmath44 respectively @xmath46",
    "@xcite : one imagines that the lattice is extended by two additional sites at each boundary and one calculates the action of @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) assuming that the sites are occupied according to the product measures in the bulk and determines the effective rates for the boundary action .",

    "we always consider the limit @xmath67 such that the shock is assumed not to hit the boundaries",
    ".    given specific microscopic processes we test for the existence of diffusive shock measures by the following procedure :    a.   check whether @xmath68 is a product measure of the system with periodic boundaries .",

    "the requirement of a product measure ( [ 3pww : enum_a ] ) leads to the condition that the application of the hamiltonian of the periodic system has to produce `` telescope''sums of diagonal operators which results in five equations of the rates for each density .",
    "condition [ 3pww : enum_e ] ) can be checked using the identity @xmath84 and analogous identities for @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 . a comparison of coefficients of the ( only diagonal ) operators on the left and right hand site of eq .",
    "( [ 3pww : eq_e ] ) then leads to another seven equations of the rates , @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) and @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "conservation of probability implies @xmath92 which is not an additional equation but simplifies the calculation .",
    "if one of the densities is either zero or one , the hamiltonian can not be brought to diagonal form using eqs .",
    "( [ 3pww : eq_diagtrans ] ) and ( [ 3pww : eq_km ] ) .",
    "but in this case the action of the hamiltonian simplifies and an analogous comparison of coefficients of creation and annihilation operators is possible .",
    "in order to find the models with three  site interactions which exhibit shock diffusion one could in principle try to solve eq .",
    "( [ 3pww : shockdiff ] ) for the general hamiltonian .",
    "but as there are 56 microscopic processes ( transitions from any of the @xmath93 states to any different state ) this task is tedious .",
    "we facilitate the procedure by writing a computer program which does all the symbolical calculation ( transformation of the hamiltonian into diagonal form , gathering of coefficients ) and sets up the constituting set of equations .",
    "these equations are then solved by standard mathematical software .",
    "still , the general solution of the problem is far too complex to extract useful informations .",
    "it is hence useful to investigate physically motivated sub ",
    "classes , as done in the following .      the completely empty lattice , @xmath96 , and the fully occupied one , @xmath97 , are nonfluctuating states .",
    "they are the two ground states of the zero  temperature ising model . in this case only few processes play a role .",
    "all processes starting from @xmath98 or @xmath99 are forbidden because otherwise product measures with densities @xmath100 and @xmath101 would not be stationary solutions of the system . the processes which act on the configurations @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 are ineffectual because none of these configurations is possible , if the system is initialized with a shock measure .",
    "the remaining processes are @xmath106 the diffusion constants are then given by @xmath107 the solution for a shock between @xmath108 and @xmath109 is obtained by exchanging the roles of particles and holes ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "this dynamics is a generalized zero temperature ising model where the domain wall between spin up and spin down regions diffuses freely .",
    "as the space symmetric processes have no influence on the upward shock they can be included giving rise to a model allowing for both , upward and downward shocks .",
    "all ten rates are independent such that the drift of the domain walls can be chosen freely .      for each hamiltonian with three  site interactions",
    "there is either none , exactly one product measure with a density in the open interval @xmath113 , or infinitely many .",
    "the latter is only possible for particle  conserving hamiltonians .",
    "the proof of this assertion is possible for the case of three  site interactions , but rather technical and is therefore omitted here .",
    "it is based on analyzing the conditions on the rates and densities for the existence of a product measure eq .",
    "( [ 3pww : eq_prodmeas ] ) for the general three  site interaction hamiltonian .",
    "instead we present a general consideration why the existence of two fluctuating stationary product measures is impossible for non particle  conserving hamiltonians .",
    "this is not intended to be a mathematical rigorous proof , it is rather a physical consistency check .",
    "this consideration is related to the positive rates conjecture , see refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us assume that there are two fluctuating stationary densities @xmath114 for a non particle  conserving hamiltonian .",
    "then due to fluctuations there is a finite probability that in the stationary state with density @xmath44 a region of density @xmath46 emerges .",
    "as @xmath44 is a stationary density this region has to be suppressed and vanishes again .",
    "consequently the domain walls @xmath115 and @xmath116 are moving toward each other shortening the domain of @xmath46 .",
    "but if this is the case @xmath46 can not be a stationary state , as a region of @xmath44 emerging in a phase of @xmath46 is growing .",
    "hence the assumption of the existence of two fluctuating stationary densities was wrong .",
    "note that gacs error correcting model @xcite does not represent a counter example for this statement .",
    "it is crucial that product measures are considered : for this case no dynamics is able to determine the length of a one  dimensional domain  the domain growth is independent of the domain size , while phase separation requires a faster growth of larger domains .    in fig .",
    "[ 3pww : fig2 ] the time evolution of a non particle  conserving system is shown . the particle density in the low density region is not stationary and increases until the first shock vanishes .",
    "the second shock disappears due to another mechanism , here the diffusion equation of the shock is not fulfilled and consequently the shock dissolves .",
    "the situation is basically different if particle  conserving hamiltonians are considered . in this case",
    "the system is not ergodic and hence a region of different density can not evolve in the bulk of the system .",
    "consequently several stationary densities are possible .    as non  conserving hamiltonians do not allow for the existence of two fluctuating phases we only need to investigate particle  conserving hamiltonians and recover the solution of the investigation of nearest neighbor interactions , the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) @xcite : @xmath117    the inclusion of next ",
    "nearest neighbor interaction does not lead to further models in this case .      while the existence of two fluctuating stationary states is impossible , the existence of one fluctuating and one non fluctuating",
    "phase is easy to construct .",
    "the density @xmath94 is stationary if all processes from the empty lattice , @xmath98 , are prohibited .",
    "this is a violation of the assumption underlying the positive rates conjecture as certain types of fluctuations are absent .",
    "therefore two stationary states are possible , however , the nonfluctuating phase is unstable and the fluctuating phase will always enlarge at the expense of the nonfluctuating one .    for the existence of a product measure",
    "@xmath118 it is then necessary that as well no process to the empty lattice is present .",
    "apart from these constraints no further processes can be excluded a priori .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case of a shock between @xmath94 to @xmath118 .",
    "the cases of a shock from @xmath108 to @xmath118 can be obtained by exchanging particles and holes , and the case of the fluctuating phase to the left can be obtained by a parity transformation .    as argued above",
    ", the degrees of freedom are too many for a complete investigation and we classify the systems by the symmetries charge ( @xmath2 ) , parity ( @xmath3 ) and time ( @xmath4 ) . in this",
    "context , charge symmetry is the invariance of the microscopic processes under the exchange of particles and holes ( @xmath110 ) , i.e. , for each process in the model there exists the @xmath2-symmetric one with the same rate .",
    "although this picture is quite artificial when applied to particles it is natural in the language of spins where in the absence of an external field the symmetry between the up and down spin is obvious .",

    "time symmetry is the invariance under the transformation of @xmath119 .",
    "a stochastic model is @xmath4invariant if detailed balance with respect to its stationary distribution is fulfilled @xcite , i.e. , these models are able to reach an equilibrium steady state .",
    "this is the case if for all states @xmath120,@xmath121 the transition rates @xmath122 , @xmath123 and probabilities of finding the system in the configurations @xmath124 , @xmath125 , obey the equation @xmath126 , i.e. , there is no net current between states . if the stationary state of a system is a product measure , the validity of detailed balance is easily checked or refuted , because the calculation of the probabilities of the system to be in a specific states is trivial and additionally the absence of correlations permits to investigate only the local rates instead of the configurations of the whole lattice .",
    "one has to distinguish between a combined symmetry , for example @xmath127 , from an independent symmetry , here expressed by the symbol @xmath128 , for example @xmath129 . while in the former case the system is invariant after applying the symmetries one after each other , in the latter case the system is invariant under the symmetries applied each by themselves .",

    "we checked all combinations and found that there is only one model which is @xmath130 symmetric and has an exact diffusive shock measure as solution : @xmath132 in this model diffusion is combined with branching processes which are only possible to a neighboring lattice site if the subsequent site is empty and its reversal , the coalescence process .    due to the @xmath133 symmetry",
    "this model has the property that both the shock from @xmath100 or @xmath101 to @xmath134 and the shock from @xmath134 to @xmath100 or @xmath101 is stable .",
    "hence double shocks @xmath135 and @xmath136 are possible .",
    "we calculated the time evolution of an initial double shock ( @xmath137 ) in a periodic system by a monte carlo simulation as shown in fig .",

    "as calculated the shock moves with a drift of @xmath101 and such that always the fluctuating phase penetrates the non  fluctuating phase .",
    "the shock @xmath138 between site @xmath139 and @xmath100 evolves into two steps , @xmath140 and @xmath141 , since these shocks drift into the nonfluctuating phase and split up . as a consequence of the periodic boundary conditions the two shock fronts moving into the non  fluctuating phase",

    "can be observed : first , both the upward and the downward shock are stable .",
    "second , the fluctuating phase spreads into the nonfluctuating one until the latter finally vanishes .",
    "we remind that due to the superposition of shocks the ensemble average does not exhibit a sharp step although each single realization does .",
    "there are 16 minimal models obeying @xmath143 symmetry , if we exclude those which include the configurations @xmath98 or @xmath99 only 9 remain .",
    "thus in this case 511 combinations have to be checked .",

    "for these two @xmath143 models a downward shock has not necessarily to be stable as it is the case for the models which are @xmath3 symmetric .",
    "indeed , a downward shock is _ not _ stable in the two models because otherwise the space reflected versions of the processes would show a stable upward shock and would constitute additional @xmath143 models .",

    "we restricted ourselves to the case of completely ordered connected phases as initial conditions .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate how a system evolves out of random initial conditions . in this scenario coarsening of the ordered domains or",
    "the emergence of a third stationary state which is fluctuating is possible .",
    "the connection of two fluctuating phases , both densities are between 0 and 1 .",
    "it is argued that in general non  conservative models can not have two fluctuating product measures as solution , in agreement with the positive rates conjecture .",
    "consequently only conservative models have to be investigated and we recover the asep as the most general solution .",
    "hence , the inclusion of three  site interactions does not lead to models not known from the investigation of nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "the connection of a non  fluctuating phase to a fluctuating phase , one density 0 or 1 and one between 0 and 1 . in this case",
    "numerous models exist and we classify the systems with respect to their symmetry .",
    "there is only one model which is @xmath130 invariant , and this is as well the only model which is @xmath133 invariant .",
    "two additional models are found that are @xmath180 invariant and 14 models are found that are @xmath129 invariant .",
    "we stress that the mechanisms of exact shock measures are _ not _ suitable to construct a ( one  species ) model which shows phase separation on a ring . on the one hand , although models with one fluctuating phase and one non  fluctuating phase allow for stable up and downward  shocks , the non  fluctuating phase will always vanish on a ring because the two shock fronts always enlarge the active region . on the other hand conservative models , which in principle allow for shocks between two fluctuating phases ,",
    "are unable to show both up and downward  shocks .",
    "this is a consequence of the collective velocity @xmath181 which describes the movement of the center of mass of a disturbance in a region of a certain density @xmath182 . in order",
    "that a shock is stable a disturbance has to tend toward the shock , @xmath183 , where @xmath56 is the shock velocity .",
    "obviously this equation can only hold either for the upward or the downward  shock .",
    "note that this consideration only holds for short  ranged , homogeneous one  species models , it is known that phase separation is possible in models with defects @xcite or several species of particles @xcite .    although it is shown that double shocks @xmath184 are possible we argue that this can not be used to construct models which show phase separation in one  dimensional , short  ranged periodic systems with a single species .",
    "we have also investigated the influence of shock fronts on each other .",
    "a case of special interest is when the fronts move independently , except for the possibility of mutual annihilation . in the @xmath130 model",
    "this can not be observed , it turns out that it has to be combined with an additional process violating @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "but by this the bcrw which is a two  site interaction model is recovered for which the independence of shock fronts is known .",
    "we conclude that there is no direct connection of models whose time evolution is given by exact diffusive shock measures and free fermion systems .",
