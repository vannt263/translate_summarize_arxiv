    "the @xmath0 meson obtains its mass from the axial anomaly in qcd .",
    "the origin of this mass is not just the local form of the anomaly , but also non - perturbative effects coming from instantons .",
    "the qcd @xmath1-angle also originates from non - perturbative instantons effects .",
    "its source is the multiple connectivity of the configuration space in qcd @xcite and does not require the presence of spin @xmath4 fields and the attendant axial anomaly .",
    "but there is all the same a deep relation between axial anomaly and qcd @xmath1 .",
    "the peccei - quinn @xcite mechanism , basic to discussions of the ckm matrix @xcite , is an example of this connection .    earlier work by rosenzweig _",
    "@xcite , aurilia _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and others @xcite , developing the theory of t hooft @xcite , has formulated the effective lagrangian for @xmath0 in the presence of instantons . in this and subsequent papers",
    ", we reexamine this model from the canonical point of view .",
    "the analysis involves important new considerations on the test function spaces of first class constraints which have not been treated in the literature .",
    "in particular , the qcd @xmath1-states constructed using an analogue of the chern - simons term is  gauge invariant \" or is annihilated by a gauss law constraint only after the proper choice of the test function space for constraints is identified .",
    "our research was motivated by an attempt to revisit the calculation of electric dipole moment ( edm ) from the effective lagrangian approach and to test whether the use of mixed states @xcite restores @xmath2 and @xmath3 invariance , so that the edm becomes zero . as a prelude to this calculation , to be reported in a following paper @xcite , here we formulate the chiral invariant coupling of @xmath0 to nucleons or quarks which is sensitive to the qcd @xmath1 .",
    "it improves upon the standard treatment of this coupling .",
    "the fermion mass term is affected if @xmath5 .",
    "we will show in a coming paper that it induces edm @xcite .",
    "we have however pointed out earlier @xcite that the use of mixed states makes the expectation value of edm zero .    in section",
    "ii , we recall the effective lagrangian for @xmath0 and the demonstration that @xmath0 has mass because of the axial anomaly . in section iii",
    ", we develop the hamiltonian formalism and constraint analysis with particular attention to boundary conditions on test functions .",
    "the qcd @xmath1-states are then formulated after making essential use of the properties of test function spaces .",
    "they are  gauge invariant \" and hence are annihilated by the gauss law constraints . in section iv , we present a brief , but not quite obvious , demonstration , that the hamiltonian approach also displays a mass gap and describes a massive @xmath0 . in section v , we formulate the chirally invariant couplings of quarks and nucleons to the chiral multiplet containing @xmath0 as well .",
    "we also show that the fermion mass term has a @xmath6 dependent @xmath2 and @xmath3 violating piece .",
    "it modifies the fermion propagator .",
    "the latter will be the basis of the electric dipole moment calculation in a following paper .",
    "the target space for the chiral model of @xmath7 flavors is the group manifold of @xmath8 .",
    "the chiral group @xmath9 acts on @xmath8 according to the following rule : @xmath10 for @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the action of the axial vector group @xmath14 instead is @xmath15      the topology of the target manifold @xmath8 is important for us .",
    "we have that @xmath16 that is , @xmath8 is not @xmath17 .    in practice what this means is the following : if @xmath18 describes a flavor multiplet which has pions , and @xmath19 describes the @xmath0 field , then @xmath20 so that the lagrangian or hamiltonian should be invariant under the substitutions @xmath21 or @xmath22    the above simple remark plays a crucial role in what follows .",
    "we next focus on the lagrangian density @xmath23 describing just @xmath0 .",
    "it is invariant under eqs .",

    "the field @xmath27 is dual to the @xmath28-form @xmath29 used in the literature : @xmath30 notation is simplified by using @xmath31 instead of its dual .",
    "here we recall the calculation showing that eq .",
    "( [ lagran - eta - prime-1 ] ) describes a massive field .",
    "we obtain from the variations of the action @xmath32 , @xmath33 so , @xmath34 therefore @xmath35 is a field of mass @xmath36 . let us assume that @xmath37 , if necessary by changing @xmath27 to @xmath38 , so that the mass is just @xmath39 .",
    "we define the momentum fields conjugate to @xmath0 and @xmath27 by @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively . then from @xmath23",

    "( [ field - transf-1 ] ) unless @xmath51 that is , this boundary term vanishes at infinity .",
    "we now argue that this is precisely what we need to make this term a constraint .    on quantization ,",
    "classical fields become quantum fields which are operator - valued _ distributions_. but derivatives of distributions have to be understood and expressed in terms of their test functions which make up their dual space . thus if @xmath52 are test functions for the constraints eq .",
    "( [ constraint-2 ] ) , we must interpret its quantum version as the equation @xmath53 which constrains the state vectors @xmath54 in the domain of the hamiltonian .",
    "but in the classical limit , eq . ( [ quantum - constraint-2 ] ) must go over to eq .",
    "( [ constraint-2 ] ) .",
    "classically , @xmath55 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so we require that @xmath56 in order that the surface term in eq .",
    "( [ constraint - condition-2 ] ) vanishes .    when @xmath52 fulfills eq .",
    "( [ constraint - condition-3 ] ) , we denote the constraint in eq .",
    "( [ quantum - constraint-2 ] ) as @xmath57 , where @xmath58 stands for  gauss law \" : @xmath59    we now see that eq .",
    "( [ gauss - law - in - hamilt-1 ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ constraint - condition-1 ] ) is the gauss law constraint @xmath60 .",
    "we can also consider @xmath61 where @xmath62 may not necessarily fulfill eq .",
    "( [ constraint - condition-3 ] ) . then @xmath63 define the ",
    "charges \" or superselection sectors of the theory @xcite .    since @xmath64",
    ", the action of @xmath63 on @xmath54 depends only on the asymptotic value of @xmath65 .    the constraint eq .",
    "( [ constraint-1 ] ) involves no derivative of fields and requires less careful treatment . in quantum theory",
    "the constraint it generates can be taken to be @xmath66 where @xmath67 are schwartz functions .    the analogue of eq .",
    "( [ quantum - constraint-2 ] ) is @xmath68    the two ( quantum ) constraints are compatible since @xmath69 |\\cdot\\rangle=0.\\ ] ]    now , there is a problem with @xmath63 : it is not invariant under the transformations eq .",
    "( [ field - transf-1 ] ) .",
    "this problem can be dealt with by imposing the quantization condition @xmath70 and working always either with @xmath71 or with @xmath72 .    in later considerations ,",
    "we prefer to use eq .",
    "( [ field - transf - ind - by - charge-1 ] ) .",
    "hereafter , we choose @xmath73 in eq .",
    "( [ quantization - condition-1 ] ) .",
    "observables in quantum theory must commute with @xmath57 and @xmath74 .",
    "more generally , they must preserve the domain of the hamiltonian .",
    "that requires their commutators with @xmath57 and @xmath74 to be zero .",
    "here are some examples of observables :    * since @xmath75 = \\left [ p_i(x ) ,   \\left(\\pi-\\lambda b^0 \\right)(y)\\right ] = 0              \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at equal times , @xmath76 is an observable .",

    "( [ constraint - condition-3 ] ) .",
    "but @xmath79 3 .",
    "we should in principle smear the fields in the list ( a ) to ( g ) with appropriate test functions , say schwartz functions",
    ". then the algebra of observables is generated by these smeared fields .",
    "let @xmath80 denote a quantum state for @xmath81 , or rather @xmath82 .",
    "then the qcd @xmath1-state is @xmath83 with @xmath84 this state is gauge invariant .",
    "furthermore , the operator @xmath85 commutes with @xmath86 if @xmath87 : @xmath88 that provides support to the @xmath89-periodicity of qcd @xmath1-states .    the qcd analogue of @xmath86 is a winding number @xmath90 gauge transformation .",
    "but @xmath91 does not leave the observable @xmath92 invariant and that requires explanation .",
    "that is the following .",
    "let us consider the vacuum expectation value @xmath93 of @xmath94 : @xmath95 then @xmath96 is invariant when @xmath94 is conjugated by @xmath85 .",
    "so we can focus attention to @xmath97 .",
    "now , if we represent @xmath91 by the function @xmath98 on a circle , then @xmath97 acts on @xmath98 as its momentum by eq .",
    "so @xmath99 describe a circle @xmath100 and its momentum .",
    "a well - known consequence of this interpretation is that the spectrum @xmath101 of momentum for the @xmath1-states is @xmath102 , that is , for the vectors @xmath103 , @xmath104 thus there is a spectral flow as @xmath1 changes by @xmath89 , with @xmath105 in this sense , the theory has a @xmath89-period in @xmath1 : @xmath93 is not invariant under conjugation by @xmath91 , but its spectrum is .",
    "but @xmath85 shifts the vacuum expectation value of the quantum field @xmath92 and is thus spontaneously broken for generic values of @xmath1 . for the circle problem , this is reflected in the fact that it shifts the domain of momentum @xcite .",
    "we want to show that the hamiltonian @xmath106 in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian - eta-2 ] ) describes a field with mass @xmath39 .",
    "first note that finiteness of energy requires that @xmath107 which implies that @xmath108 hence , it is like a @xmath109 or @xmath52 discussed previously .    for this reason we can write @xmath110    since eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian - eta-2 ] ) also requires that @xmath111 we further require that @xmath112 hence @xmath113    so we can once more substitute for @xmath114 in eq .",

    "( [ field - transf-1],[field - transf-2 ] ) is the @xmath119 matrix of fields @xmath120 of eq .",
    "( [ u - field-1 ] ) .",
    "we now have in addition the field @xmath121 listed in section iii.b .",
    "the lagrangian involving just goldstone bosons can be written in the usual way in terms of @xmath122 @xcite .",
    "our focus here is the coupling of the goldstone modes to fermions . in particular , we are interested on the fermion mass modification due to @xmath123 .",
    "we note that @xmath86 is the operator implementing the winding number @xmath90 gauge transformations .",
    "it carries no energy and momentum and @xmath86 is invariant under spatial translations .",
    "] and can have a tadpole - like effect on feynman diagrams .",
    "since @xmath2 or @xmath3 reverses @xmath86 , that is , @xmath124 such tadpoles can induce electric dipole moment , or more generally flavor - diagonal @xmath2 and @xmath3 violations .",
    "our model for electric dipole moment is based on this idea .    the left- and right - quark fields @xmath125 and @xmath126 are @xmath7-dimensional multiplets transforming by @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "their standard coupling @xmath129 to @xmath122 can now be generalized in a chirally invariant manner as follows : @xmath130    in the @xmath1-vacuum @xmath131 of chiral fields , @xmath122 has the value @xmath90 and @xmath86 has the value @xmath132 .",
    "thus in this vector state , @xmath133 has the expectation value @xmath134    for @xmath81 ( @xmath135 ) , @xmath136 is the standard @xmath2 and @xmath3 invariant mass term @xmath137 with @xmath138 ( @xmath139 ) .    but for @xmath140 , the mass term violates @xmath2 and @xmath3 : @xmath141 we can regard @xmath142 as the new mass scale in the model .",
    "it can not be determined using just the effective lagrangian approach .",
    "thus edm measurements can detect only @xmath143 as ( [ new - mass - lagrangian-1 ] ) shows .",
    "presumably @xmath142 is of the order of the qcd scale @xmath144 .",
    "with such a value of @xmath142 , one can also estimate @xmath145 from experimental bounds on edm .",
    "we do such estimates in a later paper @xcite .",
    "the vacuum value of @xmath122 is @xmath146 .",
    "any transformation which shifts it is spontaneously broken .",
    "one such transformation is the axial @xmath14 which changes @xmath147 to @xmath148 and shifts @xmath0 by @xmath149 .",
    "it is not a symmetry and can not be used to eliminate the @xmath2 and @xmath3 violating term in eq .",
    "( [ new - mass - lagrangian-1 ] ) . in a future calculation",

    "we can also consider mass - like terms of the baryons . for two flavors , eq .",
    "( [ mass - lagrangian-1 ] ) is replaced by @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the nucleon field . that gives @xmath152    the fermion propagators are thus affected by @xmath145 . if , in the case of quarks , @xmath153 then eq .
