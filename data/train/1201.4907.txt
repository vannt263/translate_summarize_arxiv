    "during the past two decades , great achievements have been obtained in the understanding of the geometry and topology of symplectic manifolds . among them",
    "are the fukaya category of symplectic manifolds , originated by fukaya ( @xcite ) , and the symplectic field theory ( sft ) , introduced by eliashberg - givental - hofer ( @xcite ) . in this paper , we study the cyclic homology of the fukaya category of an exact symplectic manifold with contact type boundary and its relations to the linearized contact homology defined in sft .",
    "the main motivation of our study is kontsevich and costello s work on topological conformal field theories ( @xcite and @xcite ) , and the work of cieliebak - latschev ( @xcite ) , which studies the algebraic structures on the linearized contact homology and their relations with string topology .",
    "let us explain in more detail .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    in @xcite kontsevich associates to an a@xmath2 algebra with a cyclically invariant inner product a cohomology class on the compactified moduli spaces of marked riemann surfaces , and from this as well as some analogous examples he first raised his theory of noncommutative symplectic geometries .",
    "such an a@xmath2 algebra was later called by him a _ calabi - yau a@xmath2 algebra _ , and was systematically studied in his work with soibelman ( @xcite ) . in his talk at the hodge centennial conference ( @xcite ) he showed that a calabi - yau a@xmath2 algebra , or more generally , a calabi - yau a@xmath2 algebra `` with several objects '' , _",
    "i.e. _ a calabi - yau a@xmath2 category , is an _",
    "open _ topological conformal field theory ( tcft ) , and its hochschild cohomology is in fact a _ closed _ topological conformal field theory . as a particular example , he conjectured that the fukaya category of a symplectic manifold is a calabi - yau category .",
    "similar restults have been obtained by costello in @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to getzler @xcite and costello @xcite for more details and interesting results about tcft s .",
    "inspired by @xcite and string topology ( @xcite ) , the first author showed that the cyclic cohomology of a calabi - yau a@xmath2 category endows the structure of an involutive lie bialgebra ( @xcite ) .",
    "while the existence of the cyclically invariant inner product on the fukaya category is still under verification ( for some partial results see @xcite ) , the work of kontsevich and costello remains a guiding philosophy for our study .",
    "our first theorem in the following says that the lie bialgebra exists on the cyclic cohomology of the fukaya category ( no non - degenerate pairing is assumed ) :    [ theorema ] let @xmath0 be an exact symplectic manifold with contact type boundary such that @xmath1 .",
    "then the cyclic cohomology of fukaya category @xmath3 of @xmath0 has the structure of an involutive lie bialgebra .",
    "the key point in the above theorem is that , in the construction of the fukaya category , counting the pseudo - holomorphic disks is _ a priori _ cyclically invariant .",
    "let @xmath0 be as in theorem [ theorema ] .",
    "denote its boundary by @xmath4 .",
    "the symplectic field theory of eliashberg - givental - hofer relates the geometry of closed reeb orbits on @xmath4 with the geometry of pseudo - holomorphic curves on the symplectic completion @xmath5 of @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , pseudo - holomorphic curves in @xmath5 asymptotic to closed reeb orbits share a lot of properties of a closed tcft ; for more details , see @xcite . among all the interesting properties of sft , cieliebak - latschev ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem a ) ) proved that the _ linearized contact homology _ of @xmath0 , denoted by @xmath6 , which basically arises from counting the pseudo - holomorphic cyclinders in @xmath5 , is in fact a lie bialgebra . with the guiding philosophy of kontsevich and costello that the cyclic cohomology of the fukaya category of @xmath0 is a closed tcft ( and in fact , this closed tcft is universal in the sense that any other closed tcft will factor through it ) , one might wonder whether there is a direct relationship between them .",
    "the following theorem gives an affirmative answer to this question , which is also inspired by a theorem of cieliebak - latschev in the same article ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem b ) ) and by seidel @xcite , and may be viewed as a realization of the holographic principle ( or in some other words , the bulk - boundary correspondence ) in physics :    [ mapfromcont ] let @xmath0 be an exact symplectic manifold with contact type boundary such that @xmath1 .",
    "there is a chain map from the linearized contact complex @xmath7 to the cyclic cochain complex @xmath8 of @xmath9 : @xmath10 which induces a lie bialgebra homomorphism on their homology .",
    "the homomorphism in the above theorem is similar to the one given in @xcite , which is given by counting the pseudo - holomorphic cylinders with one end approaching a closed reeb orbit and the other end lying in several lagrangian submanifolds .",
    "we remark that the study of pseudo - holomorphic curves with some boundary components approaching the closed reeb orbits and some other lying in lagrangian submanifolds ( each boundary component lying exactly in _ one _ lagrangian submanifold ) has already been discussed in @xcite . in the case of pseudo - holomorphic cylinders ,",
    "cieliebak - latschev first showed that they in fact induce a homomorphism of lie bialgebras from the linearized contact homology to the @xmath11-equivariant homology of the free loop space of the lagrangian submanifold being considered .",
    "however , it is hard to see that the homomorphism they discovered is _ on the chain level_.    we remark that , in fact , on the chain level the homomorphism in theorem  [ mapfromcont ] is a _ lie@xmath2 homomorphism _ ( or more generally , a _",
    "bv@xmath2 homomorphism _ in the sense of cieliebak - latschev ) .",
    "more details can be found in  [ sect_rel ] .",
    "the key point of theorem  [ mapfromcont ] is that , when considering several lagrangian submanifolds together , _",
    "i.e. _ the fukaya category , we do get a homomorphism on the chain level from the linearized contact chain complex to the cyclic cochain complex of the fukaya category .",
    "this idea seems to have first appeared in seidel @xcite , where he considered a version of pseudo - holomorphic cylinders , with one boundary component being a hamiltonian closed orbit and the other lying on several lagrangian submanifolds .",
    "seidel s homomorphism is from the symplectic homology to the hochschild cohomology of the fukaya category .",
    "our construction may be viewed as a cyclic version of his . on the other hand , from the work of bourgeois - oancea ( @xcite ) there is a deep relationship between the symplectic homology and the linearized contact homology ; in fact , there is a long exact sequence which relates them . as is probably well - known from cyclic homology theory and non - commutative geometry , there is also a long exact sequence , called the connes exact sequence , connecting the hochschild homology and cyclic homology , too .",
    "in fact , jones showed in @xcite that for a simply connected manifold , the hochschild homology ( resp . the cyclic homology ) of its de rham complex is isomorphic to the cohomology ( resp .",
    "the @xmath11-equivariant cohomology ) of its free loop space .",
    "such a theorem is also implicit ( or almost explicit , as we would say ) in the work of k .-",
    "chen @xcite , and a good reference for it is getzler - jones - petrack @xcite .",
    "all these results in fact fit into a package , called _ string topology _ , initiated by chas - sullivan ( @xcite ) . roughly speaking , string topology is a study of the topological structures on the free loop space of compact manifolds .",
    "chas - sullivan proved in @xcite that the @xmath11-equivariant homology of the free loop space of a compact manifold relative to the constant loops has the structure of a lie bialgebra .",
    "such a lie bialgebra , as shown by cieliebak - latschev ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem c ) ) , is isomorphic to the linearized contact homology of the cotangent bundle of the manifold .      besides the articles that we have cited above , there are several other works that are related to the interest of this paper .",
    "first , we have benefited a lot from the paper of abbondandolo - schwarz @xcite , which gives a complete treatment of the isomorphism between the floer / symplectic homology of cotangent bundles and the loop product defined in string topology by chas - sullivan in @xcite .",
    "we are also inspired by the work of bourgeois - oancea @xcite .",
    "as we have said above , they have shown that there is a long exact sequence @xmath12&\\mathrm{sh}_*(m)\\ar[r]&\\mathrm{ch}_*^{\\mathrm{lin}}(m)\\ar[r ] & \\mathrm{ch}_{*-2}^{\\mathrm{lin}}(m)\\ar[r ] & \\mathrm{sh}_{*-1}(m)\\ar[r]&\\cdots } \\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the symplectic homology and @xmath14 is the linearized contact homology , respectively . from the work of seidel @xcite and our above theorem",
    ", there should be the following morphism of long exact sequences @xmath15&\\mathrm{sh}_*(m)\\ar[r]\\ar[d]&\\mathrm{ch}_*^{\\mathrm{lin}}(m)\\ar[r]\\ar[d ] & \\mathrm{ch}_{*-2}^{\\mathrm{lin}}(m)\\ar[r]\\ar[d ] & \\mathrm{sh}_{*-1}(m)\\ar[r]\\ar[d]&\\cdots\\\\ \\ar[r]&\\mathrm{hh}^*({\\mathcal fuk}(m))\\ar[r ] & \\mathrm{hc}^*({\\mathcal fuk}(m))\\ar[r ] & \\mathrm{hc}^{*-2}({\\mathcal fuk}(m))\\ar[r ] & \\mathrm{hh}^{*-1}({\\mathcal fuk}(m))\\ar[r]&\\cdots } \\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the hochschild cohomology with values in a ground field of characteristic zero and @xmath17 is the cyclic cohomology , respectively , and the long exact in the bottom line is the connes exact sequence for a@xmath2 categories .",
    "so far we have mentioned in this paper several homology theories : symplectic homology , linearized contact homology , hochschild cohomology , cyclic cohomology , @xmath18 , and various homomorphisms among them .",
    "these homomorphisms are usually given by counting the pseudo - holomorphic cylinders in each situation being considered .",
    "we list the types of pseudo - holomorphic cylinders that are studied by different authors in literature , which may help the reader to get some more idea on these constructions .",
    "[ figures ]    also , after the first draft was posted on arxiv , we are informed by eliashberg that he , bourgeois and ekholm have obtained some results analogous to ours ( @xcite ) . in these two papers",
    "they study a variety of algebraic structures ( including lie bialgebra ) on the legendrian homology , and relate them to symplectic homology ( the pictures are similar to above ) .",
    "we are grateful to him for acknowledging us about their work .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    the rest of the paper is devoted to the proof of the above theorems .",
    "it is organized as follows : in  2 , we first collect some facts on the fukaya category of exact symplectic manifolds , and then prove theorem [ theorema ] in  [ sect_liebialg ] . in  [ sect_lin ] we recall the definition and some properties of linearized contact homology . in  [ sect_ana ] we set up the necessary analytic machinery for the moduli space of pseudo - holomorphic curves to be considered later . in  [ sect_rel ] we prove theorem [ mapfromcont ] . in  [ sect_cot ] , we study the example of cotangent bundles and relate it with string topology .
