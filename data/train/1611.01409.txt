    "in the innermost parts of galaxy disks , ranging between 1 and 3 disk exponential length - scales , according to the galaxy luminosity @xcite , the luminous matter dominates the kinematics : light traces the mass @xcite . instead in the outer skirts , far from galaxy centers , rotational velocities are found to be constant or even rising with radius despite the faint stellar or gaseous surface brightness .",
    "this contradicts the well known keplerian - like expectations of the standard newtonian gravity if light traces the mass .",
    "it is well known that , in order to explain this anomaly , a dark matter ( hereafter dm ) halo is routinely added in the computation of the gravitational potential @xcite .",
    "the luminous and dark matter contribution to the rotation curve ( hereafter rc ) can explain the observed velocities as traced by star light or gas emission , even at large galactocentric distances where rotational velocities are flat or increase with radius .",
    "on the other hand , it is well known that collisionless and stable weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) in a @xmath1cdm ( cold dark matter ) cosmology , provide a major scenario to frame the dm in galaxies and in the universe .",
    "cosmological simulations show that the dm density distribution @xmath3 is nearly universal , i.e. dependent only on the mass of the halo .",
    "this density profile have a characteristic steep slope in the inner galactic regions which can be approximated by the power - law @xmath4 , with @xmath5 a characteristic constant density and @xmath6 the constant scaling radius .",
    "this cuspy density profile does not show up in a number of dwarfs , spirals and lsb galaxies @xcite in favor of a much shallower cored profile .",
    "however , because the inner regions of galaxies are dominated by the luminous matter and most of the dm halo extends well outside the ( rotating ) stellar disk , the dm density profile is accurately derived only in a very small fraction of objects and most of the evidence for a cored distribution comes from stacked rcs .",
    "in this situation , the evidence of many stacked solid body rcs leading to a solid body profile @xmath7 at @xmath8 maybe not sufficient to determine the nature of dark matter .",
    "one needs , in fact , very accurate and complete mass models also of individual kinematics .",
    "this would require to have , for the same galaxy , an inner rc , usually traced by mm or optical lines , and a very extended rc traced by 21 cm emission .",
    "for the debated issue about a core or cusp dark matter profile i we must report the recent results of numerical simulations : baryonic feedback occurring at a later times than galaxy formation period can transform the original nfw profiles into cored ones @xcite .",
    "hence , the evidence of cores for dm halo density distributions in dwarf galaxies is not sufficient to disprove the @xmath1cdm scenario .",
    "the cusp - core issue in galaxy dm density profiles , also related to the investigation of the nature of dm itself , require the investigateion of galaxies of different hubble type , luminosity and morphology .    in this paper",
    "we study in detail the dm distribution in the spiral galaxy m33 .",
    "this object gives us the possibility of accurately deriving the dm halo distribution out to large distances and therefore to uniquely test the @xmath1cdm cosmological scenario .",
    "this spiral hosts no bulge nor a prominent bar @xcite : the absence of these concentrated stellar distributions much alleviates the usual uncertainty in deconvolving the disk contribution from that of a bulge , and of modelling correctly non circular motion .",
    "m33 is a low - luminosity spiral galaxy rich in gas and very much dark matter dominated : both properties make easy to track its dark component .",
    "its rotation curve is very extended due to the presence of a large gaseous disc and has an excellent spatial resolution due to its proximity and to the presence of co - lines that trace the inner kinematics @xcite .",
    "it is important to stress the crucial result obtained for this object by @xcite .",
    "they have inferred the stellar mass surface density as function of the galactocentric radius by means of the measured pixel - sed ( spectral energy distribution ) and proper population synthesis models .",
    "this provides a good estimate of the stellar mass distribution in the m33 , in particular of its radial profile , which previously has been assumed proportional to the luminosity one .",
    "this reduces considerably the uncertainties on the contribution of luminous matter to the galaxy circular velocity @xcite .",
    "the gaseous disk mass contribution can be obtained directly from the hi surface photometry given the well known distance of the galaxy .",
    "in @xcite the dm density was derived using the detailed maps of the stellar surface - density in connection with a standard fit ( via @xmath9 minimization ) of the total rc .",
    "the mass model considered , includes a stellar plus a gaseous disk , and a dark halo mass .",
    "the latter is assumed with a nfw or alternatively , with a urc - halo radial density profile , both with two free parameters to fit .",
    "their results indicate that both models give a satisfactory fit , even though the fit using the nfw profile for dark matter is slightly better .",
    "the dm halo density profile can not be uniquely determined : the main reason being that the luminous matter still significantly contributes to the total gravitational potential in the inner parts of the galaxy . only for spirals or dwarfs with maximum velocities",
    "@xmath10 kms@xmath11 the rc directly measures the dm profile . in objects like m33 , instead",
    ", even the small uncertainties left in modelling the stellar disk mass , propagate into the inferred dm halo profile and can move the values of the best fit model from the cored to the cuspy side .    to constrain the dm density distribution in normal galaxies one can use a second scheme in which",
    "the kinematics is very weakly correlated with the ( somewhat uncertain ) distribution of luminous matter @xcite .",
    "this method , discussed in @xcite , was applied first to the milky way and then to the spiral galaxy ngc 3198 @xcite . in short words",
    ", it allows to derive very precisely the dm density in the outskirt of a galaxy when the circular velocity is well known up to its first derivative , so that @xmath12 @xmath13 and the hi surface density is observed .",
    "the paper is organized in four sections . in sec .",
    "we present the three main luminous matter components of the galactic disk , with their corresponding surface mass densities , and it is devoted to summarize the observed rotation curve and the baryonic disk contribution to it .",
    "we also summarize the main results of the previous dynamical analysis @xcite . in sec .",
    "we develop a local modelling technique that does not rely on any of the previously global mass modeling of the galaxy to obtain a very robust and careful determination of the dm halo density of m33 , and finally , sec .",
    "summarizes the main conclusions of this work .",
    "in this section we summarize the structural properties of the stellar and gaseous components of the galactic disk of m33 and we discuss its surface mass density radial - dependence as derived by @xcite , used to fit the rc of m33 .      thanks to the tight correlations between the color and the apparent stellar mass - to - light ratio @xmath14 @xcite , the stellar mass , to a first approximation , can be determined using multi - band optical imaging measurements of the whole galaxy luminosity . however , due to likely radial variations of the stellar mass - to - light ratio , as galaxy disks grow with time , @xcite have been using chemo - photometric models for a large samples of spatially resolved , disk - dominated galaxies .",
    "a radially decreasing mass - to - light ratio was found based on galaxy color gradients and spectral synthesis techniques .",
    "being m33 the second closest spiral , @xcite , implemented an extension of the zcr09 method to obtain a detailed map of the stellar surface mass density using mosaic maps in the @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 bands from the local group survey @xcite and from the sloan digital sky survey @xcite .",
    "after processed the images , a pixel - by - pixel synthesis model of the stellar population was performed , to obtain the stellar mass map of the m33 disk out to 5  kpc .",
    "this showed a clear radial gradient of the mass - to - light ratio in the inner regions , consistent with the negative radial metallicity gradient which supports an inside - out formation scenario .",
    "this results underlines the importance of carrying out a careful analysis of the stellar mass distribution in disks before computing their contribution to rotation curves @xcite . by fitting the resulting radial averages of the stellar surface mass density of m33 , with analytic functions , namely exponential functions with with different scale - lengths @xmath20 ,",
    "@xcite obtain the following approximation for the radial distribution of the stellar mass surface density @xmath21 in units of @xmath22pc@xmath23 : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the radial coordinate given in kpc .",
    "the fits to the radial distribution of the stellar mass density are shown in fig .",
    ", where we can notice the drop of the stellar mass density by more than 3 orders of magnitudes from the center to the outskirts of the m33 disk .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath21 is uncertain by a @xmath26 while its radial trend has negligible uncertainties . as in @xcite , in order to compute the dynamical contribution of the stellar mass density to the rotation curve , we consider the stellar disk perpendicular to the galactic plane as a flaring disk with a radially varying half thickness of only 100  pc at the center but as high as 1  kpc at the outer disk edge .",
    "the gaseous disk is made of atomic and molecular gas ( hydrogen and helium ) .",
    "the high resolution 21-cm data of m33 for the atomic hydrogen gas , the relative best fitting tilted ring model , and the radial averages of the hi surface density distribution , @xmath27 have been presented by @xcite . for the dynamical contribution of the gaseous disk to the rotation curve",
    ", the gaseous disk has been considered vertically thick with half thickness of @xmath28  kpc .        as regard the baryonic matter , the chemo - photometric method provides a quite accurate determination of the stellar surface density , we can realize and then use the fact that , in the innermost parts of the galaxy ( @xmath29 kpc ) , see fig .",
    ", it dominates over the gaseous surface density .",
    "moreover , in the approximate range : 7 kpc @xmath30 10 kpc , stars and the atomic gas have a similar mass surface density and beyond 10 kpc , they decrease with the radius in a similar way .",
    "it is useful to recall how in @xcite these derived mass distributions were used for the standard rc fitting method .",
    "the stellar and gaseous disk contributions add in quadrature to fit the rc as follows : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the ratio between the stellar disk mass and that given by eq .",
    ", which is 4.9@xmath33  m@xmath34 out to @xmath35  kpc .",
    "the parameter @xmath36 takes into account the uncertainties in the derivation of the stellar disk mass and hence , the total stellar disk mass is allowed to vary in the interval @xmath37",
    "the terms @xmath39 and @xmath40 indicate the contributions to the rotation curve of the stellar disk , as given by of eq . , and of the helium corrected hi and h@xmath41 gas mass @xcite .",
    "the dynamical analysis of the rotation curve is done by modelling the galaxy with a dm halo and a stellar and gaseous disks with the surface densities as discussed above in the radial range : @xmath42 kpc , b. two different dm halo models were considered by @xcite . the dm nfw density profile for structures growing in a @xmath1cdm hierarchical universe @xcite given by : @xmath43 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the two usual halo parameters .",
    "the contribution of the dm density profile adds in quadrature to the disk contribution to give the total rotational velocity as @xmath44    the virial mass @xmath45 and the concentration parameter @xmath46 are related to @xmath5 and @xmath6 by : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the virial radius and @xmath49 g@xmath50 is the critical density of the universe .",
    "the free parameters , @xmath51 and @xmath45 were determined as independent parameters , but after the rc fit , the authors checked the consistency of their values with the relations obtained by numerical simulations of structure formation in a @xmath1cdm universe .",
    "the free parameters of this halo model : @xmath45 and @xmath52 are in fact not independent from each other @xcite .",
    "recent simulations @xcite suggest a correlation relation , expressed using the dimensionless value of hubble parameter @xmath53 @xcite as : @xmath54    @xcite obtained : @xmath55 @xmath56 and @xmath57 m@xmath58 by considering a composite probability , which takes into account the fit to the rc , the synthesis models of the stellar population and the @xmath59m@xmath60 relation found by numerical simulations .",
    "the second halo profile we consider is the phenomenological cored density distribution , that successfully fits individual rcs ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) , as well as the universal rotation curve of spirals .",
    "this cored halo profile , also known as the burkert halo profile @xcite has a radial density distribution igiven by @xmath61 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the central density and the core radius respectively .",
    "this density profile induces a gravitational potential such that every particles in the galactic disk totates with a velocity @xmath62 which adds in quadrature to the barionic disk component : @xmath63    the central core density @xmath5 and the scaling radius @xmath6 are not independent , as it was shown in @xcite : @xmath64    @xcite performed the dynamical analysis of the m33 rc with the aid of the stellar mass distribution given by the bvi maps and found the best fitting values of the parameters as : @xmath65 kpc , @xmath66 m@xmath58 kpc@xmath67 and @xmath68 m@xmath69 with an acceptable global @xmath70 although larger than the best fit @xmath70 values for a nfw dm profilel . therefore , even for this galaxy , despite we have accurate extended data concerning the whole gravitational potential as well as a good determination of the mass associated to the luminous components , both dm mass models are acceptable and the best fit solution is quite degenerate .",
    "this can be easily attributed to the fact that in m33 , even beyond @xmath71 kpc , the influence of the luminous matter is not negligible so that any derivation of the dm density profile would be fraught with the uncertainties inherent to such a component .",
    "more precisely , since in the inner regions @xmath72 ( being @xmath73 the disk length scale ) of most spirals , the stellar disk dominates over the dark component , even small uncertainties in the mass determination of the former induces large uncertainties in the values of the structural parameters of the dark components . by using a second method for fitting the rc data in the next section we hope to alleviate this degenacy .",
    "we will see that the fit related to the second method is less dependent on the luminous matter distribution and thus hopefully it will help us to clarify better the properties of the dm halo that hosts m33 .",
    "a new method to determine the dm density distribution in spiral galaxies has been introduced by @xcite .",
    "this method was applied first to estimate the value of the dm density at the sun s location @xcite , and extended in @xcite to the study of the dm distribution in the galaxy ngc 3198 .",
    "the goal of this section is to derive , for the spiral galaxy m33 , a model independent dm density using this method which deals with the rc at large radii , where the influences of the stellar and gaseous disks are weak .",
    "the idea , brought by @xcite is to resort the equation of centrifugal equilibrium , which holds the spiral galaxies : @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the radial accelerations , generated by the dm halo , stellar and gaseous disks respectively .    under the approximation of a spherical dm halo",
    ", we have @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a factor correcting the spherical gauss law used above in case of an oblate dm halo and it takes values between 1.05 and 1.00 ( see details in @xcite ) , @xmath79 is the velocity given by the rc , @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the stellar and gas velocities and @xmath36 the usual stellar mass - to - light ratio .",
    "the strength of this method lies in the fact that we have transformed the surface mass density of the stellar and gaseous disks in equivalent bulk densities with the aid of gauss s law .",
    "since the velocities induced by the stellar and gaseous disks decrease slowly after @xmath82 kpc , we expect a sharp fall for their equivalent three - dimensional densities @xmath83 and @xmath84 and we are just left only with the dm contribution to the observed rc . from this fact , we can infer the dm halo properties directly from the experimental data .",
    "an issue left to treat is to derive an analytical expression for the total velocity @xmath79 from the available discreet set of the observational points of the experimental rc .",
    "having an analytic function will avoid artifact due to the numerical computation of the derivative of @xmath79 needed for the computation of the total density as given by eq .. the next subsection is devoted to find an appropriate empirical smooth curve to solve this problem .      with the aid of the local density method , we can study , directly from the experimental data , the dm halo properties by computing the densities given by eq .",
    "and eq . respectively . just with the purpose of deriving a smooth profile of @xmath85 ,",
    "we introduce the following an empirical velocity formula to describe the rotation curve of m33 : @xmath86    this is a simple , rational , 3-parameter - dependent velocity profile that reproduces at large galactocentric distances a flat velocity curve and as we will see immediately , it describes genuinely the rc in the range allowed by the experimental data .",
    "the three free parameters , namely @xmath87 the terminal velocity , @xmath6 the scaling radius and @xmath88 , an additional parameter to prevent @xmath79 to be constant , make the degree of freedom of the fit to be similar to that of the first method ( see previous section ) when considering the uncertainties on the stellar surface mass density . in addition , the empirical velocity formula can be used both for the urc halo plus luminous disk and the nfw halo plus luminous disk mass models .    by minimizing the @xmath9 distribution for fitting the rc data with its measurement errors , with the above analytic function",
    ", we obtain the best fit parameters : @xmath89 km s@xmath90 @xmath91 kpc , and @xmath92 giving a @xmath93 . in fig .",
    "we show the fit to the rc data of the derived analytic function . for comparison",

    "no information can be inferred except by extrapolating the best fitting models , which later can be tested using higher resolution observations . in the radial range",
    "@xmath114 kpc @xmath115 kpc , the stellar component is very relevant with respect to the dm halo component . for both dm halo models tested , the structural parameters of the dm distribution",
    "are mingled with the unknown value of the disk mass . in both cases ,",
    "no information can be extracted either since any measurements of dm distribution would be fraught with the uncertainties due to the stellar contribution ( i.e. the stellar disk accounts for most of the total gravitational potential of the galaxy ) . around @xmath116 kpc ,",
    "the luminous matter still competes against dm to dominate over the total mass given the uncertainties of the circular velocity . but",
    "beyond 9.5  kpc , at @xmath117 the exponential decrese of the stellar matter density and the negligible contribution of the gaseous component , which never plays a role even iif its total mass is about half of that of the stars , assure that only the dm component balances the radial accelerations , which the gaseous disk is engaged with .",
    "in this paper we deepened the results of @xcite which obtained a global fit of the rc of m33 , after an accurate mass modelling of its stellar disk and by considering a dm halo with a cuspy nfw or a cored urc profile .",
    "the results of the global fit to the rc favour a cuspy @xmath1cdm halos despite a cored one is still compatible with the data . in this paper",
    "we have followed a new approach to study the dm content of m33 .",
    "relying on the centrifugal equilibrium condition , assuming a spherical halo , we trace the properties of the dm halo only by the experimental rc .",
    "this method , used also by @xcite and @xcite , relies on fitting the dark matter density distribution of m33 in the radial range @xmath2 where the stellar and gaseous contributions to the rc are negligible . according to this method , the urc profile with the following parameters : @xmath99 kpc and @xmath100 m@xmath58 kpc@xmath67 which corresponds to a halo mass of @xmath118 provides an excellent fit to the m33 rotation curve .",
    "therefore , with the analysis presented in this paper , the possibility that m33 harbors a cored dark matter halo seems still suitable .",
    "even though the determination of the stellar disk mass via synthesis models has eliminated most of the disk - halo degeneracies in this low luminosity spiral , we have shown that the cuspy or cored dark matter density profiles degeneracy still hold because of the possible different methodologies in modelling rc data .",

    "<S> the second method relies on the local equation of centrifugal equilibrium and on the rotation curve slope . in the aforementioned range of distances </S>",
    "<S> , we fit the observed velocity profile using a function which has a rational dependence on the radius . following @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we then derive an expression for the slope of the rotation curve and for the radial dependence of the local dark matter distribution . in the radial range @xmath2 where the uncertainties induced by the luminous matter ( stars and gas ) start to become negligible , we tested the nfw and the urc dark matter profiles . with this second method </S>",
    "<S> we confirm that both profiles are compatible with the data even though in this case the cored burkert mass density profile provides a more reasonable value for the barionic - to dark matter ratio .    </S>",
