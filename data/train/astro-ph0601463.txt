    "in the past few years measurement of the evolution of galaxy luminosity functions at a broad range of wavelengths has rapidly matured .",
    "one consequence of this has been the refinement in our understanding of how the space density of the galaxy star formation rate ( sfr ) evolves @xcite .",
    "in particular the recent results from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , the galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ) , and classifying objects by medium - band observations ( combo17 ) at ultraviolet ( uv ) wavelengths , and from the spitzer space telescope at far - infrared ( fir ) wavelengths , now allows this cosmic star formation history ( sfh ) to be quite tightly constrained ( to within @xmath6 ) up to redshifts of @xmath7 .",
    "combined with measurements of the sfh at higher redshifts from fir , sub - millimeter , balmer line and uv emission , the sfh is reasonably well determined ( within a factor of about 3 at @xmath8 ) up to @xmath9 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "additional results from the super - kamiokande ( sk ) particle detector provide a strong limit on the electron antineutrino ( @xmath3 ) flux , 1.2@xmath10s@xmath11 ( for @xmath12mev ) , originating from supernova type  ii ( snii ; here and throughout , we assume the inclusion of all core - collapse supernovae : types ii , ib , and ic ) events associated with the sfh @xcite .",
    "this limit on the diffuse supernova neutrino background ( dsnb ) acts to constrain the normalisation of the sfh @xcite .",
    "an exploration of quantities predicted from the sfh , the stellar and metal mass density evolution , and supernova ( sn ) rate evolution , provides further insight into the allowable normalisation of the sfh @xcite .",
    "this series of interconnected physical properties of galaxies and sne provides an emerging opportunity for determining the level of the sfh normalisation , and the sfh measurements particularly for @xmath4 now have the precision to allow this exploration of their accuracy .",
    "constraining the normalisation of the sfh will support a range of quantitative analyses of galaxy evolution , including the mass - dependence of the sfh ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the reasons underlying the decline in the sfh to low redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the sequence of assumptions explored here starts from observed luminosity density measurements .",
    "( 1 )  to these , dust corrections ( where necessary ) , sfr calibrations and imf assumptions are applied , to produce corrected sfh measurements .",
    "( 2 )  from the sfh , assumptions about the high - mass imf fraction that produce snii lead to predictions for the snii rate density . this can be compared directly with measurements of this quantity .",
    "( 3 )  assumptions about the neutrino emission per snii then give a prediction of the dsnb , for comparison with the sk limit .",
    "since optical snii can be hidden from observations by dust obscuration , the present snii rate density measurements may merely be lower limits .",
    "in contrast , since neutrinos are unaffected by dust , the dsnb provides an absolute upper limit on the true snii rate .",
    "the consistency that we find between the sfh data and the sk upper limit on the dsnb indicates that there is little room to increase the overall normalisation of the sfh .",
    "thus , this constrains each of the dust corrections , the assumed imf , and the neutrino emission per supernova .",
    "none can be increased significantly without requiring at least one of the others to be reduced below its expected range .",
    "below , we focus especially on the assumed imf , noting the more detailed treatment of the neutrino emission per supernova by @xcite .",
    "a parallel set of assumptions to step ( 2 ) regarding the generation of snia lead to predictions for the snia rate density , and this is explored in some detail with tantalising implications regarding the extent of the snia delay time .",
    "in  [ data ] we update the sfh data compilation of @xcite and address some of the assumptions that affect the normalisation .",
    "we identify the best parametric fit to the most robust subset of this data in  [ fits ] , consistent with the @xmath3 limits from sk . in  [ results ] we present the results of this fitting in terms of the stellar and metal mass density evolution and the snii and snia rate evolution .",
    "the implications for the assumed imf and snia properties are discussed further in ",

    "the compilation of @xcite was taken as the starting point for this analysis , shown in figure  [ fig : sfh ] as grey points .",
    "these data are reproduced from figure  1 of @xcite , and use their  common \" obscuration correction where necessary .",
    "additional measurements are indicated in colour in figure  [ fig : sfh ] . for @xmath16 these consist of fir",
    "( @xmath17 m ) photometry from the spitzer space telescope @xcite , and uv measurements from the sdss @xcite , galex @xcite and the combo17 project @xcite . at @xmath18 a new radio ( 1.4ghz )",
    "measurement is shown @xcite , which is highly consistent with the fir results , as expected from the radio - fir correlation @xcite . also at low redshift",
    "( @xmath19 is a new h@xmath20 derived measurement @xcite . at higher redshifts",
    "additional sfh measurements come from the hubble ultra deep field ( udf , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and from various photometric dropout analyses , probing rest - frame uv luminosities @xcite .",
    "the udf measurements of @xcite are derived through fitting spectral energy distributions to the udf photometry using a variety of templates with a range of underlying assumptions .",
    "in particular this includes different imf assumptions for different templates .",
    "although we show these measurements in figure  [ fig : sfh ] for illustrative purposes ( having scaled them assuming they were uniformly estimated using a @xcite @xcite imf ) , we do not include them in subsequent analyses as there is no clear process for scaling these measurements to our assumed imfs in the absence of a common original imf assumption .      throughout",
    "we assume the same sfr calibrations as @xcite .",
    "uncertainties in the calibrations for different sfr indicators will correspond to uncertainties in the resulting sfh normalisation for that indicator .",
    "issues regarding sfr calibrations are detailed in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most uncertain calibrations are the radio ( 1.4ghz ) and fir indicators ( although the [ oii ] indicator has a similar level of uncertainty ) . for fir sfrs",
    ", @xcite indicates a variation of about 30% between calibrations in the literature .",
    "@xcite refines the 1.4ghz calibration of @xcite following an exploration of the origins of the radio - fir correlation , and the implication is that the radio sfr calibration has about the same uncertainty as the fir , assuming no contamination by emission from an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) . more significantly , though , for individual galaxies there can be large differences , up to an order of magnitude , in the sfrs inferred through different indicators ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although on average for large samples there is a high level of consistency .",
    "this is reflected in the overall consistency between sfr densities , @xmath21 , estimated from different indicators , with at most about a factor of two or three variation ( which also includes the uncertainty in dust obscuration corrections , where relevant ) .",
    "this scatter is still notably larger than the uncertainties in individual sfr calibrations , and is suggestive of the overall level of systematic uncertainty in the individual calibrations .",
    "it is likely that this reflects subtleties such as low - level agn contamination in various samples , the difficulties with aperture corrections where necessary , dust obscuration uncertainties ( discussed further below ) , and other issues .",
    "it is for these reasons that we neglect the details of the underlying sfr calibrations , as their small formal uncertainties are dominated by these larger systematics .",
    "further , the effect of these systematics between different sfr indicators acts to increase the scatter in the overall sfh compilation , rather than to systematically shift all measurements in a common direction .",
    "so even the factor of two to three variation here can not be viewed precisely as an uncertainty on the sfh normalisation . in this sense",
    ", the level of consistency between @xmath21 measurements using dramatically different samples and sfr indicators , over the whole redshift range up to @xmath22 , is actually quite encouraging .",
    "the issue of dust corrections is complex and has been addressed by many authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite compared assumptions of a ",
    "common \" obscuration correction to a luminosity - dependent correction on the sfh .",
    "the latter leads , for uv and emission line estimators , to somewhat higher values for @xmath21 at higher redshift , although both methods give results essentially consistent with sfh estimators unaffected by obscuration .",
    "@xcite shows that sfrs derived from summing total ir ( @xmath23 m ) and uv indicators using the sfr calibrations of @xcite adopted here , are consistent within a factor of 2 of obscuration corrected h@xmath20 sfrs .",
    "this technique , suggested as the preferred method by @xcite , has the strong advantage that it avoids assumptions about the extent or form of the obscuration , and variations due to possible luminosity bias in the uv selected sample ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to implement effective obscuration corrections for the uv measurements at @xmath4 @xcite , we thus take advantage of the well - established fir sfr densities up to @xmath24 from @xcite .",
    "the uv data at @xmath25 are  obscuration corrected \" by adding the fir sfr density from @xcite to each point .",
    "as shown by @xcite for individual systems , this technique results in @xmath21 estimates consistent with the obscuration corrected h@xmath20 measurements , in particular the recent estimates from @xcite and @xcite , ( also compare the current figure  [ fig : sfh ] to figure  1 of * ? ? ?",
    "this result is consistent with the interpretation of @xcite that about half the sfr density in the local universe is obscured by dust ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , increasing to about 80% by @xmath7 , a trend that can be seen in the different slopes of the ( obscuration corrected ) uv measurements and fir measurements in figure  [ fig : sfh ] . for obscuration corrections to the uv data between @xmath26 we rely on the fact that the fir measurements of @xcite are quite flat in this domain , as well as being highly consistent with those of @xcite at @xmath27 , and add the constant sfr density corresponding to that of @xcite at @xmath24 .",
    "this is also consistent with the recent measurements of obscuration corrections for uv luminosities at @xmath28 by @xcite , who find a typical correction factor of @xmath29 . at higher redshifts",
    "we apply a  common \" obscuration correction to the uv data as detailed in @xcite .",
    "the reliability of this assumption is open to question , but may not be unreasonable , as a comparison with the the measured colour excesses of @xcite illustrates .",
    "the obscuration corrected sfr densities of @xcite at @xmath30 using their measured colour excesses are actually marginally _ higher _ than we derive with the  common \" obscuration correction .      at @xmath32 ,",
    "some clarification is necessary regarding the uv derived @xmath21 measurements .",
    "the two uv measurements at @xmath28 and @xmath33 are taken from the hubble deep field ( hdf ) sample of @xcite , and have been corrected for obscuration by adding to them a constant fir sfr density equal to that at @xmath24 from @xcite .",
    "the three uv points at @xmath34 with comparatively low @xmath21 come from @xcite , and are based on photometric dropouts using the cloning technique detailed by those authors .",
    "these points are low as they correspond to only the high-@xmath35 end of the luminosity function , and are not used here in any subsequent analysis .",
    "the two uv measurements at @xmath36 and @xmath37 are from @xcite , corrected using a  common \" obscuration correction , and are marginally lower than the @xmath21 derived by those authors using their measured @xmath38 colour excesses .",
    "this slight difference has a negligible impact on the fitted parametric forms detailed below , and does not affect any subsequent analysis . at @xmath22",
    "there are now a large number of estimates in the literature , primarily using the photometric dropout technique and hence relying on accurate photometry and colour measurements , all of which are based on small , deep fields ( including the hdf , the great observatories origins deep survey , goods , and the udf ) .",
    "the two highest measurements of @xmath21 at @xmath22 come from goods @xcite and @xmath39-dropouts in two deep acs fields @xcite .",
    "these estimates appear to be high compared to subsequent photometric dropout analyses , and this seems to be a result of sample contamination due to large colour uncertainties from low s / n photometric measurements ( a.  bunker 2005 , private communication ) .",
    "these two points are not used in subsequent analysis .",
    "the lowest measurement of @xmath21 at @xmath22 is from @xcite , based on udf dropouts , and probes to @xmath40 .",
    "contributions from fainter sources are unlikely to increase this measurement by more than a factor of two .",
    "the measurement of @xmath21 between these extremes comes from @xcite , incorporating the largest current sample of @xmath39-dropouts from the udf , udf parallels , and goods .",
    "this measurement supersedes an earlier measurement @xcite using only the udf parallel fields , which is not shown .",
    "although the issue of dust obscuration at high redshift is still highly uncertain , some data is beginning to be obtained .",
    "in addition to the @xmath38 estimates from @xcite , intriguing evidence for significant obscuration ( @xmath41mag ) at @xmath42 has recently been established through spitzer observations of a lensed lyman @xmath20 ( ly@xmath20 ) emitting source @xcite .",
    "this implies that the first epoch of star formation in this source must have occurred around @xmath43 , and moreover that the  common \" obscuration corrections applied to uv luminosity based sfr densities at @xmath44 may not be unreasonable .",
    "this is also supported by spectroscopic ly@xmath20 emission measurements of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath37 @xcite , suggesting that the bright lbgs ( at least ) lie in dusty , chemically evolved systems at this redshift .    at redshifts @xmath45",
    "there have also been recent exciting estimates of the sfh @xcite based on uv luminosities inferred using the photometric dropout technique .",
    "these measurements strongly suggest that the decline in the sfh seen around @xmath22 continues to higher redshifts .",
    "given the very small samples involved , the complete uncertainty regarding the level of obscuration at these redshifts , and more importantly the minimal impact that these data have on the integrated properties of the sfh being explored here , we do not include these points in any of our subsequent analysis .",
    "it is interesting to note , though , that they do appear in general to be consistent with all our results based on the sfh at @xmath46 .    to summarise the impact of dust obscuration corrections on the normalisation of the sfh ,",
    "first the corrections can obviously act only to increase , not decrease , the normalisation .",
    "the technique of uv@xmath47fir measurements gives an effective obscuration correction to the uv data increasing from a factor of two at @xmath48 up to a factor of five at @xmath49 .",
    "these results are consistent with obscuration corrected h@xmath20 estimates for @xmath21 spanning @xmath50 ( the range for which h@xmath20 estimates are available ) , suggesting that the extent of the obscuration correction is unlikely to be much smaller . for @xmath51 this becomes less of a concern as the sfh is dominated by contributions from fir measurements , unaffected by obscuration , which serve as a lower limit to the sfh normalisation . at higher redshifts still ,",
    "the issue is less clear , but the recent results indicated above suggest that even up to @xmath9 dust obscuration may be significant . for the following analysis ,",
    "the @xmath3 flux is dominated by the @xmath52 regime , where the obscuration correction seems fairly well constrained through the uv@xmath47fir technique .      while uncertainties in sfr calibration act to increase",
    "the scatter in the sfh , and uncertainties in dust obscuration can raise it to greater or lesser degrees , the choice of imf is the only assumption that can systematically _ decrease _ the sfh normalisation .",
    "while most authors over the past decade have assumed the traditional @xcite imf for convenience , observations within recent years have strongly ruled it out as a robust model for a universal imf .",
    "a modified salpeter form with a turnover below @xmath53 , though , is still a reasonable model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and other currently favoured imfs include those of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the sfr calibrations for all indicators used here for deriving the sfh estimates , ( which are the same as in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , are defined assuming the @xcite imf . the compilation of data by @xcite converts sfh estimates from the literature to these calibrations , where necessary , to ensure consistent assumptions throughout . to convert sfh estimates to an alternative imf assumption corresponds to simple scale factor .",
    "this scale factor is typically established through population synthesis modelling , using codes such as pegase @xcite , galaxev @xcite , or starburst99 @xcite .",
    "these codes , given an input imf and sfr , can be used to infer the luminosity at sfr - sensitive wavelengths ( typically uv and h@xmath20 ) .",
    "for different imfs , the ratio between the resulting luminosities for a fixed sfr is the required scale factor . to explore these scale factors we used pegase.2 to infer the uv ( 2000 ) and h@xmath20 luminosities , given as input a fixed , constant sfr , for those imfs not excluded by @xcite .",
    "we use the default pegase.2 values for most input parameters , including a close binary mass fraction of 0.05 , evolutionary tracks with stellar winds , and the snii model b of @xcite , but we specify an initial metallicity of @xmath54 , evolving self - consistently .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a comparison between galaxev and pegase.2 ( and also * ? ? ?",
    "* who explore the effect of different input metallicities ) .",
    "for imfs with progressively shallower slopes , it can be seen that the h@xmath20 and uv luminosities scale differently , compared to those derived assuming the @xcite imf , with h@xmath20 being enhanced more quickly than the uv . we choose to follow earlier work , and rely on the uv luminosity for our imf scale factors ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but note that our results would change only marginally if we used the scale factors from the h@xmath20 luminosities .",
    "the scale factors derived for shallower ( flatter , or more top - heavy ) imfs are , in general , smaller than those for steeper imfs .",
    "this results from the top - heavy imfs producing more high mass stars , and consequently more uv or h@xmath20 luminosity , for a fixed total mass or sfr .",
    "conversely , for a fixed uv or h@xmath20 luminosity , a top - heavy imf requires a lower sfr to reproduce that luminosity .",
    "we emphasize that here the _",
    "observed _ quantity is the uv or h@xmath20 luminosity , and the _ derived _ quantity is the sfr .",
    "we investigate here two extreme , but still realistic , imf possibilities .",
    "the factor to convert sfh measurements from a traditional @xcite imf ( with a power law slope of @xmath55 ) to the imf of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bg imf , having a high mass power law slope of @xmath56 ) is @xmath57 ( @xmath58dex ) .",
    "( note that @xcite @xcite quote a high mass slope of @xmath59 in their table  2 , from the local h@xmath20 luminosity density , but also quote @xmath56 as the best - fit from the cosmic sfh . here , as we are interested in the extremes , we choose to use the latter . )",
    "if we used the scaling from the pegase.2 h@xmath20 luminosity , we would have a factor of @xmath60 rather than @xmath57 for the bg imf .",
    "all other imfs explored here vary much less in the relative scaling for the h@xmath20 and uv luminosities . to convert to the modified salpeter a imf ( hereafter sala imf , * ? ? ?",
    "* with high mass power law slope of @xmath55 ) is a factor of 0.77 ( @xmath61dex ) .",
    "the @xcite imf ( high mass power law slope of @xmath62 ) and the modified salpeter b imf ( hereafter salb imf , * ? ? ? * high mass power law slope of @xmath55 ) have scale factors intermediate between these choices . by exploring the impact of assuming the two extreme imf choices we expect to provide bounds encompassing the result from choosing any reasonable imf in our subsequent analysis .",
    "we refer the reader to figure  1 of @xcite for an illustration of these and other various imfs from the literature , and also to table  1 of @xcite .",
    "the application of an imf in this manner neglects , of course , the possibility that the imf is not universal and indeed is even likely to be evolving itself ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "different assumed star formation histories for our own galaxy may also affect estimates for the local imf ( see discussion by * ? ? ? * ) . at any epoch , though , the universe has some average imf , which may have a large scatter around it for individual objects , and this average may vary with epoch .",
    "it is this average imf that the sfh is sensitive to , and this may be different from what is inferred locally in the milky way .",
    "the current measurements do not yet support any detailed exploration of these issues and we ignore them for the current analysis .",
    "in order to derive a @xmath3 flux from the dsnb for comparison with the limits from sk , it is necessary to fit some functional form to the sfh in order to facilitate integration over redshift . we choose to use the parametric form of @xcite as is now commonly used by many authors : @xmath63 , here with @xmath64 .",
    "the individual @xmath21 measurements chosen to constrain this fit are also important since the resulting fit will obviously vary depending on the data used . for @xmath25 , the sfh now appears to be very tightly constrained by the combination of uv data from sdss @xcite , combo17 @xcite , and galex @xcite , corrected for obscuration using the spitzer fir measurements of @xcite .",
    "this use of the fir measurements of @xcite is further supported by their high level of consistency with those from @xcite and the robust local 1.4ghz estimate from @xcite . as a consequence",
    "we use only this set of corrected uv@xmath47fir measurements , along with the @xmath65 h@xmath20 estimate of @xcite , to constrain the parametric fit for @xmath27 .",
    "for @xmath66 we use all the data available in the compilation with exceptions as noted above ( the @xcite @xcite udf estimates , the two highest estimates at @xmath22 , and the three high-@xmath35 only estimates from @xcite @xcite ) and we further exclude the six lowest measurements between @xmath67 . the latter include the three highest redshift [ oii ] estimates from @xcite , and three uv estimates , where the ",
    "common \" obscuration correction assumed is likely to significantly underestimate the true level of obscuration ( compare the uv points between figures  1 and 2 of * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) .",
    "this is not unexpected as the uv luminosity density , in particular , at this redshift probes a very small fraction of the total @xmath21 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    ".    the parametric fitting is a simple @xmath68 fit to the 58 selected @xmath21 measurements spanning @xmath69 .",
    "the corresponding dsnb is calculated following the description in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their equations  1 and 2 ) .",
    "the @xmath70 is first converted to a type  ii supernova rate history , @xmath71 , scaling by the appropriate integral over the imf @xmath72 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where we have neglected the small delays due to the short lifetimes of snii progenitors . for the two imfs explored here we have @xmath73 for the bg imf and @xmath74 for the sala imf .",
    "this illustrates that the choice of imf will affect the derived neutrino production through two separate but related normalisations .",
    "the first comes from how the imf affects the normalisation of the derived sfh from the observed uv , h@xmath20 , or other sfr - sensitive luminosity , the second through this conversion of the sfh into a snii rate history .",
    "the combination of these two factors to some degree converge on similar results , with steeper imfs having higher sfh normalisations , but lower snii rate scalings , and vice - versa . as we show below the bg imf produces snii rates that are a factor of @xmath75 of those from the sala imf ( see also additional discussion below in  [ snii ] ) .",
    "we emphasise that , for a fixed uv , h@xmath20 , or other sfr - sensitive luminosity , a shallower high - mass imf produces fewer snii , while a steeper imf produces more .",
    "if there are fewer snii , this will respect the upper limit on the dsnb flux , but may start to conflict with direct measurements of @xmath76 ( which we take to be a lower limit ) if too few snii are predicted .",
    "the converse applies for the steeper imfs , with more snii predicted .",
    "it should be noted , too , that the snii rate could be derived more directly from ( say ) the uv luminosity , rather than through the calibration to an sfr ( representative of the whole mass range of an imf ) , and then back to a snii rate in this way .",
    "we use this method as it conveniently allows the confidence region fit to the sfh data to be used directly rather than calculating different snii rate conversions for each sfh measurement , depending on the sfr - sensitive wavelength .",
    "we have assumed throughout that all imfs span the mass range @xmath77 . allowing a mass range up to @xmath78 alters most quantities by less than 1% and all quantites by less than 2% , significantly less than the variation between different imf choices , the measurement uncertainties , or other uncertainties affecting the sfh normalisation .",
    "the choice of stellar mass range that gives rise to snii is the largest assumption in this step .",
    "restricting the upper mass limit to @xmath79 reduces the scale factor by about @xmath80 in both cases .",
    "a much greater change is introduced by raising the lower mass limit . with a mass range of only @xmath81 in the numerator of equation  [ sniirate ] ,",
    "the resulting scale factors are reduced by @xmath82 .    the predicted differential neutrino flux ( per unit energy )",
    "is then calculated by integrating @xmath71 multiplied by the @xmath3 emission per supernova , @xmath83 , appropriately redshifted , over cosmic time @xcite : @xmath84 where @xmath85 , @xmath86 is the speed of light , and we are evaluating the thermal emission spectrum @xmath87^{-1},\\ ] ] at the appropriately redshifted energy @xmath88 ( note the choice of units where @xmath89 so that @xmath90 has units of energy ) .",
    "finally , @xmath91 is calculated to establish the @xmath3 flux for comparison with the sk limit of 1.2@xmath10s@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the assumption of a thermal emission spectrum , and the associated choices of temperature , are determined by the eventual decoupling ( after diffusion ) of neutrinos from the hot and dense proto - neutron star , at a radius called the  neutrinosphere \"  @xcite .",
    "we explore the implication of assuming a temperature of @xmath92mev , 6mev , or 8mev , and as in @xcite , we assume @xmath93j@xmath94erg for the total energy carried by all six neutrino flavours . while supernovae emit all flavours of neutrinos and antineutrinos , and each is assumed to carry an approximately equal fraction of the total energy , at present the @xmath3 flavour is the most detectable . because the temperatures of the muon ( @xmath95 ) and tauon ( @xmath96 ) antineutrinos are expected to be higher than for @xmath3 , the effect of neutrino mixing may be to increase the observable @xmath3 flux for a given sfh @xcite ; as in @xcite and @xcite our results apply to an effective temperature after mixing , making them more constraining .",
    "given the @xmath3 flux for each temperature , we simply scale the best fitting sfh to ensure the sk limit is not violated .",
    "this approach has the advantage that the shape of the sfh is determined only by measured data that is differential in redshift , while the normalisation comes directly by imposing the sk @xmath3 limit .",
    "we also explored an alternative approach that did not restrict the fitted shape of the sfh . in this approach , while iterating over the four fitting parameters , each new potential minimum @xmath68 sfh is subjected to the dsnb limit , and the fit is rejected if the limit is violated .",
    "this technique resulted , for the higher @xmath3 temperatures , in fitted sfhs that were significantly low ( compared to the measurements ) in the mid - to - high redshift range , while still matching the @xmath97 and @xmath98 sfh . for the low @xmath3 temperatures , this method gave identical results to the original approach .",
    "our preferred approach emphasises the direct impact of the @xmath3 data appropriately on the @xmath1 measurements , as there are very few detectable neutrinos received from higher redshift .",
    "the best fit sfhs independent of the @xmath3 limit are identical to the fits constrained by a @xmath3 temperature of @xmath99mev .",
    "as found and discussed in @xcite , our results favour effective temperatures at the lower end of the predicted range @xcite .",
    "in addition to the @xcite parameterisation , we also explored a piecewise linear sfh model in @xmath100 space , in order to test the possibility that the @xcite parametric model could be biasing the shape of the resulting sfh fit in some way . in this model",
    "we allow the following six parameters to vary : the @xmath97 intercept , the slopes of three linear segments and the two redshift values at which the slopes change . with this model",

    "these come primarily from the poisson counting statistics of the numbers of observed galaxies contributing to each measurement .",
    "no attempt has been made to resample or reanalyse independent data to appropriately combine their uncertainties , and the effect of multiple independent measurements at similar redshift , each with independently calculated uncertainties ( since the data are heterogeneous ) , is to mimic conservative uncertainty estimates in a homogeneous dataset .",

    "* ) .    at low redshift ,",
    "the discrepancy between the measurements of @xmath119 and the sfh prediction is more of a concern .",
    "a first attempt at resolving this might be to suggest that the measured sfh is too high at @xmath97 , and the technique used ( combining @xmath21 from fir and uv estimates ) is not accurate .",
    "this can not be the whole solution as it does not address the problem at @xmath154 , where the sfh is dominated by the fir contribution , and the @xmath119 values inferred from the sfh are similarly higher than the measurements .",
    "another point against this solution is the equivalent diagram in figure  3 of @xcite , where ( for a salpeter imf ) a broader region , encompassing the majority of sfh measurements , is used to predict @xmath119 rather than the confidence regions fitted here . even in that diagram ,",
    "the @xmath119 measurement at @xmath97 lies at the extreme lower boundary of the sfh prediction .",
    "this suggests that there is something more subtle underlying this discrepancy than simple obscuration correction errors in the sfh .",
    "a partial solution might be found through the underlying measurement techniques used for the different quantities .",
    "the sfh measurements rely on inferring sfrs from the luminosity generated by massive stars , while the @xmath119 measurements come by inferring total stellar masses based on the luminosity of low - mass stars .",

    "almost identical predictions for @xmath76 are obtained for both the sala and salb imfs detailed in @xcite , a consequence of sala having a slightly higher conversion factor than salb for transforming @xmath21 from the traditional salpeter imf , and a slightly lower conversion factor to transform between @xmath21 and @xmath76 .",
    "the bg imf result ( figure  [ fig : snrate1]b ) appears to be marginally more consistent with both the @xmath76 and @xmath137 measurements than the prediction assuming the sala imf ( figure  [ fig : snrate1]a ) although both are acceptable .",
    "the uncertainties affecting the @xmath76 measurements are treated in some detail by @xcite , and the error bars shown are representative of the combination of both statistical and systematic uncertainties",
    ". the @xmath97 measurement may be somewhat low , and recent investigations @xcite suggest that this point is in fact likely to be higher by a factor of two or three , consistent with the sfh predictions .",
    "@xcite indicate that the main concern in the measurements is the level of obscuration , and that a change from their assumed @xmath156 of @xmath157 would alter their measurements by one standard deviation .",
    "it is certainly likely that this is the case for the highest redshift point at @xmath158 , where obscuration is expected to be higher than at lower redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also figure  [ fig : sfh ] ) .",
    "this would have the effect of raising the @xmath158 measurement to be consistent with the predictions from the sfh .",
    "the @xmath76 measurements provide a strong lower bound on the normalisation of the sfh .",
    "particularly given that uncertainty regarding obscuration corrections is more likely to raise than lower the @xmath76 measurements , the sfh normalisation can not realistically be much lower than that obtained from assuming the bg imf ( figure  [ fig : sfhfit]b ) .",
    "the scaling factors for the sfh fits suggest that this provides further evidence against the @xmath109mev assumption , for both assumed imfs",
    ". moreover , the @xmath76 measurements are unlikely to be affected by sufficient obscuration to support an sfh normalisation much higher than that obtained with the sala imf .",
    "the level of obscuration to be inferred in order to make the @xmath76 measurements lie above the upper edge of the sala imf envelope requires @xmath159 at @xmath160 and @xmath161 at @xmath158 .",
    "these values are quite extreme , corresponding to correction factors of approximately @xmath162 and @xmath163 respectively , and values this high are not even inferred from the luminosity dependent obscuration corrections of @xcite for uv data at similar redshifts .",
    "higher sfh normalisations may still be possible , though , and here we return to the assumptions regarding the mass range over which we assume stars become core collapse sne . if we allow only a mass range of @xmath81 , the @xmath76 predictions from the sala imf would be lowered by as much as a factor of @xmath164 ( @xmath165dex ) . assuming this mass range would place predictions from even the traditional salpeter imf at such a level ( i.e. , @xmath166dex from the confidence region in figure  [ fig : snrate1]a ) .",
    "so , at the expense of an increased lower limit of integration for core collapse sn production , imfs providing quite high normalisations for the sfh can still be made consistent with the @xmath76 measurements .",
    "another point to be considered here is the issue of a possible neutrino flux generated from a population of massive stellar objects not observable as snii @xcite .",
    "for example , if stars in the mass range @xmath167 produce the same kind of burst of neutrinos at the end of their life as snii , but do not become core collapse sne , instead progressing directly to a black hole or other exotic end , then the neutrino flux inferred from the sfh via an assumed snii rate will be biased , and the observed snii rate density could legitimately be @xmath168 lower than that predicted from the sfh using this technique .",
    "if even lower mass progenitors become failed supernovae , then this difference could be even larger .",
    "certainly more robust information regarding the connection between the final stages of stellar evolution and neutrino emission would help to refine this type of analysis , and strengthen the implications regarding the favoured sfh normalisation and corresponding imf .",
    "our general conclusions here are ( 1 ) that the imf can not be much more shallow at the high mass end than the bg imf without predicting values for @xmath76 that are too low ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; and ( 2 ) in the absence of a lower integration limit as high as @xmath169 for core collapse sn production , the imf can not produce sfh normalisations much higher than does the sala imf without predicting values for @xmath76 that begin to require quite extreme obscuration corrections .",
    "some slightly less extreme imfs , while still producing higher sfh normalisations than the sala imf , may be allowed if the core collapse sn lower mass cut - off lay between 8 and 10@xmath170 .",
    "this would still seem to be hard to justify , though , as evidence is growing for sn progenitors at these low masses .",
    "the snii analysed by @xcite , for example , ( 2003gd ) , favours a progenitor mass @xmath171 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "a second snii ( 2005cs ) also favors a low progenitor mass , @xmath172 @xcite . to confirm and refine these imf constraints , a larger selection of independent @xmath76 measurements , spanning a broad range of redshift ,",
    "would be invaluable . as noted in @xcite ,",
    "sufficiently precise snii rate data could be used to directly predict the dsnb flux , independently of assumptions about the sfh and imf .",
    "the prediction for @xmath137 from the sfh is also particularly intriguing .",
    "the assumption of the fixed @xmath143gyr has the effect of matching the @xmath173 turnover in the fitted sfh with the apparent decline in @xmath137 seen in the highest redshift measurement from the goods sample of @xcite .",
    "it is possible , indeed probable , that this is simply a coincidence as it is a single @xmath137 measurement , with large uncertainties , that is suggestive of the decline , and the turnover in the sfh is driven almost entirely by the @xmath22 measurement of @xcite .",
    "it is thus still highly possible that the decline in both the sfh and @xmath137 lie at somewhat higher redshift .",
    "in particular , recent spectroscopic results from a complete magnitude limited sample @xcite suggest that the sfh inferred at @xmath174 is up to two or three times higher than that estimated from colour - selected lbgs @xcite .",
    "this may imply that the shape of the sfh is flatter between @xmath175 than our current fits suggest .",
    "even more tantalisingly , the higher sfh estimates from the spectroscopic measurements compared to the colour - selected samples at @xmath176 suggest that the photometric dropout selected samples at even higher redshift ( @xmath22 ) may also be underestimating the total sfh . this effect would be compounded by the recent evidence suggesting non - negligible obscuration at high-@xmath31 @xcite , and appears to provide evidence that the expected high redshift decline in the sfh may still not be well established yet . with this in mind , it is nonetheless interesting to note that the robustness of the goods measurements , again , has been explored in some detail by @xcite who are confident of the reliability of this feature in the @xmath137 data .",
    "if the turnover in the sfh also turns out to be reliable , the @xmath137 evolution can be used to constrain the delay time for snia ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the predictions for @xmath137 are quite different for @xmath152gyr ( figure  [ fig : snrate2]a ) compared with @xmath143gyr , and refining the measurements of @xmath137 between @xmath26 would be quite revealing . alternatively , if the sfh turnover does indeed lie at @xmath177 that would imply either that @xmath178gyr , a result that appears to lie outside the currently favoured range , or that the true turnover in the @xmath137 measurements is also at somewhat higher redshift than the @xmath179 from @xcite .",
    "to explore a more physically motivated connection between snia generation and the underlying stellar populations , @xcite introduced a two component model , dependent on both sfr and stellar mass densities , to derive the snia rate density .",
    "this has the effect of allowing a contribution to the snia rate from old stellar populations where the current sfr may be low , while maintaining a contribution from the currently star forming systems .",
    "taking a logical next step , @xcite allow a delay time to be incorporated into such a two component model , and find a characteristic delay time @xmath180gyr ( given a gaussian distribution of delay times ) , consistent with our simple result above , although their model also includes a contribution from a component proportional to @xmath181 .",

    "the @xmath190 result seems to arise from the strong similarity in shape between the sfh and the @xmath191 evolution , while the @xmath119 evolution has the opposite shape ( increasing to lower redshifts , rather than decreasing ) .",
    "it seems clear that allowing negative values of b would allow some non - zero solution , although what physical interpretation this would have is not clear .",
    "it certainly would not be in the spirit of the model as intended by @xcite .",
    "as concluded above , and since @xmath190 , our tentative inference appears to favour snia delay times close to @xmath192gyr , although there are clearly much more sophisticated models , including those allowing for a distribution in delay times , that we have not explored here , and the locations of the apparent downturns in both @xmath137 and @xmath21 clearly have a very strong influence on this result .      with the best fitting sfh models explored here , the predictions for the dsnb appear to lie excitingly close to the measured @xmath3 flux limit ( figure  [ fig : sneas ] ) .",
    "it is clear that directly observing the dsnb will allow much greater insight into the properties of star formation .",
    "already the dsnb constraint indicates a preferred imf range and normalisation for the sfh .",
    "it also illustrates that stronger constraints on the sfh have implications for understanding the details of both snii and snia production , and the physical basis of neutrino generation by snii is intimately associated with all these predictions .",
    "being able to detect the dsnb and its energy spectrum will allow a more sophisticated analysis of the detailed connections between all these aspects of star formation and the cosmic sfh .",

    "this provides perhaps the best immediate possibility for measuring the dsnb spectrum shape , which , given the minimum normalisation of the sfh assuming the bg imf , seems to be lying just below the current flux limit .",
    "@xcite describe how the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) could improve the current flux limit for dsnb @xmath193 by about three orders of magnitude by coupling the background analysis from sk with the sensitivity to @xmath193 at sno . combining information on both dsnb @xmath193 and @xmath3",
    "populations will allow further exciting insight and constraints on snii neutrino production ( the connection between the two is explored further by * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "an analysis of various uncertainties that may contribute to the normalisation of the sfh has been explored and the imf assumptions play a key role , being essentially the only assumption that can lower the normalisation .",
    "we performed parametric fits to the sfh , using both the form of @xcite and piecewise linear models , both constrained by the sk @xmath3 limit .",
    "the results suggest that the preferred imf should produce sfh normalisations within the range of those from the modified salpeter a imf @xcite and the imf of @xcite .",
    "they also suggest that lower temperatures ( @xmath194mev ) are preferred for the @xmath3 population .",
    "it should be noted that here we have assumed a simple fermi - dirac spectrum for the @xmath3 spectrum after neutrino mixing .",
    "since the current sk energy threshold ( @xmath195mev ) is so high , however , the dsnb flux limit is sensitive to the assumed shape of the spectrum , and a reduction in the height of the spectral tail would allow a higher average neutrino energy .",
    "this highlights the importance of lowering the energy threshold @xcite .",
    "additionally , a more accurate treatment of future data would be based not on the integrated flux above the energy threshold , but rather on the detected event rate spectrum above the energy threshold @xcite , after weighting with the neutrino interaction cross section @xcite .",
    "based on the fits to the sfh we predict the evolution of @xmath181 , @xmath196 and @xmath197 , and compare with observations .",
    "the comparisons with @xmath197 are most revealing , providing the limitations on the assumed imf , and tentatively favouring longer delay times ( @xmath143gyr ) for the snia population .",
    "the @xmath198 measurements provide a key constraint on the sfh normalisation , and correspondingly on the favoured imf . in particular , these data bound the sfh from _ below _ , while the dsnb bounds the sfh from _",
    "above_. ( due to the sk energy threshold , the dsnb flux limit primarily constrains snii with @xmath1 , the same range in which we wish to test the factors that normalize the sfh . )",
    "together , these provide a novel technique for testing or verifying measurements of a universal imf , and emphasises the importance of understanding the range of stellar masses leading to the various stellar evolution core collapse outcomes . more measurements of @xmath197 for both type  ii and ia sne over a broader redshift range @xcite would help to more strongly constrain both the preferred universal imf and the properties of sne . observing the high redshift turnover in the snia rate would also have strong implications for the location of the expected high redshift turnover in the sfh .",
    "direct observation of the dsnb will clearly allow much greater insight into the physics and astrophysics of star formation and supernovae .",
    "given the power of the existing sk @xmath3 flux limit , any improvements in sensitivity will have a very strong impact on constraining the product of the dust corrections , imf normalisation , and neutrino emission per supernova .",
    "in fact , since reasonable choices for all of these already saturate the sk limit , we expect that the significantly improved sensitivity which would be enabled by adding gadolinium to sk @xcite should lead to a first detection of dsnb @xmath3 @xcite .",

    "<S> strong constraints on the cosmic star formation history ( sfh ) have recently been established using ultraviolet and far - infrared measurements , refining the results of numerous measurements over the past decade . taken together , the most recent and robust data indicate a compellingly consistent picture of the sfh out to redshift @xmath0 , with especially tight constraints for @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we fit these data with simple analytical forms , and derive conservative bands to indicate possible variations from the best fits . </S>",
    "<S> since the @xmath1 sfh data are quite _ precise _ , we investigate the sequence of assumptions and corrections that together affect the sfh normalisation , to test their _ accuracy _ , both in this redshift range and beyond . as _ </S>",
    "<S> lower _ limits on this normalisation , we consider the evolution in stellar mass density , metal mass density , and supernova rate density , finding it unlikely that the sfh normalisation is much lower than indicated by our direct fit . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , predictions from the sfh for supernova type  ia rate densities tentatively suggests delay times of @xmath2gyr . as a corresponding _ upper _ limit on the sfh normalisation , we consider the super - kamiokande ( sk ) limit on the electron antineutrino ( @xmath3 ) flux from past core - collapse supernovae , which applies primarily to @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we find consistency with the sfh only if the neutrino temperatures from sn events are relatively modest . </S>",
    "<S> constraints on the assumed initial mass function ( imf ) also become apparent . </S>",
    "<S> the traditional salpeter imf , assumed for convenience by many authors , is known to be a poor representation at low stellar masses ( @xmath5 ) , and we show that recently favoured imfs are also constrained </S>",
    "<S> . in particular , somewhat shallow , or top - heavy , imfs may be preferred , although they can not be too top - heavy . to resolve the outstanding issues , </S>",
    "<S> improved data are called for on the supernova rate density evolution , the ranges of stellar masses leading to core - collapse and type  ia supernovae , and the antineutrino and neutrino backgrounds from core - collapse supernovae . </S>"
