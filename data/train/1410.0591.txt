    "the type  ii point @xmath96 is known as the _ gauss point_. the remaining points of @xmath22 , knowns as the type  iv points , correspond to equivalence classes of descending chains @xmath97 of disks in @xmath0 with empty intersection .",

    "given @xmath91 and @xmath92 , @xmath100 will denote a certain closed subset whose type  i points are those in @xmath101 , and whose type  ii and  iii points are of the form @xmath102 with @xmath103 .",
    "similarly , @xmath104 is a certain open subset whose type  i points are those in @xmath105 , and whose type  ii and  iii points are of the form @xmath102 with @xmath106 _ other than _ @xmath94 itself .    more generally , a _ closed berkovich disk _ is a subset of @xmath22 of the form either @xmath107 or @xmath108 .",

    "the unique path - connectedness endows @xmath22 with a tree - like structure ; however , unlike a finite tree , it has points of infinite branching , and such points are dense in any interval @xmath118 $ ] with @xmath128 .",
    "in fact , these infinitely - branched points are precisely the type  ii points , because for any type  ii point @xmath120 , the complement @xmath129 consists of infinitely many connected components , called the _ residue classes _ at @xmath114 .",
    "each of these components is an open berkovich disk : one is @xmath108 , while the rest are the infinitely many disks @xmath130 with @xmath131 .",

    "in addition , if @xmath135 is either of type  i or type  iv , then @xmath129 is still connected .",
    "the set @xmath24 is called _ hyperbolic space _ and admits a metric @xmath25 , which can be easily described on the type  ii and  iii points .",
    "given @xmath91 and @xmath136 , we have @xmath137 the hyperbolic distance between two points @xmath94 and @xmath102 is then the sum of the distances from each point to @xmath138 , where @xmath139 is the smallest closed disk in @xmath0 containing both @xmath101 and @xmath140 .",
    "the reader should be warned , however , that the @xmath25-metric topology on @xmath26 is strictly stronger than gelfand topology , and hence the former is known as the _ strong topology_. however , if @xmath34 is a finite tree , then the gelfand and strong topologies each induce the same subspace topology on @xmath49 .",
