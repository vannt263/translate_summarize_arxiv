    "this keeps the trap geometry constant within @xmath93 , and the magnetic field at the trap bottom within @xmath94 of the `` magic '' value of @xmath95 , where the differential zeeman shift between @xmath20 and @xmath28 vanishes to first order @xcite .",
    "we transport the atoms by smoothly ramping all parameters from @xmath87 to their final value during @xmath1 .",

    "we expect @xmath133 , a linear fit to the data ( including the independently measured detection noise at @xmath134 ) yields @xmath135 .",
    "we attribute this to an error in calculating the density profiles , as our imaging system only partially resolves the clouds , and correct for it by dividing @xmath119 and @xmath120 by @xmath136 .",
    "we verify the linearity of the imaging by comparing a high - resolution ramsey measurement ( @xmath49 ) to the expected sinusoidal fit , and find that the slope of our ramsey fringes deviates by at most @xmath137 from the model .",
    "together with the calibration uncertainty , this results in a total systematic uncertainty of @xmath93 ( @xmath138 ) in @xmath32 .",
    "even though we achieve small shot - to - shot fluctuations in @xmath6 , our interferometer is sensitive to a density - dependent level shift arising from mean - field interactions .",
    "we measure this shift to be @xmath139 , based on the coherent - state reference data used in figure 2 . we can measure @xmath6 much better than the preparation noise , and we correct for the shift for each shot individually @xcite . without this correction , the scanning probe interferometer would still perform below the sql at @xmath140 , and our interferometer would remain sub - sql for @xmath141 ."

    "<S> the entanglement - enhanced interferometric sensor demonstrated here is about three orders of magnitude more sensitive and offers higher spatial resolution .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have experimentally demonstrated a scanning probe atom interferometer operating beyond the standard quantum limit , and used it for the measurement of a microwave near - field . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first demonstration of entanglement - enhanced atom interferometry with a high spatial resolution scanning probe , and promises further high - resolution sensing and measurement applications . </S>",
    "<S> a particularly important challenge is to demonstrate similar scanning capability and sub - sql operation with an atom interferometer that measures inertial forces or surface potentials on a small length scale @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this requires that the atomic wave functions are spatially split during the interrogation time @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> our atom chip allows for the implementation of such a sequence @xcite , but an important additional requirement for sub - sql operation is to suppress the nonlinearity @xmath30 in the split state while the interferometer phase is accumulated . </S>",
    "<S> one strategy to achieve this is to decrease the trap frequency after splitting the trap , as @xmath30 scales with the inverse density . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative is to choose a different atomic species where a feshbach resonance can be used to tune the interaction strength to zero @xcite .    </S>",
