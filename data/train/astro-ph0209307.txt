    "the former uncertainties have often been neglected in comparison with the latter , where external errors ( i.e. uncertainties on the input assumptions ) have been much discussed , e.g. @xcite or @xcite . however , the _ predicted _ integrated properties of small stellar systems suffer from large intrinsic dispersions arising from the very nature of the systems : sampling fluctuations from , say , the initial mass function ( imf ) will give rise to fluctuations in the properties and hence to an intrinsic dispersion in the predictions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "integrated quantities which scale linearly with the number of stars ( such as the luminosity in a given photometric band , or the overall spectral energy distribution , sed ) can be predicted for any stellar system from the scaled - down outputs of synthesis codes with effectively predict properties for very large stellar systems , that is , systems which fully sample the distribution function of masses .",
    "however , for quantities which do _ not _ scale _ linearly _ with the number of stars , such as luminosity ratios , magnitudes , colours , equivalent widths , etc , such a scaling can not be performed properly , and the only solution is to make extensive monte carlo simulations .",
    "we can already foresee that biases will arise from the incomplete sampling of the underlying distribution function .",
    "for instance , infrared colours may be dominated , at some ages , by a handful of high luminosity , ir - bright stars .",
    "monte carlo simulations calculated by @xcite  show that the average colour is a function of the number of stars in the simulation .",
    "similarly , the average optical colours of stellar clusters , at a given age , are functions of the total mass in the cluster , as shown for instance by @xcite and more recently by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this is best illustrated with an example in a simple colour - colour diagram .",
    "figure [ fig : gtc ] shows the point ( indicated by the @xmath4 symbol ) where a 10 myr - old stellar population with an infinite number of stars would be .",
    "each triangle in each panel represents one monte carlo simulation of a 10 myr - old stellar population with a total number of stars ( with masses between 2 and 120 m@xmath1 distributed with a salpeter imf ) of 1000 , 100 , 10 and 1 star , respectively=1000 stars within 2 and 120 m@xmath1 have a weight of @xmath5 m@xmath1 , and would the imf be extended down to 0.08 m@xmath1 , the mass of the cluster would be @xmath6=@xmath7 m@xmath1 . ] .",
    "figure [ fig : gtc ] shows three important effects :    _ ( a ) _ the distribution of colours in this diagram is clearly bimodal or even multimodal . the points do not cluster around a well - defined center , but are very scattered over the entire diagram , at odds with the ( standard ) predicted value for an infinitely - large stellar population .",
    "_ ( b ) _ if the average colour is computed for clusters with the same number of stars , its value is very different from the one given by the standard prediction : the average colour is biased , and the bias depends on the total number of stars present in the population .    _",
    "( c ) _ the area covered by the points ( each representing one monte carlo simulation ) is not a monotonic function of the number of stars in the simulation .",
    "note that these effects are not limited of course to clusters of this age , but do also appear in more evolved populations , since these effects are a generic feature of under - sampled clusters , @xmath8 and @xmath9 m@xmath1 at different ages . ] .    in this paper",
    "we provide a first order analytical estimation on _ when and why synthesis models which use an analytical formulation of the imf are not be able to reproduce the observed properties of stellar systems _ and therefore when monte carlo simulations are absolutely required in order to make predictions .",
    "we show that bias and multimodality features are a _",
    "generic _ property of non - linear functions of the sed , and will always be present when trying to apply population synthesis models to small size stellar populations .",
    "their importance can not be stressed enough : many of the seemingly peculiar properties of some systems can , at least in part , be accounted for by this bias and multimodality effects .    this is an important issue since odd values of these properties often lead to non standard interpretations .",
    "for instance , when colours or equivalent widths ( ews ) of small stellar systems appear to be peculiar ( that is , peculiar with respect to the values predicted by synthesis models of a large number of stars ) , they are often interpreted in terms of imf variability : either the mass cutoffs have to be truncated , and/or the slope of the imf has to be changed in order to produce the correct colours or ews . since the lower mass cutoff determines the overall mass - to - light ratio , it is usually the upper mass limit which is varied to account for the data .",
    "examples of these interpretations abound in the recent literature , starting perhaps with @xcite who , on the basis of the variation of the equivalent width of h@xmath10 in hii regions across m 101 , inferred a dependence of the upper mass cutoff with metallicity .",
    "line ratios included in classical diagnostic diagrams have also been used ( e.g. @xcite , and @xcite for the softness parameter ) and seem to show that the imf changes in extragalactic hii regions ( but see however * ? ? ? * for an alternative explanation based on sampling effects ) .",
    "colours , and colour - colour diagrams , sometimes including the h@xmath11 line , of clusters and starbursts also seem to point to variations in the parameters of the imf , from the lmc @xcite , to clusters in the starburst galaxy ic10 @xcite .",
    "the common features of all these interpretations which point to a variation of the imf are ( i ) the systematic use of non - linear quantities ( ews , line ratios , colours ) and ( ii ) observations of small stellar systems ( hii regions , stellar clusters , starbursts , etc ) .    given the scaling arguments explained above , it is interesting to see whether sampling effects could account for this type of observations .",
    "in this paper we show that whilst the _ average _ values of the properties ( and their _ dispersions _ ) that scale with the number of stars are reasonably well reproduced by the models , non - linear functions such as luminosity ratios or colours may be heavily biased .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to analyse in detail each and every observation , but given our results , it appears very likely that the peculiar properties observed in some systems can be simply understood in terms of the bias and multimodality introduced by sampling fluctuations of the imf in these stellar systems .",
    "this has profound implications for the interpretation of colours , average magnitudes and line ratios in such systems , as well as for the universality ( or otherwise ) of the imf .",
    "these effects seem to be large enough that most observations may point to the universality of the imf , despite a variety of physical conditions ( e.g. @xcite for a general review and @xcite for the case of starburst galaxies ) , and therefore provide a unique insight on star formation processes in a variety of environments .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following : in sec .",
    " 2 we recall the scaling properties of synthesis models . in sec .",
    " 3 we analyse the statical properties of functions of the sed , showing the biases and multimodalities that appear in their distribution functions .",
    "we discuss these results and their implications in sec .",
    " 4 and  5 .",
    "population synthesis models often scale predictions to the total mass in stars .",
    "there are at least two reasons for this .",
    "first , a ( suitable ) fixed mass - to - light ratio can be achieved .",
    "second , the predictions , which are made for a unit star formation rate ( that is , the rate at which a given gas mass is transformed into stars ) , can be scaled to other rates , or , equivalently , to other masses in gas or stars .",
    "the underlying mathematical justification for this scaling is simple to see .",
    "take for example the average total luminosity in a given band @xmath12 .",
    "this is given by the weighted sum of the luminosities @xmath13 of the @xmath14 stars present in a population at some given age :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the number of initial ( zero - age ) masses considered such that @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the ( integer ) number of stars of type or class @xmath19 . for a sample of different size @xmath20 , all other parameters kept the same ( age , metallicity , etc ) , the following scaling applies :    @xmath21    this scaling arises because , at a fixed age , @xmath13 are constants whilst @xmath18 follow a poisson distribution ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the average value of a ( weighted ) sum of poisson variables is the ( weighted ) sum of average values .",
    "it is this linear scaling that allows predictions made for a given @xmath22 to be scaled up or down for a different number of stars .",
    "however , the scaling is always made with the total _ mass _ in stars , not the actual _ number _ of stars @xmath22 present in a population .",
    "obviously , for a fixed imf , there is a direct relation between the total mass in stars and the number of stars , but there is an important difference in that the total mass , @xmath23 is a _ random variable _ when @xmath22 is fixed ( and vice versa ) .",
    "the pdf of @xmath23 , as of any function of the imf , can be obtained analytically using the characteristic function method ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although the inversion can be cumbersome or indeed unworkable . for the purposes of the present paper",
    "it is enough to show the pdf of @xmath23 obtained from monte carlo simulations .        for @xmath24",
    "the pdf of @xmath23 is trivially the imf itself ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : imf1 ] bottom right ) , while for large values of @xmath22 the central limit theorem ensures that it converges to a gaussian function ( fig .",
    "[ fig : imf1 ] top left ) . for intermediate values of @xmath22 ,",
    "the distribution has a heavy tail at large values of @xmath23 , as fig .",
    "[ fig : imf1 ] shows .",
    "note also that this tail is not sampled well enough even though 10@xmath25 simulations were made , with clusters populated by 1000 stars of masses between 2 and 120 m@xmath1 distributed with a salpeter imf .",
    "the heavy tails are a direct result of the poor sampling of the upper mass range , where the presence of a few massive stars can be very significant for the total mass in a small system .",
    "the large dispersion in @xmath23 , at @xmath22 fixed , shows that synthesis models which use an analytical sampling of the imf overlook a fraction of the intrinsic dispersion inherent to the nature of the problem : small stellar systems will _ always _ show a dispersion in @xmath23 event though @xmath22 is kept fixed , and inversely .",
    "so not only using @xmath22 is the natural choice for the scaling , but it also leads to take into account one of the factors which produce an intrinsic dispersion in the observables .    the evaluation of the dispersion in @xmath23 requires to know the corresponding pdf , but we can estimate how it scales with @xmath22 from the results of the monte carlo simulations .",
    "let us assume that the imf , @xmath26 , is given by a power law :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is a normalisation constant .",
    "if the imf is defined between some mass cutoffs @xmath29 and @xmath30 , the normalisation constant is given by :    @xmath31    in the case of only one star , the _ average _ value of the stellar mass is given by    @xmath32    and its variance by    @xmath33    so , square of its relative error is    @xmath34 \\times \\nonumber \\\\ & &   \\left [ \\frac{(m_{\\mathrm{up}}^{1-\\alpha } - m_{\\mathrm{low}}^{1-\\alpha})}{(1-\\alpha ) } \\right]- 1 .",
    "\\label{eq : mnvarrel } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for the particular case of a salpeter imf , with cutoffs at 2 and 120 @xmath35 , these values are @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 = 1.481 .    in general",
    ", @xmath23 is proportional to @xmath22 .",
    "it can be seen that the variance , @xmath39 is also proportional to @xmath22 .",
    "therefore the relative error in @xmath23 is inversely proportional to the square root of the number of stars .",
    "for stellar populations with a large number of stars , the dispersion becomes negligible ( e.g. , 0.01 per cent for a system of 2@xmath40 stars ) and quantities which depend linearly on the number of stars can be normalised safely to @xmath23 rather than to @xmath22 ( which becomes difficult to measure in such cases ! ) .",
    "and @xmath41 luminosities and their corresponding effective number of stars , @xmath42 , normalised to the actual number of stars @xmath22 .",
    "this is the evolution predicted for an infinite population of stars , fully sampling a salpeter imf between 2120 m@xmath1.,width=264 ]    in order to establish how relevant the effect of sampling is , we have followed the evolution of each monte carlo simulation of stellar clusters of fixed @xmath22 , and derived their integrated luminosities in the @xmath43 and @xmath44 bands .    using the ensemble of simulations at fixed @xmath22",
    ", we have obtained mean values and dispersions for these luminosities , their @xmath45 , the @xmath46 ratio and the @xmath3 colour . to avoid introducing further parameters in this study",
    ", we used the @xcite atmosphere models and solar metallicity tracks with standard mass - loss rates form @xcite . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", the nebular contribution to the luminosity has not been taken into account in these runs .",
    "although monte carlo simulations seem the natural , and only , way to estimate the pdf of any observable , @xcite showed that it is possible to apply a poissonian formalism which allows the estimation of the first two moments of the pdf analytically .",
    "this formalism is based on the idea that there is only an _ effective number of stars _ , @xmath42 , which contribute to a given observable .",
    "its definition is related to the quasi - poissonian nature of the luminosity pdf .",
    "for example , for the observable monochromatic luminosity @xmath47 , its effective number @xmath48 is given by the expression    @xmath49    as first derived by @xcite .",
    "note that this effective number is not an actual number of stars , but rather a measure of the weighted number of sources which contribute to a given observable .",
    "the larger the effective number , the better determined will the observable be .",
    "small values of @xmath48 indicate an intrinsically large dispersion , and typically arise when a few ( real ) stars dominate the observable .",
    "for instance in young clusters a few very massive stars may dominate the overall energy budget or the sed .",
    "in old stellar populations , a few asymptotic giant branch stars ( agb ) may change significantly the luminosity . hence in both situations one expects an intrinsically large dispersion in the observable , a direct result of the discrete nature of these small populations which sample incompletely the imf but dominate the observable .",
    "figure [ fig : cvglmh ] shows , for reference , the time evolution of the @xmath50 and @xmath41 luminosities ( normalised to the number of stars in the cluster ) , for a stellar population which fully samples the given imf , that is , with an infinite number of stars in the indicated mass range , along with the evolution of their effective number of stars @xmath0 , which readily allows an estimate of the intrinsic dispersion in these luminosities via eq . ( [ eq : neff ] ) , for any stellar population of any size and any age .",
    "these were some of the results obtained by @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to see some values of @xmath51 . from fig .",
    "[ fig : cvglmh ] can be seen that @xmath52 stars are needed to obtain @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) values larger than 10 .",
    "this means cluster masses around @xmath55 m@xmath1 in the mass range 2120 m@xmath1 , and would the imf be extended down to 0.08 m@xmath1 , the mass of the cluster would be @xmath6=@xmath56 m@xmath1 .    for young stellar populations , @xmath42 values for different luminosities normalised to the stellar cluster mass assuming a salpeter imf in the mass range 2 - 120 m@xmath1 can be found in http://www.laeff.esa.es / users / mcs / sed/.    in the case of old stellar populations @xmath42 has been computed directly by @xcite .",
    "additional estimations can be obtained from the evaluation of brightness fluctuations , @xmath57 as shown by @xcite , where @xmath58 is the magnitude in a given band and @xmath59 is the brightness fluctuations in magnitudes in the same band , and the term @xmath60 is used to obtain the corresponding @xmath61 value normalised to the cluster stellar mass for stars masses in the mass range 0.08120 m@xmath1 following a salpeter imf slope , instead the normalisation used by @xcite : 10@xmath62 m@xmath1 in the mass range 0.12 m@xmath1 . ] .                  in general , a linear combination of poisson variables will not be another poisson variable , unless the weights take integer values ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a discussion ) .",
    "however , the fact that it is a _ linear _ combination of random variables allows one to estimate _",
    "exactly _ its first two moments , even though the remaining moments can sometimes be also determined analytically .",
    "this is well illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : lum ] which shows the comparison of the monte carlo simulations with the fully - sampled results for the @xmath50 and @xmath41 observables .",
    "the agreement is very good in all cases , with small deviations when the number of stars in the cluster decreases . except in rare occasions , the analytical expressions obtained via eq .",
    "( [ eq : neff ] ) are within 3 per cent and 5 per cent of the monte carlo ones .",
    "not only the average values agree at this level ( and hence are _ not _ biased ) but also the estimation of the dispersion is very good , over a dynamical range of three orders of magnitude in the total number of stars . _ linear functions of the luminosity ( such as luminosities integrated in a photometric band , or ionising fluxes ) are not biased .",
    "_    remarkably , our poissonian formalism is also able to predict the mean value and dispersion for simulations of clusters which contain only one star . in this case",
    ", the imf gives us the relative weight of the probability @xmath63 to obtain a star with a given luminosity @xmath64 .",
    "the mean value , taking each cluster as a one realisation , is    @xmath65    with dispersion    @xmath66    eq .",
    "( [ eq : neff ] ) implies that when @xmath42 is very small @xmath67 , and so poisson dispersions and monte carlo ones become very similar .    the highly variable correlation coefficient between @xmath50 and @xmath41",
    "is also predicted correctly by the poisson formalism , as shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : lum ] .",
    "the agreement is in fact at the 2 per cent level for most ages .",
    "it shows that a ( variable ) fraction of stars contribute in luminosity to both bands , and therefore the actual dispersions in these luminosities must take into account this important term if errors are to be evaluated properly . as @xcite showed , the effect of not including this term is to systematically underestimate the dispersion .",
    "so far so good for the first two moments , but what about the actual shape of the pdf of these luminosities ? could the deviations from the poisson formalism be accounted for deviations in the pdf ?",
    "figures [ fig : pdflv ] and [ fig : pdflk ] give these pdfs at selected ages in terms of the variable @xmath68 . note the logarithmic scale on the vertical axis .",
    "the vertical dashed lines give the values of @xmath69 , which , as shown above , are very close to unity and hence are not biased .",
    "it is interesting to note that whereas the mean value of the simulations are well reproduced , the _ median _ value and the _ most probable _ ( mode ) values are shifted to the left in all cases .",
    "this effect must be taken into account when the result of standard synthesis models are compared with individual clusters .    at early ages",
    "most stars are close to the zams , and hence the mass - luminosity relation makes that the pdf in luminosity is very similar to the pdf distribution in total mass ( compare with fig .",
    "[ fig : imf1 ] ) . as stars evolve , post - ms evolutionary stages are reached , and obviously the longer the stage , the better sampled it is .",
    "this gives rise to secondary peaks in the pdf , where stars can accumulate , leading to multi - modality in the luminosity distribution .",
    "the number of such stars will be smaller than 1 per cent of the stellar population of the cluster .",
    "when the total number of stars is low , there is a non - zero probability that the cluster will have no post - ms .",
    "so , for a given fixed number of stars , it is possible to have clusters ( sharing the same total number of stars ) with or without post - ms stars , a clear case of possible bimodality when the observable depends on the presence ( or otherwise ) of post - ms stars .",
    "this effect was first pointed out in the pioneering work by @xcite .",
    "we stress again that the average values are not biased , and that the deviations from the poisson distribution are relatively small in terms of the first two moments only .",
    "obviously higher moments are far more sensitive to shorter evolutionary stages , and hence more prone to sampling effects .",
    "we can nevertheless quantify these deviations in terms of @xmath61 .",
    "a poisson distribution defined by a parameter smaller than @xmath70 , has a probability larger than 1 per cent to have a number of effective sources equal to zero .",
    "as mentioned before , the number of effective sources is not an actual number of stars , but rather a measure of the effect of ( under-)sampling in these clusters . for @xmath61 values between 5 and 0.1 , the probability of having a cluster with zero effective sources increases from 1 per cent to 90 per cent . for even smaller values of @xmath61 most clusters will have no effective sources in that band , because they do not contain stars in the suitable evolutionary phase which contributes to the observable .",
    "we therefore expect that when @xmath61 is in the range between about 5 and 0.1 bimodality will be most easily observed .",
    "again , @xmath61 is an observable - dependent quantity , so it is possible that some clusters have large @xmath61 values for some quantities but small values for others . if these quantities are linear functions of the sed or the luminosity , then their average values are not biased .",
    "any non - linear function will , on the contrary , be prone to biases and may enhance multimodality , as we show in the following sections .",
    "in general , standard synthesis codes compute logarithmic quantities assuming implicitely that their average value is the logarithm of the average .",
    "for the logarithm of the luminosity this would be for instance    @xmath71    and the corresponding dispersion would be evaluated as    @xmath72    this is obviously not correct in general , since the assumption relies implicitely on an infinitely narrow - peaked pdf for @xmath47 , which is seldom the case .",
    "let us assume a sample of observations of a definite - positive random variable @xmath47 described by a pdf @xmath73 .",
    "the expectation value @xmath74 of any function of this variable @xmath75 is    @xmath76    take for instance the case where @xmath47 is the luminosity in some photometric band .",
    "the corresponding magnitude is @xmath77 , with @xmath78 some zero point and @xmath79 .",
    "its average value is    @xmath80    with the new variable @xmath81 , whose pdf is @xmath82 such that of course @xmath83 , this results in    @xmath84    therefore , unless @xmath85 ( where @xmath86 is dirac s delta function ) that is , when the pdf of @xmath47 is defined _ only _ at @xmath87  the average of the logarithmic quantity will not be the logarithm of the average value of the variable .",
    "the proper computation of the @xmath82 functions can be only performed with a massive number of monte carlo simulations . from this properly - sampled @xmath82",
    "one could extract samples of @xmath88 for any sample of size @xmath22 , but this is obviously unpractical .",
    "if this is nevertheless not done , then the estimated values are very likely to be biased .",
    "a rough estimate of the bias can be evaluated by expanding in taylor series . for the magnitude",
    "@xmath58 this is    @xmath89    so that , to first order , the mean value of the magnitude , and its variance are    @xmath90    to first order , the bias is then @xmath91 , so if @xmath92 is large enough , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : meanlog ] ) and ( [ eq : siglog ] ) are good approximations .",
    "in many cases @xmath92 will be small and the bias important .",
    "( [ eq : magcor ] ) gives a lower limit to the bias ( since higher order corrections were not taken into account ) and the only way to estimate the bias is , inevitably , via monte carlo simulations .",
    "this is done in fig .",
    "[ fig : loglum ] where this analytical estimate is compared with the monte carlo ones ( middle and right panels ) .    alternatively , in terms of difference in magnitude    @xmath93    we see that the bias can reach some 0.5 magnitudes in @xmath94 and 2.5 magnitudes in @xmath95 for clusters with 100 stars between 2 and 120 @xmath35 , and 2 magnitudes in @xmath94 and @xmath96 magnitudes in @xmath95 for groups of 10 stars in that mass range .",
    "we can also see that using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : meanlog ] ) and [ eq : siglog ] give systematically wrong results , because they predict systematically too large values .",

    "the estimates given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : magcor ] ) are indicated with symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig : loglum ] .",

    "however , for smaller values of @xmath100 the situation is entirely different . in this case",

    "when more massive clusters are considered , these post - ms peaks grow in importance , become better sampled , and eventually the bias disappears .",
    "rational functions of luminosities are even more important in the interpretation of the properties of small stellar systems because , naively , they seem to be independent of normalisation problems , since the usual scaling with mass or number of stars cancels out . but this may not be necessarily the case , and , in addition , their dispersion due to the uneven sampling of the imf can be dramatically large .    in standard synthesis models it is assumed that for a rational function @xmath104 its average value is given by    @xmath105    and its dispersion is given by :    @xmath106    where @xmath107 is the correlation coefficient between @xmath88 and @xmath108 .",
    "again , this would be correct if the distribution of @xmath109 would be a very narrow peak , but in the general case this is not correct . for a function @xmath110",
    ", the average value is given by    @xmath111    where @xmath112 . again , unless @xmath85 ,    @xmath113    and , more generally , @xmath114    with a second - order taylor expansion one gets , to first order    @xmath115    and , in general , for a rational function @xmath104    @xmath116    to first order approximation , the bias is then of the order of @xmath117 , and the correct estimation of the mean value of a ratio requires the covariance between the numerator and denominator .",
    "again , we illustrate here these effects with the simple ratio @xmath46 in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] , where eqs .",
    "( [ eq : meanratio ] ) and ( [ eq : sigratio ] ) produce a very severe bias , even larger than one order of magnitude , both in the average and in the dispersion .",
    "the symbols show the results using eq .",
    "( [ eq : rcor ] ) and they have the same meaning as in fig .",
    "[ fig : loglum ] except for filled symbols , which now correspond to @xmath54 and @xmath53 values lower than 10 . in this case , the use of the eq .",
    "( [ eq : rcor ] ) only produces a marginally better result than eq .",
    "( [ eq : meanratio ] ) .",
    "note that in the case of @xmath118 there are fewer points computed with eq .",
    "( [ eq : rcor ] ) than in the case of the mean value .",
    "this is just because , for some values , eq .",
    "( [ eq : rcor ] ) produces negative @xmath119 values and the use of these equations is not valid .",
    "it is interesting to see that the bias can be positive or negative , a direct consequence of the time variability of the correlation coefficient between the two luminosities .",
    "the corresponding pdfs are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdfratio ] . in this case",
    ", bimodality is apparent for a wide range of situations , and again , it is due to a secondary peak with larger values of the @xmath46 ratio . the bias may increase or decrease the average value , as shown by the vertical dashed lines .",
    "it is remarkable to see that the actual dispersion for the more massive clusters , at 10 myr for example , is actually larger than the dispersion in less massive clusters .",
    "again this is due to the presence of very massive stars , better sampled in these massive clusters , which have in comparison a much smaller flux in the @xmath44 band , and hence a very large @xmath46 ratio .",
    "the behaviour of the bias with the number of stars is clearly non - monotonic , as shown also in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] .",
    "+ finally , in the case of log - rational functions ( such as integrated colours ) there will be a priori a double bias , arising from the use of two non - linear functions . and",
    "yet most codes will still assume that the colours of a stellar population will not depend on its total mass .",
    "we take again as an example the @xmath3 colour . to first order",
    ",    @xmath120    note that in this case the bias does not dependent on the correlation coefficient , and it has a value of approximately @xmath121 . since redder wavelengths have a lower @xmath61 value ( in this range of ages ) than shorter wavelengths ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) , this approximation for the bias indicates that predictions of synthesis models must be corrected with a blue shift in order to get back to the actual _ mean _ value of a set of observed clusters . note that for older clusters ( say , above 1 gyr or so ) , the trend is reversed since redder wavelengths ( cooler evolutionary phases ) become better sampled .",
    "the situation is illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : vk ] and [ fig : pdfvk ] .",
    "the top right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : vk ] shows the mean @xmath3 colour for the different sets of simulations . in this case",
    ", the difference between actual colours and those predicted by fully - sampled synthesis models can reach more than 3 magnitudes , even for the most massive clusters .",
    "in the case of young star forming regions ( younger than some 20 myr ) , red colours have lower @xmath61 values than blue ones ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "the resulting bias shows that the predictions of synthesis models must be corrected toward blue colours in order to reproduce the _",
    "mean _ value of a set of observed clusters . at older ages ,",
    "the bias may turn to bluer or redder values depending on the age , that is , on the proportion of post - ms versus main sequence stars .",
    "another interesting result shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] and [ fig : vk ] is the corresponding @xmath122 value . in the case of gaussian distributions",
    ", @xmath122 corresponds to the half width of maximum at about 60 per cent of the full height . in our case , the pdfs are not gaussians , but @xmath122 still gives us the width of the distribution at some ( undefined ) height .",
    "the monte carlo simulations show that at some ages ( when post - ms stars appear in the clusters ) , the @xmath122 value is maximum for the simulations with 100 stars and decreases for even fewer stars .",
    "this value is also related with the area covered by the simulations in fig .",
    "[ fig : gtc ] , where the dispersion in the diagram is maximum for simulations with 100 stars .",
    "as we have already seen , this maximum @xmath122 value is also related with a larger probability of obtaining bimodal distributions .",
    "the reason of this behaviour is that most of the clusters with a smaller number of stars will not have the post - ms phases sampled at all .",
    "this is also consistent with the lack of evolution in the @xmath46 ratio and the @xmath3 colour .",
    "so , the probability of finding a cluster with post - ms falls below the width of the level defined by @xmath122 . for more populated clusters ,",
    "almost all of them will be reproduced correctly by standard synthesis models with a non - zero number of post - ms stars .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that this behaviour is also present in simulations performed by @xcite . in his diagrams",
    "there is a maximum dispersion for the simulations with 10@xmath25 @xmath35 that decreases for simulations with 10@xmath123 @xmath35 .",
    "also , the bias effect is clearly present in his monte carlo simulations since the colours of these simulations do not agree with his analytical predictions .",
    "the comparison of observations with the results of a population synthesis method is in fact an inverse problem : given the data , what are the models which best fit the data , given the errors in the data ?",
    "it is seldom the case that errors within the models are also taken into account .",
    "it is also important to analyse whether the best fitting models are also good fits , and whether the solution is unique or not . in the case of synthesis models",
    "this procedure is often neglected and a variation in the input parameters is much preferred .",
    "we have shown in the previous sections two major problems .",
    "first , the usual scaling with the total mass of the stellar population should not be made when dealing with small systems ( dwarf galaxies , starbursts , stellar clusters , pixels , etc ) .",
    "second , observables which are non - linear functions of the sed ( or equivalently of the monochromatic luminosity ) may present not only multimodal distribution functions , but also a systematic bias in the average values of these observables , with respect to the values predicted by codes which fully sample the imf .",
    "these effects have been overlooked in the past , because most synthesis codes do not provide an estimate of the intrinsic dispersion of the observables . whilst this was easy to understand",
    "when dealing with the integrated properties of massive stellar populations , such as spiral and elliptical galaxies , this becomes a serious problem if such codes are applied to smaller stellar systems .",
    "formally , the first moment of the pdf of a given observable can not be scaled down properly .",
    "a possible solution would be to have the pdf of the observable and then extract samples of small size from that pdf . in this way the statistical properties of the observable , in small samples ,",
    "can be analysed and compared with the observations .",
    "the only proper solution to deal with the two problems we have discussed in this paper , multimodality and bias , is therefore to perform monte carlo simulations to construct the pdf of the observable .",
    "this is often unpractical , and we have shown that the quasi - poisson formalism that we have developed can account for the statistical properties of the first two moments at a very good approximation level . although the formalism can not account for higher order moments , and thus to allow for strong deviations in the pdfs , it does not suffer from systematics and can easily ( and should ) be included in any synthesis code .    as we mentioned before , it has often been the case that the easiest solution to account for peculiar observations was to change some of the input parameters of the synthesis code , and in particular the properties of the imf .",
    "it is well beyond the scope of this paper to analyse in detail each and every claim for variations of the imf in small stellar systems , but we will illustrate here how sampling effects may have been mistakenly overlooked .",
    "we take again the @xmath3 colour , a non - linear function of the sed , as an example .",
    "figure [ fig : vkimf ] ( right panel ) shows its evolution with time when the upper mass limit of the imf is changed .",
    "it is readily apparent that if an observation gives a very blue @xmath3 colour , and all other parameters are the same ( such as mass , luminosity , etc ) within a small range , then it is tempting to hastily conclude that the upper mass limit in that particular system has to decrease .",
    "but in fact , as fig .",
    "[ fig : vk ] shows , not only the average colour changes with the mass of the system , but also a large dispersion is expected , arising _ only _ from sampling fluctuations . similarly , fig .",
    "[ fig : vkimf ] ( left panel ) shows the effect of varying the slope of the imf .",
    "again , a too blue colour may be interpreted as evidence for a steeper slope .",
    "while our results can not confirm or reject possible imf variations in these systems , they however clearly indicate that part ( if not all ) of the dispersion in the @xmath3 colour may be accounted for by the incomplete sampling of a single , universal imf .    two final comments .",
    "first , in some cases there is no need for a bias to be present to explain some peculiar properties of small stellar systems .",
    "all the values quoted in fig . [ fig : vkimf ] lie in fact in the predicted band quoted by the maximum and minimum @xmath3 values obtained from the simulations of clusters with 1000 stars ( where the bias is small ) .",
    "the very large dispersion , an expected intrinsic property due to incomplete sampling , may account for many of the observed values , with no need to invoke special properties . as an example , in high - metallicity regions with wolf - rayet stars , the dispersion of synthesis models around their mean value is enough to explain the observations , as shown by @xcite .",
    "second , another interesting effect concerns the ages of these systems , as inferred from non - linear functions of the luminosity . because these observables may have a wide , multimodal distribution function , the intrinsic dispersion which may be observed in a given sample is not necessarily a reflection of a variation in the properties of individual members of that sample .",
    "it appears very dangerous to infer ages or mass variations from these small systems .",
    "in this work we have found important effects which have been overlooked in the application of population synthesis codes to small stellar systems such as clusters , starbursts , dwarf galaxies or pixels .",
    "most current synthesis codes predict the average values of observables for an infinitely large population of stars , which samples perfectly a given imf . extrapolating these predictions to small stellar systems may be misleading .",
    "first , scaling observables with the mass in stars is not correct for small systems .",
    "the proper scaling should be performed with the total number of stars present in the system .",
    "second , the distribution functions of observables which are non - linear functions of the monochromatic luminosity ( or sed ) may show multimodality .",
    "this implies that for a given population , of fixed size , and all other parameters kept the same , there will be a large dispersion in the observable , whose average value will not necessarily be the same as the one predicted when the imf is fully sampled .",
    "most synthesis codes will therefore lead to biased predictions when applied to small stellar systems .",
    "third , we have also shown that bimodality is a natural effect that appears when stellar systems are affected by sampling ( i.e. the number of stars in the clusters is not enough to sample completely the imf ) .",
    "it is related to the evolutionary speed of different masses , or in more graphical terms , to the absence / presence of stars in some evolutionary phases .",
    "this effect was already shown 14 years ago by @xcite .",
    "we have now established the range of @xmath61 values ( from @xmath124 5 to 1 ) where bimodality appears .",
    "an additional result is that bimodality will be more easily observed when infrared colours are used since such colours are more affected by the presence of short - lived post - ms phases .",
    "fourth , while we can not confirm or reject the hypothesis of possible variations in the properties of the imf in small stellar systems , these results suggest that an important fraction of the dispersion observed in non - linear observables is not necessarily evidence for imf variations , but can rather be accounted for by sampling fluctuations .    finally , we have also derived an operational limit to the validity of standard synthesis codes .",
    "there is a critical effective number of stars ( unrelated to an actual number of stars ) , with a value of around 10 , which defines a boundary where multimodality may appear , i.e. cluster masses larger than 10@xmath2 m@xmath1 for a salpeter imf in the range 0.08  120 m@xmath1 ( but the exact value for the cluster masses depends on the age and the observable ) . below this critical value",
    ", the results of the codes must be taken with caution , since not only they can be biased , but also they may underestimate the actual dispersion of the observable , and monte carlo simulations are required .",
    "the reason for the existence of this critical value is directly related to the presence ( or otherwise ) of stellar evolutionary stages which are not fully sampled in small systems .    we encourage the inclusion of the calculation of this effective number of sources for a given observable in all synthesis codes , so that observers ( and theoreticians alike ) can estimate the expected dispersion ( and possible biases ) in observables .",
