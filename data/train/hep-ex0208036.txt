    "@xmath0 leptons are not only a precision measurement tool , but also a sensitive probe for physics beyond the standard model . in this note",
    "we review the importance of their contribution and the results obtained at the delphi experiment at lep .",
    "several extensions to the standard model predict the existence of new particles involving @xmath0 leptons in the resulting final state .",
    "data collected at lep2 at centre - of - mass energies from 130 gev to 209 gev were used in the different analyses , with a total integrated luminosity of about 650 pb@xmath1 .",
    "delphi was one of the four detectors operating at the lep collider from 1989 to 2000 .",
    "it was designed as a general purpose detector for @xmath2 physics with special emphasis on precise tracking and vertex determination and on powerful particle identification .",
    "a detailed description of the delphi detector can be found in @xcite and the detector and trigger performance in @xcite .",
    "charged particle tracks are reconstructed by a system of tracking chambers inside the 1.2  t solenoidal magnetic field : the vertex detector ( vd ) , the inner detector ( i d ) , the time projection chamber ( tpc ) and the outer detector ( od ) in the barrel region ; two sets of planar drift chambers aligned perpendicular to the beam axis ( forward chambers a and b ) measure tracks in the forward and backward directions .",
    "the vd consists of three cylindrical layers of silicon detectors , at radii 6.3  cm , 9.0  cm and 11.0  cm , and polar angle acceptance from 24@xmath3 to 156@xmath3 .",
    "all three layers measure coordinates in the plane transverse to the beam ( @xmath4 ) , and at least two of the layers also measure @xmath5 coordinates along the beam direction .",
    "the i d consists of a cylindrical drift chamber with inner radius 12  cm and outer radius 22  cm , surrounded by 5 layers of straw tubes , having a polar acceptance between 15@xmath3 and 165@xmath3 .",
    "the tpc , the principal tracking device of delphi , consists of a 2.7  m long cylinder of 30  cm inner radius and 122  cm outer radius .",
    "each end - plate of the tpc is divided into 6 sectors with 192 sense wires and 16 circular pad rows per sector .",
    "the wires help in charged particle identification by measuring the specific energy loss ( de / dx ) and the pad rows are used for 3 dimensional space - point reconstruction .",
    "the od consists of 5 layers of drift cells at radii between 192  cm and 208  cm , covering polar angles between 43@xmath3 and 137@xmath3 .",
    "the electromagnetic calorimeters consist of a high density projection chamber ( hpc ) covering the polar angle region from 40@xmath3 to 140@xmath3 and , a forward electromagnetic calorimeter ( femc ) covering the polar angle regions from 11@xmath3 to 36@xmath3 and from 144@xmath3 to 169@xmath3 .",
    "the scintillator tile calorimeter ( stic ) extends the polar angle coverage down to 1.66@xmath3 from the beam axis in both directions .",
    "the hadron calorimeter ( hcal ) covers 98% of the solid angle .",
    "the muons which traverse the hcal are recorded in a set of muon drift chambers placed in the barrel , forward and backward regions .",
    "the ring imaging cherenkov ( rich ) detectors of delphi  provide charged particle identification in both the barrel ( brich ) and forward ( frich ) regions .",
    "in addition , a set of scintillation counters were added to veto photons in blind regions of the electromagnetic calorimeter at polar angles near 40 , 90 and 140 degrees .",
    "an isolated particle was identified as a muon if it gave signal in the muon chambers or left a signal in the calorimeters compatible with a mip .",
    "it was identified as an electron if its energy deposition in the electromagnetic calorimeters was compatible with its measured momentum and the ionisation loss in the tpc was compatible with that expected from an electron of that momentum .",
    "if an electron or muon had low momentum , it was assumed to come from @xmath0 decay and was therefore tagged as @xmath0 .",
    "in addition isolated jets with an energy of at least 5 gev , at least one and at most five charged tracks and no more than ten particles in total were also considered as @xmath0 candidates .",
    "the @xmath0 decays were classified into the following categories : @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and others according to the lepton identification , the number of charged tracks of the jet and the number of photons .",
    "several searches with @xmath0 leptons in the final state are reviewed . here",
    ", we will explain briefly the @xmath0 channels and will present the results with the combination of the rest of the possible decay channels .",
    "the standard model ( sm ) higgs search has been one of the most important goals at lep2 .",
    "a scalar higgs could be produced at lep in the process @xmath11 . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , the production of the lightest scalar higgs boson , h , proceeds through the same processes as in the sm .",

    "the same analysis was applied in the four channels with @xmath0 leptons  @xcite .    after a hadronic preselection a search for @xmath0 lepton candidates",
    "was then performed using a likelihood ratio technique .",
    "the likelihood variable was calculated for the preselected particles using distributions of the particle momentum , of its isolation angle and of the probability that it came from the primary vertex .",
    "pairs of @xmath0 candidates were then selected requiring opposite charges , an opening angle greater than @xmath17 and a product of the @xmath0 likelihood variables above 0.45 . if more than one pair was selected , only the pair with the highest product was kept . for the final selection",
    "another likelihood variable is built with the following variables : the rescaling factors of the @xmath0 jets , the @xmath0 momenta and the global variable .",

    "the couplings are completely specified in terms of the electric charge and the weak mixing angle , @xmath27 , and therefore the production cross - section depends only on the charged higgs boson mass .",
    "higgs bosons couples to mass and therefore decay preferentially to heavy particles , but the precise branching ratios may vary significantly depending on the model . in 2hdm type ii , where the down / up fermions couple to @xmath28/@xmath29 higgs fields respectively",

    "apart from the reconstructed mass , which is not possible to reconstruct in the leptonic channel , there are two important difference to discriminate both contributions : the @xmath0 polarization and the boson production polar angle .",
    "* @xmath0 polarization : + assuming that the @xmath35 has a definite helicity , the polarization ( @xmath36 ) of tau leptons originating from heavy boson decays is determined entirely by the properties of weak interactions and the nature of the parent boson .",

    "the @xmath0 weak decay induces a dependence of the angular and momentum distributions on polarization .",
    "once the @xmath0 decay channel is identified , the information on the @xmath0 polarization was extracted from the observed kinematic distributions of its decay products , e.g. angles and momenta .",
    "these estimators are equivalent to those used at the z peak for precision measurements  @xcite . for charged higgs boson masses close to the threshold ,",

    "in the leptonic channel , the selection is performed in similar way to the @xmath52  @xcite .",
    "after that selection , a likelihood to separate the signal from the background was built using six variables : the estimators of the @xmath0 polarization , the boson polar angle of both @xmath0 leptons , the acoplanarity and the total transverse momentum .",
