    "nucleotide sequences on dna of high organisms display a mosaic structure in such a way that expressed sequences ( _ exons _ ) are interrupted by intervening sequences ( _ introns _ ) which do not code for aminoacids @xcite . up to the present , the role of introns are not unraveled although there are beliefs that their presence on the eukaryotic genome promote biological stability since mutations on noncoding regions are not expected to affect information contents regarding protein synthesis @xcite .",
    "uncertainties on whether introns have been either introduced into or withdrawn from embryonic sequences of nucleotides have raised doubts on the common assumption that procaryotic genome is primitive relatively to the eukaryotic genome .",
    "up till now , the dispute between introns - early @xcite and introns - late @xcite hypotheses appears to be unresolved .",
    "it is worth to notice in this respect that there are evidences favoring the presence of exons of all sizes on eukaryotic sequences and the existence of a close relationship between exons distribution along such sequences and protein structure @xcite .",
    "the question of whether such a distribution has a prebiotic origin is then closely related to the introns - early / introns - late dilemma @xcite .    in the last few years",
    "there have been numerous efforts to rationalize the genetic information stored in dna nucleotide sequences from a statistical viewpoint @xcite .",
    "apart from differences of methodology in using _ genbank _",
    "data base , these works present numerical information on the two - point autocorrelation function @xmath0 in one - dimensional space ( or its fourier transform power spectrum ) , for nucleotide separation distance @xmath1 ( in appropriate units ) on a same dna strand .",
    "the essential question addressed in these works relates to disclose long - range correlations ( or , equivalently , power - law behavior ) in these sequences by distinguishing nucleotides according to their pyrimidine ( cytosine , thymine ) or purine ( adenine , guanine ) base content .",
    "criteria based on the number of hydrogen - bonds linking complementary nucleotides in pairs have also been used .    in this context",
    ", the relevance of the coding and noncoding parts of eukaryotic sequences for interpreting the genetic information of dna has been upraised since s. nees suggestion that the ultimate source of long - range correlations reported in early studies @xcite , could be the underlined mosaic structure of genome @xcite .",
    "this observation has led to further studies on purine and pyrimidine organization along separate coding and noncoding sequences .",
    "nevertheless , the question on whether the mosaic structure of the genome is responsible for signaling long range order in purine - pyrimidine distribution , remains under debate @xcite .    from a physical viewpoint one of the interests of studying statistical properties of the genome",
    "resides on the fact that , by finding long- range behavior for @xmath0 , one might address the origin of nucleotide base sequences organization to a critical phenomenon that eventually occurred during biological evolution . in this respect",
    ", one can find in the literature nonequilibrium statistical mechanics models proposed to describe the dynamics of nucleotide sequences under the action of some natural evolutionary driving processes @xcite .",
    "we choose to address questions related to the genome organization by distinguishing nucleotides not between purines and pyrimidines but instead , regardless their base content , by distinguishing nucleotides according their loci on an exon or intron region of a dna sequence .",
    "we believe that direct information on statistical properties of mosaic structure shall be helpful for tracing the origins and functions of introns , which is our main concern here .",
    "the focus of our studies on nucleotide sequences was entirely suggested by the results obtained for equilibrium properties of a statistical mechanics model proposed recently to investigate conditions for isotopic order ( or `` isotopic fractionation '' ) on a harmonic crystal chain containing isotopic impurities @xcite . on the basis of an appropriated map ( see below ) , we argue that this model is also suitable for describing some features of dna concerning , in particular , its mosaic structure .",
    "the relevant aspect of the original model equilibrium thermodynamics we want to emphasize here is that at temperatures below a certain critical temperature @xmath2 , it displays a condensed phase in which impurities aggregate into clusters of all sizes . within this phase",
    ", the cluster distribution function and two - point auto - correlation functions are expected to exhibit temperature dependent power - law decay @xcite .",
    "moreover , it was also found in ref .",
    "@xcite that for masses @xmath3 of host particles and @xmath4 of impurities satisfying the particular relationship @xmath5 the critical temperature for condensation can attain very high values @xcite .",
    "making a parallel of this model with a similar description for dna molecule , allows us to conjecture that the origin of dna mosaic structure might have been due to a _ codon _",
    "@xcite condensation into clusters ( or _ exons _ ) that eventually occurred during prebiotic synthesis of some nucleic acids . within this picture",
    ", we suggest that thermodynamical stability of dna with respect to small spatial fluctuations of its molecular components had a crucial role for establishment of an ordered state ( mosaic structure ) in which codons appear segregated from protein noncoding regions . important",
    "to stress is that the present proposal do not relate to the emergence of particular sequences of purine and pyrimidine bases ; it is restricted to the mosaic features , regardless base content .    in section 2 we review the model of ref . @xcite and extend the results in order to estimate the asymptotic behavior of related pair correlations functions and clusters size distribution .",
    "on the basis of a map of this model onto dna nucleotide sequences suggested in section 3 , we show some numerical results for these quantities obtained in preliminary studies using data from _",
    "genbank_. a discussion is in section 4 .",
    "here we review the original model of ref . @xcite and explore some of its statistical properties to describe aspects of systems of interest .",
    "as mentioned , the original lattice model hamiltonian describes a one dimensional crystal containing isotopic impurities interacting by harmonic potential @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are respectively , the displacement from equilibrium position and mass of the particle at lattice site @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 is a common force constant .",

    "@xcite is whether in this situation the phonons of the lattice could induce positional correlations among impurities leading to some sort of isotopic order at thermodynamical equilibrium .",

    "term @xmath41 whose asymptotic behavior is given by @xmath42 as _ l _ goes to infinity , with @xmath43 and a cluster bulk energy @xmath44 , in agreement to the model studied in ref .",
    "accordingly , @xmath45    in the following we make further considerations to discuss the nature of the phase transition exhibited by this model on the basis of equations ( [ fator ] ) and ( [ deltaf ] ) .",
    "it is our purpose here to characterize the phase transition displayed by the model above in the limit of very low impurity density . for this",

    "however , this limit attains finite values in regions where @xmath73 consequently , at sufficiently low temperatures the statistical properties of the system are governed by the lvy distribution @xmath74 with @xmath75 which characterizes its condensed phase . within this phase",

    "@xmath79 indicates averages over statistical ensemble of the system .",
    "since the only contribution to the truncated function ( [ corr ] ) comes from configurations in which the considered two points are covered by a single cluster we can use the approach introduced in the last section and estimate the behavior of @xmath80 at the condensed phase by the probability of finding any cluster of size greater or equal than @xmath81 using result ( [ pllim ] ) , we then disclose asymptotic power - law behavior @xmath82 with @xmath83 as expected @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we remark that @xmath84 within this phase .",
    "it is our intention in this section to suggest a map of the model reviewed above in order to describe aspects of dna eukaryotic sequences . for this purpose ,",
    "it is relevant to notice in eq .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) that for @xmath85 i.e. , for @xmath86 the critical temperature of condensation @xmath72 can attain arbitrarily large values [ see eq .",
    "( [ tc ] ) ] .",
    "this result leads us to make some conjectures concerning coding and noncoding organization along some nucleotide sequences :    \\(i ) let us assume that small positional displacements of nucleotides with respect to their equilibrium positions along dna @xmath87-helix backbone , which in turn generate phonons , are relevant degrees of freedom of the macromolecule and can be accounted by the lattice model hamiltonian in eq.([hamilt ] ) . for this , we assume also that the two dna complementary strands can be represented by a single chain of harmonic oscillators placed along that direction .",
    "accordingly , we shall consider that any two nucleotides linked by h - bonds in complementary pairs are , in certain conditions , constrained to move along chain direction as a single particle of mass ( fig 1a ) :    @xmath88    or @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the mass of an adenine ( thymine , cytosine or guanine ) base and @xmath91 is the mass of remaining sugar and phosphate components of nucleotides .",
    "@xmath92    due to the fact that either complementary pair at or cg comprise a two - carbon ring purine base and a one - carbon pyrimidine joint to attain a three - ring base pair ( see fig.1b ) , we can ascribe within reasonable approximation the mass of a host particle @xmath3 defined in the model for isotopes , to the mass of any combination a - t or c - g , i.e. @xmath93    \\(ii ) in addition , we consider the possibility that eventually in our dna lattice model there are present some triplets of consecutive complementary pairs of nucleotides which are also constrained ( by action of mechanisms external to the system ) to move as single particles ; each of these comprises then six nucleotides .",
    "the number of such assembled triplets is controlled by a chemical potential @xmath94    in view of ( [ host single ] ) we can then ascribe a mass @xmath4 of `` impurities '' particles to any of these triplets in such a way that relation ( [ codon ] ) holds , i.e. @xmath95 for @xmath96 integers assuming any value of the interval @xmath97 $ ] but subjected to the condition @xmath98",
    "\\(iii ) finally , the assembled triplets are to be identified here with _ codons _",
    "( accompanied by their complementary nucleotides ) , which are the units of genome contents information .    in analogy to the model of last section ,",
    "we assign site dependent spinlike variables@xmath99 to the lattice ordered points such that @xmath100 notice that by this procedure , each codon occupies a single lattice site .",
    "notice also that , according to our purposes , the defined set @xmath101 for chosen nucleotide sequences disregard differences concerning the nature of purine - pyrimidine base pairs .    steps ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) accomplish the map .",
    "let us examine some of its consequences .",
    "we are now able to make some quantitative predictions on the structure of eukaryotic dna sequences with respect to the distribution of coding regions .    according to the results of sec .",
    "2.2 , and the above map , we expect that the size distribution of coding regions along eukaryotic gene sequences , which we refer here as dna mosaic structure @xcite , follows the power - law ( [ pllim ] ) with @xmath102 , in analogy to the distribution of clusters of isotopic impurities of the physical model at condensed phase .    in order to get support for this conjecture we select sequences from _ genbank _ and check for this property .",
    "we focus on saccharomyces chromosomes ( scchriii , scchrix , yscchrvin ) which are among the longest intron - containing sequences available at that data bank .",
    "we notice that such sequences were selected from available _  _ data upon requirement of presenting complete coding as well as noncoding regions ( cds sequences ) .",
    "figure 2 shows histograms where there are depicted the diverse sizes of the respective coding regions . to extract representative functions for these diagrams in each case we test both polynomial and exponential fittings which are also shown .",
    "@xmath103      in the same context we examine the behavior of codon pair correlation functions .",
    "figure 3 shows the variation of @xmath0 with codon pair distance @xmath104 for various intron - containing nucleotide sequences taken from _",
    "genbank_. these curves have been obtained upon assignments ( [ sigma1 ] ) , and assuming ergodicity of the systems of interest so that for each sequence , we replace the ensemble averages indicated in ( [ corr ] ) by `` temporal '' averages @xmath105 where the sequence length @xmath49 is measured in nucleotide units .",
    "3 shows our results for @xmath0 obtained by evaluation of expression ( [ corr5 ] ) on the same dna sequences studied last section and considering periodic boundary conditions .",
    "@xmath106 comments on these results are in sec.4 .",
    "the above ideas relate to the origin and function of genome mosaic organization .",
    "they are based on the results obtained previously for equilibrium properties of a one - dimensional harmonic lattice chain model of two isotopic components ( masses @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) which was proposed recently for studying isotopic fractionation . in favorable thermodynamic conditions ,",
    "this model exhibits a condensed phase in which segregation takes place , giving rise to macroscopic regions of just one component @xcite . in order to use these results to pursue a description of dna mosaic structure , we focus on the multiscale characteristic predicted for the distribution of such aggregates and on the fact that the critical temperature for phase transition can attain very high values for a particular set of values for model parameters ( i.e. for @xmath107)@xmath108 in this case , the condensed phase should be stable in a broad range of temperatures including , in particular , our present room temperatures .    on the basis of the map of section 3 , we",
    "are then lead to suggest : ( i ) that the mosaic structure might have had its origins in a condensation phenomena of _ codons _ that took place at prebiotic conditions , and ( ii ) this mosaic structure , being _ thermodynamically _ @xmath109 with respect to the distribution of coding and noncoding sequences , might in fact be related to the _  biological _ _ stability _ of the genome of high organisms since it is believed that the presence of noncoding sequences ensures relative low probabilities of harmful mutations on the genome @xcite .    in order to find support to the model and to check for the plausibility of related assumptions , we explore the fact that both exon size distribution functions and codon correlation functions are predicted to display power - law decay according to expressions ( [ pllim ] ) and ( [ limcorr ] ) respectively .",
    "it is remarkable in this respect that the decay power in both cases are predicted to be temperature dependent .",
    "this fact shall be of some relevance from a biological point of view , for it provides information on the thermodynamics of gene formation .",
    "we select sequences from _ genbank _ for which calculation of these quantities were performed .",
    "the results obtained are shown in figures 2 and 3 . in these calculations",
    "we distinguish nucleotides according to their loci on a coding or noncoding region of each sequence , in agreement to our assumptions .",
    "let us focus on the results obtained for pair correlations of selected chromosome sequences , and restrict the analysis to the range of two - point distances depicted in figure 3 .",
    "we notice that correlation curves for all chosen sequences are smooth only in a relative small range , exhibiting in the remaining an oscillatory behavior due , probably , to the absence of experimental information on coding and non - coding regions in all representative scales @xcite .",
    "even so , we observe that the decay profile of the curves in figure 3 can in principle be fitted by either exponential or polynomial functions .",
    "although the characteristic decay parameter in each of the exponentials shown is very small ( i.e. , not greater than @xmath110 @xmath111 see table 1 ) we should not , on the basis of these results alone , discard the possibility of exponential in favor of polynomial fittings . in face of this",
    ", the situation then appears to be inconclusive concerning long - range order of coding regions in eukaryotic sequences of nucleotides .",
    "@xmath112    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath112    _ table 1 _ - results of polynomial fitting exponents for exons size distribution , @xmath113 and codon correlation functions , @xmath114 ( fig.2 and 3 respectively ) , along the saccharomyces chromosome nucleotide sequences indicated .",
    "experimental information on coding and non - coding regions along each of these sequences were taken from _",
    "data bank .",
    "@xmath115 and @xmath116 are the corresponding results for exponential fitting coefficients .",
    "last column shows the difference @xmath117 obtained in each case . according to our theoretical predictions",
    ", this difference is expected to be of order one .",
    "let us now focus on the numerical results obtained for exons size distribution .",
    "the fact that there are present in the histograms many gaps in different positions corroborates our conjectures above on the oscillatory behavior of correlation functions .",
    "figure 2 presents both exponential and polynomial fittings for the referred histograms .",
    "we observe that also in this case either fittings seem to be adequate although , as for the case of correlations , the decay parameter of each of the fitted exponentials is very small .",
    "additional evidences in favor of polynomial fittings can nevertheless be obtained in case of distribution functions .",
    "in fact , as can be observed in figure 2 , rare events , namely , relative large coding regions present in each sequence can only be accounted by polynomial fitting curves with @xmath118 , in agreement to our predictions .",
    "moreover , if we compare the decay profiles of related correlation and distribution polynomial fittings we find that the differences between the corresponding decay coefficients for all of the sequences studied is of order one , as predicted by our model [ compare expressions ( [ pllim ] ) and ( [ limcorr ] ) with results in the last column of table 1 ) .    in conclusion",
    ", although our numerical studies lack more information on other scales of coding and non - coding regions of genome , it is still possible to obtain strong support for the use of the model of section 2 to describe aspects of dna mosaic structure , on the basis of a joint analysis of available experimental data on both exons size distribution and codon correlation functions .       finally , we comment on the hypothesis of section 3 . in our opinion , it is important for the model credibility to find reasons at least for some of the stated assumptions , which we review here : a ) in our dna lattice model , some triplets of nucleotides complementary pairs are constrained to behave as single particles concerning their interactions with the remaining system , in contrast to other pairs which are not constrained in this way ; b ) in special conditions ( prebiotic ) , all particles can interchange positions with each other .",
    "one possibility to think on these is to imagine triplets being assembled at the required prebiotic conditions , by the action of external agents that are able to promote aggregation of any three consecutive nucleotide complementary pairs at random positions on the lattice .",
    "details of physical mechanisms involved in this kind of process are immaterial here , since it is also assumed that it happens in a in a very short time scale if compared to the lattice relaxation time . within this picture",
    ", the coding regions of dna would emerge due to a possible sequential action of these external agents . according to the results presented here , stabilization of macroscopic sequences of such triplets though",
    ", would be favorable only at regions of temperatures below @xmath119",

    "<S> in view of the critical behavior exhibited by a statistical model describing a one dimensional crystal containing isotopic impurities and the fact that for impurity mass parameter 3 times the host mass the critical temperature can attain very high values , we suggest that the mosaic structure displayed by certain nucleic acids ( dna ) of eukaryotic organisms might have had its origins in a phenomenon of condensation of _ codons _ ocurred at prebiotic conditions . </S>",
    "<S> an appropriated map of that model onto some of the dna features allows one to predict power law behavior for both correlation functions and exons size distribution in binary sequences of nucleotides which are distinguished by their protein coding or noncoding functions . </S>",
    "<S> preliminary studies of these quantities performed on intron - containing sequences from _ genbank _ are presented here . </S>"
