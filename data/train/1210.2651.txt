    "the study of the injection of charge carriers into a gaseous or fluid dielectric is important for elucidating processes of both technological and fundamental interest whose knowledge is still far to be complete  @xcite .",
    "electrons can be emitted in several ways , for instance , using photo-  @xcite or tunnel cathodes  @xcite .",
    "they are directly injected into the conduction band of the dielectric medium .",
    "the energy separation between the fermi level in the emitter and the bottom of the conduction band of the insulator can be measured  @xcite .",
    "this methodological approach allows researchers to investigate the energy levels of the electrons in the medium and to shed light on the nature of their states in a dielectric host  @xcite .",
    "the energy , with which electrons are injected into the medium , is typically in excess of thermal .",
    "the excess energy is continuously dissipated via scattering events that eventually lead electrons to thermalization . under the action of an externally applied electric field in competition with the image force field ,",
    "electrons drift towards the anode , at which they are collected .",
    "the measured electron mobility is determined by scattering processes  @xcite .",
    "however , some of the injected electrons can be backscattered via the same scattering mechanisms and can be recaptured by the cathode .",
    "thus , a measure of the electron collection efficiency may give useful pieces of information about the scattering processes a hot electron undergoes on its way to thermalization  @xcite .",
    "it is expected that mobility- and collection efficiency measurements give a coherent picture of the scattering processes involving the excess electrons and the atoms of the medium .",
    "dense rare gases represent a model system of a disordered medium .",
    "the possibility of easily varying their density in a wide range between the dilute gas- ( with density @xmath5nm@xmath6 ) and the liquid region ( @xmath7nm@xmath6 ) allows researchers to study how the electronic state and transport properties depend on density and degree of disorder .    in the past ,",
    "young and bradbury ( yb ) developed a simple yet successful model to relate the collection efficiency of photoelectrons injected into a dilute rare gas to the strength of an electric field externally applied to the electrodes  @xcite . according to this model , the collection efficiency is determined by the scattering processes and the scattering cross section can be determined from the electric field dependence of the collection efficiency .",
    "this model is quite successful at predicting the overall dependence of the collection efficiency on the electric field strength at low gas density though the hypotheses , on which it is based , are somehow unreasonable .",
    "more recently , the injection of electrons in dense argon gas and liquid has been investigated by using thin - film cold - cathode emitters  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the data according to the yb model in a wide density range has resulted in an unexpected density dependence of the electron - atom momentum transfer scattering cross section . although the collection efficiency data of smejtek _ et al .",
    "_ agree very well with our more recent measurements  @xcite , their determination of the cross section is wrong because the correct description of the multiple scattering ( ms ) effects , which are very important at high density , was unavailable at the time of their measurements  @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations based on monte carlo ( mc ) techniques based on classical trajectories have also been carried out in order to statistically investigate the electron injection process as a function of electric field and temperature in a way that is not influenced by the flaws of the yb model  @xcite . as a matter of fact ,",
    "mc simulations lead to a correct field dependence of the charge collected at the anode without giving a physical explanation of the result .",
    "moreover , they fail at predicting the density dependence of the experimental observation because , even in this case , the ms effects are not accounted for at all .",
    "nowadays , the scattering processes in gases at high density are very well understood  @xcite and the rle of ms is clear .",
    "the difference with scattering at low density is due to the fact that multiple scattering affects the electron - atom scattering cross section .",
    "the analysis of the drift mobility data has resulted in the formulation of a unified heuristic model , in which ms effects lead to a density dependence of the effective cross section  @xcite .",
    "this model agrees well with the mobility data in gases endowed with positive scattering length ( such as helium and neon )  @xcite up to densities , at which localization of electrons in density fluctuations sets in  @xcite , and agrees with the mobility results in negative length gases ( argon ) up to even larger densities because electrons still propagate through them as quasifree particles with very long mean free path ( mfp )  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical tools for the correct interpretation of the charge collection process are thus available .",
    "for this reason , within our program aimed at measuring the electron drift mobility in dense rare gases we have also carried out measurements of charge collection efficiency .    in previous papers",
    "we have reported the experimental data in the one - phase region of argon for @xmath8k below the critical temperature  @xcite as well as for @xmath9k in the supercritical region  @xcite .",
    "those measurements have been analyzed in terms of the yb model by taking into account the ms effect as requested by the model developed for the drift mobility .",
    "the main result is that the effective , density - dependent momentum transfer scattering cross section determined from the analysis of the collection efficiency data is absolutely compatible with its determination from the drift mobility measurements and that it can theoretically be calculated using the experimental zero - density electron- atom scattering cross section .",
    "in this paper we present further data at @xmath2k and @xmath0k . on one hand ,",
    "the goal of the measurements is to confirm the prediction of the analysis carried out for the previously investigated temperatures . on the other hand ,",
    "the temperature @xmath0k has been chosen because it is so close to the critical temperature @xmath10k that very large densities can easily be reached .",
    "both series of measurements confirm the results of the yb analysis .",
    "however , the data at weak field of the lower @xmath11 isotherm unexpectedly show that another phenomenon , namely electrostriction , determines the collection efficiency of electrons .",

    "further purification is accomplished by flowing the gas through an oxisorb filter ( messer griesheim , germany)@xcite so as to reduce the impurity content down into the parts per billion range or less as required to carry out accurate electron mobility measurements@xcite .",
    "the gas density is computed from temperature and pressure by using an accurate equation of state@xcite .",
    "an ultraviolet ( uv)-grade quartz window coated with a @xmath15 nm thick au layer is used as both photocathode and electrode for the drift voltage@xcite .",
    "the uv light source is a commercially available xe flash lamp ( hamamatsu , model l2435 ) delivering light pulses lasting @xmath16s each .",
    "the emitted light spectrum can be described by an asymmetric gaussian peak centered at a wavelength @xmath17 nm with left and right widths @xmath18 nm , respectively .",
    "@xmath19 corresponds to photons of @xmath20ev energy .",
    "the light is guided onto the photocathode by means of a uv - grade quartz fiber .",
    "electrons extracted from the photocathode are injected into the gas and drift toward the anode under the action of an externally applied electric field .",
    "the electron current is integrated by an active integrator ( charge sensitive amplifier ) connected to the anode .",
    "typically , a few millions of electrons per pulse are released _ in vacuo_.",
    "the charge sensitive amplifier response is @xmath21mv / fc .",
    "the resulting output voltage signal is recorded and displayed on a digital storage scope .    in order to improve the signal - to - noise ratio ,",
    "the electronic signals of 256 light bursts are averaged together for each electric field strength settings .",
    "the resulting average signal waveform is fetched by a personal computer connected to the scope for offline data processing .",
    "the waveforms are thus analyzed with numerical techniques to determine signal amplitude , hence collected charge , and electron drift time@xcite .",
    "we report the experimental results of the measurements of the charge collected at the anode in dense argon gas in the supercritical region at @xmath0k , quite close to the critical temperature , @xmath22k , and at the much higher temperature @xmath2k .",
    "the two temperatures are sufficiently different so as to result in a 30 % difference in the electron thermal energy . moreover , the lower temperature is close enough to @xmath23 so as to allow us to investigate the electron behavior at very high densities without having to resort to exceedingly high pressures .",
    "actually , a maximum number density @xmath24 has been attained , where the critical density is @xmath25nm@xmath26    experimental data at different temperatures in the one - phase region for @xmath27@xcite and in the supercritical region for @xmath9k@xcite have been previously published .",
    "for all measurements , the electric field @xmath28 is set by the d.c .",
    "power supply in the range @xmath29 at the high end of its range , it is weak enough to avoid breakdown or ionization of the gas . at the low end of the range",
    "we have always checked that contact potential effects are absent by realizing that the measured electron mobility is field independent  @xcite .",
    "it is customary to choose @xmath30 as a parameter to rationalize the data in swarm experiments . actually , the drifting electrons scatter off the gas atoms and the mean energy in excess of thermal gained from the field over a mean free path @xmath31 is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the electron - atom momentum transfer scattering cross section .",
    "thus , for a given ( and constant ) cross section , @xmath30 is proportional to the excess electron energy gained from the field .",

    "is reversed and also the field dependence changes towards a @xmath49-law with @xmath50 and approaching 1 for the highest densities .",
    "it is possible to rule out any space - charge effect as the cause of the observed low - field behavior of @xmath34 because the the amount of charge injected during each light pulse is quite small and because the zero - field electron mobility @xmath51m@xmath52v@xmath53s@xmath54 is large even at the highest densities  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the residual content of o@xmath55 impurities is so small that the concentration of slow o@xmath56 ions is negligible .",

    "the remaining electrons that are not backscattered keep diffusing and lose their excess energy in a huge number of scattering events until they thermalize beyond the potential energy maximum and are collected to the anode  @xcite .    the actual physical situation",

    "nonetheless , the extremely simplified yb model  @xcite does a good job at describing the experimental results of charge collection efficiency in low density gases .",
    "the simplifying assumptions of the model and the results it provides are subject of strong criticism  @xcite but , still , its simplicity is appealing .",
    "we will show that the yb model , if enhanced by the knowledge about multiple scattering effects gathered from the electron mobility measurements in dense noble gases , can still provide a very accurate description of the experimental data .    according to the model ,",
    "an electron is removed from the current stream as soon as it is scattered backwards at such an angle that it can reach the emitter again .",
    "the effect of the image field is neglected but it is clear that it can only ease the process .",
    "the model further assumes that only reflections of the electrons at their first encounter are sufficient to calculate the return current .",

    "<S> injection of photoelectrons into gaseous or liquid dielectrics is a widely used technique to produce cold plasmas in weakly ionized systems for investigating the transport properties of electrons . </S>",
    "<S> we report measurements of the collection efficiency of photoelectrons injected into dense argon gas for @xmath0k , close to the critical temperature @xmath1k , and for @xmath2k . </S>",
    "<S> the high - field data agree with the young - bradbury model and with previous measurements below @xmath3 and at an intermediate temperature above @xmath4 the effective , density - dependent electron - atom momentum transfer scattering cross section can be deduced . </S>",
    "<S> however , the weak - field data near @xmath3 show large deviations from the theoretical model . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the electron behavior at weak field is influenced by electrostriction effects that are only important near the critical point . </S>"
