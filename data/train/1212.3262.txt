    "the first step towards an understanding of a linear field theory is often to examine its fundamental singular solutions .",
    "these serve as elementary components of complicated fields constructed _ via _ linear superposition ; familiar examples abound in electrostatics @xcite and viscous @xcite and inviscid @xcite fluid flows .",
    "there is currently no analogous procedure for generating the shape of an elastic sheet from singularities in its gaussian curvature .",
    "the corresponding field equations are non - linear , and the canonical singularities may be more exotic than points or lines @xcite . yet in a thin sheet , the simplest defects are pointlike and conical , and such a defect bears a strong resemblance to a monopole . the intrinsic geometry of a conical monopole can be characterized completely by an angle @xmath0 .",
    "if we remove a wedge of material ( @xmath1 ) , the only bending equilibrium of an isolated sheet is a circular ice cream cone .",
    "if this deficit is replaced by a surplus ( @xmath2 ) , an infinite number of dihedrally symmetric equilibrium shapes exists @xcite , but the two - fold symmetric state is the only stable one @xcite .",
    "the question of how to construct multipolar analogues of a conical defect is an obvious next step , one that has already been hinted at in the treatment of disclination dipoles as `` dislocations '' in crystalline membranes @xcite .",
    "composite defects can always be constructed by placing additional pointlike defects on the sheet ( fig .",
    "[ fig : art ] ) . when a cardboard box is folded from a flat template , positive gaussian curvature is generated at its eight vertices .",
    "a general defect will consist of a combination of deficits and surpluses .",
    "the simplest composite defect is a dipole .",
    "defects like these can arise during metric - preserving deformations of flat sheets by various types of forcing @xcite or through reconstructive surgery of a surface .",
    "more complicated elastic defects may arise through organismal growth @xcite , chemical swelling @xcite , or the formation of coherent precipitates ( eshelby inclusions ) in crystalline alloys @xcite .",
    "we consider the extrinsic geometry of the analogue of a pure electrostatic dipole , a deficit and a surplus separated by a finite distance , carrying a total gaussian curvature `` charge '' of zero .",
    "the distance , and charges , must be finite as we have already hit a snag in our construction : the classical dipole limit is inaccessible as we are unable to remove an arbitrarily large wedge from a plane .",
    "a greater complication arises from the absence of linear superposition .",
    "it is not generally possible to sew two cones together without introducing stretching somewhere on the surface .",
    "one resolution , which we will use in this article , is to approximate the geometry by two conical parts joined by a ridge , with planar faces on either side interpolating between the cones .",
    "we will begin by describing this geometry .",
    "the energy associated with the sheet is bending energy , quadratic in the mean curvature .",
    "we will ignore the energy associated with the formation of the ridge between the two defects .",
    "we will see that unlikely as this may appear this is legitimate for understanding the broad features of a dipole .",
    "even this simple model displays behavior without any electrostatic analogues .",
    "there are two distinct stable dipole states with different energies , separated by a high energy barrier ; the ground state is quite mechanically rigid .",
    "a simple way to familiarize oneself with the peculiarities of a dipole in an unstretchable sheet is to tinker with a piece of paper @xcite .",
    "take two points near the center of a rectangular sheet and connect them with a line parallel to the longer side . to construct a dipole of strength",
    "@xmath0 , first cut out a wedge with an angle @xmath0 at one of the two points , join the two exposed sides in the sheet , and round off the edges .",
    "then , make a cut from the second point to the boundary , insert the wedge , and round off again .",
    "two different stable shapes are possible ( fig .",
    "[ fig : epoles ] ) : either the two sides extend into two opposite regions of space , or the whole sheet lies beneath the line joining the two points .",
    "the two configurations are stable with respect to small deformations , but can be transformed into one another if significant forces are applied . outside the singularities , the dipole in fig .",
    "[ fig : forcedipole ] resembles the zero - deficit `` developable cone '' obtained , among other ways , by depressing a sheet into a cup with a point force at its center @xcite .",
    "the second dipole , in fig .",
    "[ fig : torquedipole ] , seems to represent the analogous application of a point torque .",
    "accordingly , we will refer to the two configurations as _ force _ and _ torque _ dipoles .    in both cases ,",
    "the surface can be approximated by planar parts which connect a deficit to a surplus cone .",
    "the two planar regions of the torque dipole appear to form triangles extending to the boundary of the sheet .",
    "the two triangles meet along a straight ridge , with dihedral angle @xmath3 , connecting the conical singularities .",
    "the force dipole can be approximated in similar fashion , but one must exercise a little more care : in the paper model , the ridge is not straight , and it is not completely clear how the flat regions can be defined . we will return to this point below . for the theoretical model , we will assume that the dipole consists of a pair of unstretchable cones joined by a straight ridge and planar regions .",
    "the dipole vector @xmath4 points from the deficit singularity to the surplus singularity along the ridge .",
    "this vector , together with the apparent mirror plane of the equilibrium dipole geometries , defines the perpendicular vertical @xmath5 .",
    "to construct the global geometries , we first consider the two conical defects separately .",
    "we will use the subscript @xmath6 in the following only when the distinction between the two cones is relevant .",
    "each of the cones can be described in terms of an open curve @xmath7 on the unit sphere , where the arc length @xmath8 runs from 0 to @xmath9 .",
    "the value of @xmath9 depends on the dipole strength @xmath10 and , implicitly via the coupling between the two cones , on the dihedral angle @xmath3 .",
    "each conical surface is given by the vector function @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the radial distance to the apex .",
    "the two tangent vectors to each cone , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , form a right - handed orthonormal surface basis together with the normal @xmath15 . whereas the surface is flat in the direction of @xmath13 , its curvature along @xmath8 is given by @xmath16 .",
    "the latter corresponds to the geodesic curvature of @xmath17 on the unit sphere and should not be mistaken for the frenet curvature .",
    "we will have to identify the configurations that minimize the bending energy of an open unstretchable cone of radius @xmath18 with surplus or deficit angle .",
    "since tangent vectors and curvatures must be continuous across the boundaries between flat and conical parts , @xmath19 must vanish along two fixed radial lines .",
    "if we cut off the apex at @xmath20 and integrate over the radial direction , the bending energy is given by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 .",
    "the unstretchability of the sheet can be implemented by adding a constraint term to the energy functional which fixes the metric _ via _ a set of lagrange multiplier functions @xmath23 .",
    "these can be identified with a conserved tangential stress @xcite , which for the present case is encoded in a constant @xmath24 . for the conical sheet , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .    for an isolated conical monopole ,",
    "there is a remarkably simple way to determine the shape of such a surface @xcite .",
    "recall that one can find a conserved noether current for every continuous symmetry of a system .",
    "the fixed apex breaks translational invariance of the monopole , but the bending energy remains rotationally invariant .",
    "the corresponding conserved vector @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 .",
    "its square yields the first integral of the shape equation of the monopole : @xmath30 analogous to planar euler _ elastica_. the problem we consider here is more complicated than that of an isolated monopole : the surface is modeled by combining two individual cones , neither of which forms a closed surface .",
    "one might be skeptical as to whether it is correct to appeal to the rotational invariance underlying conservation of the torque vector @xmath28 for each individual cone .",
    "however , we will see below that this yields a valid approximation for the constituent cones of the dipoles .",
    "the interaction between the two cones will occur entirely through boundary conditions .",
    "( [ eq : firstintegral ] ) can be solved for @xmath19 in terms of elliptic functions . since @xmath19 vanishes on the boundaries",

    "in fact , several types of self - contact are possible : @xmath79 the surplus cone can touch the planar regions of the dipole , @xmath80 adjacent folds of the surplus cone can touch each other , @xmath81 when @xmath55 is too small , surplus and deficit cones can touch each other in the force dipole configuration . whereas we can exclude case @xmath81 by assuming that @xmath55 is sufficiently big",

    "the qualitative behaviour of @xmath87 does not depend on @xmath0 : for the torque dipole , the minimum always lies somewhere in the middle of the curve , whereas for the force dipole , it coincides with the upper limit where @xmath92 .",
    "these results help us to understand the behavior of the paper dipole ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : epoles ] ) . we observe that it is simpler to convert a force dipole into a torque dipole than _ vice versa_. in terms of our theory , this can be explained by the difference in energy of the two states : for fixed @xmath0 , the torque dipole always has a lower energy than the force dipole ( see fig .  [",

    "we have assumed that each of these states can be decomposed into two conical singularities joined by flat parts .",
