    "when observations by the spacecraft dawn enabled the first detailed survey of impact craters on the astroid 4 vesta recently , it was noted that the cumulative size - frequency distribution can be approximated by a power - law with ( double logarithmic ) slope @xmath0 for small craters , close to the geometric saturation slope of @xmath1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this approximate inverse square power - law has also been observed on other planetary bodies in the solar system , for example on mars ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . since size - frequency distributions of impact craters",
    "are a powerful tool in planetology to date surfaces and reconstruct planetary evolution ( see , e.g. , @xcite , and the review by @xcite for mars ) , it is important to understand their origin . the first detailed statistical model of impact cratering was given by @xcite in the context of lunar exploration . assuming that craters are circular but",
    "may overlap , are poisson - distributed over the lunar surface subject to a time - dependent production function with probability density @xmath2 for a crater radius to lie in the interval @xmath3 , he showed in a subsequent work that for any @xmath4 , the cumulative frequency of craters larger than radius @xmath5 is indeed approximately proportional to @xmath6 in a steady - state at late times ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , when this state is reached , the distribution of craters is the same for a class of underlying production functions .",
    "moreover , if a population of craters of radius @xmath5 reaches geometric saturation , then its frequency is exactly proportional to @xmath6 because of circle packing on the surface ( cf .",
    "it may also be recalled that power - law distributions are self - similar ( for craters see , e.g. , @xcite , pp . 18f and 34ff ) , but this feature alone does not explain the fairly consistent power of @xmath1 itself .",
    "the universality of this property , then , seems to lend itself naturally to a geometrical explanation . in this article",
    ", we present a new geometrical approach to study crater distribution functions , which is inspired by applications of measures to cosmological models of inflation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while any size - frequency distribution of craters is , in the absence of other resurfacing , the result of the production function which depends on properties of the impactors creating the craters , it is possible that the size - frequency distribution evolves to a steady - state at least partially independent of its creation history , as shown by marcus result . in such a case , one might expect _ a priori _ a uniform distribution over the configuration space of craters . in order to investigate this point",
    ", we shall start in this paper with the assumption of a uniform distribution of craters over their configuration space and show that this implies in fact an inverse square power - law for the size - frequency distribution of small craters .",
    "of course , by contraposition , this means that any deviation from this relationship implies a non - uniformity of the crater distribution over their configuration space , which in turn may have physically interesting implications for the underlying class of production functions .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : desitter ] , we consider the 3-dimensional configuration spaces of circles on the euclidean plane and on the unit sphere , and it turns out that these can be given a de - sitter geometry . by interpreting the configuration space of craters as that of circles and computing its canonical volume measure , we show in sec . [",
    "sec : craters ] how an inverse square power - law for the cumulative size - frequency distribution of small craters emerges .",
    "this model also shows that the global crater distribution is no longer self - similar once crater size becomes comparable to the size of the planetary body .",
    "initially , we shall assume that craters are sparse with negligible overlap in the sense that their area filling factor @xmath7 , corresponding to a small fraction of geometric saturation which has filling factor @xmath8 ( cf .",
    "this appears to be a reasonable assumption , as the observed distribution of craters is typically below 10% of geometric saturation ( e.g. for the moon , see again @xcite who compares it to a  mare exemplum \" created in laboratory experiments ) .",
    "the effect of crater overlap on the distribution function is then considered as well .",
    "the conclusions are in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] , where an interpretation of this result and further applications are suggested .",
    "we begin by showing that the geometry of the configuration spaces of circles on the euclidean plane and on the unit sphere in euclidean space can be regarded as de - sitter spacetimes .",
    "the first case will be seen in sec .",
    "[ sec : plane ] as special case of the configuration spaces of @xmath9-spheres in @xmath10-dimensional euclidean spaces .",
    "the discussion of this more general case will also help to establish the second case in sec .",
    "[ sec : sphere ] .",
    "then , in both cases , one can easily derive the canonical volume measures for these configuration spaces .",
    "the connection with more general sphere geometry is outlined in the appendix .",

    "any such sphere is uniquely defined by its centre at @xmath13 and its radius @xmath14 .",
    "since these are independent of each other , the configuration space of such spheres @xmath15 is @xmath16-dimensional .",
    "the special case @xmath17 corresponds , of course , to circles on the euclidean plane .",
    "we will now see how the configuration space @xmath18 can be interpreted as a @xmath16-dimensional de - sitter spacetime , and this spacetime of constant curvature can be described in the usual way as a quadric hypersurface in @xmath19-dimensional minkowski spacetime @xmath20 with metric @xmath21 .",
    "firstly , one may regard the euclidean space @xmath12 as the intersection of the null cone through the origin in an @xmath19-dimensional minkowski spacetime @xmath20 with a null hypersurface , as follows .",

    "( [ desitter4 ] ) one finds @xmath47 the volume measure of the 3-dimensional configuration space @xmath48 of circles on the euclidean plane .      in view of the application to the distribution of craters on a planetary surface",
    ", we shall proceed by extending the previous case to the configuration space of circles @xmath49 on the 2-dimensional unit sphere @xmath50 centered at the origin of @xmath51 .",
    "each circle is fully characterized by its angular radius @xmath52 and by its centre @xmath53 on the unit 2-sphere in euclidean 3-space , so that @xmath54 and the two spherical coordinates of the centre can be computed in the usual way .",

    "now , for a given circle of angular radius @xmath60 , there is a family of spheres @xmath56 whose intersection with the unit 2-sphere produces this circle .",

    "we take the distribution of craters of radius @xmath60 that are produced to be proportional to @xmath133 .",

    "while a detailed discussion of the properties of eq.s ( [ overlap1])([overlap3 ] ) and the numerical comparison with observed crater distributions is beyond the scope of the present article , we shall use the volterra equation ( [ overlap1 ] ) to illustrate the effect of _ little overlap _ for craters with small lower limit of the angular radius , @xmath155 . by this",
    "we mean a small deviation of @xmath156 from the sparse crater distribution so that the constant in the volterra equation is small , @xmath157 .",
    "then an approximate solution of eq .",
    "( [ overlap1 ] ) for @xmath158 can be expressed naturally as the leading terms of a neumann series expansion of the full solution , @xmath159 whence the first approximation will be given by @xmath160 integrating ( [ overlap4 ] ) in eq .",

    "starting from the assumption that impact craters are uniformly distributed over their de - sitter configuration space , it is shown by eq.s ( [ nu - approx ] ) and ( [ n - approx ] ) that this can indeed explain the approximate inverse square power - law for the cumulative size - frequency distribution of small craters , which is widely observed as noted in the introduction .",
    "moreover , while eq .",
    "( [ n ] ) shows that the global crater distribution is not self - similar , fig .",
    "[ fig : cumul ] illustrates that the deviation from the inverse square power - law due to the finite size of the planetary body is in fact mostly negligible , so that the crater distribution is effectively self - similar .",
    "also , since smaller craters are relatively more affected by overlap , we expect that they are systematically undercounted relative to the distribution of sparse craters with negligible overlap .",
    "this is the case , as indicated by eq .",
    "( [ overlap4 ] ) and the dotted curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : cumul ] for small @xmath60 .",
    "hence , the approach promoted in this article suggests that the de - sitter configuration space may be a useful prior for the study of cratering histories .",
    "deviations from the inverse square power - law correspond to non - uniform distributions of small craters on this configuration space .",
    "we suggest that such deviations from uniformity will indicate physically interesting processes like resurfacing due to igneous activity and erosion , as well as properties of the impactors before a steady - state of the crater population , as in the formalism of marcus mentioned in the introduction , is reached . a first step in this direction would be to classify production functions and resurfacing processes in terms of the deviation of the resulting crater configuration space from this de - sitter geometry , which will depend on time .",
    "hence , comparing these templates with observed maps of crater configuration spaces may yield new insights into cratering histories .",
    "finally , this article notes a perhaps surprising formal connection between the geometry of a cosmological spacetime and a problem in planetology .",
    "recall that the 3-dimensional configuration space of circles , and hence of craters as discussed , was interpreted as the 3-dimensional de - sitter spacetime with the metric given by ( [ desitter6 ] ) and hence the line element , @xmath163 now in order to connect this with the de - sitter spacetime familiar from cosmology , one can use the coordinate transformation @xmath164 so that @xmath165 where @xmath166 takes its usual interpretation as coordinate time . extending our argument from two to three spatial dimensions ,",

    "this may be useful to study the statistics of bubbles in the universe , for instance supernova remnants within the interstellar medium or voids in the large - scale structure .",

    "it turns out that @xmath174 and @xmath175 touch each other respecting orientation if , and only if , ( @xcite , proposition 3.43 ) @xmath176 and this is exactly the reflexive and symmetric contact relation studied in sphere geometry .",
    "moreover , @xmath177 can be equipped with a product defined as @xmath178 letting @xmath179 , we therefore find that @xmath180 measures the infinitesimal deviation of laguerre cycles with respect to the contact relation , and this is seen to define a minkowski metric on @xmath177 .",
    "note that ( [ lagmetric ] ) may be regarded as a line element on @xmath177 which is invariant under transformations of laguerre cycles preserving power ( [ power ] ) .",
