    "the valuation and risk management of annuities are important topics in the actuarial science .",
    "there is a wide variety of contractual annuity payoffs , ranging from fixed payouts to variable annuities , possibly with guaranteed benefits features .",
    "the pricing and valuation of such contracts have been considered in the actuarial literature , under different choices of equity price , mortality and interest rate models @xcite .",
    "most of the theoretical work on variable annuities in the literature is in a continuous - time setting , although in practice these instruments are defined and simulated in discrete time .",
    "we note that discrete time models have been also considered in the actuarial literature @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will work in a discrete time setting , and will compare our results with the continuous time approximation .",
    "we will consider in this paper the case of a fixed payout annuity under the geometric brownian motion model for the equity returns .",
    "the interest rates will be assumed to be constant and deterministic , and the mortality will be described by a geometric distribution .",
    "this setting is of interest both from a theoretical point of view , and as a simple starting point for building more complicated and realistic models .",
    "the geometric brownian motion model for equities prices ( the black - scholes model ) is the simplest model available in the literature .",
    "the lognormal model ( independent lognormal iln ) is also one of the recommended models in the american academy of actuaries report , and is used for generating pre - packaged economic scenarios ( see @xcite , appendix 2 . ) .",
    "this model can be extended by adding stochastic volatility , modeled either as a diffusion or using a regime - switching approach .    under the lognormal returns equity model , the present value of a fixed coupon annuity can be related to the sum of geometric brownian motions ( gbm ) sampled on a discrete time points .",
    "the distributional properties of this quantity , both in a discrete and continuous time setting , have been widely studied in the mathematical finance and actuarial literature , see @xcite for overviews .",
    "consider for example a stochastic annuity which pays a constant coupon @xmath0 at regular times with time step size @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , assume that the payments are made from a portfolio containing an asset with value process @xmath2 which is stochastic and follows a geometric brownian motion : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a standard brownian motion starting from @xmath5 at time @xmath5 , and @xmath6 are real parameters .",
    "@xmath2 represents the value at time @xmath7 of one unit of currency invested at time zero into the asset ( for example stocks ) , which has normally distributed log - returns .",
    "the present value of the annuity , assumed to pay @xmath8 coupons at times @xmath9 , is @xmath10 where @xmath11 are discount factors .",
    "this quantity is a random variable and represents the liability , or amount of currency required at time zero in order to be able to pay the annuity cash flows .",
    "we are interested in the shape of the probability density of @xmath12 , and especially in the tails of this distribution , which give the probabilities of extreme values of the liability represented by the annuity payments .",
    "if the discounting rate @xmath13 is constant and deterministic , the discount factors are exponential @xmath14 and the annuity value @xmath12 is proportional to the sum of a geometric brownian motion sampled on discrete times @xmath9 @xmath15 where we redefined @xmath16 .",
    "a related quantity appears in the problem of pricing asian options with discrete sampling , which are derivatives linked to the average of the price of an asset @xmath17 @xmath18 under the assumption that @xmath17 follows a geometric brownian motion @xmath19 here @xmath20 is a standard brownian motion , and @xmath21 are the volatility and drift of the asset .",
    "if the averaging times are uniformly distributed and the time step is sufficiently small , the time average ( [ avdef ] ) can be approximated by the continuous time average @xmath22 this reduces the problem to the study of the distributional properties of the time integral of the geometric brownian motion , which has been extensively studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "the distributional properties of the time - integral of the geometric brownian motion simplify very much in the infinitely large time limit . define @xmath23",
    "the following result was proven in @xcite , see section 3 in @xcite for a survey of related results .",

    "we study in this paper the distributional properties of the discrete sum of the gbm sampled on uniformly spaced times @xmath32 @xmath33 the sum of the inverse of the gbm ( [ sinv ] ) can be obtained from this by replacing @xmath34 .",
    "we will study the distributional properties of @xmath35 , of the infinite sum of gbm @xmath36 , and of @xmath37 , the sum of gbm with geometrically distributed @xmath38 .",
    "we study the existence of the @xmath39 limit , the tail asymptotics for all three cases , and the moments of the corresponding random variables , and also the convergence of the discrete sums to the continuous time integrals .",
    "the results will then be applied to study annuities and asian options .",
    "we also also illustrate our results numerically .    the problem of determining the distribution of the discrete sum of gbm is closely related to the study of the distribution of the sum of log - normals which has a long history ,",
    "see @xcite for a literature overview .",
    "the simplest approach is to approximate the distribution with a log - normal random variable @xcite .",
    "the tails asymptotics of the sum of correlated log - normals has been studied in @xcite .",
    "dufresne @xcite studied the distribution of the sum ( [ xndiscrete ] ) , generalized by the introduction of an weight function , in the small volatility limit @xmath40 , and derived a limit theorem for this quantity .",
    "milevsky and posner @xcite studied the pricing of asian options with discrete monitoring .",
    "they applied the distributional properties of the infinite time integral of the gbm to the discrete sum @xmath35 , and proposed to use the inverse gamma distribution as an approximation for the finite sum , as a parametric approximation for pricing asian options .",
    "the inverse gamma distribution is obtained only for continuous time ; in discrete time the distribution is different , and we study here the corrections to the approximation of the discrete infinite sum with the continuous time integral .",
    "the present authors @xcite studied the distributional properties of the sum ( [ xndiscrete ] ) in the @xmath39 limit at fixed @xmath41 , and found almost sure limit , fluctuations and large deviations of the average @xmath42 and then obtained the asymptotics for the prices of out - of - the - money , in - the - money and at - the - money asian options . notice that the fixed @xmath43 and @xmath44 limit corresponds to the small maturity or small volatility regimes . for asian options ,",
    "the typical maturity can be @xmath45 year or @xmath46 year and the volatility is usually less than @xmath47 .",
    "thus the small maturity or small volatility regimes are of practical interest in business applications .",
    "the case of fixed @xmath48 and @xmath44 gives the infinite sum of geometric brownian motions @xmath49 .",
    "this situation corresponds to the large maturity or large time - horizon regime , which are of practical interest for stochastic annuities , but less relevant for the pricing of asian options .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ infinitesection ] , we study the properties of the distribution of the infinite sum of a geometric brownian motion . we obtain a stochastic recurrence equation and use it to derive an integral equation for the probability density function of the infinite sum of the geometric brownian motion @xmath50 sampled on a uniformly spaced time grid with time step @xmath1 .",

    ", we show that the infinite sum of geometric brownian motions converges in @xmath52 norm to the infinite integral , which is known to follow an inverse gamma distribution @xcite , see theorem  [ thm : dufresne ] . in section [ geometricsection ] ,",
    "we repeat the analysis for the sum of geometric brownian motions stopped at a geometric stopping time . in the context of the stochastic annuities",
    ", this corresponds to a geometrically distributed mortality time . as the time step goes to zero",
    ", we show that this sum converges in distribution to the continuous time integral of geometric brownian motion with exponentially distributed terminal time , whose properties are well understood in the literature . in section [ levysection ] ,",
    "we extend the results for the sums of geometric brownian motions to the sums of exponential lvy processes , and in section [ sec : positivemoments ] , we derive explicit expressions for the positive moments of the infinite sum of gbm . in section [ applicationsection ]",
