    "over the last several years , there has been a steady increase in the number and quality of observations available for disk galaxies from @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "schade et al .  ( 1995,1996 ) , using early ground and space based images of galaxies from the canada - france redshift survey ( cfrs ) , found a net increase in the surface brightness of galaxies to @xmath3 .",
    "along the same lines , roche et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , compiling 347 galaxies from the medium deep survey and other surveys , concluded that disk galaxies had undergone a net evolution in surface brightness and a net devolution in size .",
    "lilly et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , using structural parameters extracted from hst images of the combined cfrs and ldss2 sample , concluded that there has been essentially no evolution in large disks out to @xmath3 . as a preliminary effort as part of the deep survey , vogt et al .",
    "( 1996,1997 ) found little evolution in the tully - fisher relationship ( @xmath6 ) out to @xmath3 .",
    "more recently , these observations have been augmented by the deep sample with 197 galaxies from the groth strip to @xmath7 , 1.5 magnitudes deeper than the ldss2-cfrs sample . in a first paper , simard et al .",
    "( 1998 ) concluded that there had been little evolution in the disk surface brightness distribution to @xmath3 contrary to previous claims .",
    "a number of different approaches have been proposed for making specific predictions about disk evolution .",
    "mo , mao , & white ( 1998a ) showed how the standard paradigm for hierarchical growth of structure combined with simple assumptions about angular momentum conservation led to simple scaling relationships for the change in disk properties as a function of redshift .",
    "other authors ( ferrini et al .  1994 ; prantzos & aubert 1995 ; prantzos & silk 1998 ; boissier & prantzos 1999 ; chiappini , matteucci & gratton 1997 ) , taking more of a backwards approach to the problem , used detailed studies of the profiles of the milky way and other nearby galaxies to propose radially dependent models of star formation in disk galaxies , models which could be used to make detailed predictions about high - redshift disk evolution .",
    "already there have been a number of elegant studies in which both the backwards approach ( cayn , silk , & charlot 1996 ; bouwens , cayn , & silk 1997 ; roche et al .",
    "1998 ) and the forwards approach ( mao , mo , & white 1998 ; steinmetz & navarro 1999 ; contardo , steinmetz , & fritze - von alvensleben 1998 ; van den bosch 1998 ; mo , mao , & white 1998b ) have been used to interpret the observations available for disk galaxies , mostly to @xmath3 .    unfortunately",
    ", none of these studies considered the important effect that a large spread in surface brightness could have on the interpretation of these observations , particularly the potentially large fraction of low surface brightness galaxies . in some studies ,",
    "the surface brightness selection effects at low and high redshift were simply ignored , and in others , e.g. , roche et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the spread was limited to @xmath8 about freeman s law ( freeman 1970 ) .",
    "clearly , given the apparent large numbers of low surface brightness galaxies seen locally , it is quite logical to wonder if these galaxies are detectable in current high redshift surveys .",
    "indeed , one might wonder whether these galaxies or the observed correlation between luminosity and surface brightness may have already affected the interpretation of high redshift observations . in light of the recent claim by simard et al .",
    "( 1999 ) that the apparent surface brightness evolution thus far inferred to @xmath3 is completely due to surface brightness selection effects , such a study would seem to be especially timely .",
    "secondly , none of these studies directly compared the predictions of the forward and backward approaches using the same observations .",
    "simple comparisons of the scaling expected in surface brightness , size , luminosity , and number are useful for interpreting the high redshift observations .    to address these shortcomings , we shall therefore consider implementations of both approaches , normalize them to the observed @xmath2 size - luminosity relationship , compare their predictions , and consider how each of them fares at explaining the observed disk evolution out to @xmath3 incorporating all the selection effects as they are best understood .",
    "we commence by presenting our models (  2 ) and the observational samples with which we compare (  3 ) .",
    "we present the results (  4 ) , discuss them (  5 ) , and then summarize our conclusions (  6 ) . throughout this study , we use @xmath9 unless otherwise noted .",
    "we begin by sketching the base @xmath4 model to be used for both the models which follow .",
    "we use a set of gaussian lfs based on those presented in binggeli , sandage , and tammann ( 1988 ) : @xmath10 we adjusted the bulge - to - total ( @xmath11 ) distributions of these galaxy types to obtain fair agreement with the de jong & van der kruit ( 1994 ) sample . finally , we adjusted the luminosity function so there was rough agreement with the combined sabc and sdm luminosity functions presented in pozzetti , bruzual , & zamorani ( 1996 ) .",
    "we present our parameterized populations in table 1 .",
    "cccccccc 2.0 & 1.1 & -19.4 & 0.25 & 1.8 + 2.5 & 1.1 & -19.6 & 0.08 & 0.5 + 8.0 & 1.3 & -18.4 & 0.04 & 0.25 + 24.0 & 1.3 & -16.0 & 0.01 & 0.25    for the above luminosity functions , we convert @xmath4 @xmath0-band luminosity to mass using a constant mass - to - light ratio , where the mass of a @xmath12 galaxy is @xmath13 .",
    "we assume a log - normal scatter of 0.3 dex to reproduce the observed tully - fisher scatter though variation in the formation times ( van den bosch 1998 ) and concentration indexes ( avila - reese , firmani , & hernandez 1998 ) certainly play a role .    to translate this mass into a circular velocity and size",
    ", we calculate the time at which the ambient halo formed .",
    "since halos are always accreting more mass and merging with larger halos , there is some ambiguity in defining this , so for simplicity we take it to equal the redshift at which half of the mass in a halo has been assembled .",
    "we determine the distribution of formation times using the procedure outlined in section 2.5.2 of lacey & cole ( 1993 ) .",
    "we take the circular velocity of the halo to be that corresponding to the halo at its formation time using eq .",
    "( 14 ) .",
    "then , given the mass , circular velocity , and luminosity of the @xmath4 disk , we randomly draw the sizes @xmath14 from the following distribution : @xmath15 ^ 2 ) d \\log r_e\\ ] ] where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "we provide a basic observational and theoretical motivation for this scaling in  2.1 .",
    "note that here the surface brightness is proportional to @xmath19 , that the spread in the size distribution is proportional to the spread in the distribution of @xmath20 , and that the scale length ( surface brightness ) of the average @xmath21 galaxy is exactly equal to that predicted by freeman s law .",
    "we assume that the sed of disks and bulges is identical to that of a 10 gyr - old stellar population with an e - folding time of 4.5 gyr and a @xmath22 foreground dust screen , the extinction curve being that of calzetti ( 1997 ) . for simplicity , we assume this sed is constant independent of time .",
    "we use the bruzual & charlot tables from the leitherer et al .",
    "( 1996 ) compilation for this calculation . in the following models , we evolve the size , number , and luminosity of all galaxy types using simple single - valued functions of redshift : @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 for simplicity , we assume similar scalings in the properties of bulges as a function of time .",
    "since the color and luminosity of disks has been shown to be correlated with inclination , it is reasonable to suppose that disks are not transparent .",
    "unfortunately , there is much controversy concerning the degree to which disks are or are not transparent . for better or worse",
    ", we will side - step this controversy and simply adopt the tully & fouqu ( 1985 ) prescription for extinction in the @xmath0 band : @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the inclination of the disk , 0 corresponding to a face - on disk .",
    "we shall assume our model galaxies are always observed at an inclination of @xmath30 and therefore always correct the observations to this inclination for comparison with the models . in the @xmath0 band , this corresponds to an extinction correction of @xmath31 .",
    "the use of simple scaling relationships between the properties of disks and the halos in which they live has provided a relatively successful way of explaining both the internal correlations between disk properties and their evolution to high redshift . in this picture developed by fall & estathiou ( 1980 ) and revived more recently by dalcanton et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and mo et al .",
    "( 1998 ) among others , the bivariate mass and angular momentum distribution nicely translates into a luminosity and surface brightness relationship for disk galaxies , mass translating directly into luminosity and the dimensionless angular momentum translating directly into surface brightness .",
    "this picture has had much success in explaining the internal correlations between size , circular velocity , and mass .",
    "for example , de jong & lacey ( 1999 ) recently showed that the observed local bivariate luminosity - size distribution is nicely fit by this picture , albeit with a slightly smaller scatter in surface brightness than might otherwise be expected .",
    "for constant mass - to - light ratios , the rough @xmath32 relationship for halos provides a relatively natural explanation for the luminosity - circular velocity ( tully - fisher ) relationship ( dalcanton , spergel , & summers 1997a ; mo et al .",
    "1998a ; steinmetz & navarro 1999 ; contardo et al .",
    "finally , the @xmath33 relationship found in galaxy halos is similarly observed in the disk population ( courteau 1997 ) .    on the other hand",
    ", this picture says little , if anything , about how the gas disk evolved over time and therefore what its local properties ( i.e. , spatial variations in the metallicity , color , stellar ages , gas density , etc . ) or global properties ( total gas mass ) are , and therefore comparisons of this sort will depend upon the model adopted , whether it be one of the popular semi - analytic approaches ( cole et al .",
    "1999 , somerville & primack 1998 ) or a full n - body hydrodynamical simulation ( e.g. , contardo et al .",
    "moreover , it is now apparent that the simple scaling model is fundamentally flawed with regard to the implementation of galaxy formation theory as revealed by high resolution numerical simulations ( moore et al . 1999 ; navarro & steinmetz 1999 ; steinmetz & navarro 1999 ) .",
    "since it however is the only detailed model available , it is imperative to fully explore comparisons with data , properly incorporating observational selection effects , in order to establish the correct basis for ultimately refining the model .    for a detailed discussion of this picture , i.e. , the idea that simple scalings in the properties of halos lead to simple scalings in the properties of disks , the reader is referred to mo et al .",
    "( 1998a ) and later papers by the same authors . for the sake of clarity",
    ", we shall review some of this material . in the standard spherical collapse model for an einstein - de sitter universe ,",
    "the density of the collapsed halo is @xmath34 times the critical density of the universe at collapse time ( see also gunn & gott 1972 ; bertschinger 1985 ; cole & lacey 1996 ) , but depends on the density of universe through the parameter @xmath35 .",
    "expressing the result in terms of the super critical density parameter @xmath36 @xmath37 bryan & norman ( 1998 ) found that for @xmath38 , @xmath39 for @xmath40 , @xmath41 where @xmath42 .    using the virial theorem ,",
    "it is possible to write equations to relate the mass , radius , and circular velocity of each halo . as in somerville & primack ( 1998 )",
    ", it can be shown that @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the halo size , @xmath45 is the circular velocity of the halo at @xmath44 , @xmath46 is newton s constant , and @xmath47 using the fact that @xmath48 , we can rewrite this as @xmath49 or @xmath50 similarly , we can now rewrite the halo mass as @xmath51 assuming the matter which settles in the disk to be some fraction @xmath52 of the halo mass and the angular momentum of this settling matter to be some fraction @xmath53 of the halo s angular momentum , a straightforward derivation ( e.g. , mo et al .",
    "1998a ) allows one to obtain @xmath54 for the mass of the disk and @xmath55 for the radius of the disk .",
    "the dimensionless angular momentum parameter @xmath20 is defined as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is angular momentum , @xmath58 is the mass , and @xmath59 is the total energy of the bound system .",
    "there are three relatively simple reasons to go beyond this simple approach .",
    "first , the adiabatic contraction of the halo due to dissipation of baryons towards the halo center will modify the halo profile .",
    "second , numerical simulations show that model halos actually have a navarro , frenk , & white ( 1997 ) profile for the the dark halo rather than the isothermal profile used above . finally , in order to make comparisons back to the observations , it is important to consider the observationally - measured rotational velocities of the disk rather than the rotational velocities of the halo proper .",
    "mo et al .",
    "( 1998a ) have found approximate fitting formulas for the consequent corrections made to the disk radius @xmath60 and the circular velocity at @xmath61 : @xmath62 @xmath63 where approximate fitting functions for @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 are given by @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69^{1/2}}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is the standard halo concentration parameter for the navarro et al .",

    "for simplicity , we use @xmath71 and @xmath72 to convert @xmath45 to @xmath73 in order to compare with the observations .",
    "we do not use eqs .",
    "( 15)-(16 ) for these comparisons .",
    "note that larger values of @xmath52 render disks unstable at relatively faint surface brightnesses and thus have difficulty accounting for freeman law - type surface brightnesses ( freeman 1970 ) .",
    "on the basis of these simple halo scaling relations , the size and mass of disks at any redshift simply scales as @xmath74 , @xmath75 being the redshift at which these high - redshift disks _",

    "we assume that the @xmath4 luminosity function scales in number as a function of @xmath83 in an analogous way to how the @xmath85 halos scale in number . using the press - schechter ( press & schechter 1974 ) mass function",

    "we now provide a theoretical and observational justification for our size - luminosity distribution .",
    "theoretically , in the fall & estathiou ( 1980 ) picture , the spread in surface brightnesses derives from the spread in dimensionless angular momenta for halos .",

    "( 13 - 16 ) that @xmath94 . ignoring the dependence of @xmath95 on the luminosity",

    "in fact , de jong & lacey ( 1998 ) found that the mathewson , ford , & buchhorn ( 1992 ) data set gave a good fit to the following bivariate size - luminosity distribution with similar properties to those predicted above : @xmath98 ^ 2)}\\nonumber\\\\ & & 10^{-0.4*(m - m_{*})(\\alpha+1 ) } \\exp(-10^{-0.4*(m - m _ * ) } ) d \\log r_e dm\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath17 ( converting their sizes and luminosities from @xmath104 to the @xmath105 used here ) .",

    "; van den bosch 1998 ) , we scale up the size of a typical @xmath21 disk galaxy to 6.9 kpc and reduce the spread in dimensionless angular momenta to @xmath17 , as found by de jong & lacey ( 1999 ) in the analysis of the mathewson et al .",
    "( 1992 ) sample .    throughout our analysis",
    ", we shall take the @xmath110 , @xmath111 model as our preferred fiducial hierarchical model because of its better correspondence with the evolution in the number of small disks observed up to @xmath3 ( mao et al .",
    "we evolve the mass - to - light ratio @xmath82 as @xmath112 to reproduce the observed evolution in the tully - fisher relationship ( see  4.2 ) .      instead of trying to determine how the global structural properties of disks evolve based on the corresponding properties of their ambient halos , it is also possible to examine a number of local disk galaxies in great detail and to use detailed models of their observed properties ( gas profiles , stellar profiles , metallicity profiles , current sfr profiles , age - metallicity relationships ) to determine how galaxies might have evolved to high redshift .    there is no consideration of how individual halos might evolve backwards in time in these models , both for simplicity and because of large uncertainties in the local distribution of dark matter .",
    "consequently , while for the forwards approach , the entire evolution of disk properties derives from an evolution of the halo properties , the infall models considered here completely ignore these effects .",
    "conversely , while the forwards approach presented here ignores issues related to the manner in which halo gas is converted into stars , for the infall model , such issues are important .",
    "naturally , given that one always adopts the observed local universe in this approach as known , this approach does not explain in and of itself why the local disk population is as it is .",
    "indeed , it can not since there is no link to the initial conditions . in this view",
    ", for the hierarchical approach , we adopted the local universe we did because it was a natural prediction of the model , and for the infall approach , we adopted it because it agrees with the observations .",
    "we examine such a model for the evolution of local galaxies based upon the prantzos & aubert ( 1995 ) model for the star formation rates , metallicites , stars , and gas content for the milky way disk .",
    "we previously presented this infall model elsewhere ( bouwens et al.1997 ; cayn et al .",
    "1996 ) , and we shall revisit it here .",
    "this model ignores radial inflows for simplicity and takes the star formation rate to be proportional to both the gas surface density ( @xmath113 ) and the reciprocal of the radius @xmath114 , which for a flat rotation curve is proportional to the epicyclic frequency : @xmath115 where @xmath116^{-1}$ ] .",
    "physically , such a star formation rate results if the star formation rate is proportional to the rate at which molecular clouds collide ( wang & silk 1994 ) or the periodic compression rate ( wyse & silk 1989 ) .    for simplicity",
    ", the accretion time scale @xmath117 was taken to be independent of radius since a variation in this time scale is not strongly constrained by the observations ( prantzos & aubert 1995 ) . the spread in hubble types was then naturally taken to arise from a spread in this time scale ( cayn et al .",
    "the equation for the evolution of the gas density is then @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the time from the formation of the disk to the present . integrating these equations yields the result",
    "@xmath120    given the fact that this model derived from only one galaxy , it is difficult to know how to extend its evolutionary predictions to galaxies with different luminosities and surface brightnesses .",
    "one possible means of extending this model to galaxies beyond the milky way involves simply scaling the star formation rates by the differential rotation rate . the change in the star formation rate",
    "would then be proportional to @xmath121 or the typical dynamical time for the disk .",
    "since @xmath122 is roughly proportional to @xmath73 , there would be no large change in the time scales as a function of disk mass or rotational velocity .",
    "accordingly , bouwens et al .",
    "( 1997 ) simply elected to scale everything in size to reproduce all luminosities while conserving surface brightness , which is precisely what we have done here .",
    "to determine the scaling relations for galaxies using the infall approach , we performed the calculation for each galaxy on a series of 30 different rings varying logarithmically in size , where the smallest is a circle with radius 0.2 kpc and the largest is a ring of radius 60 kpc with width 12 kpc as done in bouwens et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and roche et al .",
    "we calculate the evolution in rest - frame @xmath0 band magnitudes by evolving each ring separately to keep track of its gas mass , stellar composition , and metallicity , and we output its colors using the bruzual & charlot instantaneous - burst metallicity - dependent spectral synthesis tables compiled in leitherer et al .",

    "( 1996,1997 ) scaled appropriately so that the courteau data is centered on unevolved scale size of a galaxy at @xmath4 . at face value",
    ", a comparison of the vogt data with the courteau data indicates that there has been size evolution from @xmath4 to @xmath5 as any of the models here would predict ( mao et al .",
    "nevertheless , the lack of a strong trend in redshift across the vogt data - set makes one suspicious that there may be selection effects at work or even systematic errors in the measurements of parameters which may produce the observed differences . in any case",
    ", strong conclusions must await the compilation of a larger high - redshift dataset , where the selection effects have been more carefully quantified .",
    "we also present model scalings of the number , luminosity , and surface brightness expected for @xmath21 galaxies in figure 1 . by construction , the hierarchical models produce more number evolution than the infall models , which involve no evolution in number . except for the infall model based upon the chiappini et al .",
    "( 1997 ) prescription , our `` infall '' model produces similar evolution in luminosity as the hierarchical models to @xmath3",
    ". the infall models also produce less surface brightness evolution than the hierarchical models .",

    "no adjustment of our models was made to obtain agreement with the courteau ( 1997 ) sample , and so this comparison can be considered a self - consistency check on our @xmath4 models .    at",
    "high redshift , sizes for both models are consistent , if not a little larger than the sizes in the vogt et al .",
    "( 1996,1997 ) sample .",
    "one of the most surprising thing about a comparison of the models with the observations is the significant size evolution observed in the lowest redshift bin ( @xmath167 ) relative to the models .",
    "in fact , as discussed in relation to figure 1 , the low redshift ( @xmath167 ) points seem to have undergone more size evolution than the high redshift ( @xmath168 ) points . as the low redshift points are primarily low luminosity galaxies and the high redshift high luminosity galaxies , this could point to some luminosity - dependent evolutionary trend though the numbers are still too small to make any claims toward this end .",
    "as so often in making low - to - high redshift comparisons , freedom in the choice of the @xmath4 no - evolution model can be very important in interpreting the high - redshift results .",
    "in particular , due to the fact that each redshift bin in the simard et al .",
    "( 1999 ) sample contains galaxies of a particular luminosity , significant evolution in disk surface brightness would appear to be present , simply as a result of correlations between luminosity and surface brightness at @xmath4 .",
    "there are also important surface brightness selection effects in constructing the simard et al .",
    "( 1999 ) sample .",
    "we illustrate the importance of these considerations in figure 4 by presenting a no - evolution model , hereafter referred to as our fiducial no - evolution model , identical to our @xmath4 hierarchical and infall models except there is no - evolution in the disk size , number , surface brightness , or luminosity , i.e. , @xmath169 . we also present the surface brightness distributions recovered from a similar no - evolution model differing only in its use of the @xmath165 surface brightness distribution for all luminosities .",
    "we also present the surface brightness distributions recovered both by including a less conservative surface brightness selection @xmath170 ( more resembling the one used by simard et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ) and without including surface brightness ( @xmath171 ) selection at all .",
    "notice the apparent increase in surface brightness for our fiducial model , where @xmath172 , as a function of z relative to our constant surface brightness model .",
    "it is interesting to note that there is an absence of galaxies at surface brightnesses close to the threshold for detection in the simard et al .",
    "( 1999 ) sample .    with these caveats in mind ,",
    "we compare our model @xmath0-band surface brightness distributions with both the low and high redshift observations in figure 5 .",
    "the models seem to be in rough agreement with the surface brightness distribution of the observations . given that model populations increase in @xmath0-band surface brightness by @xmath1 to @xmath3 ( see figure 1 ) , this suggests a similar increase in the surface brightness of disks to @xmath3 .",
    "the models themselves show no large differences . as so often , the uncertainties in the @xmath4 modeling are large enough to preclude detailed discrimination among models , especially given the limited high redshift data sets .    in figures 6 - 7 ,",
    "we plot the observed luminosity - size distributions at low ( de jong & van der kruit 1994 ) and high ( simard et al .",
    "1999 ) redshift and compare them with those obtained for the @xmath173 hierarchical and infall models .",
    "we show a similar comparison of the hierarchical model with the high redshift lilly et al .",
    "( 1998 ) large disk data - set in figure 8 .",
    "we also plot the cumulative size and luminosity distributions along the vertical and horizontal axes , respectively , for both the observations ( histogram ) and the models ( lines ) .",
    "as in figures 4 - 5 , the models predict too many low surface brightness galaxies relative to the observations .",
    "this also results in too many large model galaxies and too many low luminosity model galaxies relative to the observed size and luminosity distributions at intermediate to low luminosities , especially for the lilly et al.(1998 ) large disk sample even with our more conservative surface brightness limit . for large , luminous galaxies",
    ", there is no obvious change in numbers to high redshift .    in figures 6 - 7",
    ", there are also relatively large differences in normalization between the observations and models .",
    "this is apparently the result of large - scale structure ( there are small groups / clusters at @xmath174 and @xmath175 in the groth strip ) .",
    "it is therefore difficult to make extremely quantitative statements about the evolution in the number density of galaxies with specific surface brightnesses , sizes , and luminosities across the redshift intervals surveyed .    nevertheless , the abundance of high surface brightness disk galaxies at high redshifts relative to the model predictions is surely conspicuous and suggests that there has been a significant increase in the number of high surface brightness disk galaxies to @xmath3 as we have already argued in comparing the model and observed surface brightness distributions .",
    "again , shifting the surface brightness distribution toward these high surface brightnesses ( here by the @xmath1 predicted by the models ) is an obvious way of accommodating this increase . of course ,",
    "any argument based on the normalization of specific galaxy populations is subject to considerable uncertainties important when such small contiguous areas are being probed .    to provide a visual comparison between our no - evolution and evolutionary models ,",
    "we include a simulation of a patch of the hdf ( @xmath176 , @xmath177 , and @xmath178 ) in figure 9 using our fiducial no - evolution model ( panel a ) , the @xmath179 hierarchical model ( panel b ) , and the @xmath110,@xmath180 infall model ( panel c ) for comparison with the actual hdf north and south ( panel d ) .",
    "clearly , the lack of high surface brightness galaxies is apparent in the no - evolution model relative to the hdf and even somewhat in the apparent in the @xmath179 hierarchical model relative to the hdf .",
    "of course , our simulations do not include ellipticals or peculiars , so the actual hdf will include more bright objects than the simulations .",
    "there is a real question about a lack of low surface brightness galaxies relative to our predictions , especially as compared to the no - evolution model predictions .",
    "this conclusion is somewhat dependent on the assumed correlation between surface brightness and luminosity as is evident in figure 4 .",
    "this conclusion is also dependent on the selection biases against low surface brightness galaxies not being stronger than those considered here .",
    "there is an extensive literature discussing surface brightness selection biases ( disney 1976 ; allen & shu 1979 ) and various attempts to derive the bivariate luminosity - surface brightness distribution of galaxies ( mcgaugh 1996 ; dalcanton et al .",
    "1997b ; sprayberry et al.1997 ) .",
    "surface brightness has a particularly strong effect on isophotal magnitude determinations , especially for low surface brightness galaxies ; and this can introduce significant errors in the magnitude determinations , so the effective volume probed for these galaxies is significantly smaller than it is for equivalent luminosity high surface brightness galaxies ( mcgaugh 1996 ) .",
    "simard et al .  ( 1999 ) in a detailed quantification of the selection effects of the deep sample do not consider the effect of surface brightness on the magnitudes and sizes recovered since typical errors were found to be @xmath181 ( simard 1999 , private communication ) . despite the relatively small size of this error , it is not entirely clear to the present authors that the errors would not become quite significant for the lowest surface brightness galaxies in the sample , particularly those just marginally detectable given the chosen object identification and photometric parameters . secondly , simard et al.(1999 )",
    "considers disk galaxies to be optically thin whereas the observations of lilly et al .",
    "( 1998 ) are more consistent with disks being optically thick .",
    "highly - inclined optically thin disks would be much more detectable than face - on or optically - thick disks .",
    "the upshot is that at many apparent magnitudes and radii , simard et al.(1998 ) would suppose that at least some highly inclined galaxies would be detectable and therefore the selection function @xmath171 there would be non - zero when in reality if disks were optically thick it would be zero . for these reasons",
    ", we used a slightly more conservative selection function in surface brightness than that given in figure 4 of simard et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ( see  3.2 ) .",
    "another possibility , not considered here , is that low surface brightness galaxies might form relatively late , meaning that their mass - to - light ratios remain relatively large until relatively recent epochs . of course",
    ", prima facie , this would seem unlikely given the apparently constant slope in the tully - fisher relationship to faint magnitudes .    in their own analysis of their sample of @xmath141 galaxies , simard et al .",
    "( 1999 ) concluded that there had been little evolution in the surface brightness distribution of disk galaxies when all selection effects had been carefully considered , quite in contrast to our estimated @xmath1 of @xmath0-band surface brightness evolution .",

    "numbers _ of high surface brightness galaxies . here",

    "our interpretation seems to be furthermore supported by the lack of low surface brightness galaxies relative to our models . for no - evolution in the disk surface brightness distribution really to be present as simard et al .",
    "( 1999 ) claims , high - redshift intervals should have similar numbers of low surface brightness galaxies to those found in local samples , and these galaxies seem to be deficient , even with respect to our models which show significant evolution in surface brightness .",
    "while the conclusions of simard et al .",
    "( 1999 ) appear to have been carefully drawn , we would like to suggest that there are significant uncertainties in their determination of the mean surface brightnesses in the lowest redshift intervals and therefore the inferred evolution in surface brightness due to the small size of the low redshift samples considered . by applying the selection effects from the high - redshift bin identically to all redshift intervals , simard et al .  ( 1999 ) restricted their analysis to that fraction of disk galaxies exceeding the high - redshift surface brightness detection limit . applying these selection criteria uniformly to all low redshift intervals",

    "<S> we present simple models for disk evolution based on two different approaches : a forward approach based on predictions generic to hierarchical models for structure formation ( e.g. , mo , mao , & white 1998 ) and a backwards approach based on detailed modeling of the milky way galaxy ( e.g. , bouwens , cayn , & silk 1997 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we normalize these models to local observations and predict high - redshift luminosities , sizes , circular velocities , and surface brightnesses . both approaches yield somewhat similar predictions for size , surface brightness , and luminosity evolution though they clearly differ in the amount of number evolution . </S>",
    "<S> these predictions seem to be broadly consistent with the high - redshift observations of simard et al.(1999 ) , suggesting that the @xmath0-band surface brightness of disks has indeed evolved by @xmath1 from @xmath2 to @xmath3 similar to the models and is not an artifact of selection effects as previously claimed . </S>",
    "<S> we also find a lack of low surface brightness galaxies in several high redshift samples relative to model predictions based on local samples ( de jong & van der kruit 1994 ; mathewson , ford , & buchhorn 1992 ) .    </S>"
