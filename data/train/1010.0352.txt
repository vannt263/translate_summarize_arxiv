    "we will first consider propagation of electromagnetic waves in a homogeneous anisotropic medium , then refraction at the interface between anisotropic and isotropic media , and after that discuss reflection and transmission of an anisotropic plain plate of finite thickness .",
    "time to time along the text we make digression to isotropic media , because on one side it helps to check correctness of our formulas , and on the other side it is useful , because isotropic media also represent some difficulties .    of course , some our formulas look huge , but we do nt care about it .",
    "we do not even derive some formulas and leave it to those who will need it .",
    "in fact , it is sufficient to know how to derive them , and if necessary to use a computer .",
