    "extreme value statistics ( evs ) of random walks ( rws )  and their continuous counterpart , brownian motion  has recently attracted much attention ( for recent short reviews see @xcite ) . on the one hand , it has indeed been realized that rws provide a very interesting laboratory to test and characterize the effects of strong correlations between the walker positions at different times on evs quantitatively , about which very little is known ( unlike the uncorrelated case of independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "random variables @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", it was shown that evs of rws have several interesting applications in statistical physics ( e.g. to disordered systems @xcite , fluctuating interfaces @xcite or @xmath7 noise @xcite ) , finance ( e.g. in optimal portfolio strategy @xcite ) , computer science ( e.g. in data storage analysis @xcite or in the statistics of tree structures @xcite ) or even in random geometry in two - dimensions ( e.g. for the convex hull of two - dimensional stochastic processes @xcite or in random convex geometry @xcite ) .",
    "although in many cases the considered rws consist of unbounded random jumps ( e.g. gaussian or @xmath8-stable distributed jumps ) , rws with bounded jumps have also interesting applications like , for instance , in a well studied packing problem in two dimensions where @xmath0 rectangles of variable sizes are packed in a semi - infinite strip of width one .",
    "in this case , it can be shown that the fluctuations of the height of the optimal packing are given by the maximum of a rw whose random jumps are bounded and uniformly distributed over the interval @xmath9 $ ] ( see refs .",
    "more generally , lots of real world random walks are expected to have bounded jumps because of natural limitations inherent in the underlying physics and , in this respect , it is useful to get a good understanding of this case .",
    "although these applications concern the _ global _ maximum of the rw , one may also wonder about the statistics of the second , third , @xmath10 , more generally of the @xmath11-th maximum @xmath12 of a rw ( @xmath13 being just the global maximum ) .",
    "this is known under the name of ` order statistics ' which was recently studied for rws @xcite as well as for more general stochastic processes , like branching brownian motion @xcite , or @xmath7 noise @xcite .",
    "interestingly , these works demonstrated that the order statistics of strongly correlated variables have a very rich structure , much richer than their i.i.d .",
    "more recently , we investigated the statistics of the first gap @xmath14 as well as the time elapsed between the first two maxima , both for discrete time rws @xcite and continuous time random walks ( ctrws ) @xcite .",
    "quite remarkably , we found that the behavior of the joint probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the gap and the time is very sensitive to the distribution of the jumps defining the rw .",
    "our previous investigations covered a wide range of jumps distributions but ignored the important case of _ bounded _ distributions , which is the subject of the present work completing our earlier ones on the complementary case of unbounded jumps  @xcite .",
    "this paper deals with the statistics of the gap and time interval between the first two maxima of long random walks with _ bounded _",
    "one of the motivations for this work has been to investigate the ` concentration ' phenomenon observed and studied in  @xcite for unbounded jumps with distributions going to zero fast enough at infinity ( what we called ` fast decreasing jump distribution ' ) . for such fast decreasing distributions a large gap is more likely to be achieved over two successive jumps instead of over a longer walk between the first two maxima . as we will see in the following , ( i ) the conjecture made in  @xcite that a similar concentration should exist for jump distributions with a bounded support was correct , and ( ii ) there are interesting , non trivial , differences between the bounded jump problem and the fast decreasing jump distribution problem of  @xcite .    in this paper , we consider a random walk starting at the origin , @xmath15 , and evolving according to @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the walker position between the @xmath18-th and the @xmath19-th jumps .",
    "the jumps @xmath20 s are i.i.d .",
    "random variables distributed following a symmetric , bounded and piecewise continuous distribution @xmath21 with a bounded support @xmath22 ( with fixed @xmath23 ) , the fourier transform of which , @xmath24 , has the small @xmath11 behavior @xmath25 with @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the variance of the jump distribution .",
    "let @xmath28 denote the time interval between the @xmath29-th and the @xmath18-th jumps ( @xmath30 ) . in the case of discrete time",
    "random walks one simply has @xmath31 , while for continuous time random walks the @xmath28 s are i.i.d .",
    "continuous random variables , independent of @xmath20 , with pdf @xmath32 the laplace transform of which , @xmath33 , has the small @xmath34 behavior @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the characteristic time scale of the jumps . for @xmath38 , the mean time between two successive jumps , @xmath39 , exists and @xmath40 . for @xmath41 , the mean time between two successive jumps does not exist .",
    "our approach to the problem for long random walks is based on the result , proved in  @xcite , that the joint pdf @xmath42 of the gap @xmath43 and the number of jumps @xmath44 between the first two maxima of the sequence @xmath45 ( i.e. a random walk of @xmath0 jumps ) has a well defined limiting pdf as @xmath46 .",
    "more specifically , one has @xmath47 where @xmath48 is given by its generating function with respect to @xmath44 , @xmath49 with @xmath50 where the upper bound at @xmath51 results from the bounded support of @xmath21 , @xmath22 ( with fixed @xmath23 ) . in eq .",

    "namely , replacing @xmath42 with @xmath57 , the joint pdf of the gap @xmath43 and the time interval @xmath58 between the first two maxima of the sequence @xmath45 , it is not difficult to show that @xmath57 has a well defined limiting pdf too as @xmath46 .",
    "one finds ( see  @xcite for details ) , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is given by its laplace transform with respect to @xmath58 in terms of @xmath61 and @xmath62 , @xmath63 equations  ( [ def_gf ] ) and  ( [ def_lt ] ) are the starting points of our study in the cases of discrete and continuous time , respectively .    before entering the details of the calculations , it is useful to summarize our main results . we first show that for a discrete time random walk , @xmath44 concentrates onto @xmath64 as @xmath65 , the largest possible gap , in the sense that for all @xmath66 , @xmath67 as @xmath65 . in the very wide class of jump distributions @xmath21 behaving algebraically as @xmath68 ( or discontinuous to zero at @xmath69 , see the remark below eq .",

    "this study is the existence of a scaling form for @xmath60 when @xmath41 and for algebraic @xmath21 near @xmath74 .",
    "more specifically , we show that there is a scaling regime @xmath75 with fixed @xmath76 , in which @xmath60 takes the scaling form @xmath77 where @xmath78 with the asymptotic behaviors @xmath79 the amplitudes @xmath80 and @xmath81 are given in eqs .",
    "( [ def_d1 ] ) and  ( [ def_d2 ] ) , respectively .",
    "physically , the switch from the first to the second behavior  ( [ scaling1c ] ) around @xmath82 corresponds to the cross - over from a ` concentration '  or ` one - jump '  regime ( for @xmath83 ) where the walker gets stuck for a long time @xmath58 at the second maximum and then jumps directly to the first maximum , to a ` many - jumps ' regime ( for @xmath84 ) where she / he travels a long walk of total duration @xmath58 ( with many steps ) between the second and the first maxima . for @xmath38 , or non algebraic @xmath21 near @xmath74 , there is no scaling form and  ( [ scaling1a ] ) is replaced with the uniform expression  ( [ eq3.8 ] ) from which it is possible to determine the domains in the @xmath85 plane corresponding to ` one - jump '  and ` many - jumps ' regimes in this case too .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",

    "practically , this means that a large gap , close to its largest possible value , is expected to be mainly due to configurations with adjacent first and second maxima . to prove that this is actually the case",

    "<S> we show that for large @xmath0 ( or large time @xmath1 for ctrw ) , this joint pdf reaches a stationary joint distribution which exhibits an interesting concentration effect in the sense that a gap close to its maximum possible value , @xmath6 , is much more likely to be achieved by two successive jumps rather than by a long walk between the first two maxima . </S>",
