    "a key question in ongoing extragalactic research is to understand to what extent galaxy properties are determined by initial conditions ( nature ) or driven by environmental effects ( nurture ) .",
    "observations in the last few decades have revealed that the evolution of galaxies is indeed strongly dependent on their environment .",
    "in fact , most galaxies are not isolated , but found in gravitationally bound aggregates , such as groups or clusters @xcite .",
    "hence , to fully understand galaxy evolution and assess the relative importance of nature vs.nurture , it is essential to investigate the various physical processes in these different environments modifying galaxy properties such as star - formation rate ( sfr ) , morphology , kinematics and color . in this context ,",
    "compact groups of galaxies provide an ideal laboratory to study the effects of galaxy - galaxy interactions on the evolution of individual group members .",
    "@xcite defined a catalogue of 100 compact groups ( hereafter hickson compact groups , hcgs ) with 451 galaxies in total . although some galaxies in this sample turned out to be chance projections along the line - of - sight , not physically bound to the corresponding group ,",
    "the @xcite sample is still the most detailed studied sample of compact groups in the literature due to the vicinity of member galaxies at a median distance of @xmath4mpc @xcite .",
    "the comparatively low velocity dispersions in the order of @xmath5 km s@xmath6 and the high spatial density with a median projected galaxy separation of only @xmath7kpc @xcite make hcgs the perfect targets to investigate ongoing galaxy transformations due to galaxy - galaxy interactions . based on their high spatial density and low velocity dispersions , crossing times for hcgs are short ( @xmath8 ; @xcite ) making their mere existence puzzling .",
    "in fact , dark matter simulations have shown that hcgs should merge into a single massive galaxy within a gyr @xcite , being possibly the precursor of so - called fossil groups .",
    "one explanation for the existence of hcgs is that they have just recently formed and started to interact on short timescales .",
    "@xcite studied the morphology of galaxies in 92 hcgs with at least three accordant members and found that 43% of all galaxies in their sample show morphological or kinematical distortions indicative of interations or mergers while @xcite noted that the spiral fraction in hcgs is a factor of two lower than in field galaxies .",
    "these observations hint towards a scenario where galaxies in compact groups undergo frequent interactions and mergers , depleting late - type galaxies while building up a higher early - type fraction instead . during this very dynamic stage",
    "it is possible to study the impact of the high density environment on the evolution of the individual group members , which is not yet fully understood .",
    "while interactions in galaxy pairs typically increase the sfr , e.g.   due to a compressing tidal field @xcite , no statistically significant increase in the specific star - formation rates ( ssfr ) of galaxies in hcgs has been found @xcite .",
    "a possible explanation for the reduced sfr in hcgs is efficient gas stripping through ongoing tidal interactions , a process that is typical for the compact group environment .",
    "it has been shown that other possible mechanisms to suppress or even quench star - formation in hcgs are shocks and turbulence @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied a sample of 74 galaxies in 23 hickson compact groups ( hcgs ) and find evidence for enhanced warm h@xmath9 emission in @xmath10% of these galaxies , most of which lie in the optical green valley between the blue cloud and red sequence .",
    "this emission has been associated with the dissipation of mechanical energy caused by a large - scale shock , induced when one group member collides at high velocity with tidal debris in the intragroup medium .",
    "hence , shock excitation or turbulent heating are likely responsible for the enhanced h@xmath9 emission in compact group galaxies and the suppression of star - formation .",
    "other sources of heating like uv or x - ray excitation from star - formation or agn activity are insufficient to account for the observed emission .",
    "@xcite found a mean hi deficiency of 40 % for 48 hcgs and noted that groups with a higher early - type fraction or more compact systems with larger velocity dispersions tend to be more hi deficient .",
    "@xcite studied 9 hcgs in x - rays and have shown that hcgs with a higher x - ray luminosity show a lower ssfr .",
    "these observations suggest an evolutionary scenario where the amount of detected hi in galaxies , and hence the ssfr , decreases with evolution by continuous tidal stripping and/or gas heating to x - ray wavelengths .",
    "these distortions should also be reflected in the observed h@xmath0 profiles of the galaxy disks , which are expected to be truncated based on the frequent interactions . besides the distortion of gas disks within the galaxies",
    ", the ongoing interactions can also efficiently remove gas from its host galaxies , forming long filamentary structures and bridges @xcite .",
    "these arms can become the birthplace of a new generation of actively star - forming star clusters and so - called tidal dwarf galaxies ( tdgs ; see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite listed 47 tdg candidates in 15 tidal features within hcgs and @xcite showed that the faint end of the luminosity function is indeed enhanced in hcgs , possibly due to the efficient formation of tdgs . in this work we continue these studies and investigate the spatial distribution of ongoing star - formation in a sample of 7 hcgs in the southern hemisphere by performing deep h@xmath0 imaging with the 4.1 m soar telescope .",
    "specifically we compare the integrated sfrs of group members with the main sequence of star - forming galaxies and analyze the azimuthally - averaged h@xmath0 surface brightness profiles of the interacting galaxies . by comparing these profiles with the corresponding surface brightness profiles of the stellar component",
    ", we can reveal any distortions in the gas component of the galaxies caused by environmental effects such as tidal stripping .",
    "the deep observations also allow us to detect actively star - forming tdg candidates within the tidal tails of the interacting galaxies . for two groups in our sample , hcg26 and",
    "hcg96 , we compare our h@xmath0 maps with the work of @xcite , who claim to detect new tdg candidates in these systems based on deep @xmath3 band images . all groups in our sample",
    "have been selected based on their recession velocities ( @xmath11 km s@xmath6 ) and morphological appearance , i.e.  all groups show strong interactions between their brightest galaxies .",

    "also the group membership of the sb spiral hcg04b is doubtful , since it shows a relative radial velocity of 1074 km s@xmath6 with respect to the brightest group member .",
    "peculiar velocities of this magnitude are rather expected in galaxy clusters than groups .",
    "the group is dominated by a face - on sc spiral galaxy ( hcg04a ) showing two well - defined spiral arms with attached tails exhibiting several knots in h@xmath0 .",

    "we find 2 objects in the @xmath2 band which are clearly offset from the spiral pattern but do nt detect any h@xmath0 or uv emission for these objects , indicating that these are likely background galaxies .",
    "the perturbed spiral arms in hcg04a are signs of a previous galaxy interaction process . in case",
    "the interaction partner was another group member of hcg04 , the perturbation was either createdby a high - speed encounter of hcg04b , or by a slower and more continuous interaction with hcg04d . @xcite measured emission line ratios in the group member galaxies and classified hcg04d as star - forming , while hcg04a and hcg04b were classified as transition objects between star - forming galaxies and agns .",
    "detailed kinematic data of hcg04a together with galaxy interaction simulation with the known properties of hcg04a , b , and d will reveal which galaxy interaction can reproduce the observed perturbation features .",
    "another option could be that a former interaction partner was fully disrupted and has already merged with hcg04a , leaving behind the observed tidal tails .",
    " @xcite lists 5 bright galaxies in this system .",
    "a tidal tail extending from hcg24b towards the east indicates recent interaction .",

    "hcg25b has also been observed spectroscopically with sdss and given its [ nii]/h@xmath0 emission line ratio it can be considered as agn .",
    "however , @xcite state that agn activity is unlikely to be responsible for the observed h@xmath30 enhancement and that shock excitation through interaction with the igm is a plausible mechanism for producing the observed emission . in the @xmath1@xmath16@xmath2 color map",

    "we do nt see any h@xmath0 emission in the bridge filaments above the detection limit indicating that the bridge does nt show any sf activity .",

    "<S> we present deep h@xmath0 imaging of seven hickson compact groups ( hcgs ) using the 4.1 m southern astrophysics research ( soar ) telescope . </S>",
    "<S> the high spatial resolution of the observations allow us to study both the integrated star - formation properties of the main galaxies as well as the 2d distribution of star - forming knots in the faint tidal arms that form during interactions between the individual galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we derive star - formation rates and stellar masses for group members and discuss their position relative to the main sequence of star - forming galaxies . despite the existence of tidal features within the galaxy groups , </S>",
    "<S> we do not find any indication for enhanced star - formation in the selected sample of hcgs . </S>",
    "<S> we study azimuthally averaged h@xmath0 profiles of the galaxy disks and compare them with the @xmath1 and @xmath2 surface brightness profiles . </S>",
    "<S> we do not find any truncated galaxy disks but reveal that more massive galaxies show a higher light concentration in h@xmath0 than less massive ones . </S>",
    "<S> we also see that galaxies that show a high light concentration in @xmath2 , show a systematic higher light concentration in h@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> tdg candidates have been previously detected in @xmath3-band images for 2 groups in our sample but we find that most of them are likely background objects as they do not show any emission in h@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we present a new tidal dwarf galaxy ( tdg ) candidate at the tip of the tidal tail in hcg 91 .    </S>",
