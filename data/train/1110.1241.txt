    "when media exhibiting low - energy fluctuations are confined by walls or interfaces , or macroscopic objects are immersed in them , their fluctuation spectrum changes @xcite .",
    "this may induce long - range effective forces between such objects and boundaries .",
    "a much studied example of such fluctuation - induced forces are the casimir forces between a pair of parallel and grounded metallic plates produced by their influence on the quantum vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "these quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) casimir forces are known to be very weak unless the separation of the bodies between which they act becomes very small .",
    "the latter condition is met in micro - electromechanical devices ( mems ) . as has recently become clear , casimir forces of this kind",
    "must be taken into account in the design of such systems .",
    "since they tend to be attractive for simple geometries , they may impair the functioning of mems , causing stiction @xcite .",
    "owing to the interest in  and technological importance of  such small - scale systems , this insight has triggered considerable new activity in the study of qed casimir forces .",
    "crucial issues are the knowledge and control of their strength , sign , and geometry dependence @xcite .",
    "another example of fluctuation - induced forces that has attracted a great deal of attention recently are the so - called thermodynamic casimir force caused by thermal fluctuations near critical points @xcite . predicted decades ago @xcite , they were verified experimentally first in an indirect way through the thinning of @xmath26he wetting layers near the lambda transition @xcite and their effects on wetting films of binary liquid mixtures @xcite .",
    "subsequently they were measured directly in binary fluid mixtures near their critical points of demixing @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we shall be concerned with thermodynamic casimir forces in systems with a film geometry bounded by two planar free surfaces at a finite distance @xmath6 .",
    "we will consider systems that can be modelled by an @xmath27-component @xmath28 hamiltonian on sufficiently long length scales and study the casimir forces directly at the bulk critical point .",
    "the internal @xmath0 symmetry ( or @xmath29 symmetry if @xmath30 ) is presumed to be neither explicitly broken by surface contributions to the hamiltonian nor spontaneously for all temperatures @xmath31 , the bulk critical temperature . in other words ,",
    "no ordered phase can occur for finite @xmath6 when @xmath31 . choosing a generic kind of such non - symmetry - breaking conditions",
    ", we will investigate the critical casimir forces and demonstrate two important features of them .",
    "first , they can have either sign , depending on properties of the two surfaces  an expected result since attractive and repulsive critical casimir forces were found a long time ago for certain boundary conditions that ought to apply on long length scales @xcite .",
    "second , for appropriate surface properties , crossovers from attraction to repulsion of the casimir forces and vice versa can occur as a function of film thickness @xmath6 .",
    "a brief account of parts of our work was given in @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to provide details of the calculations and further results .",
    "one motivation for our work is the obvious potential for cross - fertilisation between the fields of thermodynamic and qed casimir effects .",
    "since both types of effects share a number of characteristic features , mutual benefits may be expected . on the other hand",
    ", one must be aware of certain essential differences .",
    "common to both types is that they exhibit universal properties and depend on gross properties of the fluctuating media and confining objects , as well as on their shapes and geometry .",
    "two important differences are :    1 .",
    "when studying qed casimir forces , one frequently gets away with the analysis of effective _ gaussian _ theories in which the coupling between the electromagnetic field and matter is accounted for by proper choices of boundary conditions .",
    "this usually holds even in the case of polarisable and magnetisable media where material properties also enter via dielectric and permeability functions .",
    "by contrast , adequate treatment of critical casimir forces normally involve the study of non - gaussian theories such as @xmath1 theories or corresponding lattice models ( e.g. , ising models ) in bounded geometries .",
    "2 .   in studies of qed casimir forces such as casimir s original work @xcite ,",
    "the electromagnetic fields are taken to have zero averages . hence the casimir forces are entirely due to fluctuations",
    " if there were no fluctuations , there would be no casimir force .",
    "however , in the case of thermodynamic casimir forces , the order - parameter densities @xmath32 have nonzero averages in ordered phases , where the order may either result from spontaneous symmetry breaking or else be imposed by symmetry - breaking bulk or boundary fields .",
    "if the medium undergoes a phase transition from a disordered high - temperature to an ordered low - temperature phase , then the order - parameter profile @xmath33 does not vanish in the latter .",
    "such a nontrivial profile contributes to the size - dependent part of the free energy and hence , to the casimir force .",
    "consequently , a casimir force will be obtained already at the level of landau theory  i.e. , in the absence of fluctuations  whenever it yields non - vanishing order - parameter profiles .",
    "beyond landau theory , the thermodynamic casimir force will therefore consist of a part coming from a non - fluctuating background and a superimposed fluctuation - induced contribution .",
    "the last statement applies in particular to confined binary fluid mixtures @xcite .",
    "these are known to generically involve symmetry - breaking boundary fields .",
    "therefore , the thermodynamic casimir forces they yield will normally have contributions from non - fluctuating backgrounds _ on either side of the order - disorder transitions_. since even at the bulk critical temperature , @xmath33 is not expected to vanish , this holds there as well .",
    "it is well known that the boundary fields needed to describe binary fluid mixtures in contact with walls can have either sign , depending on which one of the two components gets preferentially adsorbed locally at the wall @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there is clear evidence based on theoretical and experimental work as well as on monte carlo simulations @xcite that the critical casimir force in binary fluid mixtures confined between two planar walls can be attractive or repulsive .",
    "corresponding crossovers must occur and were investigated at the level of mean - field theory @xcite .",
    "casimir forces in binary fluid mixtures are particularly well suited for direct experimental measurements . however , from our above remarks it is clear that their analogy with qed casimir forces is limited : owing to the generic presence of a non - vanishing order parameter profile at , above and below the critical temperature , only a part of them is fluctuation induced .",
    "since we focus here on the case in which the symmetry @xmath34 remains unbroken at @xmath35 , we are dealing with critical casimir forces that are entirely fluctuation induced and hence are more akin to qed casimir forces , albeit due to thermal , rather than quantum , fluctuations .",
    "the rest of this paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : ham ] the model is specified and the boundary conditions are recapitulated .",
    "next , the free propagator is determined in section  [ sec : freeprop ] for general values of the surface interaction constants , its eigenfunction representation is given and the transcendental equations derived whose solutions yield its eigenvalues . in section  [ sec : cumren ] , many - point cumulant functions are introduced , their renormalization recapitulated and their rg equations presented .",
    "these considerations are extended to the free energy and casimir force in section  [ sec : freeen ] . in the remainder of this section details of our approach",
    "are explained and our analytical results for the scaling functions of the @xmath6-dependent part of the free - energy density and the casimir force are given . in section  [ sec : consistency ]",
    "it is shown how rg - improved perturbation theory can be reorganised to achieve consistency with the fractional series expansions in @xmath36 one encounters in the special case of two critically enhanced surface planes .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] discusses our results , deals with the issue of how to extrapolate them to @xmath19 dimensions and presents such extrapolation results for the scaling functions of the @xmath6-dependent part of the excess free - energy density and the casimir force .",

    ". finally , there are 5 appendices describing various calculational details .",
    "we consider a continuum model for a real - valued @xmath27-component order - parameter field @xmath37 defined on the @xmath2-dimensional slab @xmath38 $ ] .",
    "we write the position vector as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 denotes the @xmath41 cartesian coordinates @xmath42 along the slab and @xmath43 the remaining one across it .",
    "the thickness of the slab , @xmath6 , is taken to be finite .",
    "we choose periodic boundary conditions along all @xmath44-directions so that the boundary @xmath45 of @xmath46 consists of a pair of ( @xmath41)-dimensional planes @xmath47 and @xmath48 at @xmath49 and @xmath50 . assuming the absence of long - range interactions",
    ", we can choose the hamiltonian to have the local form @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are local bulk and surface densities depending on @xmath32 and its derivatives .",
    "in accordance with our considerations in the introduction we choose these densities to be @xmath0 symmetric . for the bulk density",
    "we make the standard choice @xmath54 ^ 2+\\frac{\\mathring\\tau}{2}\\bm{\\phi}^2(\\bm{x})+\\frac{\\mathring{u}}{4!}|\\bm{\\phi}^2(\\bm{x})|^2\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the usual short - hand for @xmath56 .",
    "it has recently been emphasised that lattice systems lacking cubic symmetry , such as systems involving monoclinic or triclinic lattices , lead to @xmath1 bulk densities with a gradient - square term of the generalised form @xmath57 where @xmath58 stands for the derivative @xmath59 and @xmath60 is a non - diagonal , position - independent matrix @xcite .",
    "we refrain from working with such generalised models because the matrix @xmath60 is nothing but a constant metric @xcite .",

    "the transitions that occur at @xmath65 in such semi - infinite systems are called ordinary , special and extraordinary , depending on whether the enhancement @xmath67 is subcritical ( @xmath68 ) , critical ( @xmath69 ) or supercritical ( @xmath70 ) .",

    "we get the boundary conditions of landau theory @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the inner normal derivative on @xmath76 . beyond landau theory",
    "these boundary conditions still hold in an operator sense ( inside of averages ) @xcite .",
    "a quantity of central importance for the renormalization - group ( rg ) improved perturbation theory we are going to use below is the free propagator @xmath77 at @xmath78 .",
