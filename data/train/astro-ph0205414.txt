    "sn  2002ap was discovered in the nearby spiral galaxy m74 ( @xmath7 ngc 628 ) on 29 january 2002 @xcite and reached its maximum of @xmath8 mag on february 8 @xcite .",
    "it has been classified as a type  ic supernova ( sn  ic ) and suggested to be a hypernova ( but at the low - energy end of the sequence of hypernovae ; @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a sn ic is thought to be the result of the core collapse of a massive star that has either lost its hydrogen and helium envelopes prior to the explosion or has an invisible helium envelope due to low excitation .",
    "the details of the explosion mechanism are still under discussion ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "sn 1998bw , the most luminous and energetic type ic ` hypernova ' to date , has been particularly well studied , and its probable connection with the @xmath9-ray burst grb 980425 has been pointed out ( e.g. , @xcite ) . an aspherical hyperenergetic explosion has been suggested to explain the slowly - declining light curve of sn 1998bw and the narrowness of the [ ] @xmath106300 , 6363 emission line in the nebular phase @xcite .",
    "intrinsic polarization is zero for sne ( which are unresolved sources ) if they are spherically symmetric : any intrinsic polarization thus reveals asymmetry .",
    "core - collapse supernovae are , in fact , generally polarized in the continuum at levels of @xmath11@xmath12 %  due to electron scattering and their polarization increases after optical maximum light ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; however , the polarization falls to zero at very late times , when the electron scattering opacity becomes very low ( e.g. , @xcite ) . the typical line polarization profile  actually mostly due to electron polarized light interacting with a line  predicted theoretically @xcite and to some degree confirmed observationally in sn  1987a and other supernovae @xcite , is an inverted p  cygni profile : strong polarization maximum at the flux p  cygni trough feature and polarization minimum at the flux p  cygni emission feature .",
    "line blending and other intrinsic effects can distort these profiles . for sn 1998bw ,",
    "an intrinsic optical polarization of @xmath13@xmath14 % was found , suggesting an asymmetry of less than @xmath15 in the axial ratio of the ejecta @xcite .",
    "no distinct line polarization features were seen probably due to the poor s / n or the relatively narrow wavelength range of those observations .",
    "the spectropolarimetry was taken with the 8.2-m subaru telescope equipped with the faint object camera and spectrograph ( focas , @xcite ) from 2002 february 9 through june 9 . for february and june observations",
    ", we used a 300 grooves mm@xmath16 grism ( the central wavelength of 5500  ) with a @xmath17 width slit , resulting a spectral resolution ( @xmath18 ) was @xmath19 . for march observation",
    ", we used another 300 gr mm@xmath16 grism ( 7500  ) with a @xmath20 width slit , resulting in @xmath21 .",
    "the nightly total exposure time was 960 to 4000 sec .",
    "the linear polarimetric module of focas consists of a rotating superachromatic half - wave plate and a crystal quartz wollaston prism , and both the ordinary and the extraordinary rays are simultaneously recorded on two mit / ll ccds ( 2k@xmath224k@xmath2215 ) . a typical observing sequence consisted of four integrations at the @xmath23 and @xmath24 positions of the half - wave plate .",
    "stokes @xmath25 and @xmath26 were calculated as in  6.1.2 of @xcite . for polarimetric calibration",
    ", we obtained data for unpolarized and polarized standard stars , including measurements of flatfield lamps through fully - polarizing filters .",
    "the flux was calibrated using observations of g191b2b and bd+28@xmath274211 @xcite , and then was multiplied by a constant to match the vsnet photometric data .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the observed flux and polarization spectra .",
    "several blueshifted broad absorption lines can be identified in the february flux spectrum @xcite . for march and",
    "june flux spectra a detailed analysis has yet to be done .",
    "however , we note that the march spectra resemble that of sn  1997ef at day 67 @xcite , including the onset of net emission in @xmath288498 , 8542 , 8662 ( i.e. , the ir triplet )",
    ". the significant emission line at @xmath29  in the june spectrum is identified as [ ] @xmath106300 , 6363 as in sn  1997ef @xcite .",
    "the polarization is @xmath30 %  at a position angle ( pa ) of @xmath31 over the observed wavelengths .",
    "significant day - by - day variation is not seen in the polarization spectra within each month . here",
    "we will only analyze monthly averages .",
    "interstellar polarization ( isp ) varies slowly with wavelength in the optical and is well approximated by the empirical formula @xmath32 $ ] , where @xmath33 is the peak polarization ( @xcite , hereafter smf ) . in march",
    "the emission feature of the ir triplet line profile shows strong net emission due to nlte processes .",
    "such nlte line flux is necessarily unpolarized on emission . since the line profile is still broad ( absorption minimum at a @xmath34 km s@xmath16 redshift , corresponding to an enclosed mass of 2 m@xmath35 in model co100/4 , which has a total mass of 2.4 m@xmath35 @xcite ) , much of the emission is probably coming from far out in the ejecta , where the electron optical depth is low .",
    "we conclude that the flux from this emission line is mostly unscattered by electrons and unpolarized , and that it dilutes the polarized electron scattered flux .",
    "if this were the only effect , then the intrinsic polarization should show a distinct minimum nearly exactly at the wavelength of the flux emission maximum . since , in fact , the polarization is roughly constant across the p  cygni emission feature ( @xmath36@xmath37  ) , apart from small variations that may be mostly noise , the line is not only diluting the polarized flux but is also probably strongly depolarizing it .",
    "the intrinsic polarization across the emission feature is probably close to zero .",
    "we will assume that the observed polarization of the emission feature is the isp : thus @xmath38 % .",
    "we next adopt the median @xmath39    found by smf for 30 stars with @xmath40 .",
    "then from a non - linear regression we find @xmath41 %  and @xmath42 .",
    "( the uncertainties are crude estimates based on the alternative assumption that only line flux dilution , and not line depolarization , occurs in the region of the ir triplet emission feature . ) since @xcite derive a color excess for sn  2002ap of @xmath43 ( a sum of @xmath44 within our galaxy and @xmath45 within m74 ) from interstellar na d absorptions , our assumption of the smf @xmath46 is consistent : @xmath47 .",
    "the estimated isp ( eisp ) is consistent with other factors . in an isp catalog @xcite ,",
    "16 stars are within @xmath48 of sn  2002ap .",
    "the data for these stars suggest a possible positive correlation between polarization and the distance along the line of sight toward sn  2002ap .",
    "the two most distant stars among them , hd8919 ( @xmath49 pc ) and hd9560 ( @xmath50 pc ) show @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , @xmath54 , respectively . on the other hand",
    ", it has been found that @xmath55 has an empirical upper limit of @xmath56 ( smf ) . from the derived @xmath57 , an upper limit on the isp toward the supernova",
    "is @xmath58 % .",
    "the eisp is nicely sandwiched between the possible lower bounds of the cited stars and the empirical upper limit .",
    "the eisp position angle is also consistent with the position angle of the spiral arm in m74 at the position of sn  2002ap , @xmath59@xmath60 ( see dposs images ) .",
    "the june 9 polarization spectrum has polarization consistent with the eisp at the peak of the strong emission flux of the [ ] @xmath106300 , 6363 forbidden line ( figure [ fig1]c ) : one would expect that polarization to be isp for a strong emission line in the nebular epoch .",
    "( the june 9 data has low s / n : in the following , we analyze only the higher s / n polarization spectra of the earlier two epochs .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the intrinsic ( i.e , eisp - subtracted ) polarization plotted on a _ qu _ diagram : the polarization points are connected according to their wavelength ordering .",
    "given the uncertainty in the eisp , points within @xmath61 %  of the origin must be considered very uncertain .",
    "if one assumes that the intrinsic supernova polarization is produced by a single axisymmetric component in the ejecta , then the intrinsic polarization plotted on a _ qu _ diagram should lie on a line passing through the origin .",
    "it can be seen that the polarization in february has two clear position angles , pa less than or @xmath62 ( associated with the / line trough ) and pa@xmath63 ( associated with the continuum from @xmath64@xmath65  ) , joined by a somewhat complicated transition .",
    "the polarization in march has a clear position angle pa@xmath66 associated with the line trough and with at least some of the continuum .",
    "we conclude that there are multiple asymmetric components , and that their contribution varies with time .",
    "it is likely that the recession of the supernova photosphere uncovers different asymmetries .",
    "figures [ fig3]a , b , and c show the flux and intrinsic polarization corrected for heliocentric redshift [ @xmath67 @xcite ] and interstellar extinction ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the figures show that polarization is low and barely significant ( given the uncertainty in the eisp ) , except in the regions @xmath68@xmath69   for february and @xmath68@xmath70   for march",
    ".    the low continuum polarization blueward of @xmath68   in both epochs may be due to the depolarizing effect of lines @xcite : in supernova spectra , lines generally become stronger further to the blue .",
    "the continuum polarization , where it is significant ( a relatively small region ) is @xmath71 % in both epochs .",
    "if the asymmetry is assumed to be an axisymmetric , global prolate or oblate asymmetry , then the continuum polarization can be explained by an axial ratio ( assuming there is a main axis ) projected on the sky that is different from 1 by of order @xmath5 % .",
    "this estimate is a crude one based on realistic , but parameterized , calculations @xcite .",
    "the estimate is also crude because , as noted above , the asymmetry can not be completely axisymmetric .",
    "the estimated asymmetry is not large , compared to those estimated for some other supernovae ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the three distinct line polarization profiles seen in figure  [ fig3 ] ( at the / flux absorption in february and the and flux absorptions in march ) can partially be accounted for by the inverted p  cygni profile ( see   1 ) : the polarization maxima associated with line trough features are clear . without detailed modeling more information probably can not be extracted from these profiles .",
    "for the february continuum polarization , we suggest a radically different origin from the bulk asymmetry assumed in prolate / oblate models or element inhomogeneity models ( see below ) . in figure",
    "[ fig3]d we show the intrinsic polarized flux ( @xmath72 ) compared to the observed flux scaled down by a factor of @xmath73 and non - relativistically redshifted by a velocity of @xmath74 : i.e. , @xmath75 .",
    "there is fair agreement over the range @xmath76@xmath69  . in response to this comparison",
    ", @xcite made a similar comparison for their sn 2002ap spectropolarimetry and also obtained a similarly good agreement .",
    "the agreement suggests ( but does not prove ) that a large component of polarized flux comes from electron scattering in an ionized clump ( i.e. , a jet ) thrown out of the supernova explosion .",
    "( we assume a single jet or clump for simplicity here , although a pair of bipolar jets are a physical possibility ( e.g. , @xcite ) . ) in a simple non - relativistic picture , the scattered light is redshifted by @xmath77 , where , @xmath78 , @xmath79 is the characteristic velocity of scattering relative to the supernova center , and @xmath80 is the inclination angle of jet to the line of sight measured from the far side of the supernova .",
    "the jet polarization component is calculated from @xmath81}{f(\\lambda ) } \\mbox { , } \\ ] ] where @xmath82 is the corrected flux , @xmath83 is the blueshift back to the origin of the scattered flux observed at @xmath10 , and the scale factor @xmath84 : @xmath85 accounts both for the polarization of the jet scattered flux and the fraction scattered .",
    "the polarization is wavelength dependent even though electron scattering is wavelength - independent since the scattered flux comes from a bluer part of the spectrum than the part it is added to .",
    "electron scattering depends on scattering direction : e.g. , maximum polarization occurs for @xmath86 ; half as much for @xmath87 or @xmath88 ; zero for @xmath89 or @xmath90 .",
    "the jet velocities corresponding to @xmath86 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 are @xmath74 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 , respectively .",
    "thus @xmath94 is a lower bound on the jet velocity and @xmath95 would require a somewhat relativistic jet .",
    "high velocity jet - like clumps have been proposed in some hydrodynamic explosion models for sne and grb s ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if a jet is thrown out of an exploding supernova core , then it is plausible that it carries some radioactive @xmath96ni .",
    "the gamma - rays from decay would keep the jet ionized to some degree just as they keep the nebular phase bulk ejecta ionized .    if the jet picture is correct , then the position angle of the jet on the sky is @xmath97 ( or @xmath98 ) since the jet polarization component has position angle @xmath99 and electron scattering polarizes perpendicularly to the scattering plane .",
    "the / line polarization maximum in the february data can not easily be associated with the jet .",
    "as figure  2 shows , the observed position angle makes an excursion from @xmath99 up to @xmath100 across the polarization maximum .",
    "some of the line polarization may arise in the bulk asymmetry of the supernova .",
    "it is possible that the position angle of @xmath101 is the net result of a jet polarizing at @xmath99 and a bulk asymmetry polarizing at @xmath102 ( i.e. , at the position angle observed in the march data ) . to test this model",
    "we have eliminated the jet polarization component from the february intrinsic polarization by subtracting jet polarization stokes parameters from the intrinsic polarization stokes parameters . the residual polarization and position angle spectra are plotted in figures [ fig3]e , f .",
    "the position angle of the residual polarization for february from the region of significant polarization ( i.e. , @xmath68@xmath69  ) is now approximately centered on @xmath103 and deviates by more than @xmath104 only in a few isolated points .",
    "the results in figure  [ fig3]f are thus consistent with the jet model .",
    "the jet may not be a completely separated amount of ejecta , but rather a blob rich in @xmath96ni moving at @xmath105 .",
    "a high - velocity , @xmath96ni - rich region is required both in the hypernova explosion models of sn 1998bw @xcite , and in sn  2002ap @xcite in order to reproduce the light curves .",
    "spectral synthesis for sn  2002ap @xcite suggests some material at velocities higher than the photospheric velocities of @xmath106@xmath107 @xcite up to @xmath108 .",
    "the ionization of the blob would likely be increased by radioactive @xmath96ni and this would likely make the blob more polarizing than other parts of the ejecta at the same velocity leading to net polarization .",
    "other chemical inhomogeneities in the ejecta at varying velocities are also possible @xcite and would affect polarization in complicated ways .",
    "our results are summarized in the abstract .",
    "more realistic modeling is necessary for a more definitive understanding of the polarization .",
    "the degree of the bulk asymmetry suggested in this paper may be tested with the line widths and their ratios in the nebular spectrum @xcite .",
