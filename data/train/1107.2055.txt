    "ultra - high energy crs with energies above @xmath2  ev arrive at earth with a frequency of less than one event per square - kilometer - year ( _ i.e. _  with an energy flux of 30  ev  @xmath3  s@xmath4 ) in @xmath5 steradian . the recently completed pierre auger observatory @xcite with a surface detector covering an area of about @xmath6  km@xmath7 is thus able to detect up to several hundred uhe cr events per year .",
    "however , due to the steeply falling cr spectrum the arrival frequency drops by about two orders of magnitude as we go up in energy by one decade , leaving only a few events per year detectable at energies around @xmath8  ev .",
    "hence , the statistical uncertainty associated with the upper end of the spectrum is still large , limiting our knowledge of uhe cr composition and origin .    before their arrival",
    ", uhe crs must propagate across the astronomical distance between their source and earth .",
    "the relevant interactions of uhe cr nuclei during propagation are bethe - heitler pair production and photo - disintegration in collisions with photons of the cosmic background radiation .",
    "the cross - sections of both these processes rise quickly above the threshold values of about 1  mev and 10  mev , respectively , in the nuclei s rest - frame . at even higher energies above 150",
    "mev pion production turns on and becomes the dominant energy loss process .",
    "however , for the uhe cr cutoff energies and composition we consider , which are motivated by the most recent auger results , this process never plays a dominant role and may be safely neglected",
    ".    provided the propagation time from their sources to earth is greater than their energy loss time , uhe crs invariably undergo these energy loss interactions .",
    "the break - up of nuclei via photo - disintegration produces lower mass nuclei with the same lorentz factor . for heavy nuclei ,",
    "the most dominant transitions are one - nucleon and two - nucleon losses .",
    "secondary heavy nuclei remain close to the photo - disintegration resonance and quickly disintegrate further to lighter nuclei .",
    "hence , on resonance , the initial mass composition of the sources is quickly shifted to lower atomic number values and in general shows a strong dependence on cr energy .",
    "the arriving flux from an ensemble of uhe cr sources can be expected to contain suppression features at the high energies at which the photo - disintegration processes turn on and the nuclei particle s attenuation length decreases .",
    "most prominently , for the case of a proton - dominated spectrum , the flux is expected to be suppressed by the _ greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin _ ( gzk ) cutoff  @xcite due to resonant pion photo - production interactions with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "intriguingly , a suppression of the cr spectrum at about @xmath9  ev has been observed at a statistically significant level  @xcite . however , since a similar feature may also appear in the spectrum from nuclei primaries , the observation of such a feature provides little clue as to the underlying composition . such a suppression feature becomes a cutoff in the arriving flux if the attenuation length drops below the distance to the nearest uhe cr source .",
    "thus , the shape of the suppression / cutoff feature does contain information about the source distribution , as has been investigated already for the case of uhe cr protons  @xcite .    on their arrival at earth ,",
    "uhe crs interact with molecules in the atmosphere and deposit their energy in the form of extensive air showers .",
    "the characteristics of these showers along the shower depth @xmath10 ( in g/@xmath11 ) contain vital uhe cr composition information . on average ,",
    "proton - induced showers reach their maximum development , @xmath12 , deeper in the atmosphere than do showers of the same energy generated by heavier nuclei . accompanying this effect , the shower to shower fluctuation of @xmath13 about the mean , @xmath14 ,",
    "is larger for proton - induced showers than for iron - induced showers of the same energy . as a result ,",
    "measurements of both @xmath12 and @xmath14 can be used to infer the average chemical composition of the uhe crs as a function of energy .",
    "auger has now released their first measurement results of @xmath14  @xcite , along with those of @xmath12 .",
    "these results seem to imply that the uhe cr spectrum contains a large fraction of intermediate or heavy mass nuclei , becoming increasingly heavy at high energies ( @xmath15  ev ) .",
    "furthermore , the small values of @xmath14 measured by auger also imply that uhe crs are composed of species with a relatively narrow distribution of charge at the highest measured energies , containing little or no protons or light nuclei . in this way , the new @xmath14 measurements not only confirm and reinforce the conclusions drawn from their earlier average depth of shower maximum measurements , but also provide complementary information that enables one to constrain the distribution of the various chemical species present within the uhe cr spectrum .",
    "curiously , recent corresponding measurements by the telescope array uhe cr detector do not appear to agree with the auger results @xcite , and instead seem to be consistent with a light composition as was indicated by its predecessor hires  @xcite .",
    "though an understanding of this conflict is crucial for future progress in the field , we here chose to adopt only the auger results .",
    "interestingly , the intermediate - heavy nuclei scenario emerging from these measurements may find consistency with the presently observed mild departure from isotropy and absence of point sources observed at uhe @xcite .",
    "this could occur through the introduction of @xmath16 deflections in the turbulent ( @xmath17 g ) galactic magnetic field structure @xcite or in 0.1  ng turbulent extragalactic field structure @xcite , from an anisotropic distribution of nearby sources .",
    "such large deflections would limit the prospects for future uhe cr astronomy for all but the brightest and closest sources .",
    "the correlation of uhe cr with nearby objects , however , still awaits to be resolved within an intermediate - heavy nuclei framework , and deserves further consideration .",
    "following our previous investigations into the composition of uhe crs  @xcite , an intermediate - heavy ( silicon - to - iron ) type composition was found to be motivated by the present complete auger data set , with a hard ( @xmath18 ) injection spectral index .. ] furthermore , this agreement received only very mild improvements by the additional consideration of an admixture of species .",
    "building further on these results , we here focus on the local uhe cr source distribution inferred to exist if the observed trend in the composition continues up to highest energies observed by the ground array ( @xmath19  ev ) . by considering simple silicon and iron source composition scenarios , we investigate how far away these sources can afford to be without detrimentally damaging the agreement with the auger data .",
    "to aid this investigation we utilise an analytic description of uhe cr nuclei propagation already developed by the authors  @xcite .",
    "with no prior knowledge about the uhe cr source population , a `` universal '' ( homogeneous and isotropic ) distribution is generally assumed . we adopt this assumption here as a means of investigating signatures of a departure from it . in order to quantify the effect of a different source distribution in this paper , we separate out the fluxes produced from source regions with shells of radii 0 - 3  mpc , 3 - 9  mpc , 9 - 27  mpc , 27 - 81  mpc , and 81 - 243  mpc surrounding the earth . in this way",
