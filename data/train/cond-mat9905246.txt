    "a large amount of information about both static and dynamic properties of materials that exhibit high - temperature superconductivity , is available through experimental techniques like nuclear quadrupole and magnetic resonances ( nqr and nmr ) . in particular ,",
    "the electric field gradients have been determined for a variety of nuclei with great accuracy  @xcite .",
    "these quantities are ground - state properties of the solid and depend sensitively on how charge is shared among the atomic and molecular orbitals . measurements of the knight shift and the various nuclear elaxation rate tensors as a function of temperature , doping , and orientation of the applied field with respect to the crystalline axes , provide insight into the static spin density distribution and the low frequency spin dynamics of the electrons in the normal as well as in the superconducting state  @xcite . owing to the abundances of nuclei with suitable nuclear magnetic and quadrupole moments ,",
    "most of these quantites can be studied on different sites in the unit cell .",
    "this allows one to distinguish static and dynamic features in the cuo@xmath0 planes from those in the interlayer region .",
    "the analysis of numerous early nqr and nmr experiments focussed on the question whether a one - component model is sufficient to describe the low - energy excitations of the quantum fluid in the high - temperature superconductors or whether a two - component description is needed .",
    "knight shift and relaxation rate data for the cu sites in yba@xmath0cu@xmath3o@xmath4 that were analyzed on the basis of the hyperfine coupling of a cu@xmath2 ion in an axial symmetric surroundig , seemed to be controversial .",
    "mila and rice  @xcite proposed then that besides the usual on - site hyperfine interactions at a cu nucleus an additional hyperfine field should be considered which is transferred from neighboring cu ions .",
    "they gave a consistent explanation of the unusual combination of anisotropies of the cu knight shifts and relaxation rates in yba@xmath0cu@xmath3o@xmath4 within a one - component theory .",
    "an estimation of the strength of the various hyperfine parameters with the use of a quantum chemical model led to good agreement with the values deduced from experiment .",
    "monien , pines , and slichter  @xcite analyzed a more complete set of data from which they inferred the relevant hyperfine couplings and the associated fluctuation times .",
    "the ensuing constraints on theoretical one - component models for the planar magnetic excitations comprise a large transferred hyperfine field between adjacent cu@xmath2 spins , which , moreover , must be very nearly aligned antiferromagnetically , and , in addition , an almost perfect cancellation between the parallel component of the dipolar hyperfine tensor and the total transferred field @xmath5 . provided that the spin susceptibility is isotropic , it is only with the latter condition that the vanishing of the parallel component of the spin contributions to the knight shift can be explained .    a remaining intricate problem whose explanation seemed to require a two - band model , was the relaxation behavior of the planar oxygen nuclei which was strikingly different from that of the coppers .",
    "shastry  @xcite , however , pointed out that spin density is also transferred to the planar oxygens .",
    "a transferred hyperfine field couples a nucleus to spin fluctuations on neighboring cu sites .",
    "this implies that the spin - lattice relaxation time @xmath6 depends on form factors given by the local geometry of lattice sites of the nucleus and its neighbors .",
    "since the form factor entering @xmath7 vanishes at the commensurate antiferromagnetic wave vector @xmath8 where that for @xmath9 reaches a maximum , the variant temperature dependence of @xmath7 and @xmath9 could be understood from the presence of strong antiferromagnetic correlations between the copper spins in the planes .",
    "thus a coherent picture of the low - energy spin dynamics in the cuo@xmath0 planes seemed to be established  @xcite and numerous nmr and nqr experiments were analyzed on the basis of these hyperfine spin hamiltonians and a one - band model .",
    "pines and coworkers developed  @xcite a phenomenological expression for the dynamic spin susceptibility and provided  @xcite a quantitative description of a variety of nmr data .",
    "new doubts about the adequacy of a one - component description of the spin fluid arose when the results of neutron scattering data became available .",
    "nmr and neutrons both probe the spin susceptibility . in la@xmath10sr@xmath11cuo@xmath1 , a considerable degree of incommensuration of the peaks in the spin - fluctuation spectrum was observed  @xcite . as a consequence , the nmr relaxation time @xmath7 is expected to exhibit an anomalous temperature dependence which is not seen experimentally .",
    "this and other contradictions between the results of nmr and neutron - scattering experiments led zha , barzykin , and pines  @xcite to a critical re - examination of the hyperfine spin hamiltonian .",
    "they showed that it is possible to reconcile nmr and neutron - scattering experiments on both la@xmath12sr@xmath13cuo@xmath1 and yba@xmath0cu@xmath3o@xmath14 within a one - component theory by introducing a transferred hyperfine coupling between the o nuclei and their next - nearest - neighbor cu@xmath2 spins .",
    "in addition , the analysis exhibited that the hyperfine coupling transferred to the cu nuclei changes as one goes from the la@xmath12sr@xmath13cuo@xmath1 to the yba@xmath0cu@xmath3o@xmath14 system , and is moreover comparatively sensitive to hole doping in the former system .",
    "despite the rich information of nmr and nqr results about the nature of the spin fluid and the low - energy quasiparticles , there exist only few theoretical first - principles approaches which address the determination of electric - field gradients and magnetic hyperfine interactions . for the yba@xmath0cu@xmath3o@xmath14 system , electric - field gradients ( efgs ) at the various nuclear sites have been obtained by das and coworkers  @xcite with _",
    "ab - initio _ cluster calculations using the unrestricted hartree - fock ( uhf ) method , and by schwarz and coworkers  @xcite who employed the full - potential linear augmented - plane - wave method within the local density approximation ( lda ) . results of hartree - fock ( hf ) calculations have also been published by winter  @xcite .",
    "apart from one exception , the efgs calculated with these three different methods more or less agree and reproduce the experimental data quite satisfactorily .",
    "the exceptional case is the efg at the planar cu sites .",
    "using a large cluster that contained 74 atoms , we recently performed  @xcite calculations with the density functional ( df ) method and obtained values for the cu efgs which are in better agreement with the experiments .",
    "these calculations were non - spin polarized and no information on magnetic hyperfine interactions is available .",

    "this discrepancy has sometimes been used to assign a fractional hole number to the @xmath52 orbital .",
    "the underlying physical picture , however , is completely misleading since the contributions to the efg originate from various cu shells as can be seen in table  [ tab : contr ] . the cluster efg value of 1.4 as obtained with the df method , results from cancellations between relatively large individual contributions .",

    "for each spin projection there exists a total of 23 molecular orbitals ( mo ) that can be formed as linear combinations of the cu 3d and the six o 2p atomic orbitals ( ao ) . both hf and",

    "the energies of all 23 mos are shown in fig .",
    "[ mos ] together with the contributions from the individual aos .",
    "the length of the bars marks the squared values of the expansion coefficient of the mo with respect to the aos whereby spin - up ( spin - down ) orbitals are denoted by solid ( dotted ) bars .    the orbitals with second highest energy are anti - bonding linear combinations of the aos 3d@xmath56 of the cu and o 2p@xmath57 of the apical oxygens . in the df calculation , these are followed at energies around -1.5 ev by mos that can be formed as anti - bonding hybridizations with the three other cu 3d aos .",
    "deeper in energy , between -2.6 and -4.4 ev , are the mos that are composed of oxygens only without contributions from cu . they comprise the 2p@xmath57 aos of the planar oxygens and the 2p@xmath54 and 2p@xmath55 of the apex oxygens . at the hf level , these are at energies ( -1.1 to -1.8 ev ) that are above those of the mos with contributions from cu 3d@xmath58 .    the mo with lowest energy in fig .",
    "[ mos ] is at -5.8 ev for df .",

    "their energies and wave functions are only slightly different for the two spin projections though it is precisely this difference that will determine the core polarization and also contributes to the electric field gradient .",
    "therefore it is essential to describe also inner - shell electrons with basis sets of sufficiently high quality .",
    "the hf result suggests an almost purely ionic bonding with small overlap between cu and o. in contrast , the df results emphasize the covalent character of the bonds and an appreciable overlap .",
    "this varient description of bonding is also reflected in the width of the `` d - band '' ( 10 ev vs. 6 ev ) and the localization of the atomic spin density at the cu ( 0.90 vs. 0.67 ) .",
    "the contributions of the df mos shown in fig .",
    "[ mos ] to the density of states is represented in fig .  [ dos ] .",
    "the individual states were broadened by folding with a gaussian function of half - width 0.21 ev .",
    "a comparison to the density of states obtained from band structure calculations  @xcite shows an overall agreement even for the small cluster under consideration .",
    "the total occupation of the df cu atomic orbitals amounts to 8.92 which results from the following contributions : .08 , .89 , .96 , .96 , .92 , .97 from 4s , 3d@xmath56 , 3d@xmath60 , 3d@xmath61 , 3d@xmath53 , 3d@xmath61 with spin up and .07 , .66 , .96 , .96 , .27 , 1.00 with spin down .",
    "the small population of the cu 4s ao is due to the fact that the hybridization between the 3d@xmath56 and the 2p@xmath57 of the apex oxygens also involves a minor admixture of 4s orbitals .",

    "@xcite .    in conclusion",
    ", we think that the cu - o bonding is better described by df methods , which include part of the correlation , than with hf .",

    "to investigate the convergence of the calculated efgs and magnetic hyperfine properties with respect to cluster size , calculations for clusters comprising @xmath62 cu atoms ( @xmath63 ) have been performed using the hf method as well as df with gga ( blyp - functional ) .",

    "the magnetic hyperfine interaction at a nucleus can be decomposed into an isotropic part d and a traceless dipolar part .",
    "the former is given by the difference between the spin densities at the nuclear site r : @xmath76 where the sums extend over all occupied mos .",

    "it is obvious that in a first approximation the increase of d(cu ) is linear in the number of nearest neighbor cu atoms for both df and hf methods .",
    "it is suggestive to attribute this change to a transferred hyperfine term b and to decompose d(cu ) into @xmath84 with preliminary values : a @xmath85 and b @xmath86 0.69 for df / blyp and a @xmath87 and b  @xmath88 for hf .    for those oxygen sites that are at the border of the cluster and",

    "there is an excess of positive spin density in the central region which is also reflected by the atomic spin densities at the four oxygens that are bridging two antiferromagnetically coupled cu atoms .",
    "there , a value of 0.026 is obtained instead of the cancellation expected for a large system .    to account for these finite size effects",
    ", we have carefully analyzed all results given in tables  [ asd ] and  [ asdm ] .",
    "it turned out that the values of the core - polarization at the oxygens are proportional to the sum of atomic spin densities at the adjacent cu ions @xmath102 where the sum extends over one or two nn .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "the negative values result from the spin states with lower multiplicities .",
    "the deviations from the linear behavior for some small d(o)-values is due to errors in forming the difference between large @xmath103 values with opposite signs .",
    "similarly , the core - polarization at the cu ions can well be reproduced by decomposing it according to @xmath104 in fig .  [ dcu ]",
    "the various values @xmath105 are plotted as a function of the sum of nn atomic spin densities divided by @xmath106 .    with all these data available ,",
    "we are now in a position to study the intrinsic and transferred hyperfine fields in a quantitative manner and to estimate also the influence of next - nearest and further distant cu atoms .",
    "the isotropic hyperfine constants at the oxygens were assumed to depend on the spin densities of the adjacent ( nn ) , next - nearest - neighbors ( nnn ) and further distant cu atoms according to    @xmath107    for cu , the isotropic hyperfine constants were decomposed into    @xmath108    figs .",
    "[ do ] and [ dcu ] already show that the main contributions are due to nn .",
    "this result is corroborated by least squares fits of all data to eqs .",
    "( [ eqdo ] ) and ( [ eqdcu ] ) which yield    @xmath109    and @xmath110 as expected , the contributions from cu ions beyond nn are marginal .    the analyses performed so far have demonstrated that all hyperfine coupling parameters are proportional to the sum of the atomic spin densities at the adjacent cu ions .",
    "the essential point is that in this way also the values calculated for lower spin multiplicities could be accounted for .",
    "these contain complementary informations to the results of high - spin states which strongly improve the quality of the results as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ do ] and [ dcu ] .",
    "incorporating negative values of @xmath111 into the evaluation renders a much better understanding of the various contributions .",
    "we are now in a position to extrapolate the data from the finite clusters to an extended system . considering the three different values of @xmath106 in the largest cluster ( see table  [ asd ] )",
    ", we expect @xmath112 in the homogeneous case to be 0.70 .",
    "this leads to the following values : a = @xmath113 , b = 0.714 , @xmath114 , c = 0.648 , and @xmath115 .",
    "it should be emphasized again , that the extracted values for the contact terms depend on the particular choice of the exchange - correlation functional .",
    "we have performed a few calculations with other functionals , too .",
    "they deliver values that differ by 15 % but they also lead to the conclusion that contributions from further distant neighbors are not important .",
    "in contrast to the core - polarization , which is proportional to the spin density difference at a single point , the dipolar hyperfine coupling results from a spatial average of @xmath116 with wave - functions .",
    "its value , therefore , can be determined with much greater accuray than that of the contact interaction and does less crucially depend on the calculational method or the choice of the exchange - correlation functionals .",
    "it is given by @xmath117 where @xmath118 in table  [ tab : adip ] the values for @xmath119 ( for cu ) and @xmath120 ( for o ) obtained with various clusters are given .",
    "it should be remarked that @xmath121 for planar oxygen refers to the directions along the cu - o - cu bonds .",
    "the tensor coupling is only nearly axially symmetric .    in analogy to the isotropic case , the dipolar contributions also turned out to depend mainly on the atomic spin densities of the nn copper ions besides the on - site term for cu which is proportional to the on - site atomic spin density .",
    "a least squares fit of all data ( including those with lower multiplicities ) to the ansatz    @xmath122    gives @xmath123 , and @xmath124 .",
    "thus there is also a small transferred dipolar hyperfine interaction for cu .    for the oxygens , the ansatz    @xmath125    leads to @xmath126 , and @xmath127 .    performing the same extrapolation as was applied to the isotropic contributions , we finally get @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 ( along the bond direction ) , @xmath131 ( perpendicular to the bond ) , and @xmath132 ( perpendicular to the plane ) .",
    "represented in table  [ tab : compilo ] are the magnetic hyperfine couplings calculated for o(p ) .",
    "the spin - orbit contributions to the hyperfine fields are expected to be small in the case of o. we neglect them completely by assuming @xmath133 . these values may be compared to those which have been extracted from various experiments in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite .      to investigate the mechanisms of spin transfer",
    ", we will analyze in detail the results from the two clusters containing one and two copper atoms and point out the differences .",
    "we commence by noting that the basic notions of spin - polarized density functional theory  @xcite rely on the concept of expressing all physical relevant quantities in terms of the spin densities alone .",
    "the `` wave functions '' are just auxiliary entities that are introduced to solve the kohn - sham equations  @xcite and have no direct physical meaning . nevertheless , to understand the origins of transferred hyperfine fields , it is convenient to assign the aos which are built up from localized basis functions to atomic single - electron wave functions . similarly , the mos are interpreted as hybridizations between the individual aos .",
    "another remark concerns the representation of the aos in terms of basis functions .",
    "we recall that the employed basis sets describe a `` single - electron wave function '' as a linear combination of several contracted radial gauss functions . for cu , there are three radial functions for each of the five 3d - orbitals and nine functions of s - like character . for o , we have four s - functions and three radial functions for each of the 2p - orbitals .",
    "let us first consider the ( cuo@xmath16)@xmath134 ion embedded in the appropriate lattice .",
    "overlap and covalent effects convey spin density from the cu@xmath2 ion onto the ligand oxygen sites whose spin direction is parallel to that of the local cu moment .",
    "the data in table  [ cuo6 ] show that in the df calculations the atomic spin density @xmath135 is reduced from 1 to 0.667 in favor of a spin density transfer to the four planar oxygens ( @xmath136 = 0.328 ) .",
    "the transfer from the cu to the o(p ) is much less pronounced at the hf level where @xmath112 = 0.902 .",
    "this trend is also reflected in the dipolar hyperfine coupling ( see table  [ tab : adip ] ) : @xmath137 and @xmath138 for df ( hf ) with a total of @xmath139 .",
    "the transferred spin density is mainly on the o 2p@xmath140 orbital , but a small amount also goes to the o 2s which is thus expected to be polarized parallel to the spin density on the cu .",
    "indeed , we get @xmath141 , as can be seen in table  [ tab : fermio ] where the core polarizations @xmath142 from df calculations are listed for the individual orbitals .",
    "the 2s orbital in turn polarizes the 1s but with opposite sign ( @xmath143 ) .",
    "since the mos are linear combinations of aos , the contact term may also have contributions that come from a product of an s - like ao centered at the nucleus under consideration with an ao centered on an adjacent atom .",
    "these contributions turn out to be small .",
    "they are listed separately as numbers in parentheses in tables  [ tab : fermio ] and  [ tab : fermicu ] . on the cu ,",
    "the delocalization of spin densities implies the following changes .",
    "the mo second highest in energy ( at @xmath144 ev ) is occupied with a spin - down electron .",
    "it mainly mixes the cu 3d@xmath145 with the o(a ) 2p@xmath146 but has also some small contributions from the cu 4s and the o(p ) 2p@xmath140 orbitals .",
    "the admixture of the 4s is larger than that of the following orbital ( at @xmath147 ev ) which has the same symmetry but is occupied with a spin - up electron .",
    "these two mos thus cause the negative value @xmath148 ( see table  [ tab : fermicu ] ) .",
    "the 4s ao in turn polarizes the inner s orbitals .",
    "the alternating signs of the 4s , 3s , and 2s contributions  @xcite are a consequence of the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "we next consider the system consisting of 2 cu atoms with parallel moments and with 1 bridging o ( o@xmath149 ) and 6 planar o ( o@xmath150 ) bonded to one of the cu only .",
    "the df calculations yield the atomic spin densities @xmath112 = 0.668 , @xmath151 = 0.130 , and @xmath152 = 0.089 .",
    "since the 2p@xmath140 orbital can only share a maximal amount of hole contribution , the additional transfer of spin density onto the o@xmath149 is less than twice the value in the cuo@xmath16 system .",
    "the missing fraction is added to the six o@xmath150 .",
    "more positive spin density , however , can be put on the 2s which leads to the total value @xmath153 ( see table  [ tab : fermio ] ) .",
    "the dipolar contributions are @xmath154 and @xmath155 . on the cu atoms , the spin density distributions in the inner s shells",
    "can not be changed significantly compared to the cuo@xmath16 case since not much redistribution is possible in the inner core .",
    "therefore the additional positive spin density resides mainly on the 4s atomic orbital .",
    "we thus get a coherent picture of the spin density distributions for a single cu@xmath2 ion surrounded by four planar oxygens and of the additional spin transfers caused by a second copper ion .",
    "the interpretation in terms of localized aos turned out to be helpful for the understanding of the spin densities which are the relevant quantities in density functional theory .",
    "the results of our quantum chemical calculations demonstrate that the spin densities , when attributed to the cu or to the o , are strongly connected . in the ground state",
    ", there is no reason for advocating a two - component model and we also see little chance that low - energy excited states could change this fact .      for cu",
    ", the spin - orbit coupling gives an appreciable contribution to the total hyperfine fields , especially in the perpendicular direction since accidentally a and @xmath156 almost cancel ( @xmath157 ) .",
    "a calculation of the spin - orbit interaction can not be carried out at the same level of quality as is possible for the other hyperfine interactions .",
    "therefore we adopt the values for the isolated cu@xmath2 ion from ref .",
    "@xcite in the simplified form used in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath158 and @xmath159 with a parameter value k = @xmath160 . with @xmath161",
    ", we get @xmath162 = 2.405 and @xmath163 = 0.427 .",
    "it should be noted that the uncertainty in the spin - orbit coupling parameter and the excitation energies is comparatively large .",
    "therefore , in ref .  @xcite a range of values for k of @xmath164 20 % was considered .    in table",
    "[ tab : compilcu ] all our calculated values for the hyperfine coupling parameters for cu are compiled .",
    "the spin - orbit contributions are put in parentheses to emphasize that they are estimated .",
    "no direct experimental information is available on these parameters .",
    "they can be determined indirectly from a combination of anisotropic knight shifts and relaxation rates and the nuclear resonance frequencies in antiferromagnetic compounds .",
    "the results of various analyses are shown in table  [ tab : compilcu ] .",
    "our values are in reasonable agreement with the data .",
    "the electronic structure of la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 has been investigated by first - principles cluster calculations .",
    "these have the advantage that local properties can be studied in great detail but usually suffer from a somewhat uncontrolled embedding in the periodic lattice and surface problems . by using a sequence of clusters containing up to nine copper atoms",
    ", we have demonstrated which quantities can be evaluated with clusters of modest size .",
    "as concerns the theoretical approximations to treat the many - electron problem in cuo@xmath0 planes , we have shown that distinct differences between the hartree - fock and density functional methods exist . from our results",
    "we conclude that the former approach , which neglects correlations entirely , is not adequate for cuprate superconducting materials .",
    "we have evaluated the electric - field gradients at the cu and the o sites for a variety of cluster sizes and spin multiplicities . for both planar and apical oxygens a satisfactory agreement with the experimentally determined quadrupole frequencies was obtained . for copper ,",
    "a comparison between theoretical and experimental values is hampered by the uncertainty with which the cu nuclear quadrupole moments are known .    with respect to magnetic hyperfine properties",
    "one has to distinguish between the core - polarization and the dipolar contributions .",
    "the latter can be determined theoretically with good reliability .",
    "the former , however , is a quantity whose value is given by subtle cancellations of contributions from various s - like atomic orbitals .",
    "our calculations demonstrated that besides the negative on - site core - polarization for cu , a sizeable positive contribution transferred from neighboring cu@xmath2 ions exists as has been suggested by mila and rice  @xcite .",
    "we have investigated this transfer of spin density in detail and found that there is no appreciable contribution from copper ions other than the nearest neighbors .",
    "this is the main result of the present work since it has far reaching consequences .",
    "in particular , it questions the reconciliation between nmr and neutron scattering experiments and points out that the disagreements are now as before . by introducing a transferred hyperfine coupling between next - nearest neighbor cu spins and @xmath165o nuclei spin , zha et al .",
    "@xcite were able to conciliate many different experiments .",
    "we have shown that there is no microscopic justification for the presence of these additional hyperfine couplings .",
    "the discrepancies among the data therefore need another explanation .    on the other hand , the results of the analysis of the origins of the calculated hyperfine fields carried out in sec .",
    "[ origin ] shows that the spin densities on the coppers and oxygens are very tightly connected .",
    "this gives strong support for a one - component model of the spin fluid , at least as concerns ground - state properties .",
    "we have reached these conclusions by carrying out extended ab - initio cluster calculations .",
    "one has , of course , to take into consideration that this approach to describe the electronic structure emphasizes local features and is surely far more appropriate for insulating materials than for metals . it would be a big surprise , however , when a tight - binding picture completely failed to reproduce qualitative aspects of a system with itinerant charge carriers .",
    "this would shift the problems to a quite different field .",
    "the calculated values for the magnetic hyperfine couplings are in agreement with those extracted from various nmr and nqr experiments if we adopt the conventional estimates for the spin - orbit interaction for the cu@xmath2 ion . in this respect ,",
    "improved quantum chemical calculations of the spin - orbit coupling would be desirable .",
    "although our results give a small value for the hyperfine field that contributes to the spin part of the knight shift in c - direction ( @xmath166 ) , we think that the vanishing of @xmath167 below @xmath168 in all high - temperature superconductors and with all doping concentrations is still another open problem that deserves further experimental and theoretical consideration .",
