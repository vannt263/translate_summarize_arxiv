    "problems of learning with rank - based error metrics  @xcite and the adoption of learning for the purpose of rank aggregation in social choice  @xcite are gaining in prominence in recent years . in part , this is due to the explosion of socio - economic platforms , where opinions of users need to be aggregated ; e.g. , judges in crowd - sourcing contests , ranking of movies or user - generated content .    in the problem of social choice , users submit ordinal preferences consisting of partial or total ranks on the alternatives and a single rank order must be selected to be representative of the reports . since condorcet  @xcite ,",
    "one approach to this problem is to formulate social choice as the problem of estimating a true underlying world state ( e.g. , a true quality ranking of alternatives ) , where the individual reports are viewed as noisy data in regard to the true state . in this way",
    ", social choice can be framed as a problem of inference .",
    "in particular , condorcet assumed the existence of a true _ ranking _ over alternatives , with a voter s preference between any pair of alternatives @xmath0 generated to agree with the true ranking with probability @xmath1 and disagree otherwise .",
    "condorcet proposed to choose as the outcome of social choice the ranking that maximizes the likelihood of observing the voters preferences . later , kemeny s rule was shown to provide the maximum likelihood estimator ( mle ) for this model  @xcite .",
    "but condorcet s probabilistic model assumes identical and independent distributions on pairwise comparisons .",
    "this ignores the strength in agents preferences ( the same probability @xmath2 is adopted for all pairwise comparisons ) , and allows for cyclic preferences .",
    "in addition , computing the winner through the kemeny rule is @xmath3-complete  @xcite .    to overcome the first criticism , a more recent literature adopts the _ random utility model _ ( rum ) from economics  @xcite .",
    "consider @xmath4 alternatives . in rum",
    ", there is a ground truth utility ( or score ) associated with each alternative .",
    "these are real - valued parameters , denoted by @xmath5 . given this",
    ", an agent independently samples a random utility ( @xmath6 ) for each alternative @xmath7 with conditional distribution @xmath8 .",
    "usually @xmath9 is the mean of @xmath8",
    ". might be parameterized by other parameters , for example variance . ]",
    "let @xmath10 denote a permutation of @xmath11 , which naturally corresponds to a linear order : @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "slightly abusing notation , we also use @xmath10 to denote this linear order .",
    "random utility @xmath13 generates a distribution on preference orders , as @xmath14    the generative process is illustrated in figure  [ fig : rum ] .        0",
    "the systematic study of such models ( known as _ choice theory _ ) has been an important topic in psychology and economics since thurstone s seminal work in 1927  @xcite , which is well - known as the _ random utility theory _ in economics .    in social choice",
    "we have a set of _ alternatives _ , @xmath4 .",
    "adopting rums rules out cyclic preferences , because each agent s outcome corresponds to an order on real numbers , and it also captures the strength of preference , and thus overcomes the second criticism , by assigning a different parameter ( @xmath9 ) to each alternative .",
    "a popular rum is plackett - luce ( p - l )  @xcite , where the random utility terms are generated according to gumbel distributions with fixed shape parameter  @xcite . for p - l",
    ", the likelihood function has a simple analytical solution , making mle inference tractable .",
    "p - l has been extensively applied in econometrics  @xcite , and more recently in machine learning and information retrieval ( see  @xcite for an overview ) .",
    "efficient methods of em inference  @xcite , and more recently expectation propagation  @xcite , have been developed for p - l and its variants .    in application to social choice , the p - l model has been used to analyze political elections  @xcite .",
    "em algorithm has also been used to learn the _ mallows _ model , which is closely related to the condorcet s probabilistic model  @xcite .",
    "although p - l overcomes the two difficulties of the condorcet - kemeny approach , it is still quite restricted , by assuming that the random utility terms are distributed as gumbel , with each alternative is characterized by one parameter , which is the mean of its corresponding distribution .",
    "in fact , little is known about inference in rums beyond p - l .",
    "specifically , we are not aware of either an analytical solution or an efficient algorithm for mle inference for one of the most natural models proposed by thurstone  @xcite , where each @xmath6 is normally distributed .",
    "in this paper we focus on rums in which the random utilities are independently generated with respect to distributions in the _ exponential family _ ( ef )  @xcite .",
    "this extends the p - l model , since the gumbel distribution with fixed shape parameters belonging to the ef .",
    "our main theoretical contributions are theorem  [ thm1 ] and theorem  [ thm2 ] , which propose conditions such that the log - likelihood function is concave and the set of global maxima solutions is bounded for the _ location family _",
    ", which are rums where the shape of each distribution @xmath15 is fixed and the only latent variables are the locations , i.e. , the means of @xmath15 s .",
    "these results hold for existing special cases , such as the p - l model , and many other rums , for example the ones where each @xmath15 is chosen from normal , gumbel , laplace and cauchy .",
    "we also propose a novel application of mc - em .",
    "we treat the random utilities ( @xmath16 ) as latent variables , and adopt the expectation maximization ( em ) method to estimate parameters @xmath17 .",
    "the e - step for this problem is not analytically tractable , and for this we adopt a monte carlo approximation .",
    "we establish through experiments that the monte - carlo error in the e - step is controllable and does not affect inference , as long as numerical parameterizations are chosen carefully .",
    "in addition , for the e - step we suggest a parallelization over the agents and alternatives and a rao - blackwellized method , which further increases the scalability of our method .",
    "we generally assume that the data provides total orders on alternatives from voters , but comment on how to extend the method and theory to the case where the input preferences are _ partial _ orders .",
    "we evaluate our approach on synthetic data as well as two real - world datasets , a public election dataset and one involving rank preferences on sushi .",
    "the experimental results suggest that the approach is scalable despite providing significantly improved modeling flexibility over existing approaches .",
    "for the two real - world datasets we have studied , we compare rums with normal distributions and p - l in terms of four criteria : log - likelihood , predictive log - likelihood , akaike information criterion ( aic ) , and bayesian information criterion ( bic ) . we observe that when the amount of data is not too small , rums with normal distributions fit better than p - l .",
    "specifically , for the log - likelihood , predictive log - likelihood , and aic criteria , rums with normal distributions outperform p - l with 95% confidence in both datasets .",
    "in social choice , each agent @xmath18 has a strict preference order on alternatives .",
    "this provides the data for an inferential approach to social choice . in particular .",
    "let @xmath19 denote the set of all linear orders on @xmath20 .",
    "then , a _ preference - profile _ , @xmath21 , is a set of @xmath22 preference orders , one from each agent , so that @xmath23 .    a _ voting rule",
    "@xmath24 is a mapping that assigns to each preference - profile a set of winning rankings , @xmath25 . in particular , in the case of ties",
    "the set of winning rankings may include more than a singleton ranking . in the maximum likelihood ( mle )",
    "approach to social choice , 0    it is assumed that there is an unobserved ground truth , reflecting a true ranking of alternatives , and that each agent s preference order is drawn independently .",
    "the mle approach finds the ground truth that maximizes the probability of the preference profile ( as provided by the reports , or votes of participants ) .",
    "this estimated ground truth is then used to determine the winning alternative . for a preference - profile ( viewed as the the preference profile",
    "is viewed as _ data _ , @xmath26 .",
    "given this , the probability ( likelihood ) of the data given ground truth @xmath27 ( and for a particular @xmath28 ) is @xmath29 where , @xmath30 the mle approach to social choice selects as the winning ranking that which corresponds to the @xmath27 that maximizes @xmath31 . in the case of multiple parameters that maximize the likelihood",
    "then the mle approach returns a set of rankings , one ranking corresponding to each parameterization .    in this paper , we focus on probabilistic models where each @xmath15 belongs to the _ exponential family ( ef)_. the density function for each @xmath32 in ef has the following format : @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are functions of @xmath36 , @xmath37 is a function of @xmath38 , and @xmath39 denotes the sufficient statistics for @xmath38 , which could be multidimensional .    in the rum ,",
    "let @xmath15 s be gumbel distributions .",
    "that is , for alternative @xmath40 we have @xmath41 .",
    "then , we have : @xmath42 , where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46.this gives us the plackett - luce model .",
    "in this section , we provide a condition on distributions that guarantees that the likelihood function   is log - concave in parameters @xmath47 .",
    "we also provide a condition under which the set of mle solutions is bounded when any one latent parameter is fixed .",
    "together , this guarantees the convergence of our mc - em approach to a global mode with an accurate enough e - step .",
    "we focus on the _ location family _ , which is a subset of rums where the shapes of all @xmath15 s are fixed , and the only parameters are the means of the distributions . for the location family , we can write @xmath48 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 is a random variable whose mean is @xmath51 and models an agent s _ subjective noise_. the random variables @xmath52 s do not need to be identically distributed for all alternatives @xmath53 ; e.g. , they can be normal with different fixed variances .",
    "we focus on computing solutions ( @xmath47 ) to maximize the log - likelihood function , @xmath54    [ thm1 ] for the location family , if for every @xmath55 the probability density function for @xmath52 is log - concave , then @xmath56 is concave .",
    "the theorem is proved by applying the following lemma , which is theorem 9 in @xcite .",
    "[ thm9 ] suppose @xmath57 are concave functions in @xmath58 where @xmath17 is the vector of @xmath59 parameters and @xmath60 is a vector of @xmath59 real numbers that are generated according to a distribution whose pdf is logarithmic concave in @xmath61",
    ". then the following function is log - concave in @xmath61 .",
    "@xmath62    to apply lemma  [ thm9 ] , we define a set @xmath63 of function @xmath64 s that is equivalent to an order @xmath65 in the sense of inequalities implied by rum for @xmath65 and @xmath63 ( the joint probability in ( [ joint ] ) for @xmath63 to be the same as the probity of @xmath65 in rum with parameters @xmath17 ) .",
    "suppose @xmath66 for @xmath67 .",
    "then considering that the length of order @xmath65 is @xmath68 , we have : @xmath69    this is because @xmath70 is equivalent to that in @xmath65 alternative @xmath71 is preferred to alternative @xmath72 in the rum sense .    to see how this extends to the case where preferences are specified as partial orders , we consider in particular an interpretation where an agent s report for the ranking of @xmath73 alternatives implies that all other alternatives are worse for the agent , in some undefined order .",
    "given this , define @xmath66 for @xmath74 and @xmath75 for @xmath76 .",
    "considering that @xmath77s are linear ( hence , concave ) and using log concavity of the distributions of @xmath78 s , we can apply lemma  [ thm9 ] and prove log - concavity of the likelihood function .",
    "it is not hard to verify that pdfs for normal and gumbel are log - concave under reasonable conditions for their parameters , made explicit in the following corollary .",
    "for the location family where each @xmath52 is a normal distribution with mean zero and with fixed variance , or gumbel distribution with mean zeros and fixed shape parameter , @xmath56 is concave . specifically , the log - likelihood function for p - l is concave .",

    "using fact 3.5 .  in  @xcite ,",
    "the set of global maxima solutions to the likelihood function , denoted by @xmath79 , is convex since the likelihood function is log - concave .",

    "we next show that condition  [ cond1 ] is also a necessary and sufficient condition for the set of global maxima solutions @xmath79 to be bounded in location families , when we set one of the values @xmath9 to be @xmath51 ( w.l.o.g . ,  let @xmath85 ) .",

    "if condition  [ cond1 ] does not hold , then @xmath79 is unbounded because the parameters for all alternatives in @xmath89 can be increased simultaneously to improve the log - likelihood . for sufficiency",
    ", we first present the following lemma .",
    "[ lem1 ] if alternative @xmath53 is preferred to alternative @xmath90 in at least in one ranking then the difference of their mean parameters @xmath91 is bounded from above ( @xmath92 ) for all the @xmath17 that maximize the likelihood function .",

    "let @xmath99 .",
    "since the log - likelihood is always smaller than @xmath51 , it follows that for any @xmath100 and any @xmath101 , @xmath102 .",

    "therefore , there exists @xmath104 such that @xmath105 , where @xmath104 depends on the fixed @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "now consider a directed graph @xmath108 , where the nodes are the alternatives , and there is an edge between @xmath109 to @xmath110 if in at least one ranking @xmath111 . by condition  [ cond1 ] , for any pair @xmath112 , there is a path from @xmath109 to @xmath110 ( and conversely , a path from @xmath110 to @xmath7 ) . to see this , consider building a path between @xmath53 and @xmath90 by starting from a partition with @xmath113 and following an edge from @xmath53 to @xmath114 in the graph where @xmath114 is an alternatives in @xmath115 for which there must be such an edge , by condition  [ cond1 ] .",
    "consider the partition with @xmath116 , and repeat until an edge can be followed to vertex @xmath117 .",
    "it follows from lemma  [ lem1 ] that for any @xmath118 we have @xmath119 , using the telescopic sum of bounded values of the difference of mean parameters along the edges of the path , since the length of the path is no more than @xmath59 ( and tracing the path from @xmath53 to @xmath90 and @xmath90 to @xmath53 ) , meaning that @xmath79 is bounded .",
    "now that we have the log concavity and bounded property , we need to declare conditions under which the bounded convex space of estimated parameters corresponds to a unique order . the next theorem provides a necessary and sufficient condition for all global maxima to correspond to the same order on alternatives .",
    "suppose that we order the alternatives based on estimated @xmath36 s ( meaning that @xmath7 is ranked higher than @xmath110 iff @xmath120 ) .",
    "[ thm : sameorder ] the order over parameters is strict and is the same across all @xmath121 if , for all @xmath121 and all alternatives @xmath112 , @xmath122 .",

    "hence , if there is never a tie in the scores in any @xmath100 , then any vector in @xmath79 will reveal the unique order .",
    "in this section , we propose an mc - em algorithm for mle inference for rums where every @xmath15 belongs to the ef .. still , it seems hard to motivate the imposition of a prior on parameters in many social choice domains . ]",
    "the em algorithm determines the mle parameters @xmath17 iteratively , and proceeds as follows . in each iteration @xmath127 , given parameters @xmath128 from the previous iteration , the algorithm is composed of an e - step and an m - step . for the e - step , for any given @xmath129 , we compute the conditional expectation of the complete - data log - likelihood ( latent variables @xmath130 and data @xmath21 ) , where the latent variables @xmath130 are distributed according to data @xmath21 and parameters @xmath128 from the last iteration .    for the m - step , we optimize @xmath47 to maximize the expected log - likelihood computed in the e - step , and use it as the input @xmath131 for the next iteration : @xmath132      the e - step can be simplified using   as follows : @xmath133 @xmath134 where @xmath135 only depends on @xmath136 and @xmath21 ( not on @xmath47 ) , which means that it can be treated as a constant in the m - step .",
    "hence , in the e - step we only need to compute @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the sufficient statistic for the parameter @xmath9 in the model .",
    "we are not aware of an analytical solution for @xmath139 .",
    "however , we can use a monte carlo approximation , which involves sampling @xmath140 from the distribution @xmath141 using a gibbs sampler , and then approximates @xmath142 by @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the number of samples in the gibbs sampler .    in each step of our gibbs sampler for voter @xmath94",
    ", we randomly choose a position @xmath53 in @xmath65 and sample @xmath145 according to a _",
    "distribution @xmath146 , where @xmath147 . the truncatedef is obtained by truncating the tails of @xmath148 at @xmath149 and @xmath150 , respectively .",
    "for example , a truncated normal distribution is illustrated in figure  [ figretn ] .    ]    * rao - blackwellized * : to further improve the gibbs sampler , we use rao - blackwellized @xcite estimation using @xmath151 instead of the sample @xmath152 , where @xmath153 is all of @xmath154 except for @xmath152 .",
    "finally , we estimate @xmath151 in each step of the gibbs sampler using @xmath155 samples as @xmath156 where @xmath157 .",
    "rao - blackwellization reduces the variance of the estimator because of conditioning and expectation in @xmath151 .      in the e - step",
    "we have ( approximately ) computed @xmath158 . in the m - step",
    "we compute @xmath131 to maximize @xmath159 .",
    "equivalently , we compute @xmath160 for each @xmath55 separately to maximize @xmath161 .    for the case of the normal distribution with fixed variance , where @xmath162 and @xmath163 , we have @xmath164 . the algorithm is illustrated in figure  [ figalg ] .          in the last section we showed that if the rum satisfies the premise in theorem  [ thm1 ] and theorem  [ thm2 ] the data satisfies condition  [ cond1 ] , then the log - likelihood function is concave , and the set of global maxima solutions is bounded .",
    "this guarantee the convergence of mc - em for an exact e - step .",
    "in general , mc - em methods do not have the uniform convergence property of em methods . in order to control the error of approximation in the mc - e step",
    "we can increase the number of samples with the iterations  @xcite .",
    "however , in our application , we are not concerned with the exact estimation of @xmath17 , as we are only interested in their orders relative to each - other .",
    "therefore , as long as the approximation error remains relatively small , such that the differences of @xmath9s are much larger than the error , we are safe to stop .",
    "a known problem with gibbs sampling is that it can introduce correlation among samples . to address this",
    ", we sub - sample the samples to reduce the correlation , and call the ratio of sub - sampling the _ thinning factor _ ( @xmath165 ) .",
    "a suitable thinning ratio can be set using empirical results from the sampler .    with an approach similar to @xcite",
    ", we can derive a relationship between the variance of error in @xmath166 and the monte - carlo error in the e - step approximation : @xmath167 where @xmath144 is number of samples in gibbs sampler , @xmath155 is the number of samples for rao - blackwellization , @xmath22 is number of agents , @xmath168 is the thinning factor and @xmath169 , and samples @xmath170 are assumed to be independent",
    ". given , @xmath171 , @xmath172 and @xmath22 , we can make @xmath173 arbitrarily small by increasing @xmath174 .",
    "we evaluate the proposed mc - em algorithm on synthetic data as well as two real world data sets , namely an election data set and a dataset representing preference orders on sushi . for simulated data we use the kendall correlation  @xcite between two rank orders ( typically between the true order and the method s result ) as a measure of performance .",
    "we first generate data from normal models for the random utility terms , with means @xmath175 and equal variance for all terms , for different choices of variance ( @xmath176 ) .",
    "we evaluate the performance of the method as the number of agents @xmath22 varies .",
    "the results show that a limited number of iterations in the em algorithm ( at most 3 ) , and samples @xmath177 ( m=5 , n=800 ) are sufficient for inferring the order in most cases .",
    "the performance in terms of kendall correlation for recovering ground truth improves for larger number of agents , which corresponds to more data .",
    "see figure  [ figcomp ] , which shows the asymptotic behavior of the maximum likelihood estimator in recovering the true parameters .",
    "figure  [ figcomp ] left and middle panels show that the more the size of dataset the better the performance of the method .",

    "[ figcomp],scaledwidth=100.0% ]      we apply our method to a public election dataset collected by nicolaus tideman  @xcite , where the voters provided partial orders on candidates .",
    "a partial order includes comparisons among a subset of alternative , and the non - mentioned alternatives in the partial order are considered to be ranked lower than the lowest ranked alternative among mentioned alternatives .",
    "the total number of votes are @xmath180 and the number of alternatives @xmath181 . for the purpose of our experiments ,",
    "we adopt the order on alternatives obtained by applying our method on the entire dataset as an assumed ground truth , since no ground truth is given as part of the data . after finding the ground truth by using all 280 votes ( and adopting a normal model ) ,",
    "we compare the performance of our approach as we vary the amount of data available .",
    "we evaluate the performance for sub - samples consisting of @xmath182 of samples randomly chosen from the full dataset . for each sub - sample size , the experiment is repeated @xmath183 times and we report the average performance and the variance .",
    "see the right panel in figure  [ figcomp ] .",
    "this experiment shows the robustness of the method , in the sense that the result of inference on a subset of the dataset shows consistent behavior with the case that the result on the full dataset .",
    "for example , the ranking obtained by using half of the data can still achieve a fair estimate to the results with full data , with an average kendall correlation of greater than 0.4 .",
    "in addition to a public election dataset , we have tested our algorithm on a sushi dataset , where 5000 users give rankings over 10 different kinds of sushi  @xcite . for each experiment",
    "we randomly choose @xmath184 rankings , apply our mc - em for rums with normal distributions where variances are also parameters .    in the former experiments , both the synthetic data generation and the model for election data ,",
    "the variances were fixed to @xmath185 and hence we had the theoretical guarantees for the convergence to global optimal solutions by theorem  [ thm1 ] and theorem  [ thm2 ] . when we let the variances to be part of parametrization we lose the theoretical guarantees .",
    "however , the em algorithm can still be applied , and since the variances are now parameters ( rather than being fixed to @xmath185 ) , the model fits better in terms of log - likelihood .",
    "for this reason , we adopt rums with normal distributions in which the variance is a parameter that is fit by em along with the mean .",
    "we call this model a _ normal model_. we compute the difference between the normal model and p - l in terms of four criteria : log - likelihood ( ll ) , predictive log - likelihood ( predictive ll ) , aic , and bic . for (",
    "predictive ) log - likelihood , a positive value means that normal model fits better than p - l , whereas for aic and bic , a negative number means that normal model fits better than p - l .",
    "predictive likelihood is different from likelihood in the sense that we compute the likelihood of the estimated parameters for a part of the data that is not used for parameter estimation .",
    "in particular , we compute predictive likelihood for a randomly chosen subset of @xmath186 votes .",
