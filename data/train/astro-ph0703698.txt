    "a number of `` problems '' have been discussed in relation to the cosmic mean metallicity and/or mean metal density .",
    "pagel ( 1999 ) discussed the low redshift ( @xmath0@xmath10 ) `` excess metals problem '' showing that a comparison of the average metal to stellar densities in the low-@xmath0 universe indicates that the average cosmic stellar initial mass function ( imf ) has a higher yield , than what is obtained for the `` standard '' salpeter ( 1955 ) imf .",
    "this is a well known result for ellipticals in clusters ( e.g. , romeo 2006 and references therein ) , but pagel s analysis indicates that it could be more universal .",
    "conversely , pettini ( 1999 ) formulated the high-@xmath0 `` missing metals problem '' as follows : studies of the co - moving rest - frame uv luminosity density of high-@xmath0 lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) allow us to trace the cosmic star formation density ( or history , sfh ) , @xmath13 , up to redshifts @xmath14 . assuming an imf of such stars",
    ", one can compute the specific fraction of heavy elements ( `` metals '' ) they produce , @xmath15 , and derive the metal production rate @xmath16 .",
    "the integral from @xmath17 gives , at any given @xmath0 , the density of cosmic metals @xmath18 , or , expressed in units of the critical density , @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , if one restricts the analysis to elements , such as the @xmath9-elements , produced almost exclusively in massive stars undergoing core collapse , the apparent dependence of @xmath18 on the imf is essentially removed , since both the uv light and the oxygen production originate from massive stars . this will be discussed further in section  [ sect : uv ] , and was already noticed by , e.g. , songaila ( 1990 ) , madau ( 1996 ) , pagel ( 1999 ) and pettini ( 1999 ) .",
    "early searches in cosmic structures for which the metal / baryon mass ratio ( metallicity , @xmath20 ) can be derived either via intergalactic gas quasar absorption line experiments ( dlas or the ly@xmath9 `` forest '' ) or through direct spectroscopic studies of lyman break galaxies have found that only @xmath21 is stored in these components , the large majority of the metals are `` missing '' .",
    "similar missing metal problems have been formulated by wolfe ( 2003 ) and prochaska ( 2003 , 2006 ) on the basis of star formation rates and metallicities of dlas alone .",
    "ferrara ( 2005 , fsb05 ) attempted to quantify more precisely the extent of the missing metals deficit , and also to suggest where the `` missing metals '' might be found .",
    "they found from considering typical stellar masses and metallicities of lyman break galaxies , and an estimate of the co - moving density of lbgs a contribution of @xmath22 from lyman break galaxies .",
    "they also estimated the contribution from metals in dlas to about @xmath23 . using the sfh estimate of bouwens ( 2004b ) , assuming a salpeter imf , and applying a dust correction factor of 4.5 ( reddy & steidel 2004 ) they estimated that the universe should be characterised by a total metallicity density of @xmath24 at @xmath0=2.3 . from the above numbers they concluded that about 80% of the metals in the universe are missing , in the sense that they are not directly associated with the above two galactic components .",
    "fsb05 suggested that the `` missing metals '' are associated with galaxies , mainly residing in their `` hot '' gas halos , having been deposited there by star - burst driven super - winds ( see also pettini 2004 ) .",
    "this hypothesis seems reasonable , given that outflow velocities of 300 - 400 km / s are routinely inferred from the spectra of lbgs ( e.g. , pettini 2001 , shapley 2003 ) .",
    "moreover , semi - analytical as well as fully hydrodynamical models of galaxy formation , based on cold dark matter ( cdm ) , require such `` feedback '' in order to enable the formation of realistic galaxies , solving the `` over - cooling '' , `` angular momentum '' , `` missing satellites '' and other problems ( e.g. , sommer - larsen 1999 , cole 2001 , thacker & couchman 2001 , sommer - larsen 2003 , sgp03 ) .    considering the widely used probes of ly@xmath9 forest metal absorption in qso spectra , and ( e.g. , songaila 2001 , bergeron 2002 , carswell 2002 , boksenberg , sargent & rauch 2003 , schaye 2003 , simcoe 2004 , aracil 2004 , scannapieco 2005 ; and bergeron & herbert - fort 2005 , tripp 2006 ) , fsb05 inferred observed integrated and column densities over the redshift range 1.7@xmath25@xmath0@xmath253.8 , and the corresponding cosmic average densities of these . assuming a two - phase intergalactic medium ( igm ) , consisting of a `` cold '' part ( @xmath2@xmath110@xmath26k ) , responsible for the hydrogen ly@xmath9 forest absorption , and a `` hot '' component ( @xmath2@xmath110@xmath27k )",
    ", they showed , using a number of simplifying assumptions , that more than 90% of the metals can reside in the hot component , without violating the and ly@xmath9 forest metallicity constraints ( and with the cold phase as the major contributor to the and column densities ) .",
    "this result follows provided that @xmath2810@xmath29k , and the density of the hot metal - enriched gas is only factors of a few times the mean cosmic baryonic density , which , e.g. , at @xmath0=3 , corresponds to a hydrogen number density of @xmath6@xmath11.2@xmath3010@xmath31@xmath8 .",
    "fsb05 suggest this metal containing gas to be identified as wind - blown galaxy halo gas .",
    "the low luminosity galaxies at high redshift are traced by the dlas ( e.g. fynbo 1999 ; haehnelt 2000 , schaye 2001a ; mller 2002 ) . from very early on it",
    "was found that dlas contain different regions with very different temperatures and ionisation states ( turnshek et al .",
    "the dla metal content discussed by fsb05 only accounts for the cold , mainly neutral component .",
    "the and lines in dlas corresponds to a warmer phase with more turbulent kinematics .",
    "the cross - section for strong and absorption is much larger than for dlas consistent with the picture that this gas is located in an extended wind - blown halo around the stellar components ( petitjean & bergeron 1994 , see also adelberger 2003 , 2005 , porciani & madau 2005 , scannapieco 2005 )",
    ". an even hotter component , traced by and ( temperatures of order @xmath32 k ) , has recently been identified in dlas ( fox 2007 ) .",
    "fox find that if the temperature of the bearing gas is 10@xmath27 k or higher , then this hot phase can contribute significantly to the metal mass budget  qualitatively consistent with the proposal of fsb05 .",
    "bouch ( 2006a , b ) discussed the missing metals problem at @xmath0@xmath12.2 - 2.5 and found that the problem is not quite as severe as at @xmath0@xmath13 . counting metal contributions from stars in bx galaxies ( the equivalent of lbgs at @xmath0=2.2 ; e.g. , adelberger 2004 ) and drgs ( `` distant red galaxies '' ; e.g. , franx 2003 , van dokkum 2003 ) , as well as from gas in smgs ( sub - millimeter galaxies ; e.g. , blain 2004 , greve 2005 ) and dlas ( e.g. , pettini 2003 ) they could account for about 1/3 of the metals expected .",
    "the bx galaxies contain the largest fraction of the identified metals , about 55% .",
    "moreover , bouch ( 2007 ) found that another about 1/3 of the metals expected can be identified in the igm at such redshifts .",
    "recently , dav & oppenheimer ( 2006 , do06 ) modeled the enrichment history of the universe and address the missing metals problem using a fully numerical approach .",
    "they perform a moderate resolution cosmological hydro / gravity simulation of a cubic region of the universe of 32 @xmath33mpc box size .",
    "their simulation invokes metallicity and uv background dependent radiative cooling , star - formation and chemical evolution , in the instantaneous recycling approximation , and based on the salpeter imf .",
    "the simulation resolves galaxies of stellar masses down to @xmath110@xmath34 @xmath35 , corresponding to a v - band absolute magnitude @xmath36@xmath37 at @xmath0@xmath13 . due to the limited resolution",
    ", the authors adopt a parameterized description of star - burst driven outflows in the form of a `` momentum - driven '' wind , found by oppenheimer & dav ( 2006 , od06 ) to yield the best match of the results of their simulations to various observational data .",
    "do06 quantify their results in terms of cosmic metal fractions in five phases : a ) stars , b ) star - forming gas , c ) halo gas ( gas inside of the virial radius of galaxy halos , which is not star - forming ) , d ) shocked igm ( gas outside of galaxy halos of @xmath2@xmath123@xmath3010@xmath26 k ) , and e ) diffuse igm ( gas outside of galaxy halos of @xmath2@xmath253@xmath3010@xmath26 k ) . at @xmath0@xmath13 , they find that the dominant metal phase is the diffuse igm , which contains about 40% of the cosmic metals , with the other four phases containing approximately equal fractions of about 15% .",
    "hence , do06 find that indeed only about 20% of the metals in the @xmath0@xmath13 universe reside in stars , while the `` missing '' about 80% are located in the gas phase .",
    "moreover , they find that the hot halo gas is not the dominant , metal containing phase . instead , a large fraction of the missing metals are `` hidden '' in the diffuse igm .",
    "do06 suggest that this is possible , in relation to observations of , e.g. , low density igm abundances , because the diffuse gas is somewhat hotter than assumed in previous estimates , which at gas over - densities of @xmath38@xmath39 implies larger to c ionisation corrections , and hence that larger amounts of c can be `` hidden '' in this phase .    in this paper",
    "we take another approach from that of do06 ( see also calura & matteucci 2004 , 2006 ) .",
    "as we will show in the paper , due to resolution limitations do06 likely fail to account for about half of the metals in the universe produced by @xmath0@xmath13 , on top of which adds cosmic variance effects , given the relatively small computational box of do06 . to undertake simulations of larger cosmological volumes , at the same time probing 8 - 10 magnitudes deeper ( sec .",
    "[ sect : cosmic ] ) is at present , as well as in any foreseeable future , computationally prohibitive .",
    "using k - band observations of a sample of lbgs , shapley ( 2001 ) determined the @xmath0@xmath13 rest - frame v - band galaxy luminosity function . in sommer - larsen & fynbo ( 2007 , paper  i ) we correct the shapley luminosity function for extinction and other effects , to obtain a `` true '' @xmath0@xmath13 lyman break galaxy lf",
    "subsequently , cosmological high - resolution hydro / gravity simulations of the formation and evolution of individual galaxies are combined with the corrected galaxy luminosity function to obtain estimates of the average cosmic density of metals ( in particular oxygen ) residing in stars at @xmath0=3 .",
    "we consider models based on three different stellar imfs , spanning almost a factor of five in chemical yield as well as thermal / kinetic energy feedback from supernova type ii ( snii ) explosions .",
    "these are the kroupa ( 1998 , k98 ) imf , a typical imf suited for chemical evolution models of the solar neighbourhoohd , e.g. , boissier & prantzos ( 1999 ) , the `` standard '' salpeter ( 1955 , s ) imf and the arimoto - yoshii ( 1987 , ay ) imf , which is well suited for describing the chemical evolution of elliptical galaxies .",
    "the simulations have sufficiently high resolution to allow a two - phase modeling of the star - forming interstellar medium ( ism ) , consisting of a `` cold '' @xmath2@xmath110@xmath26 k star - forming phase and a `` hot '' @xmath2@xmath110@xmath40- 10@xmath27 k phase , intermixed with the cold gas .",
    "star - bursts drive galactic winds by depositing thermal energy from multiple snii explosions in the gas , part of which is subsequently converted into kinetic energy self - consistently by the hydro - code .    in paper",
    "i we conclude that for none of the imfs is it possible to reconcile the amount of oxygen locked in stars with the amount predicted from the ( observed ) cosmic uv luminosity density history , hence confirming the `` missing metals problem '' as stated by pettini ( 1999 ) and fsb05 .",
    "in this paper we combine the high - resolution galaxy formation models with the v - band luminosity function to determine the cosmologically averaged amount and properties of @xmath0=3 gas - phase metals , mostly focusing on oxygen , but also on carbon , in particular in relation to qso absorption line determinations of the cosmic density , as well as iron , in relation to dla abundances . combining the results obtained with those of paper",
    "i the total cosmic metal distribution is obtained for the three imfs considered .",
    "comparing in turn these results to inferences from the observed cosmic uv luminosity density history allows us to significantly constrain the `` true '' cosmic stellar imf .",
    "finally , relations to the `` missing metals problem '' , as well as results obtained by other authors , are discussed .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section  [ sect : uv ] we derive constraints on cosmic metal production from the cosmic uv luminosity density history , in section  [ sect : simulations ] we briefly describe the hydro / gravity galaxy formation simulations , and in sections  [ sect : approach ] and [ sect : cosmic ] we present the approach used in this paper to determine the temperature distribution of the cosmic gas - phase metals .",
    "section  [ sect : civ ] presents results on gas - phase abundances , and , relating these to observations of absorption lines in qso spectra , we derive a constraint on the cosmic imf . in section  [",
    "sect : comb ] we combine the results of paper i and those obtained here to derive the total cosmic metal distribution . comparing this",
    "to what is obtained from the cosmic uv luminosity density history we obtain an additional constraint on the cosmic stellar imf . in section  [",
    "sect : mm ] we relate our results to the `` missing metals problem '' and compare them to those of other workers in the field , in section  [ sect : numres ] we demonstrate that our results are robust to changes of the numerical resolution and , finally , section  [ sect : conclusions ] summarises our conclusions .    in the paper",
    "we assume the flat @xmath41 cosmology , with @xmath42 = 0.3 and @xmath43=0.7 , and @xmath44 km / s / mpc , with @xmath45=0.7 , unless it is explicitly stated otherwise .",
    "constraints on metal production from the cosmic uv luminosity density history are discussed in paper  i , but for coherence we present the main discussion in the following as well .",
    "the luminosity of young galaxies at rest - frame @xmath461500  is a measure of the rate of formation of massive stars ( mainly o and b type ) as shown by , e.g. , madau ( 1998 ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath9-elements like oxygen are almost exclusively produced in such massive stars , and hence there is a direct link between the cosmic average oxygen production rate density and the average uv luminosity density , which is essentially independent of the stellar initial mass function  see , e.g. , pettini ( 1999 ) . to estimate the cosmic oxygen production rate density as a function of redshift we use various recent estimates of the average cosmic star formation rate .",
    "the estimates have been obtained from steidel ( 1999 ) , bouwens ( 2004a , b ) , bunker ( 2004 ) , giavalisco ( 2004 ) , schimonovich ( 2005 ) , bouwens ( 2006 ) and sawicki & thompson ( 2006 ) .",
    "the estimates used are all based on assuming a `` standard '' salpeter imf in converting from uv luminosity to star formation rate . the oxygen ( mass ) yield of a salpeter imf is 0.01 ( e.g. , lia 2002a , b )  hence in fig .",
    "[ fig : ofr ] we have multiplied the published sfrs by 0.01 to obtain the ( essentially ) imf independent oxygen production rate densities .",
    "the estimates have moreover been corrected to correspond to ( at any redshift ) the uv luminosity density of galaxies brighter than 0.1@xmath47 following an approach similar to that of bouwens ( 2006 ; note though that the @xmath0@xmath17.5 data point of bouwens 2004b only represents @xmath480.3@xmath47 ) .",
    "finally , the values shown in the plot result from multiplying the observed values by a dust - correction factor of 5.5 .",
    "this value is intermediate between the @xmath493 values of 4.5 and 6.5 suggested by reddy & steidel ( 2004 ) and dahlen ( 2007 ) , respectively ( but see below ) .",
    "the cosmic average oxygen density at @xmath0=3 can now be obtained by integrating the oxygen production rate density , @xmath50 , from @xmath0=3 and back in time .",
    "we shall consider three models for @xmath50 : the `` median '' model , the `` maximum '' model , and the `` minimum '' model .",
    "the median model is obtained by calculating the median values of @xmath51 in the bins @xmath0=3 to 4 and @xmath0= 4 to 6 ( assigning equal weight to each data point , but excluding the @xmath0=5.9 value of bunker 2004 ; see below ) , and connecting these values with the @xmath527.5 value of bouwens ( 2004b ) . this model",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ofr ] by the long - dashed curve .",
    "the maximum model is obtained by connecting the @xmath0=3 to 4 median value with the giavalisco ( 2004 ) @xmath525.7 value , and the bouwens ( 2004b ) @xmath526.0 value , and multiplying the resulting `` upper envelope '' by a factor 6.5/5.5 to maximize also the dust correction .",
    "this model is shown by the upper short - dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : ofr ] .",
    "finally , the minimum model is obtained by connecting the @xmath0=3 to 4 median value with the giavalisco ( 2004 ) @xmath524.8 value , the bouwens ( 2004a ) value and the bouwens ( 2006 ) @xmath527.5 value , and multiplying this `` lower envelope '' by a factor 4.5/5.5 to minimize the dust correction ( but see below ) .",
    "this model is shown by the lower short - dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : ofr ] .    assuming a flat space world model , the @xmath0=3 cosmic average oxygen density can now be evaluated as @xmath53 @xmath54 where values of @xmath44 km / s / mpc , with @xmath45=0.7 , @xmath42 = 0.3 and @xmath43=0.7 are assumed in this paper . using eq.1",
    "we obtain @xmath55=3 ) = 0.32 , 0.42 and 0.56 @xmath56 @xmath35/(@xmath33mpc)@xmath57 for the `` minimum '' , `` medium '' and `` maximum '' models , respectively .",
    "these numbers represent an integral constraint that any successful model of galaxy formation must meet .",
    "as will be shown in section  [ sect : cosmic ] this enables us to strongly constrain the `` cosmic '' stellar imf at @xmath583 .    in determining the `` median '' and `` minimum '' models we excluded the @xmath0=5.9 value of bunker ( 2004 ) .",
    "this is simply done on the basis of the large discrepancy between this value , and all other @xmath0=4 to 6 values . to indicate the effect of this",
    ", we determined an alternative median model in which the bunker ( 2004 ) value is included in the @xmath0=4 to 6 bin .",
    "this changed the median model estimate of @xmath55=3 ) from 0.42 to 0.40 @xmath56 @xmath35/(@xmath33mpc)@xmath57 , i.e. a @xmath12 % change , and hence quite small effect , which , given all other uncertainties , we shall ignore in the following .",
    "bouwens ( 2006 ) propose that the @xmath461350 - 1500  extinction correction decreases with increasing @xmath0 from @xmath493 .",
    "converting their proposed , extinction - corrected sfr(@xmath0 ) to a corresponding @xmath50 ( including changing the uv luminosity density from their limit of 0.04@xmath47 to the limit of 0.1@xmath47 used here ) results in a value of @xmath55=3 ) = 0.33 @xmath56 @xmath35/(@xmath33mpc)@xmath57 , hence within the bounds derived above .",
    "the integral constraint obtained in this section can also be expressed in units of the critical density : we obtain @xmath59(@xmath0=3 ) = @xmath55=3)/@xmath60 = 0.81 , 1.05 and 1.41@xmath61 for the minimum , median and maximum models , respectively .",

    "the above value translates into @xmath59(@xmath0=2.3 ) = ( 0.77@xmath630.14)@xmath61 .",
    "if the oxygen density production rate models shown in fig .  [ fig : ofr ] are continued @xmath0=2.3 , we would obtain 1.22 , 1.55 and 2.01 @xmath61 .",
    "the reason for the apparent discrepancy is two - fold : a ) we use a dust correction of a factor of 5.5 , and b ) more importantly , the bouwens ( 2004b ) sfh was based on a uv luminosity to a limit of 0.3@xmath47 , rather than the limit of 0.1@xmath47 adopted in this work . using the @xmath64 uv luminosity function of adelberger & steidel ( 2000 )",
    "we estimate the latter correction to be a factor of 1.5 .",
    "multiplying this by a factor of 5.5/4.5 the findings of fsb05 would translate into about ( 1.4@xmath630.3)@xmath61 , in good agreement with our values above .",
    "extremely dust - obscured galaxies such as high-@xmath0 scuba sources ( e.g. , smail 1997 ; barger 1998 ; eales 1999 ; chapman 2005 ) are not included in the dust - corrected star formation rate densities shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : ofr ] .",
    "most such galaxies have uv luminosities that heavily under - represent their star formation rates and thus such galaxies are not properly included in the estimate of the oxygen production rate density .",
    "their numbers may be sufficiently large that their contribution is significant , however we neglect this contribution for two reasons : a ) the contribution from such galaxies would be largest at @xmath0@xmath12 , where the redshift distribution of scuba sources appears to peak ( chapman 2005 , reddy 2005 ) , whereas we are concerned with the range @xmath0@xmath73 , and b ) more importantly , we are concerned with the oxygen production rate density history of lyman break galaxies _ only _ , as we wish to compare the integral constraint thus obtained to results of combining the observed lbg @xmath0@xmath13 optical rest - frame luminosity function with detailed , high - resolution models of galaxy formation .",
    "the code used for the simulations is a significantly improved version of the treesph code we used for our previous work on galaxy formation ( sgp03 ) .",
    "a similar version of the code has been used recently to simulate clusters of galaxies , and a detailed description can be found in romeo ( 2006 ) .",
    "here we briefly mention its main features and the upgrades over the previous version of sgp03  see also sommer - larsen ( 2006 ) .    1",
    ".   the basic equations are integrated by incorporating the `` conservative '' entropy equation solving scheme of springel & hernquist ( 2002 ) , which improves the numerical accuracy in lower resolution regions .",
    "cold high - density gas is turned into stars in a probabilistic way as described in sgp03 . in a star - formation event",
    "an sph particle is converted fully into a star particle .",
    "non - instantaneous recycling of gas and heavy elements is described through probabilistic `` decay '' of star particles back to sph particles as discussed by lia ( 2002a ) . in a decay event",

    "non - instantaneous chemical evolution tracing 10 elements ( h , he , c , n , o , mg , si , s , ca and fe ) has been incorporated in the code following lia ( 2002a , b ) ; the algorithm includes supernov  of type ii and type ia , and mass loss and chemical enrichment from stars of all masses .",
    "most of the simulations presented in this paper have been undertaken using three different initial mass functions : the kroupa ( 1998 ) imf ( denoted k98 in the following ) , derived for field stars in the solar neighborhood , the standard salpeter imf ( s ) , and the more top - heavy arimoto & yoshii ( 1987 ) imf ( ay ) , which is well suited for the modeling of elliptical galaxies , as well as galaxy clusters .",

    "is implemented , depending both on the metallicity of the gas ( sutherland & dopita 1993 ) and on the meta  galactic uv field , modeled after haardt & madau ( 1996 ) . moreover ,",
    "a simplified treatment of radiative transfer , switching off the uv field where the gas becomes optically thick to lyman limit photons on scales of @xmath1 1  kpc , is invoked .",
    "star - burst driven winds are incorporated in the simulations at early epochs ( @xmath0@xmath75 - 6 ) , as strong early feedback is crucial to largely overcome the angular momentum problem ( sgp03 ) .",
    "a burst of star formation is modeled in the same way as in sgp03 : when a star particle is formed , further self - propagating star formation is triggered in the surroundings ; the energy from the resulting , correlated snii explosions is released initially into the interstellar medium as thermal energy , and gas cooling is locally halted to reproduce the adiabatic super ",
    "shell expansion phase ; a fraction of the supplied energy is subsequently converted ( by the hydro code itself ) into kinetic energy of the resulting expanding super  winds and/or shells .",
    "the super  shell expansion also drives the dispersion of the metals produced by type  ii supernov  ( while metals produced on longer timescales are restituted to the gaseous phase by the `` decay '' of the corresponding star particles , see point 2 above ) .",
    "+ at later epochs , only a fraction ( typically , 20% ) of the stars induce efficient feedback , and star formation is no longer self  propagating so that no strong star - bursts are triggered by correlated sn explosions .",
    "this allows the smooth settling of the disc ( see sgp03 for all details ) .",
    "star formation efficiencies have been chosen such that realistic disc galaxy gas fractions result at @xmath0=0 ( sgp03 ) , and can also be shown to match the kennicutt ( 1998 ) star formation relation quite well .",
    "+ agn driven feedback has not been invoked in the simulations , as it is unlikely to play a major role in the formation of , at least , disc galaxies ( e.g. , sommer - larsen 2006 )  the most common galaxy type in the universe .",
    "the higher stellar uv escape fractions as well as lyc luminosities found by razoumov & sommer - larsen ( 2007 ) at @xmath65 , compared to @xmath66 , also support the notion that massive stars in galaxies become progressively more important sources of ionizing photons as one goes back in time , as the comoving number density of quasars declines rapidly at @xmath67 ( e.g. , richards 2006 ) .",
    "this provides additional circumstantial evidence that agn feedback is of minor importance , at least at @xmath68 , the relevant redshift range in this paper .",

    "the warm / hot to cold gas - phase oxygen mass ratios are for this lf 0.8 , 1.1 and 2.1 for the k98 , salpeter and ay imfs , respectively . moreover , for the ay imf",
    ", the hot to cold / warm gas - phase oxygen mass ratio is unity .    an obvious question is now : for the different gas temperatures , which galaxies contribute mainly to the cosmic gas - phase oxygen budget ? in fig .",
    "[ fig : cosmic_abunt_m_v ] this is shown using the modified shapley luminosity function , for the k98 and ay imfs , respectively .",
    "it is seen that for the k98 imf the main contribution to the @xmath79=4.5 phase comes from small galaxies , @xmath126 , and for the ay imf this is the case for the @xmath79=5 and 5.5 phases as well ( the reason for the large difference between the @xmath36-distributions of @xmath79=4 and @xmath79=4.5 , say , gas - phase metals is that , whereas the @xmath79=4 gas is of fairly high density and associated with all galaxies , @xmath79=4.5 gas is typically diffuse and associated with halos of comparable virial temperature , i.e. fairly small galaxies ) .",
    "given this , and in relation to observational studies , it is clearly of interest to determine how large a fraction of the gas - phase oxygen is associated with galaxies to a certain limiting magnitude . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ocum ] this is shown by the long - dashed curves ( for the three imfs considered ) for the @xmath121 and @xmath127 lfs .",

    "the corresponding fraction is about 30% .",
    "hence , most of the cosmic gas - phase oxygen is associated with galaxies considerably fainter than @xmath128 , and is also in this sense `` missing '' .    in calculating the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ocum ] it has been assumed that the observational lfs maintain a constant faint end slope down to @xmath130 . as can be seen from the figure ,",

    "moreover , we note that neither the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) @xmath137 local luminosity function ( norberg 2002 ) , nor the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) u - band local luminosity function ( baldry 2005 ) show any flattening of the faint end slope to 5 - 6 magnitudes fainter than @xmath138 . moreover , some galaxy cluster luminosity functions tend to show a _ steepening _ faint end slope : milne ( 2007 ) find a steepening of the slope in the coma cluster at a @xmath139 range of about @xmath113 to @xmath140 , and yamanoi ( 2007 ) find a similar result for the hydra i cluster .    given the significance of the results obtained in this section on the distribution of cosmic gas - phase metals , it is important to consider the following two sources of potential model dependence .",
    "first , it is possible that the results depend on the specific choice of `` base '' galaxies .",
    "we verified explicitly , however , that choices of alternative sets of isolated sets of `` base '' galaxies , and subsequently going through the procedure described in the previous section , lead to very similar results as the ones described here .",
    "hence , the results presented are very robust to this .",
    "second , it would be expected that the amount of ( in particular ) @xmath79=4 cold gas and metal mass available in a simulation at any given time would depend on the star - formation efficiency adopted ( sec .",

    "this may seem inconsistent with our use of the haardt & madau ( 1996 ) uvb in the cosmological simulations , but as shown by croft ( 1998 ) , because photo - ionisation is sub - dominant in gas dynamics such a correction yields virtually identical results as having done the simulations with the above ( reduced ) background .",

    "however , proto - cluster regions are very special sites , and , as can be seen from the results of the previous section , the contribution to the cosmic metal production associated with the very luminous galaxies typical of such regions , @xmath155 , is very small ( in the proto - cluster regions containing 100 - 200 galaxies , almost half of the gas - phase metals are associated with five galaxies of @xmath156 ) . also shown in the figure",

    "the observational estimates were taken from songaila ( 2001 ) , boksenberg , sargent & rauch ( 2003 ) and songaila ( 2005 ) .",

    "hence , our result above on the cosmic imf should be seen as indicative only .",

    "summarising , one of the main results obtained in this paper is that galaxy formation models based on the kroupa ( 1998 ) imf ( and any other imf of similar chemical yield ) are strongly excluded by the cosmic enrichment history constraint .",
    "other arguments , why the average cosmic imf must have a larger chemical yield than what is typical for a solar neighborhood one , have been given by , e.g. , portinari ( 2004 ) , dantona & caloi ( 2004 ) , serjeant & harrison ( 2005 ) , lucatello ( 2005 ) , loewenstein ( 2006 ) , prantzos & charbonnel ( 2006 ) and weidner & kroupa ( 2006 ) , but see also elmegreen ( 2006 ) .",
    "perhaps even more interestingly , models based on the salpeter imf , the arguably most extensively used model of the stellar imf , are also excluded , though the @xmath122 models only marginally so . given that the salpeter imf is routinely used in translating uv luminosities into star formation rates for high redshift galaxies , this is also an important result .",
    "although it would be inappropriate to assign a high statistical significance to this result , given all the uncertainties involved , it is obvious from fig .  [",
    "fig : cumodens ] that the models based on the more top - heavy arimoto - yoshii imf provide a much better match to the median value for the integral constraint .",

    "we can not compare the results found in the previous sections directly to theirs , since different gas - phase criteria have been used .",
    "however , our @xmath79=4.5 gas criterion is similar to theirs for diffuse igm , though we also include @xmath79=4.5 metals inside of galaxy virial radii in our estimate ( see also below ; note also that we find almost all the @xmath79=4 phase metals to reside in gas of fairly high density , @xmath6@xmath70.1 @xmath8 , so there is essentially no overlap between this phase and do06 s diffuse phase ) .    for the @xmath121 lf",

    "if we use the proto - cluster regions , which are the only simulations at our disposal with a resolution comparable to the ( fairly modest ) numerical resolution of do06 s 32 @xmath33mpc box size simulation , the corresponding fractions drop to @xmath11% for all imfs .",
    "however , we stress that the temperature of the proto - cluster igm is larger than that of the average igm , but in any case significantly lower `` diffuse igm '' metal fractions , than predicted by do06 , are indicated .",
    "do06 used the springel & hernquist ( 2003 ) `` sub - grid '' approach to model star - formation .",

    "this result is strongly at variance with our results , and it would seem difficult for such models to match the large amount of dla cross section observationally detected at such redshifts , although further analysis obviously is required to clarify this .    finally , we can compare the @xmath0=3 gas phase metal temperature distribution predicted by do06 to our results .",
    "qualitatively , our predictions for the k98 and salpeter imfs agree with that of do06 , in yielding temperature distributions , which peak at @xmath2@xmath1@xmath191 k and decrease towards larger temperatures .",
    "however , for the ay imf the results are very different . moreover , quantitatively our results for the k98 and salpeter imfs disagree significantly with those of do06 at the `` high-@xmath2 '' end : do06 find that @xmath1185% of the gas - phase metals reside in gas of @xmath2@xmath83@xmath193 k. in comparison , we find for the @xmath121 lf that the corresponding fractions are 20 , 32 and 51% for the k98 , salpeter and ay imfs , respectively , and for the @xmath122 lf , 21 , 32 and 50% .",
    "hence for any of the imfs considered , we predict significantly larger fractions of `` high-@xmath2 '' gas - phase metals , than do do06 .      the @xmath79=4 phase is found to be the most prominent metal containing gas - phase for the k98 and salpeter imfs , and also to be quite prominent for the ay imf . as the metals in this phase typically reside in gas of densities @xmath192@xmath70.1 @xmath8 , one would expect a significant fraction of these metals to be situated at column densities typical of dlas , viz .",

    ", we predict similar to three times as large amounts of metals in the @xmath79=4 phase ( depending on the imf ) , whereas observations of dlas only indicate a fraction of about 10 - 20% ( e.g. , fsb05 , prochaska 2006 ) .",
    "it is obviously of importance to understand the reason for this apparent discrepancy .",
    "although we will defer a thorough discussion of dlas to a forthcoming paper ( sommer - larsen 2007 ) , we briefly address the above issue in the following .",
    "ellison ( 2007 ) analysed two of the very high resolution simulations , described in the following section , in relation to dla properties .",
    "the two simulations represent the formation and evolution of two disc galaxies , of @xmath0=0 characteristic circular velocities @xmath195=245 and 180 km / s .",
    "the galaxies were selected from a larger sample to represent two different disc formation evolutionary paths : for the @xmath195=180 km / s galaxy the disc starts growing steadily already by @xmath0@xmath12.5 , whereas for the other galaxy disc growth is merger induced , and the disc grows strongly from @xmath0@xmath11 to 0 ( see also robertson 2004 ) .",
    "ellison determined the dla / sub - dla characteristics of these two proto - galaxies at @xmath0=3.6 , 3.0 and 2.3 , with focus on determining neutral column density distributions , and the probability of detecting coincident 100 kpc - scale dla / sub - dla absorption in individual galaxies at such redshifts  we refer the reader to ellison for more detail , as well as images of the objects .    here",
    "we build on the analysis by ellison of these two ( proto-)galaxies . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dla ] ( left ) we show the normalised cumulative oxygen mass in the absorber above log(n(hi))=20.3 versus the cumulative absorber area , starting at the highest hi surface densities , log(n(hi))@xmath124 , and going down to log(n(hi))=20.3 .",
    "for each galaxy results for `` face - on '' and one `` edge - on '' projections are shown .",
    "as can be seen , about 90% of the total oxygen mass of the absorber resides in 1% of the total absorber area for both projections . from fig .",
    "[ fig : dla ] ( center ) it is moreover seen that this oxygen mass is associated with column densities log(n(hi))@xmath722.5 .",
    "dlas of such high column densities have never been detected in qso spectra , which of course is not surprising given the above findings .",
    "moreover , at such high densities , formation of molecular hydrogen is likely to take place ( schaye 2001b ; zwaan & prochaska 2006 ) .",
    "although the process of h@xmath82 formation is not included in the hydro / gravity simulations , it is clear that the properties of the high density gas can be significantly affected by h@xmath82 formation ( e.g. , pelupessy 2006 ) .",
    "greve & sommer - larsen ( 2007 ) showed that the effects of h@xmath82 formation can be approximately determined post - process on the basis of the cosmological galaxy formation simulations  this will be one of the main topics of a forthcoming paper on dlas ( sommer - larsen 2007 ) .",
    "molecules have been detected in dlas , but only at relatively low fractions of less than a tenth relative to atomic hydrogen ( ledoux 2003 ) .",
    "moreover , h@xmath82 is preferentially detected in the highest metallicity dlas ( petitjean 2006 ) .",
    "at this point it is sufficient to note that a ) only a very small fraction of qso sight - lines will probe the high - metallicity regions of dlas , and b ) due to h@xmath82 formation these regions may possibly be difficult to probe in neutral hydrogen ( zwaan & prochaska 2006 ) .",
    "we also note from fig .",
    "[ fig : dla ] ( right ) that the metal abundances of the high column density regions are significantly larger than what is typically observed in dlas , whereas at log(n(hi))@xmath11822 they are not ( e.g. , pettini 2003 ) .",
    "finally , we note that the high column density regions will likely be characterised by significant dust contents , which could further bias against selecting qso sight - lines passing through such regions .",
    "evidence for dust in dlas has been reported ( pei , fall & bechtold 1991 ; vladilo 2006 ) .",
    "this may naturally explain why dla column densities of log(n(hi))@xmath722 are very rare ( vladilo & proux 2005 , vladilo 2006 ) .",
    "however , studies of radio selected dlas ( free from dust - bias ) have found similar column density and metallicity distributions as for optically selected dla samples ( ellison 2001 , 2004 ; ellison , hall & lira 2005 ; akerman 2005 ; jorgenson 2006 ) .",
    "also , murphy & liske ( 2004 ) find no excess absorption towards qsos with dlas ( but this study is based on an optically selected dla sample ) .",
    "it remains to be clarified to which extent dust bias is important for dla column density and metallicity studies , especially at log(n(hi))@xmath722 . in particular , a larger sample of radio selected dlas is needed ( jorgenson 2006 , ellison 2007 , private communication ) .",
    "we note that dlas at @xmath196 with near solar metallicity have been found ( ledoux 2002 ) .",
    "also , the sloan digital sky survey has been used to strongly increase the sample of dlas ( prochaska 2005 ) and among these 5% have very strong metal - line absorption ( herbert - fort 2006 ) . some of these 5% are metal rich dlas , although some could be relatively metal poor dlas with very large hydrogen column densities .",
    "about 60% of the metal - strong dlas have detected molecular hydrogen ( milutinovic in preparation ) .",
    "interestingly , dlas with log(n(hi))@xmath722 have been detected in the spectra of the optical afterglows of gamma - ray bursts ( watson 2006 ; jakobsson 2006 ; prochaska 2007 ) .",
    "the selection function for grb sight - lines is completely different than the cross - section selection of qso dlas .",
    "grb sight - lines are strongly correlated with the blue light of their host galaxies ( bloom , kulkarni & djorgovski 2002 ; fruchter 2006 ) most likely tracing the location of the most massive stars ( m@xmath720m@xmath197 , larsson 2007 ) .",
    "significant dust obscuration is observed for at least some of the log(n(hi))@xmath722 grb dlas ( watson 2006 ) .",
    "furthermore , it has been found that the metallicities inferred for dlas in grb hosts are systematically higher than for qso dlas and that grbs hence may offer a new probe of early cosmic chemical evolution complementary to the qso dlas and lbgs ( fynbo 2006 ; savaglio 2006 ; prochaska 2007 ) .    in conclusion , the low metallicities inferred from qso dlas do not exclude that significant amounts of metals can reside in the @xmath198 phase .",
    "the reason for this is most likely that the total cross - section for this component is only of order a few percent of the total dla cross - section ( see also johansson & efstathiou 2006 ) and that the current dla samlpes are too small to uncover them ( see also zwaan & prochaska 2006 ) , but dust bias , as well as h@xmath82 formation , will probably also be of importance .",
    "in sgp03 and sommer - larsen ( 2006 ) it has been shown that the results of cosmological galaxy formation and evolution using our code are , in general , robust to changes of the numerical resolution . however , in this paper we present gas - phase metal temperature distributions and other results , which have not been presented before .",
    "it is hence clearly important to demonstrate that these results are resolution robust as well . to this end",
    "we carried out three very high resolution k98 imf simulations , of eight times higher mass and two times higher force resolution compared to `` standard '' .",
    "we simulated three ( proto-)disc galaxies , which at @xmath0=0 have characteristic circular velocities of 245 , 180 and 66 km / s .",
    "the galaxy forming regions were represented by a total of about 2.2 , 1.2 and 1.3 million particles , compared to the about 290000 , 150000 and 210000 particles used at `` normal '' resolution ( for computational reasons the region simulated at very high resolution for the last galaxy was slightly smaller than the corresponding `` normal '' resolution one ) .",

    "other results for the first two runs have already been presented in sommer - larsen ( 2006 ) , razoumov & sommer - larsen ( 2006 ) , greve & sommer - larsen ( 2007 ) , laursen & sommer - larsen ( 2007 ) and ellison ( 2007 ) .    in fig .",

    "it is seen that the general agreement is very good ; the slight disagreement for the small galaxy is due to the fact that the region simulated at very high resolution was slightly smaller than the corresponding normal resolution one .    due to computational limitations",
    "we did not perform similar resolution tests for the two other imfs considered , but we have no reason to believe that simulations based on these imfs would perform less well in resolution tests .",

    "it is concluded , that the reason why current dla surveys only detect a cold ism metal fraction of about 20% relative to the metal mass in galactic stars is that the total cross - section for the high - metallicity component is only of order a few percent of the total dla cross - section , and that the current dla samlpes are too small to uncover it .",

    "<S> the global temperature distribution of the cosmic gas - phase oxygen at @xmath0@xmath13 is determined by combining high resolution cosmological simulations of individual proto - galactic , as well as larger , regions with the observed , extinction - corrected , rest - frame v - band galaxy luminosity function . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations have been performed with three different stellar initial mass functions ( imfs ) , a kroupa ( k98 ) , a salpeter ( s ) and an arimoto- yoshii ( ay ) , spanning a range of a factor of five in chemical yield and specific snii energy feedback . </S>",
    "<S> gas - phase oxygen is binned according to @xmath2 as log@xmath3 ( `` cold '' ) , log@xmath4 ( `` warm '' ) , and log@xmath55.0 , 5.5 , 6.0 , 6.5 , 7.0 ( `` hot '' phases ) . </S>",
    "<S> oxygen is found to be distributed over all @xmath2 phases , in particular for the top - heavy ay imf . </S>",
    "<S> but , at variance with previous works , it is found that for the k98 and s imfs the cold phase is the most important . for these imfs </S>",
    "<S> it contains 47 and 37% , respectively , of all gas - phase oxygen , mainly at fairly high density , @xmath6@xmath70.1 @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the implications of this in relation to observational damped lyman-@xmath9 absorber ( dla ) studies are discussed . in relation to `` missing metals '' </S>",
    "<S> it is found that a significant fraction of the oxygen is located in a warm / hot phase that may be very difficult to detect . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it is found that less than about 20 - 25% of the cosmic oxygen is associated with galaxies brighter than @xmath10 , the faintest galaxy luminosities probed by current metallicity determinations for lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence , 75 - 80% of the oxygen is also in this sense `` missing '' . from the lbg based , @xmath11@xmath11500  </S>",
    "<S> uv luminosity density history at @xmath0@xmath123 , we obtain an essentially imf independent constraint on the mean oxygen density at @xmath0=3 . </S>",
    "<S> we compare this to what is obtained from our models , for the three different imfs . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the k98 imf is strongly excluded , as the chemical yield is simply too small , the salpeter is marginally excluded , and the ay matches the constraint well . </S>",
    "<S> the k98 imf can only match the data if the @xmath11@xmath11500  extinction corrections have been overestimated by factor of @xmath14 , which seems highly unlikely . </S>",
    "<S> the yields for k98 are also far too small to match the observational data for . </S>",
    "<S> the optimal imf should have a yield intermediate between the s and ay .    </S>",
