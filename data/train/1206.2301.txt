    "this is the third of a sequence of papers ( following [ fs ] and [ ads ] ) exploring the definitions and properties of laplacians on julia sets .",
    "one theme is the extension of ideas pioneered by jun kigami in the context of post - critically finite ( pcf ) self - similar fractals ( [ ki ] , [ s ] ) .",
    "the julia sets do not have the strictly self - similar structure , but they do share the finite ramifications properties of pcf fractals .",
    "kigami s approach is to approximate the fractal by a sequence of graphs , take a sequence of graph energies on these graphs and then an appropriately renormalized limit to obtain an energy on the fractal . combining the energy and a measure on the fractal via a weak formulation yields a laplacian , which can then be described as a suitably renormalized limit of graph laplacians , echoing the basic idea of calculus that derivatives are limits of difference quotients .",
    "the second theme is that julia sets may be realized as circles with identifications .",
    "indeed , the external ray parametrization gives a map from the circle onto the julia set , and the dynamics on the julia set is conjugate to a simple map on the circle .",
    "thus we can hope to take simple structures on the circle and transport them to the julia set .",
    "for example , the standard lebesgue measure on the circle may be pushed forward to the julia set , and this easily provides the measure we will use .",
    "the situation with the energy is more challenging",
    ".    we may informally refer to this approach as the _ method of peano curves_. indeed , the classical peano curves also give a realization of domains in the plane as circles with identifications .",
    "of course , no one in their right mind would suggest that the usual planar laplacian be constructed by pushing forward structures on the circle to planar regions via a peano curve .",
    "nevertheless , our approach might be successful in the context of other fractals .    in the first paper [ fs ] we studied a simple family of quadratic julia sets , including the familiar basilica and douady rabbit",
    "( the basilica had been treated earlier in [ rt ] ) . in this family",
    "there are only a countable number of identifications on the circle , and they arise in a coherent iterative scheme that gives rise to a family of graphs whose vertices are identified points and whose edges are arcs of the circle .",
    "we used a rather ad hoc method to renormalize the graph energies in order to obtain an energy in the limit that is invariant under the doubling map on the circle ( conjugate to the dynamics on the julia set ) . in [ ads ] the ad hoc procedure was replaced by a more systematic approach and this approach was used to study a few more complicated examples .",
    "we briefly outline the method .",
    "we start with a finite set of identified points on the circle , @xmath1 . to define an energy on the resulting graph we need to assign conductances ( reciprocals of resistances ) to the edges",
    ". the simplest choice would be to take the resistance to be equal to the length of the edge , but this is not satisfactory .",
    "instead , we divide the edges up into different types , and multiply the reciprocal of the length by a factor @xmath2 that depends on the type to obtain the desired conductance .",
    "we then use the dynamics ( in the case of quadratic julia sets this is just the doubling map on the circle ) to build a sequence of graphs , @xmath3 and energies @xmath4 that depend on the choice of weight factors @xmath5 . the key condition we want",
    "is that each level energy restricts to a multiple of the previous level energy , so @xmath6 , when @xmath7 is the harmonics extension of @xmath8 ( the one that minimizes the @xmath4 energy ) .",
    "this leads to a nonlinear eigenvalue problem for the @xmath5 .",
    "the key technical problem is to solve this eigenvalue problem .",
    "note that this is exactly the problem encountered in the case of pcf fractals ( see [ p ] for recent work on that case ) .",
    "in this paper we study a family of julia sets for higher order polynomials , but with the condition that the polynomial has a single critical points , with canonical form @xmath9 .",
    "we are able to generalize the construction in [ fs ] to this case , and in particular we study in detail some examples when @xmath10 .",
    "although the construction itself follows the same outline , the structure of the spectrum of the laplacian is quite different .",
    "one striking feature is that all eigenspaces ( beyond the trivial space of constant functions ) have even multiplicity .",
    "we will give an explanation for this phenomenon based on the fact that 3 is an odd number , and more precisely the fact that the dihedral-@xmath11 group for @xmath11 odd has only two distinct irreducible representation of dimension one ( when @xmath11 is even there are four such representations ) .",
    "the other example we study is the formal mating of two quadratic julia sets , specially a dendrite studied in [ ads ] and the anti - rabbit .",
    "we are able to construct the energy explicitly , and we examine in detail the structure on the spectrum of the laplacian , which is more closely related to the spectrum for the rabbit than for the dendrite .",
    "we also briefly discuss two other simple mating for which we were unable to carry out the method outlined above .",
    "this strongly suggests that new ideas will be required to understand these example and other matings .    in section 2",
    "we describe the construction of invariant energies and laplacians for families of julia sets for @xmath12th order polynomials with a single critical point . in section 3",
    "we discuss matings of julia sets . in section 4",
    "we present numerical data for eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the laplacian for these examples .",
    "more data may be found on the website [ http://www.math.cornell.edu/@xmath13etota001/ ] . in section 5",
    "we discuss the structure of the various spectra , giving rigorous explanations of observations that were first made from the experimental results .",
    "fix an integer @xmath14 , and consider julia sets of polynomials @xmath9 .",
    "these polynomials have a single critical points , so their julia sets are closely related to julia sets of quadratic polynomials ( the case @xmath15 ) .",
    "typically the julia sets may be realized as circles with identifications via exterior ray parameterizations .",
    "rather than use the parameter @xmath16 we use a parameter @xmath17 in the circle @xmath18 .",
    "the correspondence @xmath19 is not one - to - one , but different choices of @xmath16 corresponding to the same @xmath17 yield topologically equivalent julia sets .",
    "assume for simplicity that @xmath17 is rational .",
    "in fact , we will mainly be dealing with the choice of @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "subdivide the circle into the @xmath11 arcs @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "for each @xmath23 in the circle define its kneading sequence @xmath24 by the conditions @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and identify points @xmath27 if and only if they have the same kneading sequence .",
    "only rational points get identified , so there are only a countable number of identifications , and this gives a description of the julia set as a limit of the circle with a finite number of identifications .    for the special case @xmath20 we observe that the @xmath28 points @xmath29 , @xmath30 are all identified ( kneading sequence @xmath31 , and these are the only identifications among points of the form @xmath32 . among points of the form @xmath33 we will identify @xmath34 for each @xmath35 because they have the kneading sequence @xmath36 .",
    "this produces the first approximating graph @xmath1 with @xmath11 vertices .",
    "the edges are the pairs of adjacent vertices on the circle .",
    "note that @xmath37 of the edges are loops , connecting identified points .",
    "although the loops do not contribute to the energy , it is convenient to keep them in order to describe the inductive construction of the graph .",
    "note that the lengths of the edges are @xmath38 for @xmath39 .",
    "we call them edges of type @xmath40 . for @xmath41",
    "these are loops , while for @xmath42 these are edges joining @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "inductively , we define the graph @xmath3 by retaining all the identifications in @xmath45 for @xmath46 and identifying @xmath47 for @xmath48 .",
    "these points have kneading sequence @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "moreover , we can give a subdivision rule that describes the edges in @xmath3 in terms of the edges in @xmath51 .",
    "the edges of type @xmath40 in @xmath51 have length @xmath52 . when @xmath53 they remain edges in @xmath3 of type @xmath54 .",
    "when @xmath55 the edges subdivides into @xmath56 loops of type @xmath40 for each @xmath41 and @xmath11 edges of type 0 , where the sequence of types is @xmath57 .",
    "note that the lengths add up correctly : @xmath58    figures 2.1 illustrates the identifications for the cubic basilica ( @xmath59 ) and cubic rabbit ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "figures 2.2 shows the corresponding julia sets .",
    "we may now describe the energies on the graphs @xmath3 that we will use to approximate the energy on the julia set .",
    "let @xmath8 be a function on @xmath3 , or equivalently a function on the circle that respects identifications , i.e , @xmath61 if @xmath62 and @xmath63 are identified .",
    "then , let @xmath64 summed over all type @xmath40 intervals @xmath65 $ ] , and @xmath66 for positive weights @xmath5 .",
    "note that loops do not contribute to these energies , but we leave them in the sum ( 2.1 ) for simplicity of notation . also @xmath67 .",
    "if @xmath8 is defined on @xmath51 , we consider all possible extension to @xmath3 and let @xmath7 be the one that minimizes @xmath68 .",
    "call this the _",
    "harmonic extension_. it might seem that the harmonic extension depends on the choice of weights , but in fact it does not .",
    "in fact is is rather easy to describe the harmonic extension and to relate @xmath69 to @xmath70 .",
    "all the new vertices in @xmath3 lie in the type @xmath71 edges of @xmath51 , and each such edge contains @xmath56 sets of @xmath28 identified points .",
    "we have to chose the new values of @xmath7 on these sets of identified points to interpolate linearly between the values of @xmath8 on the endpoints of the original edge in order to minimize the contribution to @xmath72 from this set of edges .",
    "in other words , if the original edge in @xmath51 was @xmath65 $ ] with difference @xmath73 , we end up with differences @xmath74 on each of the @xmath11 edges of type 0 .",
    "( the other edges are loops . )",
    "so the edge that contributed @xmath75 to @xmath76 now contributes @xmath77 to @xmath72 , a magnification factor of @xmath78 .",
    "there are no other type 0 edges in @xmath3 and all the type @xmath40 edges for @xmath41 are just the type @xmath79 edges in @xmath51 .",
    "thus , @xmath80 for the matrix @xmath81 by choosing @xmath5 to be a left eigenvector for @xmath82 , @xmath83 we obtain , @xmath84 since @xmath85 , it is easy to see that @xmath86 and @xmath87 give the unique positive solution to ( 2.5 ) .",
    "so , we make this choice and renormalize by @xmath88 so that @xmath89 then , @xmath90 is well - defined on @xmath91 $ ] with @xmath92 if and only if @xmath8 is constant .",
    "we say @xmath93 if @xmath94 .",
    "next we consider the behavior of the energy under the action of the map @xmath95 where @xmath96 .",
    "note that @xmath97 is conjugate to the polynomial @xmath9 on the actual julia set .",
    "suppose @xmath98 is an edge of type @xmath40 in @xmath51 .",
    "then @xmath99 for @xmath100 are edges in @xmath3 also of type @xmath40 .",
    "since the length of the edges are reduced by the factor @xmath11 , it follows that the contribution from the @xmath11 edges in @xmath3 to @xmath101 is exactly @xmath102 times the contribution from @xmath98 to @xmath103 .",
    "thus , @xmath104 since ( 2.10 ) is independent of @xmath40 we obtain @xmath105 hence , @xmath106    to define a laplacian we need a measure on the julia set , which we take to be the lebesgue measure , @xmath107 , on the circle , since the identical points form a set of measure zero .",
    "this is called the _ equilibrium measure _ because @xmath108    we define @xmath109 via the identity @xmath110 for all @xmath111 , where the bilinear form @xmath112 is obtained from the quadratic form @xmath113 and the polarization identity .",
    "it follows from ( 2.12 ) and ( 2.13 ) that @xmath114 and this is the invariance condition of @xmath115 under the action of @xmath97 .",
    "we can also represent the laplacian as a limit of renormalized graph laplacians @xmath116 on the graphs @xmath3 .",
    "note that there are exactly @xmath117 distinct vertices in @xmath3 and they are equally distributed , so the right side of ( 2.14 ) is approximated by @xmath118 . for a fixed @xmath119 , we choose @xmath120 ( in other words @xmath121 ) and define @xmath122    we can write this more explicitly by noting that each @xmath62 has @xmath123 edges ( some may be counted twice ) , with two of each @xmath40 type .",
    "let @xmath124 denote this set of edges , and for each edge let @xmath63 denote the other endpoint ( note we may have @xmath125 if the edge is a loop ) , and let @xmath40 denote the type .",
    "then @xmath126 with the conductances @xmath127 given by @xmath128",
    "suppose @xmath129 and @xmath130 are julia sets for the polynomials @xmath131 and @xmath132 with the same degree @xmath11 .",
    "if we realize @xmath129 and @xmath130 as circles with identifications corresponding to the parameters @xmath133 and @xmath134 , then we can realize the formal mating @xmath135 of @xmath129 and @xmath130 as a circle with identifications @xmath136 if and only if @xmath137 and @xmath138 are identified in @xmath129 or @xmath139 and @xmath140 are identified in @xmath130 .",
    "the main problem we consider is how to construct an invariant ( under @xmath141 ) energy on @xmath135 if we know how to construct invariant energies on @xmath129 and @xmath130 . more specifically ,",
    "suppose we have increasing sequences @xmath142 and @xmath143 of identified points in @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "then we form @xmath144 and make the appropriate identifications .",
    "we will always assume that @xmath145 and @xmath146 , so that @xmath147 .",
    "we make @xmath3 into a graph by declaring edges between all neighboring points on the circle",
    ".    our strategy would be to define different types of edges in these graphs , then form the type @xmath40 energy via ( 2.1 ) and the full energy via ( 2.2 ) for a suitable choice of weights .",
    "we would then want to define subdivision rules for how an edges of type @xmath40 in @xmath51 breaks up into edges of different types in @xmath3 .",
    "we could then find the energy minimizing extension @xmath7 and compute a matrix @xmath82 for which ( 2.3 ) is valid .",
    "note that we can expect that the matrix @xmath82 depends on the weights @xmath5 , so that ( 2.5 ) becomes a nonlinear eigenvalue problem .",
    "nevertheless , if we are able to find a positive solution , then we can define a renormalization ( 2.7 ) of the energy ( 2.2 ) such that ( 2.8 ) holds , and then define an energy on @xmath135 via ( 2.9 ) .",
    "it appears that this strategy is successful in only a few special cases .",
    "we will discuss one example where it works , and then very briefly two examples where we were unable to make it work .",
    "in all these examples @xmath148 , so we are considering formal matings of quadratic julia sets . from the point of view of dynamical systems ,",
    "the most interesting formal matings are the ones which yield julia sets of rational mappings .",
    "these are called simply _",
    "matings_. our main example is not such a mating . see [ ] for details",
    ".    our main example has @xmath149 and @xmath150 , so @xmath129 is the dendrite discussed in detail in [ ads ] and @xmath130 is the anti - rabbit ( the mirror image of the rabbit @xmath151 ) . in this example",
    "@xmath142 and @xmath152 consist of exactly the same points , only with different identifications .",
    "thus @xmath3 consists of all points of the form @xmath153 for @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "the rabbit identification simply identifies @xmath156 , @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "we will call these triplets .",
    "the dendrite makes many of the same identifications , but also makes some different identifications that result in pairs of triplets begin identified to create _",
    "sextuplets_. the first example occurs when @xmath159 , with the identification of the @xmath160 and @xmath161 triplet .",
    "therefore , for @xmath162 , there will be identifications of pairs of triplets for all @xmath163 .",
    "for @xmath164 a different type of sextuple arises by identifying the @xmath165 and @xmath166 triplet , leading to identifications for all @xmath167 for @xmath168 .",
    "note that the triplets first identified for @xmath159 and @xmath164 contain the dividing points @xmath169 and @xmath170 for the dendrite .",
    "more generally , for @xmath171 there will be triplets corresponding to @xmath172 and @xmath173 that contain these dividing points and so get identified in a sextuplet , and for all @xmath174 this will result in identifications of all triplets with @xmath175 .",
    "the exact description of the pairing of such triplets is rather complicated and will not be given here .",
    "these give all the sextuplets , and if we denote by @xmath176 the number on level @xmath177 , then @xmath178 which leads to , @xmath179 for @xmath180    the graph @xmath3 consists of intervals of lengths @xmath181 for @xmath182 , and we will call these intervals of type 1 , 2 and 3 . when we pass to the next graph @xmath183 , the intervals of type 1 and 2 do not subdivide and simply become intervals of type 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "intervals of type 3 subdivide into four intervals of types 1 , 2 , 3 , 1 in that order .",
    "some intervals will be loops ( endpoints identified ) , and those do not contribute to the energy .",
    "those that are not loops will always be paired , meaning that there will be two ( and sometimes four ) intervals with identified endpoints .",
    "figure 3.1 shows the subdivision of paired intervals in @xmath184 when increasing @xmath177 to 5 , yielding two sets of paired type 1 intervals .",
    "a more detailed analysis of identifications in subdivision will be given in section 5 .",
    "here the important observations is that the intervals of type 2 and 3 created in the subdivision are loops and so do not contribute to energy , and intervals of type 1 are all paired .",
    "the analysis of the energy is then exactly the same as for the rabbit .",
    "we consider the three energies @xmath185 , @xmath186 and @xmath187 and observe that @xmath188 , @xmath189 and @xmath190 , so the matrix is @xmath191    thus ,    @xmath192    perhaps the simplest nontrivial matings are the basilica / rabbit and rabbit / rabbit matings .",
    "we studied these examples extensively searching for a way to sort the edges into a finite number of types , and then find subdivision rules for passing from one graph to the next .",
    "what we found was that each time we increased the level @xmath177 , it was necessary to add new edge types .",
    "it seems unlikely that there would be only a finite number of edge types that would work for all @xmath177 , although there is the remote possibility that we stopped the search too soon .",
    "we then investigated constructing energies using a small number of edge types and weights chosen through trial and error , attempting to obtain approximate laplacians that had some rough consistency from level to level .",
    "the results were not very satisfactory .",
    "some data from these attempts may be found on the website .",
    "in this section we present numerical data on the examples above . in each case , to obtain the data , we approximated the julia set , or formal mating of julia sets , by a graph .",
    "we then computed the graph laplacian on the approximating graph , with the adjustment to the standard graph laplacian coming from the weighting of the edges of the graph , and the measure placed on the graph . using the built in eigenvalue and eigenvector functionalities in mathematica and matlab",
    ", we produced approximations of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the laplacian on the set .    the data presented comes from the highest level approximation computed .",
    "we present a selection of eigenfunctions , the first 150 eigenvalues , the eigenvalue counting function and the weyl ratio .",
    "the first example , the cubic basilica , corresponds to @xmath193 and @xmath194 , so @xmath195 , the first julia set shown in figures 2.1 and 2.2 .",
    "figure 4.1 shows the first eight non - constant eigenfunctions , figure 4.2 shows the eigenvalue counting function , @xmath196 , and figure 4.3 shows the weyl ratio @xmath197 for the appropriate power @xmath198 , which in this case is @xmath199 .",
    "table 4.1 shows the first 150 eigenvalues .",
    "the second example , the cubic rabbit , corresponds to @xmath193 and @xmath200 , so @xmath201 , the second julia set show in figures 2.1 and 2.2 .",
    "the corresponding data here is shown in figures 4.4 - 6 ( with @xmath202 ) and table 4.2 .",
    "the last example is the dendrite - antirabbit formal mating discussed in section 3 .",
    "figure 4.7 shows the first eight eigenfunctions and figure 4.8 shows a multiplicity 5 eigenspace .",
    "figure 4.9 shows the eigenvalue counting function and figure 4.10 shows the the weyl ratio with the value @xmath203 determined experimentally .",
    "table 4.3 shows the first 150 eigenvalues .",
    "we consider first the simple julia sets discussed in section 2 with parameters @xmath204 .",
    "note that ( 2.15 ) implies that if @xmath8 is an eigenfunction of @xmath205 with eigenvalue @xmath206 , then @xmath207 is an eigenfunction with eigenvalue @xmath208 .",
    "in particular , the spectrum is preserved under multiplication by @xmath209 .",
    "it therefore makes sense to split the nonzero eigenvalues into the _ primitive _ ones , not of the form @xmath210 for some other eigenvalue @xmath211 , and the _ derived _ ones that have this form .",
    "moreover , the derived eigenvalues have an_order _ @xmath212 , the unique value for which the eigenvalue for which the eigenvalue @xmath213 for @xmath211 a primitive eigenvalue . note that primitive eigenvalues will have order zero under this definition .",
    "let @xmath214 denote the multiplicity of the @xmath206-eigenspace    [ section ]    let @xmath193 .",
    "then @xmath214 only depends on the order of @xmath206 , @xmath215 where @xmath216 and the recursion relations    @xmath217    hold .",
    "in particular , all multiplicities are even ( for @xmath218 ) .",
    "we will sketch an argument for why we believe the conjecture is valid .",
    "it is unlikely that this can be made into a proof since it uses the `` no coincidences '' principle : unrelated eigenfunctions will have different eigenvalues .",
    "( a similar principle may be invoked in describing the spectrum of the ordinary laplacian on the unit disc , where it amounts to saying that bessel functions of distinct orders do not have common zeros . )",
    "the occurrence of coincidences would increase the multiplicities ( but they would still be even ) . because of the spectral clustering phenomena discussed below , we expect that there will be many near coincidences , so numerical approximations will not be effective in ruling out coincidences .",
    "we note that the conjecture gives a description of multiplicities that differs substantially from the examples with @xmath148 discussed in [ fs ] .",
    "we expect that suitable modifications of the conjecture will be valid for odd values of @xmath11 .",
    "the key observation is that there is a symmetry group of dihedral-3 type acting on these julia sets .",
    "it is clear that the rotation @xmath219 is a symmetry , and this generates a @xmath220 symmetry group . when @xmath221 it is also clear that the reflections of the circle about the diameters @xmath222 , @xmath223 , @xmath224 are symmetries of @xmath135 . for @xmath225",
    "there are `` reflection '' symmetries that are not true reflections of the circle , but still fix one of the points in @xmath1 and permute the other two .",
    "for example , this map will actually be the identity on the whole arc containing the identified points on the circle corresponding to the fixed points in @xmath1 , in other words on the set of `` ears '' of @xmath135 that attach to the point .",
    "a similar idea was discussed for @xmath148 in [ fs ] .",
    "symmetries preserve the eigenspaces , so each eigenspace splits into a direct sum of spaces that transform according to the irreducible representations of the symmetry group . in this case",
    "there are just three such representations : two one - dimensional representations , the trivial and alternating representations , and one two - dimensional representation .",
    "note that both one - dimensional representations act like the identity on the rotational @xmath220 subgroup .",
    "[ thm]lemma    an eigenfunction @xmath8 is of the form @xmath226 for another eigenfunction @xmath227 if and only if    @xmath228    as a consequence , a primitive eigenspace can not contain any components corresponding to one - dimensional representations .",
    "if ( 5.2 ) holds , we may define @xmath229 .",
    "then @xmath230 and @xmath227 is an eigenfunction .",
    "conversely , if @xmath230 , then clearly ( 5.2 ) holds .",
    "this shows that primitive eigenspaces have even multiplicity , and the no coincidences principle would make @xmath216 .",
    "however , we can arrive at another important insight with the observation that the two dimensional representation contains one dimensional subspaces that are skew - symmetric under one of the reflections .",
    "thus , the eigenspace contains a function @xmath8 that satisfies @xmath231 for the reflection that fixes a point @xmath62 in @xmath1 .",
    "now @xmath62 splits @xmath135 into a large arc and a small arc , and because of the skew - symmetry we can write @xmath8 as a sum of eigenfunctions supported on each of them .",
    "however , we may argue that the one supported on the small arc must be zero , for if not we could rotate it around to create a nonzero eigenfunction satisfying ( 5.2 ) , contradicting the fact that we have a primitive eigenspace .",
    "therefore we conclude that the primitive eigenspace has a function supported on the large arc and vanishing on the small arc .",
    "taking two points in @xmath1 gives us a basis ( of course the functions associated with all three points are linearly dependent ) .",
    "we already observe a contrast with the @xmath148 case discussed in [ fs ] where essentially every eigenfunction vanishes on an open set , since if we take a sum of two such functions the result will not have such a vanishing property .",
    "next we describe how to pass from a primitive eigenspace to the derived eigenspace of order 1 .",
    "let @xmath8 be the eigenfunction that vanishes on @xmath232 $ ] .",
    "then @xmath233 vanishes on @xmath234 $ ] , @xmath235 $ ] and @xmath236 $ ] .",
    "note that @xmath227 is supported on the union of three intervals @xmath237 $ ] , @xmath238 and @xmath239 , and these intervals are separated in @xmath135 .",
    "therefore we can split @xmath227 into a sum of three eigenfunctions supported in each of these intervals .",
    "on the other hand @xmath240 is supported on @xmath241 , @xmath242 and @xmath243 and these intervals are connected in @xmath135 .",
    "thus we arrive at the conclusion that @xmath244 with a basis of eigenfunctions vanishing on certain open intervals .",
    "the process of passing from derived eigenspaces of order @xmath245 to derived eigenspaces of order @xmath212 is similar .",
    "if @xmath246 is our special basis for the order @xmath245 eigenspace , we consider the functions @xmath247 .",
    "depending on the residue of @xmath248 , all but one or all but two of them will be supported on separated intervals , and may be split into three linearly independent eigenfunctions .",
    "this gives the relation ( 5.1 ) , and a special basis .",
    "we can make another conjecture concerning the location in the spectrum of derived eigenvalues .",
    "let @xmath249 denote the lowest eigenvalue , and then label consecutive eigenvalues @xmath250 repeated according to multiplicity . for any eigenvalue @xmath206 denote by @xmath251 the largest @xmath40 such that @xmath252 .",
    "we know that the eigenvalue counting function @xmath253 has growth rate @xmath254 for @xmath255 and the weyl ration @xmath256 tends to a multiplicatively periodic function of period @xmath209 .",
    "that means @xmath257 .",
    "[ thm]conjecture    let @xmath193 .",
    "then    @xmath258    this conjecture is based solely on experimental evidence .",
    "it is not valid for @xmath148 .",
    "a similar conjecture was described in [ ads ] for the dendrite example , but not for the other examples presented there .",
    "a similar result was proved for the sierpinski gasket in [ s ] .",
    "the experimental evidence points to the existence of spectral gaps between @xmath259 and @xmath260 , although it is not clear what the lower bound of the ratio @xmath261 might be . also , we see many eigenvalues that are distinct relatively but close together , suggesting that spectral clustering ( arbitrarily many distinct eigenvalues in arbitrarily small intervals ) may occur .",
    "next we discuss the spectrum for the dendrite - anti rabbit mating . for this",
    "we need a precise definition of the two reflection symmetries . for the rabbit",
    "there are reflections we called _ horizontal _ @xmath262 and _ vertical _ @xmath263 in [ fs ] , so we will keep the same terminology here , since the reflection on the mating are essentially the same .",
    "( note that these are not symmetries of the dendrite . )",
    "the horizontal reflection is the map @xmath264 on the intervals @xmath265 $ ] and @xmath266 $ ] and maps @xmath267 $ ] to itself , and also @xmath268 $ ] to itself , while the vertical reflection is the identity on the intervals @xmath265 $ ] and @xmath266 $ ] and interchanges the intervals @xmath267 $ ] and @xmath268 $ ] .",
    "to describe those reflections on the remaining intervals @xmath267 $ ] and @xmath268 $ ] we observe that we may define an `` orientation reversing '' map between two intervals in the @xmath3 graph of type 3 iteratively as follows .",
    "say the intervals are @xmath269 $ ] and @xmath270 $ ] , and we want to map @xmath157 to @xmath271 and @xmath158 to @xmath272 .",
    "we subdivide the intervals in @xmath183    and map the outer subintervals to each other in orientation reversing fashion , and the inner subintervals are mapped to each other by translation .",
    "see figure 5.2 . in particular , @xmath262 is the identity on @xmath273 $ ] and maps @xmath274 $ ] to @xmath275 $ ] reversing orientation ( and similarly on @xmath268 $ ] ) , and @xmath263 is the translation @xmath264 mapping @xmath273 $ ] to @xmath276 $ ] ( and backward ) , while it is orientation reversing between @xmath274 $ ] and @xmath277 $ ] and similarly between @xmath275 $ ] and @xmath278 $ ] .",
    "these two reflections generate a symmetry group isomorphic to @xmath279 , the composition in either order being the translation @xmath264 .",
    "primitive eigenfunctions must be skew - symmetric with respect to this translation , so they fall into two types : _ horizontal _ eigenfunctions are skew - symmetric with respect to @xmath262 and symmetric with respect to @xmath263 , while _ vertical _ eigenfunctions have the reverse symmetry .",
    "note that horizontal eigenfunctions vanish on @xmath273 $ ] and @xmath276 $ ] because @xmath262 is the identity on those intervals .",
    "it then follows that eigenfunctions derived from horizontal eigenfunctions will vanish on prescribed intervals , but will generate one - dimensional eigenspaces ( assuming no coincidences ) .",
    "similar reasoning shows that vertical eigenfunctions are supported in @xmath267 \\cup [ \\frac{4}{7 } , \\frac{9}{14}]$ ] , but actually we can say more .",
    "[ thm]theorem    primitive vertical eigenfunctions are supported in @xmath280 \\cup [ \\frac{67}{112 } , \\frac{71}{112}]$ ]    if @xmath281 then @xmath282 imples @xmath283 . from this",
    "we infer that @xmath8 is supported on @xmath267 \\cup [ \\frac{4}{7 } , \\frac{9}{14}]$ ] , and it also vanishes at the sextuplet @xmath284 .",
    "it also follows from the skew - symmetry that we may cut the eigenfunciton at these points , to obtain three distinct eigenfunctions supported on @xmath274 \\cup [ \\frac{15}{112 } , \\frac{16}{112 } ] \\cup [ \\frac{64}{112 } , \\frac{65}{112 } ] \\cup [ \\frac{71}{112 } , \\frac{72}{112}]$ ] , on @xmath285 \\cup [ \\frac{65}{112 } , \\frac{67}{112}]$ ] , and on @xmath280 \\cup [ \\frac{67}{112 } , \\frac{71}{112}]$ ] .",
    "we need to show that the first two vanish identically , and for this we need to use the fact that we are assuming the eigenvalue is primitive .",
    "suppose first that @xmath8 is supported on @xmath285 \\cup [ \\frac{65}{112 } , \\frac{67}{112}]$ ] . then @xmath286 $ , } \\\\ -u(\\frac{1}{4}x+\\frac{1}{16 } ) & \\text { if",
    "$ x \\in [ \\frac{1}{14 } , \\frac{1}{7}]$ , } \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise . } \\end{cases}\\ ] ] is also an eigenfunction , contradicting the assumption that the eigenvalue is primitive .",
    "similarly , if @xmath8 is supported in the first union of four intervals , @xmath287 $ , } \\\\",
    "-u(\\frac{1}{8}x+\\frac{1}{16 } ) & \\text { if $ x \\in [ \\frac{1}{14 } , \\frac{1}{7}]$ , } \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise . } \\end{cases}\\ ] ] is also an eigenfunction .",
    "we can now describe the derived eigenspaces and their multiplicities .",
    "if @xmath288 is a primitive vertical eigenfunction , then @xmath289 is a derived eigenfunction supported on @xmath290 \\cup [ \\frac{67}{7(2 ^ 5 ) } , \\frac{71}{7(2 ^ 5 ) } ] \\cup [ \\frac{123}{7(2 ^ 5 ) } , \\frac{127}{7(2 ^ 5 ) } ] \\cup [ \\frac{189}{7(2 ^ 5 ) } , \\frac{193}{7(2 ^ 5)}]$ ] .",
    "this support is not connected , however , and splits into the connected sets @xmath290   \\cup [ \\frac{189}{7(2 ^ 5 ) } , \\frac{193}{7(2 ^ 5)}]$ ] and @xmath291 \\cup [ \\frac{123}{7(2 ^ 5 ) } , \\frac{127}{7(2 ^ 5)}]$ ] . by restricting @xmath289 to each of these sets",
    "we obtain a 2-dimensional eigenspace . by iterating this argument",
    "we obtain a splitting of @xmath292 into @xmath293 linearly independent eigenfunctions . but",
    "this is not the whole story .",
    "there are two other types of eigenfunctions that arise .    to describe the first type consider the case @xmath194 .",
    "each of the four pieces of @xmath294 is supported in a pair of intervals of length @xmath295 , and the eight total intervals are obtained from @xmath296 $ ] by rotation by multiples of @xmath297 .",
    "however , there is another pair of intervals @xmath298 $ ] and @xmath299 $ ] that are paired and support another eigenfunction obtained from pieces of @xmath294 that are rotated by multiples of @xmath300 .",
    "thus we get a multiplicity 5 eigenspace . when @xmath301 we double the multiplicity to 10 by splitting each of the 5 eigenfunctions from @xmath194 .",
    "for @xmath302 we split the 10 previous eigenfunctions , add one more by paired intervals rotated by multiples of @xmath303 , but also there is yet another type of eigenfunction supported on a set of four intervals with endpoints belonging to two sextuplets of identified points @xmath304 \\cup [ \\frac{43}{7(2 ^ 6 ) } , \\frac{44}{7(2 ^ 6 ) } ] \\cup [ \\frac{260}{7(2 ^ 6 ) } , \\frac{261}{7(2 ^ 6 ) } ] \\cup [ \\frac{267}{7(2 ^ 6 ) } , \\frac{268}{7(2 ^ 6)}]$ ] .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 5.3 .",
    "this is the @xmath305 case of a more general construction that yields an eigenfunction supported on @xmath306 intervals with endpoints belonging to @xmath307 sextuplets of identified points .",
    "these eigenfunctions arise at level @xmath28 for @xmath308 even with @xmath309 .    in general ,",
    "when @xmath28 is odd we just split the eigenfunctions from level @xmath71 .",
    "when @xmath28 is even ( and @xmath308 ) we also add a total of @xmath310 eigenfunctions are described above .",
    "if @xmath311 denotes the multiplicities then    @xmath312    this implies @xmath313 , which is easily solved to obtain @xmath314 , and then @xmath315 .",
