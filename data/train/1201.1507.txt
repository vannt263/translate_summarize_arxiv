    "in the last decade , a flood of research on systems that can be represented as networks has revealed that most differ markedly from simple random graph models  @xcite .",
    "for example , many exhibit a broad , or  scale - free \" degree distribution , making them robust to random failures but rendering them vulnerable to targeted attacks  @xcite .",
    "complex networks research also offers a framework for representing biological processes such as gene regulation  @xcite , protein - protein interactions  @xcite , and even connections between diseases and symptoms  @xcite .",
    "our growing understanding of how epidemics spread on networks has led to parallel insights into the propagation of information , fashions , ideas , and fads  @xcite .",
    "complex network studies have incorporated features such as the weight and direction of links to describe systems more precisely .",
    "link directionality plays a particularly important role in dynamics , as small changes to link structure can completely change the dynamics on a network  @xcite .",
    "thus , capturing the directional structure is essential to understanding the dynamics on directed networks , much as the connectivity structure is essential to dynamic processes on undirected networks .    one impediment , however , is that it is difficult , if not impossible , to obtain a complete list of links for many networks , including , for example , the world wide web ( www ) or large - scale gene - regulatory networks .",
    "the web changes so quickly that by the time one could have covered it , it would be substantially transformed  @xcite . even if one somehow managed to completely map its structure at some point in time , analyzing such a large network , estimated to contain at least 19 billion pages  @xcite , would present further impediments .",
    "there is no way to avoid biases because the web can only be sampled by following directional hyperlinks , which leaves portions inaccessible .",
    "furthermore , as has been found to be the case with sampled , undirected networks , the sampled web s appearance might even fundamentally change depending on the type of sampling method used  @xcite .",
    "if we are to have a clear and reliable picture of large - scale directed networks and their statistical properties , it is important that we quantitatively understand the effects of sampling biases on the properties of interest , as well as why such biases arise .",
    "insight into these questions stands to impact structure - exploiting search and ranking algorithms , such as google s pagerank  @xcite , and may cause us to rethink what we know about the structure , function , and evolution of real - world networks .    up to now the statistical properties of sampled _ undirected networks",
    "_ have been investigated in several papers .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite studied the degree distribution of two random networks ",
    "one that had been sampled  uniformly \" by picking nodes at random , and one that was subject to connectivity - dependent sampling  both analytically and numerically .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite also studied , numerically , the effects of random sampling and snowball sampling  @xcite , on statistical properties of real scale - free networks  including degree distribution exponents , betweenness centrality exponents , assortativity , and clustering coefficient  demonstrating that these quantities could be either overestimated or underestimated , depending on the fraction of the network sampled and the type of sampling method used . kurant _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite provided a detailed analytic treatment of measurement bias due to random sampling and breadth - first search ( bfs ) sampling  @xcite , showing that , for example , bfs sampling can lead to overestimation of average degree , and random sampling to underestimation .    in the case of directed networks , however , even though the structural properties of many directed real - world networks have been examined  @xcite , much less work has addressed the statistical properties that result from sampling them  @xcite .",
    "the majority of numerical studies in these works were not performed at a level of rigor sufficient to produce meaningful statistics . also , the researchers began their studies with already - biased network data since they were obtained using a web crawler .",
    "for these reasons , we investigate the biases induced by sampling large - scale directed networks starting with complete networks that differ from one another structurally .",
    "several structural properties such as average degree , variance in degree , degree auto - correlation , reciprocity , assortativity , and component structure  all of which are defined in later sections  are analyzed to give a more complete picture of sampling - induced biases . because we know the full , final structure we can accurately measure how systematic errors in measured quantities are affected by sampling coverage and sampling method .",
    "we find that the earlier conclusions in  @xcite regarding biases in average degree of undirected networks due to random sampling and bfs sampling also hold for directed networks . on the other hand , in direct contradiction with  @xcite",
    ", we conclude that both random sampling and bfs sampling overestimate edge reciprocity in the networks we study . we show that both sampling methods overestimate degree auto - correlation , sometimes by nearly 400% .",
    "in addition , we find that random sampling and bfs sampling affect the variance of in- and out - degree differently : both are underestimated by random sampling while variance in in - degree is underestimated and variance in out - degree overestimated by bfs sampling . finally , we expand on the work in  @xcite by providing a thorough examination of component sizes and abundances under random sampling and bfs sampling .    in sec .",
    "[ properties_of_directed networks ] , we define the large - scale structural properties of directed networks , the so - called  bow - tie \" structure  @xcite , and introduce the complete networks studied in this work . we also provide a detailed accounting of the sampling methods used . in sec .",
    "[ sampling_results ] , we present results for bfs sampling and uniform , random sampling on these networks and , where possible , provide arguments regarding how sampling can lead to measurement bias .",
    "we systematically study how accuracy is affected by the fraction of the network sampled in the two cases .",
    "finally , summary and concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "[ summary_and_discussion ] .",
    "[ cols= \" > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     degree auto - correlation quantifies the extent to which nodes of high in - degree also have high out - degree , and is defined as @xmath0 . the covariance is given by , @xmath1 .",
    "all networks , except for berkstan and stanford , have moderately high degree auto - correlation ( @xmath2 ) .    in the case of random sampling ,",
    "the degree auto - correlation , @xmath3 , is unbiased if @xmath4 is large enough to ensure an adequate density of links , since the in- and out - degrees for each node are sampled randomly .",
    "figures  [ fig : auto - correlation](a ) and ( b ) show this effect , although , for small @xmath4 , some nodes are isolated and therefore have no in- or out - degree , trivially causing an increase in degree auto - correlation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : auto - correlation](b ) ) . as can also be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : auto - correlation ] , bfs enhances  by up to 400%  degree auto - correlation at low sampling coverage .",
    "the link reciprocity r is defined as the fraction of links in a network that participate in a two - way relationship , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 means the number of edges belonging to bidirectional connections and @xmath7 is the total number of links in the network  @xcite . for each node @xmath8",
    ", we can also similarly define a local recicprocity @xmath9 , which is the fraction of node @xmath8 s edges belonging to bidirectional connections .        for random sampling , in the absence of self - links ( _ i.e. _ links that start and end on the same node ) , reciprocity is constant , independent of sampling coverage , since any pair of nodes is chosen with the same probability as any other pair of nodes . if , however , self - links are present , the reciprocity under random sampling is higher than that of the true network since the self - links ( which are reciprocal by definition ) appear with probability @xmath10 .",
    "the reciprocity with respect to @xmath4 is @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the fraction of self - links among bidirectional links .",
    "thus , one can see that in the presence of self - links , the reciprocity is no longer constant , but quickly approaches its asymptotic value as @xmath13 increases . the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : r](a ) illustrate this effect for wiki2007 which exhibits a small fraction ( @xmath14 ) of self - links among all bidirectional links .",
    "the gray lines in the figures are the expectation lines from the above equation and agree perfectly with the data",
    ".    for bfs sampling , however , reciprocity is significantly overestimated , and only slowly approaches its true value .",
    "at least part of the bias for reciprocity under bfs comes from the fact that we only include links in the growing front if they point back to the previously sampled graph .",
    "this introduces a bias to increase reciprocity .",
    "this type of overestimation is actually present at any sampling coverage for an additional reason : bfs sampling ( in most cases ) only gathers information about the gscc and out components , but not about the in and other components , and since reciprocal links always tie two nodes into one component , there are naturally more reciprocal links in the gscc than there are in other components as summarized in table  [ degree_reciprocity ] ; thus there is overrepresentation of bidirectional links , relative to the total number of links , and reciprocity is artificially high as shown most clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig : r](b ) for the google data .",
    "a set of assortativity measures  @xcite for directed networks are defined using the pearson correlation as follows : @xmath15 } { s^{(j)}_{x } s^{(k)}_{y } } , \\label{eq : assortativity}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 indexes each incoming and outgoing degree type and @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) is the @xmath19-degree ( @xmath20-degree ) of the _ tail _ ( _ head _ ) node for a link @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the set of sampled links ( all links , if we consider the complete network ) .",
    "@xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) is the weighted average degree  @xcite .",
    "the following relations hold in general : @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath26 is the standard deviation of the @xmath19-degree of the tail nodes ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "@xmath28 is similarly defined .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath29 .    in most cases , we find that the directed assortativities of the networks we study are not markedly different from zero , and it is therefore difficult to define a general tendency for the effects of bfs sampling on the statistics of assortativity .",
    "we do , however , point out that both @xmath30 and @xmath31 of the berkstan network are quite large ( but have opposite sign ) , suggesting that , unlike the rest of the networks , nodes of high out - degree tend to link to other nodes of high out - degree , but nodes of high out - degree tend to link with nodes of low in - degree .    while the small assortativities of the networks make it dangerous to draw broad conclusions regarding the effects of sampling ,",
    "it is clear that in the case of random sampling there is a clear tendency in behavior at low values of the sampling coverage , which seems to be related to the small reciprocity of the networks we study  @xcite .",
    "assortativity between the incoming degree and outgoing degree @xmath32 tends to be overestimated for small sampling coverage ; on the other hand , the incoming - incoming degree assortativity is underestimated ( implying greater disassortativity than is present in the complete networks ) as shown in figs .  [",
    "fig : assortativity](b ) and ( d ) .",
    "these trends seem to stem from a trivial situation : when the sampling coverage is small , many tail ( head ) nodes will have no incoming ( outgoing ) degree , even though they are connected to each other . consider two nodes , a and b , connected by a directed link from a to b. in this case , a has no incoming degree and b has no outgoing degree .",
    "thus the correlation between in- and out - degrees would be positive , whereas the correlation between incoming degrees would be negative .",
    "this would not be the case if a large fraction of nodes had reciprocal links .",
    "not surprisingly , these tendencies disappear very quickly as the sampling coverage increases .",
    "assortativity can be either overestimated or underestimated by bfs , depending on network structure and coverage",
    ". the real value of in - degree / in - degree assortativity is approached from below in wikipedia data ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : assortativity](a ) ) .",
    "when randomly picking the seeds for bfs , there is a high chance to select small @xmath33 nodes since incoming degree follows a scale - free distribution .",
    "nonetheless , bfs sampling soon reaches the large @xmath33 nodes .",
    "this results in a highly negative @xmath34 initially . as the sampling coverage increases , @xmath34 approaches its real value from below .",
    "however , we do not observe systematic behaviors for other assortativities under bfs .          as the sampling coverage increases , the number of sccs increases initially .",
    "since single nodes and nodes with only incoming links are considered sccs by definition , the number of sccs is proportional to the sampling coverage @xmath4 , both for random and bfs sampling .",
    "however , after a certain sampling coverage has been reached , newly - sampled nodes are more likely to connect to already - existing sccs .",
    "for most networks , this means that existing sccs will merge together , whence the total number of sccs will finally decrease .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sccs ] . for both sampling methods ,",
    "the number of sccs increases linearly with @xmath4 initially and then decreases to the value in the original networks for large @xmath4 .",
    "however , the number of sccs observed in bfs sampling is almost one order of magnitude less .",
    "since surface nodes are in contact with other components , there is a possibility that they will be absorbed into component cores or move into other components if we add nodes or links from the network .",
    "the ratio of nodes on the surface of a component to the total number of nodes in the component ( ` surface node ratio ' ) seems to depend strongly on the structure of the sccs of directed networks . of the networks we study ,",
    "the wikipedia graphs have the largest gsccs , with upwards of 67% of all nodes , and at least 43% of theses nodes are surface nodes .",
    "the stanford and berkstan networks gsccs are smaller ( 59% and 51% , respectively ) and contain very few surface nodes ( 7.4% and 9.6% , respectively )",
    ". a closer look at the in and out components of the stanford network reveals numerous chains and multinode ( directed ) cycles that offer only a single surface node for attachment to the gscc .",
    "figure  [ fig : surface ] shows the changes to surface node ratios as sampling coverage increases in the wiki2007 data .",
    "when the sampling coverage is small , the surface node ratio in the gscc does not change markedly under random sampling .",
    "after increasing the sampling coverage , however , the ratio decreases as the core becomes more densely connected with the addition of newly sampled nodes .",
    "however , the surface node ratio in the pwcc increases as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : surface](b ) as the disc and tend shrink quickly , becoming absorbed into the gscc , and then transforming into surface nodes .",
    "bfs sampling , on the other hand , shows a different trend .",
    "the surface node ratio in the gscc is lower than that in the pwcc .",
    "this seems to be deeply related with the fact that bfs sampling starts from seeds than expands their territory layer by layer .",
    "when the sampling coverage is small , the surface node ratio increases as the sampling coverage increases .",
    "after the sampling procedure has reached a certain point , the surface node ratio will also begin to decrease as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : surface](a ) .              here",
    "we focus both on the evolution of the bow - tie structure and on the component from which the nodes are sampled  noted in fig .",
    "[ fig : components](c ) and ( d ) as `` % sampled from the orig .",
    "comp.'' as the sampling coverage increases .",
    "bfs sampling mainly covers the gscc and out components , so the sizes of the in and tend components in the sampled networks remain constant as @xmath4 increases . as coverage increases , the size ratio of the gscc  the ratio of nodes in the current gscc to the total number of discovered nodes  increases slightly as the gscc absorbs other components .",
    "the main characteristics associated with random sampling are described by percolation phenomena  @xcite . when the sampling coverage is small , most of the nodes are disconnected and belong to the disc and tend components . as sampling coverage increases past some percolation threshold ,",
    "the gscc emerges quickly and the in and out components form concurrently as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : components](b ) .",
    "in summary , a comparison of bfs sampling to random sampling indicates that differences in sampling method and coverage can introduce biases that result in substantial mischaracterization of the statistics of many structural properties in directed networks .",
    "moreover , the extent to which sampling biases will affect these properties seems to depend heavily on the structure of the original network . in comparing random sampling to bfs sampling on seven different directed networks , including three versions of wikipedia , three different sources of sampled world wide web data , and an internet - based social network",
    ", we found that differences in sampling method and coverage affect both the bow - tie structure , as well as the number and surface structure of strongly connected components in sampled networks .",
    "in addition , at low sampling coverage ( less than 40% ) , the values of average degree , variance of in- and out - degree , degree auto - correlation , and link reciprocity in sampled networks are misestimated by at least 30% , and sometimes by as much as four orders of magnitude .",
    "the structural properties of bfs - sampled networks attain values within 10% of the corresponding values in the original networks only when sampling coverage is in excess of 65% .",
    "most biases under random sampling seem to stem from the fact that both out - degree and in - degree will be approximately equally undersampled .",
    "this leads to underestimation of average degree and variances of in- and out - degree . at the same time , properties such as reciprocity and auto - correlation are essentially constant because of this equality in undersampling .",
    "biases under bfs sampling arise from a confluence of factors : by following only outgoing links , bfs fails to cover the in - component of directed networks ; bfs covers nodes of high in - degree at early times ; the core of bfs - sampled networks are tangled with many loops showing high clustering ; the in- and out - degrees of nodes at the growing front are undersampled under bfs sampling . in combination , these factors ( and , possibly others ) lead to overestimation of some structural properties ( average degree , variance in out - degree , auto - correlation , and reciprocity ) and underestimation of others ( variance in in - degree , number of sccs , surface node ratios ) .",
    "we have demonstrated that for these reasons , if uniform random , or bfs sampling is used to assemble a network , significant corrections to degree , degree variance , auto - correlation , reciprocity , some types of assortativity and component make - up should be expected .",
    "though we have not examined it here , we suspect that there may be an important interplay between sampling method , sampling coverage , temporal changes , and sampled network topologies .",
    "the wikipedia data discussed earlier could be used to probe such effects , since it captures snapshots of wikipedia at different times during the network s evolution .",
    "it would be interesting to quantify differences in the effects ( if any ) of bfs and random sampling on time - varying or temporal networks  @xcite . a natural question , after analyzing the drawbacks of sampling procedures ,",
    "will be how we can overcome such problems to get unbiased network samplings .",
    "a possible solution could be a combination of random and bfs samplings to get several unbiased structural properties .",
    "however , it is still challenging work to get unbiased samplings for every network properties .",
    "there are several papers suggesting unbiased sampling strategies for specific properties  @xcite .",
    "the results presented in this paper have widespread implications for conclusions that have been drawn regarding the structure ( and function ) of some of the most ubiquitously studied real - world networks , including the world wide web . since for many studied real ,",
    "directed networks only an incomplete link list is available , either because the networks are too large to be fully recorded , or because they change too quickly to be captured by any sampling procedure , our findings call into question the accuracy of previous , reported results for the statistics of some of these networks structural properties .",
    "we may not know as much about the structure of very large directed networks as has been supposed .",

    "<S> for many real - world networks only a small  sampled \" version of the original network may be investigated ; those results are then used to draw conclusions about the actual system . </S>",
    "<S> variants of breadth - first search ( bfs ) sampling , which are based on epidemic processes , are widely used . </S>",
    "<S> although it is well established that bfs sampling fails , in most cases , to capture the in - component(s ) of directed networks , a description of the effects of bfs sampling on other topological properties are all but absent from the literature . to systematically study the effects of sampling biases on directed networks , we compare bfs sampling to random sampling on complete large - scale directed networks . </S>",
    "<S> we present new results and a thorough analysis of the topological properties of seven different complete directed networks ( prior to sampling ) , including three versions of wikipedia , three different sources of sampled world wide web data , and an internet - based social network . </S>",
    "<S> we detail the differences that sampling method and coverage can make to the structural properties of sampled versions of these seven networks . </S>",
    "<S> most notably , we find that sampling method and coverage affect both the bow - tie structure , as well as the number and structure of strongly connected components in sampled networks . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , at low sampling coverage ( _ i.e. _ less than 40% ) , the values of average degree , variance of out - degree , degree auto - correlation , and link reciprocity are overestimated by 30% or more in bfs - sampled networks , and only attain values within 10% of the corresponding values in the complete networks when sampling coverage is in excess of 65% . </S>",
    "<S> these results may cause us to rethink what we know about the structure , function , and evolution of real - world directed networks . </S>"
