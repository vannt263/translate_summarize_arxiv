    "in a recent paper @xcite we have set a systematic method to obtain sum rules ( sr ) in the heavy quark limit of qcd , that relate the derivatives of the elastic isgur - wise ( iw ) function @xmath2 to sums over iw functions of excited states . the method is based on the operator product expansion ( ope ) @xcite applied to heavy quark transitions @xcite and its key element is the consideration , following uraltsev @xcite , of the non - forward amplitude , i.e. @xmath9 with in general @xmath10 .",
    "then , the ope side of the sr contains the elastic iw function @xmath11 and therefore the sr depend in general on three variables @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 that lie within a certain domain . by differentiation",
    "relatively to these variables within the domain and taking the limit to its boundary , one finds a very general class of sr that have interesting consequences on the shape of @xmath2 .",

    "the reason is that only a finite number of @xmath0 states , with their radial excitations , contribute to the relevant sum rules and one is left with a relatively simple set of algebraic linear equations . as we will see , this is due to the crucial fact that we adopt particular conditions at the boundary of the domain ( [ 4e ] ) .",

    "a considerable effort has been developed to formulate dispersive constraints on the shape of the form factors in @xmath145 @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the starting point are the analyticity properties of two - point functions and positivity of the corresponding spectral functions .",
    "then , dispersion relations relate the hadronic spectral functions to the qcd two - point functions in the deep euclidean region , and positivity allows to bounds the contribution of the relevant states , leading to constraints on the semileptonic form factors .",
    "we will now compare our method , that gives information on the derivatives of the isgur - wise function , with the dispersive approach .    a first remark to be made",
    "is that our approach , based on bjorken - like sr , holds _ in the physical region _ of the semileptonic decays @xmath146 and _ in the heavy quark limit_. however , concerning this last simplifying feature , we should underline that there is no objection of principle to include in the calculation radiative corrections and subleading corrections in powers of @xmath143 .",
    "the dispersive approach starts from bounds _ in the crossed channel _ by comparison of the ope and the sum over hadrons coupled to the corresponding current , @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 then , one analytically continues to the physical region of the semileptonic decays .",

    "@xmath151 , @xmath152 . ratios of the remaining form factors to @xmath153 are computed _ in the physical region _ by introducing @xmath143 and @xmath154 corrections to the heavy quark limit .",
    "the dispersive approach considers _ physical quark masses _ , in contrast with the heavy quark limit of our method .",
    "the two approaches are quite different in spirit and in their results .",
    "however , it can be interesting to compare numerically our bounds with the ones of the dispersive approach , as they happen to be complementary",
    ". we must however keep in mind precisely the differences between the two methods .",
    "we have demonstrated in @xcite that the iw function @xmath2 is an alternating series in powers of @xmath155 , with the moduli of the derivatives satisfying the bounds ( [ 11 ] ) and ( [ 58e ] ) .",
    "let us consider the main results of ref .",
    "@xcite , that are summarized by the one - parameter formula    [ equation2 ] v_1(w ) v_1(1 ) 1 - 8 ^2 z + ( 51 ^ 2 - 10)z^2 - ( 252 ^2 - 84 ) z^3    with the variable @xmath156 defined by    [ equation3 ] z = - +    and the allowed range for @xmath70 being    [ equation4 ] - 0.17 < ^2 < 1.51  .",
    "of course , the function @xmath157 contains finite mass corrections that are absent at present in our method .",
    "nevertheless , let us first compare these results with our lower bounds ( [ 11 ] ) , assuming the rough approximation    [ equation5 ] v_1(w ) v_1(1 ) ( w )  .    of course",

    "the lower bound ( [ equation4 ] ) on @xmath70 is very weak  : there is a region for @xmath70 that is below the bjorken bound @xmath162 , and this reflects on the regions allowed for the higher derivatives . of course",
    ", we must always keep in mind that in these considerations we are neglecting finite mass and @xmath154 corrections .",
    "moreover , one should notice that the series is not alternate in the whole range ( [ equation4 ] ) .",
    "we have verified analytically that the expression ( [ equation2 ] ) is an alternate series in powers of @xmath36 for values of @xmath163 , i.e. for @xmath70 satisfying precisely bjorken bound .",
    "it is not clear to us whether this is just a numerical coincidence or it has a deeper significance , i.e. if it extends to the complete series in powers of @xmath158 .",
    "let us now comment on the implications of our bounds ( [ 11 ] ) .",
    "the first important remark is that , within the simplifying hypothesis ( [ equation5 ] ) , the range ( [ equation4 ] ) is considerably tightened by the lower bound on @xmath101 implied by bjorken and uraltsev sum rules .",
    "therefore , we will consider hereafter , instead of ( [ equation4 ] ) , the improved range    [ ( 3 ) ] 3 4 ^2 < 1.51    that shows that our type of lower bounds are complementary to the upper bounds obtained from dispersive methods . within the hypothesis of the heavy quark limit ,",
    "the region allowed by the dispersive bounds for @xmath2 with @xmath70 within the range ( [ equation4 ] ) is obviously much reduced by the bounds ( [ ( 3 ) ] ) ( fig .",
    "2 ) .    on the other hand",

    "therefore , for values of @xmath70 that are within the range ( [ ( 3 ) ] ) , these inequalities are _ a fortiori _ satisfied , but they are not satisfied in the whole range ( [ equation4 ] ) .",
    "finally , let us look for the implications of our improved bound on the curvature , eq .",
