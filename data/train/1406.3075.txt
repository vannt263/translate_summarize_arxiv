    "the study of the impact of behavioural responses on the progression of infectious diseases in human populations has received a lot of interest during the last years .",
    "an important challenge is how to capture features of human behaviour in epidemic modelling @xcite . in a broad sense ,",
    "when dealing with sexually transmitted diseases , a high heterogeneity in the number of contacts reflects the high variability of individuals behaviour @xcite .",
    "but , in addition to this relevant aspect , individual responses adopted to reduce the perceived risk of contagion constitute another facet of human behaviour that greatly impacts the dynamics of an epidemic .",
    "social avoidance behaviours , for instance , were prevalent in hong kong during the sars pandemic and , also , at the initial stage of the h1n1 epidemic @xcite .",
    "avoidance of contacts with infectious individuals is another example of behavioural plasticity .",
    "this social distancing leads to the idea of link rewiring and is one of the basis of adaptive networks in which the structure of the contact pattern evolves with the progression of the epidemic @xcite .",
    "disease - avoiding rewiring implicitly assumes the local knowledge and transmission of information which allows individuals to assess the status of their nearest neighbours .",
    "another way to capture information transmission is by accounting for the difference in how information about the disease is processed and acted upon .",
    "for example , it is reasonable to assume that risk perception is heterogeneous across a population , meaning that those who are more risk averse are more likely to adopt preventive measures against contagion .",
    "such individuals have been labelled as _ alert _ or _",
    "aware _ in the specialist literature .",
    "some models consider that both susceptible and infectious individuals can be in either of two states : aware / responsive and unaware / non - responsive @xcite .",
    "if information dissemination is explicitly taken into account , new layers are added to the basic contact network .",
    "this extension results in dealing with overlapping or multiplex networks where the disease and information dissemination networks overlap to different levels @xcite .",
    "predictions from these approaches vary and depend on the particular modelling assumptions .",
    "for instance , in @xcite the authors assume a decreasing quality of the information and fading of awareness and claim that , below a critical infection rate , awareness and a lower susceptibility of aware individuals lead to a reduction in the basic reproduction number @xmath0 of a susceptible - infectious - recovered ( sir ) model .",
    "interestingly , this claim follows under an individual - based approach but not from a mean - field analysis .",
    "a similar conclusion is obtained in @xcite from a mean - field model which assumes that both susceptible and infectious individuals can be either responsive or non - responsive against the disease . in this setting , a contact - based transmission of information can change , under suitable conditions , the epidemic threshold and prevent the spread of the disease .",
    "the approach that motivates our study is the one introduced in @xcite . in these papers , the authors assume a new class of individuals , the aware or alerted ones , which are non - infectious individuals with a reduced susceptibility .",
    "awareness arises in susceptible individuals when they have infectious neighbours , that is , from a contact - based transmission of information .",
    "aware individuals can get infected at a lower infection rate compared to fully susceptible ones , due to the adoption of preventive measures . formulating the network epidemic model in terms of an approximation of the exact markov processes ,",
    "the authors prove the existence of a second threshold ( different from the classic disease - invasion one ) for the preventive response to suppress epidemic spreading .",
    "certainly , this is a result that has not been observed in previous modelling approaches and seems to give an important role to aware people at the beginning of the epidemic .",
    "the aim of this paper is to give a simple but full interpretation of the existence of such an epidemic threshold using a mean - field approach to the original equations .",
    "in contrast to previous results ( see , for instance , @xcite ) , in sections [ model ] and [ sais - rn ] we show that the mean - field model captures the dynamics of the whole system and leads to the same epidemic thresholds as the network model for fully connected and regular random networks .",
    "therefore , it offers a simple and complete description of the epidemic dynamics ( section [ sais - no - decay ] ) .",
    "in particular , this mean - field formulation allows us to prove by means of peixoto s theorem ( see @xcite ) that the original model introduced in @xcite defined on regular random networks is structurally unstable because it has a continuum of equilibria and , so , the qualitative behaviour of its solutions can change with a small and smooth perturbation of its equations . in section [ sais - with - decay ] , we show that including an awareness decay leads to the disappearance of the second epidemic threshold , and to the appearance of oscillations around an endemic equilibrium instead of the occurrence of minor outbreaks associated to an slow die - out of the epidemic @xcite .",
    "the analysis of many real outbreak episodes , such as the sars epidemic in hong - kong in 2003 and hiv / aids , provide clear evidence of awareness decay over time .",
    "namely , for the former , fewer people are wearing face masks when they have a cold / flu and washing their hands regularly . while for the latter , there are still a large number of individuals adopting risky behaviours despite the heightened level of awareness and prevention campaigns @xcite .",
    "thus , the inclusion of awareness decay is an important model ingredient and needs to be accounted for .",
    "we consider a population of size @xmath1 for which an individual @xmath2 can be in one of the following states : @xmath3 , @xmath4 , or @xmath5 , where capital letters denote the _ susceptible _ , _ infectious _ , or _ aware / alert _ states , respectively .",
    "we also consider the following parameters    * per - contact infection rate for susceptible individuals , @xmath6 , * per - contact infection rate for aware individuals , @xmath7 , * per - contact awareness rate for susceptible individuals , @xmath8 , * recovery rate for infectious individuals , @xmath9 , * rate of awareness decay for aware individuals , @xmath10 ,    together with the following rules for the epidemic / awareness evolution : @xmath11 finally , to reflect the fact that aware individuals get infected at a lower rate than unaware ( susceptible ) ones , we will assume @xmath12 when necessary . from a mathematical point of view , this hypothesis restricts the possible behaviours of the solutions of the model and will prevent us from results which do not make biological sense .",
    "an example of these results happens for @xmath13 if @xmath14 because , then , it is possible to have a stable endemic equilibrium which is sustained thanks to a higher susceptibility ( @xmath15 ) of aware individuals .    if @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 are the probabilities for node @xmath2 to be susceptible , infectious , and aware , respectively , @xmath19 is the joint probability for node",
    "@xmath2 being susceptible and for a neighbour @xmath20 being infectious ( and similarly for @xmath21 ) , and @xmath22 is the adjacency matrix of the contact network , the exact model for the setup above in a continuous - time setting is given by : @xmath23 where , for sake of generality in the presentation , the transmission rates @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are assumed to be dependent on the involved pair @xmath27 of individuals . in what follows , we ignore @xmath28 , since @xmath29 for @xmath30 .",
    "this is not a closed or self - consistent system as further equations for the pairs are needed . to avoid this dependence on higher order moments ,",
    "let us assume that the joint probability can be written as @xmath31 ( or @xmath32 ) , that is , it is independent of the neighbourhood configuration of node @xmath2 and node @xmath20 .",
    "assuming the same rates @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 of transmission across a contact and the same recovery and awareness decay rates , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , for all the nodes , denoting @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and dropping the time dependence for simplicity , the model reads : @xmath40 for @xmath41 .",
    "for @xmath42 , these equations define the so - called sais epidemic model considered in @xcite .",
    "in order to give a simple interpretation of the the epidemic thresholds obtained in @xcite , from now on we will restrict ourselves to regular random networks , that is , networks where all the nodes have the same number of neighbours ( degree ) , @xmath43 , which are randomly chosen among the nodes in the network .",
    "our approach will also embrace fully connected networks ( @xmath44 ) . in this paper",
    ", we will not focus on the goodness of the mean - field approximation @xmath31 and @xmath32 , i.e. we will not investigate or quantify the error introduced by this closure .",
    "it is well know that such closures for particular dynamics and network topologies give a good approximation meaning that the exact model , via a gillespie simulation , is well approximated by the closed model @xcite .    since the degree is the only feature that characterizes a node , in this type of networks",
    "there is no reason to assume that some nodes have higher vulnerabilities than others .",
    "this means that it is reasonable to assume that any node of the network can get infected with the same initial probability @xmath45 , and that the probability of being initially aware is also the same for all the nodes , namely , @xmath46 . under this uniform initial condition for @xmath47 and @xmath48 , the following lemma states that these probabilities vary with time but are the same for any node in the network .",
    "[ equiv ] consider the initial value problem ( ivp ) given by system defined on regular random networks and endowed with the initial condition @xmath49 and @xmath50 for @xmath51 , and such that @xmath52 .",
    "the solution of this ivp is given by @xmath53 @xmath54 with @xmath55 being the solution of the system @xmath56 endowed with the initial condition @xmath57 .",
    "proof_. it is clear that if @xmath58 @xmath54 then @xmath59 @xmath54 because each node has exactly @xmath43 neighbours , each one of them being infectious with probability @xmath60 . after introducing the value of this sum into system , it follows that @xmath55 must satisfy with @xmath57 to be a solution to the ivp .    on the other hand",
    ", the standard theory of odes guarantees the existence and uniqueness of a local solution of the ivp defined by system , endowed with a non - negative initial condition @xmath61 @xmath62 , since the right - hand side ( rhs ) of system is quadratic in @xmath47 and @xmath48 and , hence , it is locally lipschitz .",
    "moreover , for @xmath41 and @xmath63\\times [ 0,1]$ ] , it immediately follows that @xmath64 , @xmath65 . finally , adding the equations of system for each @xmath2",
    ", we get @xmath66 .",
    "the region @xmath67^{2n } | \\ , 0 \\le p_i+q_i \\le 1 \\ , \\forall i\\}$ ] is then positively invariant , which guarantees that the local solution can be extended to any @xmath68 for any initial condition in @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , @xmath58 @xmath54 with @xmath55 satisfying with @xmath57 turns out to be the unique global solution of the ivp .",
    "@xmath70    from this lemma",
    "it follows that , under a uniform initial condition , the average number of infectious and aware individuals at time @xmath71 is given by @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "then , we can consider the ( expected ) fractions of susceptible and aware individuals , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , as state variables instead of working with the nodal probabilities of being infectious and aware .",
    "indeed , @xmath76 and @xmath77 . in terms of @xmath78 and @xmath79 ,",
    "system can be rewritten as : @xmath80 where , as usual in mean - field models , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 are transmission rates per node and not per contact .    system   constitutes an extension of the sis model on regular networks @xcite .",
    "remarkably , system   has been derived without summing the equations for @xmath84 and @xmath85 in with respect to @xmath2 , which allow us to prove that both formulations have equivalent solutions under uniformly random initial infections , even for networks that are not fully connected ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "note that , even for fully connected networks , the assumption of uniformly random initial conditions is required for a complete equivalence of the formulations , as it was observed in @xcite for the sis model . in other words , we have shown that mean - field epidemic models on regular networks do not underestimate the rate of infection obtained from the full system when we restrict ourselves to uniformly random initial conditions , as it was claimed for the sis model on regular networks with @xmath87 when it was compared to the corresponding full ( intertwined ) system ( cf .",
    "vii in @xcite ) . in figure",
    "[ mf - vs - intertwined ] we compare the solutions of both models under uniformly random and clustered initial conditions on networks of size @xmath88 and degree 5 . as proved in the previous lemma , the time evolution of the fraction of infectious individuals predicted by both models is exactly the same when @xmath89 .",
    "in contrast , this figure also shows that , when we initially infect the neighbours of 20 randomly selected nodes ( clustered infections ) , and aware individuals are not present , system overestimates the early epidemic growth . in both models , however , the solutions tend to the same equilibrium point .",
    "following these findings , we now turn our attention to the analysis of two mean - field models .",
    "namely , the mean - field model corresponding to the information transmission model proposed in @xcite , and an extended version of it , which accounts for the decay of awareness . in the following two sections , we will give a detailed bifurcation analysis of both , and we will show that the two - threshold feature ( i.e. the classic invasion threshold not involving information and the die - out threshold delimiting the persistence from the eventual die - out following a minor outbreak ) of the first model disappears via a degenerate transition upon including awareness decay .",
    "moreover , our analysis will show that the qualitative bifurcation picture from the mean - field model maps exactly to the behaviour obtained from the full model , as detailed in @xcite .",
    "let us begin with the mean - field equations obtained from with @xmath42 , namely , @xmath90 where @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 are transmission rates per node .        1",

    "proof_. statements @xmath100 and @xmath101 directly follow from the analysis of the vector field defined by .",
    "in particular , evaluating it on the left and bottom boundaries of @xmath102 we obtain that @xmath103 @xmath104 and @xmath105 @xmath106 , respectively , which means that trajectories can not leave @xmath102 through these boundaries .",
    "statement @xmath107 follows from the fact that , for those points @xmath108 such that @xmath109 , we can divide the second equation of by the first one to obtain a non - homogeneous first order linear equation for @xmath110 , namely , @xmath111 this equation can be integrated and its general solution is given by .",

    "two different situations must be considered .",

    ": trajectories move to the right and @xmath145 . for @xmath146 , trajectories move to the left and it can be shown along the same lines that the slope of the trajectories @xmath147 .",
    "so , also in this second case , trajectories cross the lines @xmath141 , @xmath142 , only once .",
    "note that @xmath148 is a vertical straight line and corresponds to the nullcline @xmath149 and , hence , trajectories can not cross it .",
    "therefore , in both cases the sum @xmath150 tends to 1 monotonously along trajectories because of the invariance of @xmath102 ( lemma [ basic - nodecay ] ) .",
    "that is , trajectories tend monotonously to @xmath116 , which means that no minor outbreaks are possible .    in statement @xmath101",
