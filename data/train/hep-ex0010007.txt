    "in order to measure @xmath7 , observed neutrino events must be separated into charged current ( cc ) and neutral current ( nc ) categories .",
    "both cc and nc neutrino interactions initiate a cascade of hadrons in the target that is registered in both the scintillation counters and drift chambers . however , muon neutrino cc events are distinguished by the presence of a final state muon , which typically penetrates well beyond the hadronic shower and deposits energy in a large number of consecutive scintillation counters .",
    "these differing event topologies enable the statistical separation of cc and nc interactions based solely on event length ( _ i.e. _ , on the presence or absence of a muon in an event ) .",
    "events with a long length ( spanning more than 20 counters ) are identified as cc candidates ; those with a short length ( spanning less than 20 counters ) as nc candidates .",
    "the experimental quantity measured in both neutrino and antineutrino modes is the ratio :    @xmath13    the ratios of short to long events ( @xmath14 ) measured in the nutev data are 0.4198 @xmath15 0.0008 in the neutrino beam and 0.4215 @xmath15 0.0017 in the antineutrino beam .",
    "a standard model value of @xmath7 can be directly extracted from these measured ratios by using a detailed monte carlo simulation of the experiment .",
    "the monte carlo must include the integrated neutrino fluxes , the neutrino cross section , and a detailed description of the nutev detector .",
    "more detailed information on the specific components of the monte carlo simulation can be found elsewhere @xcite .    using our separate high - purity neutrino and antineutrino data sets , nutev measures the following linear combination of @xmath16 and @xmath17 :    @xmath18    the value for _ x _",
    "is selected using the monte carlo in order to minimize uncertainties related to charm quark production .",
    "the single remaining free parameter in the monte carlo , @xmath7 , is then varied until the model calculation of @xmath19 agrees with what is measured in the data .",
    "the preliminary result from the nutev data sample for @xmath20=175 gev and @xmath21=150 gev is :    @xmath22    having chosen the convention @xmath23 , and given the well - determined z mass from lep , our result implies :    @xmath24    our measurement is in good agreement with standard model expectations , and is consistent with current measurements from w and z production as well as from other neutrino experiments ( figures [ fig : mw ] , [ fig : mt - mw ] ) .",
    "the data tend to collectively favor a light higgs mass .",
    "the central value from recent global fits to all precision data is @xmath25 gev with an upper bound of @xmath26 gev at 95% cl @xcite .",
    "outside the standard model , deviations between electroweak measurements in @xmath27 scattering and those from other processes are sensitive to new physics . in these proceedings we discuss two such possibilities : neutrino oscillations and extra neutral vector gauge bosons .",
    "+ the presence of neutrino oscillations will directly shift our measured ratios , @xmath28 , from their standard model predictions . since @xmath29 s oscillating to either @xmath30 s or @xmath31 s would be less likely to produce a final state muon",
    ", we would expect to observe an excess of short events .",
    "since no such excess is observed , single mode ( @xmath32 or @xmath33 ) limits can be set for both @xmath34 and @xmath35 oscillations .",
    "one advantage to this type of search is that the paschos - wolfenstein quantity , r@xmath11 , is particularly sensitive to cp - violating oscillations because it is formed from a difference in neutrino and antineutrino rates . as a result ,",
    "nutev is presently the only experiment with direct limits on @xmath36 .",
    "more details on this analysis can be found elsewhere @xcite . + extra z bosons ( z@xmath37 ) are of interest not only because they are predicted by many grand unified theories and superstring models , but also in light of recent experimental developments .",
    "erler and langacker have shown in a recent global fit that the precision electroweak data are better described if an extra tev - scale z boson is included @xcite .",
    "of course , a large portion of this improvement arises from the fact that the 2.5 @xmath38 deviation of the new atomic parity violation ( apv ) measurement @xcite from the standard model prediction can be explained by including an additional z boson @xcite .    in our case ,",
    "extra z bosons would manifest themselves as shifts in the neutrino - quark couplings away from their standard model values .",
    "these shifts can arise from both pure - z@xmath37 exchange as well as from z - z@xmath37 mixing contributions .",
    "if we consider constraints on extra z bosons in @xmath39 models , then these coupling shifts are well - determined @xcite . in this case ,",
    "the lightest extra z boson is a linear combination of the so(10 ) singlet @xmath40 and the su(5 ) singlet @xmath41 :    @xmath42    expressed in terms of a free parameter @xmath43 .",
    "our data tend to disfavor the inclusion of additional z bosons , so we set a 95% cl lower limit on the mass of such an extra @xmath44 plotted as a function of @xmath43 ( figure [ fig : zprime1 ] ) .",
    "limits are displayed for two cases : the @xmath44 has no mixing with the standard model z , and the more realistic case that allows for some level of mixing . for the latter , we input the z pole data constraint that the level of z-@xmath44 mixing is small ( @xmath45 ) @xcite .",
    "note that the inclusion of z-@xmath44 mixing , even at this small level , weakens the limits . at 95% cl and",
    "assuming a 10@xmath46 level of z-@xmath44 mixing , we set lower mass limits of 675 and 380 gev for the @xmath40 and @xmath47 respectively .",
    "direct searches have already excluded masses below @xmath12 600 gev @xcite .    as can be seen from figure [ fig : zprime1 ] ,",
    "our maximum sensitivity is to the @xmath40 , and our exclusion peaks in the most viable region suggested by the apv data .",
    "figure [ fig : zprime2 ] shows a direct comparison of the region nutev excludes in z@xmath48 mass-@xmath43 space to the favored central value from the apv data analyses @xcite .",
    "nutev has successfully completed its data taking and has extracted a value of @xmath7 .",
    "the precision of this result represents a factor of two improvement over previous measurements in @xmath27 scattering , because of reduced uncertainties associated with measuring the paschos - wolfenstein ratio , @xmath19 .",
    "interpreted within the framework of the standard model , this result is equivalent to a determination of the w mass and is consistent with direct measurements of @xmath49 . outside the standard model , this measurement can be used to set limits on neutrino oscillations as well as extra neutral vector gauge bosons ."
