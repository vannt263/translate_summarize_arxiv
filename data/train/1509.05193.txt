    "the classic case is ic  3599 where a giant x - ray and uv flare , which repeated after 20 years , has been alternatively explained by tidal stripping of an orbiting star @xcite or by an accretion disc instability @xcite .",
    "ngc  3599 ( @xmath3 = @xmath4 , @xmath5 = @xmath6 , z=@xmath7 ) was discovered in an xmm-_newton _ slew from 2003 with a soft x - ray flux a factor @xmath8 higher than an upper limit from _ rosat _ @xcite .",
    "subsequent observations of the galaxy by xmm-_newton _ , _ chandra _ and _ swift _ revealed a strong decay in flux by a factor @xmath9 over the following years @xcite .",
    "the galaxy shows weak , narrow , optical lines leading to its classification as a liner or seyfert 2 galaxy @xcite .",
    "three scenarios were proposed at the time to explain the flare : a tde , agn variability and an ultra - luminous x - ray source ( ulx ; based on the relatively low x - ray luminosity , @xmath10 a few @xmath11 ergs / s ) . in this paper",
    "we reassess these possibilities based on newly discovered high - state and more recent low - state data .",
    "in particular we investigate whether the flare could be due to an accretion disc instability , similar to that proposed for flares seen in certain galactic accreting binaries @xcite .",
    "we also look at recent advances in numerical and analytical modelling of tde lightcurves @xcite , which show a generally slower rise to peak flux than that predicted by the classical model @xcite .    a @xmath12cdm cosmology with ( @xmath13 )",
    "= ( 0.27 , 0.73 ) and @xmath14=70 km@xmath1s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 has been assumed throughout .",
    "ngc  3599 was reported as a candidate tidal disruption event , based on an x - ray flare seen in an xmm-_newton _ slew from 2003 - 11 - 22 @xcite .",
    "the source flux was @xmath15 times higher than that seen in a _",
    "rosat _ pointed observation from 1993 @xcite .",
    "the galaxy was sparsely monitored post - flare by xmm-_newton _ , _ swift _ and chandra revealing a decline in x - ray flux of a factor 100 from the peak value @xcite and a shape that can be reasonably fit by a canonical @xmath16 curve , appropriate for the rate of return of tidal debris to the disruption radius @xcite .",
    "a chandra observation from 2008 pinpointed the emission to be within 60 pc of the nucleus @xcite .",
    "optical spectra were taken in 2007 and 2008 and found to be consistent with a pre - flare spectrum @xcite .",
    "after subtraction of the galactic contribution , weak , narrow , low - ionisation lines remain whose ratios lie on the border between liner and low - luminosity agn activity @xcite .",
    "the luminosity of the narrow [ oiii]@xmath175007 line was @xmath18 ergs s@xmath1 implying a historical bolometric luminosity , @xmath19 ergs s@xmath1 applying the standard correction factor for low - luminosity agn @xcite . during the flare the soft x - ray luminosity was @xmath20 ergs s@xmath1 .",
    "no simultaneous data are available from other wavelengths making the calculation of @xmath21 at peak quite uncertain .",
    "based on the reasonable assumption that the soft x - ray flux was dominated by thermal disc emission , as suggested by the very soft spectrum @xcite , then a large fraction of the peak bolometric luminosity may be emitted in the soft x - rays .",
    "even so this implies an increase in @xmath22 from the historical to the peak luminosity .",
    "improvements to the xmm-_newton _ science analysis software ( sas ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have recently allowed some archival slew data to be processed for the first time . amongst these was the slew 9045100003 , which passed over ngc  3599 in 2002 - 05 - 22 .",

    "the source , then , was already bright 18 months before the peak flux was measured and more than a year before the date of the presumed disruption itself , derived by fitting a canonical @xmath16 curve to the x - ray measurements @xcite .",

    "we have analysed the _ rosat _ observation of 1993 - 06 - 06 ( rp600263n00 ) and identify ngc  3599 with the catalogued source , 1wga  j1115.4 + 1807 , with a count rate of @xmath24 c / s .",
    "this equates to a flux 130 times lower than that seen in 2002 - 05 - 22 .",
    "@xcite showed that the xmm-_newton _ and _ chandra _ observations all had soft spectra and could be simultaneously fit with a black - body of @xmath25 ev plus a steep power - law , with @xmath26 , both absorbed by the galactic column ( @xmath27@xmath28 ; * ? ? ?",
    "we fit this model , with free black - body temperature and power - law slope , to each individual observation , in fig  [ fig : hplot ] , and display the hardness ratio as a function of source flux .",

    "the event in ngc  3599 plateaus between 2002 - 05 - 22 and 2003 - 11 - 22 and then declines sharply at a rate compatible with @xmath16 .",
    "this behaviour is quite different from the light curves of previous , well - monitored , tde . in principle",
    ", the event in ngc  3599 could still be a tidal disruption event , similar to the ones previously observed , if the 2002 - 05 - 22 measurement lies on the rise of the luminosity curve and the 2003 - 11 - 22 measurement on the decline .",
    "@xcite obtained a date for the onset of the monotonic decline of the luminosity curve , @xmath38 .",
    "if we adopt a minimum start date of 2003.53 then the new slew data predate the decline from peak by 1.14 years .",
    "if this _ were _ a tidal disruption , then the rise time , plus the time where the debris fall back rate is maintained near maximum , is @xmath39 years ; significantly longer than seen in previous tde candidates .",
    "this excludes the possibility that the flare in ngc  3599 was caused by a classical , _ prompt _ ( fast - rising ) , tde .    a slow , factor 5 , flux decay in the tde candidate , rbs  1032 ,",
    "was observed in rosat observations spanning 3.5 years @xcite .",
    "these measurements may represent a flat , extended peak emission .",
    "they are , however , consistent with a canonical @xmath16 decline curve first detected @xmath40 year after peak @xcite .",
    "recently , numerical simulations and new analytical work have shown that the development of a tde light curve is dependent on when the streams of tidal debris intersect each other @xcite .",
    "early interactions appear to be rare and in the majority of cases circularisation occurs late and at a large distance from the bh , 510 times further away than predicted by the classical model @xcite .",
    "this leads to a longer viscous timescale and a rise to peak that takes months , years or even decades @xcite , especially when @xmath41@xmath42 .",
    "@xcite found a black hole mass for ngc  3599 of @xmath43@xmath42 from the @xmath44 relation and @xmath45@xmath42 from the relationship with the absolute v magnitude of the galaxy given by @xcite .",
    "a further measure of @xmath46@xmath42 is available from the k luminosity of the galaxy bulge @xcite , giving a full range of possible black hole masses , @xmath47@xmath42 .",
    "the discussion above addresses the complete disruption of a main sequence star .",
    "evolved stars have weakly - bound envelopes which may be stripped in black - hole encounters without destroying the star @xcite .",
    "these events , which result in light curves with a long rise to peak and a plateau phase lasting years , may be difficult to distinguish from a late circularisation after the disruption of a main sequence star .    as @xcite point out , the fact that we have only seen _",
    "so far is likely to be a selection effect as _ delayed _ ( slow - rising , long - plateau ) tde , which achieve lower peak luminosities than prompt tde @xcite , being less spectacular , are more difficult to detect in transient surveys .",
    "this may be the reason why they have not been seen yet in optical surveys or during the _ rosat _ mission .",
    "the comparison of xmm-_newton _ and _ rosat _ observations gives a baseline which currently stretches to 25 years and is hence not biased against slow - rising tde .",
    "@xcite identified a small number of new tde candidates by comparing _",
    "rosat _ and xmm-_newton",
    "_ pointed observation source fluxes .",
    "of these , only rbs  1032 ( discussed above ) had sufficient rosat observations to be able to detect a potential delayed tde .",
    "ngc  3599 could then be one of the first detections of a _ delayed _ tidal disruption event .",
    "the peak luminosity of ngc  3599 , @xmath48 ergs s@xmath1 , falls within the range attained by ulx @xcite . some arguments against a ulx interpretation for the flare in ngc  3599 were presented in @xcite ; we summarise these here and add new analysis .    a low - state _ chandra _ observation revealed two x - ray sources within the galaxy .",
    "a brighter one , coincident with the nucleus , with a 90% confidence error of 60 pc , and a fainter source , with @xmath49 ergs s@xmath1 , at a distance of 250 pc . the xmm-_newton _ pointed observation of 2006 had a flux 6 times higher than the _ chandra _ observation and is coincident with the nucleus with a 1-sigma error of 60 pc , excluding the possibility that the fainter _",
    "chandra _ source caused the variability .",
    "the luminosity of the _ chandra _ nuclear source is consistent with that expected from the optical emission lines , hence it is highly likely that this represents the low - level agn in its normal historical state",
    "chandra _ source has an unusually steep spectrum , similar to that seen in the xmm-_newton _ observations ( a power - law with @xmath50 plus a black body of kt=44 ev ; * ? ? ?",
    "stellar - mass accreting binaries and ulx have significantly harder low - state spectra than this ( e.g. @xmath51 was found for the low - luminosity observations of hlx-1 ; * ? ? ? * ) . for these reasons we locate the flare in the galactic nucleus rather than from a nearby ulx .      in section 2",
    "we saw that ngc  3599 is a low - luminosity seyfert / liner and it is worth re - considering the possibility of an agn flare in the light of the new data .",
    "any agn variability mechanism needs to explain the following characteristics of the flare in ngc  3599 : ( i ) an increase of factor 130 in x - ray flux within @xmath2 years ; ( ii ) an unusually soft peak spectrum ( @xmath52 / kt@xmath53 ev ) ; ( iii ) a spectrum which remained soft while the flux dropped by a factor 100 between 2003 and 2008 .",
    "no obvious intrinsic absorption was found in the low - state _ chandra _ and xmm-_newton _ spectra @xcite . as a further test , we investigated the possibility that the decline in flux in ngc  3599 is due to a variable warm absorber by fitting the two pointed xmm-_newton _ observations from 2006 and 2008 simultaneously , with a fixed power - law model and an ionized absorber ( zxipcf ) which was allowed to vary .",
    "the best fit was poor , with @xmath54 , ruling out that the source variability is caused by a single phase absorbing medium .",
    "warm absorbers , when looked at with sufficient spectral resolution , often appear to be multi - phased , containing gas at different distances and ionisation states ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the ngc  3599 spectra have neither the spectral resolution nor statistics to be able to exclude variable multiple absorbers .",
    "however , such a scenario would not explain why the peak luminosity , during the xmm-_newton _ slew observations , was @xmath55 times higher than the historical bolometric luminosity nor why the spectrum remained soft while the flux reduced by a factor 100 . from this",
    "we infer that the source experienced an increase in intrinsic emission rather than a variation in a patchy absorber .",
    "a change in the distribution of matter , involving a filling and emptying of the inner accretion disc , has been invoked to explain long - lived changes in the emission state of solar - mass black - hole binaries ( bhb ; * ? ? ?",
    "the time @xmath56 taken for material to migrate from a truncation radius and fill the inner disc up to the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) is governed by the viscous time scale and can be calculated from the mass of material in this inner region and the accretion rate , such that :    @xmath57    the mass of the inner disc being given by :    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is the radius of the isco , @xmath60 is the truncation radius , @xmath61 is the disc density and h(r ) its height .    for a shakura - sunyaev thin disc @xcite ,",

    "[ fig : timefill_a ] we plot @xmath56 against the truncation radius for @xmath77 ranging between @xmath78 and @xmath79 m@xmath80 , assuming that the accretion rate is eddington limited ( @xmath81 ) , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "we see that it is possible to fill the inner disc in @xmath84 months for a limited range of @xmath85 and @xmath60 . to further constrain @xmath86",
    "we estimate the size of the inner disc which will have 130 times more thermal 0.22 kev flux than the outer disc , i.e. which would duplicate the change in flux between the 1993 _ rosat _ and the 2002 xmm-_newton _ slew observations . here",
    "we used a novikov - thorne disc @xcite with colour corrections as described in @xcite .",
    "these constraints for @xmath87@xmath42 , covering the range estimated for the nuclear black hole of ngc  3599 , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : timefill_a ] .",
    "no solution is possible for @xmath60 and @xmath85 , within the allowed mass range , which allows the flux to rise sufficiently quickly if the emission comes from a thin disc .",
    "the possibility of an off - nuclear , lower mass black hole , was discussed in section 3.2 . in the bhb ,",
    "grs  1915 + 105 , soft flares are seen with a rise and decay time of seconds , an order of magnitude too fast to be explained by a complete filling and emptying of an inner disc on the viscous time scale , even though spectrally this is a very attractive solution @xcite . to explain these very fast spectral / flux variations ,",
    "the lightman - eardley ( le ) disc instability has been invoked @xcite . in this scenario , each flare ( preceded by a quiescent phase ) constitutes a cycle with different phases .",
    "* quiescent phase : during this phase the disc is truncated at a certain radius , with the central region either empty or filled with gas whose radiation is too soft to be detected .",
    "slowly , the disc is refilled by a steady accretion rate @xmath88 from the outer regions . *",
    "rise phase : at some point the radiation pressure in the inner disc exceeds the gas pressure . this causes a chain reaction ( due to the le disc instability ) that switches on the inner disc ( that has been now refilled and has the form of a slim hot disc ) . during this phase",
    "the flux from the source rises quickly and becomes much softer .",
    "* outburst phase ( _ plateau _ ) : now the disc extends down to an orbit that is very close to or coincident with the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) and a smaller hot radius can be observed . during this phase",
    "the emission is dominated by the thermal contribution from the disc , that is now hot and bright .",
    "the time - scale governing this phase is unknown , even though @xcite noticed that the duration of the outburst phase correlates with the duration of the quiescent phase .",
    "* decay phase : eventually the inner disc runs out of fuel ( because it is accreted onto the black hole faster than it is replenished ) and switches off , either cooling and jumping back to an accretion rate smaller than @xmath88 or emptying completely , leaving a new hole in the disc .",
    "the flux will therefore decay very quickly , bringing the source back to the quiescent phase .",
    "the temporal development of the le instability is compatible with that of the flare seen in ngc  3599 .",
    "the instability begins when the radiation pressure becomes comparable with the gas pressure .",
    "a heating wave is generated at the inner edge of the disc which propagates backwards through the disc at the sound speed ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "the heating increases the local viscosity , scale height of the disc and the local accretion rate @xcite . at this point",
    "the disc is no longer a thin shakura - sunyaev disc but still emits as a thermalised plasma .",
    "the time taken to fully heat the inner disc gives the rise time of the flare :    @xmath90    about a month for @xmath91 .    when the disc is emptied , as the hot radiating matter is accreted into the black hole more quickly than it is replenished @xcite , the flare decays ( decay phase ) .",
    "the time @xmath92 required to empty the inner disc ( or to let it go back to a tenuous plasma regime ) can not be shorter than the dynamical timescale , therefore it is given by :    @xmath93    a few hours for @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "we note here that our estimates are stringent lower limits , based on the assumption that the accretion rate is eddington limited .",
    "however , it is important to notice that , given the timescales discussed above , the rise time being longer than the decay time is a necessary condition for our interpretation to hold .",
    "our results show that the rise time ( @xmath96107 months ) is consistent with being longer than the decay time ( @xmath9736 months ) , therefore this constraint is not violated .",
    "as the inner disc is emptied and refilled , the flares should repeat on a timescale which is governed by the filling or viscous time at the truncation radius , i.e. decades for @xmath98 . a similar large flare in the sy 1.9 galaxy ic  3599 , which may have been produced by the same mechanism , repeated after 20 years @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations by @xcite show that the magnitude of the flare produced by an instability in the standard disc model is strongly influenced by the bh spin , while the timescale primarily depends on @xmath85 and viscosity .",
    "their simulations found a short flare with a duty cycle @xmath99% which would imply a long ( @xmath100 year ) quiescent phase for ngc  3599 . nevertheless , analytical work by @xcite and @xcite , which include the effects of a comptonisation zone , jet and non - standard viscosity , and produce longer flares compatible with those seen in grs  1915 + 105 , would allow a shorter repeat time .",
    "based on new data we have shown that it is difficult to reconcile the rise time of the soft x - ray flare seen in ngc 3599 with its previous classification as a classical , fast - rising , short plateau , tidal disruption event .",
    "it does , however , fit into the emerging scheme of a disruption which has led to a late , distant , circularisation where the rise is flatter and the peak lasts longer or alternatively to the tidal stripping of a red giant star .    if the factor 100 soft x - ray flare is interpreted as a change in the accretion from a persistent agn , we find that the rise time of @xmath2 years is too short to be explained purely by the bulk motion of disc material about a @xmath74 bh .",
    "the observed timescales are compatible with the lightman - eardley instability which boosts the thermal soft x - ray emission by heating the inner disk and raising its scale height .",
    "this mechanism predicts that flares will repeat on the viscous timescale of the truncation radius , i.e. every few decades .",
    "the behaviour of ngc 3599 would then be analogous to flares seen in certain galactic binary systems , but is too rapid to be equivalent to the state changes which are seen in those systems .",

    "<S> we present unpublished data from a tidal disruption candidate in ngc  3599 which show that the galaxy was already x - ray bright 18 months before the measurement which led to its classification . </S>",
    "<S> this removes the possibility that the flare was caused by a classical , fast - rising , short - peaked , tidal disruption event . </S>",
    "<S> recent relativistic simulations indicate that the majority of disruptions will actually take months or years to rise to a peak , which will then be maintained for longer than previously thought . </S>",
    "<S> ngc  3599 could be one of the first identified examples of such an event . </S>",
    "<S> the optical spectra of ngc  3599 indicate that it is a low - luminosity seyfert / liner with @xmath0 ergs s@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the flare may alternatively be explained by a thermal instability in the accretion disc , which propagates through the inner region at the sound speed , causing an increase of the disc scale height and local accretion rate . </S>",
    "<S> this can explain the @xmath2 years rise time of the flare . </S>",
    "<S> if this mechanism is correct then the flare may repeat on a timescale of several decades as the inner disc is emptied and refilled .    </S>",
