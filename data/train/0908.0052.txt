    "relativistic heavy ion collisions have been considered as a way to create the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , the phase of de - confined quarks and gluons . the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory was constructed to create and study the qgp .",
    "one of the most powerful probes for investigating the characteristics of the qgp is measuring the azimuthal anisotropy of the charged particles produced by the collisions .",
    "the strength of the elliptic anisotropy ( @xmath1 ) reflects the initial geometrical anisotropy , which creates pressure gradients in the collision area .",
    "this pressure gradient transfers a spatial anisotropy into a momentum anisotropy since particles are pushed harder in the direction of the larger gradients .",
    "thus , the measured @xmath1 reflects the dynamical properties of the dense matter produced in the collisions .",
    "one of the most remarkable findings at rhic is that the strength of @xmath4 can be described well by hydro - dynamical models in the low transverse momentum region ( @xmath5 1 gev/@xmath6 )  @xcite . in the intermediate transverse momentum region ( 1 @xmath5 4 gev/@xmath6 ) , @xmath4 is consistent with quark number ( @xmath7 ) and @xmath8 ( = @xmath9 - @xmath10 ) scaling , and the result supports a quark - recombination model @xcite . for a more comprehensive understanding of @xmath4 ,",
    "we have carried out systematic measurements of @xmath4 , by measuring @xmath4 for identified charged hadrons in au+au and cu+cu collisions at @xmath3  =  200 and 62.4 gev , and studied the dependence on collision energy , species and centrality .",
    "we expect that the @xmath4 is determined not only by the initial ellipticity , but is also influenced by a finite evolution time which can be related to the collision volume .",
    "the left panel in figure  [ v2_npart_4systems ] shows @xmath4 vs. @xmath2 for two collision systems and two collision energies .",
    "the @xmath4 agrees well at @xmath3 = 200 and 62.4 gev , but there is a clear difference between the cu+cu and au+au results . since au+au and cu+cu collisions have different initial geometrical eccentricities at the same @xmath2 , applying the eccentricity ( @xmath11 ) scaling shows that the data follows a universal curve as shown in the middle panel in figure  [ v2_npart_4systems ] . here",
    ", we use the participant eccentricity , calculated with a long and short axis determined by the distribution of participants at each collision , using a monte - carlo simulation based on a glauber model and including effects from participant fluctuations .",
    "the details of the participant eccentricity are described in @xcite .",
    "one can see that @xmath1/@xmath11 is not a constant and it depends on @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , @xmath1 can be normalized by @xmath11 at the same @xmath2 , but @xmath11 is not enough to determine @xmath1 .",
    "we newly found that @xmath1/@xmath11 is proportional to @xmath12 , and as shown in the right panel in figure  [ v2_npart_4systems ] @xmath1/(@xmath13 ) is independent of the collision system except for small @xmath2 in cu+cu at @xmath3 = 62.4 gev .",
    "this exception indicates this might be a region where the matter has not reached sufficient thermalization , although the errors are too large to discuss the difference .",
    "a scan of collision energies would be important to further study this effect .",
    "figure  [ v2_npart_4systems ] is for @xmath0 = 0.2 - 1.0 gev/@xmath6 .",
    "the results for @xmath0 = 1.0 - 2.0 and 2.0 - 4.0 gev/@xmath6 have the same tendency as well .     as a function of @xmath2 for four collision systems .",
    "left panel shows @xmath1 vs. @xmath2 , middle panel is @xmath1/@xmath11 vs. @xmath2 and right panel is @xmath1/(@xmath13 ) vs. @xmath2 .",
    "closed symbols indicate the results of @xmath3 = 200 gev , open symbols are for @xmath3 = 62.4 gev .",
    "circles indicate au+au collisions and squares cu+cu .",
    "the statistical and systematic errors are included in the bars . ]",
    "similar to the result in au+au at @xmath3 = 200 gev , @xmath1 in au+au at @xmath3 = 62.4 gev and in cu+cu at @xmath3 = 200 gev are mostly consistent with @xmath14 + @xmath8 scaling for centralities 0 - 50% .",
    "in addition to the fact that @xmath15 does not depend on collision energy at rhic energies , @xmath1 normalized by quark number + @xmath8 , eccentricity , and @xmath12 scaling follows a universal curve as shown in figure  [ v2_universal_45 ] .",
    "this figure includes the 45 curves for @xmath16/k / p in au+au at @xmath3  =  200 gev , in au+au at @xmath3 = 62.4 gev and in cu+cu at @xmath3  =  200 gev for the five centrality bins from 0 - 50% in 10% steps .",

    "the two parameters , the radial velocity ( @xmath19 ) and the freeze - out temperature ( @xmath20 ) , are extracted from the invariant cross section data according to the following equation :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 and @xmath23 represent modified bessel functions with @xmath24 the transverse boost @xmath25 = @xmath26 , @xmath27 = @xmath28 , and @xmath9 = @xmath29 .",

    "when scaled by eccentricity , @xmath31/@xmath11 agrees between au+au and cu+cu and it is flat at @xmath2 @xmath37 40 as shown in figure  [ fig : betat2_ov_epspart_vs_npart ] .",
    "since @xmath4 is proportional to @xmath31 in this model , @xmath4 should be scaled by participant eccentricity . however , as shown in figure  [ v2_npart_4systems ] , this is not what is seen in the measured @xmath4  results .",
