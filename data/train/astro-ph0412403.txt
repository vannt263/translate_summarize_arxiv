    "a fundamental issue in the study of star formation is understanding the physical structure of molecular gas clouds from which stars are formed . despite a wealth of observational data for the milky way ( c.f .",
    "fuller & myers 1992 ; goodman et al .",
    "1998 ) , the nature of the equation of state ( eos ) remains a major theoretical problem in understanding the stabillity and collapse of molecular clouds .",
    "the stiffness of the eos can be largely responsible for the resulting density probability function of interstellar gas in the turbulent ism .",
    "in particular , the value of the polytropic index @xmath2 strongly influences the mass distribution of density condensations as well as the amount of clump fragmentation ( vzquez - semadeni et al .",
    "1996 ; li et al .",
    "2003 ) . in spaans & silk ( 2000 ) the properties of a polytropic eos were investigated and it was found that the stiffness of the eos depends strongly on the ambient metallicity .",
    "recent observations of metal - deficient stars such as he 0107 - 5240 ( christlieb et al .",
    "2004 ) and cs 29498 - 043 ( aoki et al.2004 ) indicate that formation of ( low - mass ) stars is possible in very low metallity gas clouds .",
    "the formation of stars in low - metallicity environments ( abel , bryan & norman , 2002 ) is important for the reionization of the universe and the early enrichment of the interstellar and intergalactic medium ( hirashita & ferrara 2002 ) .",
    "even though more ( but not many more ) stars are known with very low fe abundances ( e.g. , cs 22949 - 037 ; aoki et al .",
    "2004 ) , we concentrate on the two stars mentioned above since they appear to reflect the wide range in c , n , o and @xmath11 element abundance patterns for fe - deficient stars .",
    "it is not generally known what influence the environment has on the shape of the imf .",
    "hst / wfpc2 observations of the lmc by gouliermis , brander & henning ( 2004 ) indicate that local conditions seem to favor the formation of higher mass stars ( top - heavy imf ) in associations , and not in the background field .",
    "however , meyer et al .",
    "( 2004 , and references therein ) find that the imf is not a strong function of environment or initial conditions . in any case , the numerical simulations of li et al .",
    "( 2003 , and references therein ) indicate that the value of the polytropic index strongly influences the spectrum of density condensations that is formed under the influence of gravity and turbulent driving . in particular , fragmentation is enhanced or inhibited when @xmath2 is smaller ( 0.7 ) or larger ( 1.1 ) than unity . in this context , we present computations of the polytropic eos of primordial ( low - metallicity ) gas clouds at high redshifts .",
    "we also comment on interstellar regions that have super - solar metallicities and are exposed to a warm ( dusty ) infrared background ( e.g. , starbursts ) .",
    "we assume that the observed abundances of species like c , o , si and fe are representative of the gas from which the currently observed metal - deficient stars formed .",
    "we further employ a polytropic eos , @xmath12 , where @xmath2 is the polytropic index and @xmath13 the mass density .",
    "we adopt a perfect gas equation of state , @xmath14 for the gas temperature @xmath15 , to write @xmath2 as @xmath16 this last step is justified ( scalo & biswas 2002 ; vzquez - semadeni , passot & pouquet , 1996 ) as long as the heating and cooling terms in the fluid energy equation can adjust to balance each other on a time - scale shorter than the time - scale of the gas dynamics ( i.e. , thermal equilibrium ) .",
    "it should be noted that because @xmath2 depends on the ( logarithmic ) derivative of the temperature with respect to density , it implicitly depends on radiative transfer effects and changes in chemical composition through derivatives of the heating and cooling functions ( spaans & silk 2000 ) .",
    "the model described in spaans & silk ( 2000 ) is used in this work and the interested reader is referred to that paper for a detailed description of the various heating and cooling terms that influence the polytropic index .",
    "the ( updated ) two - dimensional numerical radiative transfer code of spaans ( 1996 ) with the detailed chemical treatment of spaans & van dishoeck ( 1997 ) , and its extensions to lower metallicities by norman & spaans ( 1997 ) and spaans & norman ( 1997 ) is used in this work . with the work of scalo ( 1998 ) and le bourlot et al .",
    "( 1999 ) it is possible to extend the spaans & silk ( 2000 ) model to metallicities much smaller than 1% of solar , where h@xmath4 and hd completely dominate the cooling of the gas .",
    "the main features of the model are summarized below .",
    "we consider self - gravitating _ spherical _ clouds and therefore we adopt a singular isothermal sphere ( neufeld , lepp & melnick 1995 ) , for which the total hydrogen number density @xmath17 scales with column density @xmath18 per unit of velocity as @xmath19 we include number densities , @xmath20 , upto @xmath21 @xmath8 and metallicities as low as @xmath22 and 0 in solar units . furthermore ,",
    "dust temperatures between 10 and 100 k can be treated and the latest chemical reaction rates have been used in the computations ( le teuff , millar & markwick , 2000 ) .",
    "care has been taken to check the convergence of the chemical equilibrium calculations for o / c ratios that significantly differ from solar .",
    "in general , the thermal and chemical balance was solved iteratively with a convergence criterion of 0.1% for the chemical abundances and level populations .",
    "the computed grid is accurate enough to do linear interpolations between the log of any two adjacent values .",
    "extrapolation of the values of @xmath2 to densities lower than @xmath23 @xmath8 ( say to @xmath24 @xmath8 ) is reliable because the slopes are modest .",
    "note that softening of the eos due to gas cooling on cold dust can be important and flips over to gas heating when the dust is warm .",
    "we have used a cosmic ray heating rate for the low - metallicity models that is given by a cosmic ray ionization rate of @xmath25 , with @xmath26 s@xmath27 .",
    "this means that cosmic ray heating is provided by a background star formation rate of the order of @xmath28 .",
    "however , the zero metallicity polytropic index is only weakly dependent on temperature between 100 and 2000 k so that the actual value of the cosmic ray heating rate , as long as it is proportional to density , does not matter much for the low - metallicity case ( scalo & biswas 2002 ) . for starburst environments , we assume a cosmic ray ionization rate of @xmath29 .",
    "solar relative abundances are assumed ( asplund et al . , 2004 ; jenkins 2004 ) .",
    "the latter condition is replaced by the observed abundance pattern of metal - deficient stars for some of the primordial gas cloud models .",
    "we further adopt a mrn grain size distribution ( mathis , rumpl & nordsieck 1977 ) and assume that the dust abundance scales with the carbon abundance .",
    "the velocity dispersion of microscopic turbulence is @xmath30 km / s in the quiescent primordial gas , to which the purely thermal contribution is added ( in the square ) while the iterations on the thermal and chemical balance are performed .",
    "however , for the starburst model @xmath31 km / s is adopted to take the larger input of kinetic energy ( e.g. , through supernovae ) into account .    no freeze - out of molecules is assumed .",
    "the latter assumption is justified because our dust is generally warmer than 20 k. the total extinction through the starburst region containing the model cloud is 100 mag ( spaans & silk 2000 ) .",
    "the results of le bourlot et al .",
    "( 1999 ) are used for the collisional excitation of h@xmath4 by h , he and h@xmath4 , where non - local thermodynamic equilibrium level populations and quantum - mechanical cross sections are computed . for hd cooling , the results of flower et al .",
    "( 1999 ) are used . both h@xmath4 and hd line emission",
    "are optically thin . for completeness",
    "we have also included h@xmath4 formation heating with equal contributions from the binding energy ( 4.93 ev ) to translational , rotational and ( statistically distributed ) vibrational degrees of freedom ( sternberg & dalgarno 1989 ; meijerink & spaans 2004 ) .",
    "the computed values of @xmath2 depend sensitively on a number of effects : 1 ) line trapping , 2 ) metallicity , 3 ) h@xmath4o heating and cooling , 4 ) microturbulence versus a large velocity gradient ( lvg ) velocity field .",
    "in particular , 4 ) is important in the context of collapsing molecular cloud cores .",
    "note that a lvg approximation suppresses line trapping somewhat , and yields a relatively softer equation of state ( see spaans & silk 2000 ) .",
    "also , h@xmath4o heating , where absorption of infrared photons and collisional de - excitation causes heating ( takahashi , hollenbach & silk 1983 ) , plays a smaller role for a lvg model unless @xmath32 mag .",
    "we assume a microturbulent velocity field for all simulations . for optically thin ( e.g. , low - metallicity ) line emission the velocity field plays no role .",
    "we ignore time - dependent effects ( bromm & loeb 2003 ) .",
    "uv illumination from the outside , not included here , will create a warm pdr region where the cooling is dominated by [ cii ] and [ oi ] fine - structure emission and the polytropic index varies between 0.5 - 1.0 for c@xmath33 and between 0.6 - 1.2 for o - dominated emission .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in order to assess the impact of elemental abundances that strongly deviate from solar , a grid was run with the parameters listed in table 1 . the figure number and color coding of each model are listed .",
    "the primordial model 1 is used as a baseline to assess the impact of c , o and dust on the polytropic eos .",
    "redshifts of 10 and 20 are considered for the high redshift universe and the temperature of the dust , if any is present , is taken equal to that of the cmb .",
    "overall , the grid covers the two fe - deficient stars , through models a , b1 and b2 , and a range in carbon that limits , through model 13 , to the zero - metallicity primordial cooling curve .",
    "furthermore , various oxygen models are explored to show the large impact that o has on the eos , i.e. , models 10 - 12 for no o and models 2 - 9 for solar and super - solar o / c ratios .",
    "the latter are relevant because observations of cs 29498 - 043 ( aoki et al .",
    "2004 ) indicate that the oxygen over carbon ratio can also be enhanced relative to the solar ratio .",
    "finally , model 14 is a starburst environment where o / c is solar , but the overall metallicity is super - solar by a factor of two .",
    "it is straightforward to identify a number of trends in the models .",
    "we first note that in all models with a non - zero oxygen abundance , part of the gas cooling is provided by the [ oi ] 63 um line .",
    "this line can go into absorption against the warm cmb below a gas kinetic temperature of @xmath34 k. collisional de - excitation of excited [ oi ] then leads to heating and a change in the polytropic index with the cmb temperature , e.g. , in models 2 - 5 , even when no dust is present .",
    "the same effect occurs for absorption of the cmb by water , i.e. , h@xmath4o collisional de - excitation heating . from figures 1 - 4",
    "one sees further that : i ) carbon alone , even at 3% of solar , is not able to significantly stiffen ( @xmath35 ) the eos ( figure 3 ) .",
    "ii ) oxygen needs to be present at no less than the 1% of solar level to boost the opacity in the co and h@xmath4o lines at densities around @xmath36 @xmath8 , see figure 1 , and yield values of @xmath2 larger than unity .",
    "note in this that the total abundance of oxygen ( rather than carbon ) sets a limit to the maximum amount of gas phase co when [ o / h]@xmath37[c / h ] .",
    "iii ) the model parental cloud of he 0107 - 5240 is characterized by a soft eos , while that of cs 29498 - 043 has a stiff eos , see figure 4 .",
    "iv ) an overabundance ( relative to solar ) of oxygen leads to a significantly stiffer eos ( figure 2 ) , even when the overall metallicity is only of the order of 3% of solar .",
    "that is , if the o / c ratio is enhanced by a factor of three compared to its solar value , then the eos stiffens to values of @xmath2 in the 1.2 range at around @xmath38 @xmath8 .",
    "v ) this effect is further enhanced ( also figure 2 ) when the temperature of the dust is high , due to the cmb at @xmath39 , and allows h@xmath4o ( collisional de - excitation ) heating to dominate the thermal budget and cause the gas heating to attain a @xmath40 density dependence .",
    "vi ) at densities around @xmath41 @xmath8 , the polytropic index dips below unity if the dust temperature , @xmath42 , is lower than the gas temperature .",
    "this results in @xmath9 for models with dust at @xmath43 .",
    "if the dust grains are warm , then dust - grain heating causes the eos to stiffen further and @xmath44 beyond the h@xmath4o opacity peak .",
    "recall in this case that gas - dust heating / cooling scales as @xmath45 .",
    "vii ) the starburst ( figure 4 ) has the stiffest eos because of its high absolute metallicity and warm ( @xmath46 k ) dust .",
    "viii ) the temperature of the dust , if present , plays an important regulating role , see figure 2 .",
    "in commenting on our results , we wish to distinguish slightly enriched , @xmath47 , primordial gas that leads to fe - deficient stars ( models 2 - 12 , a , b1 and b2 ) from almost zero metallicity , @xmath48 , primordial gas associated with pop iii star - forming regions ( models 1 and 13 ) .",
    "as figures 1 - 4 show , these two metallicity regimes exhibit quite different behaviors as far as the polytropic index is concerned .    we point out that all the models presented in this work are computed for a microturbulent velocity field with @xmath30 ( or 3 for the starburst model 14 ) km / s and a thermal velocity contribution that is determined by the thermal and chemical balance of the medium .",
    "however , if large velocity gradients are present then optical depth effects , particularly line trapping in h@xmath4o and co transitions , are more modest and @xmath2 decreases ( spaans & silk 2000 ) .    also , adiabatic ( compressional ) heating has a density dependence of @xmath49 , in between cosmic ray ionization , @xmath50 , and gas - dust or h@xmath4o , @xmath51 , collisional heating .",
    "compressional work is not relevant to model clouds that can be described by singular isothermal spheres ; however , in a collapsing medium it must play a role .",
    "our heating terms bracket adiabatic heating when dust is present and/or @xmath52 .",
    "for @xmath53 , we expect @xmath2 to attain a slightly larger asymptotic value of @xmath54 for @xmath55 @xmath8 ( scalo & biswas 2002 ; schneider et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "at smaller densities the higher resulting temperatures , @xmath56 k ( abel , bryan & norman , 2000 ) , prevent @xmath2 from increasing significantly under the @xmath57 term because excited atomic ( e.g. , o , si ) and molecular ( e.g. , co , h@xmath4o ) states with progressively higher critical densities become accessible , already at a metallicity of @xmath58 . these higher critical densities",
    "ensure that the sub - thermal @xmath40 density dependence is maintained for larger gas densities .      in spaans & silk ( 2000 )",
    ", it is argued that a defining criterion for low- or high - mass star formation to prevail , i.e. , whether fragmentation can proceed to small enough mass scales to cause a flattening in the imf below about 0.3 @xmath59 ( scalo 1998 ) , is whether the eos has a polytropic index @xmath60 that is smaller or larger than about unity , respectively . above this canonical value of @xmath61 , with @xmath62 the number of dimensions in which cloud contraction occurs , _ sheets _ ( @xmath63 ) are able to stop fragmentation and start gravitational contraction because the jeans mass does not decrease any further . in the present discussion ,",
    "the thermal jeans mass , @xmath64 , as well as its generalisations to turbulent and magnetic media , plays a secondary role .",
    "if the elemental abundance pattern that is observed for he 0107 - 5240 is typical for the parental cloud in which this star formed , then low - mass star formation is the dominating mode .",
    "this is consistent with the modest , @xmath65 , mass of he 0107 - 5240 .",
    "furthermore , for a solar o / c ratio , a carbon abundance of less than 3% of solar still results in an eos where @xmath2 does not become significantly larger than unity even for warm dust grains .",
    "this would imply that the imf would not be top - heavy at high redshift once metal enrichment sets in .",
    "such an imf would not be desirable for scenarios where the bulk of the reionization is caused by stars .",
    "we also checked that the abundance pattern observed in he 0107 - 5240 provides sufficient levels of carbon to ensure that the cooling time is less than the free - fall time ( bromm & loeb 2003 ) .",
    "however , if the abundance pattern of cs 29498 - 043 is typical , then then we would expect that oxygen is relatively overabundant and that the the eos is stiff , particularly when the ambient dust is warm .",
    "this would cause a shallow imf at high redshift and a continuation of the formation of high - mass stars .",
    "such an imf would yield a larger number of ionizing photons per unit of mass .    in this context",
    ", it should be mentioned that theoretical models for supernova yields of very massive , @xmath66 , primordial stars are capable of reproducing the c and o abundances , but at the expense of the r- and s - process elements ( umeda & nomoto 2003 )",
    ". an alternative would be that massive stars with @xmath67 , i.e. , stars that do not go supernova , evolve rapidly enough to provide he - burning elements without the usual supernova dust production ( pel , private communication ) .",
    "the latter scenario is interesting in that one would have a stiff eos around @xmath7 @xmath8 , but without the ability of cool silicate dust at @xmath68 to soften @xmath2 around @xmath10 @xmath8 .",
    "evidence is mounting that many carbon - enriched metal deficient stars are in binaries , where they may have picked up enriched ejecta of an intermediate - mass companion ( c.f .",
    "lucatello et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "the observed stellar abundance pattern is then still indicative of the elemental interstellar gas composition at early times .      in the limit of very low metallicity , @xmath69 or less , the work of schneider et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2003 ) and bromm et al .",
    "( 2001 ) suggests that a metallicity of @xmath70 at a density of @xmath71 @xmath8 leads to efficient cooling and causes a softening of the eos that gives rise to fragmentation and the formation of clumps with masses @xmath72 .",
    "we would like to stress that the polytropic index @xmath2 is already less than unity at much smaller , @xmath73 @xmath8 , densities ( scalo & biswas 2002 ) as shown by models 1 and 13 . while in the density regime around @xmath74 @xmath8 , individual clumps are no longer able to separate and accretion / coagulation dominates , at low densities the higher fragment mass ( @xmath75 ) may still lead to low - mass fragmentation ( e.g. , through disk formation ) because the medium is very unstable to ( turbulent ) compression when @xmath76 ( li et al .",
    "2003 ) . in this case",
    ", a metallicity of around @xmath77 would still retain a soft eos to below @xmath78 at densities below @xmath79 @xmath8 .",
    "] , while it would also strongly lower the ambient cloud temperature ( bromm & loeb 2003 ) and reduce the thermal jeans mass ( @xmath80 ) that pertains to a cloud prior to fragmentation . three - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations indicate that it is the initial jeans mass that controls , in part , the subsequent fragmentation ( vzquez - semadeni et al . , 1996 ) . following the discussion in spaans & silk ( 2000 ) on the role of the jeans mass",
    ", we would argue that @xmath2 , already at low densities , determines the shape of the imf , while the instantaneous value of the jeans mass during fragmentation plays a lesser role .",
    "a similar scenario may apply to starburst galaxies .",
    "the super - solar abundances ( barthel 2004 ) , high gas temperatures and high densities in those regions imply large amounts of h@xmath4o .",
    "also , the dust ( set here at 75 k ) is warm due to the intense ultraviolet radiation field , which facilitates a ) h@xmath4o heating around @xmath79 @xmath8 and b ) gas - dust heating around @xmath81 @xmath8 .",
    "note that h@xmath4o collisional de - excitation dominates the heating for super - solar oxygen abundances .",
    "in fact , an eos as stiff as in spaans & silk ( 2000 ) for dust of 100 k is obtained in this work .",
    "the resulting imf , as also argued in spaans & silk ( 2000 ) for solar abundances , would be top - heavy and the overabundance of uv - luminous massive stars would continue the starburst cycle through radiative feedback .",
    "it is interesting to note that the starburst model ( 14 ) attains a value of @xmath82 at @xmath83 @xmath8 .",
    "this is somewhat larger than the canonical value of @xmath84 for _ spherical _ ( @xmath85 ) clouds .",
    "there are a number of issues that should be addressed in the future : i ) observations of water lines with the hifi instrument on herschel should be performed to determine the h@xmath4o level populations and substantiate our claim of a polytropic index @xmath86 in starburst galaxies .",
    "ii ) numerical simulations with density and metallicity - dependent values of @xmath2 , i.e. , a pointwise polytropic eos , should be performed for collapsing gas clouds to assess the relative impacts of magnetic fields , turbulence and the eos on gravitational collapse and the shape of the imf ( c.f .",
