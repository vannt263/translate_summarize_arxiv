    "type ib supernovae ( sne ib ) are one of subtypes of core - collapse supernovae ( cc - sne ) , whose early spectra are characterized by strong helium features around maximum .",
    "sne ib belong to a larger group of ` stripped - envelope ' cc - sne @xcite , together with sne ic ( sne without hydrogen nor helium ) and sne iib ( showing hydrogen only during early phase ) .",
    "it is commonly accepted that a progenitor star of a stripped - envelope cc - sn has lost its hydrogen envelope via either a strong stellar wind in a wolf - rayet ( wr ) phase or an interaction with a binary companion .",

    "details of the connection are still under debate .    in recent years",
    ", many detailed observations have been performed for sne ib , and a large diversity has been recognized , e.g. , a normal sn ib sn 1990i , a mildly energetic sn 2008d @xcite , transitional sne ib / iib sn 2008ax @xcite , 1999dn @xcite , and 2011ei @xcite , a rapidly - evolving faint sn 2007y @xcite , faint ca - rich sne 2005e @xcite and 2005cz @xcite , a slowly - evolving sn 2009jf @xcite , an intermediate sample between sne ib and ic sn 1999ex @xcite , and a very peculiar sn 2005bf @xcite . in this letter , we report optical photometry and spectroscopy of sn ib 2012au in the early phase and discuss the results based on the observations . we show that sn 2012au has observational properties similar to grb - associated energetic sne ic rather than normal sne ib / c .",
    "sn 2012au was discovered by catalina real - time transient survey snhunt project on 2012 mar 14 ut @xcite in ngc 4790 , and subsequently classified as sn ib @xcite .",
    "we carried out photometric ( 54 nights ) and spectroscopic ( 19 nights ) observations of sn 2012au from 2012 mar 15 through aug 19 with howpol @xcite attached to 1.5 m kanata telescope at higashi - hiroshima observatory .",
    "we used @xmath15 and @xmath16 filters for the photometric observation .",

    "landolt standard fields were used for photometric calibration of several nearby comparison stars . for spectroscopy , we calibarated flux scale using spectrophotometric standard star hr 4963 obtained in the same nights .",
    "we used the sky emission lines simultaneously recorded on the sn spectra for wavelength calibration , and then achieved a wavelength error of @xmath17  over wavelength range 45009200  with the resolution of @xmath18 .",
    "it is noted that the bright nucleus of the host galaxy exists only @xmath19 east from this sn and it may contaminate our photometry in the latest phase",
    ". however , this effect would be negligible in our discussion .",
    "in addition to the spectra of sn 2012au , we present our unpublished spectra of sn 2009jf ( two epochs ) obtained with glows installed to the 1.5 m telescope at gunma astronomical observatory .",
    "we first correct galactic extinction of @xmath20 mag @xcite . for the extinction within the host galaxy , we place a limit as @xmath21 mag from the upper - limit of the equivalent width of d absorption line @xcite in the averaged spectra .",

    "the light curves ( lcs ) and color curves are shown in figure 1 .",

    "another systematic study suggests that @xmath30 mag for sne ib ( and @xmath31 mag and @xmath32 mag for sne ic and sne ic - bl , respectively ; * ? ? ?",
    "sn 2012au belongs to a very luminous group among sne ib .",
    "the post maximum decline within 15 d is estimated to be @xmath33 mag , which locates near the center of the cluster of drout et al.s samples , which ranges from @xmath90.4 to @xmath90.8 mag .",
    "after @xmath34 d , the sn showed a slow decline with the rate @xmath35 mag d@xmath6 ( average in 34111 d ) in @xmath2 band .    in the upper panel of figure 2",
    ", we show a comparison of @xmath2-band lc with other cc - sne , sn 2008ax ( ib / iib ) , sn 2009jf ( ib ) , sn 1998bw ( ic - bl ) and sn 1993j ( iib ) and also with the loss averages . around maximum ,",
    "the lc of sn 2012au is very similar to those of sn 1998bw and the loss average , showing a slightly slower evolution than lcs of sne 2008ax and sn 1993j . on the other hand , in the tail of lc ( @xmath36 d ) , sn 2012au shows slower evolution than these sne except for the slowly - evolving sn ib 2009jf .",
    "these facts suggest that the trapping efficiencies of optical and @xmath37-ray photons within the ejecta are larger than the typical .",
    "the color evolution is shown in the lower panel of figure 1 .",
    "it becomes progressively redder until @xmath920 d and then its slopes becomes rather flat , which is similar to those seen in other sne ib / c .",
    "@xcite suggested that the intrinsic @xmath38 colors fall in a relatively narrow range @xmath39 mag around 10 d. in case of sn 2012au , @xmath40 mag at 10 d , which is slightly redder than the mean value .",
    "we show the spectral evolution from @xmath0 d to @xmath41 d in figure 3 . around maximum , the absorption line of @xmath4 5876 is conspicuous as in other sne ib .",
    "we can see other lines ( @xmath42 6678 , 7065 ) , @xmath4 5169 and ir triplet .",
    "after @xmath43 d , nebular emission lines , [ ] @xmath42 6300,6364 and [ ] @xmath42 7291,7323 , appear .",
    "a comparison of the spectra around maximum and @xmath44 d are shown in the bottom panels of figure 3 .",
    "it is clear that the blueshift of and other lines in sn 2012au is larger than other sne , which is discussed in  4.2 .",
    "from our @xmath45 photometry , we calculated quasi - bolometric luminosity , assuming that the @xmath45 bands occupy about 60% of the bolometric one around the peak @xcite .",
    "because of this simple assumption , this bolometric luminosity may well have a large systematic error ( @xmath46% ) .",
    "the derived quasi - bolometric lc is shown in the bottom panel of figure 2 .",
    "it reaches @xmath47 erg s@xmath6 at maximum .",
    "this is clearly larger than those of sn 2009jf ( @xmath48 erg s@xmath6 ; * ? ? ?",

    "* see below ) .",
    "a general interpretation of the radiation source of sne ib / c around maximum is that the energy generated by the decays of @xmath8ni and @xmath8co emerges out of the photosphere as optical radiation @xcite .",
    "therefore , the @xmath8ni mass , @xmath51 , can be derived from the peak bolometric luminosity @xmath52 and the rising time @xmath53 as @xmath54 with @xmath55 d @xcite and @xmath56 erg s@xmath6 , we obtain @xmath57 m@xmath10 .",
    "this @xmath8ni mass is larger than that in other sne ib ( e.g. , 0.070.15 m@xmath10 in sn 2008ax and 0.140.20 m@xmath10 in sn 2009jf ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "next , we try to constrain the @xmath8ni mass from the tail component of the quasi - bolometric lc ( @xmath58@xmath59 d ) using a simple one - zone model @xcite as shown in figure 2 . at first",
    ", with a simplified assumption that @xmath37-rays are fully trapped and deposit their energy in the ejecta , this model gives @xmath8ni masses of 0.30 m@xmath10 for the peak bolometric luminosity ( as is equivalent to equation 1 ) . for a more realistic treatment where the @xmath37-rays can only be partly absorbed ,",
    "we need to provide the optical depth to @xmath37-ray within the ejecta , @xmath60 . in this case",
    "the bolometric luminosity in the later phase ( @xmath61 d ) can be written asco decay contribution here for simplicity .",

    "@xmath62\\ ] ] and @xmath63 where @xmath64 is time after the explosion in day ( @xmath65 ) , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are energy deposits by @xmath37-ray and positrons , respectively , and @xmath68 is the ejecta mass in solar mass unit . by changing these parameters",
    ", however , it turns out that we are unable to reproduce the peak and tail simultaneously with a single component ( for example , the case of @xmath51 = 0.26 m@xmath10 and @xmath69 = 4 $ ] is shown in figure 2 ) .",
    "the tail luminosity requires a small value of @xmath60 , while tail slope requires a large value of @xmath60 instead .",
    "therefore , we introduce a two - component model similar to @xcite , consisting of an inner region having large optical thickness @xmath70 and an outer region having small @xmath71 . the luminosity is then expressed as @xmath72 + m_{\\rm out}(^{56}{\\rm ni } ) e^{(-t_d/113 \\rm{d } ) } \\big [   \\epsilon_{\\gamma}(1-e^{-\\tau_{\\rm out}})+\\epsilon_{e^{+ } } \\big ] \\mbox{,}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath73_{\\rm in } ~t_{d}^{-2 }   \\mbox { , and}\\\\   \\tau_{\\rm out } & = & 1000 \\times \\big [ \\frac{(m_{\\rm ej}/m_{\\odot})^2}{e_{51 } } \\big]_{\\rm out } ~t_{d}^{-2 } \\mbox{.}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the observation is reproduced reasonably well using this model with @xmath74 , + @xmath69_{\\rm in } = 20 $ ] , @xmath75 , and @xmath69_{\\rm out } = 2 $ ] ( the bottome panel of figure 2 ) .",
    "this result favors that a dense core exists in their inner region .",
    "it is interesting that a similar density contrast has also been derived for the luminous sn ic - bl 1998bw which possibly produced a jet - like , asymmetric ejection @xcite ; @xmath76 , @xmath69_{\\rm in } = 26 $ ] , @xmath77 , and @xmath69_{\\rm out } = 1 $ ] .",
    "the fraction of @xmath8ni in the high velocity component is smaller in sn 2012au , which might suggest either a difference in details of the explosion or a different viewing direction ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .    in this two - component model",
    ", the sum of the @xmath8ni mass is 0.26 m@xmath10 . the difference from 0.30",
    "m@xmath10 derived from the peak luminosity suggests that the ratio of peak bolometric to radioactive luminosities , @xmath78 , is not unity , but @xmath79 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the @xmath8ni mass of 0.26 m@xmath10 is likely a better estimation .",
    "however , to provide a better comparison to other sne ( where @xmath80 1 is typically assumed ) , we adopt 0.30 m@xmath10 throughout this letter .",
    "we derived the line velocities of @xmath4 5876 , ir triplet ( assumed to the absorption peak at 8571   ) and @xmath4 5169 by fitting a quadratic - function to each absorption feature ( figure 4 ) .",
    "around maximum , the he velocity of sn 2012au is @xmath81 km s@xmath6 , which is significantly larger than those of the sne ib samples in @xcite that clustered around @xmath82 km s@xmath6 .",
    "after 30 d , the he velocities in most sne ib decrease and tend to converge at @xmath83@xmath84 km s@xmath6 ( fig . 4 ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on the other hand , sn 2012au exhibits large he velocity , @xmath85 km s@xmath6 even at @xmath86 d. we also derived the line velocities at @xmath46678 and @xmath47065 up to @xmath87 d and confirmed that their velocities are consistent with that of @xmath45876 within @xmath88 km s@xmath6 , suggesting that the contamination by d to @xmath45876 is negligible during the period .",
    "the line velocities of ir triplet and @xmath4 5169 are also as large as that of at @xmath0 d ( fig .",
    "4 ) . the fe velocity shows a steep decrease from @xmath89 km s@xmath6 around maximum to an asymptotic value of @xmath90 km s@xmath6 after @xmath86 d. this trend is also seen in other sne ib , while the velocity in other sne ib is lower than @xmath91 km s@xmath6 at maximum @xcite .",
    "this may suggest that the distribution of iron is rather widespread , up to the outermost region , in the ejecta .",
    "we show the equivalent width ( ew ) of @xmath45876 absorption line in figure 4 .",
    "it is about 80   at @xmath0 d , which is larger than that of sn 2008d at similar phase .",
    "this might be related with the he enevelope mass and/or the distribution of @xmath8ni .",
    "we estimate the ejetcta mass , @xmath92 , and kinetic energy , @xmath93 , using scaling relations .",
    "the relevant basic equations are @xmath94 where @xmath95 is absorption coefficient for optical photons , and @xmath96 is a typical expansion velocity @xcite .",
    "we apply this relation to the case of sn 2012au using the parameters derived for well - studied sn 2008d @xcite as the scaling template .",
    "we derive the parameters of sn 2012au as @xmath97@xmath12 m@xmath10 and @xmath98@xmath14 erg , where we adopt the line velocities around maximum as the expansion velocities d , the parameters show only a small fractional changes as @xmath97@xmath12 m@xmath10 and @xmath99@xmath100 erg . ] .    in figure 5 ,",
    "we plot the peak @xmath2-band absolute magnitude @xmath101 vs. the @xmath45876 line velocity @xmath102 around maximum ( left panel ) and",
    "the @xmath8ni mass vs. the kinetic energy ( right panel ) in sn 2012au with those of other sne ib ( and also sne ic in the right panel ) for comparison .",
    "we see weak positive correlations both in @xmath103 and @xmath104 except for very peculiar sn 2005bf . to our knowledge",
    ", the former correlation has not been pointed out so far ; the data point of sn ib 2012au makes it much clearer .",
    "also in the right panel , the point of sn 2012au is apart from the average of sne ib and ic , and rather near of the average of grb - associated sne .",
    "these results may indicate that sn 2012au have observational properties similar to hypernova .",
    "we presented early phase optical photometric and spectroscopic observations of sn 2012au and discussed that ( i ) sn 2012au is a very luminous sn ib whose peak quasi - bolometric luminosity reached @xmath105 erg  s@xmath6 , and that ( ii ) this sn shows large velocity from maximum through @xmath106 d , and ( iii ) there is a possible positive correlation between @xmath102 and @xmath101 among sne ib .",
    "we derived constraints on the explosion parameters for sn 2012au as follows : @xmath97@xmath12 m@xmath10 and @xmath98@xmath14 erg . while this may contain a large error , the ejecta mass points to the main - sequence mass of @xmath107@xmath108 ( see * ? ? ? * ) . together with the large explosion energy and the large @xmath8ni mass , the progenitor of sn 2012au likely had a large main sequence mass as @xmath109 , for which the outer hydrogen envelope had been stripped away but the helium layer still remained .",
    "although sn 2012au is spectroscopically classified as sn ib , the bolometric luminosity is large and close to that of sn 1998bw , and the bolometric lc modeling also suggests that although sn 2012au had the helium envelope at the explosion , the structure of the ejecta in sn 2012au is similar to that of sn 1998bw .",
    "these , together with the high velocity absorption features , suggest that sn 2012au has a character close to hypernovae .",
    "finally , we note that independently similar results and discussions were given by @xcite , mostly based on later phase data than we analyzed in this letter . this may allow us to get an important insight because no grb - associated sne ib has been ever discovered .",
