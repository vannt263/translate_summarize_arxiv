    "since many years , the investigation of native and radiation - induced point - defects in semiconductors has attracted an ever - increasing interest in both theoretical and experimental studies .",
    "this is particularly true in the case of diamond , a wide - bandgap material characterized by well - known extreme physical properties ( high young s modulus and thermal conductivity , broad transparency range , high carriers mobility , etc . ) with attractive applications in different fields , ranging from microelectromechanical systems to heatsinks , laser windows , particle detectors , etc.@xcite indeed , the presence of defects in the crystal structure of diamond has a dramatic effect on its physical properties , from a structural,@xcite optical , @xcite and electronic@xcite point of view .",
    "a rigorous understanding of the physical effects of different typologies of defects is therefore of paramount importance in diamond science and technology .    despite the large number of studies on the subject , @xcite the defect formation mechanisms in diamond",
    "are still far from having been exhaustively explored and understood .",
    "this is especially due to the peculiar meta - stability of its crystalline structure , in which both sp@xmath3 and graphitic - like sp@xmath4 chemical bonds give rise to an unusual variety of different point - defects and related complexes . in this respect ,",
    "raman spectroscopy is the ideal experimental technique to study different carbon allotropes due to their characteristic vibrational features,@xcite and it has thus emerged as a prominent technique to investigate defect formation in irradiated diamond . @xcite",
    "the raman spectrum of pristine diamond consists of a single , sharp raman peak at 1332 @xmath1 , corresponding to the first - order scattering with triply - degenerated to(x ) phonons of f@xmath5 symmetry . the damaged crystal , on the contrary ,",
    "is characterized by several additional features , which have been attributed to different types of sp@xmath4 and sp@xmath3 defects .",
    "the most prominent features observed at higher raman frequencies with respect to the first - order line are located at about @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xmath1 features are commonly attributed to sp@xmath4 defects such as the `` dumb - bell '' split - interstitial defect.@xcite on the other hand , different tentative attributions have been formulated for the @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xmath1 peaks , involving both vacancy@xcite and intrinsic / nitrogen interstitial defects.@xcite at lower raman frequencies , two broad bands are measured in defective diamond , in the @xmath10 @xmath1 and @xmath11 @xmath1 ranges , respectively.@xcite these vibrational bands are rather articulated and their attribution is unclear .",
    "@xcite as these broad bands qualitatively resemble the vibrational density - of - states of pristine diamond,@xcite they have been tentatively attributed to sp@xmath3 defects .",
    "@xcite moreover , the first - order raman peak itself is subjected to both broadening and red - shifting when damage is introduced in the crystal,@xcite an effect which can be interpreted by considering that the peak frequency in the first - order raman spectrum primarily depends on the bond length and strength : as the inter - atomic distance increases in defective diamond , the raman shift frequency lowers .",
    "due to recent advances in the theoretical development and computational implementation of quantum - mechanical fully - analytical methods for the _ ab initio _ evaluation of raman spectra of solids,@xcite computational raman spectroscopy has become an effective complementary tool in the interpretation of experimental spectra . as a first step towards the characterization of the raman spectral features of defective diamond , in this study raman spectra",
    "are computed as a function of concentration and different spin states of neutral vacancies , and compared to previous experimental results .",
    "the thermal nuclear motion of defective diamond is also characterized by means of converged lattice dynamical calculations and anisotropic displacement parameters ( adps ) .    within density - functional - theory ( dft )",
    "the global hybrid functional b3lyp  @xcite is adopted , which includes 20% of non - local exact hartree - fock exchange and is known to outperform other classes of functionals in the description of vibration properties of most solids  @xcite and in the accurate description of spin states.@xcite",
    "harmonic phonon frequencies , @xmath12 , at the @xmath13 point ( _ i.e. _ at the center of the first brillouin zone , fbz ) are obtained from the diagonalization of the mass - weighted hessian matrix of the second energy derivatives with respect to atomic displacements @xmath14 :  @xcite @xmath15 where atoms @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( with atomic masses @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) in the reference cell , * 0 * , are displaced along the @xmath20-th and @xmath21-th cartesian directions , respectively .",

    "the raman intensity of the stokes line of a phonon mode @xmath22 , active due to the @xmath23 component of the polarizability tensor @xmath24 , can be expressed as : @xmath25 the relative raman intensities of the peaks are computed analytically from the solution of second - order coupled - perturbed - hartree - fock / kohn - sham ( cphf / ks ) equations ,  @xcite exploiting a scheme recently implemented in the crystal14 program .",
    "@xcite the raman spectrum is then computed by considering the transverse optical ( to ) modes and by adopting a pseudo - voigt functional form : a linear combination of a lorentzian and a gaussian curve with fwhm of 8 @xmath1 .",
    "raman intensities are normalized so that the largest value is conventionally set to 1000 a.u .",
    "the calculation of other vibrational properties of solids ( such as thermodynamic quantities or thermal nuclear motion indices ) is a more demanding task as it implies knowledge of the phonon dispersion inside the full fbz .",

    "adps offer a convenient way to rationalize such atomic motions ; for a given temperature , an ellipsoid is associated to each atom , which provides information on the probability of finding that atom displaced from the equilibrium position .",

    "@xcite the lengths of the principal semi - axes of the ellipsoid and their orientations are given by the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath60 are usually expressed in units of 10@xmath61 @xmath62 .",

    "the convergence threshold on energy for the self - consistent - field ( scf ) calculations is 10@xmath65 ha for structural optimization and 10@xmath66 ha for vibration frequency calculations .",
    "the reciprocal space was sampled using a regular sublattice with shrinking factor of 16 ( or 8 , 4 ) for supercells containing 2 ( or 8 , @xmath67 64 ) atoms , respectively .",
    "the number of corresponding * k*-points in the irreducible part of the fbz is 145 ( or 29 , 10 ) , respectively when the full symmetry of the diamond lattice is preserved .",
    "a supercell approach was used to simulate the neutral vacancy , where a large periodic cell is created , which is a multiple of the unit cell of the perfect system , and an atom is removed at its center to create the defect .",
    "this scheme allows to effectively investigate the variation of any property with increasing defect concentration .",
    "three supercells were considered containing 32 , 64 and 128 atoms before vacancy creation .",
    "these cells correspond to defect densities of @xmath68 @xmath69 , @xmath70 @xmath69 and @xmath71 @xmath69 , respectively and will be referred to in the following as sc@xmath72 with @xmath73 number of atoms befor the vacancy creation .",
    "spin state of the neutral vacancy in the sc@xmath74 supercell is here considered for the defective system.,width=321 ]    the first - order raman peak in pristine diamond is here found at @xmath75 @xmath1 , to be compared with the experimental value of @xmath76 @xmath1 , which confirms the effectiveness of the global hybrid b3lyp functional in describing spectroscopic features of solids .",
    "as expected , all vibration frequencies at @xmath77 are found to be raman inactive .",
    "the presence of the vacancy breaks the translational symmetry of pristine diamond and reduces the point symmetry of the system , so that new raman - active modes emerge in the @xmath78 @xmath1 spectral range .",
    "this effect can be clearly seen in figure [ f_f1 ] , where we report a comparison between the raman spectra of pristine ( single peak in dashed blue line ) and defective ( spectrum in red continuous line ) diamond , modeled using a sc@xmath74 supercell containing a vacancy in the @xmath79 spin state .",
    "our results predict a large number ( about 90 ) of raman active phonon modes in the above - mentioned spectral range , most of which have significantly lower intensities as compared to the first - order peak .",
    "as different spin states of the vacancy defect determine different symmetries , we investigate the effect of this feature on the raman spectrum . in the present study",
    ", we consider the ground ( @xmath79 ) and first excited ( @xmath80 ) states of the defect .",
    "it is worth mentioning that both states involve unpaired electrons , localized on the four nearest neighbors of the vacancy , with spins in singlet and triplet configurations , respectively .",
    "it follows that open - shell calculations are performed in both cases .",
    "the two spin states are very close in energy and , thus , they both contribute significantly to the many - body wavefunction.@xcite in figure [ f_f2 ] raman spectra computed with the sc@xmath74 supercell in the two spin states are reported .",
    "the main spectral features of the two cases are very similar , with slight differences in the positions and intensities of the observed peaks : i ) a red - shifted first - order peak compared to pristine diamond ; ii ) a large number of raman - active modes at lower frequencies , approximately in the range @xmath78 @xmath1 ; iii ) no peaks appearing above the first - order one .",
    "the analysis of the normal modes @xmath81 allows to determine which spectral regions are mostly dominated by atomic motions involving nearest neighbors of the vacancy . from this analysis",
    ", we find that : i ) the first - order peak only slightly involves atoms close to the vacancy ; ii ) the spectral region below about 750 @xmath1 is due to soft phonon modes , which strongly involve motion of those atoms , as expected ; iii ) an intermediate spectral region in the range 750 - 1100 @xmath1 is characterized by a small contribution from nearest neighbors ; iv ) in the range 1100 - 1300 @xmath1 , normal modes are more affected by atoms close to the vacancy .",
    "supercell , for two different spin states of the defect : @xmath79 ( red continuous line ) and @xmath80 ( blue dashed line).,width=321 ]    at this point , we investigate the effect of defect concentration on computed raman spectra .",
    "since the spin state only slightly affects the spectroscopic features of the spectrum , just the @xmath79 case will be considered .",
    "three different supercells are here explored , namely sc@xmath74 , sc@xmath82 and sc@xmath83 , which correspond to defect densities of @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 @xmath69 , respectively .",
    "the three corresponding raman spectra are reported in figure [ f_ff2 ] , where it is shown that the effect of an increasing defect concentration is two - fold : i ) a red - shift and lowering of the intensity of the first - order peak ; ii ) large differences in peak positions and intensities in the @xmath78 @xmath1 region , in which local variations in defect concentration would likely determine a significant broadedning of the spectrum .",
    "two sub - regions can be isolated in terms of the average intensity of the peaks : a first one with lower intensity between 400 and 1050 @xmath1 and a second one with higher intensity between 1050 and 1300 @xmath1 .",

    ".,width=321 ]    the inset of figure [ f_ff2 ] shows the experimental raman spectrum of defective diamond from ref .",
    ", where the features in the @xmath78 @xmath1 range match with the present calculations .",
    "this evidence is rather striking , particularly if it is considered that , as shown above , raman features exhibit a spectral dispersion depending upon the particular spin state of the defect , with frequency shifts down to few wave - numbers , which might be hard to discriminate with the spectral resolution of common experimental setups . apart from concentration , two further issues may affect the comparability between present calculations and experimental data : i ) the defective system is here modeled as a periodic repetition of point defects with a spectral dispersion caused by the variation in the defect concentration , while in experimental conditions a random spatial distribution of point defects is obtained with all techniques employed to induce structural damage ; ii ) our model is here exclusively limited to isolated vacancy defects , while a broad variety of point ( or more complex ) defects is created in diamond upon ion implantation due to its peculiar meta - stability.@xcite taking into account the above - mentioned limitations of the model , the agreement between present quantum - mechanical calculations and experimental measurements constitutes a strong indication that isolated vacancies do play a prominent role in determining the spectral features of defective diamond below @xmath76 @xmath1 , thus confirming the hypothesis that raman features in the @xmath78 @xmath1 range should be mainly attributed to non - graphitic sp@xmath2 defects .",
    "@xcite    on the other hand , by comparing computed with experimental spectra in figure [ f_ff2 ] , it is apparent that no raman features are found in the simulated spectrum above @xmath76 @xmath1 , differently from the experimental one where several features are measured at about 1450 , 1490 , 1630 and 1680 @xmath1 .",
    "this evidence clearly indicates that the two experimentally measured sharp features at about 1450 and 1490 @xmath1 in defective diamond can not be attributed , as previously suggested , @xcite to isolated vacancies but rather to other kinds of defects involving , for instance , intrinsic or nitrogen interstitials.@xcite        in order to further confirm the reliability and predictiveness of the present model , a quantitative comparison between computed and experimental results is presented on the position of the first - order peak in the raman spectrum as a function of defect concentration .",
    "a quasi - linear red - shift of that peak is indeed observed as the defect density increases .",
    "present computed data are reported in figure [ f_ff3 ] ( black circles ) and compared with experimental data by jamieson _",
    "et al._@xcite ( red squares ) and by orwa _ et al._@xcite ( blue triangles ) . in the former experimental work,@xcite the raman red - shift was measured in a cross - sectional geometry at @xmath87 m depth in single - crystal diamond implanted with 3.5 mev he@xmath88 ions at increasing fluences ranging from @xmath89 cm@xmath64 to @xmath91 cm@xmath64 . in the present work ,",
    "those fluence values ( _ i.e. _ number of implanted ions per surface unit ) are converted into volumetric density of vacancies by multiplying by the average linear density of vacancies created per incoming ion at the above - mentioned depth , as derived from monte carlo simulations by use of the srim monte carlo code.@xcite similarly , in the latter experimental work,@xcite cross - sectional micro - raman measurements were performed at different depths ( _ i.e. _ probing different damage densities ) in a single - crystal diamond implanted with 3 mev he@xmath88 ions at a fixed fluence of @xmath92 cm@xmath64 . in this case ,",
    "vacancy densities values were already derived from srim simulations . in figure [ f_ff3 ] ,",
    "linear fits of computed and experimental data are also reported .",
    "the slope of our computed data , ( -7.6@xmath930.3)@xmath94 cm@xmath3 , is comprised between that of jamieson _",
    "et al._,@xcite ( -9.0@xmath930.1)@xmath94 cm@xmath3 , and that of orwa _ et al._,@xcite ( -2.2@xmath930.3)@xmath94 cm@xmath3 .",
    "we observe that present theoretical results exhibit a better consistency with the experimental results obtained by the cross - sectional raman probing the damaged structure at a fixed depth of 1 @xmath96 m under increasing implantation fluences,@xcite with respect to similar measurements performed on a sample implanted at a single fluence at different depths.@xcite this is surprising , given the fact that the same ions ( _ i.e. _ he@xmath88 ) were implanted at similar energies ( _ i.e. _ 3.5 mev and 3 mev , respectively ) in the two above - mentioned experiments .",
    "we interpret the better adherence of the theoretical results with the results obtained in ref . by considering that the employment of multiple implantations should minimize the effects of the uncertainty of an important implantation parameter , _",
    "i.e. _ the fluence , thus reducing the probability of possible systematic errors .",
    "overall , the good consistency between the reported computed data and the experimental results , despite the significant approximation of modeling the defective system as a regular pattern , represents a further indication that isolated vacancies play a major role in determining the measured raman features of defective diamond .      as anticipated in section [ subsec : adp ] , the computation of atomic adps represents an effective way to interpret thermal nuclear motions , allowing the quantification of the mean square atomic displacements in an intuitive way . indeed , with respect to vibration normal coordinates , which are collective modes , adps allow for an atomic partition of the thermal nuclear motion , providing a simple graphical tool to study these effects , even in complex structures .",
    "furthermore , adps can be experimentally derived from x - ray or synchrotron radiation diffraction measurements , thus allowing for validation of the theoretical predictions .",
    "the atomic thermal ellipsoids of pure diamond are perfectly spherical and the corresponding adp has a value which is commonly reported in the range ( 16.1 - 22.3)@xmath5210@xmath61@xmath62 , with a recent accurate determination of 18.1@xmath5210@xmath61@xmath62.@xcite the _ ab initio _ evaluation of adps requires lattice dynamical calculations to be performed by accounting for phonon dispersion . within the direct space ( frozen phonon )",
    "approach adopted here , increasing the size of the sc in the lattice dynamical calculation corresponds to increasing the sampling of the phonon dispersion within the first brillouin zone in reciprocal space .",
    ".computed adp ( in units of 10@xmath61@xmath62 ) of pure crystalline diamond at 298.15 k as a function of the size of the sc used for the lattice dynamical calculations , @xmath97 being the number of atoms in the sc .",
    "the corresponding number @xmath98 of * k*-points over which the fbz is sampled is also given .",
    "a recent experimental determination is reported as a reference.@xcite [ cols=\"<,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the computed adp of pure diamond at 298.15 k , as obtained by use of equation ( [ eq : adp ] ) , is reported in table [ tab : adp ] as a function of the size of the adopted sc .",
    "the effect of the inclusion of phonon dispersion is rather large : a @xmath13-only calculation ( performed on the primitive unit cell containing only @xmath97 = 2 atoms ) indeed provides an adp of 4.1 10@xmath61@xmath62 , which is then systematically increased as the size of the sc increases .",
    "convergence is reached for a sc containing @xmath97 = 256 atoms ( corresponding to a sampling of the fbz over 128 * k*-points ) , as it provides a value of 16.5@xmath5210@xmath61@xmath62 compared to 16.4@xmath5210@xmath61@xmath62 that is obtained with a sc with @xmath97 = 216 atoms . without further increasing the size of the sc , a denser sampling of phonon dispersion",
    "can then be achieved by fourier interpolation of the dynamical matrices .",
    "indeed , if equation ( [ eq : dynmat ] ) could be in principle used to compute and then diagonalize the dynamical matrices of just the @xmath99 * k*-points defined in section [ subsec : phon ] , this restriction would disappear when long - range electrostatic contributions to the force constants vanish within the sc ( as in the case of diamond ) . in this case , such an expression can be used to construct the dynamical matrices of a denser set of * k*-points through fourier interpolation .",
    "the adp obtained by fourier interpolation ( with a corresponding sampling of phonon dispersion over 65,536 * k*-points ) , starting from the largest sc , is 17.7@xmath5210@xmath61@xmath62 , which is in satisfactory agreement with the accurate experimental reference of 18.1@xmath5210@xmath61@xmath62,@xcite thus showing the accuracy of the convergence of the lattice dynamical description of the system .    ,",

    "i.e. _ the size , shape and orientation of the thermal ellipsoids of carbon atoms surrounding the vacancy in the lattice .",
    "as the vacancy constitutes a local perturbation to the lattice , the features of the adps in the vicinity of the defect are found to be almost independent from defect concentration ( at least at low defect concentrations ) .",
    "for this reason , we restrict our analysis to the sc containing 64 centers ( _ i.e. _ 63 carbons and 1 vacancy ) . in the inset of figure [",

    "when carbon atoms close to the vacancy are considered ( particularly for the four nearest neighbors , highlighted in yellow in the figure ) , the picture is rather different , as the ellipsoids are quite elongated along the axis connecting each atom to the center of the vacancy .",
    "in other words , atoms close to the vacancy do exhibit a larger thermal mobility towards the vacancy , as expected .    in order to determine the maximum distance over which the thermal motion of the atoms is affected by the vacancy",
