    "recently it was shown in @xcite that for general measures and kernels the @xmath8-boundedness of the operators @xmath7 forces them to converge weakly in @xmath8 .",
    "this means that there exists a bounded linear operator @xmath73 such that for all @xmath74 , @xmath75 motivated by this recent development it is natural to ask if limits of this type might exist if we remove the very strong @xmath20-boundedness assumption .",
    "but , as it was remarked in @xcite , by the banach - steinhaus theorem the converse also holds often ; weak convergence implies @xmath20-boundedness . and @xmath20-boundedness is known to fail very often , for example , by @xcite and @xcite , if @xmath2 is the cauchy kernel , @xmath76 , and @xmath3 has positive and finite 1-upper density , i.e , @xmath77 and is purely unrectifiable , that is , @xmath78 for every rectifiable curve @xmath79 .",
    "hence we can not hope for the full weak convergence in @xmath8 in such cases .",
    "however , we shall prove that the operators @xmath7 converge weakly in a restricted sense , see theorem [ main ] , under some mild assumptions for the measures and the kernels , including also many purely unrectifiable measures .    for these convergence results we shall also use the following theorem .",

    "we are able to prove rather easily the following fact .",

    "theorem [ main ] was proved in @xcite for more general kernels @xmath2 but under more restrictive porosity conditions on the measure @xmath3 .",
    "further discussions on boundedness and convergence properties of singular integrals with general measures can be found for example in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    throughout",
    "this paper @xmath93 means @xmath94 for some constant @xmath95 depending only on the appropriate structural constants , that is , the dimension @xmath96 , the exponent @xmath97 , the lipschitz constants of the lipschitz graphs and the regularity constants @xmath98 of the measures .",

    "[ nc ] for any @xmath132 , and any @xmath3 measurable function @xmath129 , @xmath133    this follows from the fact that @xmath3 is a carleson measure in @xmath134 , i.e. , @xmath135 a simple proof is given in @xcite for the case where @xmath136 but the same argument holds for general @xmath72 .",
