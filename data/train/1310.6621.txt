    "bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) confined in highly anisotropic potentials are commonly used to explore physical phenomena particular to lower - dimensional geometries , such as the berezinsky - kosterlitz - thouless phase transition  @xcite , as well as to implement technological devices , such as atom lasers  @xcite and metrological sensors  @xcite .",
    "thanks to high levels of experimental control , the reduced - dimension regime of highly anisotropic condensates can be achieved by making the characteristic energy scale of the tightly confined ( transverse ) dimension(s ) much higher than the interaction energy of the atomic cloud  @xcite . when the separation in energy scales is sufficiently large , nontrivial transverse spatial modes become virtually inaccessible and the system exhibits lower - dimensional behavior . in this regime ,",
    "the transverse spatial cordinates become physically redundant and can be effectively eliminated from the description of the gas in favor of a simpler reduced - dimension model , which involves only the lower - energy , longitudinal degrees of freedom .    within the mean - field approximation , dimensional reduction of the three - dimensional ( 3d ) gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation",
    "is often derived under the assumption that , due to the tight confinement , the scattering interaction does not couple to the high - energy transverse degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "given this assumption , the condensate mean field is factorizable relative to the longitudinal and transverse cordinates , with the latter being described by the ground - state wave function of the bare transverse trapping potential .",
    "theoretical analyses and recent experiments have shown , however , that in spite of the high anisotropy of the gas , such an idealized picture is not generally valid .",
    "effects of the scattering interaction on the transverse spatial modes have been shown to impact key properties of the gas , such as density propagation  @xcite , even beyond mean field , such as thermalization  @xcite , and have been predicted to produce significant deviations in interferometry of quasi-1d becs  @xcite .",
    "variational _ anstze _ are often proposed to derive effective reduced - dimension models that capture 3d - induced effects  @xcite .",
    "although sometimes effective , variational methods rely on various _ a priori _ assumptions about the condensate mean field and _ ad hoc _ trial functions that can not be applied to general trapping potentials . in this paper , we instead use the perturbative method developed in  @xcite to study the reduced dimensionality of highly anisotropic becs and its connection to the entanglement between the condensate s spatial degrees of freedom .",
    "we show that this technique provides an _ unbiased _ way to characterize the reduced dimensionality of the condensate as a regime of small spatial entanglement for general quasi-1d and quasi-2d geometries .",
    "moreover , this formalism provides the optimal product - state approximation to the exact 3d condensate wave function .",
    "this approximation , valid within the regime of low spatial correlations , decouples the transverse and longitudinal spatial degrees of freedom ; we show that regardless of the trapping geometry , the resulting reduced - dimension mean field corresponds to the solution of a longitudinal gp equation with additional attractive , three - body interactions .    by applying a thomas - fermi approximation to the longitudinal gp equation",
    ", we determine the reduced - dimension mean field analytically and derive a full 3d analytical estimate of the condensate s ground - state wave function .",
    "we use this analytical wave function to study the role of spatial correlations in highly anisotropic becs and to derive formulas for various ground - state properties of the condensate , such as the chemical potential and average density .",
    "such estimates are valid as long as the nonlinear scattering energy is much smaller than the transverse energy scales and much larger than the longitudinal kinetic energy .",
    "we assess the validity and performance of the ( analytical ) optimal product - state approximation by direct comparison against numerical integration of the 3d gp equation for quasi-1d and -2d potentials with different aspect ratios and various atom numbers .",
    "in addition , we benchmark our approach against the commonly adopted variational _ anstze _ of  @xcite , which assume a gaussian distribution with variable width along the transverse dimension(s ) .",
    "although our method applies to general trapping potentials , in this paper we focus on the case of quasi-1d and -2d harmonic traps , for which the variational technique  @xcite is also applicable .",
