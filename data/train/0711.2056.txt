    "longmore  4 ( lo  4 ) is a low - surface - brightness planetary nebula ( pn ) , discovered by longmore ( 1977 ) in the course of the eso - src southern - hemisphere sky survey . the first spectroscopic observations of its @xmath0 central star by mndez et  al .",
    "( 1985 ) led to a pg  1159@xmath1035 spectral classification .",
    "the pg  1159-type hydrogen - deficient planetary - nebula nuclei ( pnni ) and white dwarfs have spectra with conspicuous c  @xmath2 and he  @xmath3 absorption , and no balmer absorption .",
    "o  @xmath4 3811 - 3834    is often seen in emission . in various spectral - classification schemes , stars of this type",
    "have also been assigned to types `` o  @xmath5 '' or `` o(c ) . ''",
    "werner et al .  (",
    "2007 ) have recently revised the atmospheric parameters for lo  4 to @xmath6  k , @xmath7 .",
    "the spectrum of lo  4 is quite similar to that of k  1 - 16 , the first known pulsating pnn ( grauer & bond 1984 ) and a member of the gw  vir class of non - radial pulsators . the close similarity was borne out by the discovery of pulsations in lo  4 by bond & meakes ( 1990 ) .",
    "lo  4 was , at the time , only the second known pulsating pnn , having a strong periodicity near 31  min ( 1850  s ) , along with at least 8 other pulsation modes ranging from 831 to 2325  s.",
    "a transient mass - loss event that occurred in lo  4 in 1992 was discovered by werner et  al .",
    "( 1992 , 1993 ) . for several days the spectrum changed from pg  1159 to a [ wce ] type ( [ wc2 - 3 ] ) , having strong emission at the c  @xmath2 complex near 4659   , he  @xmath3 4686   , and o  @xmath4 5291   ,",
    "but then the star reverted to its normal pg  1159 spectrum .",
    "the mass - loss rate during this outburst was estimated at @xmath8 ( in units of @xmath9/yr ) . as emphasized by werner et al .",
    ", this event was a unique phenomenon , never before seen in any hot post - agb star .",
    "at the time of the 1992 mass - loss event , only a few spectra had ever been taken of lo  4 .",
    "this suggested that the outbursts may not be rare .    in order to explore this possibility",
    ", i began a program of regular spectroscopic monitoring of lo  4 in 2003 .",
    "i am using the 1.5-m telescope of the smarts consortium ( www.astro.yale.edu/smarts ) , located at cerro tololo .",
    "the spectrograph setup gives a wavelength coverage of 36505400   , with a resolution of 4.3    and a s / n per resolution element of @xmath103040 on good nights .",
    "31 spectra of lo  4 between 2003 feb 20 ( top ) and 2007 jun 28 ( bottom ) , obtained with the smarts 1.5-m telescope .",
    "the mean of all normal spectra has been subtracted from each individual spectrum .",
    "the normal pg  1159 spectrum was present on 29 nights .",
    "on the nights of 2006 jan 16 and nov 30 ( plotted with thick lines ) the c  @xmath2+he  @xmath3 complex was seen in emission .",
    "sharp `` absorption '' features are ccd artifacts .",
    "spacing between spectra is 0.375 of the continuum level .    between 2003",
    "february and 2007 june , 31 usable spectra were obtained at essentially random times .",
    "two new mass - loss events were detected during this interval .",
    "1 shows the 31 spectra , arranged in time sequence from top to bottom . in order to highlight variations in the spectra",
    ", the mean of all spectra has been subtracted from each individual spectrum .",
    "the resulting spectral differences show only residual noise , except on the two nights whose spectra are plotted with thick lines . on these two nights ( 2006 jan 16 and",
    "nov 30 ) lo  4 was in the [ wce ] state first discovered by werner et al .  in 1992 .",
    "2 shows the spectra in more detail .",
    "the top spectrum is the mean of all 29 observations in the pg  1159 state , showing the usual absorption lines of c  @xmath2 and he  @xmath3 , and the emission doublet of o  @xmath5 3811 - 3834   . during the two outburst nights in 2006 jan and nov ,",
    "however , c  @xmath2 and he  @xmath3 have gone into strong emission .",
    "the o  @xmath5 3811 - 3834    lines also appear to be stronger , and the 2006 nov 30 spectrum shows that o  @xmath5 5291    has gone into emission as well",
    ". both of these spectra are thus quite similar to that seen in 1992 by werner et al . as noted in fig .  2 ,",
    "the previous observations , taken 5356 days earlier , had shown the normal pg  1159 spectrum .",
    "the next observations , taken 15 and 17 days later , showed that the star had reverted to the pg  1159 state .",
    "the mean of 29 normal spectra of lo  4 is shown at top .",
    "on 2006 jan 16 ( middle ) and nov 30 ( bottom ) the star was in its transient [ wce ] stage , with strong c  @xmath2 and he  @xmath3 emission .",
    "spectra taken 5356 days earlier , and 1517 days later , showed the normal pg  1159 spectrum .",
    "tick marks on the @xmath11 axis are spaced at 0.5 of the continuum level .",
    "at present there seems to be no entirely satisfactory explanation for these spectacular , transient mass - loss episodes .",
    "one constraint is that the transient stellar wind is _ hydrogen - deficient _ , showing that the outbursts are unlikely to be related to an accretion event involving a companion star , debris disk , infalling planet , or other exotic external cause .",
    "the short durations of the episodes indicate that they are not driven on an evolutionary timescale .",
    "lo  4 does lie in the hr diagram for hot post - agb remnants near the boundary between [ wce ] and pg  1159 objects .",
    "this suggests that it may take only a small perturbation to move the star back into the [ wce ] stage .",
    "i thus speculate that occasionally many pulsation modes may be in phase , giving a temporarily large surface - temperature amplitude , which might trigger the outbursts .",
    "if so , we may expect the outbursts to occur periodically , at the beat period between the pulsation modes .",
    "three mass - loss episodes have now been seen in the @xmath1040 spectra of lo  4 that have ever been obtained .",
    "thus the star is in its `` high '' state @xmath108% of the time .",
    "the time - averaged mass - loss rate from the outbursts is @xmath10@xmath12/yr . since the mass - loss rate during lo 4 s normal pg  1159 state is @xmath103@xmath13/yr ( werner , priv .",
    "comm . , based on _ fuse _ observations )",
    ", the outbursts will have little additional effect on the evolution of the star .",
    "these abrupt transitions between the [ wce ] and pg  1159 states support the commonly accepted evolutionary link between the two types .",
    "further observations could test whether the outbursts occur periodically ( at the beat period ) , and other pnni lying near the [ wce]pg  1159 transition should be monitored .",
