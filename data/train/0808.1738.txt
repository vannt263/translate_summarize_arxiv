    "we do this in two ways .",
    "first , fitting a narrow colour range of 0.3@xmath5-@xmath60.8 and a single combination of age and metallicity ( [ fe / h]=@xmath70.8 , 8 gyr ) ; this corresponds to measuring the density of main - sequence stars as function of distance modulus .",
    "second , we use a wider colour range ( 0.1@xmath5-@xmath60.8 ) that includes turn - off stars , providing information on age and metallicity , and fit for three different stellar populations : a ` thick - disk ' population with [ fe / h]=@xmath80.8 and @xmath9=10 gyr , a ` halo ' population with [ fe / h]@xmath81.3 and @xmath9=13 gyr , and a broad ` general ' population with [ fe / h]=@xmath80.8 and 5@xmath1014 gyr .",
    ". the thick - disk - like population with [ fe / h]@xmath110.8 and @xmath9=10 gyr is colour - coded as red , the halo - like population with [ fe / h]@xmath111.3 and @xmath9=13 gyr as blue , and the broad population with [ fe / h]@xmath110.8 and 5@xmath1014 gyr as green . ,",
    "width=434 ]    from the fits described above we obtain the stellar mass in bins of constant distance modulus .",
    "this can be converted to spatial stellar mass density , giving contour maps such as the ones presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : dens_1pop ] for the single population fits .",
    "as expected , the density is clearly seen to decrease with increasing distance from the plane and from the galactic center .",
    "[ fig : pops_realpop ] is colour - coded with the type of population , based on the results from the fits with the thick - disk - like ( red ) , halo - like ( blue ) and very broad ( green ) populations .",
    "it is clear that the thick disk and halo are indeed fit with the appropriate populations , with the third , broad population mostly visible in the regions where the halo and disk populations have similar densities .    to increase the contrast of any substructures on top of the ` smooth ' distribution of stars",
    ", a smooth model must be subtracted from the stellar density maps .",
    "we assume a model with a double exponential thin and thick disk and an axisymmetric power - law halo . since the constraints on the disk are limited due to a lack of data at the smallest distances and the masking out of the lowest latitudes , we fix the thin and thick disk scale lengths at 2.6 and 3.6 kpc , respectively , and their scale heights at 0.3 and 1.0 kpc , respectively . using @xmath12=7.6 kpc ( following ( * ? ? ?",
    "* valle ( 2008 ) ) ) , our best - fit model gives a local thin disk density of 0.08 @xmath13pc@xmath14 , local thick disk and halo normalisations of 0.058 and 0.0016 , and an almost round ( @xmath15=0.9 ) halo with a power - law index of @xmath73 .",
    "these fit values agree well with previous determinations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( see e.g. siegel et al .",
    "2002 ) ) , although our fit favours a rounder halo than found in previous sdss studies by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* bell et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and juric et al .",
    "( 2008 ) ) .",
    "for the fits with three populations the model favours a lower thin disk density and higher normalisations for the thick disk and halo .",
    "this is due to the lack of a specific thin disk - like population in the fits .",
    "the residuals left after subtracting the best - fitting smooth models from the stellar density maps are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : subtracted ] . in this figure",
    "we have zoomed in to regions close to the plane , where the lls is expected to be present .    2 , 2@xmath161 , 1@xmath171 , and @xmath181 times the model density .",
    "white areas contain no information due to an absence of data or too high reddening .",
    "coloured contours show overdensities of @xmath162 , 2@xmath161 times the model density in the individual thick disk - like ( red ) , halo - like ( blue ) and broad ( green ) populations.,width=453 ]",
    "colour - magnitude diagram fitting can successfully reproduce the distance distribution of stars .",
    "this is corroborated by the fact that the disk and halo model that best fits the density distributions in fig .",
    "[ fig : dens_1pop ] gives densities and density ratios between the different model components that are in good agreement with previous determinations from star counts ( * ? ? ? * ( e.g. siegel et al . 2002 and references therein ) ) .",
    "after subtraction of a smooth galaxy model , a wealth of substructure becomes visible at low galactic latitudes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : subtracted ] ) .",
    "when searching for pieces of the lls , possible other overdensities need to be taken into account . the scans at @xmath0=50   and 70cross the hercules - aquila cloud ( * ?",
    "* ( belokurov et al . 2007 ) ) , a large overdensity extending both above and below the plane to high latitudes at a distances between 10 and 20 kpc .",
    "consequently , the extended overdensities seen in these scans in fig . [ fig : subtracted ] are likely to be related to this structure ( it appears slightly more distant in our results because hercules - aquila is more metal - poor than the populations used in our fits ) .",
    "furthermore , the sagittarius stream lies partly along the scan at @xmath0=203 , and is probably partly responsible for the overdensities there .",
    "however , even with these restrictions , a large number of overdensities is left , of which at least part corresponds to the lls .",
    "for example , the overdensities at d=10 kpc , z=+5 kpc in the @xmath0=178   and @xmath0=187   scans correspond to the original detection of the monoceros overdensity by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* newberg et al . ( 2002 ) ) .    more accurate analysis of the distances and metallicities of the detected overdensities is needed to piece together an overview of the lls and possible other substructures .",
    "one avenue of solving for the degeneracies between distance , age , and metallicity is by using colour - colour information to obtain metallicity estimates ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( ivezic et al . 2008 ) ) . with locations and metallicities for the overdensities in place ,",
    "a detailed picture of the lls will emerge that can help to shed light on the nature of this structure .",
