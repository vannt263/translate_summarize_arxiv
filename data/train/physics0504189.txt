    "this difference is particularly important when the number of interacting persons is small , as in the particular route choice game discussed below .",
    "note that oscillatory behavior has been found in iterated games before :    * in the rock - paper - scissors game @xcite , cycles are predicted by the game - dynamical equations due to unstable stationary solutions @xcite .",

    "we are interested in the case where both routes have different capacities , say a freeway and a subordinate or side road .",
    "while the freeway is faster when it is empty , it may be reasonable to use the side road when the freeway is congested .",
    "the `` success '' of taking route @xmath1 could be measured in terms of its inverse travel time @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the length of route @xmath1 and @xmath4 the average velocity when @xmath5 of the @xmath0 drivers have selected route @xmath1 .",
    "one may roughly approximate the average vehicle speed @xmath6 on route @xmath1 by the linear relationship @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the maximum velocity ( speed limit ) and @xmath9 the capacity , i.e. the maximum possible number of vehicles on route @xmath1 . with @xmath10 and @xmath11 ,",
    "the inverse travel time then obeys the relationship @xmath12 which is linearly decreasing with the road occupancy @xmath5 .",
    "other monotonously falling relationships @xmath4 would make the expression for the inverse travel times non - linear , but they would probably not lead to qualitatively different conclusions .",
    "the user equilibrium of equal travel times is found for a fraction @xmath13 of persons choosing route 1 .",
    "in contrast , the system optimum corresponds to the maximum of the overall inverse travel times @xmath14 and is found for the fraction @xmath15 of 1-decisions .",
    "the difference between both fractions vanishes in the limit @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , only experiments with a few players allow to find out , whether the test persons adapt to the user equilibrium or to the system optimum .",
    "we will see that both cases have completely different dynamical implications : while the most successful strategy to establish the user equilibrium is to stick to the same decision in subsequent iterations @xcite , the system optimum can only be reached by a time - dependent strategy ( at least , if no participant is ready to pay for the profits of others ) .",

    "this serves to reach generalizable results and to provide a better orientation to the test persons .",
    "note that the investigation of social ( multi - person ) games with linearly falling payoffs is not new @xcite .",
    "for example , schelling @xcite has discussed situations with `` conditional externality '' , where the outcome of a decision depends on the independent decisions of potentially many others @xcite .",
    "pigou has addressed this problem , which has been recently focused on by schreckenberg and selten s project survive @xcite and others @xcite .",
    "the route choice game is a special congestion game @xcite .",
    "more precisely speaking , it is a multi - stage symmetrical @xmath0-person single commodity congestion game @xcite .",
    "congestion games belong to the class of `` potential games '' @xcite , for which many theorems are available .",
    "for example , it is known that there always exists a wardrop equilibrium @xcite with essentially unique nash flows @xcite .",
    "this is characterized by the property that no individual driver can decrease his or her travel time by a different route choice .",
    "if there are several alternative routes from a given origin to a given destination , the travel times on all used alternative routes in the wardrop equilibrium is the same , while roads with longer travel times are not used .",
    "however , the wardrop equilibrium as expected outcome of selfish routing does not generally reach the system optimum , i.e. minimize the total travel times .",
    "nash flows are often inefficient , and selfish behavior implies the possibility of decreased network performance .",
    "this is particularly pronounced for the braess paradox @xcite , according to which additional streets may sometimes increase the overall travel time and reduce the throughput of a road network .",
    "the reason for this is the possible existence of badly performing nash equilibria , in which no single person can improve his or her payoff by changing the decision behavior .",
    "in fact , recent laboratory experiments indicate that , in a `` day - to - day route choice scenario '' based on selfish routing , the distribution of individuals over the alternative routes is fluctuating around the wardrop equilibrium @xcite",
    ". additional conclusions from the laboratory experiments by schreckenberg , selten _ et al . _",
    "are as follows @xcite :    * most people , who change their decision frequently , respond to their experience on the previous day ( i.e. in the last iteration ) .",
    "* there are only a few different behavioral patterns : direct responders ( 44% ) , contrarian responders ( 14% ) , and conservative persons , who do not respond to the previous outcome .",
    "* it does not pay off to react to travel time information in a sensitive way , as conservative test persons reach the smallest travel times ( the largest payoffs ) on average .",
    "* people s reactions to short term travel forecasts can invalidate these .",
    "nevertheless , travel time information helps to match the wardrop equilibrium , so that excess travel times due to coordination problems are reduced .",
    "a closer experimental analysis based on longer time series ( i.e. more iterations ) for smaller groups of test persons reveals a more detailed picture @xcite :    * individuals do not only show an adaptive behavior to the travel times on the previous day , but also change their response pattern in time @xcite . * in the course of time , one finds a differentiation process which leads to the development of characteristic , individual response patterns , which tend to be almost deterministic ( in contrast to mixed strategies ) . *",
    "while some test persons respond to small differences in travel times , others only react to medium - sized deviations , further people respond to large deviations , etc . in this way , overreactions of the group to deviations from the wardrop equilibrium are considerably reduced .",
    "note that the differentiation of individual behaviors is a way to resolve the coordination problem to match the wardrop equilibrium exactly , i.e. which participant should change his or her decision in the next iteration in order to compensate for a deviation from it .",
    "this implies that the fractions of specific behavioral response patterns should depend on the parameters of the payoff function .",
    "a certain fraction of `` stayers '' , who do not respond to travel time information , can improve the coordination in the group , i.e. the overall performance .",
    "however , stayers can also prevent the establishment of a system optimum , if alternating reciprocity is needed , see eq .",

    "in contrast to previous laboratory experiments , we have studied the route choice game not only with a very high number of repetitions , but also with a small number @xmath34 of test persons , in order to see whether the system optimum or the wardrop equilibrium is established .",
    "therefore , let us shortly discuss how the 2-person game relates to previous game - theoretical studies .    .",
    "two payoff values have been kept constant as payoffs may be linearly transformed and the two strategies of the one - shot game renumbered .",
    "our choice of @xmath35 and @xmath36 was made to define a payoff of 0 points in the user equilibrium and an average payoff of 100 in the system optimum of our investigated route choice game with @xmath37 and @xmath38.[fig2],width=377 ]    iterated symmetrical two - person games have been intensively studied @xcite , including stag hunt , the battle of the sexes , or the chicken game ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "they can all be represented by a payoff matrix of the form @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the success ( `` payoff '' ) of person 1 in a one - shot game when choosing strategy @xmath41 and meeting strategy @xmath42 .",
    "the respective payoffs of the second person are given by the symmetrical values @xmath43 .",

    "this game differs from the minority game @xcite or el farol bar problem @xcite with @xmath46 , as a minority decision for alternative 2 is less profitable than a majority decision for alternative 1 .",

    "@xcite , the 2-person route choice game appears on page 211 as game number 7 together with four other games with strongly stable equilibria .",
    "since then , the game has almost been forgotten and did not have a commonly known interpretation or name .",
    "therefore , we suggest to name it the 2-person `` route choice game '' . its place in the extended eriksson - lindgren scheme of symmetrical 2x2 games is graphically illustrated in fig .  [ fig2 ] .",
    "according to the game - theoretical literature , there are 12 ordinally distinct , symmetric 2x2 games @xcite , but after excluding strategically trivial games in the sense of having equilibrium points that are uniquely pareto - efficient , there remain four archetypical 2x2 games : the prisoner s dilemma , the battle of the sexes , chicken ( hawk - dove ) , and leader @xcite . however , this conclusion is only correct , if the four payoff values @xmath40 are specified by the four values @xmath47 .",
    "taking different values would lead to a different conclusion : if we name subscripts so that @xmath48 , a strategical conflict between a user equilibrium and the system optimum results when @xmath49 _ our conjecture is that players tend to develop alternating forms of reciprocity if this condition is fulfilled , while symmetric reciprocity is found otherwise . _",
    "this has the following implications ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) :    * if the 2x2 games stag hunt , harmony , or pure coordination are repeated frequently enough , we expect always a symmetrical form of cooperation . * for leader and the battle of the sexes",

    "* for the games route choice , deadlock , chicken , and prisoner s dilemma both , symmetric ( simultaneous ) and asymmetric ( alternating ) forms of cooperation are possible , depending on whether condition ( [ condition ] ) is fulfilled or not .",
    "note that this condition can not be met for some games , if one restricts to ordinal payoff values @xmath50 only .",
    "therefore , this interesting problem has been largely neglected in the past ( with a few exceptions , e.g. @xcite ) . in particular , convincing experimental evidence of alternating reciprocity is missing .",

    "although the instruction of test persons would have allowed them to conclude that taking turns would be a good strategy , the changing frequencies @xmath89 of some individuals was so small that cooperation within the duration of the respective experiment did not occur , in accordance with formula ( [ coop ] ) .",

    "the changing frequency is , therefore , critical for the establishment of innovative strategies : it determines the exploratory trial - and - error behavior . in contrast , cooperation is easy when test persons _ know _ that the oscillatory strategy is successful : when two teams , who had successfully cooperated in 2-person games , had afterwards to play a 4-person game , cooperation was _ always _ and quickly established ( see fig .",

    "however , when both players select route 1 and establish the related user equilibrium , no player can improve his or her payoff in the next iteration by changing the decision . nevertheless , it is possible to improve the long - term outcome , if _ both _",
    "players change their decisions , and if they do it in a coordinated way .",
    "note , however , that a strict alternating behavior of period 2 is an optimal strategy only in infinitely repeated games , while it is unstable to perturbations in finite games .",
