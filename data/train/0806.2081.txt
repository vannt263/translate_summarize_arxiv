    "the finite temperature behavior of the compact three - dimensional ( @xmath5 ) @xmath0 lattice gauge theory ( lgt ) is the subject of numerous investigations ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is well - known that at zero temperature the theory is confining at all values of the bare coupling constant  @xcite . at finite temperature",
    "the theory undergoes a deconfinement phase transition .",
    "both phenomena are expected to take place in @xmath8 qcd as well .",
    "therefore , the @xmath5 @xmath0 gauge theory constitutes one of the simplest models with continuous gauge symmetry which possess the same fundamental properties as qcd . in view of these common features",
    "the critical properties of @xmath5 @xmath0 lgt deserve comprehensive qualitative and quantitative understanding .    on the theoretical side one should mention two results regarding the critical behavior of @xmath5 @xmath0 lgt .",
    "the first result states that the partition function of @xmath5 @xmath0 lgt in the villain formulation coincides with that of the @xmath9 @xmath4 model in the leading order of the high - temperature expansion  @xcite . in particular , the monopoles of the original @xmath0 gauge theory are reduced to vortices of the @xmath9 system .",
    "the second result follows from the svetitsky - yaffe conjecture : the finite - temperature phase transition in the @xmath5 @xmath0 lgt should belong to the universality class of the @xmath9 @xmath4 model if correlation length diverges  @xcite .",
    "then , two possibilities arise : either the transition is first order or it is the same transition which occurs in the @xmath9 @xmath4 model .",
    "the @xmath4 model is known to have berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) phase transition of infinite order  @xcite .",
    "several important facts could be deduced from these results .",
    "first of all , the global @xmath0 symmetry can not be broken spontaneously even at high temperatures because of the mermin - wagner theorem .",
    "consequently , a local order parameter does not exist .",
    "secondly , one might expect the critical behavior of the polyakov loop correlation function @xmath10 to be governed by the following expressions @xmath11 for @xmath12 and @xmath13 \\ , \\label{pllowt}\\ ] ] for @xmath14 , @xmath15 . here , @xmath16 is the distance between test charges and @xmath17 is the correlation length",
    ". such behavior of @xmath18 defines the so - called _ essential scaling_. the critical indices @xmath19 and @xmath20 are known from the renormalization - group analysis of the @xmath4 model : @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the bkt critical point .",
    "therefore , the critical indices @xmath24 and @xmath20 should be the same in the finite - temperature @xmath0 model if the svetitsky - yaffe conjecture holds in this case .    the first renormalization - group calculations of the critical indices , presented in  @xcite , gave support to the conjecture even though they did not constitute a rigorous proof .",
    "the direct numerical check of these predictions was performed on lattices @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 in ref .  @xcite .",
    "though authors of ref .",
    "@xcite confirm the expected bkt nature of the phase transition , the reported critical index is almost three times that predicted for the @xmath4 model , @xmath28 .",
    "more recent numerical simulations of ref .",
    "@xcite have been mostly concentrated on the study of the properties of the high - temperature phase .",
    "we have to conclude that , so far , there are no numerical indications that the critical indices of @xmath5 @xmath0 lgt do coincide with those of the @xmath9 @xmath4 model .",
    "moreover , since a rigorous determination of the critical indices is not available even for the @xmath4 model one can hardly hope for a rigorous analysis of the critical behavior of @xmath5 @xmath0 lgt .",
    "the absence of reliable results in the vicinity of the bkt critical point was our primary motivation to study the deconfinement phase transition in @xmath5 @xmath0 lgt .",
    "the difficulties in computations of critical indices of the @xmath4 model are well - known and we do not intend to discuss them here ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a summary of recent results and problems ) .",
    "it should be clear however , that in the context of the @xmath5 theory a reliable determination of critical properties becomes even harder and requires simulations on very large lattices .",
    "we have decided therefore to attack the problem in a few steps .",
    "consider the finite - temperature model on anisotropic lattice with different spatial and temporal coupling constants ; as a first step , in this paper we investigate the limit of vanishing spatial coupling .",
    "the major advantage of this limit is that the integration over spatial links can be performed analytically .",
    "the result of such integration is an effective two - dimensional spin model for the polyakov loops .",
    "the latter can be studied numerically .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce the compact @xmath0 lgt on anisotropic lattice and study it for vanishing spatial coupling . in the section 3",
    "we describe briefly our numerical procedure .",
    "the result of simulations are presented in the section 4 .",
    "conclusions and perspectives are given in the section 5 .",
    "we work on a @xmath5 lattice @xmath30 with spatial extension @xmath31 and temporal extension @xmath32 .",
    "periodic boundary conditions on gauge fields are imposed in all directions .",
    "we introduce anisotropic dimensionless couplings in a standard way as @xmath33 where @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) is lattice spacing in the time ( space ) direction .",
    "@xmath36 is the continuum coupling constant with dimension @xmath37 .",
    "the finite - temperature limit is constructed as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the temperature .",

    "the plaquette angles @xmath45 are defined in the standard way .",
    "the correlation of two polyakov loops can be written as , e.g.",
    "@xmath46 \\right \\rangle \\ \\ . \\label{pl}\\ ] ]    as stated in the introduction we would like to explore the limit @xmath47 . consider the strong coupling expansion at @xmath48 . the general form of such expansion reads @xmath49 in this paper we study the zero - order partition function @xmath50 defined below .",
    "the series on the right - hand side of the last expression is known to be convergent uniformly in the volume , both for the free energy and for the gauge - invariant correlation functions .",
    "the uniform convergence guarantees the existence of the limit @xmath51 .",
    "the strong coupling expansion , done even in one parameter , might be far from the continuum limit .",
    "nevertheless , one expects that already the zero - order approximation captures correctly the critical behavior of the full theory .",
    "an example is given by the following polyakov loop model @xmath52 derived at finite temperature for @xmath53-dimensional @xmath54 pure gauge theory in the limit @xmath55 .",
    "here , @xmath56 .",
    "as is well known , this model reveals correctly the critical behavior of the original theory thus supporting our approximation .    in the zero - order approximation the integration over spatial gauge fields can be easily done and leads to the following expression for the partition function @xmath57   \\right ] \\ ,   \\label{pfbs0pl}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 belongs to the two - dimensional lattice @xmath59 and @xmath60 . here , @xmath61 are modified bessel functions and @xmath62 is the polyakov loop in the representation @xmath63 .",
    "for @xmath64 using the formula @xmath65 one finds @xmath66 \\ \\label{pfbs0nt1}\\ ] ] which is the partition function of the @xmath9 @xmath4 model .",
    "thus , in this case the dynamics of the system is governed by the @xmath4 model with the inverse temperature @xmath67 . for @xmath68",
    "the model ( [ pfbs0pl ] ) is of the @xmath4-type , i.e. it describes interaction between nearest neighbors spins ( polyakov loops ) and possesses the global @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "moreover , consider now two different limits - the strong coupling limit @xmath69 and the weak coupling limit @xmath70 .    in the leading order of the strong coupling limit one can easily find from ( [ pfbs0pl ] ) , up to an irrelevant constant , @xmath71 \\    \\label{pfbs0btl1}\\ ] ] which is again the @xmath4 model with the coupling @xmath72 given by @xmath73^{n_t }   \\ .\\ ] ] the polyakov loop vanishes while the correlations of the polyakov loops are given , at the leading order , by @xmath74^r \\ .",
    "\\label{plbs0}\\ ] ]    to study the weak coupling limit it is convenient to perform duality transformations which are well - known for the @xmath4 model .",

    "if there is a critical point at which the correlation length is divergent then on general grounds ( universality , limiting behavior , etc . )",
    "one assumes that the model described by the effective action  ( [ effaction ] ) indeed possesses the same critical behavior as the @xmath4 model .",
    "nevertheless , we are not aware of any direct numerical check of the universality for models of the type  ( [ effaction ] ) if @xmath82 for @xmath83 . in the following sections we present numerical simulations which give support for the expected bkt behavior of the model ( [ effaction ] ) .",
    "our results hold only for the model with @xmath79 defined by ( [ ck ] ) .",
    "we would like to stress that it is not obvious that for all possible @xmath79 the correlation length really diverges .",
    "for example , it was proven in ref .",
    "@xcite that the model with coefficients @xmath84 with sufficiently large @xmath85 , exhibits a first order phase transition , so that one could expect that the correlation length stays finite across the phase transition point .",

    "we studied the dimensionally reduced system with the metropolis algorithm , taking the first twenty @xmath89 couplings ( notice that @xmath90 ) .",
    "our goal is to bring evidence that the system exhibits bkt critical behavior _ for any fixed @xmath32_. this is trivially verified in the case @xmath64 , since by inspection of eqs .",
    "( [ spin_part ] ) and  ( [ spin_act ] ) , the theory reduces exactly to the @xmath4 model .",
    "therefore the case @xmath64 can be used as a test - field for the description and the validation of our procedure .    before presenting numerical results",
    "it is instructive to give some simple analytical predictions for the critical values @xmath67 at different values of @xmath32 . such critical values can be easily estimated if one knows @xmath91 for @xmath64 .",
    "since the model with @xmath64 coincides with the @xmath4 model one has @xmath92 and approximate critical points for other values of @xmath32 can be computed from the equality @xmath93^{n_t } \\ . \\label{crpointest}\\ ] ] solving the last equation numerically one finds @xmath91 .",

    "fitting with  ( [ chi_scaling ] ) , we find @xmath98 results agree with the universal @xmath4 value @xmath99 , although errors are quite large .",

    "the deviation for @xmath95 is most likely washed out by a fine tuning of the critical coupling within its error bars .",
    "one can observe , moreover , that the shape of the curve of values of @xmath100 changes qualitatively in the same way when the thermodynamic limit is approached for @xmath64 and @xmath97 , while it has a different behavior for @xmath95 .",

    "in particular , we restricted ourselves to the case @xmath55 and , by means of numerical monte carlo simulations on a dimensionally reduced effective theory , found evidence that the theory belongs indeed to the same universality class of the 2@xmath29 @xmath4 model .",
