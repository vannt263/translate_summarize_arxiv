    "phase transitions are characterised by the behaviour of an order parameter , @xmath6 , the expectation value of an operator . in the ordered phase of a system : @xmath7 , whereas in the disordered phase @xmath8 .",
    "a phase transition is first - order if @xmath9 discontinuously , whereas it is second - order if @xmath10 continuously . for a second - order transition ,",
    "the length - scale associated with correlations in the system diverges as @xmath11 and one can define a range of critical exponents that characterise the behaviour of certain macroscopic properties at the transition point . for example , in a system that is ferromagnetic for temperatures less than some critical value , @xmath12 , the magnetisation , @xmath13 , in the absence of an external magnetic field , behaves as @xmath14 for @xmath15 , where @xmath0 is the critical exponent . at the critical temperature",
    "the behaviour of the magnetisation in the presence of an external field , @xmath16 , defines another critical exponent , @xmath1 : @xmath17 . in a system that can be described by mean field theory",
    "these critical exponents are @xmath18    equilibrium , second - order phase transitions can be analysed using the renormalisation group , which leads to scaling laws that reduce the number of independent critical exponents to just two : @xmath0 and @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "it is widely conjectured that the values of these exponents are fully determined by the dimension of space and the nature of the order parameter .",
    "this is the notion of _ universality_@xmath19 ; i.e. , that the critical exponents are _ independent _ of a theory s microscopic details and hence all theories can be grouped into a much smaller number of universality classes according to the values of their critical exponents . if this is the case , the behaviour of a complicated theory near criticality is completely determined by the behaviour of a simpler theory in the same universality class .",
    "so , when presented with an apparently complicated theory , the problem is reduced to only that of establishing its universality class .",
    "quantum chromodynamics is an asymptotically free theory ; i.e. , there is an intrinsic , renormalisation - induced mass - scale , @xmath20 , and for squared momentum transfer @xmath21 , the interactions between quarks and gluons are weaker than coulombic : @xmath22 as @xmath23 . the study of qcd at finite temperature and baryon number density proceeds via the introduction of the intensive variables : temperature , @xmath24 ; and quark chemical potential , @xmath25 .",
    "these are additional mass - scales , with which the coupling can _ run _ and hence , for @xmath26 and/or @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "it follows that , at finite temperature and/or baryon number density , there is a phase of qcd in which quarks and gluons are weakly interacting , _ irrespective _ of the momentum transfer  @xcite ; i.e. , a quark - gluon plasma phase .",
    "such a phase of matter existed approximately one microsecond after the big - bang .    at @xmath29",
    "the strong interaction is characterised by confinement and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) , effects which are tied to the behaviour of @xmath30 at small-@xmath31 ; i.e. , its long - range behaviour . in a phase of qcd",
    "in which the coupling is uniformly small for all @xmath31 , these effects are absent and the nature of the strong interaction spectrum is qualitatively different .",
    "the path followed in the transition to the plasma is also important because it determines some observational consequences of the plasma s existence .",
    "for example  @xcite , the time - scale for the expansion of the early universe : @xmath32 , is large compared with the natural time - scale in qcd : @xmath33 , hence thermal equilibrium is maintained throughout the qcd transition .",
    "therefore if the transition is second - order the ratio @xmath34baryon - number / entropy , remains unchanged from that value attained at an earlier stage in the universe s evolution .",
    "however , a first - order transition would be accompanied by a large increase in entropy density and therefore a reduction in @xmath35 after the transition .",
    "hence the order of the qcd transition constrains the mechanism for baryon number generation in models describing the formation of the universe , since with a second - order transition this mechanism is only required to produce the presently observed value of @xmath35 and need not allow for dilution . in the absence of quarks , qcd has a first - order deconfinement transition , while with three or four massless quarks a first - order chiral symmetry restoration transition is expected  @xcite .",
    "what of the realistic case with two light quark flavours ?    based on the global chiral symmetry of qcd with two light quark flavours , it has been argued  @xcite that this theory and the @xmath36 heisenberg magnet are in the same universality class . as a field theory",
    ", the @xmath36 heisenberg magnet is characterised by an interaction of the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a function of temperature : @xmath39 at or above the critical temperature , @xmath40 , but @xmath41 for @xmath42 .",
    "if the interaction strength , @xmath43 , depends smoothly on @xmath24 and remains positive then , for @xmath42 , the classical minimum of this potential is at @xmath44 this model is familiar as the nonlinear @xmath45-model , often used to describe low - energy phenomena in qcd .",
    "it has been explored thoroughly and has a second order phase transition with critical exponents  @xcite @xmath46    one can examine the hypothesis that this model and qcd with two light quark flavours are in the same universality class via numerical simulations .",
    "such studies on an @xmath47 lattice suggest a second - order chiral phase transition with critical exponents  @xcite @xmath48 but do not decide the question .",
    "is obtained , which is characteristic of a first - order transition .",
    "these unexpected results might be artefacts of finite lattice spacing because introducing light dynamical quarks drives the simulations to stronger coupling and hence coarser lattices . ]",
    "these results were obtained through an analysis of the chiral and thermal susceptibilities ; a technique that can be applied in the study of any theory .",
    "herein we illustrate the method via an analysis of two dyson - schwinger equation ( dse ) models of qcd , which also allows us to explore the hypothesis further .",
    "dyson - schwinger equations provide a renormalisable , nonperturbative , continuum framework for the exploration of strong interaction effects and have been used extensively at @xmath49  @xcite in the study of confinement and dcsb , and in the calculation of hadron observables  @xcite .",
