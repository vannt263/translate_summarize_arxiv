    "<S> a major challenge of materials science is nowadays the synthesis of new predicted polymorphic structures with desired properties . </S>",
    "<S> atomistic simulations combined with enhanced sampling techniques  @xcite provide a powerful computational tool for investigating the mechanism and the energetics of transformations in materials , but the standard approaches for phase transitions lack of transferability . despite the simplicity of its molecular unit , water is a challenging system in this context because of its uniquely rich polymorphism @xcite and predicted but yet unconfirmed features @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we show that using a novel set of coordinates , capturing changes in the topology of the interatomic network , we are able to systematically track transitions among liquid , amorphous and crystalline forms throughout the whole phase diagram of water , including the nucleation of crystals @xcite above and below the melting point . </S>",
    "<S> our general approach is not specific to water and could be applied to any structural phase transition , including those occurring in oxides and metals .    </S>",
    "<S> computational structure prediction methods  @xcite have strongly contributed to the rapid increase of new predicted phases of materials with enhanced properties for applications ( see , e.g. , ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , at present , no general approach has been developed for guiding experiments through the pathways connecting stable structures of condensed matter . moreover , </S>",
    "<S> metastable phases are very often involved in phase transitions  @xcite and sometimes their kinetic stability is very high . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in order to recover the global minimum structure , one needs to find specific routes , by e.g. acting on pressure or temperature , in a way that is not at all trivial to guess  @xcite . a precise understanding of transition mechanisms and the corresponding kinetics is therefore the key to explain and control the behavior of matter . the case of water is emblematic because several experiments have disclosed connections between stable and metastable phases  @xcite and recently simulations have highlighted the importance of metastable states in understanding the mechanism of phase transitions and related transformations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a classic example is the connection between the crystalline ice stable at ambient pressure ( ice  i ) , and the low - density amorphous ( lda ) and high - density amorphous ( hda ) ices : by compressing ice  i up to 10 kbar at @xmath0 80  k one obtains hda instead of ice  vi,@xcite which may be transformed into lda by decompression of hda at 130 k  @xcite or by heating recovered hda at ambient pressure to beyond 130 k ; @xcite finally ice  i is recovered by heating up lda . </S>",
    "<S> similar connections between crystalline and amorphous ices are found in the high - pressure region of the water phase diagram where a very - high - density amorphous ( vhda ) ice , plastic ices and crystalline structures with complex hydrogen - bond network ( e.g. ice vii ) have been observed or predicted .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite molecular dynamics ( md ) , a simulation method that yields the atomic trajectories as a function of time at given thermodynamic conditions , is in principle able to track such transitions . the kinetic barriers are however generally too large to allow an efficient exploration of the configuration space within typical md timescales . to comply with that , </S>",
    "<S> it has been so far necessary to introduce ( i ) simplistic models for intermolecular interactions  @xcite and/or ( ii ) seeding techniques  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another approach consists in using enhanced sampling techniques that accelerate the occurrence of rare events by focusing on low - dimensional order parameters , also called collective variables ( cv ) . yet </S>",
    "<S> the cvs available to describe phase transitions are specifically designed for a given type of structural transformation  @xcite , while no general cv scheme has been proven successful for a wide class of problems , in particular those involving amorphous systems . </S>",
    "<S> recently , distance metrics developed for condensed matter  @xcite have been proven to be successful in classifying structures in molecular or extended systems based on their atomic environment and/or interatomic network .     </S>",
    "<S> +      here we show that by combining enhanced sampling techniques with a novel cv based on a general metric we are able to define in an efficient way the topological space of transformations among liquid , amorphous , and crystalline forms of water . </S>",
    "<S> this allows exploring at will the phase diagram along pathways connecting minimum - energy structures with a single , general approach , capable , as a byproduct , to characterise their mechanism and energetics . </S>",
    "<S> our cv scheme relies on the concept of _ generalised distances _ between configurations of the system , as defined from relative atomic positions ( eq . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) , and it only requires to postulate the initial and final states of the target transformation , without any assumption on the pathway . </S>",
    "<S> the transformation is represented in a two - dimensional space @xmath1 of path cvs @xcite , with @xmath2 quantifying the progress of the transformation and @xmath3 allowing to discriminate between different pathways and to represent transitions to states that are not the target ones ( more details can be found in section methods ) . in figure </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : path]-a we draw the pathways we followed on the phase diagram of a realistic model of water @xcite , _ navigating _ within and across free - energy basins using standard md and enhanced sampling techniques , respectively . concerning the latter , we used metadynamics  @xcite for the discovery of continuum pathways between locally stable configurations , and umbrella sampling  @xcite for the reconstruction of precise free energy landscapes . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : path]-b shows a two - dimensional map ( see also ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) of distances between the visited crystalline and amorphous structures : the metric employed to define the cvs is able to scatter the different phases in a way that recalls the topology of the phase diagram , representing kinetically connected phases as neighbors , and kinetically disconnected ones as far apart .     </S>",
    "<S> +       +   +        as a starting point we analyze the crystallization of ice  i both from the liquid and the lda phases at @xmath4  bar and over a range of temperatures around the melting point ( @xmath5  k for the adopted interatomic potential  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the initial configurations have been respectively obtained by cooling down an equilibrium liquid phase from @xmath6  k and heating up a lda structure from @xmath7  k. both crystallization transitions have been achieved multiple times in metadynamics simulations at @xmath8  k and @xmath9  k and they are all characterized by ( i ) a nucleation mechanism that we show in figure [ fig : cryst ] for the lda  </S>",
    "<S> ice  i transformation at @xmath8  k , </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) the formation of a crystal nucleus of cubic symmetry ( ice ic ) , and ( iii ) a final state with either a perfect cubic symmetry or made up of layers of cubic ic and hexagonal ih ice ( see last snapshot in figure [ fig : cryst]-a ) . </S>",
    "<S> this last feature is in agreement with experimental findings  @xcite , and our results show that the formation of stacking disordered ice  i may proceed via the merging of ic - nuclei rather than only via random growth of ic and ih layers  @xcite . in figure </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cryst]-b we display the free energy profiles for the liquid  ice  i and lda  </S>",
    "<S> ice  i transformations , respectively above and below the melting point . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated relative stabilities of the various phases agree with the phase diagram of the water model , and the order of magnitude of the free - energy profiles is consistent with free - energy differences calculated in previous works @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that crystallizing the liquid above the melting temperature , in the bulk , without any seeds and with a very realistic water model , shows that our approach allows to perform very challenging transformations even in unfavorable conditions , reaching metastable states ( here ice i ) starting from the global minimum .     </S>",
    "<S> +     in order to carry on our _ continuous journey _ towards high pressure , we follow the experimental routes by cooling down ice  i to @xmath7  k , and then compressing it at @xmath10  kbar using standard md : in the neighborhood of this point of the phase diagram we explore ( with enhanced sampling simulations ) the transformation to hda as a function of temperature and pressure . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the free - energy barrier decreases when temperature and pressure increase , as we show in figure [ fig : amorphous ] . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore we note that although the free energy of ice  i is higher than the one of hda already at @xmath10  kbar and @xmath7  k ( which is expected since ice  i is not the stable phase in this region of the phase diagram ) , the free - energy barrier is nonzero . </S>",
    "<S> this result is in accordance with a common interpretation of the ice  i  hda transformation  @xcite that can be seen as an extrapolation to low temperatures and high pressures of the ice  i  liquid coexistence line . </S>",
    "<S> even if this description is mostly qualitative , it certainly invigorates the idea that low - density crystalline ice is unstable with respect to denser disordered forms at high pressures , and that such instability occurs at higher pressures as temperature is decreased .     </S>",
    "<S> +      +   +      the hda phase we obtain is then ( i ) decompressed at ambient pressure and transformed into lda to close the _ loop _ of transitions at low pressure , ( ii ) compressed at @xmath11  kbar and transformed into vhda . </S>",
    "<S> the hda - vhda transformation connects the low - pressure and high - pressure regions that we explore in this work . </S>",
    "<S> the vhda phase is compressed and heated until it reaches @xmath12  kbar and @xmath6  k , and at this point we address its crystallization to ice  vii . while simulating the vhda </S>",
    "<S>  ice  vii transformation via metadynamics we observe that the system visits two additional metastable configurations . </S>",
    "<S> this result demonstrates that our method does not constrain the system to sample configurations along a simple path connecting the two reference structures , but rather allows it to follow complex mechanisms and discover new free energy basins . </S>",
    "<S> the metastable structures differ markedly from the other phases , as shown in figure [ fig : hp ] where we compare representative snapshots and the oxygen - oxygen radial distribution functions . the first metastable phase is identified as the plastic ice  vii - p , which had already been proposed by himoto _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> oxygen atoms are arranged in a rather ordered crystalline network , whereas the hydrogen bond network changes dynamically : the correlation decay time of molecular dipoles is more than one order of magnitude shorter than that of ice  vii at the same thermodynamic conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the second metastable phase ( labeled here `` ice  y '' ) is characterized by a tetragonal oxygen lattice and stacked layers of hydrogen - bond networks . </S>",
    "<S> we leave a detailed investigation of this phase for future works ( the atomic coordinates are provided in the supporting material ) . </S>",
    "<S> the flexibility of our method in representing transformations among several states in a two - dimensional cv space is illustrated in the free energy landscape connecting the three crystalline phases ( ice  vii , ice  vii - p and ice  y ) shown on figure [ fig : hp]-c .    in conclusion , we propose a versatile method allowing the efficient simulation of phase transitions in condensed matter . we illustrated the approach by tackling the difficult problem of poly(a)morphism in water . in particular , we simulated transformations between the lda , hda , liquid and ice  i phases in the low - pressure region of the phase diagram and among vhda and ice  vii in the high - pressure region . in both cases , important mechanistic informations could be extracted from the simulations , highlighting the role of metastable structures during phase transitions . thanks to a very general formulation , the proposed approach is not restricted to specific transitions of a single material ; it rather addresses a wide range of transformations of condensed matter . here </S>",
    "<S> the set of transformations includes the kinetically challenging cases of disorder - to - order ( amorphous - crystalline and liquid - crystalline ) transitions . </S>",
    "<S> the ability to discover transformation mechanisms , simulate nucleation events , and reconstruct free energy landscapes and kinetic barriers  all in a robust and systematic way  is highly complementary to structure prediction and materials discovery efforts , and it marks an important step towards the in - silico design of experimental routes for the synthesis of new materials with targeted properties </S>",
