    "estimating the frequency of mergers in the universe is a challenging task . besides the problems of defining a merger in contrast to an accretion event and finding such events , there is also the problem of the dependence on the environment , and the estimate of the merger timescales .",
    "for example , @xcite find that the merger rate evolves as @xmath7 with @xmath8 in rich cluster , whereas the merger rate of field galaxies is found to evolve less strongly .",
    "in a recent study @xcite find @xmath9 using visually classified mergers and @xmath10 using close galaxy pairs in a population of field galaxies .",
    "previous studies found @xmath11 ( carlberg , pritchet , & infante 1994 ) , @xmath12 @xcite , @xmath13 @xcite , @xmath14 @xcite and @xmath15 @xcite . this spread in the values of the merger index @xmath4 is partly due to different methods used in deducing the merger rates ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "correcting for selection effects in close pair studies , @xcite estimate that approximately @xmath16 of all nearby galaxies with @xmath17 are undergoing mergers .    on the theoretical side , gottlber , klypin , & kravtsov ( 2001 )",
    "used n - body simulations and merger trees based on the press - schechter formalism , to derive the merger rate .",
    "they found @xmath18 for dark matter halos . in earlier studies of merger rates in n - body simulations @xcite found @xmath18 and @xcite found @xmath19 in a critical universe and @xmath20 in an open universe . in a previous semi - analytical approach",
    "@xcite calculated the accretion rate of baryonic cores .",
    "they assumed that each halo has only one baryonic core , neglecting the effect of multiple cores in a halo .",
    "the purpose of this letter is a detailed investigation of the galaxy merger fraction and rate . in the following section the redshift dependence of the merger fraction and its dependence on the cosmological models , on the environment represented by the final dark halo mass , on the merger timescale , on the minimum mass of observed objects that would be identified as merger components , and on the definition of major mergers",
    "are investigated .",
    "besides allowing a better understanding of how the merger rates of different observed samples are related , these estimates will test cosmological models .",
    "we study spatially flat cdm cosmologies with @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 km s@xmath24mpc@xmath24 .",
    "we also study a quintessence model with @xmath25 and an equation - of - state @xmath26 ( e.g. caldwell , dave , & steinhardt 1998 ) .",
    "merger trees of dark matter halos were generated using the method described by @xcite , which is based on the extended press - schechter formalism @xcite .",
    "this method was modified as proposed by @xcite .",
    "the power spectrum is obtained from the fitting formula of @xcite and normalized by @xmath27 .",
    "we use the expressions derived by @xcite for the value of @xmath27 and the linear growth factor .",
    "the history of a dark matter halo is followed back in time until the masses of all its progenitors fall below a minimum mass of @xmath28 .",
    "a progenitor with mass below @xmath29 is assumed to inhabit a small galaxy which has @xmath30 the mass of the surrounding dark matter halo .",
    "whenever two halos merge the galaxies inside of them merge on a dynamical friction timescale as described by @xcite .",
    "from the observational point of view one can either estimate the fraction of visually confirmed mergers @xcite or the fraction of galaxies in close pairs ( e.g * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . to deduce the merger fraction",
    "it is necessary to correct the observed close pair fraction for background / foreground contaminations and to estimate how many of these physical close pairs are likely to merge ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "usually one refers to the merger rate .",
    "the connection between the merger rate @xmath31 and the merger fraction is @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the fraction of galaxies at redshift @xmath34 in close pairs which will merge on a timescale shorter than @xmath5 . since @xmath5 depends on the separation of pairs , specifying @xmath5 also determines the close pairs .",
    "in general , observers measure the separation between galaxies in pairs and use the dynamical friction estimate to deduce a merger timescale .",
    "we calculate the merger fraction by counting the number of galaxies at each redshift which are experiencing a merger on a timescale less then @xmath5 and normalizing them to the total number of galaxies at this redshift .",
    "the merger fraction of galaxies at redshifts @xmath35 is usually approximated by a power law of the form : @xmath36 where @xmath3 is the normalization to the local merger fraction ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for our analysis we consider only binary major mergers , which we define as mergers with mass ratio between @xmath6 and 1 .",
    "fig [ power ] shows the result of a representative simulation for a halo of mass @xmath37 at @xmath38 , adopting @xmath28 , @xmath39 , and a merger timescale of 1 gyr for the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "we find in all investigated cases that the merger rate and the merger fraction as a function of redshift can be approximated by a power law at redshifts @xmath40 , in agreement with the observations . at higher redshifts",
    "the merger rate flattens , which was also found by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in general , a range of final halo masses will contribute to the merger events seen in observational surveys . to take this into account and to estimate environmental effects we choose six different halo masses @xmath41 at redshift @xmath38 ( @xmath42 ; in units of @xmath43 ) .",
    "[ mass ] shows the dependence of @xmath3 and @xmath4 on @xmath41 and @xmath5 . for increasing @xmath41 , @xmath3 decreases and @xmath4 increases systematically .",
    "this trend is consistent with the findings of @xcite .",
    "varying @xmath5 corresponds to different definitions of close pairs .",
    "the three curves in fig . [ mass ] are exponential laws of the form @xmath44 , fitted to the merger fractions for different @xmath5 .",
    "the parameters used to fit the data points are @xmath45 and @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and @xmath49 and @xmath50 for @xmath5 equal to 0.5 gyr , 1 gyr and 1.5 gyr , respectively . in the same environment",
    ", that is the same final halo mass @xmath41 , @xmath3 increases with increasing merger timescale as binaries with larger separations are included .",
    "the merger index @xmath4 shows only weak variation .    for computational reasons mergers",
    "are only resolved above a minimum mass @xmath29 .",
    "mergers below this mass are neglected .",
    "this corresponds to observations with a magnitude limited sample of galaxies .",
    "the graphs in fig .",
    "[ majmer]a show the dependence of the merger index @xmath4 on @xmath51 .",
    "the filled circles are the results of merger trees with constant @xmath28 and varying @xmath41 .",
    "we compare these results with simulations for constant @xmath52 and varying @xmath29 , represented by open circles .",
    "the value of @xmath4 depends only on the ratio @xmath53 as @xmath54 .",
    "another important question is the influence of the definition of major mergers on the merger rate .",
    "the graphs in fig .",
    "[ majmer]b show the dependence of @xmath3 on different values of @xmath6 .",
    "an event is called major merger if the mass ratio of the merging galaxies is below @xmath6 and larger than 1 . as @xmath6 increases , @xmath3 increases .",
    "we also find that the merger index @xmath4 stays roughly constant for low @xmath6 and decreases at larger @xmath6 . a decrease in @xmath4 with larger",
    "@xmath6 has also been reported by @xcite .",
    "it is a result of the adopted minimum mass for merger events .",
    "the detectable amount of major mergers with large mass ratios decreases faster with redshift than for equal mass mergers , since the small masses drop faster below the minimum mass . in observed samples of close pairs",
    "@xcite and @xcite found that @xmath3 increased when they allow for larger @xmath6 , which agrees with our predictions .    how do the theoretical models compare to the observations ?",
    "the star in fig .",
    "[ mass ] is the measured merger fraction for field galaxies by @xcite , who used @xmath39 and the local merger fraction of @xcite .",
    "they identified close pairs as those which merge on a timescale less then @xmath55 gyr . to compare this merger fraction with our estimates",
    "one needs to take into account that the dark halos of field galaxies can vary over a range of masses and that the merger timescale is subject to large uncertainties .",
    "we therfore weighted the different merger fractions of our sample of field galaxies with halo masses @xmath41 between @xmath56 and @xmath57 according to the press - schechter predictions .",
    "the merger index @xmath4 and the local merger fraction @xmath3 for different @xmath41 were calculated using the fitting formulae as shown by the graphs in fig . [ mass ] and fig .",
    "[ majmer]a .",
    "we varied the the range of halo masses contributing to the sample by changing the lower bound of halo masses from @xmath58 to @xmath59 and changed @xmath5 within the range of 0.5 - 1.5 gyr .",
    "the results of this reasonable parameter range lie inside the shaded region in fig . [ mass ] .",
    "results for larger @xmath5 correspond to the upper part of the region and those for larger halo masses lie in the right part of the region .",
    "a comparison of our results with the observations shows , that the predicted merger index @xmath4 and the normalization @xmath3 are a factor 2 smaller than observed .    as a possible solution to this problem",
    "we have studied a quintessence model with @xmath60 .",
    "the qcdm model shows a shallower increase in the comoving number density of mergers with redshift than the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "there is however not a significant difference in the merger fractions .",
    "this results from the fact that the difference in the comoving number density is compensated by the length of the redshift range contributing to the merger fractions .",
    "the qcdm universe with an age of @xmath61 years is younger than the adopted @xmath0cdm universe with an age of @xmath62 years , which is the reason why the same @xmath5 refers to a larger redshift range in the qcdm universe .",
    "this result also emphasizes , that it will not be possible to break the degeneracy of these models by measuring merger rates . comparing @xcite results with those obtained from the combined caltech faint galaxy redshift survey ( cfgrs ) and canadian network for observational cosmology field galaxy survey ( cnoc2 ) ( r. carlberg , private communication ) , which includes also minor majors ,",
    "reveals that including minor mergers leads to a smaller merger index @xmath4 which is consistent with the predictions of our simulations .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that these two observed merger indices differ .",
    "using semi - analytical modelling we recover a power law for the evolution of the merger rates and fractions at @xmath63 , as has been reported in earlier work . varying the final mass @xmath41 , the local merger fraction @xmath3 shows an exponential dependence on the merger index @xmath4 of the form @xmath64 .",
    "the actual values of the parameters @xmath65 depend mainly on the merging timescale and on the definition of major mergers .",
    "our predictions that @xmath4 will increase and @xmath3 will decreases in more massive environments is in qualitative agreement with observations .",
    "the merger index @xmath4 depends on the environment through the mass ratio @xmath53 .",
    "the logarithmic function @xmath66 fits the data well .",
    "we find a similiar behavior as @xcite , which have shown that if they extend their galaxy sample to fainter magnitudes the local merger fraction rises .",
    "in addition , we also find that the merger index decreases with higher mass ratios .",
    "this is also beeing found by comparing the results of the combined cfgrs and cnoc2 sample with those of @xcite .",
    "the adopted qcdm model does not show any significant difference to the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "therefore it is not possible to distinguish between these two models by measuring the merger rate of galaxies .",
    "our model predicts values for @xmath3 and @xmath4 which are too small by a factor of 2 compared with the predictions by @xcite who used the local merger fraction estimate of @xcite which was derived with a different definition of major mergers than theirs . as we have shown , the definition of a major merger is crucial for the expected merger fraction .",
    "our results indicate that the local merger fraction @xmath3 for the galaxy sample of @xcite who used @xmath39 must be less than the value measured by @xcite who used a larger @xmath6",
    ". a smaller value of @xmath3 would lead to an even larger discrepancy in @xmath4 compared to our results .",
    "another issue might be observational errors , like projection effects or uncertanties in the merger timescale estimates .",
    "our results strongly emphasize that the comparison of merger fractions deduced from different samples and with alternative techniques is questionable if the adopted mass range and the definitions of close pairs and major mergers are not the same .",
