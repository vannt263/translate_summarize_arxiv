    "a recently proposed model of 3d massive gravity @xcite , dubbed `` minimal massive gravity '' ( mmg ) , has bulk properties that are identical to those of `` topologically massive gravity '' ( tmg ) ( which propagates a single massive spin-@xmath0 mode @xcite ) but its boundary properties ( for ads asymptotics ) are different .",
    "specifically , mmg evades the `` bulk / boundary clash '' of tmg ; this is the impossibility ( for tmg ) of arranging for both central charges of the asymptotic conformal symmetry algebra to be positive while also arranging for the bulk mode to have positive energy .    in this paper",
    "we present a greatly simplified , and geometrical , analysis of the unitarity conditions of mmg .",
    "our results confirm those of @xcite but we also consider a slightly larger class of models by leaving free the normalisation of the parameters of the mmg action , and we cut in half the relevant parameter space by establishing equivalence under a `` duality '' transformation in the full parameter space .",
    "the final result is that unitarity restricts the parameters to a connected region of parameter space , up to equivalence .",
    "it has been proposed @xcite that the relevant asymptotic symmetry algebra for 3d gravity with flat - space asymptotics is the 2d `` galilean conformal algebra '' ( gca ) , obtained by contraction of the 2d conformal algebra .",
    "based on this proposal , flat space holography for tmg was initiated in @xcite , and it was argued that unitarity constraints on the central charges of the gca algebra could be satisfied only in a limit for which tmg degenerates to 3d conformal gravity , which has no local degrees of freedom . here we show that the same analysis , applied to mmg , leads to a flat space mmg model that is not conformal and still has local degrees of freedom , although its linearised limit coincides with linearised 3d conformal gravity , implying a linearisation instability .",
    "the tmg action can be written as the integral of a lagrangian 3-form constructed from three lorentz - vector one - forms : the dreibein @xmath1 , the ( dual ) lorentz connection @xmath2 and a lagrange multipler field @xmath3 imposing a zero - torsion constraint @xcite . using a 3d vector algebra notation for lorentz vectors we can write this lagrangian 3-form as @xmath4 = -\\sigma e\\cdot r + \\frac{1}{6}\\lambda_0\\ ,   e\\cdot e\\times e +   h\\cdot t   + \\frac{1}{\\mu } l_{lcs}(\\omega)\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the torsion and curvature 2-forms , respectively , and @xmath7 is the lorentz - chern - simons ( lcs ) 3-form for @xmath2 .",
    "this lagrangian 3-form is parametrized by the mass parameter @xmath8 and the dimensionless constants @xmath9 .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for details of conventions .",
    "the 1-form fields @xmath10 can be eliminated by their joint equations of motion , leading to an action for the 3-metric alone . for a particular choice of units for the 3d newton constant @xmath11 ( which has dimensions of inverse mass for unit speed of light ) , the resulting action is @xmath12 = \\sigma i_{eh}[g;\\lambda ] + \\frac{1}{\\mu } i_{lcs}[g]\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the ( 3d ) einstein - hilbert action , together with a cosmological constant term ( @xmath14 ) ; the lcs term is now the chern - simons action for the levi - civita affine connection .",
    "variation of this action yields the tmg equation @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the einstein tensor and @xmath17 the cotton tensor .",
    "the asymptotic symmetry algebra for an asymptotic ads vacuum with cosmological constant @xmath18 is the 2d conformal algebra @xcite .",
    "for tmg the ( left / right ) central charges are @xmath19 in the context of an ads / cft interpretation , this is the leading order result in a semi - classical approximation that is valid ( re - instating factors of @xmath20 ) when @xmath21 , and quantum consistency requires @xmath22 for some integer @xmath23 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we may assume , without loss of generality , that @xmath24 given this , we see from ( [ cpm ] ) that @xmath25 will be negative and the ( putative ) dual cft non - unitary , unless @xmath26 . however , the spin-2 bulk mode is a `` ghost '' ( i.e. has negative energy ) unless @xmath27 .",
    "this is the bulk / boundary unitarity clash .",
    "the mmg action can not be written in terms of the metric alone but it can be written in terms of the @xmath28-form lorentz - vector fields @xmath29 . the lagrangian 3-form is @xcite @xmath30= l_{tmg}[e,\\omega , h ]   + \\frac{\\alpha}{2 } e\\cdot h\\times h\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath31 is a new dimensionless constant ; for reasons explained in @xcite , the parameters are restricted such that @xmath32 the 1-form fields @xmath10 can not be consistently eliminated from the action but the complete set of equations of motion determine them uniquely in terms of the dreibein and its derivatives . when the resulting equation of motion is expressed in terms of the metric",
    ", one finds that @xmath33 where . ] @xmath34 and @xmath35 the @xmath36-tensor is @xmath37 where @xmath38 ( the 3d schouten tensor ) and the scalar @xmath39 is its trace .",
    "notice that the @xmath36-tensor involves only second derivatives of the metric , so the characteristics of the mmg equation will be those of the tmg equation , found by setting @xmath40 .",
    "we defer to @xcite for an explanation of how the mmg equation manages to be consistent with bianchi identities despite the fact that @xmath41 .",
    "the mmg action is proportional to the integral of the lagrangian 3-form ( [ mmgact ] ) with a proportionality constant that is itself proportional to @xmath42 .",
    "a rescaling of @xmath11 can be compensated by a rescaling of the mmg parameters . specifically , if @xmath43 , for _ positive non - zero _ constant @xmath44 , then the action is unchanged if @xmath45 and @xmath46 given that @xmath47 , this scaling allows us to choose a normalisation for the parameters such that @xmath48 , and this choice was made in @xcite . for tmg",
    "it makes sense to make this choice since setting @xmath49 leads to inconsistent field equations unless one also sets @xmath50 and then one is left with 3d conformal gravity , which has no local degrees of freedom . for mmg",
    "it is perfectly consistent to set @xmath49 , and allowing for this case leads to significant simplifications .",
    "for this reason , we impose no restriction on the parameter @xmath51 .",
    "we could use the scaling symmetry to set @xmath52 .",
    "this is especially attractive since unitarity of mmg ( with ads asymptotics ) requires @xmath53 @xcite so , anticipating this result , we could restrict to @xmath54 .",
    "however , imposing a normalisation condition on @xmath31 would complicate any discussion of the tmg limit .",
    "for this reason , we shall proceed without making any choice of normalisation for the mmg parameters .",
    "let us define a new set of fields @xmath55 for the action ( [ mmgact ] ) by setting @xmath56 this is an invertible field redefinition and therefore has no physical effect .",
    "however , the action in terms of the new fields has exactly the same form as it had for the old fields but in terms of the new parameters @xmath57 in other words , the map @xmath58 takes one mmg model into an equivalent mmg model .",
    "in particular , the mmg field equation ( [ sourcefree ] ) is unchanged because the parameters @xmath59 are @xmath60-inert .",
    "notice that the @xmath60-map is an involution ( @xmath61 ) so it relates _ pairs _ of equivalent models ; it is a `` duality '' in parameter space .",
    "notice also that @xmath62 recall that @xmath63 by definition , so @xmath60 has no fixed points .",
    "it follows that we may choose @xmath64 to have either sign , without loss of generality . every mmg model for which @xmath65 is equivalent to one with @xmath66 .",
    "this result raises a puzzle .",
    "when @xmath66 we can take the @xmath67 limit to recover tmg from mmg . given equivalence under the action of h , there should also be a limit to tmg when @xmath65 , but this can not be a simple @xmath67 limit because this would change the sign of @xmath64 .",
    "the resolution of this puzzle is that there is indeed another , less obvious , tmg limit when @xmath65 , which may be deduced by following the consequences of the @xmath60-map .",
    "one takes @xmath68 in such a way that for , non - zero @xmath31 , @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are finite in the @xmath67 limit .",
    "this limit now yields a tmg model with @xmath72",
    "maximally symmetric solutions of the mmg equation ( [ sourcefree ] ) are characterized by the value of the cosmological constant @xmath73 , which can be defined ( in the context of a vacuum solution ) via the equation @xmath74 .",
    "substitution into the mmg equation yields the relation @xmath75 in the case of an ads vacuum we have a unitarity constraint arising from the requirement of positive central charges for the asymptotic 2d conformal algebra , in addition to the bulk unitarity constraints .",
    "the unitarity conditions found for mmg in @xcite are    * no - tachyon condition : @xmath76 * no - ghost condition .",
    "when combined with the no - tachyon condition this becomes the inequality @xmath77 * positivity of both central charges : @xmath78 this inequality is valid on the assumption ( which we make without loss of generality ) that @xmath79 ( recall that @xmath80 ) and saturation of it defines , in analogy to tmg @xcite , the `` chiral '' limit .",
    "properties of chiral mmg have been investigated recently in @xcite .    for tmg",
    "it is obvious that the chiral limit implies saturation of the no - tachyon condition .",
    "this is no longer obvious for mmg but it is true nevertheless , as will emerge from the analysis to follow .",
    "we now define new dimensionless variables @xmath81 by @xmath82 observe that the inequality @xmath83 follows immediately from our assumption that @xmath84 .",
    "it also follows that @xmath85 where the final equality follows from ( [ quad ] ) .",
    "the new notation also simplifies the result of @xcite for the central charges of the asymptotic 2d conformal algebra , which can now be written as @xmath86    the unitarity conditions can now be written as linear inequalities in the @xmath81-plane :    * no - tachyon : @xmath87 . *",
    "no - ghost : @xmath88 .",
    "* positive central charges : @xmath89 .    to summarise ,",
    "the `` allowed '' region in the @xmath81-plane is defined by the linear inequalities @xmath90 within this allowed region , each point on the `` mmg hyperbola '' , @xmath91 corresponds to an mmg model with ads@xmath92 vacuum satisfying all ( bulk and boundary ) unitarity conditions .",
    "observe that the boundary lines @xmath93 and @xmath94 meet _ on the hyperbola _ at the `` chiral '' point with coordinates @xmath95 this confirms our earlier claim that the no - tachyon condition for mmg is saturated at the critical point . the other intersection of the two lines @xmath93 and",
    "@xmath94 is also on the hyperbola , but this corresponds to @xmath96 , and hence to @xmath97 .",
    "so boundary unitarity is violated at this other chiral point , although it is also true ( as we shall see shortly ) that some unitarity condition is violated in any neighbourhood of either chiral point .",
    "we will first use this new geometrical framework to recover standard results for tmg .",
    "we can do this by setting @xmath98 , in which case the mmg hyperbola becomes the tmg parabola @xmath99 the inequalities ( [ ineq4 ] ) simplify to ( i ) linear inequalities in the @xmath81-plane , @xmath100 which exclude the entire plane unless @xmath26 , plus ( ii ) the ( no - ghost ) restriction @xmath27 on the parabola parameters .",
    "these are contradictory requirements , so _",
    "the unitarity conditions can not be satisfied_.      the inequalities ( [ ineq4 ] ) imply that @xmath101 and hence that @xmath102 but this contradicts the requirements that @xmath87 and @xmath83 unless @xmath103 equivalently , unitarity requires @xmath104 , in agreement with the result of @xcite .    given @xmath53 , the second inequality of ( [ ineq4 ] ) can be written as another upper bound on @xmath105 : @xmath106 and this is a stronger upper bound than @xmath87 when @xmath107 .",

    "as observed earlier , we have seen that we may choose either sign for @xmath64 without loss of generality but we will ignore this fact , for now , in order to simplify comparison with the results of @xcite .",

    "it was argued in @xcite that , under certain conditions , the 2d gca algebra admits a unitary truncation to one copy of the virasoro algebra and the boundary theory becomes the chiral half of a cft .",

    "there are some similarities here with `` new topologically massive gravity '' ( ntmg ) @xcite for which the field equation is the same as ( [ flat ] ) but with the @xmath186-tensor of nmg replacing the @xmath36-tensor of mmg ; as observed in @xcite , both tensors have the same scalar trace .",
    "the @xmath36-tensor does not contribute to linear order in the equation ( [ flat ] ) , so its linearisation ( about flat space ) is just linearised 3d conformal gravity , which does not propagate any modes .",
    "in contrast , the non - linear theory does have local degrees of freedom ; a slight modification of the hamiltonian analysis of @xcite ( to allow for @xmath49 ) shows that the physical phase - space of the non - linear theory has dimension @xmath0 per space point .",
    "there is therefore a linearisation instability of the mmg model with field equation ( [ flat ] ) , analogous to the linearisation instability of ntmg @xcite .",
    "linearisation instabilities of this type occur when the linearised theory has a gauge invariance that is explicitly broken by interactions in the full theory .",
    "this phenomenon does not occur for tmg ( the linearisation instability at the chiral point discussed in @xcite is of another type ) but it does occur for nmg at partially massless ads vacua @xcite , where the accidental gauge invariance of the linearised theory is again linearized weyl invariance .",
    "the ( unique ) ads vacuum at the `` merger point '' of mmg is `` partially massless '' , implying a linearisation instability in that case too @xcite ; in fact , equation ( [ flat ] ) is the flat space limit of the mmg equation at its merger point .",

    "the four ( un - normalized ) dimensionless parameters of the mmg action are considered in two pairs ; one pair ( essentially , the cosmological constant and cosmological parameter in units of the square of the tmg mass parameter ) parametrises a plane",

    "we have called this the mmg hyperbola ; it degenerates to a parabola in the tmg limit .",
    "both the linear inequalities and the hyperbola depend on the other two parameters , which are the coefficient @xmath51 of the einstein - hilbert term and the coefficient @xmath31 of the new mmg term , which are restricted by the condition @xmath63 .",
    "the linear inequalities are inconsistent unless @xmath53 , in which case they determine an `` allowed '' region in the plane . in all cases ,",
    "only the upper left - hand branch of the mmg hyperbola is in this region , and this corresponds to a sign choice in the quadratic equation that gives the ads radius in terms of a cosmological parameter @xmath160 , which is restricted only by a simple inequality .    in our analysis ,",

    "vice versa_. we may therefore choose either sign for @xmath64 without loss of generality .",
    "the choice @xmath66 has the advantage that it simplifies the tmg limit , and the net result for this choice is that the only restrictions on the parameter space imposed by unitarity ( given ads@xmath92 asymptotics ) are , up to equivalence , @xmath189 this defines _ a single connected region in the space of parameters of the mmg action _ of the mmg equation ; @xmath53 implies @xmath104 but to find the analogous explicit restrictions on @xmath190 and @xmath191 would require an explicit inversion of the map defined by equations ( [ bars ] ) and ( [ barlamzero ] ) , and this is known only for @xmath50 @xcite . ] .",
    "it excludes tmg .",
    "if we fix the scaling invariance ( induced by a rescaling of the 3d newton constant ) by choosing @xmath54 then the above unitarity restriction reduces ( up to equivalence ) to @xmath192 of course , this is only a necessary condition for the unitarity of any 2d cft dual to mmg , but that is all we can test at the level of semi - classical effective 3d gravity , and it is a test that tmg fails but mmg passes .",

    "one new feature of mmg is the existence of two flat space limits .",
    "one is a minkowski limit of an mmg model with ads asymptotics satisfying all unitarity conditions , but this does not appear to be useful . instead , the flat - space limit that is available to both tmg and mmg is the one for which proposed unitarity conditions on central charges of the gca algebra can be satisfied . in this limit tmg",
    "degenerates to 3d conformal gravity but mmg degenerates to a very different theory with local degrees of freedom , although this are not apparent from the linearised theory .",
    "it thus appears that mmg has implications not only for ads holography but also for flat - space holography .",
