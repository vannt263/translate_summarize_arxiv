    "white dwarf stars are the end product of evolution of all stars with progenitor masses below 710.6  @xmath6 , depending on metallicity ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which corresponds to over 97% of the total number of stars .",
    "most white dwarfs do not generate energy from nuclear fusion , but radiate due to residual gravitational contraction .",
    "because of the degenerate equation of state , this is accompanied by a loss of thermal energy instead of increase as in the case of ideal gases ; the evolution of white dwarfs is therefore often simply described as cooling .",
    "the radius of a white dwarf star is of the same order of the earth s radius , which implies that they have small surface area , resulting in very large cooling times ( it takes approximately @xmath7 years for the effective temperature of a normal mass white dwarf to decrease from @xmath8  k to near @xmath9  k ) .",
    "consequently , the cool ones are among the oldest objects in the galaxy .",
    "therefore , studying white dwarfs is extremely important to comprehend the processes of stellar formation and evolution in the milky way ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    the number of known white dwarf stars is increasing fast thanks to the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "the first full white dwarf catalogue from sdss data @xcite was based on sdss data release 1 ( dr1 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . using data from the sdss data release 4 ( dr4 , * ? ? ? * ) , @xcite roughly doubled the number of spectroscopically confirmed white dwarf stars . in the white dwarf catalogue based on the sdss data release  7 ( dr7 , * ? ? ? * ) , @xcite increased the total number of white dwarf stars by more than a factor of two compared to the catalogue based on dr4 data .",
    "they also ( re)analysed all stars from previous releases . over @xmath10",
    "new spectroscopically confirmed white dwarf stars were reported by @xcite in the analysis of sdss data release 10 ( dr10 , * ? ? ?",
    "they also improved the candidate selection compared to previous catalogues , implementing an automated search algorithm to search objects which were missed by the other selection criteria .",
    "it was also the first white dwarf catalogue based on sdss data to fit not only da and db stars , but also dz , dq , and da+ms pairs .",
    "we continue such detailed analysis here with sdss data release 12 ( dr12 , * ? ? ?",
    "more details concerning the previous catalogues are presented in table [ catalogues ] .",
    "although the sdss increased the number of spectroscopically - confirmed white dwarf stars more than an order of magnitude prior to the sdss , the sdss sample is far from complete .",
    "target selection considerations of the original sdss ( up to dr8 ) implied that white dwarf selection for spectroscopy was incomplete ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . in the sdss dr12 ,",
    "the ancillary target programme 42 @xcite obtained the spectra of an additional @xmath11 colour selected white dwarf candidates that were missed by prior sdss spectroscopic surveys , i.e. , up to dr10 . here",

    "even though targeting in sdss produced the largest spectroscopic sample of white dwarfs , much of sdss i and ii white dwarf targeting required that the objects be unblended , which caused many bright white dwarfs to be skipped ( for a detailed discussion , see section 5.6 of eisenstein et al .",
    "2006 ) . the boss ancillary targeting programme @xcite relaxed this requirement and imposed colour cuts to focus on warm and hot white dwarfs .",
    "importantly , the boss spectral range extends further into the uv , covering from 3610    to 10140   , with spectral resolution 1560 - 2270 in the blue channel , and 1850 - 2650 in the red channel @xcite , allowing full coverage of the balmer lines .",
    "the targeted white dwarfs in sdss - iii were required to be point sources with clean photometry , and to have usno - b catalog counterparts @xcite .",
    "they were also restricted to regions inside the dr7 imaging footprint and required to have colours within the ranges @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and to have low galactic extinction @xmath34  mag .",
    "additionally , targets that did not have @xmath35 and @xmath36 were required to have usno proper motions larger than 2 arcsec per century .",
    "objects satisfying the selection criteria that had not been observed previously by the sdss ( anc  42 ) were denoted by the whitedwarf_new target flag , while those with prior sdss white dwarf photometric classification ( anc  43 ) are assigned the whitedwarf_sdss flag .",
    "some of the latter were re - observed with boss in order to obtain the extended wavelength coverage that the boss spectrograph offers .",
    "the targeting colour selection included da stars with temperatures above @xmath37  k , helium atmosphere white dwarfs above @xmath38  k , as well as many rarer classes of white dwarfs . hot subdwarfs ( sdb and sdo ) were targeted as well .",
    "our selection of white dwarf candidates among dr12 objects was similar to that reported for dr10 @xcite .",
    "we did not restrict our sample by magnitude , but by s / n@xmath39 .",
    "in addition to the 762 targeted white dwarf candidates after dr10 by anc  42 , we selected the spectra of any object classified by the elodie pipeline @xcite as a white dwarf , which returned 35708 spectra , an o , b or a star , which returned another 144471 spectra .",
    "our general colour selection from @xcite , which takes into account that sdss multi - colour imaging separates hot white dwarf and subdwarf stars from the bulk of the stellar and quasar loci in colour - colour space @xcite , returned 68836 new spectra , from which we identified another 2092 white dwarfs , 79 subdwarfs , 36 cataclysmic variables , and 3 pg  1159 .",
    "most of these spectra were overlapping with the elodie selections .",
    "we also used an automated search algorithm which assumes that the spectra of two objects with the same composition , effective temperature and surface gravity differ only in flux , due to different distances , and slope , because of reddening and calibration issues .",
    "this algorithm determines a polynomial of order between zero and two which minimizes the difference between each spectrum and a sample of models , allowing the determination of the most likely spectral class of each object . running",
    "this search over the whole 4.5 million spectra from dr  12 recovered more than @xmath40 of our sample and found @xmath41 white dwarf stars missed by previous searches .",
    "the data analysed here were reduced by the v@xmath42 spectroscopic reduction pipeline of @xcite . after visual identification of the spectra as a probable white dwarf , we fitted the optical spectra to da and db local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) grids of synthetic non - magnetic spectra derived from model atmospheres @xcite .",
    "the da model grid uses the ml2@xmath43 approximation , and for the dbs we use the ml2/@xmath44 approximation , to be consistent with @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our da grid extends up to @xmath45  k , but nlte effects are not included .",
    "@xcite concluded pure hydrogen atmospheres of da white dwarfs are well represented by lte calculations for effective temperatures up to 80000  k , but when traces of helium are present , non - local thermodynamic equilibrium ( nlte ) effects on the balmer lines occur , down to effective temperatures of 40000  k. @xcite concluded lte models should exclude traces of helium for the analysis of da white dwarfs .",
    "we fitted the spectral lines and photometry separately @xcite , selecting between the hot and cool solutions using photometry as an indicator .    of the @xmath11 objects targeted specifically as new white dwarf spectra by boss as ancillary programme 42 ,",

    "whitedwarf_sdss already observed , 5 in 80 colour selected stars are in fact quasars .",
    "@xcite reports that only 40% of their sdss colour selected sample with high probability of being a white dwarf has spectra obtained by sdss .",
    "the sdss spectra we classified as white dwarfs or subdwarfs have a g - band signal  to  noise ratio 85@xmath46s / n(g)@xmath463 , with an average of 12 . the lowest s / n in the g - band occurs for stars cooler than @xmath47  k , but they have significant s / n in the red part of the spectrum .",
    "we include in our tables the new proper motion determinations of @xcite and use them to separate dcs from bl lac spectra .",
    "we applied complete , consistent human identifications of each candidate white dwarf spectrum .      because we are interested in obtaining accurate mass distributions for our da and db stars , we were conservative in labelling a spectrum as a clean da or db , adding additional subtypes and uncertainty notations ( :) if we saw signs of other elements , companions , or magnetic fields in the spectra . while some of our mixed white dwarf subtypes would probably be identified as clean das or dbs with better signal - to - noise spectra , few of our identified clean das or dbs would likely be found to have additional spectral features within our detection limit .",
    "we looked for the following features to aid in the classification for each specified white dwarf subtype :    * balmer lines  normally broad and with a steep balmer decrement [ da but also dab , dba , dza , and subdwarfs ] * hei @xmath48  [ db , subdwarfs ] * heii @xmath49  [ do , pg1159 , sdo ] * c2 swan band or atomic ci lines [ dq ] * caii h & k [ dz , daz , dbz ] * cii @xmath50  [ hotdq ] * zeeman splitting [ magnetic white dwarfs ] * featureless spectrum with significant proper motion [ dc ] * flux increasing in the red [ binary , most probably m companion ] * oi @xmath51  [ dox ]    we also found 8 of stars to have an extremely steep balmer decrement ( i.e. only a broad h@xmath52 and sometimes h@xmath53 is observed while the other lines are absent ) that could not be fit with a pure hydrogen grid , or indicated extremely high gravities .",
    "we find that these objects are best explained as helium - rich das , and denote them da - he .",
    "we finally note that the white dwarf colour space also contains many hot subdwarfs .",
    "it is difficult to distinguish a low mass white dwarf from a subdwarf , as they are both dominated by hydrogen lines and the small differences in surface gravity can not be spotted by visual inspection alone .",
    "we therefore extended the model grid to @xmath54 for @xmath55  k , and @xmath56 for @xmath57  k , to separate white dwarfs ( @xmath58 ) , subdwarfs ( @xmath59 ) and main sequence stars ( @xmath60 ) ( see section [ section : masses ] and [ section : sub ] ) , but we caution that the differences in the line widths for das cooler than @xmath61  k and hotter than @xmath62  k are minor , with changing gravity .",

    "we have identified @xmath0 new white dwarf and subdwarf stars in the dr  12 of the sdss , and estimated the masses for das and dbs , as well as the calcium contamination in dzs and carbon / helium abundances in dqs .",
    "we were able to extend our identifications down to @xmath64  k , although these are certainly not complete , as we relied also on proper motion measurements to distinguish between cool dcs and bl  lac objects .",
    "proper motions are typically incomplete below @xmath65 .",
    "the resultant substantial increase in the number of spectroscopically confirmed white dwarfs is important because it allows the discovery of more rare objects like massive white dwarfs , magnetic white dwarfs , and he - dominated objects with oxygen lines . extending the work of @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we find 94 white dwarf stars with masses above 1  @xmath66 and s / n@xmath4615 .",
    "their volume corrected distribution is inhomogeneous which , if confirmed , indicates multiple formation processes , including mergers .",
    "the volume - limited sample of white dwarfs within 40 pc by @xcite finds  8% ( 22/288 ) of the local sample of white dwarfs have masses @xmath67 .",
    "massive white dwarfs are relevant both to the lower limit of core collapse sn and to white dwarf explosion or merger as sn  ia .",
    "@xcite estimates that the observed @xmath68 abundances provides an upper limit to the occurrence of exploding o - ne - mg cores at approximately 20% of all core - collapse supernovae .",
    "the existence of different types of sn  ia indicates different types of progenitors do exist .    with our spectral model grid now extending from @xmath69",
    ", we identified 2675 stars with hydrogen dominated spectra , and surface gravities @xmath70 larger than those of main sequence stars .",
    "time - series spectroscopy is necessary to check if they are binaries , in order to establish what fraction of the sda objects are elm white dwarfs .",
    "if they were to have main sequence radii , their distances would be tens of kiloparsecs outside the disk due to their distance moduli of @xmath71 .",
    "the substantial fraction of these stars that have measured proper motions , if at large distances , would also be runaway stars or hypervelocity stars ( @xmath72  km / s ) @xcite .",

    "determine that @xmath73% of all a stars in the solar neighborhood are in binaries .",
    "the pre - white dwarf ages of low metallicity stars with main sequence masses @xmath74 can amount to more than 8  gyr , so white dwarfs originating from binary interactions of low mass , low metallicity stars should still be visible as extremely low mass white dwarfs . if the stars we classified as sdas are in fact a - type main sequence stars , there is a large number of those at large distances from the galactic disk , and the galactic formation model would have to account for the continuous formation of low metallicity stars , perhaps from the continuous accretion of dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
