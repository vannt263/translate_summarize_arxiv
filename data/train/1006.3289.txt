    "a standard approach in noise time series simulation is based on carson s theorem @xcite .",
    "in fact , the superposition of randomly delayed pulses of a definite shape @xmath0 with arbitrary coefficients a@xmath1 gives rise to a pulse train @xmath2 whose power spectrum @xmath3 can be expressed in terms of the @xmath0 power spectrum @xmath4 according to @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a proper normalizing constant and @xmath7 is the fourier transform of f(t ) .",
    "the delays @xmath8 s are distributed according to poisson statistics and @xmath0 is usually required to have a zero mean value so that @xmath9 averages to zero .",
    "it can be shown that this result is independent of the density function used for the random amplitudes @xmath10 , if the variance of such distribution is fixed by the choice of the normalizing constant @xmath6 .",
    "+ the basic idea of the method consists then in searching a proper expression for @xmath0 so that the generated time series @xmath9 have the desired power spectrum @xmath3 . in other terms",
    "one is faced with the problem of inverting eq .",

    "then , @xmath9 can be built iteratively according to eq .",
    "( [ series ] ) with a proper choice of the random parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 . +",
    "this approach can be quite difficult whenever the desired spectrum is different from a simple power law and analytical approaches to the determination of @xmath0 are usually not straight - forward .",
    "in fact , the desired noise spectrum often shows complex behaviours in the measured frequency range .",
    "an example of such a common situation is shown in fig .",
    "[ menotre_spectra ] ( referring to the output of a few hundred microgram bolometric detector ) where we have a complex forest of microphonic lines overimposed to a smoothly varying distribution .",
    "the anti - aliasing filter cut frequency is also apparent by the quick drop of the power spectrum in the 100 - 200 hz region .",
    "+ the method proposed here consists in the determination of an @xmath0 which exactly matches a given noise power spectrum .",
    "this is essentially based on the choice of a particular ( out of an infinite number of possibilities ) function @xmath0 which satisfies eq .",
    "( [ carson_law ] ) and can be applied both to the case in which @xmath3 is known analytically or experimentally measured .",
    "+ let us begin with the discrete case of a sampled sequence @xmath12 $ ] . if we consider a finite number l of samples and assume ergodicity , then the power spectrum can be approximated by an ensemble average over a sufficiently large number of finite sequences @xmath13 $ ] of fixed length l according to @xmath14 \\simeq < |\\mathcal{f}(f_{l}[k])|^2 > \\label{powerspectrum}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 stands for the discrete fourier transform ( dft ) operator .",
    "since the sequence elements @xmath13 $ ] are supposed to be real , the corresponding power spectrum is a real even function and only half of its values are independent .",
    "in fact all the informations concerning the phases are lost in the quadrature and this is the reason why the inversion of eq .",

    "+ the simplest solution to eq .",
    "( [ powerspectrum ] ) is obtained by deleting the ensemble average and inverting the resulting expression .",
    "phases can be then randomly added assuming a flat distribution .",

    "this can be better understood by following some of the steps in the derivation of the carson s theorem .",
    "actually , by substituting eq .",
    "( [ series ] ) into the the power spectrum definition we obtain : @xmath25 \\right|^2 \\right >   = \\nonumber \\\\ = \\left",
    "< \\left| f(\\omega ) \\right|^2 \\cdot \\sum_{ij } a_i a_j e^{i\\omega(t_j - t_i ) } \\right > \\label{car01}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the last sum can then be separated into two different terms , one for @xmath26 , the other for @xmath27 .",
    "it can be shown that the latter is proportional to @xmath28 and therefore vanishes since we required @xmath0 to average to zero .",

    "the averaged sum on the right hand part can be thought as the average of the squared amplitude of each single pulse times their average number @xmath30 of occurencies . as a result",
    "we can express the average power spectrum as : + @xmath31    by comparing eq .",
    "( [ nps_fin ] ) and eq .",

    "( [ rate ] ) can now be used to generate the random amplitudes @xmath10 and the method is fully defined .",

    "* shift @xmath0 by @xmath11 imposing a periodicity constraint @xmath35 and multiply the result by @xmath10 .",
    "* sum iteratively over @xmath11 while @xmath36    the method can be used also when a theoretical ( analog ) estimate of @xmath37 is known .",
    "this is a common situation when the performance of an electronic circuit or of a detector are studied . in",
    "this cases the discrete power spectrum f[k ] can be in fact obtained by means of a proper frequency warping  @xcite of the analog theoretical estimate of the power spectrum .",
    "we would like to discuss in this section a few examples of application of the method to situations characterized by a complex structure of the desired noise power spectrum .",
    "we have chosen to this end two completely different noise sources : a single particle bolometric detector  @xcite and a jfet transistor  @xcite .",
    "indeed , being characterized by very different masses , frequency ranges and noise sources , they provide a clear example of the potential and versatility of the method .",
    "the concept of a single particle bolometric detector is very simple .",
    "it is an ideal calorimeter for which all the energy of the incident radiation is converted to heat giving rise to a temperature rise of the detector s body .",
    "such a temperature variation is then measured by means of a proper transducer which in our case will be represented by a doped thermistor whose resistance varies with temperature .",
    "a bias circuit is therefore needed and the observed signals express the voltage change at the thermistor terminals .",
    "working temperatures are as low as few tens of k in order to guarantee measurable temperature variations . in such working conditions",
    "different noise contributions can be recognized : the electronic noise coming from the acquisition chain , the johnson noise in bias circuit elements , the mechanical vibrations or instabilities of the of the experimental setup which may produce variation in the acquired voltage samples and finally the temperature instabilities due to thermodynamic fluctuations .",
    "the result is a complex noise power spectrum in which a forest of sharp lines is overimposed to a generally smooth behaviour .",
    "detector details ( eg . mass ) naturally affect the specific shape of the noise spectra ( range , lines , ... ) but usually do not alter the general trends described above  @xcite . following the common prescriptions  @xcite",
    "such spectra were obtained by averaging a few hundreds of randomly selected baselines ( defined as time windows in the absence of a signal ) .",
    "the same averaging procedure was followed to obtain a power spectrum of the output noise of a simple jfet transistor ( fig .  [ fet_spectra ] ) . following the recipe described in this paper and starting from the power spectra of a small mass bolometer and a jfet , a set of 50 simulated time series",
    "was generated .",
    "the respective power spectra were obtained according to eq.[powerspectrum ] by averaging their dft s . the result",
    "is directly compared in fig .",
    "[ menotre_spectra ] and [ fet_spectra ] with the original noise power spectra obtained experimentally .",
    "the ratio between the experimental and simulated power spectra is also reported in fig .  [ bolo_ratio ] and in fig .  [ fet_ratio ] .",
    "experimental and simulated baselines are also compared in fig .",
    "[ timedomain ] in the case of the jfet transistor .    in order to allow a more quantitative estimate of the level of agreement between the simulated and the original power spectra , a full set of simulated power spectra",
    "was generated in order to evaluate the distribution of the simulated values at each frequency .",
    "each power spectrum was obtained averaging 50 simulated time series .",

    "[ menotre_spectra ] .",
    "the distributions of the @xmath38/d.o.f . are also shown to demonstrate the correct statistical behaviour .",
    "the fluctuations of the simulated power spectra values depend of course also on the number of time series used for the average process ( eq.[powerspectrum ] ) .",
    "such a dependence was explicitely studied by generating a different set of power spectra and evaluating the corresponding average standard deviation from the desired otput , as a function of the number of averaged time series . the result",
