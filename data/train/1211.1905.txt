    "loft , the large observatory for x - ray timing , is one of the four mission candidates currently competing for a launch opportunity in 2022 - 2024 .",
    "the four missions were selected by the european space agency ( esa ) in february 2011 within the framework of the cosmic vision program .",
    "loft was specifically conceived to investigate the behavior of matter in presence of strong gravitational fields and at supranuclear densities by performing high - time - resolution x - ray observations of compact objects .",
    "measurements of the rapid x - ray flux and spectral variability in these sources can indeed provide constraints on the equation of states of neutron stars ( ns ) and measurements of black holes masses and spins ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : science ] ) . a representation of the current view of the loft satellite is provided in fig .",
    "[ fig : loft ] .",
    "the large area detector ( lad ) is the main instrument on board loft .",
    "it is a collimated experiment with a field - of - view ( fov ) of about 1 degree , reaching a peak x - ray sensitive effective area of @xmath010 m@xmath1 at 8  kev ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : area ] ) .",
    "the expected scientific throughput is of @xmath0240,000 cts / s for a source with a flux of 1  crab in the 2 - 80  kev energy range .",
    "the main operating energy band of the lad is 2 - 30  kev , where the expected spectral resolution is @xmath2260  ev ( 200  ev for single anode events , i.e. about 40% of the total counts ) . in the range 30 - 80",
    "kev , only a coarse energy resolution of @xmath02  kev will be available .",
    "the time resolution of the lad is 10  @xmath3s .",
    "the second instrument completing the loft payload is the wide field monitor ( wfm ) .",
    "this is a coded mask imager whose main goal is to detect new transient sources and state changes of any x - ray emitter that can be suitable for observations with the lad .",
    "the wfm will be observing about 1/3 of the sky at once and will be capable to provide data for each source in this fov with a spectral and timing resolution similar to that of the lad .",
    "we provide in sect .",
    "[ sec : instruments ] a detailed description of the loft payload , and describe in sect .",
    "[ sec : science ] some of the most recent improvements in the instruments design .",
    "all images and simulations used in the following sections are provided by the loft teams .",
    "in the current configuration of the loft mission ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : loft ] ) , the lad instrument comprises six panels attached to the spacecraft optical bench . on the top of it , the five units ( 10 cameras ) of the wfm are placed in a way to maximize the sky coverage ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "[ fig : area ] ) .",
    "the lad achieves an energy resolution ( fwhm ) better than 260  ev at 6  kev ( end - of - life , eol ) .",
    "the two enabling technologies of the lad are the large area silicon drift detectors developed originally for the alice experiment at cern ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* vacchi et al . 1991 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* rashevski et al . 2002 ) ) and the capillary plates collimators designed for the esa bepicolombo mission ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fraser et al . 2010 ) ) .",
    "the sdds have been optimized for loft to reach a configuration in which each detector is now 450  @xmath3 m thick and provides a total active area of 76  cm@xmath1 , read - out by two rows of anodes with a pitch of 970  @xmath3 m and a drift channel of 35  mm .",
    "the capillary - plate collimator was chosen to make advantage of the lead glass with millions of micro - pores , already proven to be efficient in collimating x - ray photons within a field of view ( fov ) of @xmath01  degree and energies up to 30 - 40  kev . in the current loft design , each of the sdd is equipped with a single collimator tile ( @xmath080 cm@xmath1 in area ) .",
    "there are in total 6 detector panels , each hosting 21 detector modules .",
    "16 sdds are allocated within each module ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* zane et al .",
    "a total of 2016 sdds are needed for the complete lad instrument .",

    "is provided in table  [ tab : lad ] .",
    "the wfm is a wide field coded mask imager working mainly in the 2 - 50  kev energy range ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : wfm ] ) .",
    "the instrument is designed from the heritage of the superagile experiment ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* feroci et al . 2007 ) ) , but presents very notable improvements in the low energy threshold , energy resolution and imaging capabilities .",
    "these are provided by the usage of similar sdds to that employed for the lad but optimized for imaging purposes ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* campana et al . 2011 ) ) .",
    "due to this optimization , the time resolution is kept of the order of @xmath010@xmath3s , whereas the spectral resolution is somewhat lower than that achieved by the lad ( 300  ev fwhm at 6  kev ) .",
    "the wfm sdds are able to measure the impact point of a photon with an accuracy that corresponds to few arcmin along the anode direction and few degrees along the drift direction ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* evangelista et al . ( 2012 ) ) ) .",
    "for this reason , each of the wfm unit ( 5 in total , see fig .",
    "[ fig : wfm ] ) comprises two orthogonal cameras to achieve a full 2d imaging capability ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* brandt et al . ( 2012 ) ) ) .",
    "this design has also the advantage of providing a strong redundancy in case of failure of one camera . in that case , indeed , a unit will be left with a fine resolution in one direction and a coarse resolution in the other , still ensuring some coverage of the sky in the corresponding region ) .",
