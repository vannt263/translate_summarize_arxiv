    "the classical theory of homogeneous isotropic turbulence applies to flows with zero velocity average so that all the turbulence properties are contained in the temporal velocity fluctuations @xcite .",
    "real turbulent flows , with non trivial boundary conditions and external forcing , often possess a non - zero mean flow that may or may not be stationary . quantifying the influence of turbulent fluctuations on the flow dynamics has been the corner stone of turbulence theory . in early experimental works",
    ", velocity measurements were performed through hot wire probes providing temporal variations of the velocity at fixed points . a natural parameter quantifying the intensity of turbulence",
    "has therefore been introduced as : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the velocity and @xmath6 refers to the time average of variable @xmath7 .",
    "while such a parameter clearly characterizes fluctuations in a homogeneous flow , one may question its relevance in more general anisotropic inhomogeneous flows where turbulence intensity depends on the measurement point ( cf . figs .",
    "[ map](a ) and ( d ) ) .",
    "for example , @xmath8 diverges around stagnation points or shears so that no robust global quantity can be built by integrating or averaging @xmath8 over the whole flow .",
    "this question is receiving an increasing interest since the advent of particle image velocimetry ( piv ) measurements which provide instantaneous snapshots of the velocity field .",
    "[ c][][1]@xmath9[c][][1.1]@xmath10    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     starting from the exact counter - rotating configuration , as @xmath11 is increased from zero , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are becoming larger for the half part of the flow corresponding to the slowest impeller and are decreasing for the other half part .",
    "this is directly connected with the position of the shear layer which gets closer and closer to the slowest impeller when @xmath12 increases ( cf . figs .",
    "[ theta](a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "this displacement goes on until the level of fluctuations is strong enough to activate the transition of the flow from two to one cell at @xmath13 .",
    "indeed , we clearly see in figs .",
    "[ thetabis ] the peaks in @xmath14 and @xmath3 that correspond exactly to the bifurcation point @xmath13 . with the annulus , where the bifurcation is much sharper",
    ", one could detect a critical divergence for @xmath15 ( cf .",
    "[ thetabis](b ) ) .",
    "we have introduced a new global quantity @xmath0 that characterizes turbulent fluctuations in inhomogeneous anisotropic flows .",
    "this time - dependent quantity is based on spatial averages of global velocity fields rather than classical temporal averages of local velocities .",
    "we have shown that , generally , properties of @xmath1 seems to be fully provided thanks to only two parameters , its time average @xmath2 and variance @xmath3 .",
    "these parameters generalize to inhomogeneous anisotropic flows the classical notion of turbulence intensity , based on local , single point measurements",
    ".    properties of @xmath2 and @xmath3 have been experimentally studied in the typical case of the von krmn flow for different forcing and geometries .",
    "we have shown that , in the fully turbulent regime , they are reynolds independent , like any classical inertial range quantity .",
    "however , @xmath2 and @xmath3 depend on forcing and geometry and faithfully reflect major changes in the flow topology .",
    "they can therefore be used as a new tool for comparison of different turbulent flow . in the present paper , we provided an example in which @xmath0 is used to characterize the turbulent bifurcation in the von krmn flow induced through differential rotation of the two impellers . finally , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are used to characterize the scale by scale energy budget as a function of the forcing mode as well as the transition between the two flow topologies .",
    "another interesting application would be the study of the generation of magnetic field by a turbulent flow , the so - called dynamo instability .",
    "this problem has attracted recently a lot of experimental attention @xcite . in the case where the corresponding turbulent flow has a non - zero mean value ,",
    "the dynamo instability may be seen as a classical instability problem , governed by the mean flow and the fluctuations @xcite . a natural question in this case",
    "is therefore how to quantify the relative level of fluctuations , and the deviations from the mean flow they induce , so as to implement efficient control strategies to decrease or increase their influence . since our global parameter",
    "quantify the difference between the instantaneous and the mean flow , they are natural candidate to discriminate between different dynamos .",
    "this has been recently illustrated in numerical simulations of taylor - green flow @xcite .",
    "no equivalent quantitative analysis has been performed for experimental dynamos . however , among these successful experimental dynamos , we can suspect that the karlsruhe @xcite and riga @xcite flows are characterized by values of @xmath0 lower than in von krmn flows . in the future",
    ", we plan to use these parameters for the analysis of recent results of the von krmn sodium ( vks ) experiment .",

    "a guide to the eye for the @xmath24 dependency is plotted with a dotted line.,title=\"fig : \" ]    as we have seen in sec .",
    "[ theor ] , the parameter @xmath25 can be seen as the average square distance between the instantaneous and the time averaged velocity fields .",
    "therefore , we can use a slight modification of @xmath25 to study the convergence towards the mean flow through statistical averaging .",
    "for this , we define @xmath26 the velocity field averaged around time @xmath27 over @xmath17 instantaneous fields .",
    "@xmath28 where @xmath29 is the total number of instantaneous fields . from a practical point of view , @xmath30 .",
    "then , we define : @xmath31 with this definition , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "moreover , @xmath34 measures the average square distance between the partially averaged field @xmath35 and the mean flow @xmath36 , so that its variations with @xmath17 can be used to study the convergence towards the mean flow .",
    "we can see in fig .",
    "[ deltaconv ] that this square distance , @xmath34 , decreases as @xmath24 , at least at large @xmath17 , what is typical of an uncorrelated fluctuating quantity .",
    "however , for the negative - rotation - sense - with - annulus case , the @xmath24 dependency is observed only at @xmath17 larger than @xmath37 .",
    "actually , in that particular setup , we have observed , by means of bubble seeding ( cf .",
    "end of sec .",
    "[ vortex ] ) , that even if the largest structures of the shear layer where removed by the annulus , a pair of coupled vortices appeared . these vortices are smaller than those we observe without the annulus , but their long time coherent precessing must induce long time correlations that slow down the decrease of @xmath38 .",
