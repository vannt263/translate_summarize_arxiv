    "at the time of the discovery of the first millisecond pulsar b1937 + 21 by backer et al .",
    "( 1982 ) around 350 pulsars were known . while most of these had periods around one second , the period of psr b1937 + 21 was a mere 1.6 ms , immediately raising the question in what respect such objects differ from long period pulsars . like the original binary pulsar , b1913 + 16 with a period of 59 ms , it was proposed that millisecond pulsars originate in binary systems in which a slowly rotating neutron star gets spun - up by mass transfer from the binary companion ( alpar et al .  1982 ) .",
    "this idea is supported by the fact that 80% of all millisecond pulsars found in the galactic plane are members of binary systems .",
    "these binary systems can be divided into three groups , depending on the mass of the companion star ( camilo 1996 ) , _ viz : _ low - mass ( presumably helium ) white dwarfs , high - mass ( presumably carbon - oxygen ) white dwarfs and other neutron stars . the progenitors are therefore thought to be either low - mass or high - mass x - ray binary systems .",
    "it seems fairly well established that millisecond pulsars are recycled pulsars originating from interacting binary systems .",
    "as the exact definition of `` millisecond pulsars '' in terms of period is somewhat arbitrary , it seems reasonable to treat all recycled pulsars as one class , referring to them as msps in the following .",
    "since the special evolutionary history distinguishes msps from long period pulsars , it is consequently interesting to compare the observed properties of these two classes of objects .",
    "the most obvious difference between the two classes is , of course , the observed range of pulse periods .",
    "the average period of slowly rotating pulsars ( hereafter referred to as ` normal ' pulsars ) is about 0.7 s. rapidly rotating pulsars exhibit pulse periods between 1.5 ms and about 60 ms .",
    "the period derivatives of msps are a few orders of magnitude smaller than those of normal pulsars , i.e. ,  of the order of @xmath0 or smaller compared to typically @xmath1 for normal pulsars .",
    "the derived characteristic ages , @xmath2 , are of the order of @xmath3 yr for msps and thus much larger than @xmath4 yr typically found for normal pulsars , indicating that msps represent an old population .",
    "similarly , calculating the surface magnetic field for msps , i.e. ,  @xmath5 gauss if @xmath6 is measured in seconds ( manchester & taylor 1977 ) , we find typically values of the order of only @xmath7 to @xmath3 gauss .",
    "an outstanding mystery is how the magnetic field decreases from @xmath8 gauss for normal pulsars by three to four orders of magnitude during or after the recycling process ( e.g. ,  bhattacharya & van den heuvel 1991 ; phinney & kulkarni 1994 ) .    for normal pulsars",
    ", the magnetic field seems to maintain a dipolar form even at distances of a few stellar radii above the neutron star surface ( phillips 1992 ; xilouris et al .",
    "1996 ; kramer et al .",
    "1997 ) . for msps",
    "it has been suggested that flux expulsion as a result of a pre - recycling spin - down ( e.g. , srinivasan et al .",
    "1990 ; jahan miri & bhattacharya 1994 ) , or the spin - up process of accreting mass on the neutron star surface itself ( e.g. ,  romani 1990 ; geppert & urpin 1996 ) could not only reduce the magnetic field strength , but could also have an impact on the magnetic field structure by disturbing the previously present dipolar field . moreover , near the surface of msps , magnetic multipoles might be present ( cf .",
    "ruderman 1991 ; arons 1993 ) which could increase the actual magnetic field strength over the @xmath7 gauss inferred from the spin down rates which are dominated by the field structure near the light cylinder ( cf .",
    "krolik 1991 ) .    despite these differences in the observational properties of msps and normal pulsars",
    ", it is often believed that the emission mechanism responsible for the observed radio emission is the same for both types of pulsars ( e.g. ,  manchester 1992 ; gil & krawczyk 1997 ) .",
    "however , there has been no systematic comparison of the emission properties of msps and normal pulsars . in a series of papers , we focus on this question which also constrains models of the emission mechanism of normal pulsars .",
    "if the same emission theory applies for normal pulsars and msps , it implies that the responsible radiation process has to work over three to four orders of magnitude in spin period and magnetic field , ruling out models which depend very much on these parameters ( see melrose 1992 ) .",
    "in fact , even if the emission process turns out to be the same for msps and normal pulsars , the special evolutionary history of msps can be expected to have a certain impact on the observed emission properties , so that it is important to separate such possible effects .    in the past , relatively little work has been done to compare spectral properties of msps and normal pulsars .",
    "this was primarily due to the small size of the sample  only 5 msps were known in the galactic disk prior to 1990 .",
    "the first careful study of msp spectra was presented by foster , fairhead , & backer ( 1991 ) , obtaining multi - frequency flux densities for four objects .",
    "recently , large - area surveys at parkes , arecibo , jodrell bank and green bank have been very successful at finding msps and , as a result , over 35 are presently known in the galactic disk .",
    "lorimer et al .",
    "( 1995b ) collected data for 20 msps mainly from the literature and compared them with a sample of normal pulsars , while bailes et al .",
    "( 1997 ) compared the luminosities of isolated and binary msps .",
    "navarro & manchester ( 1996 ) presented high - quality data for psr j0437@xmath94715 and demonstrated that msp profiles can exhibit an unusually large number of components .",
    "as pointed out by backer ( 1995 ) , a systematic study of the complexity of msp profiles however has not yet been undertaken .",
    "similarly , due to the limited resolution in many of the previously published msp profiles , it has been difficult to investigate the general width of msp profiles , which is necessary when making inferences about the intrinsic size of the emission beam .",
    "in this paper we present data obtained over three years during a monitoring project of msps at 1400 mhz .",
    "we used the effelsberg 100-m radio telescope of the mpifr and could thus observe all msps with declinations greater than @xmath10 which were strong enough to obtain data of high quality . as a result , we present profiles of 27 msps , of which 24 are located in the galactic disk , so that our sample contains about 60% of all known galactic disk msps .",
    "most of the profiles are of high quality both in signal - to - noise ratio and time resolution , thus allowing much more detailed studies than previously possible .",
    "therefore , in this and subsequent papers ( xilouris et al .  1998a , hereafter paper ii ; xilouris , kramer & von hoensbroech  1998b , hereafter paper iii ; kramer et al .",
    "1998 ) we investigate the largest homogeneous sample of msp data studied to date .",
    "we investigate the spectra and observed luminosity distributions of msps . attempting to infer the structure and size of the emission beam , we then study the profile properties of msps . searching for possible differences , a detailed comparison with the properties of normal pulsars",
    "is made ( cf .",

    "1996 , kijak et al .",
    "this study is complemented by the subsequent papers mentioned above to investigate the polarisation properties of msps , the stability of their pulse profiles and the emission height of their radio emission .",
    "the data presented here were obtained during a project which was initiated to obtain pulse time - of - arrival measurements for a number of msps during the upgrade of the arecibo telescope ( wolszczan 1996 , kramer et al .",
    "since april 1994 we have made regular observations using the 100-m radio telescope in effelsberg near bonn . in order to study the polarisation characteristics ,",
    "all four stokes parameters were recorded .",
    "we used a highly sensitive 1.4 ghz hemt receiver installed in the prime focus of the telescope , which is tunable between 1.3 ghz and 1.7 ghz .",
    "the set noise temperature of this system is 25 k at median elevations .",
    "the antenna gain at these frequencies is 1.5 k / jy , independent of elevation .",
    "we obtained left - hand ( @xmath11 ) and right - hand ( @xmath12 ) circularly polarised signals across a 40 mhz bandwidth usually centered at 1.41 ghz , but sometimes also tuned to 1.71 ghz .",
    "the lhc and rhc signals were mixed down to an intermediate frequency of 150 mhz and fed into a passive ( ` adding ' ) polarimeter providing the complex ( undetected ) outputs of @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( for a detailed description of this polarimeter and its calibration see hoensbroech & xilouris 1997b ) .",
    "each output was then split into 60 contiguous channels , each of 666 khz bandwidth , by four @xmath17 mhz filter banks .",
    "the individually detected filter outputs were delayed according to a pre - calculated delay time of the signals caused by dispersion due to the interstellar medium . finally , the filter outputs were added on - line and these incoherently de - dispersed signals were transferred to the effelsberg pulsar observing system ( epos ) backend .",
    "all four data streams could be sampled by the backend with a maximum resolution of 0.2 @xmath18s .",
    "however , the pulse period was typically divided into 1024 phase bins .",
    "the data were folded according to the computed topocentric pulse period which was updated every five seconds . until the beginning of 1995 the topocentric period was calculated using tempo ( taylor & weisberg 1989 ) , while later on we used timapr developed by doroshenko & kopeikin ( 1995 ) for computational convenience . a sub - integration of 15 s",
    "was finally transferred to disk for off - line reduction .    in order to monitor the gain stability and polarisation characteristics of epos",
    ", we performed regular calibration measurements using a switchable noise diode .",
    "the signal from this noise diode was injected into the waveguide following the antenna horn and was itself compared to the flux density of known continuum calibrators ( ott et al .",
    "1994 ) during regularly performed pointing observations . switching on the noise diode regularly after observations of pulsars allowed us to monitor gain differences in lhc and rhc signal paths and to calibrate the pulse energies by comparing these to the noise diode output . using this reliable method",
    ", we obtained a large number of flux density measurements presented in the following section .",
    "in table [ fluxtab ] we present the results of flux density measurements for 23 pulsars .",
    "these measurements were performed repeatedly at 1.41 and 1.71 ghz , and therefore we quote an effective frequency @xmath19 representing the weighted mean of the centre frequencies used . the error introduced by this procedure is at most 6% ( for a steep spectral index of @xmath20 ) and thus _ is _ much smaller than the uncertainties due to interstellar scintillation . in order to give an impression about the amplitude of any remaining uncertainties due to scintillation , we additionally quote the median of the measured flux densities which can be directly compared to the mean value .    in the following we compare the spectra and luminosities of msps and normal pulsars .",
    "as we will see , one has to take into account that the sample of msps was solely discovered during low frequency surveys , which favoured nearby msps due to severe dispersion and scattering limitations .",
    "in contrast , the sample of normal pulsars includes a large number of sources found in the previous high frequency surveys by johnston et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and clifton et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , which in turn favoured flat spectrum , high luminosity sources ( lorimer et al .",
    "in order to construct a more homogeneous set of sources which can then be compared , we can restrict the studied samples to those pulsars whose distance is not larger than 1.5 kpc , since we can reasonably assume that for a comparison of normal pulsars and msps the population of msps has been sufficiently sampled out to this distance ( lyne et al .",
    "additionally , it will be useful to compare the results obtained for this set of data with those of an analysis of msps and normal pulsars detected in a single survey . evidently , the recent parkes 436 mhz southern sky survey ( manchester et al .  1996 ; lyne et al .",
    "1998 ) provides such a homogeneous sample to verify our results .      using the flux densities which we have measured at 1.4/1.7 ghz presented in table  [ fluxtab ] ,",
    "we have used power law fits to calculate spectral indices based on our flux densities and those published for lower frequencies .",
    "corresponding references and resulting spectral indices are given in table  [ fluxtab ] .",
    "we also included data presented by foster et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , and the recent observations of four msps ( j1022 + 1001 , j1713 + 0747 , b1855 + 09 and j2145@xmath90750 ) at 4.85 ghz by kijak et al .",
    "( 1997a ) .",
    "if estimated uncertainties for flux densities found in the literature were not specified , we assumed a typical error of at least 30% due to the expected severe scintillation effects . in cases where we believe that scintillation imposes an even larger uncertainty , we accounted for this effect by increasing the estimated error . additionally , for those pulsars which are not included in our sample but discussed in the literature , we derived spectral indices for 11 further msps located in the galactic disk ( second part of table  [ fluxtab ] ) .",
    "our subsequent analysis does not include psrs j2019 + 2425 and j2322 + 2057 , although we present pulse profiles for these sources .",
    "for both these objects the number of flux density measurements was too small to derive a reliable mean value for 1.4/1.7 ghz .",
    "presently only flux densities at 430 mhz are given in the literature ( nice , taylor , & fruchter  1993 ; nice & taylor 1995 ) .    in order to compare the spectra for galactic disk msps and normal pulsars",
    ", we used a set of spectral indices for 346 normal pulsars which was derived from data presented by malofeev et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , lorimer et al .",
    "( 1995b ) and also taylor et al .",
    "we find that the average spectrum of msps seems to be steeper than that of normal pulsars , i.e. we derive a mean spectral index of @xmath21 for a set of 32 msps located in the galactic disk and a mean index of @xmath22 for normal pulsars in the same frequency range .",
    "the median values for both samples are @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "although the mean spectrum for msps seems to be somewhat steeper , both distributions appear very similar . a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test yields a probability of 36% that they are drawn from the same parent distribution .",
    "however , as already discussed , the sample of normal pulsars is obviously biased towards distant , flat spectrum sources . removing this bias by restricting the compared data sets to those sources which are closer than 1.5 kpc",
    ", we actually find mean spectral indices which are essentially the same , i.e.  @xmath25 ( msps ) and @xmath26 ( normal pulsars ) with median values of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "comparing these distributions of 18 msps and 55 normal pulsars ( fig .",
    "[ specindhist2 ] ) , we find an even higher ks - probability of 50% that the underlying parent distribution is the same . as a final confirmation",
    ", we compare the spectral indices of nearby msps and normal pulsars detected by the parkes survey . in this case , we obtain mean spectral indices of @xmath29 ( msps ) and @xmath30 ( normal pulsars ) and a ks - probability of 53% that both distributions are the same . we thus conclude that there is no apparent difference in the spectra of normal pulsars and msps .",
    "this is somewhat contrary to the first spectral study of 4 msps ( foster et al .",
    "1991 ) in which msp spectra appeared to be steeper on average than normal pulsars .",
    "the larger sample of objects available to us shows that steep spectra msps are the exception rather than the rule",
    ".    obtaining more data at high and low frequencies in the future , i.e. ,  above 2 ghz and below 400 mhz , will provide interesting information , particularly if msp spectra also show the typical steepening at a few ghz and a low frequency turn - over , which are both often observed for normal pulsars ( malofeev et al .",
    "1994 ) . indeed , the spectrum of b1937 + 21 presented by foster et al .",
    "( 1991 ) indicates a low - frequency turn - over .      for birth - rate studies of msps",
    "it is particularly important to compare their luminosities to those of normal pulsars .",
    "since we can estimate the uncertainties of our homogeneous sample of flux densities obtained at 1.4/1.7 ghz better than those of values published for 400 mhz by various authors , we compare distance - corrected flux densities observed at 1.4 ghz for both msps and normal pulsars . this is possible since we have seen that the spectra of msps and normal pulsars are essentially the same .",
    "consequently , we calculate values @xmath31 ,",
    "i.e. flux density measured in mjy ( table  [ fluxtab ] ) times square of the distance in kpc@xmath32 .",
    "we find that msps are apparently one order of magnitude less luminous than normal pulsars ( see fig .",
    "[ lum1400 ] ) .",
    "the mean value of @xmath33)$ ] is only @xmath34 for our sample of 31 msps located in the galactic disk compared to @xmath35 for 369 normal pulsars ( lorimer et al .",
    "1995b ; taylor et al .",
    "this is the reason why msps appear as relatively weak sources at high radio frequencies , so that only a small number of them could be detected at frequencies as high as 4.85 ghz ( kijak et al .",
    "1997a ) . removing the obvious bias from both samples by restricting our analysis to all those sources which are closer than 1.5 kpc",
    ", we note that this difference in luminosity becomes less prominent ( fig .",
    "[ lum1400.lt.1.5 ] ) .",
    "we now find mean values for @xmath36 of @xmath37 ( 18 msps ) and @xmath38 ( 55 normal pulsars ) .",
    "the corresponding medians are 0.1 ( msp ) and 0.5 ( normal ) , respectively . performing a kolmogorov - smirnov test on both samples , we find that both distributions are similar with a probability of 13% .",
    "it is interesting that besides a deviating mean value for the luminosity there seems to be a lack of highly luminous sources , i.e.  @xmath39 , found for msps relative to normal pulsars .",
    "this could be an artifact due to the smaller number of msps in our sample or perhaps due to a possible remaining small difference in the spectral distribution of both samples .",
    "however , relying completely on published flux densities we find a similar trend in the ( usually ) quoted 400-mhz luminosities .",
    "it therefore seems that , although normal pulsars and msps have fairly similar luminosity distributions , msps tend to be slightly weaker sources on the average . in order to verify this result",
    "we have performed the same analysis on nearby sources detected in the parkes survey .",
    "the derived values are @xmath40 and @xmath41 for the mean logarithm of @xmath31 of msps and normal pulsars , while we find medians of 0.1 ( msp ) and 0.6 ( normal ) , respectively .",
    "a ks - probability of only 4.8% is found that both distributions are drawn from the same parent distribution .",
    "summarising , we have indications that the luminosity distributions of both types of pulsars are slightly different .",
    "any difference in the emission properties of msps and normal pulsars could have its origin in the assumed special evolutionary history of msps or the significant difference in period and magnetic field ( see also paper ii ) .",
    "it is therefore interesting that although we have only seven ( out of nine ) isolated msps ( including the planetary system b1257 + 12 ) in our flux density sample , we can confirm the observation by bailes et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , that isolated msps tend to exhibit lower luminosities than binary msps .",
    "the mean value of @xmath42 for isolated msps is only @xmath43 and thus lower than that for the rest of the sample , @xmath44 . restricting the sample to those sources within a distance of 1.5 kpc",
    ", we still find a difference in the mean value for isolated msps ( @xmath45 ) and binary msps ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "in contrast , the mean spectral index for isolated msps appears to be the same as that for the whole sample , @xmath30 .",
    "investigating possible relationships of the spectral properties of msps to spin parameters like period , magnetic field , spin down luminosity ( @xmath47 ) or accelerating potential ( @xmath48 , e.g. ,  ruderman & sutherland 1975 ) , we could not find significant correlations . calculating these values",
    "we have used intrinsic period derivatives , i.e. ,  observed values of @xmath49 were corrected for kinematic effects whose importance for pulsars was first pointed out by shklovskii ( 1970 ) . as a result ,",
    "measured spin - down rates can be biased by proper motion and galactic acceleration ( see damour & taylor 1991 ) , which can become a significant effect for msps ( camilo , thorsett , & kulkarni  1994 ) . for those sources where no velocity information was available , after camilo et al .",
    "( 1994 ) we assumed a transverse speed of 75 km / s .",
    "we note in passing , that there might be a tendency for the spectral index of msps to correlate with the characteristic age of msps , i.e. ,  younger msps tend to have a steeper spectrum than older msps .",
    "we find that galactic disk msps with a characteristic age between @xmath7 yr and @xmath3 yr have a mean spectral index of @xmath50 , while those with a characteristic age between @xmath3 yr and @xmath51 yr exhibit a mean spectral index @xmath52 .",
    "msps with a characteristic age larger than @xmath51 yr in comparison show a mean index of @xmath53 .",
    "this trend would be in apparent contrast to that observed for normal pulsars",
    "( johnston et al .  1992 ; lorimer et al .",
    "as new sources are discovered , it will be interesting to see whether this tendency still holds .",
    "however , the lack of any significant correlation between spectral properties and observed spin parameters is similar to the observations made for normal pulsars assuming a canonical pulsar model ( malofeev 1996 ) .",
    "investigating the radio efficiency of msps and normal pulsars we have compared the ratio of spin down luminosity , @xmath54 erg / s where @xmath6 is measured in seconds ( e.g. ,  manchester & taylor 1977 ) , and observed radio luminosity .",
    "the distribution of the logarithm of this ratio , @xmath55 , expressed in units of mjy kpc@xmath32 erg@xmath56 s is presented in fig .",
    "[ efficiency ] for both msps and normal pulsars .",
    "again we have restricted both samples to sources closer than 1.5 kpc to remove the bias previously discussed .",
    "it is evident that msps are much less efficient radio pulsars than slow rotating ones .",
    "the mean value of @xmath57 found for msps and normal pulsars is @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively , while the mean value of @xmath60 itself is found to be @xmath61 ( msp ) and @xmath62 ( normal ) , respectively .",
    "in figs .  [ profa][profd ]",
    "we present a collection of 27 profiles of msps . they all represent averages of typically ten to twenty independent observations and were used as templates for timing purposes .",
    "most of the profiles are of unprecedented quality in signal - to - noise ratio and resolution .",
    "both are indicated by the small error box left of the pulse .",
    "the height of the box corresponds to one standard deviation ( rms ) measured in an off - pulse region while its width represents the resolution of the profile .",
    "the latter is determined by the dispersion smearing across one filterbank channel of 666 khz . only for b1744@xmath924a and b1937",
    "+ 21 is this dispersion smearing apparently large enough to smear out individual features of the pulse shape , also having a significant impact on the measured width of the profile presented in table  [ widths ] . for b1937 + 21",
    "we therefore present a pulse profile which was obtained with the ebpp , a coherent dispersion removal processor recently installed in effelsberg .",
    "details of this system are published elsewhere ( backer et al .",
    "for the other profiles presented the indicated effective resolution of the profile , also quoted in table  [ widths ] , is that imposed by interstellar dispersion , since we sampled each profile with a resolution of @xmath63 s which is generally smaller than the smearing time . in the few cases ,",
    "where sampling time and dispersion smearing become comparable , the effective resolution is the sum in quadrature of both .",
    "a detailed discussion of individual pulse profiles is presented in paper ii using their polarisation properties to gain further insight in the nature of the various components . in this paper",
    "we want to draw attention to a few particular sources where the quality of the profiles obtained is so good , that previously undetected profile features have been discovered or where previously known features are significantly better resolved in our observations .    as a first example we note",

    "[ blownup ] we also note the possible existence of a feature following the profile by about 80 .",
    "further observations are required to establish the existence of this post - cursor .",
    "while the existence of the pre - cursors of j2145@xmath90750 is well known ( lorimer 1994 ) , we can confirm the pre - cursor of b1953 + 29 first observed by thorsett & stinebring ( 1990 , cf .",

    "we finally draw the attention to j2317 + 1439 . for this pulsar",
    "we detect a prominent post - cursor , following the midpoint of the profile by about 70 but connected to the main profile by low level emission .",
    "additionally , we note the possible existence of a weak interpulse preceding the main pulse by about 150 .",
    "the complicated profiles of some of the first discovered msps ( e.g. ,  b1953 + 29 , b1957 + 20 ) created the impression that msp profiles are much more complex than those of normal pulsars which would be tempting to relate to the evolution history of msps by a possible disturbance of the magnetic field structure due to mass accretion ( ruderman 1991 ) .",
    "as now about 40 msps are known in the galactic plane , it seems adequate to re - examine this issue again in the light of a much larger sample presented here .    a measure of the complexity of pulse profiles is obviously given by the number of gaussian components needed to obtain a representation of the pulse profile .",

    "the sample of normal pulsars contains a large number of profiles with more than five components .",

    "this apparent characteristic of msps has been noted before in particular for the occurrence of interpulses , albeit in a much smaller sample ( ruderman 1991 ) .",
    "this is an important distinction between these two classes of objects , which also accounts for some of the difference in the complexity . in summary , we conclude that the difference in the complexity of pulse shapes of msps and normal pulsars is surprisingly small ( i.e. ,  only one gaussian component ) .",
    "simultaneously , we consider the peculiar large number of msp interpulses and pre / post - cursor as an important clue in deciphering the circumstances in their very compact magnetospheres ( cf .",

    "if the emission beam of radio pulsars is confined to the open field line region , simple scaling arguments based on the opening angle of the last open field lines ( goldreich & julian 1969 ) suggest that the radiation beam of msps should be larger than that of normal pulsars . as a first approximation for the size of the beam one can study the observed profile widths which are listed in table  [ widths ] for our sample of msps .",
    "these widths were obtained using the technique described by kramer et al .",

    "all widths and their corresponding uncertainty , which is mainly determined by the dispersion smearing , are quoted in both units of degrees of longitude and milliseconds . additionally , we used the value of @xmath66 to derive the duty cycle of the pulsed emission .",

    "however , the pulse width is only a poor estimator for the true size of the emission beam since it is significantly biased by the individual viewing geometry of each pulsar .",

    "here we just want to investigate whether this tendency is related to the assumed evolutionary history of msps .",
    "in such a case , the profiles could be affected by the amount of mass transferred from the binary companion since the transferred mass could have altered the dipolar magnetic field structure of the progenitor and thus the profile development compared to normal pulsars ( ruderman 1991 ) .    in order to quantify the profile development of msps we have used the results of the component separations ( see sect .  [ components ] ) to produce noise - free templates .",

    "profiles of b1937 + 21 were excluded since they are affected by interstellar scattering at low frequencies ( thorsett & stinebring 1990 ) .    since",
    "high - mass binary pulsars are expected to have accreted a smaller amount of mass than low - mass binary pulsars with large inferred amounts of accreted mass ( e.g. ,  phinney & kulkarni 1994 ) , we plotted @xmath96 versus the companion mass ( fig .  [ profevolv ] ) . in cases where the inclination of the binary system is not known",

    "we observe a slight tendency for systems with less massive companions to show more profile development with frequency than those with more massive companions .",

    "it can be expected that the final spin period of a recycled pulsar is related to the companion mass ( e.g. ,  van den heuvel & bitzaraki 1995 ) .",
    "studying @xmath96 as a function of pulse period we see , in fact , essentially the same tendency . distinguishing between sources with spin periods smaller and larger than 10 ms ( now also including isolated msps with reasonably resolved profiles ) , we find a mean @xmath96 of @xmath106 for @xmath107 ms ( 16 sources ) and @xmath108 for @xmath109 ms ( 8 sources ) .",

    "( 1997 ) , that binary msps are more luminous than isolated msps , while we show simultaneously that both groups exhibit the same mean spectral index .",
    "although we observe a weak tendency that the characteristic age is correlated with the spectral index of msps , no other significant correlation between spectral properties of msps and other system characteristics is apparent .    investigating the complexity of pulse profiles of normal pulsars and msps , we have demonstrated that , on average , msp profiles are only marginally more complex than those of normal pulsars .",
    "in fact , the intrinsic size of msp radiation beams is much smaller than expected from the scaling laws derived for normal pulsars .",
    "we observe the tendency that the profile development with frequency is related to the amount of mass transferred during the recycling process .",
    "the sample of sources presented in table  [ fluxtab ] misses only two galactic msps within a distance of 1.5 kpc , which have no published detection at 1400 mhz ( j0034@xmath90534 and j1455@xmath93330 ) .",
    "these non - detections suggest a steep spectrum for both sources which could lead to a slightly steeper mean spectral index for all msps .",
    "the same however applies also to our sample of normal pulsars where we also included only those sources which were previously detected at 1400 mhz .",
    "we therefore conclude that the comparison of both samples leads to reliable results .",
    "we note in passing that the mean spectral index of those four sources detected by kijak et al .",

    "the result that the spectra of normal pulsars and msps are essentially the same , strongly suggests the same emission mechanism for both types of pulsars , in spite of the difference in period by three orders of magnitude . if the magnetic field structure in the emission region is influencing the flux density spectrum , as in the case for curvature radiation , this result points also towards a dipolar field structure as found for normal pulsars .",
    "in such a case , the emission mechanism must also work over four orders of magnitude in magnetic field strength as inferred by the measured period derivatives .",
    "however , multipole components existing at the neutron star surface could increase the magnetic field strength over the value expected from a dipolar field structure ( see krolik 1991 ; arons 1993 ; paper ii ) . in any case",
    ", the weak tendency of a correlation between the spectral index and the characteristic age , which is in contrast to that observed for normal pulsars , suggests an evolution of the magnetospheric conditions .",
    "our observations show that msps tend to be less luminous than normal pulsars , while they are also less efficient radio emitters compared to normal pulsars . during the analysis leading to this result we used a luminosity estimator defined as the observed equivalent continuum flux density , i.e. ,  measured pulse energy , @xmath111 , averaged over the pulse period , @xmath112 , times the square of the distance ( cf .",
    "manchester & taylor 1977 ) .",
    "most of the distances used for both normal pulsars and msps are derived from dispersion measures using the model by taylor & cordes ( 1993 ) .",
    "the resulting values are therefore somewhat uncertain",
    ". however , our conclusions are based on samples of objects within 1.5 kpc distance , where the taylor & cordes ( 1993 ) model should be free of systematic trends .",
    "any remaining effect not accounted for in this model , would apply to both groups of objects , and thus would not change our result .",
    "actually , a more severe effect to be considered is the disadvantage of the luminosity estimator in that it reflects only the emission received by the cut of our line - of - sight rather than that from the full emission cone .",
    "the derived luminosity is thus also biased by the viewing geometry . in order to account for",
    "this effect one should make use of derived opening angles to use the true size of the emission beam in order to calculate the luminosity . for a comparison of sources we had to assume filled emission beams of circular shape .",
    "moreover , the opening angles can only be determined for a limited number of sources , so that we decided to use a second luminosity estimator based on the peak flux density , @xmath113 , which still depends on the viewing geometry but is less affected by the actual pulse shape and width .",
    "the previously used luminosity is defined as @xmath114(mjy)@xmath115(kpc@xmath32)@xmath116(mjy s)@xmath115(kpc@xmath32)@xmath117(s ) , which using the definition of the equivalent width becomes @xmath114(mjy)@xmath115(kpc@xmath32 ) @xmath118(mjy)@xmath119(kpc@xmath32)@xmath120 .",
    "we have thus computed the value @xmath121(mjy)@xmath115(kpc@xmath32 ) @xmath122(@xmath123 ) using the equivalent widths presented in table  [ fluxtab ] and those published by gould ( 1994 ) for normal pulsars . for normal pulsars within a distance of 1.5 kpc",
    "we find a mean value for @xmath124 at 1400 mhz of @xmath125 with a median of 2.07 .",
    "in contrast , for our sample of msps closer than 1.5 kpc we find a mean value for @xmath124 of @xmath126 with a median of 1.5 .",
    "the ks - probability that both distributions are drawn from the same parent distribution is only 1% , strengthening even further the conclusion that msps are less luminous than normal pulsars .",
    "it is interesting to note that msps seem also to be less efficient gamma - ray sources since from the six pulsars confirmed as egret sources , none is a msp ( kanbach et al .",
    "this fact is surprising since the mean value of @xmath127 for msps is more than one order of magnitude larger than that of normal pulsars ( cf .",
    "[ effval ] ) .",
    "moreover , most of the known msps are nearby sources due to the afore - mentioned selection effects , so that the ratio of @xmath127 and square of the distance , @xmath128 , apparently relevant for gamma - ray emission , is much larger for msps than for the average normal pulsar . one can speculate whether these observations for radio and gamma - ray emission are related since for both types of radiation , similar models are proposed , i.e. ,  polar cap and outer gaps models ( cf .",
    "paper ii ) .",
    "while the sample of slowly - rotating pulsars detected as gamma - ray sources is made up by relatively energetic pulsars , a difference in the particle density in the magnetosphere of normal pulsars and msps could explain the dissimilarity in their luminosity distribution .",
    "the fact that there is a difference in the radio luminosity distribution of binary and isolated msps strongly suggests that the luminosity of all msps is affected by their evolutionary history .",
    "it has been suggested that the overall dipolar field apparently observed for normal pulsars ( e.g. ,  phillips & wolszczan 1992 ; kramer et al .",
    "1997 ) could be distorted by the existence of magnetic multipoles in cases of msps which could be enhanced by mass accretion from a binary companion .",
    "disturbance of a dipolar field structure or the existence of magnetic multipoles in the emission region should be reflected by overall shape of pulse profiles , their frequency development , and in particular in the polarisation properties which are discussed in detail in paper ii .",
    "the previously observed apparent large complexity of msp profiles was attributed to a deviation of the magnetic field structure from a dipolar form ( krolik 1991 ) .",
    "however , we have demonstrated that the majority of msp profiles are actually only marginally more complex .",
    "since most of the profiles used to derive this result are in general of very high resolution already , we do not expect the observable complexity to change significantly even if a coherent de - dispersion technique is used ( cf .",
    "profile of b1937 + 21 and also backer 1995 ) .",
    "we believe that the impression created after the discovery of only a few msps , was mainly due to the much larger duty cycle seen ( see table  [ widths ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the average 3% found for normal pulsars ( taylor et al .",
    "1995 ) , we observe a mean duty cycle of 21% for msps .",
    "therefore , for msps one immediately observes a `` blown - up '' version of the pulse shape , enabling an easier identification of various components .",
    "zooming in on the profiles of normal pulsars as done by seiradakis et al .",
    "( 1995 ) or kijak et al .",
    "( 1997b ) , can lead to similar results for normal pulsars .",
    "therefore , the complexity of msp profiles alone does not obviously provide any clue as to whether higher order magnetic multipoles exist in the emission region .",
    "in fact , if the number of components is related to the size of the polar cap , one would expect a considerably larger number of components for msps even in cases of a dipolar field , since the polar cap scales as @xmath76 .",
    "this is however not the case .",
    "as already discussed , a perplexing large number of interpulses and pre-/post - cursors makes up for some of the one unit difference derived in the mean number of components of normal pulsars and msps .",
    "therefore , even if a dipolar field near the neutron star or in the emission region exists , the full open field line region might not be illuminated . in any case",
    ", the large number of additional pulse features appearing in addition to the main pulse is an important significant difference in the properties of msp and normal pulsar emission .",
    "combined with the relatively normal complexity of msp profiles , it possibly suggests that their origin is due to additional radiation beams , e.g. ,  due to outer gap emission ( e.g. ,  cheng et al .  1986 ) .",
    "we discuss this possibility further in paper ii .      by investigating the opening angles ,",
    "we have demonstrated that the radiation beams of msps are significantly smaller than expected .",
    "certainly , the opening angles based on a determination of the viewing geometry by studying polarisation data ( paper iii ) , involves the assumption of the validity of the rotating vector model for msp magnetospheres to derive @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "however , we have seen that the statistically derived opening angles imply the same result",
    ". the calculation of @xmath72 itself does not include any assumption about the magnetic field configuration .",
    "it is even independent of the actual shape of the beam , i.e. ,  whether it might be circular or elongated in either latitudinal or longitudinal direction .",
    "we suggest three reasons for the different behaviour of msps and normal pulsars .",
    "the beams might be intrinsically smaller ( i.e. ,  the open field line region is not completely filled by emission in contrast to normal pulsars ) , the emission height or a radius - to - frequency mapping might be different for normal pulsars and msps , or the field configuration in msps magnetosphere is indeed disturbed as compared to a dipolar field presumably dominant in normal pulsars .",
    "arons ( 1993 ) has used the observed spin - down rates to argue that magnetic multipoles are not prominent in msp magnetospheres .",
    "again , we focus on this issue in detail in paper ii , where for the first time a large homogeneous set of polarisation data is available to trace the magnetic field structure . here",
    "we draw attention to the fact that by assuming dipolar field lines , the derived opening angles lead to inconsistent results , i.e. ,  emission from _ inside _ the neutron star .",
    "this result is however partly based on the assumption of the correctness of the rotating - vector - model fits and a neutron star radius of 10 km . as only a ridiculously small neutron star radius of 1 km",
    "can solve this apparent contradiction , the reliability of the polarisation fits is discussed in paper iii .    for normal pulsars",
    "the observed data suggest that the emission height above the surface is a function of frequency , i.e. , high frequency emission is emitted closer to the neutron star than low frequency emission ( cordes 1978 ) .",
    "if such a model is also valid for msps , then the observed discrepancy between the opening angles of msps and normal pulsars could be explained by a different _ radius - to - frequency mapping _",
    "behaviour , i.e. ,  a different frequency dependence or a change in the absolute scale ( cf .",
    "eq .  [ rho0 ] ) . comparing the @xmath129-relations derived for normal pulsars at different frequencies ( rankin 1993a , b ; gil et al",
    ".  1993 ; gould 1994 ; kramer et al .  1994 ) , one notes only a very small difference in the scaling factor of the order of one degree of longitude .",
    "given the small frequency development of msp profiles ( cf .",
    "[ freqchange ] ) it becomes obvious that a different frequency scaling can not account for the apparent small beam sizes of msps .",
    "although the tendency that the profile development is related to spin period or the amount of mass transferred to the msp is far from being established , its confirmation would in fact suggest that a ( probably weak ) radius - to - frequency mapping is acting in a non - dipolar field structure . compared to a purely dipolar field , a small change in the emission altitude should have a larger impact in a disturbed magnetic field structure , causing a larger change in the profile with frequency .",
    "chen & ruderman ( 1993 ) argued that mass accretion would reduce the radius of the polar cap and thus the size of the open field line region .",
    "therefore , the recognised trend in the profile development might not only point towards the modification of a dipolar field structure by mass accretion , but could also offer an explanation for the smaller beam sizes . in any case , it seems necessary to include additional independent information to decide whether a multipole or disturbed dipolar magnetic field or systematically unfilled emission beams are present . a major step in this direction",
    "is taken in papers ii and iii , where we focus on the possible impact of gravitational bending and magnetic field sweep back .",
    "the latter effects are apparently not important for the emission of normal pulsars ( e.g. ,  phillips 1992 ; kramer et al .",
    "1997 ) , but they might become relevant if the emission simultaneously takes place close to the neutron star surface and at a significant fraction of the light cylinder radius as indicated by fig .",
    "[ rhofig ] .",
    "we have seen that normal pulsars and msps apparently differ in the luminosity distribution and the intrinsic size of their emission beam .",
    "both properties are important parameters for deriving the birth - rates of both groups of pulsars .    in general , one will assume as a first approach the same luminosity distributions for msps and normal pulsars",
    ". however , the observed difference in the mean value of the derived luminosity corresponds to a factor of about six and is therefore at a level to become important for birth - rate studies of msps .",
    "indeed , in a recent analysis , lyne et al .",
    "( 1998 ) find evidence for a difference in the luminosity function between normal pulsars and msps at low luminosities .",
    "similarly , one should reconsider the calculated birth - rates of msps under the impression that the scaling law for the beam size derived for normal pulsars does not apply to msps . assuming a random distribution of the inclination angle @xmath70 , the beaming fraction , @xmath130 describing the fraction of the sky covered by the radiation beam , is given by @xmath131 ( emmering & chevalier 1989 ) . if the beaming fraction is large , the chance of detecting a source is high , resulting in a smaller birth - rate necessary to sustain the observed population , compared to the case of a smaller beaming fraction .",
    "we have seen that if we apply the scaling law found for normal pulsars also to fast rotating pulsars , the beaming fraction should be very close to unity , i.e.  @xmath132 .",
    "in contrast , inspecting fig .",
    "[ rhofig ] , one might get an impression that @xmath133 represents a typical value for msps , corresponding to a beaming fraction of @xmath134 .",
    "an increase in the needed birth - rate can only be avoided if the radiation beam is not circular in shape , but actually elongated in latitudinal direction ( cf . chen & ruderman 1993 ) .",
    "the evidence for elongation of the beam is however weak , and while narayan & vivekanand ( 1983 ) have indeed suggested such a beam shape , biggs ( 1990 ) even argued for a compression of the beam in the latitudinal direction , depending on the inclination angle .",
    "the study of the characteristics of msp radio emission of which the present work is the first of a series of papers , was motivated by the question , in what respect do msps differ from normal pulsars .",
    "the fact that both populations exhibit identical flux density spectra points towards the same emission mechanism , which is further supported by the results presented in paper ii . at the same time , the radio output of msps seems to be affected by their particular evolutionary history , i.e. ,  the entire sample tends to be less luminous and in fact less efficient radio emitters compared to normal pulsars .",
    "it is particularly interesting that , compared to the luminosity distribution of normal pulsars within a distance of 1.5 kpc ( fig .",
    "[ lum1400.lt.1.5 ] ) , we are apparently missing some high luminosity msps , although they should be the easiest to detect .",
    "although no significant correlations between spectral parameters and intrinsic spin parameters are observed , we note a weak tendency for old msps to exhibit flatter spectra than msps with smaller intrinsic ages .",
    "although remarkable exceptions to the rule are observed , the pulse profiles of msps are only slightly more complex than for the normal pulsars .",
    "these profiles do not change significantly with frequency ( for a detailed discussion see paper ii ) , but we have indications that a measure of profile change is actually related to the amount of mass transferred onto the neutron star during a spin - up episode , or to the spin period .",
    "moreover , the angular beam radii inferred from the observed pulse shapes imply that the emission beam of rapidly - rotating pulsars is smaller than expected from our knowledge of normal pulsars .",
    "if the neutron star equation - of - state allows the existence of sub - millisecond pulsars , their detection will thus not be prevented by a beam size being too large as it would have been implied from simply scaling the trend seen in normal pulsars .",
    "the present data suggest that , although msps and normal pulsars exhibit the same emission physics , they show pronounced differences probably related to the different evolutionary history . in paper",
    "ii we elaborate on these aspects further and again raise the question about the origin of these differences in light of the additional data .",
