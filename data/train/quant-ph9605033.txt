    "phase transitions in anisotropic systems with cubic symmetry have attracted much interest in the literature @xcite-@xcite . especially well studied are corresponding models in quantum mechanics . to gain an analytic insight into the latter , banks , bender , and wu ( bbw ) @xcite studied a hamiltonian with a potential @xmath6.\\ ] ] using multidimensional wkb techniques they derived the large - order behavior of the perturbation series for the ground - state energy @xmath7 as a function of the anisotropy parameter @xmath3 .    in @xmath8 ,",
    "janke @xcite derived the same results with more efficiency from a path integral for the imaginary part of the energy @xmath9 .",
    "the imaginary part contains information on the tunneling decay rate of the ground state for @xmath10 , and determines directly the large - order behavior of the perturbation coefficients via a dispersion relation in the complex coupling constant plane . both , bbw and janke , find a different large - order behavior of the isotropic system @xmath1 and the anisotropic system @xmath11 .",
    "they do not discuss , however , the interesting question of how the latter goes over into the former as @xmath3 goes to zero .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to fill this gap . for an optimal understanding of the expected behavior we shall not attack directly the path integral involving the potential ( [ pot ] ) , but first only the corresponding simple integral .",
    "for this integral , a perturbation expansion of the form ( [ perturb ] ) yields exactly - determined @xmath3-dependent perturbation coefficients .",
    "the coeffients @xmath12 are shown to have a large - order behavior which undergoes a crossover between the earlier derived isotropic and anisotropic behaviors when the order @xmath4 passes the crossover value @xmath5 .",
    "the expansion terms of a model integral with the potential ( [ pot ] ) counts the number of terms in a perturbation expansion of the quantum mechanic and the field theory .",
    "thus the bare model integral is sufficient to derive nontrivial information on the large - order behavior of the eventual object of interest , quantum field theory .",
    "it turns out that for resumming the @xmath2-series , asymptotic large - order estimates for the @xmath3-dependent coefficients can be used only in the anisotropic regime @xmath13 . in the isotropic regime @xmath14 ,",
    "on the other hand , it is impossible to truncate the large - order expansion of the perturbation coefficients after a finite number of terms .",
    "thus the neighbourhood of the isotropic system @xmath1 needs an extra investigation . in the context of quantum field theory ,",
    "this was recently delivered in @xcite .",
    "the imaginary parts of physical quantities at small negative @xmath2 can be calculated with the help of classical solutions called instantons . in systems sufficiently close to the isotropic point",
    "it is not necessary to know the exact instanton solutions for all @xmath3 .",
    "the knowledge of the solution at the symmetry point @xmath1 is perfectly sufficient , around which the imaginary parts can be expanded in powers of @xmath3 .    after having understood the model integral",
    ", we shall perform the same analysis for an anisotropic quantum mechanical system , which represents an one - dimensional @xmath15-field theory with cubic anisotropy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in",
    "we develop a simple resummation procedure by which the divergent power series expansion of a function @xmath16 is converted into an almost convergent series @xmath17 . here @xmath18 are certain confluent hypergeometric functions which possess power series expansions in @xmath2 with similar large - order behavior as the system under study . in we shall analyse the above - mentioned crossover in the large - order behavior for the simple model integral .",
    "in particular , we shall justify the resummation procedure of and the methods in @xcite to be the perfect tools in approximating the integral for the region near the isotropic limit @xmath19 .",
    "in , finally , we present a similar calculation for the ground state energy of the anharmonic potential with cubic anisotropy .",
    "in addition to this more standard resummation procedure we analyse the model also within the variational perturbation theory developed in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "variational perturbation theory yields uniformily and exponentially fast converging expansion for quantum mechanical systems with quartic potentials @xcite .",
    "the uniform convergence was first proven for the partition function of the anharmonic integral , later for the quantum mechanical anharmonic oscillator with coupling strength @xmath2 in several papers @xcite .",
    "recently , the proof was sharpened and extended to the energies @xcite .",
    "the input for the quantum mechanical model is provided by the exact rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation coefficients of the ground - state energy which we derive from an extension of recursion relations first shown by bender and wu ( bw ) @xcite .",
    "we begin with developing a practical algorithm for a borel resummation of a divergent perturbation series @xmath20 our method will be most efficient under the following conditions :    1 .   from low - order perturbation theory",
    "we know the expansion coefficients @xmath21 up to a certain finite order @xmath22 .",
    "2 .   from semiclassical methods we are in the possession of the high - order information in the form",
    "@xmath23 3 .   by some scaling arguments we are able to assure a power behavior in the strong coupling limit @xmath24    the idea of",
    "the algorithm is the following : + it must be possible to construct an infinite , complete set of borel summable functions @xmath18 which satisfy the high - order and strong - coupling conditions ( [ res2 ] ) and ( [ res3 ] ) .",
    "these functions can be used as a new basis in which to reexpand @xmath25 : @xmath26 the series ( [ res4 ] ) should be such that the knowledge of the first @xmath27 coefficients in the power series expansion ( [ res1 ] ) is sufficient to determine directly the first @xmath27 coefficients @xmath28 , yielding an approximation @xmath29 this would then be a new representation of the function @xmath25 with the same power series up to @xmath30 but which makes use of large - order and strong - coupling informations ( [ res2 ] ) and ( [ res3 ] ) . in the limit of large @xmath22 ,",
    "the series ( [ res5 ] ) is expected to converge towards the exact solution .",
    "the functions @xmath18 being bore summable have a borel representation @xmath31 parametrized by some @xmath32 and integer @xmath33 , what are the conditions on @xmath34 , such that @xmath18 satisfies ( [ res2 ] ) and ( [ res3 ] ) for all @xmath33 ?",
    "the answer is most easily found with the help of the hypergeometric functions @xmath35 with appropriate parameters @xmath36 , @xmath37 apd @xmath38 .",
    "the pochhammer symbol @xmath39 stands short for @xmath40 .",
    "these functions have the following virtues : first , they are standard special functions of mathematical physics whose properties are well - known .",
    "second , they have a cut running from @xmath41 to minus infinity which is necessary to generate the large - order behavior ( [ res2 ] ) .",
    "third , they have enough free parameters to fit all input - data .",
    "the first property permits an immediate calculation of the borel integral ( [ res6 ] ) , which is simply a laplace transformation of @xmath42 @xmath43 the resulting @xmath44 is macrobert s @xmath9-function . using its asymptotic expansion ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , page 203 ) it is easy to verify that our ansatz reproduces the large - order behavior ( [ res2 ] ) . indeed , for large @xmath4 the power series @xmath45 has coefficients which grow like @xmath46 moreover , this property is unchanged if the original hypergeometric function is multiplied by a power @xmath47 .",
    "a possible set of borel functions are therefore the following functions : @xmath48 looking at ( [ res10 ] ) we see that the functions ( [ res11 ] ) are not completely fixed by a given large - order behavior .",
    "the parameter @xmath49 in ( [ res2 ] ) merely imposes the following relation upon the parameters @xmath50,@xmath51,@xmath52 and @xmath32 @xmath53 and there are many different ways to satisfy this .",
    "the specific choice will be suggested by practical considerations .",
    "one such consideration is that the @xmath54 s should possess a simple integral representation in order to avoid complicated numerical work .",
    "in addition , we would like to work with parameters @xmath50,@xmath51 and @xmath52 , for which the hypergeometric function @xmath55 reduces to simple algebraic functions .",
    "this happens only for special sets of the parameters .",
    "a simple possibility is for instance ( see ref .",

    "the equation ( [ res5 ] ) yields the condition @xmath59 on the functions @xmath60 . from ( [ res6 ] ) we see that such a power behavior emerges if all borel functions @xmath61 satisfy @xmath62 and thus @xmath63 [ see ( [ res11 ] ) ] .",
    "the explicit representation ( [ res13 ] ) shows that the parameter @xmath50 has to be taken as @xmath64 thus we obtain the approximation @xmath65 with @xmath66 where the borel parameter @xmath32 is fixed by ( [ res15 ] ) .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath67 in front of the expansion functions was introduced for convenience .",
    "let us now derive equations for the expansion coefficients @xmath28 in terms of the perturbation coefficients @xmath21 .",
    "all one has to do is take the asymptotic expansions @xmath68 insert these into ( [ res5 ] ) , collect terms of equal power @xmath69 , and compare these with the perturbation series ( [ res1 ] ) .",

    "this is possible using the following trick .",
