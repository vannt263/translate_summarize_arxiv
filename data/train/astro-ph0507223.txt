    "l +    jet production in x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) is strongly related to the properties of the accretion disc .",
    "recent works have established a link between the disc x - ray power and the jet radio power in black hole ( bh ) and neutron star ( ns ) xrb systems . in bh",
    "xrbs a non - linear correlation links the radio and the x - ray luminosity when in the hard state ( e.g. corbel et al . 2003 ; gallo , fender & pooley 2003 ) . accretion disc and jet theories can translate this coupling in to a relation between the power in the jet and mass accretion rate ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "heinz & sunyaev ( 2003 ) have derived a non - linear relation between the radio power of the jet observed at a given frequency , the mass of the compact object and the mass accretion rate . in the case of bhs ,",
    "it is common use to convert the ( bolometric ) x - ray luminosities in eddington units , and infer the mass accretion rate , that is the luminosity is a direct estimator of @xmath6 , although , as predicted already by e.g. the adaf model ( e.g. narayan & yi 1994 , 1995 ; narayan , garcia & mcclintock 1997 ) , observationally the relation between luminosity and other @xmath6 indicators is not straightforward [ homan et al . 2001 ; see also homan & belloni ( 2005 ) , remillard ( 2005 ) , mcclintock & remillard ( 2005 ) ] . in the case of nss ,",
    "the relation between the x - ray luminosity and other mass accretion rate indicators is definitely not one - to - one .",
    "parallel tracks are observed in ns xrbs , both for individual sources and across sources , between the centroid frequency of the khz quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) in the x - ray power spectra and the x - ray luminosity ( e.g. mndez et al .",
    "1999 ; ford et al .",
    "2000 ; van der klis 2001 ) .",
    "qpos are thought to be related to accretion disc properties , and in particular khz qpo frequencies are generally interpreted as being related to the motion of matter in the accretion disc at a preferential radius ( see e.g. van der klis 2004 for a review ) .",
    "this suggests that the khz qpos may be a more direct indicator , rather than luminosity , at least of accretion geometry ( see van der klis 2001 ) .",
    "many works showed that the characteristic frequency of the khz qpos are strongly related to the characteristic frequencies of the other timing features in the power spectra , so that lower - frequency qpos ( much easier to detect than the khz ones ) can be used as a proxy ( e.g. psaltis , belloni & van der klis 1999 ; belloni , psaltis & van der klis 2002 ; van straaten et al .",

    "we will discuss some implications of these results and suggest possible scenarios , which require testing using a larger sample .",
    "the phenomenon of the parallel tracks in the x - ray luminosity vs. khz qpo frequency plot for nss ( e.g. mndez et al .",
    "1999 ; see van der klis 2005 for a review ) may be explained using a single time dependent physical quantity , usually inferred as the mass accretion rate in the disc @xmath171 , if we consider the khz qpo frequency to be governed by the balance between this quantity and luminosity l@xmath172 , while the luminosity responds to both this quantity and its time - averaged variations ( van der klis 2001 ) .",
    "the qpos seem to be a good tracer of the disc geometry as determined by the balance between @xmath171 and l@xmath172 , in the regions very close to the compact object where also jets are thought to originate ( see also below ) .",
    "van der klis ( 2001 ) also suggested that one possible mechanism for balancing the energy budget is by removing material from the binary in the form of a mildly - relativistic jet , so that the accretion rate on to the compact object is no longer the same as the mass transfer rate through the disk .",
    "all the variability components in the power spectra follow a universal scheme , when plotted against the upper - khz qpo .",
    "therefore the disc geometry may be inferred also by low - frequency timing features .",
    "in particular in atoll sources , a tight correlation exists between the centroid frequency of the upper - khz qpo and that of ( the radio power tracer ) l@xmath111 : the best - fit power - law is @xmath173 ( van straaten , van der klis & mndez 2003 ) , or @xmath174 using @xmath117 ( van straaten , van der klis & wijnands 2005 ) .",
    "if we assume that @xmath175 is related to an orbit in the disc at an inner radius r@xmath176 , the fact that the radio jet power increases with @xmath10 , may be explained by a scenario in which the jet particles and magnetic field lines may be ` squeezed ' as the disc moves inwards .",
    "( the jet power possibly increases until the magnetic field lines of the jet interact with the magnetic field of the ns surface ; see also below in   [ discussion : ms ] ) .",
    "c +   +   +    the observations of the ms accreting x - ray pulsar igr  j00291 + 5934 , taken in the last part of the decay of the x - ray outburst on 2004 , also lies on the radio luminosity / x - ray timing frequency correlations of atoll sources ( adding this source the l@xmath143 and l@xmath142 rank correlations are significant to the 99.6% and 99.7% level , respectively ) . on contrary , the observations of sax  j1808.43658 seem to diverge from the radio / x - ray coupling found in atoll sources and igr  j00291 + 5934 , especially from the l@xmath142 relation ( see   [ results ] ; note that the ms x - ray pulsars are still consistent with the rank correlations between radio luminosity and the rms of the x - ray timing features of atolls sources ; see also fig .  3 , middle panel ) .",
    "the radio upper limit of sax  j1808.43658 has been derived on 1998 april 26 from an observation during the last part of the decay of an x - ray outburst , as for igr  j00291 + 5934 , and this value is also consistent with the correlations of the atolls .",
    "the observations that do not lie on the radio luminosity / x - ray timing frequency correlation are those of sax  j1808.43658 taken during the peak of the outburst in 2002 and the one that apparently re - flared on 1998 april 27 .",
    "although the lack of observations does not allow a complete understanding yet of the behaviour of the simultaneous radio / x - ray emission of ms x - ray pulsars throughout the evolution of an x - ray outburst , based on the present data we can start to make some remarks and speculations .",
    "focusing on the radio luminosity / x - ray timing frequency relations ( fig .",
    "[ ms ] , upper and lower panels ) we see that when the frequency is high ( @xmath177 ; @xmath178 ) the radio luminosity is below the one expected from atoll sources , while it is above during the re - flaring when the source show lower timing frequencies .",
    "furthermore , we see that in the 2002 outburst , in two days the timing frequencies change of a factor of four while only a little decrease is observed in radio luminosity , i.e. an increase in radio loudness .",
    "this may be an indication of an actual decoupling of disc and jet during the outburst , thus signature that a discrete jet has been launched .",
    "the fact that when the timing frequencies are higher the source is less radio loud than at lower timing frequencies , may be due to the relative importance of the magnetic field of the ns when the disc is getting closer to the ns during the outburst .",
    "for the two observations in 2002 we have a direct measurement of the upper khz qpos : l@xmath179  hz on october 16 and l@xmath180  hz on october 18 ( see also van straaten et al .",
    "if we relate this frequency to the keplerian orbit in the disc at a radius r@xmath176 , for a 1.4  m@xmath181 ns we derive r@xmath182  km in the october 16 observation and r@xmath183  km in the october 18 observation . for the observation of 1998",
    "april 27 , using the relation @xmath174 we derive r@xmath184  km . in ms accreting x - ray pulsars the magnetic field of the ns might be higher than in atoll nss ( e.g. chakrabarty 2005 ) , and for sax  j1808.43658 it has been estimated to be @xmath185  g ( psaltis & chakrabarty 1999 ) . the ( yet poor ) observations may suggest that below , say , @xmath186  km from the ns , the magnetic field , interacting more strongly with the regions of the disc where the jet is formed - closer to the compact object as the jet gets more powerful as suggested by the correlation with the x - ray timing frequencies - suppresses in some way the power of the jet ( possibly by interfering with a magnetic expulsion mechanism ; see also ",
    "[ discussion : atolls ] ) .",
    "we can have a rough estimate of the radius at which this happens if we assume that this interaction is strong when this region is close to the alfvn radius r@xmath187 .",
    "assuming for sax  j1808.43658 a magnetic field at the surface of @xmath188  g ( psaltis & chakrabarty 1999 ) , a luminosity during the decay of the 1998 outburst on april 27 of @xmath189  erg / s [ from gilvanov et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , using a distance of 2.5 kpc ( in t zand et al . 2001 ) ] , and a radius of the ns of @xmath190  km ( burderi & king 1998 ) , we obtain r@xmath191  km , and slightly smaller radii for the other observations ( see e.g. frank , king & raine 2002 and references therein ) .",
    "this radius is consistent with the inner radius we have estimated with khz qpos frequencies , therefore suggesting that the magnetic field of the ns , through its interaction with the innermost regions of the accretion disc , might play a role also in ( e.g. inhibiting ) the production of the jet .",
    "casella , belloni & stella ( 2005 ) found a clear association between a low - frequency qpo , the so - called type - c qpo in bhs ( e.g. wijnands et al .",
    "1999 ; remillard et al . 2002 ; casella et al . 2004 ) and the horizontal - branch oscillation ( hbo ) in z - type nss , suggesting a similar physical origin for these two timing features .",
    "van straaten et al . (",
    "2003 ) already compared the low - frequency features of atolls with those of z sources , and , based upon the correlation with the frequency of the khz qpos , identified the hbo in z sources with l@xmath111 in atoll sources .",
    "[ note that , a correlation between radio power and the position in the cd has been found in z sources , and it is precisely in the hb that z sources are more radio loud ( penninx et al .",

    "( 1999 ; see also fig .",

    "the fact that we find for these two features the same scaling with radio luminosity supports the idea that the same physics lie behind their origin .",
    "since all the compact jet models predict that the total jet power l@xmath192 and the power radiated in radio l@xmath140 are related as l@xmath193l@xmath194 ( e.g. blandford & konigl 1979 ; falcke & biermann 1996 ; falcke , markoff & fender 2001 ) , the finding that the radio luminosity scales with @xmath10 and @xmath195 , in nss and bhs respectively , with a slope of @xmath196 , would imply an almost linear correlation of l@xmath192 with these timing features .",
    "it is interesting to note that if we consider the frequencies of the timing components correlated with the radio luminosity ( i.e. @xmath10 for nss and @xmath72 for the bh gx  339 - 4 ) as originating from keplerian motion of matter in the disc , from the dynamical timescales observed we derive a distance to the compact object of @xmath197  r@xmath198 and 100 - 500  r@xmath198 ( where r@xmath199 is the schwarzschild radius ) , respectively in nss and in gx  339 - 4 .",
    "these radii are consistent with those derived from high - resolution radio imaging of the active galaxy m87 ( junor , biretta & livio 1999 ) and consistent with the idea that jets are formed very close to the compact object .",
    "the relations between the radio luminosity and the break frequency are even more intriguing , because such features have been observed also in agn ( e.g. mchardy et al . 2004 ) .",
    "therefore , these correlations , if further confirmed especially with a larger sample of bhs , open the possibility of the existence of a new ` fundamental plane ' for xrbs and agn ( merloni , heinz & di matteo 2003 ) , where the dimensions are the mass of the compact object , the radio luminosity and the characteristic frequency of a timing feature ( e.g. break ) , the last being , contrary to the x - ray luminosity ( see merloni et al . 2003 and falcke , krding , markoff 2004 ) , independent from the distance to the source .",
    "x - ray timing features can be the key features to finally find the common physical link between the accretion disc and the jet radio emission in nss and bhs of all masses .",
