    "galaxies in the local universe can be classified in two broad types , according to their structure or properties related to their star formation history .",
    "elliptical and s0 galaxies tend to be redder , to be bulge - dominated and show little star formation , being called early - type galaxies .",
    "spirals are bluer , show high star formation rate ( sfr ) and are termed late - type .",
    "the presence of these two main types have a strong correlation with environment , with the former being predominant in the most dense regions of the universe ( central parts of groups and clusters of galaxies ) , while the latter are more common in low - density environments , called field @xcite .",
    "those results can arise from differences in the intrinsic galaxy formation process ( galaxy properties also show strong dependence on stellar mass ) .",
    "another natural interpretation of this morphology - density relation is that galaxies are transformed as they move from the field to the central parts of clusters .",
    "several different processes acting within groups and clusters could be important for the transformation of late - type into early - type galaxies as they move from low to high density regions .",
    "these include ram - pressure stripping , strangulation , mergers and tidal stripping from the cluster potential @xcite .",
    "the open question regarding all these mechanisms is to know where they become relevant , as we consider infalling galaxies into groups or clusters .",
    "as these systems boundaries are hard to place it is nearly impossible to mark the transition between the field and groups / clusters .",
    "recent work has shown that the variation of galaxy types extend to very low density regions where the cluster influence should me minimal @xcite .",
    "these results became possible after the very large projects such as the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) and sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) became available . according to these works",
    "there is a critical density for which the connection between sfr and environment first takes place .",
    "as this critical density is compatible with regions outside the cluster virial radius , it is suggested that galaxies are first processed in groups @xcite . besides this pre - processing @xcite also suggests that _ overshooting _",
    "( @xcite ; another indirect mechanism ) is responsible for transforming galaxies , as well as ram pressure due to low density gas in the outskirts of clusters .    the morphology - density ( and color - density ) relation is known to have a strong dependence on mass , with red early - type objects being the most massive . that agrees with the scenario of hierarchical growth of structure , from which we expect the most massive halos to be in the most dense parts of the universe . as a consequence we expect the morphology - density relation to be a morphology - halo mass relation",
    "however , results in the literature are contradictory .",
    "for instance , @xcite and @xcite find no dependence on the fraction of early - type galaxies ( bulge - dominated and red galaxies ) , and properties of the cluster red - sequence ( rs ) , with parent halo mass . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite find a small dependence between morphology and halo mass .",
    "these differences may be associated to different halo mass ranges .",
    "the work of @xcite is based on a narrow cluster mass range ( @xmath7 ) , using simulated data , while the results of @xcite are restricted to clusters with @xmath8 km s@xmath9 .",
    "@xcite consider systems spanning a much wider mass range ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "another recent work @xcite based on even more massive systems than @xcite ( @xmath11 ; but a different lower mass cut ) find no significant variation of galaxy type fraction with halo mass .",
    "this work is the fourth of a series aiming to investigate cluster and galaxies properties at low redshifts ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "our main goal is to study galaxy properties in a variety of environments , from the central parts of groups / clusters to the field . for",
    "that we obtain the variation of the fractions of galaxy populations ( traced by different properties ) with local and global environment , characterized by the local galaxy density , distance to the center of the parent cluster , cluster mass ( traced by the velocity dispersion and x - ray luminosity ) and substructure . besides investigating the environmental variation of the galaxy populations we check its dependence on galaxy cluster mass .",
    "we also investigate the differences in the field and group / cluster galaxies and the transition between such populations .",
    "all the analysis is performed on two different luminosity ranges ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) , so that we can assess the impact of environment for giant and dwarf galaxies separately .",
    "the environmental influence is also investigated in different ranges of galaxy stellar mass .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : @xmath132 has the data description , where we also discuss the local galaxy density estimates , the field sample and the separation of the galaxy populations . in @xmath133",
    "we present the environmental variation of different galaxy populations according to different environment tracers .",
    "in @xmath134 we show how the relations between different galaxy properties depend on environment . in @xmath135",
    "we summarize and discuss our main results .",
    "the cosmology assumed in this work considers",
    "@xmath140.3 , @xmath150.7 , and h@xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 mpc@xmath9 , with @xmath17 set to 0.7 . for simplicity , in the following we are going to use the term `` cluster '' to refer loosely to groups and clusters of galaxies , except where explicitly mentioned .",
    "in the first paper of this series ( hereafter paper i , @xcite ) we defined a cluster sample from the supplemental version of the northern sky optical cluster survey ( nosocs , @xcite ) . for",
    "that we used data from the 5th sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) release .",
    "this sample comprises 7,414 systems well sampled in sdss dr5 ( details in paper i ) .",
    "nosocs has its origin on the digitized version of the second palomar observatory sky survey ( poss - ii ; dposs , @xcite ) . in @xcite and @xcite the photometric calibration and object classification for dposs , respectively ,",
    "are described .",
    "the supplemental version of nosocs @xcite goes deeper ( @xmath20 ) , but covers a smaller region than the main nosocs catalog @xcite .    for a subset of the 7,414 nosocs systems with sdss data we extracted a subsample of low redshift galaxy clusters ( @xmath1 )",
    "this subsample comprises 127 clusters , for which we had enough spectra in sdss for spectroscopic redshift determination , as well as to select cluster members and perform a virial analysis , obtaining estimates of velocity dispersion , physical radius and mass ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 ; details in paper i ) .",
    "this low - redshift sample was complemented with more massive systems from the cluster infall regions in sdss ( cirs ) sample ( @xcite , hereafter rd06 ) .",
    "cirs is a collection of @xmath1 x - ray selected clusters overlapping the sdss dr4 footprint .",
    "the same cluster parameters listed above were determined for these 56 cirs clusters .    in the second paper of this series ( hereafter paper ii , @xcite ) we investigated the scaling relations of clusters using this combined sample of 183 clusters at @xmath1 , except for three systems that are not used for having biased values of @xmath21 and mass due to projection effects .",
    "these 3 clusters are abell 1035b , abell 1291a , and abell 1291b .",
    "we plan to investigate the properties of these interacting clusters in detail in a future work .",
    "details about this low - redshift sample and the estimates obtained for the clusters can be found in papers i and ii .",
    "for the clusters with at least five galaxy members within r@xmath26 we also have a substructure estimate , based on the ds , or @xmath27 test @xcite .",
    "details about this test can be found in paper i.    the redshift limit of the sample ( @xmath28 ) is due to incompleteness in the sdss spectroscopic survey for higher redshifts , where galaxies fainter than @xmath29 are missed , biasing the dynamical analysis ( see discussion in section 4.3 of @xcite ) .",
    "we eliminated interlopers using the `` shifting gapper '' technique @xcite , applied to all galaxies with spectra available within a maximum aperture of 2.50 h@xmath9 mpc .",
    "we also estimated x - ray luminosity ( @xmath30 , using rosat all sky survey data ) , optical luminosity ( @xmath31 ) and richness ( n@xmath32 , @xcite ) .",
    "the centroid of each nosocs cluster is a luminosity weighted estimate , which correlates well with the x - ray peak ( see @xcite ) .    in @xcite ( hereafter paper iii )",
    "we investigated the connection between galaxy evolution and the dynamical state of galaxy clusters , indicated by their velocity distributions .",
    "here we focus on the investigation of the variation of galaxy properties ( and their relations ) , such as color , spectral class , stellar mass , and concentration , with the environment .",
    "note that we only use galaxies that are selected as cluster members by the `` shifting gapper '' technique .",
    "for the current work , we have also implemented one modification to the `` shifting gapper '' technique , regarding the radial offset between two consecutive galaxies . in previous papers of this series , if this quantity was greater than 1.0 mpc the `` shifting gapper '' procedure was stopped .",
    "then , all galaxies with a radial distance from the cluster centre greater or equal to this galaxy s radial distance were eliminated as interlopers ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this maximum offset between consecutive galaxies is now set to be 0.75 @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the biweight estimate of the typical separation of the inner galaxies ( within 0.50 h@xmath9 mpc ) .",
    "this modification was motivated by the fact that for a few systems the total number of members ( n@xmath35 ) was much larger than the number of members within r@xmath26 ( n@xmath36 ) .",
    "these were small mass groups that have a large cluster nearby ( after @xmath37 2.0 mpc ) . with the new version of this code some lower",
    "mass systems end up not having a minimum of ten group members selected to run the virial analysis .",
    "due to that our sample is reduced from 180 groups and clusters to 152 , for which we have 6,415 galaxies , being 5,106 with @xmath2 ( from clusters at @xmath1 ) and 1,309 galaxies with @xmath3 ( from objects at @xmath4 ) .",
    "our clusters span the range",
    "@xmath38 km s@xmath9 , or the equivalently in terms of mass , @xmath39 .      when comparing literature results regarding the environmental dependence of galaxy properties one central issue is the definition of environment",
    ". that can be local ( associated to the galaxy neighborhood ) or global ( related to the large scale structure ) .",
    "the galaxy environment measure is further complicated by different selection criteria , issues related to the survey geometry , as well as luminosity limits .",
    "@xcite investigate the impact of group environment on different scales , concluding that not only the surrounding density matters .",
    "@xcite present a multiscale model - independent approach to measure the galaxy density .",
    "their method is used to investigate the variation of the galaxy ( @xmath40 ) color distribution ( with -21.5 @xmath41 -20 ) on multiscale density .",
    "@xcite compare the results from twenty different published environment definitions .",
    "they classify the methods to measure environment in two groups , those based on nearest neighbours and those using fixed apertures .",
    "they conclude that the local environment is best probed by nearest neighbours methods , while the large - scale environment is best measured by apertures .",
    "considering the results from @xcite we decide to adopt a nearest neighbour method to estimate the local environment .",
    "the authors also mention that the choice of @xmath42 - the rank of the density - defining neighbour - is very important , as the environment measure may loose power in the case @xmath42 is larger than the number of galaxies residing in the halo . hence , we chose to work with the @xmath43 local galaxy density estimator , as @xmath44 is typically smaller than the number of galaxies we have per cluster and is a common estimate in the literature . to estimate local galaxy densities we proceed as follows .",
    "for every galaxy member we compute its projected distance , d@xmath45 , to the 5th nearest galaxy found around it , within a maximum velocity offset of 1000 @xmath46 @xmath19 ( relative to the velocity of the galaxy in question ) .",
    "the local density @xmath43 is simply given by 5/@xmath47d@xmath48 , and is measured in units of galaxies / mpc@xmath49 .",
    "density estimates are also obtained relatively only to galaxies brighter than a fixed luminosity range , which we adopt as @xmath50 . on what regards the global environment we consider the distance to the center of the parent cluster and its mass ( traced by the x - ray luminosity and velocity dispersion ) .",
    "we also inspect possible differences relative to the dynamical state of clusters , indicated by the substructure estimate .",
    "the fiber collision issue affects the sdss spectroscopic sample and the derived density estimates . due to a mechanical restriction spectroscopic fibers",
    "can not be placed closer than 55 arcsecs on the sky .",
    "an algorithm used for target selection randomly chooses which galaxy gets a fiber , in case of a conflict @xcite .",
    "this problem is reduced by spectroscopic plate overlaps , but fiber collisions still lead to a @xmath37 6% incompleteness in the main galaxy sample .",
    "our approach to fix this problem is similar to the one adopted by @xcite and @xcite . for galaxies brighter than @xmath51 18 with no redshifts we assume the redshift of the nearest neighbour on the sky ( generally the galaxy it collided with ) .",
    "this may result in some nearby galaxies to be placed at high redshift , artificially increasing their estimated luminosities .",
    "due to that the collided galaxies also assume the magnitudes of their nearest neighbours , resulting in an unbiased luminosity distribution .",
    "notice that the fraction of fixed galaxies is quite small ( at most @xmath52 , at highest densities ) ; the above correction procedure has been shown to accurately match the multiplicity function of groups in mock catalogues @xcite ; and the velocity distribution ( relative to group centre ) of the original and fixed samples are consistent @xcite .",
    "hence , the local galaxy density estimates take in account the fiber collision issue . for every galaxy we want to estimate density , either group member or belonging to the field ( see next section ) in the original spectroscopic sample , we use the fixed sample to find d@xmath45 and estimate @xmath43 .",
    "besides computing local galaxy densities to group / cluster members we also do that for a galaxy field sample .",
    "this sample is constructed as follows . from the whole dr7 data set we select galaxies that would not be associated to a group or cluster , considering the cluster catalog from @xcite . to be conservative , we consider a galaxy to belong to the _ field _ if it is not found within 4.0 mpc and not having a redshift offset smaller than 0.06 of any cluster from @xcite .",
    "we select more than 60,000 field galaxies , but work with a smaller subset ( randomly chosen ) for which we derived local density estimates . in the end we use 2,986 field galaxies at @xmath53 0.100 with @xmath2 , and 1,829 at @xmath53 0.045 with @xmath3 ( the same order of cluster galaxies ) . for these objects",
    "we compute density estimates in the same way as done for the cluster members .",
    "for the current work we consider the stacked properties of cluster and field galaxies ( in this case , regarding local density only ) .",
    "we do that considering the radial offset ( in units of @xmath23 ) , absolute magnitudes , colors and local densities of all member galaxies coming from the 152 clusters ( or the field ) .",
    "our sample consists of 5,106 bright member galaxies with @xmath2 ( at @xmath1 ) , 1,309 faint members with @xmath3 ( at @xmath4 ) , 2,986 bright field galaxies ( @xmath2 , @xmath1 ) and 1,829 faint field galaxies ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) .    to compute the absolute magnitudes of each galaxy ( in @xmath54 bands )",
    "we consider the following formula : @xmath55 ( @xmath56 is one of the four sdss bands we considered ) , where dm is the distance modulus ( considering the redshift of each galaxy ) , @xmath57 is the k@xmath58correction and @xmath59 ( @xmath60 , @xcite ) is a mild evolutionary correction applied to the magnitudes ( for each galaxy redshift ) . the k@xmath58corrections are obtained directly from the sdss database , for every object in each band .",
    "rest - frame colors are also obtained for all objects .",
    "galaxies can generally be separated in two groups according to their structure and star formation activity .",
    "early - type ( e and s0 ) galaxies are redder , have little star formation and high concentration , while late - type galaxies are bluer , show active star formation and are less concentrated . here",
    "we use three galaxy parameters to separate galaxies in two populations and investigate the variation of the fraction of each population ( specified by each of the three parameters ) with environment .",
    "we use the ( @xmath40 ) color , the concentration index @xmath61 ( defined as the ratio of the radii enclosing 90 per cent and 50 per cent of the galaxy light in the r - band , @xmath62 ) and a spectral classification called @xmath63 ( which is based on a pca analysis of the sdss spectrum database ) .",
    "we call blue / red galaxies those with ( @xmath40 ) values smaller / greater than 2.2 @xcite .",

    "we consider @xmath66 for concordance with the literature ( actually some authors even consider higher values of @xmath61 ) .",
    "note also that we show only galaxies in cluster regions and not from the whole sky ; and concentration does not provide a sharp cut as color or @xmath63 .",
    "our choice @xmath66 provides a good compromise between completeness and concentration of the two broad populations ( early and late type galaxies ) .",

    "[ fig : denbins ] we show how the fractions of blue ( @xmath74 ) , high @xmath63 ( or star - forming , @xmath75 ) , and low concentration ( or disc - dominated , @xmath72 ) galaxies depend on local galaxy density ( @xmath43 ) , for the bright regime ( @xmath2 ) .",

    "these fractions grow continuously to the lower density regime .",
    "however , the pace is reduced when we leave clusters and reach the field for bright galaxies , while for faint objects the fractions actually become approximately constant . for instance , for bright objects we have @xmath76 and @xmath77 at the highest and lowest density bins , for cluster members , respectively . for field galaxies",
    "we go from @xmath78 to @xmath79 from the highest to lowest density bins . for bright cluster members we still have @xmath80 and @xmath81 , and @xmath82 and @xmath83 , in the highest and lowest density bins , respectively .",
    "the equivalent fractions to field galaxies are @xmath84 and @xmath85 , and @xmath86 and @xmath87 . the fact that the variation with density still holds to the lowest density bins in the field , for bright galaxies , indicates that other factors not directly related to clusters may act to affect these galaxies ( such as tidal effects from neighbour galaxies ) .",
    "note that in the transition between clusters and the field we might have some contamination on both sides ; _ i.e. _ , field galaxies that are erroneously classified as cluster members and possibly cluster galaxies that are wrongly called field objects ( the former would belong to systems not listed in @xcite ) .",
    "however , we do not expect these contaminations to be high as the `` shifting gapper '' technique @xcite was extensively tested elsewhere ( with its member list being well compared to other methods ; see @xcite ) ; and the cluster catalog of @xcite is complete for rich systems in the local universe .",
    "so , the expected smooth transition from clusters to the field is not affected in our results .    for bright galaxies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : denbins ] ) we can see that the highest density field galaxies show larger fractions ( @xmath71 and @xmath72 ) than cluster galaxies at similar density , indicating that even the cluster low density environment plays a role on further diminishing the fraction of blue and star - forming bright galaxies @xcite . for faint objects ( fig .",

    "three other interesting features stand out in fig .",
    "[ fig : denbins2 ] .",
    "first , there is nearly no environmental variation for faint field objects , except for the most dense bin .",

    "second , the environmental variation is present in all bins for cluster members ( red open circles ) ; indicating the effectiveness of the cluster environment even in the outskirts .",

    "[ fig : denbins ] .",
    "@xmath74 and @xmath75 show very similar behavior to each other , while @xmath72 is generally higher , especially for cluster objects .",
    "that goes in line with other results in the literature suggesting that color and star - formation are affected much faster than structural parameters @xcite .     and @xmath72 with local galaxy density ( @xmath43 ) .",

    "for bright galaxies , in the most central bin we have almost no blue and high @xmath63 ( @xmath93 ) galaxies , but the fraction of low @xmath61 objects is @xmath94 .",
    "@xmath74 and @xmath75 grow to @xmath95 to roughly the virial radius ( approximated by @xmath23 ) . outside the virial radius",
    "they grow to @xmath88 , remaining nearly constant after that .",
    "@xmath72 grows to @xmath96 at @xmath97 , being @xmath98 for larger radii .",
    "in other words , the population of bright galaxies do not change significantly for objects falling into a cluster until they are within its virial radius . within the cluster",
    "the population changes faster when in the core ( @xmath92 ) . that indicates the tidal effects ( due to the cluster potential ) and the interaction to the icm ( denser within @xmath23 ) are very effective on transforming the galaxy populations , which would also lead to the so called anemic spirals @xcite .",
    "a similar trend is seen for faint galaxies , but different regimes may take place . from large to small radius it seems that @xmath71 and @xmath72 are roughly constant until @xmath99 ( @xmath100 for @xmath74 ) , falling to a lower plateau between @xmath99 and @xmath91 ( @xmath101 for @xmath74 ) and showing a steep decline until @xmath102 ( @xmath74 decreases to @xmath103 ) . in the very central region ( within @xmath102 ) there is a slight rise in the values of @xmath71 and @xmath72 before reaching the minimum value in the most central bin .",
    "if that rise in the central part is real it is probably associated to the formation of small galaxies in the core of clusters , from tidal debris or due to ram pressure stripping of larger galaxies @xcite .",
    "the variation in the four regimes mentioned above for @xmath75 and @xmath72 is similar to @xmath74 , being slightly noisier for @xmath72 .    against local density",
    "@xmath71 have a minimum at @xmath89 and @xmath88 for bright and faint objects , respectively ( the corresponding values are @xmath88 and @xmath83 for @xmath72 ) .",

    "one final result regarding radius deserves our attention .",
    "as seen in @xcite the variation of galaxy types reach far distances from the cluster centers . here",

    "hence , in agreement to @xcite , our results point to a scenario on which local density is the main driver for galaxy evolution and not the parent halo mass .",
    "this evolution happens as pre - processing in the group scale with star formation quenching and , to a lesser extent , morphological transformation .",
    "however , the second effect takes longer for being effective ( @xmath158 ) and shows a small segregation between groups and clusters in their central regions ( most dense in the universe ) ; as @xmath72 is slightly higher for groups than for high mass clusters . that can be seen from figures  [ fig : lxbins ] ,  [ fig : lxbins2 ] and  [ fig : vdispbins ] ( so , both as a function of density and radius ) .",
    "what we see in the current work does not contradict @xcite or @xcite .",

    "@xcite work with high mass clusters , consider the most central region ( @xmath151 ) only and are restricted to red sequence galaxies , while we consider a broader mass range and a larger region around clusters .    the pre - processing in groups can be explained by different mechanisms , such as mergers , strangulation and ram pressure , that can accelerate star formation , remove the gas reservoir and destroy galactic discs @xcite .",

    "are less probable , but galaxies may still be transformed due to the cumulative effects of successive weak encounters , tidal stripping by the cluster gravitational potential and interaction with the denser icm .    the smooth transition between cluster and field , seen in figures  [ fig : denbins ] and  [ fig : denbins2 ] , indicate that although cluster edges are hard to define , density is indeed a key parameter for galaxy transformation . for bright galaxies ( figure  [ fig : denbins ] ) the larger fractions for the highest density bin of field galaxies ( compared to cluster galaxies at similar densities ) indicate the significance of cluster environment related effects even in their outskirts @xcite . for bright field galaxies density",
    "is a key parameter for their evolution ( although we can not discard or distinguish internal feedback process ) .",
    "that is not true for faint field objects ( figure  [ fig : denbins2 ] ) , as low luminosity field galaxies are almost independent of environment . for cluster members",
    "the dependence on local density is very strong , both for bright and faint galaxies . considering galaxy stellar mass ( figures  [ fig : den_stmassbins ] and  [ fig : rad_stmassbins ] ) we find the largest fractions of blue , star - forming and discs for lower mass galaxies .",
    "environment is not relevant for these objects until they are in regions with local density typical of cluster outskirts .",
    "the environmental influence becomes stronger for higher densities for these low mass galaxies . on the contrary ,",
    "the most massive galaxies show small values of @xmath71 and @xmath72 , as well as a smaller variation with density and cluster radius .    comparing figures  [ fig : denbins ] and  [ fig :",
    "radbins ] we see that bright cluster galaxies outside @xmath23 have local densities of about 2 galaxies mpc@xmath136 . in other words , outside the virial radius the local density drops very fast , which explains in part the strong transition we see once galaxies are within this radius . within the virial radius",
    "another transition is seen in the inner parts , indicating that cluster related processes ( tidal effects and ram pressure ) further influence the galaxy populations . for faint galaxies , another characteristic region",
    "is still seen at @xmath159 . using detailed simulations @xcite could investigate which processes are most common at these regions .",
    "they found that at @xmath160 _ overshooting _ and pre - processing by groups explain the cold gas and star formation radial trends . but to larger radius ( reaching @xmath161 ) those two process can not fully explain the hot gas radial trends , so that ram pressure is also relevant .",
    "their results indicate that at large radius the ram pressure due to the icm can strip the hot gas haloes both for low and high mass galaxies .",
    "the cold gas can be stripped only within @xmath91 .",
    "@xcite show that even in low density regions the division of galaxy populations in two broad families is valid .",
    "we corroborate these results here , inspecting galaxies at different densities , but we also split them in cluster members and field galaxies .",
    "even for the latter this division is still valid .",
    "when moving to higher densities we can see the red , early - type sequence is well established with a few transition galaxies still being noticed , such as bulges classified as star - forming ( or blue ) .",
    "that is also seen as function of cluster radius , with the red sequence becoming narrower from the outer to inner regions of clusters . in agreement",
    "to @xcite we find that cluster mass is not a key parameter for establishing the red sequence .",
    "but we find evidence that for high mass systems the red sequence show a reduced scatter compared to small groups .",
    "that result indicates that star formation is shut down and galaxies reach the red sequence already in the group scale , but the job is finished in higher mass systems , when the red sequence becomes tighter .",
    "note again that @xcite is restricted to the central region and , most important , to higher mass clusters .",
    "hence , our main results point to the variation of galaxy populations from very low to the most dense regions of the universe , with a stronger variation after galaxies become part of groups / clusters ( being found within @xmath23 ) . the picture that comes out favors a pre - processing in the group scale , affecting first the star - formation and in a second stage galaxy structure .",
    "our results indicate that local density is the main driver for galaxy evolution .",
    "the parent halo mass may be relevant only to the most central regions .",
    "however , that is a controversial issue in the literature , possibly due to selection effects of the samples considered . in agreement with @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we also find an environmental dependence out to very large radius , corroborating the idea that pre - processing by groups and _ overshooting _ act to transform galaxy properties .",
    "the possible effect of ram pressure at large radius can only be tested using high resolution numerical simulations , as seen in the work of @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , our main findings are in good agreement to what is found in semi - analytic models .",
