    "ii , the nonelastic processes of electron - phonon collisions and also the elastic electron - electron scattering respect the inequality @xmath54 .",
    "one may hope , however , that some fine properties of real metal bodies could result in the violation of this inequality at some sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "it has been proposed @xcite that this role can be played by impurities and defects which lead to a nonzero residual value of the static resistivity ( and , thus , a relaxation parameter ; recall that resistivity is proportional to the relaxation parameter @xcite ) as the temperature goes to zero ( see also appendix d in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "here we adduce the argument that impurities can not remedy the situation with the violation of the nernst heat theorem .",

    "( [ eq19 ] ) break down and the casimir entropy rapidly takes a sharp upward turn to zero .",
    "we would like to point out also that the usual theory of the electron - phonon interaction , describing electrons interacting with elementary excitations of a perfect lattice with no impurities , must satisfy and does satisfy all the requirements of thermodynamics .",
    "in fact , the mean free path of the electrons between the collisions with impurities at zero temperature is many orders of magnitude greater than the penetration depth of the electromagnetic oscillations at the characteristic frequency into the metal . to make sure that this is the case , recall that the relaxation time for au ( the inverse of the relaxation parameter ) at @xmath34k is equal to @xmath116s . using the above resistivity ratio ,",
    "one obtains the value of the relaxation time at zero temperature @xmath117s .",
    "finally , using the value of fermi velocity for au ( @xmath118 m/s ) the mean free path of the electron is equal to @xmath119 cm .",
    "this should be compared with the thickness of the skin layer in the region of the infrared optics , equal to approximately 22 nm .",
    "that is why the attempt to remedy the violation of the nernst heat theorem at the expense of impurities is meaningless .",
    "recently the resolution of these complicated problems was obtained @xcite using another approach to the description of real metals based on the concept of the leontovich impedance boundary conditions .",
    "this approach offers a fundamental understanding of the reason why the drude model is not compatible with the theory of the thermal casimir force between real metals .",
    "the main concept of the lifshitz theory is the fluctuating electromagnetic field considered on the background of dielectric permittivity depending only on frequency .",
    "this concept works good in the case of dielectrics but is not adequate for real metals .",
    "in fact , in the frequency region of the anomalous skin effect the spatial non - uniformity of the field makes impossible a description of a metal in terms of @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "then the electromagnetic fluctuations also can not be considered on this background . moreover , in the frequency region of the normal skin effect the electric field @xmath120 initiates a real current of conduction electrons @xmath121@xmath122@xmath120 , where @xmath123 is the dc conductivity of a metal .",
    "these @xmath121 and @xmath120 should be considered as real ones @xcite .",

    "because of this , the concept of the electromagnetic fluctuations inside a metal remains unclear . in the absence of a complete theory we should not take into consideration the metal interior , but rather take into account the realistic material properties by means of the surface impedance function .",
    "it is well known that for a plane wave of a single frequency inside a medium with dielectric permittivity @xmath124 the following equations are valid @xcite @xmath125 where @xmath126 is a complex wave vector . then from the first equality of eq .",

    "it is significant that the surface impedance and the boundary conditions ( [ eq26 ] ) still hold , even in the frequency domain of the anomalous skin effect when , due to the spatial non - uniformity of the field , the description in terms of @xmath124 becomes impossible .",

    "an important point is that different representations for the impedances , which are equivalent for real photons , become nonequivalent in application to the fluctuation fields . as we have shown above , in the case of fluctuating fields the representation ( [ eq25 ] ) for the impedance",
    "should be used leading to the leontovich boundary conditions , whereas the representations ( [ eq23 ] ) , ( [ eq24 ] ) , when applied to virtual photons , lead to the contradictions with thermodynamics .    in the framework of the impedance approach the value of the zero - frequency term of the lifshitz formula",
    "is prescribed by the form of the impedance and quite satisfactory physical results are obtained . in particular , the casimir energy and force turn out to be monotonous functions of the temperature , in agreement with what would be expected from thermodynamics . in the region of the infrared optics",
    "the results obtained by using the surface impedance coincide with those found earlier through the use of the plasma dielectric function @xcite .",
    "the casimir entropy in the impedance approach is always positive and vanishes at zero temperature , in accordance with the nernst heat theorem .    to conclude ,",
    "we have proved that the drude dielectric function is not appropriate to describe the thermal casimir effect in the case of real metals , leading to contradictions with thermodynamics . on the other hand ,",
