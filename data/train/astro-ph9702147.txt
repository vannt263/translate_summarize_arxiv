    "astronomers have sought for two decades for dynamical evidence for the presence of massive black holes in galaxies by studying the dynamics of gas and stars in their nuclei .",
    "rapid motions provide the main signature of a black hole .",
    "if these are indeed observed , the main difficulty is to rule out alternative interpretations .",
    "gas motions can be due to hydrodynamical processes ( inflow , outflow , turbulence , etc . ) in addition to gravity .",
    "large stellar velocities in galactic nuclei can be the result of an overabundance of stars on radial orbits .",
    "the primary observational tool to discriminate between different models is to obtain data of the highest possible spatial resolution .    in recent years",
    "much progress has been made in all areas of this field . for active galaxies ,",
    "the existence of a central dark mass in at least some galaxies is now well established .",
    "the rotation velocities of nuclear gas disks detected with the hst can be used to study the central mass distribution .",
    "this has yielded evidence for a central dark mass of @xmath9 in m87 ( ford 1994 ; harms 1994 ) , and of @xmath10 in ngc 4261 ( ferrarese , ford & jaffe 1996 ) .",
    "even higher spatial resolution vlba radio observations of water masers in the nucleus of the active galaxy ngc 4258 ( miyoshi 1995 ) have revealed a torus in keplerian rotation around a dark mass of @xmath11 .",
    "for the case of ngc 4258 , there are strong theoretical arguments that this mass is indeed a black hole ( maoz 1995 ) .",
    "the density of quasars at high redshifts suggests that many currently normal galaxies had an active phase in the past ( chokshi & turner 1992 ; haehnelt & rees 1993 ) .",
    "hence , black holes are believed to be common in quiescent galaxies as well . in these galaxies only stellar kinematics are generally available to study the nuclear mass distribution .",
    "the evidence for a black hole in our own galaxy is now very strong , due to proper motion measurements for individual stars near sgr  a@xmath12 ( eckart & genzel 1996 , 1997 ) . for a handful of other , nearby galaxies , evidence for a central dark mass",
    "was obtained from ground - based measurements of line - of - sight velocities ( see kormendy & richstone 1995 for a review ) , but it remained difficult to rule out all alternative models .",
    "it was always foreseen to be a main task for the hst to improve the evidence , by providing spectra of superior spatial resolution .",
    "stellar kinematical studies with hst became possible after the refurbishment mission in 1993 .",
    "the first results were presented by kormendy ( 1996a , b ) , for ngc 3115 and ngc 4594 .",
    "spectra near the nucleus with @xmath13 resolution confirmed previous arguments for black holes of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the quiescent e3 galaxy m32 has long been one of the best - studied black hole candidate galaxies .",
    "the presence of a central dark mass of @xmath16@xmath17 has been argued on the basis of ground - based data with continuously increasing spatial resolution .",
    "the most recent work indicates a central dark mass of @xmath18@xmath19 ( van der marel et al .",
    "1994b ; qian et al .",
    "1995 ; dehnen 1995 ; bender , kormendy & dehnen 1996 ) . however , the best ground - based kinematical data still have a spatial resolution of ` only ' @xmath20 .",
    "goodman & lee ( 1989 ) showed that this is insufficient to rule out a cluster of dark objects , as opposed to a central black hole , on the basis of theoretical arguments .",
    "in addition , none of the previous dynamical studies has considered axisymmetric stellar dynamical models with fully general phase - space distribution functions .",
    "hence , it has not been shown convincingly that no plausible model can be constructed that fits the data without requiring a central dark mass .",
    "higher spatial resolution data are therefore highly desirable .",
    "this paper is part of a series in which we present the first hst spectra and new dynamical models for m32 .",
    "we obtained spectra of the nuclear region with the hst / fos , and we give here a detailed description of the acquisition and analysis of these data .",
    "dynamical models are presented in van der marel ( 1997b ) and cretton ( 1997 ) .",
    "the main results of the project are summarized and discussed in van der marel ( 1997a ) .",
    "the instrumental resolution of the fos has a gaussian dispersion of @xmath21 , while the wavelength scale can vary at the @xmath22 level from orbit to orbit .",
    "a study of a low mass galaxy such as m32 ( the main body of which has a velocity dispersion of @xmath23 and a rotation velocity amplitude of @xmath24 ) is therefore significantly more complicated observationally , than that of more massive galaxies ( which have higher dispersions ) .",
    "an additional complication is that the ` sphere of influence ' of the suspected black hole in m32 is smaller than that of most other candidate galaxies .",
    "it is thus necessary to use the smallest fos apertures , for which it is more difficult to do an accurate target acquisition .",
    "in addition , for a proper interpretation of the results it is necessary to determine the aperture position for each observation _ post facto _ , with an accuracy of @xmath25 . to deal with these complications it proved necessary to study the instrument and analyze the data in more than the usual detail .",
    "parts of this paper are therefore of a somewhat technical nature .",
    "readers interested mostly in the stellar kinematical results may wish to skip directly to section  [ ss : results ] .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ s : obsetup ] summarizes the observational setup and strategy .",
    "section  [ s : pos ] discusses the aperture positions for the observations .",
    "section  [ s : datareduc ] describes some aspects of the data reduction .",
    "section  [ s : lsf ] presents calculations of the line - spread function for each observation .",
    "section  [ s : temp ] discusses the template spectrum used in modeling the m32 spectra .",
    "section  [ s : kinematics ] discusses the kinematical analysis .",
    "section  [ s : discussion ] summarizes the main observational results . in the appendices , new calibrations and modeling",
    "are presented of the fos aperture sizes , point - spread - function ( psf ) and line - spread - functions , for which no sufficiently accurate determinations were previously available .",
    "we observed m32 with the red side detector of the hst / fos for nine spacecraft orbits on august 22 , 1995 ( project go-5847 ) .",
    "the costar optics corrected the spherical aberration of the hst primary mirror .",
    "telescope tracking was done in ` fine lock ' .",
    "the rms telescope jitter was typically @xmath26 milli - arcsec ( mas ) .",
    "each orbit consisted of @xmath27 minutes of target visibility time , followed by @xmath28 minutes of earth occultation .",
    "the first two orbits were used to accurately acquire the nucleus of m32 .",
    "subsequently , spectra were taken at various positions near the nucleus .",
    "the g570h grating was used in ` quarter - stepping ' mode , yielding spectra with 2064 pixels covering the wavelength range from 4572  to 6821  .",
    "periods of earth occultation were used to obtain wavelength calibration spectra of the arc lamp . in the last orbit of the observations",
    "the fos was used in a special mode to obtain an image of the central arcsec of m32 , to verify the telescope pointing .",
    "two different square apertures were used to obtain the spectra : the ` 0.1pair ' and the ` 0.25pair ' .",
    "these are the smallest apertures available on the fos .",
    "although they are paired ( two square openings separated by several arcsec ) , they were used exclusively in single - aperture mode .",
    "all data were collected through the upper aperture .",
    "the aperture names are based on their size in arcsec _ before _ the installation of costar .",
    "their nominal post - costar sizes are smaller : @xmath29 square and @xmath30 square , respectively .",
    "evans ( 1995a ) presented calibration observations in which the light throughput was measured for a point source as function of position in the apertures .",
    "models for these observations presented in appendix  [ s : appa ] indicate somewhat smaller aperture sizes : @xmath2 square and @xmath31 square , respectively .",
    "these sizes are adopted in the remainder of the paper .",
    "the natural coordinate system of the fos is the cartesian @xmath32 system defined in the fos instrument handbook ( keyes 1995 ) .",
    "the apertures have their sides parallel to the axes of this system .",
    "the grating disperses the light in the @xmath33-direction .",
    "the @xmath32 system is ` left - handed ' when projected onto the sky . in the following",
    "we adopt a more convenient ` right - handed ' system @xmath34 , defined through @xmath35 and @xmath36 . during the observations ,",
    "the direction of the @xmath37-axis was fixed at a position angle of @xmath38 on the sky .",
    "this coincides with the major axis position angle of m32 ( cf .",
    "lauer 1992 ) .",
    "the position of the m32 center in the hst guide star coordinate system is ra @xmath39 0h 42 m 41.82s , @xmath40 .",
    "the positional uncertainty is dominated by that in the hst guide star catalog itself , which is @xmath20 rms .",
    "hence , some form of acquisition is required to properly position the galaxy in the small apertures . for an extended target with a sharp and well defined brightness maximum , such as m32 ,",
    "the method of choice is a so - called ` peak - up ' acquisition , which consists of a number of ` stages ' .",
    "each stage adopts a rectangular grid of @xmath41 points on the sky , with inter - point spacings of @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "an fos aperture is positioned at each of the grid points , and the total number of counts is measured in some exposure time . the grid point with the most counts",
    "is adopted as new estimate of the target position .",
    "subsequent stages in a sequence use smaller and smaller apertures , with each stage increasing the accuracy of the target positioning .",
    "various standard choices exist for the number of stages , and for the aperture , the grid and the exposure time for each stage in the acquisition ( keyes 1995 ) .",
    "these standard sequences work well for point - source targets .",
    "however , they have not been particularly well tested for extended sources , especially not for acquisitions into the small 0.1-pair aperture .",
    "therefore , as part of the preparation of the observations , a software package was developed to simulate fos peak - up acquisitions of arbitrary targets in a monte - carlo manner ( van der marel 1995 ) .",
    "guided by simulations done with this package , a non - standard 5-stage peak - up sequence was constructed for m32 .",
    "the parameters of this sequence are listed in table  [ t : peakup ] .",
    "the sequence was executed with the g570h grating in place , because m32 is too bright to be acquired with the fos mirror .",
    "the accuracy of the sequence is such that in an idealized situation ( no poisson noise , no telescope jitter , etc . )",
    "@xmath44 and @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the difference between the adopted pointing at the end of the acquisition and the true position of the galaxy center .",
    "the observed intensities in the acquisition stages can be analyzed _ post facto _ , to determine the extent to which the acquisition was successful .",
    "most important are the results of the fifth and final stage , in which the 0.1-pair aperture was sequentially positioned at the points of a @xmath47 grid on the sky , with spacing of @xmath48 between the grid points .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ f : peakup5 ] shows a grey - scale representation of the observations .",
    "the solid dot marks the position with the highest intensity , which was adopted by the telescope software as its best estimate for the position of the galaxy center .    to model the observed intensities , the ` cusp model ' for the unconvolved m32 surface brightness presented by lauer ( 1992 ) was used , which is based on pre - costar hst / wfpc images .",
    "the point - spread - function ( psf ) of the hst+fos was approximated by a sum of gaussians , as determined in appendix  [ s : appa ] .",
    "the total magnitude at each grid point was calculated using the equations in the appendix .",
    "the offset @xmath46 was varied to optimize the fit .",
    "the best fit is displayed in the right panel of figure  [ f : peakup5 ] .",
    "it has @xmath49 , with a formal error in either coordinate ( based on the chi - squared surface of the fit ) of approximately 1 mas .",
    "the target acquisition was thus successful .",
    "an fos image of the central region of m32 was obtained in the final orbit of the observations .",
    "the telescope was commanded to position the upper ` 1.0-pair ' aperture , which has a nominal post - costar size of @xmath50 square , on the galaxy center , after which the intensity on the photocathode was scanned with the diode array of the detector ( with no grating in the light path ) .",
    "the scan pattern was chosen to provide @xmath51 pixels . however , the spatial resolution of the image is poor , @xmath52 , corresponding to the size of one fos diode ( koratkar 1994 ; evans 1995b ) .",
    "the resolution can be improved by deconvolution .",
    "figure  [ f : grey_image ] shows the result of lucy deconvolving the raw image with a boxcar psf with the size of one diode .",
    "the cross marks the galaxy center , while the dot marks the aperture center , i.e. ,  the position where the telescope thought the galaxy center would be .",
    "the latter is offset from the actual galaxy center by @xmath53 ( with a formal error of 3 mas in each coordinate ) .",
    "this offset at the end of the observations is much larger than that achieved by the target acquisition .",
    "hence , positional errors must have accumulated during the observations .",
    "the reason for this is not well understood .",
    "however , the most likely cause is a drift of the telescope pointing due to thermal effects related to the heating and cooling of the spacecraft and fine guidance sensors ( fgss ) during the 14.4 hours of the observations .",
    "such thermal effects exist ( lupie , priv .  comm . ) , but were not previously reported to complicate observations with the fos ( keyes , priv .",
    "comm . ) .",
    "nine spectra were taken .",
    "those obtained with the 0.1-pair aperture are referred to as s1s4 , those obtained with the 0.25-pair aperture as l1l5 .",
    "table  [ t : obsetup ] summarizes the observational setup for each spectrum .",
    "it also lists the position with respect to the galaxy center at which the telescope was instructed to place the aperture .",
    "these _ intended _ aperture placements are illustrated in the left panel of figure  [ f : aper_plot ] .    in reality , the apertures were not placed exactly at their intended positions . the actual position is a sum of two vectors : ( i ) an intentional offset from the ( telescope s estimate of the ) galaxy center ( table  [ t : obsetup ] ) ; and ( ii ) an unintentional offset @xmath46 of the telescope s estimate of the galaxy center from the actual galaxy center .",
    "the intentional offsets are applied by slewing the telescope , which should be very precise ( @xmath54 mas positional error ) . to determine the actual aperture positions one thus needs to know the offset @xmath46 for each observation .",
    "these can be determined by modeling the observed intensities of the spectra , which are listed in table  [ t : applaces ] .",
    "the spectra s1 and s2 , taken in the subsequent orbits # 3 and # 4 , were scheduled to have identical aperture positions ( cf .  table  [ t : obsetup ] ) .",
    "the same holds for the observations l4 and l5 , taken in the subsequent orbits # 8 and # 9 . in both cases , however , the observed intensities in the two spectra are significantly different .",
    "this indicates that the aperture positions must have changed ( by @xmath55 mas , cf .",
    "figure  [ f : telpoint ] below ) between the orbits # 3 and # 4 , and between the orbits # 8 and # 9 .",
    "there was no motion of either the grating wheel or the aperture wheel of the instrument between the different observations .",
    "the guide star reacquisition at the beginning of each orbit is normally accurate to a few mas .",
    "hence , the inferred pointing drifts are indeed most likely due to thermal effects on the fgs .",
    "to proceed we make a number of simplifying assumptions about the offset @xmath46 : ( i ) the offset for the first spectrum , s1 , taken in orbit # 3 , was identical to the offset determined from the final peak - up stage ( figure  [ f : peakup5 ] ) , executed in orbit # 2 ; ( ii ) the offset for the last spectrum , l5 , taken in orbit # 9 , was identical to the offset determined from the fos image ( figure  [ f : grey_image ] ) , taken in that same orbit ; ( iii ) the observations s2s4 , taken in orbits # 4 , # 5 and # 6 , have a common offset ; and ( iv ) the observations l1l4 , taken in orbits # 7 and # 8 , have a common offset .",
    "these assumptions do not allow for positional errors between orbits # 4 and # 5 , between orbits # 5 and # 6 , and between orbits # 7 and # 8 .",
    "even though errors could have occurred , they are not required to fit the observed intensities .",
    "the assumptions do allow for an error between orbits # 6 and # 7 , when the 0.1-pair aperture was replaced by the 0.25-pair aperture .",
    "this is because these apertures might not be exactly concentric on the aperture wheel ( evans 1995 ) , and because the motion of the aperture wheel might have a positional non - repeatability ( dahlem & koratkar 1994 ) .    with these assumptions",
    ", the offset @xmath46 can be determined for each observation by fitting to the observed intensities , using the lauer ( 1992 ) cusp model for the m32 surface brightness , and the aperture sizes and psf determined in appendix  [ s : appa ] .",
    "the results are displayed in figure  [ f : telpoint ] .",
    "the corresponding aperture placements for the individual spectra are listed in table  [ t : applaces ] and are displayed in the right panel of figure  [ f : aper_plot ] .",
    "the fits to the intensities constrain only the absolute value of @xmath56 , and not its sign .",
    "this introduces an ambiguity for l1l4 , which was resolved by adopting the same sign for @xmath56 as measured in figure  [ f : grey_image ] ( so as to minimize the size of the positional error between orbits # 8 and # 9 ) . at the positions of the apertures ( along the major axis ) , the surface brightness changes more rapidly along the @xmath37 direction than along the @xmath57-direction",
    "hence , the observed intensities constrain the @xmath58 more tightly than the @xmath56 . other model assumptions to fit the observed intensities",
    "were also studied . in all cases the results for @xmath58 agreed to within a few mas , while the @xmath56 could differ by as much as @xmath59 .",
    "most of the necessary data reduction steps are performed by the hst calibration ` pipeline ' . for the m32 data ,",
    "three issues required additional attention : ( i ) wavelength calibration ; ( ii ) absolute sensitivity calibration ; and ( iii ) flat - fielding .",
    "the wavelength scale provided by the calibration pipeline is not accurate enough for our project .",
    "arc lamp spectra were therefore obtained in each orbit during occultation .",
    "the emission line centers were determined , yielding for each arc spectrum @xmath60 and for each line @xmath61 with vacuum wavelength @xmath62 , the observed wavelength @xmath63 on the scale provided by the calibration pipeline .",
    "subsequently , the observed offsets @xmath64 were fit as @xmath65 the constant offset @xmath66 is the result of non - repeatability in the fos grating and aperture wheels , and was measured to be @xmath67 .",
    "the third order polynomial @xmath68 with zero mean accounts for a slight ( @xmath69 ) non - linearity of the wavelength scale .",
    "the offsets @xmath70 account for constant shifts of the wavelength scale from orbit to orbit , mostly due to the ` geo - magnetically induced image motion problem ' ( keyes 1995 ) .",
    "these shifts ranged between @xmath71 , and could be determined with @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) accuracy .",
    "the wavelength scale of the m32 spectra was corrected using the above fits to the arc spectra .",
    "an additional shift of @xmath74 was applied to correct for the fact that the light path for external targets differs from that for the internal arc lamp ( keyes 1995 ) . for each m32 spectrum",
    "the @xmath70 were used that was / were determined from the arc spectrum / spectra obtained immediately preceding or following the m32 spectrum .",
    "the fact that the arc spectra are never obtained completely simultaneously with galaxy spectra introduces a slight additional uncertainty . the cumulative uncertainty in the mean streaming velocities of the stars as a result of uncertainties in the wavelength scale is estimated to be @xmath75 .",
    "this is always smaller than the formal errors in these velocities as a result of photon noise ( cf .",
    "table  [ t : kinresults ] below ) .",
    "after wavelength calibration ( and absolute sensitivity calibration and flat - fielding as described below ) the galaxy spectra were rebinned logarithmically in wavelength , as required for the stellar kinematical analysis .",
    "a scale of @xmath76pixel was used .",
    "the fos is a photon counting detector , so the formal errors in the spectra follow directly from poisson statistics . on average ,",
    "the ( logarithmic ) rebinning decreases the formal errors , since it reduces the scatter between neighboring pixels .",
    "the decrease can be calculated for each pixel , and was taken into account in the subsequent analysis .",
    "the correlation between the errors in neighboring pixels induced by the rebinning was neglected .",
    "the calibration pipeline multiplies the observed count rate spectra by a so - called ` inverse sensitivity file ' ( ivs ) , to obtain fluxes in @xmath77@xmath78 .",
    "the pipeline ivs files contain a wavelength dependent aperture throughput correction , based on calibration observations of point sources .",
    "these , however , are not applicable to extended sources .",
    "therefore , instead of the standard pipeline ivs file a more recent ivs file with no aperture throughput correction was used , provided to us by fos instrument scientist tony keyes .",
    "each wavelength in the m32 spectra samples a slightly different region of the galaxy , because of the wavelength dependence of the psf .",
    "this influences only the continuum slope of the spectra , because the psf varies very slowly with wavelength . in the stellar kinematical analysis one",
    "is only interested in the absorption lines , which are not influenced .",
    "the underlying continuum is subtracted .",
    "hence , no attempt was made to construct aperture throughput corrections .",
    "( in fact , this would require accurate knowledge of the wavelength dependence of the psf , which is not readily available for the fos ; see appendix  [ s : appa ] ) .",
    "a g570h flat - field based on multiple 0.25-pair ( upper ) aperture observations of a star was used , as provided to us by tony keyes .",
    "no flat - fields obtained explicitly with the 0.1-pair ( upper ) aperture were available .",
    "a star illuminates the photocathode of the detector differently than an extended source . to test the appropriateness of the flat - field for the m32 data it was cross - correlated with the continuum subtracted normalized galaxy spectra .",
    "this yielded clear peaks , indicating that the flat - field and the m32 spectra share the same features ( as they should ) .",
    "the peak was only @xmath7910% lower for the 0.1-pair spectra than for the 0.25-pair spectra .",
    "this indicates that the flat - field can be properly used for the 0.1-pair ( upper ) aperture as well , although a flat - field obtained specifically with that aperture would have been preferable .",
    "shifts between the galaxy spectra and flat - field were identified from the positions of the cross - correlation peaks , and were corrected for ( see also kormendy 1996a ) .",
    "the flat - fielding removes most of the pixel - to - pixel sensitivity variations , but some small residual variations might remain .",
    "the observed spectrum of a source is the convolution of its actual spectrum with the line - spread - function @xmath80 .",
    "the lsf can be written as the convolution of an ` illumination function ' @xmath81 and an ` instrumental broadening function ' @xmath82 ( cf .",
    "appendix  [ s : appb ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath81 is the normalized intensity distribution of the light that falls onto the grating .",
    "it depends on the target brightness and choice of aperture .",
    "the direction of dispersion is parallel to the @xmath57 direction .",
    "hence , @xmath81 is the integral over the @xmath37 direction of the two - dimensional brightness distribution that falls onto the grating . for the psf and aperture sizes derived in appendix  [ s : appa ] , @xmath81 is given by equations  ( [ blamdef ] ) and  ( [ bkernel ] ) in appendix  [ s : appb ] .",
    "it can be calculated for each observation upon substitution of the lauer ( 1992 ) cusp model for the m32 surface brightness , and the aperture positions in table  [ t : applaces ] .",
    "the normalized function @xmath82 accounts for the instrumental broadening due to the grating and finite size of a detector diode ( the resolution element ) .",
    "it was determined empirically from fits to the emission line shapes in the arc spectra , as discussed in appendix  [ s : appb ] .",
    "the lsf has zero mean if the galaxy light is distributed symmetrically within the aperture .",
    "this is not generally the case , because the aperture centers are not exactly at @xmath83 ( figure  [ f : aper_plot ] ) .",
    "calculations show that the intensity weighted mean position is within @xmath84 from the aperture center for all the observations . nonetheless , there are noticeable wavelength shifts , because @xmath84 projects onto @xmath85 in the wavelength direction ( @xmath86 at 5170 )",
    ". table  [ t : applaces ] lists the lsf mean as calculated for each of the m32 spectra , both in  and in @xmath6 at 5170 .",
    "errors in these values due to errors in the aperture positions do not exceed 0.04 ( @xmath87 at 5170 ) .",
    "the width and shape of the lsf are determined mainly by the aperture size .",
    "the calculated lsfs for all the m32 spectra are shown in figure  [ f : lsf ] .",
    "the lsf shapes for the 0.1-pair observations are very similar to each other , as are the lsf shapes for the 0.25-pair observations .",
    "the shapes are also similar to the emission line shapes observed directly in arc spectra ( figure  [ f : arc ] ) .",
    "the 0.25-pair lsf can be well approximated by convolving the 0.1-pair lsf by a gaussian with a dispersion of @xmath88 ( @xmath89 at 5170 ) , as illustrated by the dotted curve in figure  [ f : lsf ] .",
    "the best - fitting gaussian to the 0.1-pair lsf has a dispersion of @xmath90 ( @xmath91 at 5170 ) . for the 0.25-pair lsf",
    "it has a dispersion of @xmath92 ( @xmath93 at 5170 ) .",
    "however , these numbers are of limited use in characterizing the lsfs , since these have noticeably broader wings than a gaussian .",
    "for stellar kinematical analysis a template spectrum is needed to compare the m32 spectra to . to avoid systematic errors",
    "it is important to minimize template mismatching .",
    "this is best done by constructing a composite template which contains an appropriate mix of spectral types .",
    "observing template stars with the hst is inefficient and time consuming ( mainly because of the lengthy target acquisitions that are required ) . to date less than a handful different template stars have been observed with the hst , all of similar spectral type .",
    "these hst spectra are insufficient to construct an optimal template .",
    "a ground - based template library of spectra of 27 stars of different spectral types was therefore used , obtained in february 1990 by m.  franx at the 4 m telescope of the kpno with the rc spectrograph ( as discussed previously by van der marel & franx 1993 ) .",
    "the lsf of these spectra is approximately gaussian with a dispersion of @xmath94 ( @xmath95 at 5170 ) .",
    "the spectra cover the spectral range from 4836 to 5547 , centered on the mg b triplet at @xmath96 .",
    "this is the most useful wavelength range for stellar kinematical analysis , so it is no drawback that this range is smaller than the full range covered by the fos g570h grating .",
    "the stellar spectra were similarly rebinned logarithmically as the galaxy spectra , and shifted to a common velocity .",
    "no attempt was made to construct a different composite template for each m32 spectrum ( which is reasonable , given that there are no strong color gradients in the central arcsec ; lugger 1992 ) .",
    "instead , the best fit was sought to a grand - total m32 spectrum , constructed by summing the hst spectra .",
    "the resulting composite template is a weighted mix of the individual templates , with the weights determined using the method outlined in appendix  a.3 of van der marel ( 1994a ) .",
    "the mix contains giants , sub - giants and dwarfs of spectral types  g and  k.    the composite template is used in the remainder of the paper .",
    "however , other templates were studied as well .",
    "for example , a stellar kinematical analysis was performed with a k - star template spectrum obtained from the hst data archive , taken with the fos circular 0.3 aperture ( @xmath97 diameter ) by h.  ford and collaborators before the installation of costar .",
    "this template provides a poor fit to the spectrum of m32 .",
    "nonetheless , the stellar kinematical properties inferred with this template were found to be consistent with those derived using the composite template .",
    "the stellar kinematical analysis was performed with the method presented in van der marel ( 1994a ) .",
    "it fits the convolution of a parametrized velocity profile and a template spectrum to a galaxy spectrum in pixel space , using chi - squared minimization .",
    "the formal errors in the fit parameters follow from the shape of the chi - squared surface near its minimum .",
    "the method has been well tested , and its results agree with those from other methods for extracting stellar kinematics from galaxy spectra .",
    "deviations of the line - of - sight velocity profiles from gaussians contain useful information on the dynamical structure of galaxies .",
    "unfortunately , the velocity resolution of the fos is too poor to extract any reliable velocity profile shape information from the m32 data .",
    "the analysis was therefore restricted to gaussian velocity profile fits .",
    "data obtained with the fos is time resolved .",
    "the red side detector reads and stores the data every @xmath98 minutes .",
    "between 6 and 20 spectra were therefore available per aperture position .",
    "the aperture positions for the observations l4 and l5 differ by @xmath99 , but both are at a distance of @xmath20 from the galaxy center , where kinematical gradients are small . in the kinematical analysis l4 and l5",
    "were therefore treated as a single observation , referred to as l45 . especially for the 0.1-pair observations , the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of the individual read - outs is low .",
    "individual read - outs for a given aperture position were therefore added to achieve an average s / n of @xmath100 per ( logarithmically rebinned ) pixel .",
    "this resulted in 4 independent spectra for each of the observations s1s4 with the 0.1-pair aperture , and between 9 and 11 independent spectra for the observations l1 , l2 , l3 and l45 with the 0.25-pair aperture .",
    "a stellar kinematical analysis was performed on each of these spectra .",
    "the kinematical results for each aperture position were then averaged together , weighted with the errors .",
    "it was found that this yields slightly more accurate results than a kinematical analysis of the sum of the individual spectra for a given aperture position .",
    "no systematic trends with time in the orbit were found in the kinematical results .",
    "the stellar kinematical analysis was performed over the wavelength range 48595520 .",
    "regions influenced by so - called ` noisy ' diodes were masked .",
    "the fit to the galaxy spectrum includes a low order polynomial to account for continuum differences between the galaxy and template spectrum .",
    "this polynomial is fit simultaneously with the velocity profile .",
    "the parameters of the best - fitting velocity profile are virtually independent of the choice of polynomial order .",
    "a polynomial of order 5 was used .      the mean velocity and velocity dispersion of the best - fitting gaussian velocity profiles",
    "must be corrected for instrumental effects .",
    "the mean velocity is biased because the lsf mean is non - zero .",
    "this bias is removed by subtracting the corrections @xmath101 listed in table  [ t : applaces ] .",
    "these were calculated for the wavelength 5170 of the mg b triplet , but the wavelength dependence of the velocity corrections over the fit range is negligible ( @xmath102 in absolute value ) .",
    "further , to obtain velocities in the m32 frame one must subtract a constant offset , determined by the difference between the systemic velocity of m32 and the template velocity .",
    "these were not known accurately enough to determine the offset directly , and it was therefore estimated from the data itself .",
    "somewhat arbitrarily , it was fixed to the intercept of the best least - squares fit line in a plot ( see figure  [ f : allres]c below ) of rotation versus position @xmath37 along the m32 major axis for the observations s4 , s1 and s2 ( for which @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , respectively ) .",
    "the velocity dispersions @xmath106 of the best - fitting gaussians must be corrected for differences in the lsfs of the template and galaxy spectra . for this",
    "it is useful to consider not the observed dispersions themselves , but rather differences in the observed dispersions between two observations .",
    "let @xmath107 and @xmath108 be the best - fitting dispersions for observations at positions a and b. assume that the lsf of observation b can be obtained from the lsf of observation a through convolution with a gaussian of dispersion @xmath109 .",
    "the difference between the actual dispersions at positions a and b can then be estimated as : @xmath110 ( which uses the fact that the convolution of two gaussians is again a gaussian , the dispersion of which is the rms sum of the input dispersions ) .",
    "this approach has two important advantages .",
    "first , the lsf of the template influences the kinematical analysis at points a and b in the same way , so it does not enter into @xmath111 .",
    "second , the differences in the lsfs for the hst observations can in fact to good approximation be accounted for by convolution with a gaussian ( cf .",
    "figure  [ f : lsf ] ) .",
    "one does _ not _ have to assume that the lsfs themselves are gaussian , which would be a poor approximation .    in the following , the observation l45 at @xmath20 from the galaxy center is used as ` reference point ' .",
    "equation  ( [ sigdef ] ) then yields @xmath112 where @xmath113 for an observation with the 0.25-pair aperture , and @xmath114 for an observation with the 0.1-pair ( based on the results of section  [ s : lsf ] ) .",
    "the latter value was calculated for the wavelength 5170 of the mg b triplet , which is roughly at the center of the fit range .",
    "the actual value of @xmath115 varies from @xmath116 to @xmath117 over the fit range , which can be taken into account by assigning a ` formal ' error of @xmath118 to @xmath109 .",
    "equation  ( [ sigcor ] ) can be used to estimate the stellar velocity dispersion @xmath119 for any of the observations s1s4 and l1l3 , if one assumes that the dispersion @xmath120 at the position of observation l45 is known a priori . at @xmath121 along the major axis one",
    "is beyond the region most influenced by seeing in ground - based data .",
    "based on the data of van der marel ( 1994a ) and bender , kormendy & dehnen ( 1996 ) it was assumed that @xmath122 ( see figure  [ f : allres]d below ) .",
    "it is demonstrated in appendix  [ s : appc ] that the velocity dispersions thus obtained have no systematic biases , and that even velocity dispersions as small as @xmath23 can be measured reliably , in spite of the large fos instrumental dispersion of @xmath123 .",
    "the formal errors in dispersions @xmath119 obtained from equation  ( [ sigcor ] ) follow from the errors in @xmath106 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 using a standard first order error analysis .",
    "systematic errors due to template mismatching are not likely to exceed a few @xmath6 , and are smaller than the formal errors in the measurements .",
    "table  [ t : kinresults ] lists the line strengths , rotation velocities and velocity dispersions , after correction for all instrumental effects .",
    "these results are discussed below .",
    "figure  [ f : allres ] displays the results as function of the position @xmath37 of the aperture center along the m32 major axis .",
    "the best spatial resolution ground - based m32 data are also shown .",
    "these are the data from van der marel ( 1994a ) obtained at the william herschel telescope ( wht ) , and those of bender , kormendy & dehnen ( 1996 ) obtained at the canada france hawaii telescope ( cfht ) .",
    "a comparison of these ground - based data to older ( lower spatial resolution ) ground - based data can be found in kormendy & richstone ( 1995 ) .",
    "the spatial resolution for each of the observations in figure  [ f : allres ] is characterized by a convolution kernel , which results from the psf and finite aperture size ( for ground - based long - slit data the effective aperture is the spatial ccd pixel size by the slit width ) .",
    "the top left - panel illustrates the difference in spatial resolution between the data sets .",
    "it displays the projection of the convolution kernel along the m32 minor axis , i.e. , the probability @xmath127 that a photon observed in a given aperture was emitted at distance @xmath37 from the center of that aperture , measured along the m32 major axis .",
    "these probability distributions have fwhm values of @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 , for the hst / fos/0.1-pair , hst / fos/0.25-pair , cfht and wht data , respectively .",
    "the hst data therefore provide a factor 5 increase in spatial resolution over even the best available ground - based data .",
    "the line strengths shown in figure  [ f : allres]b were normalized to an average of unity ( line strengths are measured with respect to the template spectrum , and are hence on an arbitrary scale ) .",
    "there is no obvious trend with radius .",
    "the observations with the 0.1-pair aperture closest to the nucleus have relatively low line strength , but this is unlikely to be real .",
    "metallicities and line strengths generally increase towards the centers of galaxies",
    ". the observed low values could be an artifact due to the presence of a black hole .",
    "the stars that move rapidly near the black hole produce broad velocity profile wings .",
    "these can be mistaken for an enhanced continuum , which causes the line strength to be underestimated ( van der marel 1994b ) .",
    "the broad - band colors of m32 are constant in the central arcsec ( lugger 1992 ) . the true line strengths in the central @xmath132 covered by the hst observations are therefore probably also close to constant .",
    "the observed line strengths have a sizable rms scatter of @xmath133 .",
    "this exceeds the formal errors , which are on average @xmath134 .",
    "the measurements are therefore not statistically consistent with a constant line strength ( as is confirmed by a chi - squared test ) .",
    "the scatter in the observed line strengths could be the result of minor inaccuracies in the data , such as unidentified bad pixels or flat - field errors , or it could be real , and due to shot noise in the contributions from individual stars .",
    "the total v - band luminosity inside the aperture varies from @xmath135 ( for observation s3 ) to @xmath136 ( for observation l3 ) .",
    "most of the observed light comes from giants , some of which can be as luminous as @xmath137 ( freedman 1989 ) .",
    "the luminosity of a ` typical ' giant as measured from surface brightness fluctuations ( tonry , ajhar & luppino 1990 ) is @xmath138 .",
    "this implies that there are @xmath139 typical stars in each hst aperture .",
    "therefore , @xmath140 fluctuations can be of order a few percent of the intrinsic line strength differences between stars .",
    "figure  [ f : allres]c shows the rotation velocities .",
    "the hst rotation curve is smooth .",
    "it is significantly steeper in the central @xmath141 than seen in the ground - based data , consistent with the presence of a central black hole .",
    "the rotation velocity is observed to be @xmath142 at @xmath1 from the nucleus .",
    "this is roughly twice the value measured from the ground at this distance .",
    "the scatter in the line strength measurements ( figure  [ f : allres]b ) induces scatter in the velocity dispersion measurements , because the velocity dispersion and line strength of a gaussian fit are statistically correlated .",
    "tests indicate that a line strength error @xmath143 induces an error @xmath144 in the velocity dispersion .",
    "rotation velocity measurements are not influenced .",
    "to avoid unwanted errors in the velocity dispersion measurements , they were determined by fitting gaussian velocity profiles to the data while keeping the line strength constant to the mean of the measurements in figure  [ f : allres]b .",
    "this yields velocity dispersions that differ only at the @xmath145 level from those obtained by gaussian fits with variable line strength , so the main results do not depend on this correction .",
    "figure  [ f : allres]d shows the resulting velocity dispersions .",
    "the dispersion measured with the 0.1-pair aperture closest to the nucleus is @xmath3 .",
    "the profile of the velocity dispersion with radius is smooth , with the exception of the measurement @xmath146 from observation s2 , which is significantly lower than that for the other observations in the central @xmath1 .",
    "we doubt the reality of this , but have not been able to attribute it to any known instrumental effect .",
    "the average of the four dispersion measurements inside @xmath1 is @xmath4 , with a rms scatter of @xmath5 .",
    "hence , the central velocity dispersion is definitely higher than the 8595@xmath6 determined from ground - based measurements .",
    "it thus appears that a keplerian increase in the velocity dispersion close to the center of m32 has been resolved .",
    "the difference in the dispersions measured for observations  s1 and  s2 , which were obtained with the same aperture at similar positions , indicates that uncertainties in the velocity dispersions are dominated by systematic errors , rather than poisson noise .",
    "systematic errors in the rotation velocity measurements are believed to be much smaller , primarily because these are less sensitive to the poor instrumental resolution of the fos .",
    "either way , the data clearly imply that the dispersion in the central @xmath1 is higher than measured from ground - based data . whether the nuclear dispersion seen through a small aperture",
    "is indeed as high as @xmath147 should await verification by observations with the future hst spectrograph stis .",
    "hst / fos spectra were obtained through small apertures centered on the nuclear region and major axis of m32 .",
    "kinematical analysis of these data is more complicated than it is for ground - based data : the fos is a low - resolution spectrograph , and is not particularly well suited for dynamical studies of low - dispersion objects such as m32 .",
    "one of the main results of this paper is therefore that stellar kinematical quantities _ can _ in fact be determined from the data , provided that a detailed study is made of various technical issues , including : calibration and modeling of the fos aperture sizes , psf and lsfs , determination of the aperture positions from the data , accurate wavelength calibration , template matching , and corrections for instrumental resolution .",
    "the resulting kinematical quantities are displayed in figure  [ f : allres ] .",
    "the main result is that in the central @xmath1 the m32 rotation curve is significantly steeper , and the velocity dispersion significantly higher , than measured from even the highest resolution ground - based data .",
    "these observational results are robust .",
    "they do not depend critically on the corrections made in the analysis ; even a rough analysis without any template matching and corrections for instrumental effects shows these main features .",
    "the results are exactly what would be expected if m32 does indeed have a massive dark object in its nucleus , as suggested previously on the basis of ground - based data . in the companion papers in this series ( van der marel 1997a , b ; cretton 1997 ) we construct dynamical models to address the presence of such a dark object quantitatively .",
    "we also address the question whether the dark object has to be a black hole , or whether plausible alternatives still exist .",
    "the authors are grateful to the fos instrument scientists tony keyes , anuradha koratkar and michael dahlem for helpful discussions , and to bill workman and jean surdej for successful scheduling and implementation of the observations .",

    "figure  [ f : arc ] shows the fits to the arc lines and the best - fitting function @xmath195 .",
    "no evidence was found for a wavelength dependence of the lsf over the wavelength range covered by the grating .",
    "the best - fit parameters are : @xmath201 and @xmath202 for the 0.1-pair aperture , and @xmath203 and @xmath204 for the 0.25-pair aperture . hence , the function @xmath82 is broader for the 0.25-pair aperture than for the 0.1-pair .",
    "the difference is too large to be attributed to small errors in the assumed aperture sizes .",
    "hence , the instrumental broadening is more complicated in reality than in our simplified model , in which one would have expected @xmath82 to be independent of the aperture size .",
    "however , the only important point for the interpretation of the m32 spectra is that an accurate empirical description of the lsf is available .",
    "the fits in figure  [ f : arc ] suggest that the model is satisfactory for this purpose .",
    "tests with artificial galaxy spectra were performed to determine whether systematic biases could be present in the velocity dispersion measurements .",
    "artificial galaxy spectra were created from each of the 27 stellar spectra in the template library , by broadening them with gaussian velocity profiles with dispersions @xmath205 .",
    "twenty copies were made of each broadened template , and noise was added to yield a s / n of 10 per pixel .",
    "a stellar kinematical analysis was then performed on each copy , using the composite spectrum discussed in section  [ s : temp ] as template .",
    "the twenty velocity dispersion measurements where then averaged to yield an output velocity dispersion @xmath206 .",
    "figure  [ f : kintest ] plots @xmath206 as function of @xmath205 for each of the input spectra .",
    "the results lie closely along the line @xmath207 .",
    "the minor deviations can be attributed entirely to the template mismatch in the simulations ( the input stellar spectra are giants , sub - giants and dwarfs of spectral types g , k and m ) . at dispersions below @xmath208",
    "there is some tendency for the dispersion to be underestimated .",
    "however , for the m32 observations one is always in the situation where the difference in dispersion between the galaxy and template spectrum is @xmath209 ( because the lsf of the galaxy spectra is broader than that of the template , in addition to the kinematical doppler broadening ) . at these dispersions",
    "there are no significant biases in the results of the kinematical analysis , but only small ( @xmath210 ) errors due to template mismatching .",
    "these errors are nearly independent of the velocity dispersion .",
    "since the approach used in this paper for determining velocity dispersions relies on differences between velocity dispersion measurements at different positions , it is expected that even these small errors largely cancel out .",
    "a crude consistency check on our approach for determining velocity dispersions can be obtained by making the ( poor ) assumption that the lsfs of both the galaxy and template spectra are gaussian , with dispersions @xmath211 and @xmath212 , respectively .",
    "the stellar velocity dispersion @xmath119 then follows from the dispersion @xmath213 obtained by fitting to the galaxy spectrum , according to : @xmath214 for the observation l45 the dispersion measured directly from the spectra is @xmath215 . upon substitution in equation  ( [ sigcorgau ] ) of @xmath216 ( cf .",
    "section  [ s : temp ] ) , and @xmath217 ( cf .",
    "section  [ s : lsf ] ) one obtains the estimate @xmath218 for the stellar velocity dispersion at @xmath20 along the m32 major axis .",
    "this agrees reasonably well with the value of @xmath219 adopted in section  [ s : correc ] on the basis of ground - based measurements .",
    "this confirms the result of appendix  [ s : ctests ] that there are no systematic biases in the velocity dispersion measurements from the spectra , and that the differences in the lsfs of the template and galaxy spectra can be fully corrected for .",
