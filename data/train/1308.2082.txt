    "it is important to highlight that the dzyaloshinsky - moriya interaction has no effect on the magnon energy at the @xmath94 point .",
    "secondly , there is a gap in the spectrum due to the on - site and two - site anisotropy terms , the latter one corresponding to the difference between the diagonal elements of the coupling tensor .",

    "the first two terms have peaks at @xmath113 values , because due to the form of the perturbing field the response of the system , @xmath108 , will be an even function of @xmath114 .",
    "the other two peaks describe the physical behaviour of the system : if dzyaloshinsky - moriya interactions are present , the energies of the @xmath111 and @xmath112 magnons will differ , therefore , we will get two peaks instead of a single one",
    ". these peaks can be distinguished if the damping is not too large , that is the half - width of the peaks is smaller than the distance between them : @xmath115 .",
    "however , at @xmath116 , @xmath117 will only have a single peak , because the dzyaloshinsky - moriya interaction has no effect on the spectrum at the @xmath94 point .",
    "similar results for the resonance response of fe / w(@xmath22 ) were obtained in @xcite , using a macroscopic model of the film .",
    "note that the damping decreases the magnon energies .",

    ", the response of the system will only contain information about excitations with wave vector @xmath116 , the energy of which is , in principle , unaffected by the dzyaloshinsky - moriya interactions .",

    "was simply set to zero at the corresponding lattice site . in the model",
    "the same simplifications were used as in ( [ lineq1 ] ) and ( [ lineq2 ] ) , that is @xmath83 and @xmath84 , while a homogeneous external magnetic field was considered , @xmath119 . in case of a perfect lattice , equations ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) have clearly the same form for every lattice point , that is the reason why the discrete fourier transformation could be used to decouple these equations .",
    "however if a vacancy is present in the system , these equations take a different form at lattice points neighbouring the defect , since one of the terms will be missing .",
    "apart from these six lattice points , the four nearest - neighbour and the two next - nearest - neighbour sites around the vacancy , the equations again look the same for all the spins . therefore in this model ,",
    "only the six neighbours of the vacancy were considered and another  average  lattice point , which does not miss a coupling due to the presence of the vacancy .",
    "all together one can get a system of coupled equations listed in [ lattdefapp ] which have to be solved simultaneously . by solving these equations , again the response to the external excitation @xmath120",
    "was calculated in terms of equation ( [ s ] ) .",
    "figures [ d0d0j](a ) and [ d0d01lyuk50](a ) show the results of numerical calculations for @xmath120 . according to our previous expectations based on the creation of finite wave vector magnons in a disordered system , even in the case of a homogeneous perturbation ,",
    "if the dzyaloshinsky - moriya interactions are present , lattice defects visibly decrease the magnon energy with respect to the case of a perfect lattice .",
    "overall , this is a quite small effect , proportional to the square of the @xmath121 ratio  this is evidenced by the fact that the direction of the shift does not depend on the sign of this value , that is the same curve is obtained by setting @xmath122 . on the other hand , the effect is larger if different diagonal exchange coupling coefficients are considered .",
    "it was discussed above that , even in a perfect lattice , two - site anisotropy increases the gap in the magnon dispersion at the @xmath94 point . as a consequence of the lattice defects ,",
    "this gap is decreased as well , and this effect is larger than the one due to the dzyaloshinsky - moriya interaction . note that if only on - site anisotropy is taken into account , the lineshape of @xmath120 is not modified by lattice defects ( see appendix [ lattdefapp ] ) .",
    "a possible explanation for this is that the on - site anisotropy only shifts the magnon spectrum by an additive constant , being independent of the wave vector . in general",
    ", it can be concluded that lattice defects may be a source of magnon softening .",

    "it is still possible to calculate response functions at finite temperatures by solving a system of deterministic differential equations for the first and second moments of the spin components .",
    "the method used to treat interacting particles in a mean field approach was originally applied by raikher and shliomis@xcite for noninteracting magnetic particles possessing an easy orientation axis . here",
    "it is generalized to interacting particles in a mean field approach .",

    "it is straightforward to calculate the equations for the first and second moments , in the latter , case using it s formula , @xmath129 where @xmath130 denotes stochastic expectation value . in order to calculate the linear response ,",
    "the effective field is divided into an unperturbed part and a perturbation , @xmath131 , and the perturbation will be a time - dependent external magnetic field as in the previous section . in absence of the perturbing field , the equilibrium distribution of the spins corresponds to the boltzmann distribution , as this is the property that determines the standard deviation of the stochastic noise at finite temperatures ( see @xcite ) .",

    "suppose that the unperturbed hamiltonian has the form , @xmath139 that is we only consider diagonal coupling coefficients between the nearest neighbour spins and easy - axis anisotropy .",
    "this system is time - reversal invariant , therefore all expectation values will vanish which contain an odd number of spin components .",

    "the results of the theoretical methods presented here were in good agreement with numerical simulations .",
    "it is worth to generalize them to other lattice types , including three dimensional structures , to other types of interactions , or even to antiferromagnets .",
    "finally , it is worth to mention that strong effects of point - like defects on the magnon lifetime in noncollinear antiferromagnets have very recently been demonstrated by brenig _",

    "as noted in section [ lattdef ] , one has to consider the angle variables at the four nearest - neighbour and the two next - nearest - neighbour sites sites of a vacancy separately from the others , since when one writes down equations ( [ eq1])-([eq2 ] ) for these lattice points , some terms will be missing .",
    "lattice points further away from the vacancy will be described by an ",
    "average  angle variable , since all of their nearest - neighbour and next - nearest - neighbour lattice sites contain a spin . of course",
    "these points are not exactly equivalent , since a lattice point that is two lattice vectors far from the defect has a common neighbour with the vacancy , while this is not true for lattice points further away .",
    "this difference is only noticeable in higher order calculations .    for this ",
    "average  angle variable , one has to sum up the linearized equations ( [ eq1])-([eq2 ] ) for all lattice points , and divide them with the number of lattice points . here the effect of the vacancy is that a term must be subtracted from the original equations , corresponding to the nearest - neighbour and next - nearest - neighbour sites of the defect .",
    "since in a large enough lattice the effect of a single defect is hardly noticeable , multiple vacancies can be considered by multiplying this subtracted term by their number , this is a relatively good approximation if the vacancies are still far from each other .",
    "this means that if in a lattice with @xmath81 points , @xmath8 spins are set to zero , the correct normalization for the  average  variable is @xmath256 for @xmath257 . using the notations in figure [ nearvac ]",
    ", it can be seen that out of the six lattice points next to the vacancies , only four of them lead to different equations . therefore , the following ten linear differential equations are to be solved simultaneously , @xmath258",
