    "it was often considered that the higher @xmath5 values observed in these galaxies are attributed to the inflow of disk gas with high @xmath6c@xmath2c abundance ratios , possibly combined with a @xmath6c enhancement caused by nucleosynthesis in massive stars ( e.g. , henkel et al .",
    "however , since most previous studies investigated only the ratios , it is uncertain whether or not these luminous starburst galaxies are overluminous in @xmath6co or underluminous in @xmath7co ( casoli et al .",

    ", comparing the luminosities of @xmath6co(@xmath1=10 ) , @xmath7co(@xmath1=10 ) ( hereafter @xmath6co and @xmath7co , respectively ) , and fir emission for a sample of starburst and normal galaxies for which all the data are available in literature , we show that the observed higher @xmath5 values are mainly attributed to a lower intensity in @xmath7co with respect to @xmath6co .",
    "we discuss possible physical mechanisms which can explain the @xmath7co(@xmath1=10 ) depression in luminous starburst galaxies .",
    "we have compiled @xmath6co and @xmath7co intensities from the literature ( wiklind & henkel 1990 ; aalto et al . 1991 , 1995 ;",

    "our sample consists of 51 galaxies including ultraluminous infrared galaxies such as arp 220 .",
    "these data are used to estimate the co luminosities ; @xmath8(co ) is defined as @xmath8(co)@xmath11(co ) k km s@xmath12 pc@xmath13 where @xmath14 is the observed area in units of pc@xmath13 and @xmath15(co)@xmath16 k km s@xmath12 where @xmath17 is the observed antenna temperature corrected for atmospheric extinction and @xmath18 is the main beam efficiency .",

    "distances of nearby galaxies are taken from the nearby galaxies catalog ( tully 1988 ) ; distances of other galaxies are estimated using a hubble constant @xmath23 = 75 km s@xmath12 mpc@xmath12 with @xmath24 ( radial velocity corrected to the galactic center : de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "the compiled data are given in table 1 .",
    "though our sample is not statistically complete , it is the largest sample compiled so far .    as shown in table 1",
    ", there are several galaxies which have @xmath25 .",
    "hereafter we refer to these sources as high-@xmath5 galaxies ( ngc 1614 , ngc 3256 , ngc 4194 , ngc 6240 , arp 220 , and arp 299 ) .",
    "eso 541ig 23 [ = arp 236 , @xmath26 ( lower limit ) ] and possibly iras 18293@xmath273413 ( @xmath28 : garay et al .",
    "1993 ; @xmath29 : aalto et al .",
    "1995 ) are also high-@xmath5 galaxies . in total",
    ", there are eight high-@xmath5 galaxies in our sample . except for the uncertain case of iras 18293@xmath273413 , all these high-@xmath5 galaxies are mergers . for the remaining 43 galaxies ,",
    "we obtain an average ratio , @xmath30 .",
    "the values are consistent with previous estimates of @xmath31 ( aalto et al .",
    "1991 ) and @xmath32 ( sage & isbell 1991 ) for normal galaxies .",
    "first , we examine whether or not there is a beam size effect on @xmath5 because the co line observations did not cover the whole area of the individual galaxies",
    ". ratios of beam size ( @xmath33 = half power beam width ) to optical diameter at 25 mag arcsec@xmath34 ( @xmath35 : de vaucouleurs et al . 1991 ) are given in the third column of table 1 . in figure 1",
    ", @xmath36 is plotted as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "we find no clear correlation , indicating that the difference in @xmath5 can not be attributed to the beam - size effect .    in figure 2 , we compare @xmath8(@xmath6co ) with @xmath8(@xmath7co ) .",
    "a tight correlation is found for galaxies with @xmath8(@xmath6co)@xmath37 k",
    "km s@xmath12 pc@xmath13",
    ". this almost linear correlation can be expressed as log @xmath8(@xmath7co)@xmath38(@xmath39)@xmath40 log @xmath8(@xmath6co)@xmath41(@xmath42 ) .",
    "however , more luminous galaxies do not follow the same correlation , i.e. , some of the luminous galaxies have lower @xmath7co luminosities with respect to @xmath6co .    in figure 3",
    ", we compare @xmath8(fir ) with both @xmath8(@xmath6co ) and @xmath8(@xmath7co ) .",
    "it is shown that @xmath8(@xmath6co ) is well correlated with @xmath8(fir ) ; its correlation coefficient is 0.94 .",
    "the average @xmath43co)/@xmath8(fir ) for the high-@xmath5 galaxies , 0.013@xmath440.007 , is similar to that for the normal ones , 0.023@xmath440.013 .",
    "this correlation has been noted in many previous studies ( e.g. , young & scoville 1991 and references therein ) .",
    "in fact , figure 3 shows that the correlation is established within a factor of three dispersion except for one galaxy ( ngc 55 ) which is a nearby magellanic - type irregular galaxy ( becker & freudling 1991 ) . on the other hand",
    ", the correlation between @xmath8(fir ) and @xmath8(@xmath7co ) appears to be significantly poorer ( the correlation coefficient is 0.86 ) than that between @xmath8(fir ) and @xmath8(@xmath6co ) .",
    "the correlation is poorer because the high-@xmath5 luminous starburst galaxies have lower @xmath7co luminosities than expected for galaxies with ordinary @xmath5 values ; note that the average value of @xmath45co)/@xmath8(fir ) is 0.00051 @xmath44 0.00034 for the high-@xmath5 galaxies while that for the normal galaxies is 0.0023 @xmath44 0.0017 .",
    "thus , we conclude that the higher @xmath5 in the luminous starburst mergers is mostly due not to enhanced @xmath6co emission but to depressed @xmath7co line intensities .",
    "an average @xmath5 value for the high-@xmath5 galaxies is @xmath46 .",
    "since lower - limit data are used in this estimate , we obtain a @xmath7co depression factor @xmath47 , given @xmath48 for the normal galaxies .",
    "any physical mechanism must explain the intrinsic weakness of @xmath7co(@xmath1 = 1  0 ) emission by a factor of @xmath47 in the luminous starburst mergers .",
    "here we investigate possible mechanisms that can explain the intrinsic weakness of @xmath7co(@xmath1 = 1  0 ) emission by a factor of @xmath47 in the luminous starburst mergers .",
    "high @xmath5 values may be caused by ( see also sakamoto et al .",
    "1997 ) : 1 ) low gas densities , 2 ) high gas kinetic temperatures , 3 ) large nuclear velocity gradients that keep co column densities small at a given velocity , 4 ) small co / h@xmath49 abundance ratios , 5 ) more efficient excitation of @xmath7co molecules toward upper levels ( e.g. , @xmath50 ) with respect to @xmath6co ones , or 6 ) large @xmath6co/@xmath7co abundance ratios .",
    "the first four mechanisms lead to lower opacity of the co lines .",
    "the first mechanism also introduces non - lte excitation , resulting in high @xmath5 values . since it is known that the luminous starburst mergers have a huge amount of dense gas ( @xmath51 ; solomon et al .",
    "1992 ; scoville , yun , & bryant 1997 ) , the first idea ( lower gas densities ) seems to be unlikely .",
    "starburst galaxies often have both high gas kinetic temperatures and particularly large velocity gradients ( turner , martin , & ho 1990 ; aalto et al . 1991 , 1995 ;",
    "devereux et al . 1994 ) .",
    "however , if these mechanisms were responsible for the higher @xmath5 values , we would find a @xmath6co excess with respect to @xmath7co .",
    "therefore the second and third idea are also ruled out . the smaller co / h@xmath49 abundance ratio ( i.e. , lower metallicity ) seems also to be unlikely for the luminous starburst mergers because the enhanced star - formation activity occurs in their nuclear regions where metal abundances are generally high ( e.g. , storchi - bergmann et al . 1996 ) .",
    "it is known that @xmath6co(@xmath1=32)/@xmath6co(@xmath1=10 ) ratios of starburst galaxies are often found to be higher than in normal galaxies ( e.g. , devereux et al . 1994 and references therein ) .",
    "if @xmath7co molecules in starburst mergers were excited more efficiently toward upper levels with respect to @xmath6co , we would observe high-@xmath5 values in higher rotational transitions .",
    "however , there is no such evidence ( taniguchi , ohyama , & sanders 1998 ) .",
    "therefore , the remaining possibility is that the @xmath6co/@xmath7co abundance ratios are systematically higher than those in normal galaxies . according to our result ( fig .",
    "3 ) , this should be achieved by a @xmath7co underabundance with respect to @xmath6co in the starburst mergers .",
