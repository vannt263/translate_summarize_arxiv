    "dark matter is at present one of the most exciting fields of particle physics and cosmology .",
    "recent investigations of the cmb ( maxima , boomerang , dasi ) together with large scale structure results fix the non - baryonic dark matter contribution to the mass of the universe to @xmath0 25@xmath1 , of which still up to 38@xmath1 could be hot ( neutrinos ) . with the early nucleosynthesis constraint of @xmath2= 0.04 , the overwhelming contribution would consist of dark energy .",
    "terrestrial direct dark matter search experiments just now are _ starting _ to enter into the range of sensitivity required , it we consider the neutralinos to be the candidate for cold dark matter .",
    "the situation is similar in the hot dark matter search . here",
    "double beta decay is the most sensitive means to look for an absolute neutrino mass scale .",
    "direct search for wimps can be done    \\(a ) by looking for the recoil nuclei in wimp- nucleus elastic scattering .",
    "the signal could be ionisation , phonons or light produced by the recoiling nucleus .",
    "the typical recoil energy is a few 100ev / gev wimp mass .",
    "\\(b ) by looking for the modulation of the wimp signal resulting from the seasonal variation of the earth s velocity against the wimp wind.    the expectation for neutralino elastic scattering cross sections and masses have been extensively analysed in many variants of susy models .",
    "[ fig : bedn - wp2000 ] represents the present situation .",
    "the susy predictions are from the msugra model @xcite and the mssm with relaxed unification conditions @xcite .",
    "[ fig : ell - new-01 - 11 ] shows the result of a study at post - lep benchmark points based again on the msugra @xcite .",
    "present experiments only just touch the border of the area predicted by the mssm .",
    "the experimental dama evidence for dark matter lies in an area , in which msugra models do not expect dark matter .",
    "they would require beyond - gut physics in this frame @xcite",
    ".    summarizing the present experimental status , present experiments and also future projects ( see @xcite ) can be categorized in two classes :    \\1 .",
    "sensitivity ( or sensitivity goal ) just for confirmation of dama .",
    "\\2 . sensitivity to enter deeply into the range of susy predictions .",
    "only very few experiments may become candidates for category 2 in a foreseeable future ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : bedn - wp2000],[fig : ell - new-01 - 11 ] , and as far as at present visible , of those only genius will have the chance to search for modulation , i.e. to check , like dama , positive evidence for a dark matter signal .",
    "the cryogenic experiments cdms , cresst and edelweiss operate at present with 600 g of detectors and less , after a decade of development .",
    "expansion to several tens of kg or better 100 kg as required for modulation search , is still a _ very _ large step .",
    "cdms has collected only 10.6kgd of data over this time ( in 1999 , since then not working ) , edelweiss only 4.53kgd .",
    "the superheated droplet detectors picasso / simple are working at present on a scale of 15 and 50 g detectors , respectively .",
    "zeplin and the very ambiguous and nice project drift are in the stage of prototype construction .",
    "the situation is different for genius , which is based on conventional techniques .",
    "if classifying the sugra models into more g@xmath3 - 2-friendly ( i , l , b , g , c , j ) and less g@xmath3 - 2-friendly models , according to @xcite , the former ones have good prospects to be detectable by lhc and/or a 1tev collider .",
    "genius could check not only the larger part of these ones , but in addition two of the less g@xmath3 - 2-friendly models ( e and f ) , which will be difficult to be probed by future colliders ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ell - new-01 - 11 ] ) .",
    "this demonstrates nicely the complementarity of collider and underground research .",
    "genius would already in a first step , with 100 kg of _ natural _ ge detectors , cover a significant part of the susy parameter space for prediction of neutralinos as cold dark matter ( figs .",
    "[ fig : bedn - wp2000],[fig : ell - new-01 - 11 ] ) . for this purpose",
    "the background in the energy range @xmath4kev has to be reduced to @xmath5 ( events / kgykev ) . at this level solar neutrinos as source of background",
    "are still negligible .",
    "of particular importance is to shield the detectors during production ( and transport ) to keep the background from spallation by cosmic rays sufficiently low ( for details see @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of genius for dark matter corresponds to that obtainable with a 1km@xmath6 amanda detector for _ indirect _ detection ( neutrinos from annihilation of neutralinos captured at the sun ) ( see @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly both experiments would probe different neutralino compositions : genius mainly gaugino - dominated neutralinos , amanda mainly neutralinos with comparable gaugino and higgsino components ( see fig.38 in @xcite ) .",
    "neutrinos could still play an important role as hot dark matter in the universe .",
    "recent results from cmb and lss measurements still allow for a sum of neutrino masses of @xmath7 4.4.ev . under the assumption that neutrinos are degenerate in mass , the common mass eigenvalue is , from   decay , @xmath81.4ev(90@xmath1 c.l . ) if the lma msw solution is realized in nature @xcite .",
    "new approaches and considerably enlarged experiments , will be required in future to fix the neutrino mass with higher accuracy .",
    "genius is probably the most straightforward and promising of them .",
    "as discussed @xcite it could probe with 1ton of enriched @xmath9 a scale of the effective neutrino mass down to 0.02ev .",
    "this means that with 100 kg of enriched @xmath9 , a scale down to 0.04ev could be investigated .",
    "as a first step of genius , a small test facility , genius - tf , is at present under installation in the gran sasso underground laboratory @xcite . with about 40 kg of natural ge detectors operated in liquid nitrogen , genius - tf could test the dama seasonal modulation signature for dark matter . up to summer 2001 ,",
    "already six 2.5 kg germanium detectors with an extreme low - level threshold of @xmath0500 ev have been produced .",
    "terrestrial dark matter experiments searching for cold dark matter only now are starting to enter into the range of susy predictions .",
    "genius and genius - tf could play a decisive role here , as also in fixing the contribution of neutrinos to hot dark matter .",
