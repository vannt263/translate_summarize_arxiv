    "such an estimation of sdos is sensitive to the definition of the fermi level , which is carefully derived at each temperature by the fermi cutoff in the valence band spectra for silver mounted on the sample holder in electrical connection with the sample and measured using identical experimental conditions .",

    "6(a ) indicates a deviation from such a behavior in the present case .",
    "the decrease in intensity at @xmath12 with the decrease in temperature may arise due to the disorder induced localization of the electronic states .",

    "6(b ) exhibits deviation from linearity .",
    "interestingly , the curvatures at the exponents of 0.5 and 2 are opposite indicating an intermediate exponent for the present system .",
    "the simulation of sdos as a function of @xmath23 with @xmath24 exhibits linear dependence with energy for all the temperatures studied ( see fig .",

    "most interestingly , in fig .",
    "6(c ) , all the data below 150 k superimpose exactly and correspond to the same energy scale , while the data at 300 k exhibit similar energy dependence with a different slope .",

    "although the probed lowest temperature is slightly above @xmath2 , the dip grows monotonically with the decrease in temperature - a large suppression of the spectral weight at the fermi level is observed at 10 k indicating relation of this dip to the superconducting gap . in order to estimate the energy gap in these spectral functions",

    "the experimental and calculated band structure results suggest significant hybridization between zr 4@xmath7 and b 2@xmath6 states leading to similar energy distribution of the pdos . here , the eigenstates are primarily constituted by the linear combination of the zr 4@xmath7 and b 2@xmath6 states .",
    "the antibonding bands possess large zr 4@xmath7 orbital character and appear in the unoccupied part of the electronic structure @xcite .",
    "the energy bands below @xmath12 forming the valence band are the bonding eigenstates consisting of dominant 2@xmath6 orbital character .",
    "the covalency between these states could be attributed to the large radial extension of the 4@xmath7 orbitals overlapping strongly with the neighboring states as also observed in other 4@xmath7 systems @xcite .",
    "the calculated results within the local density approximation are consistent with the experimental spectra - subtle differences between the experiment and theory could not be captured via inclusion of electron correlation and/or consideration of spin - orbit coupling in these lda calculations .",
    "the band structure results exhibit two important features - ( i ) the energy bands with @xmath1 symmetry are highly dispersive compared to @xmath8 bands and ( ii ) the crystal field splitting is negligible . as shown in fig .",
    "1 , the b@xmath0 dodecahedrons form an octahedra around zr sites with the center of mass of the b@xmath0 units at the edge centers of the unit cell .",
    "the size of the dodecahedrons are quite large with no boron situating on the unit cell edge .",
    "thus , the overlap of b 2@xmath6 orbitals with the @xmath1 orbitals is significantly enhanced due to the proximity of borons along the face diagonals , while that with the @xmath8 orbitals is reduced leading to a comparable crystal field potential on both the orbitals . the larger hybridization with the @xmath1 orbitals are also manifested by the large dispersion of the @xmath1 bands spanning across the fermi level while @xmath8 bands are relatively more localized . from these calculations ,",
    "the effective valency of zr was found to vary between ( + 2.4 ) to ( + 2.5 ) depending on the electron interaction parameters such as correlation strength , spin orbit coupling _",

    "the arrows show the fermi level crossings . ]",
    "the fermi level is located almost at the inflection points of each of the energy band crossing @xmath12 as shown in fig .",
    "this is verified by investigating the first derivative of the energy bands shown by the symbols in the figure .",
    "the arrows in the figure indicate fermi level crossing and corresponding point in the first derivative curves .",
    "evidently , the band crossing correspond to an extremum in the derivative plot . the inflection point is the point , where the curve changes its curvature that corresponds to a change in the character of the conduction electrons ( the fermi surface ) from hole - like to electron - like behavior .",
    "this behavior is termed as lifschitz transition @xcite .",
    "thus , this material appear to be lying in the proximity of the lifschitz transition as also observed in various exotic unconventional superconductors such as fe - pnictides @xcite . due to the lack of cleavage plane and hardness of the sample , the fermi surface mapping of this sample",
    "could not be carried out to verify this theoretical prediction experimentally .",
    "it is well known that the band structure calculations captures the features in the electronic structure well in the weakly correlated systems as also found in the present case suggesting possibility of such interesting phenomena in this system .",

    "this gap is significantly larger than the value predicted ( 1 - 2 mev ) considering bcs behavior .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath34 , which is a measure of single particle scattering rate , is quite large and found to decrease with the decrease in temperature . on the other hand , @xmath35",
    ", the inverse pair lifetime is found to be significant and smaller than 2@xmath27 suggesting proximity to a bcs limit for this system .",
    "@xmath28 exhibits temperature dependence quite similar to that of @xmath32 .",
    "the decrease in @xmath28 manifests gradual enhancement of the electron pair lifetime with the decrease in temperature that eventually leads to the superconducting phase upon attaining coherence among the pairs .",
    "thus , the temperature in the vicinity of 70 k exhibiting the onset of pair formation could be the critical temperature , @xmath36 in this system .",
    "the observation of the signature of an energy gap and finite electron pair lifetime above @xmath2 is quite similar to that observed for under - doped cuprates@xcite and is an indication of precursor effect in this system .",
    "clearly , the electronic structure of this system is complex , appears to be at the crossover of bcs and unconventional behaviors and further studies are required to understand the origin of pseudogap & unusual spectral lineshape .    in summary",

    "<S> we investigate the electronic structure of a complex conventional superconductor , zrb@xmath0 employing high resolution photoemission spectroscopy and _ ab initio _ band structure calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental valence band spectra could be described reasonably well within the local density approximation . </S>",
    "<S> energy bands close to the fermi level possess @xmath1 symmetry and the fermi level is found to be in the proximity of quantum fluctuation regime . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral lineshape in the high resolution spectra is complex exhibiting signature of a deviation from fermi liquid behavior . a dip at the fermi level emerges above the superconducting transition temperature that gradually grows with the decrease in temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral simulation of the dip and spectral lineshape based on a phenomenological self energy suggests finite electron pair lifetime and a pseudogap above the superconducting transition temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> the relationship between pseudogap phase and superconductivity in high temperature superconductors is an issue of discussion for many years now @xcite . while one school believes that the pseudogap arises due to some hidden order and/or effects not associated to superconductivity , the other school attributes pseudogap to the electron pair formation above the transition temperature , @xmath2 as a precursor to the superconducting gap that leads to superconductivity upon establishment of the coherence among the electron pairs at @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> independent of these differences , it is realized that electron correlation plays a significant role in the occurrence of pseudogap phase in these unconventional superconductors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> several questions are being asked on whether the pseudogap phase is specific to unconventional superconductors , electron correlation or low dimensionality is a necessity for such phase _ </S>",
    "<S> etc_.    . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) b@xmath0 units are contracted to visualize the isolated b@xmath0 clusters with better clarity . ]    </S>",
    "<S> apart from these issues , the quest of new superconducting compounds resulted into the discovery of new materials such as cubic hexane , @xmath3b@xmath4 @xcite and dodecaborides , @xmath3b@xmath0 ( @xmath3 = sc . </S>",
    "<S> y , zr , la , lu , th ) those attracted much attention due to their interesting electronic properties @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> zrb@xmath0 is one such compound exhibiting relatively high superconducting transition temperature of 6 k in the mb@xmath0 family @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it forms in cubic structure as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) , the real lattice positions are shown with the correct bond lengths and atom positions . </S>",
    "<S> although , the structure appears to be complex , it is essentially a rock salt structure constituted by two interpenetrated fcc lattices formed by zr and b@xmath0 units as demonstrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) by compressing the b@xmath0 units for clarity . </S>",
    "<S> various transport and magnetic measurements suggest a bardeen - cooper - schriefer ( bcs ) type superconductivity in this material , which is termed as conventional superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> since , zr atoms are located within the huge octahedral void space formed by the b@xmath0 units , the superconductivity in these materials could conveniently be explained by the electron - phonon coupling mediated phenomena involving primarily low energy phonon modes associated with the vibration of zr atoms @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the electronic properties of zrb@xmath0 manifest plethora of conflicts involving the mechanism of the transition . </S>",
    "<S> for example , there are conflicts on whether it is a type i or type ii superconductor @xcite , whether it possesses single gap @xcite or multiple gaps @xcite , _ etc . </S>",

    "<S> et al_. @xcite found that superfluid density of zrb@xmath0 exhibits unconventional temperature dependence with pronounced shoulder at @xmath5 0.65 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , they find different superconducting gap and transition temperatures for different energy bands , and the values of the order parameter obtained for @xmath6 and @xmath7 bands are 2.81 and 6.44 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> detailed magnetic measurements reveal signature of meissner , mixed and intermediate states at different temperatures and magnetic fields @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> some of these variances were attributed to surface - bulk differences in the electronic structure @xcite , the superconductivity at the sample surface @xcite _ etc_. evidently , the properties of zrb@xmath0 is complex despite exhibiting signatures of bcs type superconductivity . here , we probed the evolution of the electronic structure of zrb@xmath0 employing high resolution photoelectron spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental results exhibit spectral evolution anomalous to conventional type superconductor and signature of pseudogap prior to the onset of superconductivity . </S>"
