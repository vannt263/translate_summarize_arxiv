    "correlations between hadrons produced in jets in heavy - ion collisions have become a subject of intense study recently @xcite-@xcite .",
    "there are many ways to describe the nature of the correlations , some using triggers , others giving correlations without triggers .",
    "so far no clear understanding of the properties of dihadron correlations has emerged .",
    "satisfactory theoretical description of the problem is lagging even farther behind . in this paper",
    "we offer a theoretical view of some aspect of the correlations among partons and hadrons in connection with jets .",
    "because we treat only a limited aspect of the dihadron distributions ( notably only @xmath4 correlation ) , we can not make exhaustive comparisons with the data that have their own limitations , such as the lack of particle identification in many cases .",
    "nevertheless , our results illuminate some important features of the nature of the correlations .    for experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic )",
    "the relevant range of transverse momenta ( @xmath0 ) of the detected hadrons in which the correlations are probed is between 0.5 and 9 gev / c . since no calculation from first principles is reliable in the intermediate @xmath0 range , any theoretical treatment of correlations",
    "can only be done in the framework of some phenomenological model .",
    "the parton recombination model has been successful in describing the single - particle inclusive distributions in au+au @xcite as well as d+au collisions @xcite .",
    "indeed , it has already been applied to the study of some aspects of dihadron correlations @xcite .",
    "we shall extend that study and examine in more detail various features of the correlations , not only among the produced hadrons , but also among the partons before they hadronize .",
    "there are limitations to what we can do here .",
    "we shall continue to use the one - dimensional ( 1d ) formulation of parton recombination , which offers a transparent display in analytical forms the various components that contribute to dihadron correlations , without any thing hidden in an elaborate code .",
    "focusing only on the @xmath0 variable in the 1d treatment means that we can not consider the dependencies on the pseudorapidity @xmath5 and azimuthal angle @xmath6 separations between the two detected hadrons .",
    "that shortcoming will be overcome in a separate investigation .",
    "but by not being distracted by the behavior in @xmath7 and @xmath8 variables , we can examine more closely the separate roles that thermal and shower partons play in the correlation problem , when only the collinear momenta are considered .",
    "experimentally , they correspond to the magnitudes of the associated particle momenta . even with that simplification we have not considered all charged particles , which are what the experiments measure without particle identification . to gain",
    "an overview of the general properties of the correlation functions , the hadron pair @xmath4 is sufficient and more transparent in providing a rich display of various features .",
    "our basic assumption in this work is that the shower partons are emitted independently in a jet except for the momentum constraint that the sum of the momentum fractions of all partons can not exceed 1 .",
    "this assumption is only a working hypothesis in this study and is a reasonable starting point of our investigation of correlations in order to form a base line , from which the effect of dynamical correlation can be differentiated in the future .",
    "whatever hadronic correlation that we shall calculate in this paper therefore follows from the kinematical correlation of the shower partons in a jet .",
    "the dynamical independence of the shower partons may perhaps be approximately correct at small momentum fractions where many shower partons are likely to be present . at larger momentum fractions",
    "the kinematical constraint is important and is suitably taken into account .",
    "since the distributions of the shower partons have been determined from the fragmentation functions ( ffs ) with the same assumption of dynamical independence @xcite , we are in that respect merely being self - consistent in our study of their correlation here . since the single - particle distributions that we have calculated using those distributions of the shower partons are in good agreement with the data @xcite , there is indirect evidence that our assumption may not be too far from reality .",
    "furthermore , another test of the reliability of the shower parton distributions ( spds ) has been carried out in @xcite , where the fragmentations of @xmath9 and @xmath10 quarks to @xmath11 have been calculated using the spds for recombination into a proton or antiproton .",
    "the resultant ffs agree with the parametrization of kkp @xcite over 4 orders of magnitude within a factor of 2 , which is roughly the margin of error made in the kkp parametrization of the data on @xmath11 production @xcite . because of that error in @xcite , the work on the proton ff is not included in @xcite , but it is nevertheless a demonstration that the assumption of independent shower partons except for kinematical constraint can lead to sensible result in the calculation of the proton ff , which has not been done in any other approach to hadronization , as far as we know . in this paper",
    "we continue to use that assumption to calculate the hadronic correlations in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "we shall first examine the single - particle distributions for au+au collisions at all centralities .",
    "the parameters determined can then be used for subsequent studies of correlations among partons and hadrons . in sec .",
    "3 the correlation among the shower partons is calculated both for jets in vacuum and for jets produced in heavy - ion collisions ( hic ) .",
    "they behave quite differently",
    ". then we study in sec .",
    "4 the correlation among hadrons , for which the role of thermal partons becomes important in central collisions , but not as much in peripheral collisions . in sec .",
    "5 our results are compared with existing experimental data in areas where such comparisons are possible .",
    "in @xcite the single - particle distribution of hadrons produced in au+au collisions at 200 gev is studied for 0 - 10% centrality only .",
    "we now complete the picture by considering all other centralities , thereby determining the corresponding parameters for the thermal partons and the value of @xmath12 that describes the average number of hard partons emerging from the dense medium to hadronize .",
    "this also gives us the opportunity to reiterate the basic equations for parton recombination .",
    "the invariant inclusive distribution for a produced meson with momentum @xmath13 is @xcite @xmath14 where the recombination function ( rf ) for a pion is @xcite @xmath15 the distribution for two partons , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , that are to recombine has three components @xmath18 where the thermal parton distribution is @xmath19 and the shower parton in @xmath20 has the distribution @xmath21 whereas the two shower partons in the same jet @xmath22 have the correlated distribution @xmath23 @xmath24 .",
    "\\label{7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the distribution @xmath25 of hard parton @xmath26 at midrapidity in au+au collisions is given in @xcite .",
    "the integral over @xmath27 is from @xmath28 gev / c to an upper limit which we shall set at 40 gev / c .",
    "@xmath29 is a matrix of shower parton distributions ( spd ) that have been determined in @xcite .",
    "the form of the two spds , given in eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) , symmetrizes the order of emission and guarantees the momentum conservation condition @xmath30 , apart from which the shower partons are assumed to be independent .",
    "thus the correlation between the partons is essentially kinematical , as it is treated here , although other correlations of more dynamical origin can be considered later when the need arises .",
    "the shower partons can either recombine among themselves , or recombine with the thermal partons . in the former case",
    "the process reproduces the ff @xmath31 indeed , this is the equation from which the spds are determined in the first place @xcite .",
    "thus the @xmath32 term in eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) , when substituted into eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) , yields the fragmentation component @xmath33 note that because the two shower partons are from the same jet , eq .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) depends linearly on @xmath34 , which is the same dependence that the @xmath20 component has . hence , when all three terms in @xmath35 and the rf @xmath36 are substituted into eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) , we have , in the notation @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "\\label{10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is the basic formula for the inclusive distribution of pion . the hard parton @xmath26 is summed over all relevant species , while @xmath16 is summed over the two possible constituent quark species of the pion .",
    "the quark @xmath16 picks up a partner from the thermal environment to form the pion . that @xmath20 component turns out to be dominant in the intermediate @xmath0 region ( @xmath39 gev / c ) in central au+au collisions , and is responsible for the high @xmath40 ratio , when the production of proton is considered in a similar way @xcite .",
    "we now apply eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) to non - central au+au collisions .",
    "the hard parton distribution @xmath25 is scaled down from central collisions by the average number of binary collisions @xmath41 .",
    "our procedure is to fit the low-@xmath0 data ( for @xmath42 gev / c ) by the first term that arises from @xmath43 recombination , thereby determining @xmath44 and @xmath45 for each centrality .",
    "the only remaining parameter , @xmath12 , is then determined by the overall normalization of the spectrum at each centrality so that the shape of the large @xmath0 dependence is a prediction of eq.([10 ] ) .",
    "the data used are the @xmath46 spectra from phenix that extend up to @xmath47 gev / c @xcite .",
    "we , however , calculate the @xmath48 distribution with @xmath49 and @xmath50 , since our formalism does not distinguish the two .",
    "figure 1 shows the result of our calculation for four representative centralities , although we have treated all nine centralities , for which the parameters are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "evidently , the spectra are well fitted at all centralities .",
    "the inverse slope @xmath45 shows no significant dependence on centrality ; the common value may be set at @xmath51 the value of @xmath12 increases from 0.09 at 0 - 10% to 0.97 at 80 - 92% centrality .",
    "thus au+au collision at 80 - 92% is essentially equivalent to @xmath52 collision , since the suppression factor due to energy loss is nearly 1 , i.e. , no jet quenching .",
    "the value of @xmath44 decreases from 21.8 ( gev / c)@xmath53 at 0 - 10% to 2.3 ( gev / c)@xmath53 at 80 - 92% . the thermal component in peripheral collision is therefore much reduced , as expected .",
    "the contributions from the various components are shown in fig .  3 for 0 - 10% and 80 - 92% centralities .",
    "it is clear that at 0 - 10% the component from thermal - shower recombination is dominant in the @xmath54 gev / c range , but at 80 - 92% that component is lower than both thermal - thermal and shower - shower components .",
    "indeed , @xmath32 dominates for all @xmath55",
    "gev / c ; it means that the fragmentation model is quite adequate for @xmath52 collisions in that @xmath0 range .",
    "before we consider the correlation between hadrons produced in jets , let us first study the simpler problem of correlation between partons in jets .",
    "although the latter is not measurable , it provides a striking view of the difference between jets produced in vacuum , as in @xmath56 annihilation , and jets produced in hic where the hard parton momentum is not fixed .    to define our notation ,",

    "( [ 17 ] ) is to be identified with eq.([7 ] ) . for definiteness",
    "we consider @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "for @xmath70 we get for @xmath71 a 2d distribution as shown in fig .  4 . other distributions with @xmath72 or @xmath50 are very similar .",
    "since @xmath73 implies no correlation , we see from fig .  4 that the two shower partons are uncorrelated when @xmath74 , but are highly correlated at higher @xmath75 .",
    "kinematical constraint due to momentum conservation forces @xmath71 to vanish at @xmath76 .",
    "it approaches zero faster , as @xmath77 , than it does when @xmath65 is fixed and small , as @xmath78 .",
    "the implication is that if these two partons are to recombine to form a pion at @xmath79 , there is more contribution from the asymmetric pairing of @xmath64 and @xmath65 than from the unnecessarily stringent requirement that @xmath80 .      for each event in hic with a high @xmath0 jet",
    ", we can calculate the two - parton distribution as above .",
    "however , the hard parton momentum @xmath27 can not be fixed in an experiment . the distribution in the shower parton momenta @xmath81 and @xmath82 , when averaged over all events , necessitates an integration over @xmath27 and a sum over all @xmath26 .",
    "the single - parton distribution @xmath83 is given by eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) , while the two - parton distribution @xmath84 is given by eqs .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) and ( [ 7 ] ) .",
    "some details in the calculation need to be explained . when @xmath26 in eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) is @xmath85 , then @xmath86 , but when @xmath72 , say , then @xmath87 , where @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are spds initiated by gluon , valence quark and sea quark , respectively , in the notation of @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the gross features of the results do not depend sensitively on these details .    for au+au collisions at 200 gev",
    "we have calculated @xmath91 .",
    "the results for most central and most peripheral collisions are shown in fig .",
    "the main feature is that @xmath91 is large and increases with @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "that is markedly different from fig .",
    "the reason is that @xmath92 depends quadratically on @xmath93 , whereas @xmath94 depends on it linearly .",
    "the probability @xmath93 for a hard parton to be produced at @xmath27 in hic is small in central collisions , and is even smaller in peripheral collisions ( although @xmath12 is larger ) because @xmath25 scales with @xmath95 .",
    "thus the probability of producing two partons in a jet is much higher than the product of the probabilities of producing the two partons separately .",
    "the latter does not require the two partons to be produced in two jets in the same event . for experiments at rhic we may assume that events with two jets in the same hemisphere never occur , since they are so rare .",
    "another way of interpreting @xmath91 is to write it as @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the conditional probability of finding a parton at @xmath82 given that a parton is at @xmath81 @xmath98 thus @xmath99 is like the distribution of a particle associated with a trigger at @xmath81 .",
    "the largeness of the ratio in eq .",
    "( [ 20 ] ) means that it is far more likely for a shower parton to be found at @xmath82 in association with another parton already found at @xmath81 than to find a parton at @xmath82 independently .",
    "the two surfaces in fig .",
    "5 have essentially the same shape . the peripheral case is higher because the corresponding @xmath100 is smaller . in fig .",
    "4 the hard parton momentum @xmath27 is held fixed and the probability of having such a parton is 1 , while in fig .",
    "5 @xmath27 is integrated up to 40 gev / c so that at higher @xmath81 and @xmath82 there is no kinematical cut - off , albeit the probability @xmath25 of producing a hard parton at higher @xmath27 is greatly suppressed , which only makes @xmath101 higher .",
    "the study in this section may seem academic , since shower partons are not directly observable .",
    "however , those shower partons are the main constituents that contribute to the formation of pions that we shall treat in the following section .",
    "their properties are therefore important to help us understand the features that we shall find about dihardron correlations .",
    "it should be emphasized that no free parameters have been used in this section , or in the section to follow , apart from @xmath102 that have been determined in sec .  2 for the single - particle distributions .",
    "for the production of two pions it is necessary to consider the recombination of four partons .",
    "the corresponding equation for the two - pion distribution is @xcite @xmath103 the partons with momenta @xmath81 and @xmath104 that form @xmath105 can be either thermal or shower , as in eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "similarly , the same is true with @xmath82 and @xmath106 .",
    "thus @xmath107 has the form @xmath108 among the various possible combinations of terms , it is clear that @xmath109 has nothing to do with hard scattering and contributes to the background . for that reason",
    "the terms involving @xmath110 are not included in @xcite , where the background - subtracted distributions of the associated particles are considered . here",
    "we study @xmath111 , which has its own definition of subtraction , so we start out being general . despite the deceptive appearance of eq.([23 ] ) , @xmath107 is not factorizable . if it were , its substitution into eq .",
    "( [ 22 ] ) would render the factorizable form @xmath112 , implying no correlation .",
    "the nonfactorizability of @xmath107 is rooted in the correlations among the various shower partons .",
    "the correlation between two shower partons in @xmath113 or @xmath114 has already been considered in connection with eq .",
    "( [ 19 ] ) , which is shown explicitly in eqs .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) and ( [ 7 ] ) .",
    "however , those are not the correlations that render @xmath107 nonfactorizable .",
    "it is the correlation between the partons in @xmath115 with the partons in @xmath116 that gives rise to nonvanishing @xmath117 .",
    "more specifically , because all shower partons in eq .",
    "( [ 23 ] ) originate from the same hard parton at @xmath27 , there is only one @xmath93 factor for all @xmath118 terms .",
    "thus , for example , in @xmath119 the @xmath120 term is exactly as expressed in eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) . in @xmath121",
    "we can append @xmath122 and make use of eq .",

    "then the sum in @xmath16 is over @xmath9 and @xmath50 . if @xmath70 , then @xmath128 ; if @xmath129 ( @xmath9 or @xmath50 ) , then @xmath130 or @xmath131 where @xmath132 denotes sea ; if @xmath133 , then @xmath134 also .    for completeness ,",
    "let us write out the two other combinations of terms .",
    "for @xmath119 we have @xmath135 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 can be either @xmath9 or @xmath50 .",
    "for @xmath136 we have @xmath137 in all three equations above @xmath138 and @xmath139 follow the same rule stated at the end of the previous paragraph . for simplicity",

    "the parentheses imply the contents are to recombine ; the square brackets signify that the shower partons inside all arise from one hard - parton jet .",
    "it is appropriate at this point to compare our description of two - particle distributions with the correlation study of fries _ et al _ ( fbm ) @xcite .",
    "since both approaches are based on the recombination model @xcite , there are many similarities , particularly in the separation into various components . apart from the difference in focus where we consider correlation in @xmath0 ,",
    "while fbm studies correlation in @xmath143 , the main difference in physics is that we break the hard parton into shower partons , whereas fbm does not . if our @xmath144 recombination is related qualitatively to their soft - hard ( sh ) recombination , then the classification of components is essentially the same in the two approaches .",
    "quantitatively , @xmath144 can be significantly different from sh .",
    "moreover , the correlation at the parton level is for us among the shower partons , while for fbm among the soft partons .    in @xmath58",
    "the @xmath145 term is factorizable , and is cancelled by the thermal terms in @xmath146 , where @xmath57 is given by eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "that corresponds to background subtraction .",
    "other double @xmath43 terms like @xmath147 also get cancelled .",
    "the surviving terms in @xmath117 all involve shower partons in each pion . we group them in four clusters of terms @xmath148 where @xmath149_{12 } - ( { \\cal st})_1 * ( { \\cal st})_2 \\label{28}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath150_{12 } - ( { \\cal st})_1 * ( { \\cal d})_2 \\label{29}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath151_{12 } - ( { \\cal d})_1 * ( { \\cal st})_2   \\label{30}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath152_{12 } - ( { \\cal d})_1 * ( { \\cal d})_2   \\quad . \\label{31}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the products involving @xmath153 signify terms from @xmath154 , so their shower partons have their own hard partons .",

    "there is still a dip at @xmath188 gev / c with @xmath189 in its vicinity , as it should , but for 80 - 92% centrality @xmath187 decreases monotonically with increasing @xmath13 .",
    "the normalizations of @xmath187 for the two cases are now nearly the same . that can be seen more easily in semi - log plots . in fig .",

    "that difference can be succinctly exhibited in the ratio @xmath196 which is shown in fig .",
    "since peripheral au+au collisions at 80 - 92% centrality is very close to @xmath52 collisions , we may regard fig .",
    "10(b ) as the clearest revelation of the difference in dihadron correlation between central au+au and @xmath52 collisions .",

    "6 where @xmath169 is negative at @xmath197 gev / c for 0 - 10% centrality , but not for 80 - 92% centrality .",
    "let us now describe the reasons why @xmath198 are negative in fig .",
    "6(a ) , but not in fig .",
    "many factors are involved with competing strengths that can be compared only by concrete calculation , but qualitative discussion can provide some insight . consider eq .",
    "( [ 28 ] ) whose two terms are shown explicitly in eqs .",
    "( [ 25 ] ) and ( [ 32 ] ) .",
    "the former has one factor of @xmath34 and two spds sharing the same @xmath27 , while the latter has two independent factors of @xmath34 , each having only one spd . in the peripheral case",
    "@xmath34 is very small because @xmath25 is scaled down by @xmath199 , so @xmath200 is always small compared to @xmath141_{12}$ ] at all @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "hence , @xmath201 is always positive ; the same argument applies to all other @xmath202 . in the case of central collisions",
    "@xmath34 becomes large enough to allow other factors to also play some role .",
    "when @xmath163 and @xmath164 are on the lower end of the intermediate range , e.g. @xmath203 gev / c , @xmath81 and @xmath82 must be even less , but not too small because @xmath204 and @xmath205 would be exponentially damped at large @xmath206 .",
    "in other words , if the momentum fraction @xmath75 of the shower partons are small , there are not many thermal partons to make up @xmath163 and @xmath164 ; on the other hand , if @xmath75 are large , the spds are suppressed .",
    "the hard parton @xmath27 can not be large to relieve the latter constraint without suffering the suppression of @xmath25 .",
    "this situation of multiple constraints is easier for @xmath200 to meet since there is only one shower parton per jet in eq .",
    "( [ 32 ] ) , but is much more difficult for @xmath141_{12}$ ] where the jet momentum must be shared by two shower partons .",
    "thus @xmath141_{12}$ ] is forced to be smaller than @xmath200 in central collisions where @xmath34 is not infinitesimal and thermal partons are important in the intermediate @xmath0 region .    in the case of @xmath161",
    "there is no @xmath207 , but the demand for additional shower partons plays the same role .",
    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ 31 ] ) that double fragmentation causes @xmath208_{12}$ ] to be more suppressed than two single fragmentation @xmath209 .",
    "thus @xmath161 becomes negative so long as @xmath163 and @xmath164 are not high enough to force the large @xmath27 to dampen double @xmath34 in @xmath209 more severely than the single @xmath34 in @xmath208_{12}$ ] .",
    "the other @xmath198 terms behave similarly for the same reason , resulting in the sum @xmath111 to be negative when @xmath163 and @xmath164 are both less than around 3 gev / c .",
    "the negativity of @xmath111 should not be surprising , since the ratio @xmath91 for the shower partons in a jet of fixed @xmath27 is less than 1 , as shown in fig .  4 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath111 is negative for all @xmath64 and @xmath65 . in the hadronic problem",
    "there are in some terms even more shower partons involved , all competing for the limited momentum that the hard parton provides .",
    "10 exhibits the intricacies of the hadronic correlation even when the basic correlations among the shower partons are kinematical in nature .",
    "in the foregoing we have studied the correlation of two @xmath48 without using any adjustable parameters . what we have obtained unfortunately",
    "can not be compared directly with current data , because most experiments either do not yet have particle identification , or put emphasis on jets with trigger particles and study the dependencies on @xmath210 and @xmath211 of associated particles .",
    "there are , however , two areas in which our theoretical calculations come close to the experimental data and are of interest for us to examine them in more detail here .    the first area concerns the experiment in @xcite , in which data are given for the @xmath0 distribution of charged particles associated with trigger in the range @xmath212 gev / c .",
    "we can come close to what is measured by calculating @xmath213 where @xmath163 is regarded as the momentum of the trigger particle , and @xmath164 that of the associated particle .",
    "the superscript , @xmath214 , denotes the sample of triggered events with background subtracted . for the integrand in the numerator we use eq.([22 ] ) , but with @xmath107 not given by eq .",
    "( [ 23 ] ) .",
    "background subtraction corresponds in our case to leaving out in eq.([23 ] ) the terms that are factorizable .",
    "we are uncertain whether that correspondence is exact , since the experimental procedure for the determination of the background is not unique and involves steps that seem hard to duplicate in theoretical calculation .",
    "our procedure of retaining only the non - factorizable component is the most sensible way to obtain the associated particle distribution , so we use @xmath215 which is not factorizable because of the correlation that exists between the shower parton at @xmath81 and the shower parton at @xmath82 , as we have studied in sec .  3 .",
    "we note that eq .",
    "( [ 35 ] ) is a ratio of the integrals over the trigger momentum in contrast to the integral of the ratio that is calculated in @xcite .",
    "( [ 35 ] ) corresponds to the way that the data are presented in @xcite .",
    "there is one piece of detail about the calculation using eqs.([22 ] ) and ( [ 36 ] ) that we now discuss . among the spds determined in @xcite the gluon initiated quark distribution",
    "has a parametrization that leads to divergence , @xmath216 , as the momentum fraction @xmath217 .",
    "it is unphysical in that limit , although the parametrization renders a good fit of the fragmentation function away from that limit . in application to the calculation of @xmath218 , as in eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) , the integral over @xmath81 is convergent , and at small @xmath13 the @xmath219 component is dominated by the @xmath220 component .",
    "but when the background is subtracted with the @xmath221 component removed from @xmath222 , the effect of large @xmath223 at very small @xmath224 is exposed .",
    "since that effect is unphysical and since we do not claim reliability of our formalism at very small @xmath0 , we introduce an _ ad hoc _",
    "factor @xmath225 to suppress the distribution at small @xmath226 for all gluon initiated shower partons . with @xmath227",
    "set at 1 gev / c this procedure does not affect the results of our calculation for @xmath228 gev / c , but does introduce a round - off at lower @xmath0 in the associated particle distribution .",
    "figures in sec .",
    "4 all have that factor @xmath229 included for gluon initiated showers .    substituting eq .",
    "( [ 36 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ 22 ] ) and then into eq.([35 ] ) , we obtain the results shown in fig .  11 for ( a ) 0 - 10% and ( b ) 80 - 92% centralities .",
    "the calculated curves are for @xmath48 trigger and @xmath48 associated particle , while the data points from @xcite are for all charged particles with 0 - 5% centrality in ( a ) and for @xmath52 collision in ( b ) .",
    "the shapes of the @xmath0 dependence agree very well ; the normalizations differ by a factor that can be attributed to the data being for all charged particles .",
    "thus our formalism describes the correlation between particles in jets quite satisfactorily when compared to data .",
    "another area of possible comparison between theory and experiment is in correlation at low @xmath0 .",
    "data on a quantity denoted by @xmath230 in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath52 collision show a bulge plotted in transverse rapidity , defined by @xmath231 .",
    "\\label{38}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the quantity @xmath230 is rather similar to our @xmath185 , it is of interest to display the latter in terms of @xmath232 , which has the virtue of expanding the low @xmath0 scale . since our calculations are unreliable for @xmath233 gev / c , we consider only the region @xmath234 . instead of eq .",
    "( [ 12a ] ) , we now define @xmath235 where @xmath236 . @xmath111 and @xmath185 remain to be defined by eqs .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) and ( [ 15 ] ) , respectively , but in terms of @xmath237 and @xmath238 they are changed in accordance to eq.([39 ] ) .    in fig .",
    "12 we show @xmath185 as functions of @xmath237 and @xmath238 for ( a ) 80 - 92% and ( b ) 0 - 10% centralities .",
    "they are reproductions of the two surfaces in fig .",
    "10(a ) , now in terms of @xmath239 .",
    "the upper ones in both are for peripheral collisions , while the lower ones are for central collisions .",
    "the increase at small @xmath237 and @xmath238 in fig .",
    "12(a ) appears to agree with the bulge in the @xmath52 collision data in @xcite for @xmath240 .",
    "for central collision fig .",
    "12(b ) has a peak and a dip , which are predictions that should be checked by the analysis of the corresponding data . for completeness , we show in fig .  13 the @xmath241 in the @xmath242 variables , in terms of which",
    "the dip becomes the dominant feature , even more prominent than in fig .",
    "we have calculated the single - particle distribution in au+au collisions at all centralities , and considered various types of correlation functions in jets . for correlations between shower partons we have shown the drastic difference between the case when the hard parton momentum @xmath27 is fixed , as in @xmath56 annihilation , and the case in heavy - ion collisions where @xmath27 is not fixed . for hadron correlations we have considered three types of correlation fucntions , @xmath117 , @xmath180 , and @xmath195 , and showed that @xmath195 is best in displaying the structure of the dihadron correlation .",
    "we have found that the ratio of @xmath195 for central collisions to that for peripheral collisions has a big dip in the @xmath243 gev / c region .",
    "that is where the negative correlation between shower partons in a jet pulls down the hadronic @xmath244 in central au+au collisions relative to @xmath92 .",
    "however , in peripheral collisions @xmath92 is so small compared to @xmath244 that @xmath111 remains positive for all @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "the calculated features of @xmath195 can be checked by experiment , since all the quantities involved are directly measurable .",
    "although most of the results obtained on the correlation functions can not be compared with any existing data , there is no basic hurdle to overcome for the data analysis to be carried out in ways that can check our prediction .",
    "the distribution of associated particles that we have calculated for @xmath4 correlation compares satisfactorily with the data except for the normalization difference due to the fact that the data are for all charged particles .",
    "our result on @xmath191 for peripheral collisions has some resemblance to the data on @xmath52 collisions , which are , however , not presented in a way that can facilitate quantitative comparison .",
    "clearly , closer coordination between theoretical and experimental efforts would be of great value to both .    in this work",
    "the basic quantity is the correlation function @xmath173 that is precisely defined . by subtracting @xmath92 from @xmath245 , not only",
    "is the background subtracted , other factorizable terms are taken out too , creating the possibility that @xmath117 can become negative .",
    "that possibility does not show up in the present experimental way of determining the associated particle distribution @xcite , but may be present in other ways of studying correlations @xcite .",
    "we suggest that future experimental work be directed toward determining the correlation function @xmath195 and the central - to - peripheral ratio @xmath246",
    ". the absence of any hole in the experimental result on @xmath246 , as shown in figs.10(b ) and 13 , would provide valuable information on the nature of parton correlation that we have not incorporated in our formulation of the problem .",
