    "in this work we focus on the efficiency limits of crystalline silicon ( c - si ) solar cells . in this regard , we consider both ideal devices ( perfect material and interfaces ) , as well as more realistic conditions , including defect - related recombinations , parasitic losses , and non - optimal light management .",
    "it is currently possible to fabricate c - si solar cells with absorber thickness values that differ by two orders of magnitude . on the one end of the thickness range",
    "there are conventional wafer - based c - si solar cells with the absorber thickness of the order of a few hundreds of micrometers @xcite .",
    "epitaxial growth allows fabricating solar cells with the thickness of a few tens of micrometers @xcite .",
    "finally , epitaxy - free fabrication@xcite makes possible fabricating c - si solar cells with the absorbing layer as thin as @xmath0 . for a proper design strategy ,",
    "it is important to determine the optimal absorber thickness in terms of the energy conversion efficiency .",
    "we address this question using a model single - junction silicon solar cell",
    ".    it is well know that reducing the silicon thickness leads to the reduction of total absorption , and thus of the photocurrent .",
    "this has to be compensated by implementing an appropriate light - trapping scheme .",
    "yet , it should be emphasized that even when the optimal light trapping is applied ( i.e. , perfect anti - reflection action combined with a lambertian scatterer ) , the maximum achievable absorption still decreases with decreasing material thickness @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath3 generally tends to decrease with increasing thickness . for a given material quality",
    ", this leads to an optimal thickness that maximizes the conversion efficiency @xcite . in this context , the goal of this work is twofold : first , to establish the most suitable thickness range for c - si solar cells to approach the efficiency limits .",
    "second , to identify the parameters that have to be improved in order to increase the energy conversion efficiency beyond the current record of 25.6% @xcite .",
    "we use efficiency as a figure of merit to assess different solar cell structures .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that the cost of electricity is mainly determined by the efficiency rather than by the cost of the active material ( which , in the case of silicon , is constantly decreasing ) . in this regard , it is particularly important to estimate the optimal absorber thickness range that maximizes the efficiency . in our analysis",
    "we include intrinsic auger recombination , as well as defect - based bulk and surface recombination mechanisms .",
    "we also introduce a simple approach that allows us to consider parasitic losses .",
    "we compare our results with the measured performance of state - of - the - art silicon solar cells , showing the room for improvement in terms of current , voltage , and fill factor .",
    "we pay particular attention to parasitic losses , which we believe are a major roadblock in reaching efficiency above the current record of 25.6% @xcite .",
    "a review of the efficiency limits of silicon solar cells is given in ref .",
    "the limits reported in the literature @xcite are usually calculated using the idealized diode equation @xcite .",
    "this approach has the following limitations :    1 .",
    "the diode equation gives less accurate results when the cell thickness is decreasing .",
    "we attribute this inaccuracy to the assumptions underlying the treatment of the space - charge region ( scr ) in the idealized diode formalism . in practice",
    ", idealized diode equation tends to significantly overestimate efficiency for thin cells .",
    "we further discuss the accuracy of the results obtained using the idealized diode equation in the appendix .",
    "solar cells require selective contacts , which can be achieved using a @xmath4-@xmath5 junction . yet ,",
    "the junction is not explicitly considered in the ideal diode approach .",
    "therefore , ideal diode equation gives unrealistic results that overestimate efficiency for undoped silicon .    in our approach",
    ", we calculate the efficiency limits overcoming these limitations : we analytically obtain the photogeneration rate ( ranging from double - pass absorption to lambertian light trapping ) , explicitly consider a @xmath4-@xmath5 junction , and numerically solve the drift - diffusion equations .",

    "the dashed lines are calculated assuming a constant doping @xmath12 , which is the optimal doping for the optimal absorber thickness equal to @xmath16 .",
    "the optimal base doping is highest for thinner cells ( reaching @xmath17 for the @xmath0 thick cell ) and decreases with increasing thickness .",
    "the maximum efficiency is equal to @xmath18 , and it is obtained for the @xmath16 thick cell . this is lower than the efficiency limit of 29.43%",
    "reported recently in the literature @xcite .",
    "the main reason is that in our calculations , the base doping increases auger losses and therefore reduces the efficiency . in the contrary ,",
    "the limit reported in the literature has been obtained using the idealized diode equation and assuming undoped silicon , as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] and in the appendix .",
    "we note that the efficiency as a function of the absorber thickness has a broad maximum , and even a small change in the input parameters can substantially shift the nominal optimal thickness . in the range between 40 and @xmath1 ,",
    "the calculated efficiency differs by no more than @xmath19 ( relative units ) from @xmath20 .",
    "this somehow arbitrary interval shows that for thickness values that differ considerably ( by one order of magnitude ) , the maximum achievable efficiency is very similar .",

    "@xcite , which are obtained using the idealized diode equation . in the case of the diode equation",
    ", solar cells approach the limiting efficiency for a practically undoped silicon . yet , in our calculations we can see a clear maximum around @xmath23 ( for the thickness range around 100  @xmath24 )",
    ". then , efficiency decreases with decreasing doping .",
    "this difference is due to the fact that the junction is not explicitly considered in the ideal diode approach .",
    "therefore , the requirement of selective contacts , which can be achieved using a @xmath4-@xmath5 junction , is not included .",
    "this leads to unrealistic results for very lightly doped materials .    for the simplicity of the analysis , in the rest of this paper we assume the constant base doping @xmath12",
    "in the calculations above we have assumed a lambertian light trapping , which is often taken as a benchmark in the optical design of solar cells . yet , it is difficult to fulfil this assumption in realistic devices",
    ". therefore , let us now focus on the role of light trapping in achieving the efficiency limits .",
    "to do so , we consider solar cells with incomplete light trapping : the photogeneration rate is taken as a weighted average of the photogeneration @xmath25 corresponding to the double - pass absorption ( i.e. , unstructured cell ) and the photogeneration @xmath26 corresponding to the lambertian limit .",
    "@xmath25 is calculated as    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the absorption coefficient of c - si @xcite .",
    "as previously , also in the double - pass case we assume a perfect back reflector and anti - reflection action .",
    "we note that there are no interference effects included in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gg_2p ] ) .",
    "when we consider single wavelengths , the interference effects are profound . yet , when we integrate the photogeneration rate over solar spectrum , the interference peaks are smeared out , which justifies the approximation used in eq .",

    "@xmath33 is a function of depth @xmath34 .",

    "[ fig : fig4](a ) we demonstrate that light trapping increases the maximum achievable efficiency .",
    "this is not the case for semiconductors with a direct energy band - gap , like gaas , where surface texturing does not increase the maximum efficiency  @xcite .",
    "therefore , for silicon solar cells light trapping is an essential element required to approach the efficiency limits , even for very thick cells",
    ".    as expected , light trapping significantly increases @xmath11 , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](b ) .",
    "@xmath11 for the thickest cells does not saturate because of the small absorption below the energy band - gap",
    ". moreover , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](c ) shows that light trapping also slightly improves @xmath3 . yet , this effect is appreciable only for cell thicknesses below @xmath37 , that is in a thickness range which is not particularly promising for achieving high efficiency .",
    "@xmath3 as a function of the thickness for the double - pass case exhibits a gentle maximum",
    ". this may be partly because the base doping is not optimized for thin cells .",
    "although the importance of light trapping for maximizing the conversion efficiency of c - si solar cells is well known , the present results allow to quantify the effects of incomplete light trapping on the efficiency .",
    "moreover , eq .  ( [ eq : phgen ] ) represents a simple model that can be also used to study the effects of parasitic losses , which are different from the effects related to incomplete light trapping .",
    "we shall discuss it in more details in the next section .",
    "so far , we have considered an idealized material , and therefore the cell performance was limited by intrinsic auger recombination .",
    "let us now consider extrinsic losses related to defect - base srh recombination and parasitic optical losses .    with the emitter as thin as @xmath6",
    ", the cell efficiency is likely to be limited by the diffusion length @xmath38 of the minority carriers ( electrons ) in the base . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5](a ) we show the efficiency as a function of the absorber thickness and @xmath38 , calculated for the structure with lambertian light trapping .",
    "the diffusion length of holes in the highly - doped emitter is taken equal to @xmath39 .",
    "it can be seen that thicker cells are more sensitive to srh recombination . in this",
    "regard , thinner cells with the absorber thickness of around @xmath2 can reach nearly the same @xmath20 as the thicker cells , but the conditions in terms of absorber quality are relaxed . finally , reducing the absorber quality ( i.e. , decreasing @xmath38 ) shifts the optimal thickness towards thinner cells .",
    "results shown in fig .  [ fig : fig5](b ) are calculated including parasitic losses @xmath40 .",
    "we estimate that this is approximately the level of parasitic losses in the hit cells discussed above .",
    "the trends are similar to those calculated assuming @xmath36 , yet the maximum achievable efficiency is proportionally decreased .",
    "moreover , for a given efficiency level , the optimal thickness is increased .    the results of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] allow us to estimate the optimum thickness and the required material quality to reach a given efficiency level .",
    "for example , to surpass 26% efficiency , in the idealized case of no parasitic losses and complete ( lambertian ) light trapping , we need an electron diffusion length around @xmath41 . in the more realistic case , when parasitic losses are included",

    "[ fig : fig6 ] we show the efficiency as a function of ( a ) front and ( b ) back surface recombination velocity ( srv ) , and of the absorber thickness . at first , for the bulk transport losses we assume only auger recombination .",
    "it can be seen that approaching the efficiency limits requires srv to be less than a few cm / s , with solar cells being more sensitive to recombination at the rear interface rather than to recombination at the front .    in the calculations",
    "above , we assumed a perfect material quality . yet , in our previous work we have demonstrated that the importance of surface recombination depends on bulk recombination rate , i.e. , the higher is the material quality , the more important are losses at the surface @xcite . from now on we focus on front surface recombination , neglecting recombination at the back , which has anyway to be of the order of a few cm / s to target high efficiency .",
    "in realistic devices , there is usually an oxide passivating layer at the back and point contacts are implemented . for this reason",
    ", back srv can be significantly reduced . on the other hand",

    "in general , the cells are fairly insensitive to recombination at the front interface if srv is below a few hundreds of cm / s .",
    "this is of the order of magnitude of the effective srv , currently measured for nanostructured solar cells @xcite .",

    "in conclusion , we presented an electro - optical framework to calculate the limiting efficiency of c - si solar cells . in our approach",
    ", we take the analytical photogeneration rate ( assuming full or partial light trapping ) and numerically solve the drift - diffusion equations to obtain the cell performance .",
    "this gives a realistic description of carrier dynamics in the device and allows easily introducing intrinsic and extrinsic loss mechanisms .",

    "we have demonstrated that the limiting efficiency as a function of the absorber thickness exhibits a wide maximum : @xmath2 thick cell can be nearly as efficient as the solar cell with the optimal absorber thickness ( around @xmath16 ) .",
    "it is therefore more practical to consider the _ optimal thickness range _ , rather than a single optimal thickness .",
    "in this regard , we argued that decreasing the thickness below around @xmath2 is counter - productive , as it significantly reduces the maximum achievable efficiency .",
    "when extrinsic srh recombination is considered , we notice that thicker cells are more sensitive to bulk losses , and therefore the conditions to reach the limiting efficiency for thinner cells are relaxed . yet , including surface recombination shows the opposite trend : thicker cells are less sensitive to surface recombination , as the surface - to - volume ratio is reduced .",
    "nevertheless , for a reasonably high bulk and surface quality , it remains true that decreasing the thickness below a few tens of micrometers is counter - productive in terms of the efficiency .",
    "the current efficiency record for single junction silicon solar cells is 25.6% @xcite .",

    "<S> we identify incomplete light trapping and parasitic losses as a major roadblock in improving the efficiency upon the current record of 25.6% for silicon solar cells . finally , considering the main parameters that impact solar cell performance , we quantify the constraints and requirements for achieving a specified energy conversion efficiency , which is important for a proper design strategy of high efficiency silicon solar cells . </S>"
