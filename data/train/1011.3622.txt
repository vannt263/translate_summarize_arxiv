    "@xcite and start with the cavity field equation : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the time - varying pump field , @xmath46 is the cavity frequency , @xmath1 is the cavity field decay rate , @xmath47 is the external coupling rate , @xmath48 is the optomechanical coupling , @xmath49 is the cavity field , and @xmath50 is the mechanical mode amplitude . in this case , we are inputing a laser at @xmath6 which is detuned from the optical cavity mode center frequency , and the input is modulated periodically with frequency @xmath51 , which is detuned from the mechanical mode center frequency @xmath52 .",
    "we assume sinusoidal mechanical motion , such that the beam also moves with modulation frequency @xmath51 : @xmath53 note that @xmath51 could be different from @xmath52 , but since we re driving the motion , we can assume the mechanical mode responds with the same frequency .",
    "then the equation becomes : @xmath54      since our pump is modulated with frequency @xmath51 , we express @xmath58 as a fourier series , and find the full inhomogeneous solution : @xmath59 with @xmath60 , and neglecting the @xmath61 term as normalization :    because the homogeneous solution levels out with rate @xmath1 and this is fast , the particular solution is the steady state solution .",

    "note that our thermal amplitude is @xmath88 , and @xmath89 10 pm in this case , which places us in the high @xmath90 regime ( despite the sidebands being unresolved , we have @xmath91 ) .",

    "<S> optomechanics , the study of the interaction between light and mechanical motion , has recently captured the imagination of photonics researchers @xcite . for example , researchers have probed radio frequency ( rf ) mechanical motion of nanometer sized objects @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , proposals for using the optical gradient force to induce mechanical motion @xcite with @xcite and without @xcite the use of an optical cavity have been experimentally demonstrated . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , at very high optical and mechanical confinement @xcite , the amplitude of a mechanical mode can be greatly increased . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , at high input powers , regenerative mechanical oscillations occur , where the linewidth of the mechanical mode greatly decreases , while the amplitude of the mechanical oscillation greatly increases .    </S>",
    "<S> the experiments above have been done with continuous - wave ( cw ) excitation of an optical cavity or modulated excitation of a waveguide . </S>",
    "<S> however , the cw excitation mechanism requires the mechanical motion to induce an out - of - phase modulation of the laser input , as only those forces in quadrature with the mechanical motion perform mechanical work on the structure . </S>",
    "<S> such effects are generally small , as the thermal motion of the structure only weakly perturbs the optical transmission properties of a waveguide or cavity . in the cw case , </S>",
    "<S> the amount of work done on the mechanical cavity is proportional to @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the optical field decay rate in the cavity . </S>",
    "<S> however , an alternative to increase the transduction between optical power and mechanical motion is to use modulated pumping @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such a scheme can do work that is proportional to @xmath2 , and greatly reduce the amount of power needed to excite the mechanical mode ( see appendix ) . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the use of optical pump modulation in conjunction with an optical cavity to reduce the amount of power needed to actuate the mechanical mode . because of the optical confinement and recirculation of photons , </S>",

    "<S> in particular , we choose to work with the double beam one - dimensional photonic crystal ( pc ) cavity configuration in silicon . </S>",
    "<S> due to its high optical quality factor ( @xmath3 ) , which enhances the circulating optical power inside the cavity , and low mode volume ( @xmath4 ) , which also enhances the local field potential , the pc cavity can greatly enhance the optical gradient force . </S>",
    "<S> the optomechanical coupling rate is defined as : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the optical cavity frequency and @xmath7 is the mechanical displacement of the cavity . by using cavities where the @xmath8-field is increased near material boundaries ( such as in a slotted design @xcite ) </S>",

    "<S> the larger holes at the center of the cavity create an optical potential well that lies in the optical bandgap of the array of outer holes , and such a design allows robust and high - efficiency coupling to the cavity region via a coupling waveguide . </S>",

    "<S> we observe an enhanced electric field in the air slot region for the bonded modes because of the continuity conditions for the dominant @xmath19 field at the slot boundaries ( i.e. continuity of the displacement vector @xmath22 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we expect that the bonded optical modes have the highest optomechanical coupling to the in - plane mechanical modes , as the high electric field concentration in the middle of the cavity enhances the change in the optical cavity frequency with mechanical deformations . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , we work with the first and second order bonded optical modes in our experiments .    we experimentally analyze the optical properties of the cavity using the setup in fig . </S>",

    "<S> in particular , we find the first order common and differential modes for in - plane motion @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> we observe the two mechanical modes in the rf spectrum , shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : rfmodes](a ) , which correspond well to the simulated in - plane mechanical mode frequencies , and slight discrepancies can be attributed to minor differences in the clamping conditions of the fabricated device . </S>",
    "<S> because of the low optical @xmath21 of the te@xmath15 mode and the low optical power buildup , we do not observe the giant optical spring effect seen in previous works @xcite , as the mechanical modes do not change frequency with increasing pump power . </S>",
    "<S> we also do not observe significant changes in the optical cavity wavelength with pump power , suggesting minimal heating . </S>",

    "<S> we scan through the first - order optical mode with various unmodulated powers , and observe that the first order cavity resonance is not significantly changed , suggesting that the injected power on the first order optical mode does not change the temperature of the beam , and thus does not modulate the beam transmission via the thermo - optic effect . although both lasers pass through the cavity and are extracted with the same output grating coupler , the laser on te@xmath14 is blocked by a band - pass filter centered at 1550 nm with a full - width at half - max of 12 nm . </S>",

    "<S> the two curves correspond to the response at ambient atmosphere and in vacuum , both with the same probe intensity on the te@xmath15 mode ( 2 @xmath9w).,width=336 ]    we also measure the rf response of the probe laser on te@xmath15 as we change the power of the modulated pump laser on te@xmath14 . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : rfmodes](d ) , we observe the rf response is decreased as the modulation frequency is detuned from the mechanical resonance . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the relationship between the integrated power in the rf response and the input laser power on te@xmath14 is quadratic for all detunings . </S>",
    "<S> this is expected , as the rf spectrum analyzer measures the power of the voltage signal from the transimpedance amplifier of our detector , and that power has a quadratic relationship with the amplifier output voltage and thus a quadratic relationship with the output rf oscillation amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates a linear relationship between displacement and input pump power on the first order mode .    </S>",
    "<S> we also measure the rf power spectrum from te@xmath15 when we fix the average laser power on te@xmath14 , and increase the power of the pump on the second order mode , as shown in fig [ fig : rfseries](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> again , we observe that the integrated rf response of the driven mechanical mode is quadratic with the input power , which is expected as the sideband amplitude is linearly related to the probe power . we also obtain the rf response as a function of the input power on te@xmath14 for various probe powers on te@xmath15 , shown in fig [ fig : rfseries](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the rf response is reduced for lower input powers , as the sideband powers are proportional to the input probe power . </S>",
    "<S> however , we are able to observe an rf response with only 100 nw coupled to the te@xmath14 mode to drive the mechanical oscillations , and only 200 nw coupled to the te@xmath15 mode to sense the mechanical motion .    finally , we compare the efficiency of exciting the mechanical mode in vacuum and in ambient atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> we fix the input power for the probe laser on the te@xmath15 mode in both air and vacuum to 2 @xmath9w , and obtain the same output coupled power into our photodetector . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the power series from the same cavity under both conditions , which is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : rfseries](d ) . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , the amplitude of the mechanical oscillation is significantly higher in vacuum than in ambient atmosphere , due to the higher mechanical @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the experimentally measured factor of 20 between the power needed to generate the same rf response in air and vacuum matches well with the ratio of mechanical @xmath21s for the two conditions ( 31 ) .    in conclusion , we have demonstrated resonant actuation of a mechanical mode with optical gradient forces . </S>",
    "<S> the input power needed to observe driven motion of the mechanical cavity is greatly decreased in the presence of an optical cavity , and hundreds of nanowatts can drive the mechanical motion via a modulated laser coupled to a second cavity mode . </S>",
    "<S> this type of excitation can be used to probe various mechanical modes , as the rf response can be increased relative to the thermal - driven oscillations . </S>",
