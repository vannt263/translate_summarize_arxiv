    "the possibility to have unification of fundamental interactions is one of the main motivations for the physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . partial realization of this dream is an intrinsic feature of the so - called grand unified theories which are hence considered the most natural extensions of the standard model .",
    "the simplest grand unified theory ( gut ) is the @xmath0 model of georgi and glashow  @xcite .",
    "one generation of the sm matter is partially unified and the higgs sector is truly minimal .",
    "this theory is very predictive but it is certainly not realistic : one can not unify experimentally observed gauge couplings at the high scale , neutrinos are massless , and unification of yukawa couplings of the down quarks and charged leptons at the high scale contradicts experimentally inferred values .",
    "recently , there have been several efforts to define simple realistic extensions of the georgi - glashow ( gg ) model . in particular , it has been shown  @xcite that the simplest extension with the sm matter content and an extra @xmath5 dimensional representation in the higgs sector simultaneously generates neutrino masses via type ii seesaw mechanism  @xcite and achieves unification .",
    "different phenomenological and cosmological aspects of this proposal have been analyzed and reviewed in subsequent works  @xcite . in short ,",
    "this theory predicts existence of light scalar leptoquarks and an upper bound on the proton lifetime : @xmath6years .",
    "therefore , this realistic grand unified theory could be tested in future collider experiments , particularly at lhc , through the production of scalar leptoquarks and in the next generation of proton decay experiments .",
    "if , on the other hand , one contemplates extensions of the gg model with extra fermions , there is another simple realistic gut model with an extra adjoint representation of fermions",
    ". this possibility has been recently introduced  @xcite .",
    "the model is very appealing since it generates two massive neutrinos via combination of both type iii  @xcite and type i  @xcite seesaw due to the presence of higher - dimensional operators .",
    "that model is the primary focus of our work and we refer to it as `` @xmath0 with @xmath7 '' in what follows for clarity .    in this paper",
    "we study the constraints on the spectrum of the @xmath0 model proposed in  @xcite coming from gauge unification and perturbativity at the one - loop level .",
    "furthermore , we discuss in detail correlation between the ultraviolet cutoff of the @xmath0 with @xmath7 , prediction for the fermion masses and proton decay .",
    "we find that the upper bound on the mass of the fermionic @xmath1 triplet responsible for type iii seesaw mechanism depends strongly on the cutoff .",
    "the most exciting scenario is when the cutoff of the theory is identified with the planck scale as in the original proposal  @xcite . in that case",
    "the discovery of those``@xmath1 gauginos '' is imminent .",
    "if that is not the case , part of the predictivity is lost in terms of both collider and proton decay signatures .",
    "in fact , if one lowers the cutoff and does ( not ) neglect a freedom in the quark and lepton mixing angles , the upper bound on the fermionic triplet mass is at @xmath3gev ( @xmath4gev ) . towards the end",
    "we also discuss possible origins of the higher - dimensional operators that make the original model  @xcite realistic and propose some alternative scenarios .",
    "the @xmath0 model of georgi and glashow  @xcite is the simplest gut .",
    "it offers partial matter unification of one sm family @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) in the anti - fundamental @xmath10 and antisymmetric @xmath11 representations .",
    "the higgs sector comprises the adjoint @xmath12 and fundamental @xmath13 representations .",
    "the gut symmetry is broken down to the sm by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the sm singlet in the @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) , while the sm higgs resides in the @xmath16 .",
    "the beauty of the model can not be denied . however , the model itself is not realistic .",
    "we are interested in the predictions of a promising extension of the gg model with an extra fermionic adjoint @xmath17 that has been introduced only recently  @xcite .",
    "the nice feature of this extension is that neutrino masses are generated using both type iii and type i seesaw mechanisms .",
    "although it has been argued that @xmath18 could be very light  @xcite the interplay between perturbativity , unification constraint , fermionic mass spectrum and proton decay has not been studied to corroborate that claim . in this section",
    "we study this issue in order to find correct upper bound on the mass of @xmath18the field responsible for type iii seesaw mechanism .",
    "the possibility to test this theory through proton decay is also discussed .",
    "we also suggest possible origins of the higher - dimensional operators that play critical role in the original model  @xcite and suggest alternative scenarios that implement the hybrid seesaw framework of the original proposal .      in order to understand the constraints coming from the unification of gauge couplings we use the well - known relations  @xcite : @xmath19 where the coefficients @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the so - called effective coefficients . here",
    "@xmath22 are the appropriate one - loop @xmath23 coefficients of the particle @xmath24 with mass @xmath25 , where @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) is its `` running weight '' .",
    "@xmath28 is the gut scale where the sm gauge couplings meet .",
    "we find :    [ conditions ] @xmath29    where we use @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32  @xcite .",
    ".   is sometimes referred to as the @xmath33-test .",
    "it basically shows whether unification takes place or not .",
    ", on the other hand , can be referred to as the gut scale relation since it yields the gut scale value when eq .",
    "is satisfied .",
    "the gut scale relation can also bound @xmath28 for the given particle content of the theory without any reference to eq .  .",
    "the @xmath33-test fails badly in the sm case : @xmath34 .",
    "hence the need for extra light particles with suitable @xmath35 coefficients .",
    "the @xmath35 coefficients for all the particles in the gg scenario are presented in table  [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "clearly , only @xmath36 can slightly improve unification with respect to the sm case , i.e. , @xmath37 at most . in table",
    "[ tab : table2 ] we shown extra contributions to the @xmath35 coefficients in the adjoint @xmath0  @xcite . notice that the field @xmath18 is the only field that can further improve unification .",
    "it is thus clear that it has to be below the gut scale and that the upper bound on @xmath38 corresponds to the smallest allowed value for @xmath39 .",
    ".[tab : table1 ] @xmath35 coefficients in the gg model  @xcite . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     before we address the implications of the exact gauge coupling unification within the scenario with the @xmath40 dimensional fermionic representation we need to investigate the question of fermion masses .",
    "clearly , the model must rely on higher - dimensional operators to be realistic which critically affects fermion masses in three different sectors .",
    "firstly , these operators correct the gut scale relation @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are yukawa matrices for the down quarks and charged leptons , respectively .",
    "secondly , they increase the rank of the effective neutrino mass matrix from one to two . as a result two neutrinos",
    "are predicted to be massive  @xcite .",
    "thirdly , they generate mass splitting between the fermionic fields in @xmath44 that is crucial in order to achieve unification .",
    "hence , the low - energy predictions of the theory depend critically on the cut - off scale that determines their maximal impact . clearly , the higher that scale is the more predictive the theory becomes .",
    "if the cut - off goes to infinity one recovers renormalizable model which is not consistent with experimental data .",
    "thus , the cut - off scale can not be arbitrarily large . in the original proposal",
    "@xcite the cut - off ( @xmath45 ) is at the planck scale @xmath46gev .",
    "this yields , as the most significant result , rather low limit on the mass of @xmath18 which should be at the electroweak scale .",
    "we find that this cut - off , at least at the one - loop level , leaves very narrow allowed region within which both @xmath1 triplets  fermionic and bosonic  are at the electroweak scale and the proton decay lifetime is an order of magnitude below the current experimental bounds if we neglect the quark and lepton mixings .",
    "however , we also find that if one lowers @xmath45 , the upper bound on the mass of @xmath18 relaxes significantly .",
    "to reach these conclusions we rely on the upper bound on the cutoff that comes from the relation between charged fermion masses . in this particular case",
    "the least conservative bound reads @xmath47 eq .",
    "is obtained by considering the difference between @xmath42 and @xmath43 at the gut scale and assuming that the yukawa coefficients @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) that multiply higher - dimensional operators remain perturbativity , i.e. , @xmath50 .",
    "see reference  @xcite for details .",
    "we also use the well - known @xmath0 relation for the masses of proton decay mediating gauge bosons : @xmath51 .",
    "the mass splitting between @xmath52 and @xmath53 is negligible for our purposes and we identified them with the gut scale , i.e. , @xmath54 .",
    "since @xmath55 and @xmath56 do not unify to a high degree as can happen in supersymmetric @xmath0 theory the upper limit on @xmath45 is determined by the mismatch between @xmath55 and @xmath56 masses at the gut scale .",
    "see for example fig .  1 in  @xcite for behavior of @xmath57 and @xmath58 as one goes from low energy to high energy scales .",
    "note that the most conservative limit on @xmath45 is in fact proportional to @xmath59 . in any case , one can find @xmath60 , @xmath57 , @xmath61 and @xmath28 at any point allowed by unification and check whether inferred @xmath45 from eq .",
    "is consistent with the initial assumption @xmath62 .    in order to find the maximal allowed value for @xmath45 we need to maximize @xmath28",
    "that turns out to be easy .",
    "namely , there exist a simple procedure to find maximal value for the gut scale as a function of @xmath63 as allowed by the assumption that planck scale effects split multiplets of @xmath44 .",
    "we will explain all the details later .",
    "what is important at this point is the following .",
    "if we set @xmath64 and @xmath65 we get @xmath66gev for @xmath67 , @xmath68gev and @xmath69gev at the one - loop level . at the same time we find @xmath70 where the errors are associated to the @xmath71 variation of the @xmath55 quark mass at the @xmath72 scale .",
    "we take as input @xmath73gev and @xmath74gev at @xmath72  @xcite .",
    "this in turn implies via eq .   that @xmath45 barely reaches the planck scale ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "since @xmath76 remains almost constant in the region of interest and @xmath28 can only be below its maximal value that means that if the cutoff of the theory is the planck scale the allowed parameter space is extremely narrow . to illustrate our point we plot the allowed parameter space for @xmath39 and @xmath77 in @xmath28@xmath38 plane in fig .",
    "[ figure : two ] .",
    "( note , whenever we refer to @xmath78 we also refer to @xmath79 since @xmath80 . )",
    "the region to the left of the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ figure : two ] is excluded through the use of eq .  .",
    "more precisely , the dashed line is obtained by setting @xmath62 and then plotting the smallest possible value of @xmath28 as allowed by eq .  .",
    "the region to the right of the blue line is eliminated by the perturbativity constraints on the spectrum of fermionic particles in the adjoint representation as we discuss later .",
    "the only viable parameter space is the strip between the blue and dashed line .",
    "this scenario could clearly be tested at the lhc since both the bosonic and fermionic triplets are light . moreover , proton decay is only factor 36 away from the current bound on the proton lifetime . to move the strip to the right one",
    "needs to either lower slightly mass of @xmath81 or @xmath82 .",
    "this however would make the allowed region disappear once @xmath83gev is reached .",
    "since the prediction for @xmath38 is practically at the present experimental limit on its mass @xmath84gev  @xcite , which admittedly is model dependent , the two - loop analysis would probably be in order .",
    "we do not attempt that since even the full one - loop treatment would also have to include influence of higher - dimensional operators on the gauge coupling unification conditions  @xcite which we neglected .     gauge coupling unification at the one - loop level for central values of low - energy observables .",
    "blue line corresponds to the bound coming from perturbativity constraints on the mass spectrum of the particles in the fermionic adjoint , i.e.  @xmath85 .",
    "red line corresponds to the up - to - date experimental bound from proton decay on @xmath28 .",
    "dashed line corresponds to the minimal value of @xmath28 if the cutoff is taken to be the planck scale . in the triangle given by the blue line , @xmath86gev line and @xmath87gev we get @xmath88.,width=384 ]    unfortunately",
    ", we do not know what the cutoff(s ) is ( are ) and we also have to see how the predictions of @xmath0 with @xmath7 hold if we allow @xmath45 to vary within reasonable range @xmath89 .",
    "before we answer what happens if we lower @xmath45 let us discuss the correct procedure to obtain exact gauge coupling unification within this scenario in view of the fact that the masses of particles within the fermionic adjoint are related to each other .",
    "the masses of relevant particles in @xmath44 to the leading order in @xmath90 are  @xcite : @xmath91,\\\\ m_{\\rho_3 } & = & m_f -\\frac{3 \\lambda_f v}{\\sqrt{30}}+ \\frac{v^2}{\\lambda } \\left[a_1+\\frac{3}{10}(a_3+a_4)\\right],\\\\ m_{\\rho_8 } & = & m_f + \\frac{2 \\lambda_f v}{\\sqrt{30}}+ \\frac{v^2}{\\lambda } \\left[a_1+\\frac{2}{15}(a_3+a_4)\\right],\\\\ m_{\\rho_{(3,2 ) } } & = & m_f -\\frac{\\lambda_f v}{2 \\sqrt{30}}+ \\frac{v^2}{\\lambda } \\left[a_1+\\frac{(13 a_3- 12 a_4)}{60}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is understood that @xmath92 and @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) should be perturbative .",
    "we hence demand that @xmath95 . in that case",
    "we obtain @xmath96 where we again use @xmath97 .",
    "clearly , @xmath63 , @xmath77 and @xmath38 are not independent from each other .",
    "in fact , perturbativity of @xmath98 implies that there are three regimes :    * in the first regime , @xmath63 and @xmath77 could both be at the gut scale as long as @xmath99 . in that case",
    "@xmath38 must be of the order of @xmath100 or smaller where it wants to be anyway in order to fix the b - test .",
    "in this regime the gut scale is too low to be in agreement with the experimental limits on proton decay lifetime unless one allows for special realization of fermion mass matrices  @xcite . even though we do not advocate this scenario it is important to realize that this is still allowed by experimental data and the structure of the model . in that case",
    "one needs @xmath45 to be around @xmath101gev in order to suppress proton decay by adjusting yukawa couplings of ordinary matter  @xcite .",
    "we show one such example in fig .",
    "[ figure : one ] . * in the second regime , @xmath38 is small and @xmath63 and @xmath77 are both of the order of @xmath100 .",
    "the cancellation between the two masses does not have to be as efficient as in the first case and one can easily see that the upper bound on @xmath28 comes when @xmath102 , i.e. , @xmath103 .",
    "recall , light @xmath78 spoils unification .",
    "hence , in the large @xmath28 regime @xmath78 has to be as heavy as possible .",
    "this scenario is promising since large gut scale implies light @xmath18 .",
    "it is this scenario that is advocated in  @xcite .",
    "example given in fig .",
    "[ figure : two ] corresponds to this scenario once we fix @xmath62 .",
    "* there is however a third scenario that interpolates between the two .",
    "the nice feature of this scenario is that it yields correct upper bound on the mass of @xmath18",
    ". it can be best grasped by considering the case when both @xmath63 and @xmath38 are below the gut scale . in this case",
    "the gut scale is guaranteed to be large .",
    "it is then easy to see that if @xmath104 and @xmath105 one obtains @xmath106 we will next discuss this case to establish an upper bound on @xmath107 .",
    "clearly , since in this theory @xmath108 and proton decay experiments require @xmath109@xmath110gev then eq .   implies that we need a scenario where @xmath111@xmath112gev .",
    "this then allows us to maximize @xmath38 in order to understand the testability of the model .",
    "so , to maximize @xmath38 at the one - loop level is simple .",
    "all one needs is to set @xmath113 , @xmath114 and solve for @xmath63 , @xmath38 and @xmath28 using b - test , the gut scale relation and eq .   where @xmath28 must match the most stringent constraint coming from proton decay .",
    "we find that @xmath115gev , @xmath116gev , @xmath117gev , @xmath118 and accordingly @xmath119gev .",
    "so , the correct upper bound on @xmath38 at the one - loop level is @xmath120gev .",
    "one can also check that @xmath121 which implies that higher order corrections in @xmath90 on eq .   can not significantly affect our conclusions .",
    "as far as experimental proton decay constraints are concerned we match @xmath28 with the experimental limit from the dominant proton decay mode in @xmath0 which is usually taken to be @xmath122 .",
    "the theoretical prediction for this channel can be summarized in the following way : @xmath123years . here",
    ", @xmath124 is a relevant matrix element .",
    "so , the current experimental limit @xmath125years  @xcite translates into the following bound on @xmath28 : @xmath126gev .",
    "red line in fig .",
    "[ figure : two ] is generated using this result .",
    "let us finally address the case when we allow for suppression of the proton decay through gauge boson mediation  @xcite in the adjoint @xmath0 model .",
    "that case would correspond to the first scenario when @xmath127 .",
    "so , allowed region would be very narrow strip given by the allowed range for @xmath98 .",
    "we show one such scenario in fig .",
    "[ figure : one ] , where the vertical blue lines correspond to the bounds coming from perturbativity , i.e. @xmath128 . from this plot",
    "we can basically find the upper bound on the mass of the fermionic @xmath1 triplet @xmath18 responsible for the type iii seesaw mechanism to be @xmath129gev .",
    "this bound clearly reflects the worst case scenario as far as the testability of the model is concerned . the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ figure : one ] is the experimental bound on @xmath28 if @xmath130 gauge mediated proton decay is suppressed .",
    "it corresponds to @xmath131gev  @xcite .     the gauge coupling unification at the one - loop level for central values of low - energy observables .",
    "blue lines correspond to the bounds coming from perturbativity , i.e. @xmath132 . the dashed line in is the experimental bound on @xmath28 if @xmath130 gauge mediated proton decay is suppressed.,width=384 ]    we stress again that the maximal value of the gut scale depends crucially on the cutoff of the theory .",
    "in fact , the highest value that the gut scale can reach at the one - loop level in this model is basically @xmath133gev which corresponds to setting @xmath134 in eq .  .",
    "with that in mind we make the following two comments regarding proton decay . if we neglect the fermionic mixings we can make a naive estimation of the upper bound on the proton decay lifetime to be @xmath135 years . of course",
    ", the absolute upper bound , if we use the whole freedom in the yukawa sector , reads as @xmath136 , where we set @xmath137 and @xmath138 gev@xmath139 for the matrix element .",
    "before we conclude , let us address the issue of the possible origin of higher - dimensional operators .",
    "after all , they play decisive role in making the model @xmath0 with @xmath7 realistic .",
    "the original model  @xcite includes higher - dimensional operators that are suppressed by the planck scale .",
    "we have confirmed that these operators are indeed sufficient , albeit barely , to make the model viable .",
    "operators of this sort are expected to appear on general grounds as harbingers of gravitational physics where the only relevant scale is the planck scale . as such",
    ", they have been extensively used in the grand unified model building ever since they were proposed to correct the georgi - glashow fermion mass predictions  @xcite .",
    "if , however , the cutoff scale is below the planck scale one might ask for the possible renormalizable model that would effectively mimic the original model . to this end",
    "we observe that one does not need to invoke nonrenormalizable operators at all nor any `` exotic '' physical setup .",
    "namely , in order to have the most minimal renormalizable setup that yields the original model , it is sufficient to introduce the following additional matter representations : @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "these can clearly have masses above the gut scale that can be identified with the scale @xmath45 .",
    "once these fields are integrated out the effective model would have exactly the same features as the original model  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the established upper limits on the masses of @xmath18 and @xmath36 would still hold as well as the upper bound on @xmath28 .",
    "there is another rather different renormalizable realization of the model in question .",
    "namely , if one introduces an additional @xmath144-dimensional higgs field one can simultaneously generate both the charged  @xcite and neutrino masses at the renormalizable level  @xcite .",
    "however , in this case the predictions are quite different .",
    "this is primarily due to the fact that there are more fields that can potentially contribute to the running of the gauge couplings and proton decay .",
    "moreover , the possible mass spectrum of the fields in @xmath7 is rather different  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 scenario that incorporates combination of type i and type iii seesaw due to the presence of extra fermionic adjoint is tailor - made for applications within the extra - dimensional setup . here ,",
    "in particular , we have in mind a five - dimensional nonsupersymmetric framework  @xcite . in this approach the @xmath0 symmetry of the five - dimensional bulk",
    "is reduced to the effective sm symmetry on one four - dimensional brane and @xmath0 symmetry on the other brane by compactification upon @xmath145 .",
    "such a setup would naturally accommodate doublet - triplet splitting if the sm higgs field originates from the bulk .",
    "also , since the symmetry breaking would be accomplish using the judicious parity assignment under @xmath146 and @xmath147 there would not be any need for the adjoint higgs representation .",
    "in other words , there is a possibility to have a rather predictive setup due to potentially very small number of light extra fields with respect to the sm particle content .",
    "in addition , it would be possible to completely suppress proton decay for particular locations of matter fields .",
    "one particular nice feature of this framework is that the parity assignment that yields the sm on one of the branes generates same parity properties for @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 in the fermionic adjoint .",
    "this would guarantee , unlike in the ordinary four - dimensional framework , that the least massive fermionic triplet and singlet states are degenerate as long as they originate from the bulk .",
    "in addition , this assignment automatically insures that no anomalies are introduced at the branes .",
    "one possible scenario would be to have the @xmath141 and @xmath144 dimensional higgs representations in the bulk along with the gauge fields . in that case",
    "it would be possible to build the model with all the matter fields located on the @xmath0 brane .",
    "we investigated the relation between perturbativity , unification constraint , prediction for fermion masses , proton decay and ultra - violet cutoff @xmath45 within the @xmath0 grand unified theory with minimal scalar content and an extra adjoint representation of fermions .",
    "if the cutoff is at the planck scale the upper bound on the mass of the type iii triplets is practically at the current experimental limit @xmath151gev . in that case both the idea of grand unification and nature of seesaw mechanism could be tested at collider experiments through the production of those particles .",
    "moreover , the prediction for the proton decay lifetime is at most an order of magnitude away from the present experimental limits .",
    "if the cutoff is below the planck scale we find that the upper bound on the mass of the fermionic @xmath1 triplet responsible for type iii seesaw mechanism is @xmath152gev if we use the strongest constraints on the gut scale coming from proton decay , @xmath153@xmath154gev .",
    "finally , if we allow for suppression of proton decay operators using the full freedom of the model the limit is not relevant for collider physics at all and it reads @xmath155gev . since the predictions of the model depend critically on the cutoff we have addressed the issue of the possible origin of the higher - dimensional operators and proposed some alternative scenarios .",
    "let us finally compare our results with the results presented in refs .",
    "firstly , we show that @xmath156 can be the uv cutoff of @xmath0 with @xmath7 .",
    "this is in conflict with the results presented in ref .",
    "@xcite where the authors retract their initial claim  @xcite .",
    "secondly , the upper bound on the mass of @xmath78@xmath157as suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite depends on the specific assumptions about the cutoff and hence does not reflect the full parameter freedom of the model .",
    "see in particular eq .",
    "( 11 ) in  @xcite and eq .",
    "( 12 ) in  @xcite . in fact , we show that @xmath78 could be at the gut scale . as a consequence ,",
    "we obtain the upper bound on the mass of @xmath18 that is two orders of magnitude above the bounds suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite if we neglect the quark and lepton mixing angles .",
    "thirdly , we show that the absolute upper bound on the mass of @xmath18 , the field responsible for type iii seesaw , is @xmath4gev if we use the full freedom of the model .",

    "<S> we investigate correlation between gauge coupling unification , fermion mass spectrum , proton decay , perturbativity and ultraviolet cutoff within an @xmath0 grand unified theory with minimal scalar content and an extra adjoint representation of fermions . </S>",
    "<S> we find strong correlation between the upper bound on the mass of both the bosonic and fermionic @xmath1 triplets and the cutoff . </S>",
    "<S> the upper bound on the mass of fermionic triplet responsible for type iii seesaw mechanism is @xmath2gev for the planck scale cutoff . in that case both the idea of grand unification and nature of seesaw mechanism could be tested at future collider experiments through the production of those particles . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the prediction for the proton decay lifetime is at most an order of magnitude away from the present experimental limits . </S>",
    "<S> if the cutoff is lowered these predictions change significantly . in the most general scenario , </S>",
    "<S> if one does ( not ) neglect a freedom in the quark and lepton mixing angles , the upper bound on the fermionic triplet mass is at @xmath3gev ( @xmath4gev ) . </S>",
    "<S> since the predictions of the model critically depend on the presence of the higher - dimensional operators and corresponding cutoff we address the issue of their possible origin and also propose alternative scenarios that implement the hybrid seesaw framework of the original proposal . </S>"
