    "the casimir effect is an important quantum effect proposed about 70 years ago @xcite .",
    "the idea of the casimir effect is very natural .",
    "the ground state energy of a quantum harmonic oscillator is not zero but is equal to @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the frequency of oscillator .",
    "a quantum field can be regarded as a superposition of infinitely many quantum harmonic oscillators .",
    "hence it is natural to sum up the ground state energies of all the constituent oscillators , and the sum is known as the casimir energy . in the presence of boundaries or external conditions ,",
    "the casimir energy would create a nontrivial stress on the boundaries .",
    "although the idea is simple , the actual computation of the casimir energy is highly nontrivial because the sum is divergent .",
    "various mathematical tools have been introduced to compute the casimir energies of various systems , including zeta function method , exponential cut - off method , green s function approach , etc .",
    "various machineries have also been introduced to remove the divergencies .",
    "one setup that is known to produce renormalization independent result is the piston setup @xcite .",
    "in essence , the piston geometry gives rise to interaction between two parallel plates confined inside a long cylinder .",
    "in fact , after removing self - energies , the casimir energy for the interaction between two compact objects is always finite .    nevertheless , the computation of the casimir interaction energy between two objects , where one or both of them is not planar , posted another major challenge to the field for a long time .",
    "although casimir experiments are performed for the sphere - plate interaction , it was much later when researchers successfully develop the necessary machineries to compute the casimir interaction energy of the sphere - plate configuration . before this , one relies on the proximity force approximation to obtain an approximation to the casimir interaction force , under the assumption that when the separation between the objects is very small , a good approximation is obtained by dividing the pair of interacting surfaces into infinitely many pair of parallel plates , and sum over the force of the latter .",
    "however , without the exact formula for the casimir interaction energy , one can not justify the validity range of the proximity force approximation .    a breakthrough to the problem appeared in 2006 , where several groups of researchers employed different guises of multiple scattering method or the mode summation approach to obtain explicit functional formulas for the casimir interaction energies of the sphere - plate , sphere - sphere , cylinder - plate and cylinder - cylinder configurations @xcite .",
    "these have made possible a more precise numerical or analytical study of the properties and strength of the casimir interactions .",
    "one of the most interesting questions that is resolved is the validity of the proximity force approximation , and the correction to the proximity force approximation .    in the pioneering work @xcite ,",
    "bordag has developed a method to compute the small separation asymptotic expansion of the casimir interaction energy between a cylinder and a plate up to the next - to - leading order term .",
    "this was later generalized to the sphere - plate , cylinder - cylinder and sphere - sphere configurations @xcite .",
    "although the casimir interaction due to massless scalar field is quite well - understood , so far no one has considered the casimir interaction of massive scalar field between nontrivial objects .",
    "however , massive scalar field plays an important role in quantum field theory .",
    "the casimir effect of massive scalar field has been studied in @xcite for the interaction between two plates or within a single spherical shell .",
    "the main objective of this work is to extend the studies of casimir interaction between a sphere and a plate from massless scalar field to massive scalar field .",
    "we will concentrate on computing the correction to the proximity force approximation . for the sphere - plate interaction due to massless scalar field",
    ", it has been shown in @xcite that , up to the next - to - leading order term , @xmath2 where x , y @xmath3 d or n are the boundary conditions on the sphere and the plate , @xmath4 is the leading term that coincides with the proximity force approximation , @xmath5and @xmath6 is a number that governs the correction to proximity force approximation , whose values are found to be @xmath7 the main goal of this work is to find the corrections to these formulas when the mass of the scalar field is nonzero .",
    "quite surprisingly , the formulas turn up to be quite complicated .",
    "the equation of motion of a massive scalar field is @xmath8 with @xmath9we find that @xmath10 satisfies the equation @xmath11 where @xmath12 using the same method as in the massless case @xcite , we can derive the formula for the casimir interaction energy . since the details have been discussed in @xcite",
    ", we will not repeat them here .",
    "in fact , compare to the massless case , we find that @xmath13 is given by instead of @xmath14 in the massless case .",
    "assume that the sphere has radius @xmath15 and the distance between the sphere and the plate is @xmath16 .",
    "then the distance from the center of the sphere to the plate is @xmath17 .",
    "the casimir interaction energy is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19x , y @xmath3 d ( dirichlet ) or n ( neumann ) are the boundary conditions on the sphere and the plate , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22and @xmath23 here @xmath24 and @xmath25 are modified bessel functions , and @xmath26 are associated legendre functions @xcite .",
    "this formula is almost the same as the formula in the massless case .",
    "we only have to replace @xmath27 in the formula for the massless case by the @xmath28 given by .",
    "one can use this same rule to obtain the formula of the casimir interaction energy for massive scalar field from the corresponding formula for the massless scalar field .",
    "notice that as in the massless case , we can rewrite @xmath29 as @xmath30where @xmath31 can be expressed in terms of @xmath32-symbols : @xmath33however , we will prefer the representation since it is easier to compute the small separation asymptotic behavior using .",
    "in this section , we derive the small separation asymptotic expansion of the casimir interaction energy .",
    "introduce the dimensionless variables @xmath34 we have @xmath35 now expanding the logartihm in and replacing summations by integrations , we have @xmath36here we have reparametrized the variables : @xmath37 now using the integral representation ( see @xcite ) @xmath38 we find that @xmath39 let @xmath40 so that @xmath41 also , we need to make a change of variables @xmath42 where @xmath43 now we can expand every term in small @xmath44 , keeping in mind that @xmath45 has order @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 have order @xmath49 . in the following ,",
    "we denote by @xmath50 and @xmath51 terms of order @xmath52 and @xmath44 . with the help of symbolic mathematics softwares ,",
    "we find that @xmath53 similarly , we have @xmath54 on the other hand , @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 using debye asymptotic expansions for modified bessel functions @xcite : @xmath59where @xmath60we find that @xmath61 here @xmath62 are terms of order @xmath44 .    collate everything , sum over @xmath13 and @xmath63 from 0 to infinity using @xmath64 and then integrate over @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , we find that @xmath68 substitute into , we find that @xmath69 after integrating over @xmath47 and @xmath48 , this gives @xmath70@xmath71 is a term of order @xmath44 .",

    "[ f1 ] , we plot the leading term normalized by the massless leading term as a function of @xmath94 .",
    "one observe that when the mass increases , the magnitude of the casimir interaction energy decreases .",
    "define @xmath95 the ratio of the next - to - leading order term to the leading order term dividing by @xmath96 , so that @xmath97 this is a good measure of the deviation from the proximity force approximation . in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , we plot the dependence of @xmath6 on @xmath94 . we observe that @xmath98 and @xmath99 are positive , while @xmath100 and @xmath101 are negative . moreover , their magnitudes are decreasing functions of @xmath94 .",
    "this implies that the correction to proximity force approximation becomes smaller when the mass is large .",
    "the casimir interaction energy density of massive scalar field between two parallel plates separated by a distance @xmath16 is given by @xmath102where x , y = d or n are the boundary conditions on the plates , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath103 using the fact that @xmath104where @xmath105 , we find that the proximity force approximation to the casimir interaction energy between a sphere and a plate is @xmath106here we have made the change of variables @xmath107 .",
    "compare to , we find that the leading order term of the casimir interaction energy indeed coincides with that derived using proximity force approximation .",
    "the formulas and give respectively the leading order term and the next - to - leading order terms of the casimir interaction energy between a sphere and a plate .",
    "these formulas involve integration and summation and the dependence on mass is not obvious . to get a better picture on the dependence of the casimir interaction energy on mass , we derive here the asymptotic expansions of these formulas when the mass @xmath48 is small , or more precisely , when the dimensionless variable @xmath108 is small .    making the change of variables @xmath109 and using the formula @xmath110 we find that @xmath111 using the formula @xmath112 we then find that @xmath113 similarly , we have @xmath114 from these , we can compute the small @xmath94 asymptotic expansions by taking residues at the poles of the integrands .",
