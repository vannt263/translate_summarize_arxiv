    "many of these computational cell models contain 10 or more components as the important roles of many different ion channels have been discovered since the appearance of the hh model .",
    "analysis of such higher - dimensional models is very complex as there may be 50 or more parameters in distinction to the relatively few in the 4-component hodgkin - huxley system .",
    "since the latter does in fact embrace some of the basic firing properties of neurons in general , there has naturally been a large number of analyses and computational studies of the hh systems .",
    "these include both deterministic ( for example , @xcite ) and stochastic ( for example , @xcite ) modeling .    in recent articles @xcite",
    "we have explored the effects of both additive gaussian white noise and conductance noise on repetitive firing in the hodgkin - huxley system . in the additive noise case for the ordinary differential equation ( ode ) model , when the mean input current density @xmath7 is not far above the threshold of 6.4 @xmath7a/@xmath8 for repetitive firing , the number of spikes in the first 500 or 1000 ms was found to undergo a pronounced minimum ( isr ) as the noise level @xmath1 increased from zero @xcite .",

    ", the exact distribution of @xmath36 can be found at any @xmath10 .",
    "between spikes the linearized system ( 17)-(18 ) is expected to provide a reasonable approximation to the fully nonlinear system ( 1)-(4 ) .",
    "this is clearly demonstrated by the two sets of sample paths shown in figure 2 . with input parameters",
    "@xmath0 , @xmath37 , a time segment of length about 60 ms gave the sample path for @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) shown in the top part of the figure . with the same path for the wiener process ( or the white noise ) , the sample path for the voltage @xmath40 in the linearized system , with the same initial values , is seen in the lower part of figure 2 , to mimic closely that in the upper part .",
    "however , there is one very striking difference betwen the two paths as at about @xmath41 ms the voltage in the linear system attains a local maximum and then decreases quite rapidly , continuing in an oscillatory fashion . in contrast , at about the same @xmath10 and voltage values , a spike arises in the nonlinear system .",
    "however , these paths indicate that the time of spiking in the nonlinear system can be well approximated as the time at which the voltage in the linear sytem first attains a threshold value .",
    "such a first passage time can be determined from the usual first exit time theory for diffusion processes .          without an imposed threshold condition ,",
    "no spikes are possible in the linearized stochastic system described by ( 17 ) and ( 18 ) because there is only a stable equilibrium point about which trajectories fluctuate .",
    "this is of course in distinction to the hodgkin - huxley system ( with suitable input parameters ) where trajectories may , if the fluctuations are large enough , give rise to spikes around the limit cycle .",
    "it is of interest to examine some statistical properties of the original process @xmath42 in nonspiking periods .",
    "an example of paths with @xmath0 and @xmath43 over a 50 ms nonspiking period is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the basic statistical properties of the components over a 500 ms time period are given in table 1 . in table 2",
    "are given the corresponding correlation coefficients .",
    "h ]    period .",
    "@xmath43    .statistics of variables during non - spiking [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     there are two very noticeable features of the sample paths in the nonspiking periods examined .",
    "firstly , the oscillatory character of the paths , which is traceable to the eigenvalues of the jacobian at the equilibrium point . secondly , the strong positive correlation between @xmath38 and @xmath44 and the strong negative correlation between @xmath45 and @xmath46 .        the oscillatory nature of the paths can never be captured in the standard integrate and fire models nor the leaky integrate and fire models @xcite .",
    "when the noise is sufficiently large to make for fairly frequent spiking , the times of spiking must tend to arise at the maxima in the oscillations of @xmath38 .",
    "this is seen dramatically in figure 3 and in figure 2 of the previous subsection .",
    "examination of the statistical properties of the process as given in tables 1 and 2 shows that for small noise the coefficients of variation of @xmath45 and @xmath46 are an order of magnitude smaller than those for @xmath38 and @xmath44 and that the correlation coefficient of @xmath38 and @xmath44 is close to unity .",
    "these observations make it reasonable to consider a 1-dimensional approximation @xmath47 to the hh system in which a constant @xmath48 and a constant @xmath49 , with @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is another constant .",
    "these approximations lead , on putting @xmath52 in ( 1 ) , to the following stochastic differential equation for @xmath47 , d= ( + c_1 - c_2 + c_3 ^ 3 - c_4 ^ 4)dt + dw , where c_1= _ k^4v_k + g_lv_l c_2= _ k^4 + g_l c_3= _ nak^3v_na c_4= _ nak^3 .",
    "standard theory gives for such a diffusion that the mean exit time from a value @xmath53 to outside this interval satisfies the ordinary differential equation ( ^2/2)m+ ( + c_1 - c_x + c_3x^3 - c_x^4)m=-1 , x(a , b ) , where primes denote differentiation , along with suitable boundary conditions .",
    "preliminary investigations of the validity of this approximation were made using values for @xmath0 and @xmath43 ( see tables 1 and 2 ) but a detailed study will be reported in a subsequent article .      with constant input current density in the interval @xmath54 ,",
    "repetitive spiking may occur with a fixed period . for @xmath0 and",
    "no noise the period is about 17.65 ms .",
    "the limit cycle is in 4-space but we here show in the upper part of figure 2 the projection of the limit cycle obtained by plotting @xmath45 versus @xmath38 . in the lower part of the figure is shown the position of the stable equilibrium point , here designated r , for the same value of @xmath7 .",
    "it can be seen that the limit cycle approaches quite close to r. in a previous article in which the moment method was used to explore the effects of noise on hh spiking ( tuckwell and jost , 2009 ) , we heuristically estimated the basin of attraction of the stable equilibrium point .",
    "part of the basin of attraction of the limit cycle can be numerically estimated by taking the union of all stochastic paths which do not collapse to the stable equilibrium point . as explained later , there are ranges of values of @xmath1 where the stochastic paths have this property and figure 6 shows a sample of such paths for various such @xmath1 . here",
    "paths were taken over 1000 msec involving about 50 spikes for values of @xmath1 ranging from 0.05 to 0.25 .",
    "this picture gives an idea of how far off the deterministic limit cycle a path may wander without entering the basin of attraction of the stable equilibrium point .",
    "the variability of paths is relatively small .            another way to see the limited variability of the times to complete a spike orbit ( limit cycle )",
    "is displayed in figure 7 . here",
    "spikes were observed during repetitive firing during periods in which no transitions to the basin of attraction of the rest point occurred , with noise levels from @xmath55 to @xmath56 .",
    "the statistical properties of the interspike interval ( isi ) are shown in the figure .",
    "the most salient feature is that the mean isi is practically constant ( blue triangles ) as the noise varies , staying in the interval @xmath57 $ ] for these values of @xmath1 .",
    "naturally the standard deviation of the isi increases ( green squares ) as @xmath1 increases , the maximum isi increases /red circles ) and the minimum isi decreases ( black diamonds ) .",
    "examples of distributions of the isi during repetitive spiking at small noise levels are shown in figure 8 . in the top panel",
    "is an isi histogram for a noise level ( @xmath58 ) at which there is apparently no cessation of spiking over extremely long ( infinite ? ) time periods with 28429 isis in 500000 ms .",
    "the distribution is roughly gaussian and has a mean of 17.59 ms and a standard deviation of 0.221 ms . for the second histogram shown , @xmath59 , which is just greater than the critical value at which spiking may stop in a finite time .",
    "the number of spikes is only 4397 and the mean and standard deviation of the isi are 17.60 ms and 0.276 ms , respectively .",
    "the distribution of the isi is practically the same in both cases .",
    "in the following it is assumed that @xmath7 is such that repetitive spiking does in fact occur . in relation to the stochastic paths for the hh system of stochastic equations we define the following two random variables .",
    "firstly , the exit time of the process to escape from the basin of attraction @xmath60 of the limit cycle l to that @xmath61 of the rest point r is by t_lr ( x_0 ) , x_0 b_l where @xmath62 is an initial point .",
    "secondly the exit time for the process to escape from the basin of attraction @xmath61 of r to that of the limit cycle is t_r l ( x_0 ) , x_0 b_r .",
    "using the standard theory for diffusion processes , kolmogorov second order partial differential equations for the moments and distributions of these quantities as a function of initial values were described in our previous work ( tuckwell et al . , 2009 ) .",
    "however , any attempt to solve these equations analytically or even by numerical methods for pdes , apart from being a formidable task , requires an exact or even approximate knowledge of the two basins of attraction which is unfortunately not presently available .",
    "in fact the probabilistic nature of @xmath60 and @xmath61 is not completely understood because it seems that for small enough noise , at least for some values of @xmath7 , escape from @xmath60 may be impossible , not being observed in extremely long time periods and similarly , for particular ranges of @xmath1 , for escape from @xmath61 .",
    "we are interested in obtaining samples of meaningful sizes for the above random variables and determining their properties , mainly as a function of @xmath1 . since some of the exits from one basin of attraction to the other are , for some values of @xmath1 , very rare events the simulations of solutions of the full stochastic hh system have to be performed over very long time periods .",
    "these were chosen to be 500000 ms or about 8 minutes and 20 seconds with a timestep of 0.065 ms .",
    "results for the 500000 ms interval were obtained as the union of 100 trials of length 5000 ms , where the final values of @xmath63 from any trial were used as the initial values for the next trial .",
    "then the data on @xmath64 for the 100 trials were concatenated to give 5 single vectors each with over 7.5 million elements .",
    "the records for @xmath38 were analyzed to determine the times of occurrence of spikes and from these the interspike intervals were determined . in total , 50 trials of length 500000 were simulated .",
    "the numbers of spikes were recorded in each of 50 trials of length 500000 ms for 40 values of @xmath1 .",
    "the mean number of spikes , denoted by e[nsp ] , is plotted against @xmath1 in figure 9 . in the top panel",
    "all results are included , whereas in the lower left panel detail is shown for @xmath65 and in the lower right panel , for @xmath66 .",
    "the general form of the plot of e[nsp ] versus @xmath1 is similar to that in figure 5 of tuckwell et al .",
    "( 2009 ) where the total time period was much less at 1000 ms .",
    "thus , figure 9 exhibits the phenomenon of inverse stochastic resonance , which refers to a firing rate which , as noise level increases , at first declines to a minimum and then becomes greater .",
    "however , figure 9 shows more detail and reveals 4 distinct regimes marked @xmath4, ... ,@xmath67 . in region",
    "@xmath4 , which extends from the deterministic setting of @xmath68 to very close to @xmath58 , the noise is almost without effect and the number of spikes is always close to that for the zero noise , 28431 .",
    "region @xmath69 is characterized by a rapidly falling number of spikes as @xmath1 increases from 0.07 to 0.14 . at the latter value of @xmath1",
    "the mean number of spikes is 104.8 which is about 0.4% of the maximum value . in region @xmath3 , from @xmath70 to @xmath71 , e[nsp ] stays below 100 with a broad minimum of about 9.5 spikes ( 0.03% of the maximum ) around @xmath72 to 0.300 .",
    "by @xmath73 , the beginning of region @xmath67 , the mean number of spikes has reached over 120 and then increases sharply and eventually at a slower rate to reach 25883 around @xmath74 .",
    "the following observations constitute a basis for isr which occurs at some values of @xmath7 in the hh system described by equations ( 1)-(4 ) .",
    "we define two critical values @xmath75 and @xmath76 of the noise parameter @xmath1 , with @xmath77 @xmath75 and @xmath76 depend on @xmath7 , and are only relevant above the critical value for repetitive firing and possibly for selected initial values of the process ( see tuckwell et al . , 2009 ) .",
    "with reference to the two random variables defined by ( 26 ) and ( 27 ) , but without any specific values of @xmath78 , we have the following , as schematized diagrammatically in figure 10 .    @xmath79 . +",
    "repetitive spiking continues , presumably indefinitely .",
    "+ the probability of a transition from @xmath60 to @xmath61 at any time is zero .",
    "+ the expectation of @xmath80 , is infinite .",
    "v@xmath81 + repetitive spiking ceases at some time @xmath82 .",
    "+ the probability of a transition from @xmath60 to @xmath61 is greater than zero and increases with noise level .",
    "+ the expectation of @xmath80 , is finite and and tends to decrease with increasing @xmath1 .",

    "+ the expectation of @xmath83 , is infinite .",
    "+ after the cessation of repetitive spiking , there is no more spiking .",
    "+ after a transition from @xmath60 to @xmath61 , the probability of a transition from @xmath61 to @xmath60 is greater than zero and tends to increase as @xmath1 incresases .",
    "+ the expectation of @xmath83 , is finite and tends to decrease as @xmath1 increases .",
    "+ after a transition back from @xmath61 to @xmath60 , the reverse transition occurs with non - zero pobability , followed again by a transition from @xmath60 to @xmath61 and so forth , indefinitely .",
    "+ epochs of spiking and nonspiking alternate with variable durations which tend to become shorter as @xmath1 increases .",
    "figure 10 illustrates some of these aspects .",
    "the bottom panel shows part of the actual e[nsp ] curve ( normalized ) from figure 9 and the approximate values of @xmath85 and @xmath86 are obtained from this curve . in the top panel ,",
    "the probabilities of transitions from @xmath60 to @xmath61 and @xmath61 to @xmath60 are indicated as commencing to increase from zero at the two critical values of @xmath1 and rising to unity , although this final value depends on the initial value @xmath87 which is not fixed throughout . in the middle panel , descriptions of the expectations of the exit times from @xmath60 and @xmath61 are given .",
    "the scheme given in figure 10 is in accordance with the results for sample paths of @xmath38 for simulated spike trains shown in figure 11 . here",
    "the time periods are all 500000 ms but in the top two records time is only shown to 2000 ms .",
    "the very small noise case gives apparently indefinite repetitive spiking .",
    "somewhat larger noise leads to an initial isolated burst followed by silence , possibly for an infinite time . increasing the noise further leads to occasional bursting and",
    "eventually the frequent bursting case occurs .          in this",
    "subsection results on certain statistical aspects of the underlying random variables @xmath88 and @xmath89 , defined by ( 26 ) and ( 27 ) , obtained from the long - term simulation of the hh system ( 1)-(4 ) are given .      during",
    "repetitive spiking the trajectories of the process do not deviate much from the deterministic limit cycle as illustrated in figure 6 .",
    "it is assumed that there is a well - defined but unkown set in @xmath90-space , denoted by @xmath60 , containing the deterministic repetitive spiking trajectory , which is called the basin of attraction of the limit cycle .",
    "this implies that if the process started in @xmath60 , then , with no noise , the path would approach the limit cycle . with noise",
    ", trajectories may escape from @xmath60 whereupon they enter the basin of attraction @xmath61 of the stable equilibrium point .",
    "the nature of @xmath60 is unknown and it is not clear that it is a regular open set because if it was it is likely that escape from it would occur eventually with probability one no matter how small the noise level . thus , even though it seems that for @xmath91 , @xmath92 and e[@xmath93 , it may be the case that @xmath94 is so small for small enough @xmath1 that the event of this escape is unlikely to be observed in the course of feasible simulations .",
    "it is a remaining mathematical challenge to ascertain the veracity of these remarks .    notwithstanding these uncertainties ,",
    "the mean value of e[@xmath88 ] of the exit time from @xmath60 was estimated from sample paths and the results are shown for @xmath96 in figure 12 .",
    "for these noise levels the mean exit time declines rapidly from very large values to a minimum of about 57 ms at @xmath97 .",
    "thereafter , e[@xmath88 ] seems to increase slightly to about 72 ms at @xmath74 .",
    "the basin of attraction of the stable rest point is also unknown exactly .",
    "figures 13 and 14 show estimates of the mean and standard deviation of @xmath89 over various ranges of values of @xmath1 .",
    "again , it is not known with certainty , but it appears that the probability of escape from @xmath61 to @xmath60 is zero ( or extremely close to zero ) until @xmath98 . in figure 13 , the mean is shown dropping from values of order 300000 ms at @xmath99 to eventually reach values about 30 ms at @xmath74 .",
    "figure 14 shows corresponding results for the standard deviation , but only for @xmath100 because sample sizes were too small for lesser values of the noise parameter . in the lower panel of figure 14",
    "is shown the dependence of the coefficient of variation of @xmath89 on noise level .",
    "it can be seen that there is an initial increase in this quantity until a maximum is attained at about @xmath101 , whereupon it declines monotonically .",
    "there are three main random variables of interest in relation to the empirical spike trains obtained in this study .",
    "these are the previously defined exit times @xmath88 and @xmath89 and in addition the general isi for the whole train .",
    "samples for the latter random variable can be viewed as the union of those of the previous two .",
    "examples of histograms of these random variables are shown in figure 15 . in all cases the results for 50 trials of duration 500000",
    "ms are combined . in figure 15a",
    "is given a histogram for all isis for @xmath102 .",
    "this occurs in region @xmath3 of figure 9 , where there are very few spikes , all with short isis as there are no returns to @xmath60 fron @xmath61 .",
    "the histogram is of the same nature as those in figure 8 .",
    "see also figure 7 .    in figure 15c the raw histogram",
    "is shown for all isis with @xmath103 .",
    "there is a preponderance of small intervals and then an exponential - type distribution of longer ( @xmath104 ms ) intervals as depicted in figure 15e .",
    "the tail of the exponential distribution is very long and extends out to about 500000 ms which is the limit in these simulations .",
    "the distribution depicted in figure 15e is close to the actual distribution of @xmath89 for this value of @xmath1 .",
    "similar remarks apply to the pairs of figures 15b and 15d ( @xmath73 ) and 15f and 15 g ( @xmath101 ) . in the final plot of figure 15h ,",
    "the number of spikes has become enormous and the majority of isis are less than 50 ms as expected for @xmath105 which is in region @xmath67 of figure 9 . in the histograms of figure 15 c , b , f and h , there are small bin counts out to very large times and these are not visible compared to the large bin count at short intervals",
    ". however , they are visible at relatively small values in the truncated histograms .        to complete the picture for the distributions of the three key random variables , figure 16 shows histograms of mean numbers of spikes per burst for two values , 0.4 and 1.0 , of @xmath1 .",
    "if these are multiplied by the mean isi within bursts , which is about 17.6 ms , the mean times spent in the basin of attraction of the limit cycle ( @xmath60 ) and hence of @xmath88 are estimated . for smaller @xmath1",

    "the first theoretical evidence of isr in the full hh sytem was obtained for @xmath27 in the non - repetitive spiking mode @xcite ( figure 2 ) , as it was found that there was a maximum in the mean isi at small values of @xmath1 .",
    "subsequently isr has been demonstrated for repetitive spiking in both the hh system of odes and pdes @xcite .",
    "in addition to using the standard initial conditions and additive noise , in @xcite the phenomenon was confirmed with respect to random initial conditions and conductance - based input .",
    "some theory of isi was also outlined @xcite in terms of bifurcations in the hh sytem @xcite and of the exit times @xcite from the basins of attraction of a stable equilibrium point and a limit cycle .",
    "however the simulations were over relatively short time periods and the statistical details of the exit times were not explored in detail .    in this article",
    "we have first explored the properties of the stable equilibrium point in depth . linearizing the stochastic hh system about that point gave an approximate sytem of stochastic differential equations whose",
    "oscillatory solutions were found to mimic those of the full system in nonspiking periods .",
    "the oscillations are evidently an integral part of firing in the hh system with the considered parameters , because spikes did tend to emerge at the maxima .",

    "<S> in previous articles we have investigated the firing properties of the standard hodgkin - huxley ( hh ) systems of ordinary and partial differential equations in response to input currents composed of a drift ( mean ) and additive gaussian white noise . for certain values of the mean </S>",
    "<S> current , as the noise amplitude increased from zero , the firing rate exhibited a minimum and this phenomenon was called inverse stochastic resonance ( isr ) . here </S>",
    "<S> we analyse the underlying transitions from a stable equilibrium point to the limit cycle and vice - versa . focusing on the case of a mean input current density @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> at which repetitive firing occurs and isr had been found to be pronounced , some of the properties of the corresponding stable equilibrium point are found . </S>",
    "<S> a linearized approximation around this point has oscillatory solutions from whose maxima spikes tend to occur . </S>",
    "<S> a one dimensional diffusion is also constructed for small noise based on the correlations between the pairs of hh variables and the small magnitudes of the fluctuations in two of them . </S>",
    "<S> properties of the basin of attraction of the limit cycle ( spike ) are investigated heuristically and also the nature of distribution of spikes at very small noise corresponding to trajectories which do not ever enter the basin of attraction of the equilibrium point . </S>",
    "<S> long term trials of duration 500000 ms are carried out for values of the noise parameter @xmath1 from 0 to 2.0 , with results appearing in section 3 . </S>",
    "<S> the graph of mean spike count versus @xmath1 is divided into 4 regions @xmath2 where @xmath3 contains the minimum associated with isr . in @xmath4 noise has practically no effect until a critical value of @xmath5 is reached . at a larger critical value @xmath6 , the probability of transitions from the basin of attraction of the equilibrium point to that of the limit cycle becomes greater than zero and the spike rate thereafter increases with increasing @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the quantitative scheme underlying the isr curve is outlined in terms of exit time random variables and illustrated diagrammatically . in the final subsection 3.4 , several statistical properties of the main random variables associated with long term spiking activity are given , including distributions of exit times from the two relevant basins of attraction and the interspike interval .    </S>",
