    "quantum spin systems with energy gaps have attracted considerable attention because of their rich variety of interesting phenomena . in these systems ,",
    "the ground state is a nonmagnetic singlet state , and there exists a finite energy - gap between the ground and the excited magnetic states . under certain magnetic fields",
    "@xmath3 , the energy of one of the magnetic excited states becomes lower than that of the singlet state , where nonmagnetic - magnetic crossover occurs .",
    "recently , special attention is paid to the magnetic transition that develops just above @xmath3 in these spin - gap systems .",
    "@xcite a number of novel phenomena is reported in these fields ; for example , magnetic ordering of tlcucl@xmath11 in fields is interpreted as the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of magnons .",
    "@xcite for the two dimensional dimer system srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath11)@xmath0 , superlattice formation of localized triplet is observed .",
    "@xcite    the haldane systems , i.e. , quasi - one - dimensional heisenberg antiferromagnets with integer spins , also are ones of the most extensively studied spin gap systems . for this class , unfortunately , field - induced magnetic ordering has hardly been observed experimentally . the archetypal haldane - system , ni(c@xmath0h@xmath1n@xmath0)@xmath0no@xmath0(clo@xmath12 ) ( nenp ) ,  @xcite shows no evidence of field - induced ordering down to 0.2 k in fields up to 13 t.  @xcite instead , the existence of an energy gap was revealed even at @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite this is explained by the existence of a staggered field on ni sites , which arises because the principal axis of the @xmath13 tensor in nenp tilts alternately .",
    "@xcite this fact results in the slow crossover from nonmagnetic to magnetically polarized state in nenp , preventing from phase transition induced by fields .",
    "so far , field - induced ordering in haldane - systems was reported only for two cases : in ni(c@xmath14h@xmath15n@xmath0)@xmath0n@xmath11(pf@xmath16 ) and ni(c@xmath14h@xmath15n@xmath0)@xmath0n@xmath11(clo@xmath12 ) , abbreviated ndmap and ndmaz , respectively .",
    "field - induced transitions in these systems were demonstrated by specific heat  @xcite and neutron diffraction experiments .",
    "@xcite in the ordered state , interestingly , unusual spin excitations are observed .",
    "esr  @xcite and inelastic neutron - scattering experiments  @xcite on ndmap have revealed the existence of three distinct excitations in the ordered phase .",
    "this feature is quite different from those in a conventional neel state , where dominant excitations are the spin - wave modes .",
    "@xcite field - induced ordered phase in haldane - systems is thus expected to illustrate much kind of novel physics , if much more examples are available .    here",
    "the compound pbni@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 would be another candidate for the haldane system where field - induced ordering can be observed experimentally .",
    "pbni@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 has a tetragonal crystal structure with ni@xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) ions forming a chain along the @xmath9-axis .",
    "magnetic susceptibility , high - field magnetization , and inelastic neutron scattering experiments were performed and their results consistently suggest that this system is a haldane - gap system .",
    "@xcite the spin - gap closes at @xmath19 t and @xmath20 t ,  @xcite where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the critical fields applied parallel and perpendicular to the chain ( @xmath9-axis ) , respectively .",
    "these values of @xmath3 are within experimentally accessible range .",
    "moreover , pbni@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 is reported to exhibit impurity - induced magnetic transition around 3 k.  @xcite this transition was found to be a long - range magnetic ordering by the neutron diffraction  @xcite as well as the specific heat measurements  @xcite .",
    "these facts suggest the relatively large interchain coupling , @xmath23 .",
    "in fact , the @xmath24 plot  @xcite ( sakai - takahashi diagram ) for this compound , where @xmath10 is the single - ion anisotropy , suggests that pbni@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 is in the spin - liquid ( disordered ) regime but very close to the long - range ordered regime .",
    "@xcite hence , one can expect that applying fields beyond @xmath3 will result in the magnetic ordering . in the present paper , we have investigated magnetic properties of pbni@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 at @xmath4 using temperature dependent measurements of magnetization in static fields up to 30 t , and have observed indication of magnetic ordering above @xmath3 .",
    "field - oriented powder sample of pbni@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 was prepared as in the first report ,  @xcite since single crystalline samples are not yet available .",
    "powder sample of pbni@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 was synthesized by a solid state reaction from pbo ( 99.999% pure ) , nio ( 99.99% ) and v@xmath0o@xmath14 ( 99.99% ) .",
    "they were mixed and heated in air , firstly at 600@xmath25c and subsequently at 750@xmath25c for several days with intermittent grindings .",
    "powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) pattern agrees well with the calculated pattern based on the structure refined by the neutron diffraction experiments ,  @xcite and no second phase was detected .",
    "the powder was aligned by a magnetic fields ( 6 t ) in stycast .",
    "the orientation was checked by the ( 004 ) xrd peak .",
    "the result confirmed that the @xmath9-axis aligns parallel to the magnetic fields , as is reported previously .",
    "@xcite in the following , we refer to magnetization measured under fields parallel to the @xmath9-axis , as @xmath26 , and to that under fields perpendicular to the @xmath9-axis , as @xmath27 .",
    "magnetization was measured by an extraction method .",
    "magnetic fields up to 15 t were generated by a superconducting magnet .",
    "fields higher than 15 t were generated by a hybrid magnet at the tsukuba magnet laboratory .",
    "for the measurements of magnetization as a function of magnetic fields , the fields were swept at the rate about 0.3 tesla per minute at the temperature of 1.5 k. for the temperature - dependent measurements , magnetization was measured under constant magnetic fields .",
    "field dependence of the magnetization of the pbni@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 powder samples.,width=302 ]        fig.1 shows field dependence of the magnetization @xmath28 and @xmath29 measured at @xmath6 = 1.5 k. both the @xmath28 and @xmath29 curves steeply increase above the critical fields , @xmath30 = 19 t and @xmath31 = 13.5 t , respectively .",
    "these values correspond to the critical fields at which the haldane gap closes , and are in good agreement with the previous report obtained by the pulsed - field experiments .",
    "@xcite    here the @xmath32 just above @xmath33 increases almost linearly with @xmath34 .",
    "this behavior differs from the theoretical predictions , where @xmath32 varies as proportional to @xmath35 for axially symmetric fields ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "@xcite one of the reason of this discrepancy can be the finite temperature effect .",
    "the @xmath35 dependence easily becomes invisible by a slight thermal excitation , as is observed in ndmaz .",
    "@xcite other origins can be imperfect powder orientation , that can lead axially - asymmetric fields even for @xmath7 .",
    "however , it is also possible that the linear @xmath32 is intrinsic behavior of an antiferromagnetically ordered system .",
    "when the measured temperature is sufficiently low compared to the energy gap , the system promptly enters the antiferromagnetic ordered regime above @xmath33 , as is shown below .",
    "fig.2(a ) shows temperature dependence of the magnetization measured under fields parallel to the @xmath9-axis , @xmath36 . for @xmath37 t ,",
    "the @xmath36 curves show no anomalies . below 5 k ,",
    "@xmath36 have small but finite values ( 0.02 - 0.03@xmath38 ) , and these are attributed to the saturation magnetization of impurity and/or defects . for @xmath34 = 22 t , there exists a cusp - like minimum at around @xmath5 = 6.4 k. with increasing fields , @xmath5 shifts to higher temperatures systematically .",
    "@xmath5 reaches to 11.5 k at @xmath34 = 30 t , as is seen in the figure .",
    "fig.2(b ) shows temperature dependence of the magnetization measured under fields perpendicular to the @xmath9-axis , @xmath39 .",
    "similar to the above results , @xmath40 also exhibits a cusp - like minimum for @xmath41 = 13.5 t .    in both fig.2 ( a ) and ( b )",
    ", @xmath2 shows a sharp change in its slope at @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , below @xmath5 , @xmath2 increases with decreasing @xmath6 showing a convex curve , as is most clearly seen in @xmath40 at @xmath34 = 30 t ( fig.2 ( b ) ) .",
    "such @xmath2 curves quite resemble those field - induced magnetic ordering of the coupled dimers tlcucl@xmath11 .",
    "@xcite in this compound , it is demonstrated that @xmath5 at which @xmath2 has a minimum is the nel temperature , from the neutron diffraction  @xcite and the specific heat measurements .",
    "@xcite similarly , such cusp - like anomalies in @xmath2 curves are shown to be the ordering temperature in the @xmath42 alternating chain pb@xmath0v@xmath11o@xmath43 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) and the quasi-2-dimensional bacusi@xmath0o@xmath16 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) from specific heat measurements .",
    "we hence conclude that the data shown in fig.2 also demonstrate the occurrence of field - induced magnetic ordering with nel temperatures around @xmath5 .",
    "it is notable that the haldane system ndmap exhibits a minimum in @xmath2 for @xmath4 at temperatures much higher than @xmath44 .",
    "@xcite the origin of the minimum is not yet clear , and possibly related to a crossover into the low - temperature tomonaga - luttinger(tl ) liquid regime , as is predicted for non - interacting one - dimensional ladders .",
    "@xcite this is purely a one - dimensional phenomenon , and the three - dimensional ordering occurs at much lower temperatures .",
    "@xcite for those cases , @xmath2 curves around @xmath5 are characterized by the relatively broad minimum and the concave curve .",
    "@xcite this is in clear contrast with the cusp - like anomalies and the convex curve below @xmath5 in the present study as well as in those reported for tlcucl@xmath11 etc . , which signals the 3-dimensional magnetic ordering .",
    "it is of course important to perform other experiments in order to verify the magnetic ordering at @xmath5 .",
    "the lack of single crystalline samples makes it difficult to measure the specific heat of this anisotropic compound .",
    "we are then planning to measure the nmr spectra at high fields",
    ".    it may be interesting to compare the ordered - state induced by fields in pbni@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 with that induced by impurity - doping in pbni@xmath45mg@xmath46v@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite it is shown that the ordered - state of the latter has inhomogeneous distribution of magnetic moment , by esr  @xcite and @xmath47sr experiments .",
    "@xcite in addition , the impurity - induced ordered state vanishes at fields higher than @xmath34 = 4",
    "t , where the haldane state with an energy gap recovers .",
    "@xcite in contrast , ordered state observed in the present experiments shows up only above @xmath3 .",
    "the largest value of @xmath5 in the present study is @xmath4810 k for @xmath34 = 30 t , which is much larger than the maximum value of @xmath44 induced by mg - doping , 3.3 k ,  @xcite or the value of @xmath49k , with @xmath50 the number of nearest chains , and @xmath51 the intrachain coupling .",
    "@xcite this fact implies that the field - induced ordering occurs via the developed antiferromagnetic - correlation along the chain , and the ordered moment induced by fields is distributed uniformly on the chain .    in fig.3 , the values of @xmath5 are plotted against the applied fields .",
    "this corresponds to the magnetic phase diagram for pbni@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 . for both of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath5 increases with fields .",
    "it is notable that the phase boundaries for @xmath7 and @xmath8 do not cross each other at least within the field range measured .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with the theoretical calculation by sakai ,  @xcite the @xmath52 phase diagram calculated for a haldane chain with negative @xmath10 .",
    "indeed , @xmath53 is estimated for pbni@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 from inelastic neutron scattering experiments .",
    "@xcite in contrast , it is reported that crossing of the phase boundaries occurs in the phase diagram of ndmap and ndmaz ,  @xcite and is well explained by the theoretical calculation for positive @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite thus , pbni@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 is the first example of field - induced order in the haldane system with negative @xmath10",
    ".     magnetic phase diagram of pbni@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 suggested from the present experiments ( symbols ) .",
    "` afo ' and ` haldane - state ' represent the antiferromagnetically ordered state and the nonmagnetic spin - singlet state with a haldane - gap , respectively .",
    "open symbols represent the data for @xmath7 , and filled ones are for @xmath8 .",
    "circles indicate @xmath5 determined from the @xmath2 curves , while diamonds indicate @xmath3 estimated from the @xmath32 curves .",
    ", width=302 ]    since the early stage of the research of the haldane systems , its magnetic state at @xmath4 has been discussed theoretically in terms of the bec picture .",
    "@xcite in the following , we discuss on the possible condensed state in the ordered phase . in fig.2 ( a ) , one can see that @xmath36 increases below @xmath5 with decreasing @xmath6 .",
    "such increase can not be explained by a conventional mean - field theory ,  @xcite which predicts almost flat @xmath2 below the ordered temperature .",
    "instead , this increase is successfully explained by the magnon bec theory , as to be due to the increase of magnon number as the condensation sets in .",
    "@xcite to apply the magnon bec theory to our case , it is essential that the rotational symmetry around the magnetic field be conserved .",
    "@xcite in the present case , @xmath36 holds this restriction .",
    "it is rather surprising that the @xmath40 also increases below @xmath5 as is seen in fig.2(b ) . here",
    "@xmath34 is applied perpendicularly to @xmath10 , thereby the rotational symmetry of the hamiltonian around @xmath34 is broken . in such cases , magnon bec picture is not assured because the number of bosons is not conserved .",
    "@xcite in fact , the @xmath40 of ndmap does not increase below @xmath44 but becomes flat against @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite such behavior is consistent with the ising - like antiferromagnet that is predicted to develop for @xmath54 .",
    "@xcite for the present system , the similarity of @xmath40 and @xmath36 may be due to the relatively small @xmath10 ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "this point should be studied more carefully .",
    "it should be remarked , however , that the bec picture requires some rigorous conditions .",
    "first , the concentration of magnons must be enough dilute .",
    "@xcite in fact , experiments on kcucl@xmath11 , isostructural of tlcucl@xmath11 , showed that the @xmath2 curve becomes flat below @xmath44 for fields well above @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite this behavior implies that for this dense magnon condition , mean field approximation is a better description .",
    "the bec picture should hence be applied only for the region @xmath55 .",
    "moreover , it is recently argued that some anisotropic interactions arising from spin - orbit coupling like the dzyaloshinsky - moriya(dm ) interaction and/or the staggered @xmath13 effect can be qualitatively modify the bec description , even if the interactions are very weak .",
    "@xcite recent esr measurements on tlcucl@xmath11 have indeed suggested the existence of such interactions .",
    "@xcite for the present case , the screw - like crystal structure of pbni@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 may cause the dm interaction , as is suggested to explain the weak - ferromagnetism in the isostructural srni@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 .  @xcite",
    "we have observed cusp - like anomaly at @xmath5 in the @xmath2 curves for @xmath4 . the value of @xmath5 increases with applied fields .",
    "these observations suggest the evolution of field - induced magnetic ordering in the haldane chain system pbni@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "magnetic phase diagram of this system up to 30 t is presented .",
    "the phase boundaries for @xmath7 and @xmath8 do not cross each other , in qualitative agreement with the @xmath52 phase diagram calculated theoretically for a haldane system with @xmath56 .",
    "@xcite    in the ordered phase , it is revealed that the magnetizations increase with decreasing @xmath6 and the @xmath2 have a convex curve for both the directions @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "these features may support that the magnon bose - einstein condensation picture can be applicable as an approximation for haldane gap systems at least for @xmath7 .",
    "however , possible anisotropic effects including the dzyaloshinsky - moriya interaction can modify the description of the ordered state significantly .    n.t .",
