    "the archeological nature of galaxy evolution studies prevents us from following individual galaxies over time . in consequence",
    "we are only left with snapshots at different lookback times from where we attempt , as excavators , to piece together their evolutionary histories from the motion of different observable quantities and their inter - relationships through different cosmic times .",
    "as morphology correlates with a range of physical properties in galaxies , such as mass , luminosities and particularly color , this suggest that their appearance must embody some important clues about their formation histories .",
    "moreover , the growing acceptance of the notion that the morphological appearance of galaxies may not be a static property set at an early stage of formation , makes it crucial to understand the flow of the morphological mix of galaxies and their observables as a function of redshifts .",
    "the early morphological studies of hst galaxies @xcite set the stage for the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ; @xcite ) to effortlessly resolve galaxies at ever fainter limits thus enabling the study of the morphological demographics of distant galaxies with larger and deeper datasets ( see * ? ? ?",

    "we take advantage of public deep multicolor acs parallel observations to study the morphological color and star formation rate evolution of galaxies at depths comparable to those of the hubble deep fields @xcite , but probing areas many times larger . throughout this paper",
    "we use @xmath7  km  s@xmath8mpc@xmath8 and a flat ( @xmath9 ) cosmology with @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "magnitudes are given in the ab system across the paper .",
    "our analysis is based on the deep acs parallel fields of the near infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ) imaging of the hubble ultra deep field ( udf ) ( go 9803 , pi : thompson ) .",
    "the acs datasets consist of two separate fields around the center of the udf arranged in a mosaiced pattern determined by the nicmos observations of @xmath12 spacing between pointings @xcite .",
    "the resulting coverage of the parallel acs fields as well as the udf and nicmos observations positions are shown in fig  [ fig : diagram ] .",
    "each field comprises 9 , 9 , 18 , and 27 orbits in the f435w ( @xmath13 ) , f606w ( @xmath14 ) , f775w ( @xmath15 ) and f850lp ( @xmath16 ) filters respectively .",
    "the images are publicly available from the stsci archive and were processed using the acs / gto pipeline ( apsis ; @xcite ) which includes object detection , photometry and cataloging using sextractor @xcite .",
    "photometry was calibrated in ab magnitudes using the zeropoints from sirianni et  al .",
    "photometric redshifts were also computed using the bayesian estimator bpz from @xcite . within the deepest regions of the fields",

    "a complete description of the observations and data reduction analysis of the spectroscopic sample is given in @xcite ; here we briefly summarize these observations .",
    "for field # 1 three masks were observed in november 25 and 26 , 2003 from which spectra for a total of 56 galaxies were secured . from these we secured redshifts for 51 , and for a subset of 37 galaxies line strengths and equivalent widths ( ew )",
    "were measured .",
    "targets for the masks were uniformly selected from galaxies within the field with @xmath19 .",

    "the final integrated exposure times per mask were between 7200s and 4800s at a central wavelength of 5500  and spectral coverage of @xmath20  at 5.3  pixel@xmath8 dispersion .      rather than using the color of galaxies as a surrogate for morphological type , in this paper",
    "we exploit the superb ability of acs to resolve and morphologically segregate distant galaxies with no a priori built - in biases in the selection criteria .",
    "we classified galaxies according to their morphologies down to @xmath2 using a two - pronged approach based on visual inspections and automated classifications .",
    "first , galaxies were visually inspected and classified using the medium deep survey ( mds ) scheme as described in @xcite and modified by @xcite ( see  also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . within this system we segregated galaxies into three broad categories : @xmath21 e / s0 which include e , e / s0 and s0 ; @xmath22 spirals : including sa+b , s and sc+d and @xmath23 irr / pec including irregular and peculiar types .",
    "we also limited our sample to objects with @xmath24 confidence in their bpz redshift estimates .",
    "we elaborate on this in the next section . a final catalog containing 1228 galaxies",
    "was visually inspected by one of us ( fm ) in both acs fields .    secondly , we independently investigated the morphologies of galaxies using automated classifications . for this we calculated the central concentration ( @xmath1 ) and asymmetry ( @xmath0 ) parameters for all galaxies using the definitions from @xcite .",
    "our analysis is based on the well - known relationship between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 structural parameters and traditional visual morphologies @xcite we compute asymmetry and concentration using pyca , our own automated python software . the code is designed to compute  from the sextractor products generated by apsis , the detection catalog and associated segmentation image .",
    "however , it can be used with any standard sextractor products and it is publicly availablefelipe / pyca ] .    concentration is computed as the ratio between the flux at 30% of a given radius @xmath25 to the total flux up to that radius @xmath26 .",
    "formally it is defined as , @xmath27 were @xmath28 is the integrated flux within the radius @xmath26 . the determination of the radius @xmath26 up to where to integrate the light is of importance particularly for the asymmetry values .",
    "as we sample galaxies over ever larger cosmic ages , the surface brightness of galaxies at higher redshifts become heavily affected by the well - known @xmath29 cosmological dimming @xcite .",
    "therefore to consistently measure structural parameters of galaxies over similar physical areas at different redshifts , we chose an aperture radius defined as @xmath30 , with @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the @xcite radius and @xmath33 is the ratio of the galaxy average surface brightness , @xmath34 , in an annulus of radius @xmath35 and the mean value up to the same radius , @xmath36 ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the advantage of using a petrosian radius over traditional surface brightness limits ones , such as the holmberg radius ( i.e. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is that it only depends on the galaxy light profile and it is therefore independent of the redshift of observation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a discussion ) .",
    "comparatively accurate results can be obtained using the sextractor kron radius , which in most cases coincides with @xmath37 .",
    "similarly , asymmetry is computed as half of the ratio between the absolute value of subtraction of the image , @xmath38 , and its @xmath39 rotated image around its center , @xmath40 , to the original image , both contained in an elliptical mask of semi - major length @xmath37 .",
    "to avoid variations arising from noise features , the pivot point of the galaxies was computed after the images were smoothed with a gaussian kernel of 1  pixel and then self - subtracted .",
    "formally , our working definition for asymmetry over a galaxy with an intensity matrix @xmath38 can be expressed as , @xmath41 because we use the absolute values of the self - subtracted galaxy residuals , small variations in the image background can appear even in the most symmetric objects , consequently we add a factor @xmath42 to correct for this artificial @xmath0 signal introduced , such as @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the area inside the ellipse mask and @xmath45 is the sky mean standard deviation .",
    "we compute @xmath0 and @xmath1 for all objects in our galaxy sample to a limiting magnitude @xmath2 . to avoid morphological variations resulting from redshifting bandpass ( i.e. morphological @xmath46correction ) , we compute @xmath0 and @xmath1 using the image in the closest available band to the rest - frame @xmath47 derived from the photometric redshift information . in fig .  [",
    "fig : eye - ac ] we show the distribution of asymmetry and concentration for galaxies in field # 1 as function of their visual morphological classes .",
    "we only show structural values for one field to avoid overcrowding in the diagram .",
    "results are similar for field # 2 .",
    "this type of diagram has been extensively used to illustrate and calibrate the morphological segregation of galaxies based purely on machine classifications ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we use this approach to isolate galaxies in the same three equivalent broad visual morphological categories .",
    "the  classification recovers  @xmath48 of the visual classifications in all three categories , with contaminations of @xmath49 from other classes .",
    "we will use this criteria to isolate galaxies based on @xmath50 and compare their properties in the next section .     that maximizes the recovery of visual classes and minimizes the contamination from other morphological types .",
    "numbers inside the figure represent the recovery and contamination percentages of visual classes and from other classes respectively using the  based selection.,width=328 ]",
    "one of the objectives in this paper is to investigate the cosmic star formation history and its dependence on morphological type . to accomplish this we need to obtain reliable sfrs for a large number of galaxies .",
    "because of the faint limits of the sample and the large number of objects involved , securing spectroscopic diagnostic for all of them would be extremely time consuming , and in most cases unfeasible because of their faintness .",
    "instead , we chose to follow an approach that takes advantage of the deep and precise acs multicolor photometric information , and we use ancillary ground - based spectroscopy and uv imaging for a control sample of galaxies to validate our results .",
    "there are several sfr indicators based on transformation between ultraviolet flux and star formation activity ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a discussion and references therein ) .",
    "we opt for computing the sfr for each galaxy using the prescription of @xcite .",
    "this is straightforward and computationally easy to implement , and derived from a constant sfr and a salteper initial mass function with limits @xmath51 .",
    "they define the ultraviolet flux at 1600 , @xmath52 , as the integrated light over a square synthetic filter of width 350  and central rest - frame wavelength at 1600 .",
    "based on this , @xcite provide a direct transformation between a galaxy s sfr and @xmath52 such as @xmath53=10^{-0.4(m_{1600}+18.15)}\\ ] ] and @xmath54 is the @xmath52 corresponding absolute magnitude in ab system .",
    "because our acs filter information only spans between @xmath55 , the galaxies rest - frame uv light only falls into our bluest band for @xmath56 .",
    "however , due to the large number of objects involved in this study and their precise photometry it is possible to derive a general description the galaxies spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "we utilize the galaxy s reconstructed sed from their bpz spectral type , @xmath57 , and based on this we estimated the galaxy s uv light at 1600  and compute their rest - frame @xmath52 flux .",
    "the @xmath57types provided by bpz are a linear combination from a template library of seds .",
    "we use the cwwsb_benitez2003 template set as described in @xcite .",
    "these are based on the templates from @xcite and @xcite consisting of el , sbc , scd , i m , sb3 , and sb2 , which represent the typical seds of elliptical , early / intermediate type spiral , late - type spiral , irregular , and two types of starburst galaxies respectively .",
    "this template set has been modified from earlier bpz versions to remove differences between the predicted colors and those of real galaxies , which results in improved bpz estimates ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "we note that @xcite have followed a similar approach to estimate the uv - sfr using also the template fits from bpz for @xmath58 galaxies in the hudf , but at 1400instead .",
    "however , because new stars are born in dusty regions , their observed uv light can be strongly attenuated and our observed uv sfrs are therefore subject to obscuration . in order to account for this",
    "we must correct the sfr estimates for dust extinction .",
    "we use the empirical relationship between the unobscured far - infrared ( fir ) flux and the intrinsic sfr ( sfr@xmath59 ) prescription by @xcite , as fir light penetrates the dust and provides reliable sfr@xmath59 .",
    "the @xcite empirical formulation between the ( obscured ) observed - uv sfr , sfr@xmath60 , at a given wavelength @xmath61 and their sfr@xmath59 is ,    @xmath62    @xmath63,\\ ] ]    where sfrs are in units of [ m@xmath64yr@xmath8 ] and @xmath66 is the empirical @xcite attenuation law , @xmath67 this improper equation must be solved numerically to obtain the extinction - corrected sfr@xmath59 for a given observed uv sfr@xmath60 .",
    "we compute the corrected sfr for our full sample for @xmath68  using @xmath69 .",
    "this same method has also been used in the hudf for high redshift galaxies ( see coe et  al . 2005 and references therein ) . in the next section",
    "we use the corrected sfr@xmath59 to calculate the star formation density evolution as a function of morphological type .",
    "we compare our sfr estimates obtained using the 1600  flux with independent sfr measurement from traditional ews . for this",
    ", we utilize the ew from the  emission lines to estimate sfr using the prescription from @xcite using the control - sample of galaxies from our ldds2 spectroscopic campaign . in fig",
    "[ fig : oii-1600 ] we show the individual 1600  estimates from our synthetic approach and the ones obtained from  ews . for the majority of galaxies there is good agreement between the two measurements , showing a clear relation between both estimators .",
    "we find that although there are minor discrepancies for individual galaxies , the overall agreement between 1600 and  is quite satisfactory and we estimate out typical uncertainties to be @xmath70 . as in this paper",
    "we target the general properties for the population as a whole rather than the precise characterization of each galaxy , we are confident that our template - based sfr yield meaningful results .",
    "we further investigate our ability to model the galaxies uv light by comparing our synthetic estimates of the uv flux with the observed magnitudes obtained from overlapping galaxy evolution explorer ( galex , @xcite ) observations for the same acs regions .",
    "we retrieved the positions , fuv(1530 ) and nuv ( 2310 ) magnitudes and associated errors in the ab system from the mast / galex web archive and matched them with the galaxies in our acs sample . from a total of 165 galex sources in both fields",
    ", we successfully identified 71 galaxies in our sample with both fuv and nuv magnitudes .",
    "we compute the synthetic magnitudes through the fuv and nuv bandpasses for each of the matched galaxies using the reconstructed seds . in figure",
    "[ fig : galex ] , we show the comparison of real and synthetic values of fuv and nuv .",
    "we find that the real and modeled values agree well , with a nominal mean scatter @xmath71 of 0.31 and 0.36 mags for fuv and nuv respectively .",
    "therefore , we conclude that our uv flux estimates for acs galaxies represent a good description of their real values and can be used as surrogates when measuring the sfr for large samples of galaxies .",
    "there is a plethora of studies that have focused on the evolution of the sfr density , , at intermediate redshifts @xcite and high redshifts @xcite .",
    "these studies have found that sfr rises rapidly from @xmath73 to @xmath74 and peaks somewhere at @xmath75 depending on the role of obscuration and our ability to unearth missing galaxies at higher redshifts . however , there is little information about how the global sf history is distributed into galaxy types ( e.g. according to morphology ) .",
    "only a few attempts have been made to address this issue using relatively small , but deep , sample such as the hubble deep fields ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper we aim to separate the contributions to the global sfr from each of the morphological classes up to @xmath4 .",
    "many studies have addressed the evolution of  in detail and at high redshifts , but a full census of the contribution from individual morphological classes is yet missing .",
    "we calculate the sfr density for each morphological class at given redshift interval @xmath76 as , @xmath77 where we sum the star formation contribution of each galaxy , sfr@xmath78 , for @xmath79 and @xmath80 is the co - moving volume at @xmath81 , the highest redshift at which a given galaxy , @xmath82 , is still brighter than our sample limiting magnitude , @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "we proceed in this fashion for all galaxies , and calculate  for the e / s0 , spirals and irregular / peculiar samples .",
    "we explore the morphological selection calculating  using both the visual morphological classifications and the machine - based selection . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr ] we show the results of  for the visual and automatic classifications .",
    "we also show the total  as well as the contribution of the three subclasses .",
    "we note that e / s0s are , as expected , the lowest contributors to the total regardless of the classification used .",
    "we see from the figure that there are only small differences in  from the two approaches , mostly in the selection of e / s0 and irr / pec .",
    "moreover , the star formation density for early - types shows a modest increase with redshift which seems to flatten out by @xmath4 .",
    "this is not the case of either of the other classes or the global . on the other hand",
    "the irr / pec galaxies show a constant and in step increase with redshift virtually matching the contribution from spirals , the most active group , by @xmath4 .",
    "+     +     +    we investigate the morphological evolution of galaxies using the observed color magnitude diagrams at several redshift intervals .",
    "our motivation arises from the recognition that early - types in clusters exhibit a tight correlation between their colors and magnitudes .",
    "this correspondence , known as the color - magnitude relation ( cmr ) or `` red sequence '' , has been widely used to constrain the ages of galaxies , particularly for cluster ellipticals ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references ) , and in recent years also for field galaxies at different cosmic times ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "galaxies at similar evolutionary stages should have comparable colors , while departures from this can be employed to establish variations in their star formation history and be interpreted as differential evolution within their stellar population , regardless of its origin ( i.e secular evolution or recent mergers ) .",
    "we construct the color magnitude ( cm ) diagrams for  and colors as a function of  at three evenly spaced redshift intervals , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "we chose to avoid the @xmath86 objects because they are highly incomplete and undersampled .",
    "each interval s diagram is a snapshot of the galaxies current evolutionary phase , where dispersions in their color can be interpreted as variations ( or lack of ) in their age and star formation history . despite the relative large width of our redshift bins",
    ", we can use them to provide a general census of the galaxies relative formation stages as a function of their morphology .    in fig",
    "[ fig : cmr ] we plot the diagrams keyed to their visual morphological type , for  in the left panel and  on the right one .",
    "we use the same symbols as in fig .  [",
    "fig : eye - ac ] . when focusing on the red envelope of galaxies , we see that this is dominated by morphologically selected e / s0 galaxies in all redshift bins .",
    "although there is considerable scatter , a red sequence of passively evolved e / s0 is quite distinguishable .",
    "we also show the @xmath87 coma cluster cmr @xcite transformed to the intervals central redshift and transformed from @xmath88 to @xmath89 and @xmath89 accordingly .",
    "we use empirical and synthetic templates @xcite to transform between @xmath90 to @xmath91 and @xmath92 respectively .",
    "the redshifted coma cmr represents a bona - fide benchmark for old and coeval early - type systems . for the highest redshift  interval",
    "we plot the empirical cmr for the @xmath93 cl1252 - 2927 cluster as derived by @xcite . in each of the panels we also show with a solid star the redshifted values of @xmath94 from the combo17 survey @xcite to  at the central redshift of each interval .",
    "this insures that even in our highest redshift bin we are probing galaxies at @xmath95 magnitudes deeper than @xmath96 within the flux limit of our sample .",
    "previous cmr studies of hst morphologically selected field galaxies show similar results .",
    "the @xcite analysis of ellipticals in the hubble deep field north at @xmath97 was the first to report the presence of a red sequence of field ellipticals at that redshift , comprising around @xmath98 of the population of early types .",
    "however , a significant fraction have bluer rest - frame colors , which @xcite later reported to be also coincidental with having large internal color dispersions . in a later larger sample , @xcite using gems observations confirmed the presence of a red sequence dominated by early types ( @xmath99 ) at @xmath100 .",

    "this result favors a view in which most massive ellipticals might have formed at higher redshift and where at least an important fraction of those were already in place at @xmath4 .",
    "however , it is unclear whether bluer early - type galaxies will become the present day massive systems we see in place .",
    "we note that it is unlikely that these bluer systems could be confused with the brightest knots of faint irregular galaxies , as it has been established that acs can efficiently distinguish between such contrasting galaxy types at these limits , and especially in these high signal - to - noise images ( see * ? ? ?",
