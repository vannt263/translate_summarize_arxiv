    "recently , the yang - mills gradient flow method @xcite has continued to develop remarkably . indeed , this method is extremely useful for setting a reference scale , computing the non - perturbative running of the coupling constant  @xcite , definition of energy momentum tensor ( emt ) on the lattice  , calculation of thermodynamics quantities @xcite and so on  @xcite .",

    "<S> . the tree - level @xmath0 improvement can be achieved in a simple manner , where an appropriate weighted average is computed between the plaquette and clover - leaf definitions of the action density @xmath1 measured at every flow time @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we further develop the idea of achieving the tree - level @xmath3 improvement within a usage of actions consisting of the @xmath4 plaquette and @xmath5 planar loop for both the flow and gauge actions . for testing our proposal , we present numerical results of @xmath1 obtained on gauge configurations generated with the wilson and iwasaki gauge actions at three lattice spacings ( @xmath6 and 0.05 fm ) . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that tree - level improved flows significantly eliminate the discretization corrections on @xmath7 in the relatively small-@xmath2 regime for up to @xmath8 . to demonstrate the feasibility of our tree - level improvement proposal , we also study the scaling behavior of the dimensionless combinations of the @xmath9 parameter and the new reference scale @xmath10 , which is defined through @xmath11 for the smaller @xmath12 , _ e.g. _ @xmath13 . it is found that @xmath14 shows a nearly perfect scaling behavior as a function of @xmath15 regardless of types of the gauge action and the flow , after tree - level improvement is achieved up to @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> further detailed study of the scaling behavior exposes the presence of the remnant @xmath16 corrections , which are beyond the tree - level . </S>",
    "<S> although our proposal is not enough to eliminate the @xmath0 effects exactly , we show that the @xmath16 corrections can be well under control even by the simplest tree - level @xmath0 improved flow . </S>"
