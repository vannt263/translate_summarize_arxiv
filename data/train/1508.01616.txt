    "anisotropic properties of two - dimensional ( 2d ) layered materials make them promising in the application of next generation electronic device .",
    "graphene and few - layer graphene ( flg ) have been most intensely studied for thermal management , due to their extraordinarily high in - plane thermal conductivity ( @xmath2 ) @xcite . however , in most practical applications , graphene / flg will be supported by and integrated with insulators , both in un electronic circuitry and heat - spreader applications @xcite .",
    "therefore , thermal energy flow will be limited both by the in - plane thermal conductivity ( @xmath2 ) of the supported graphene / flg and by the thermal boundary resistance ( r ) at the graphene / flg - substrate interface @xcite . due to the exceedingly large surface - to - volume ratio",
    ", @xmath2 is very sensitive to the interactions with the environment . indeed ,",
    "when supported on an amorphous substrate , @xmath2 of the suspended graphene decreased by almost one order of magnitude , from @xmath34000 wm^-1^k^-1^ @xcite to @xmath3600 wm^-1^k^-1^ @xcite .",
    "such a striking reduction in @xmath2 significantly limits the thermal performance of graphene / flg in real applications and arises from the strong scattering of the important heat carrying flexural acoustic ( za ) modes @xcite to the substrate @xcite .",
    "more specifically , it was identified that the phonon relaxation times ( rts ) of graphene za modes are suppressed when supported on a sio@xmath4 substrate .",
    "it was suggested that suitably choosing the substrate material @xcite and modulating its coupling to graphene @xcite may be useful to improve @xmath2 of the supported graphene / flg .",
    "the thermal boundary resistance ( r ) of a graphene / flg - substrate interface is another limiting factor to their thermal performance in devices .",
    "covalent functionalization has been proven to efficiently promote heat transfer between interfaces by introducing additional thermal pathways through the functionalizing molecules @xcite .",
    "for example , self - assembled - monolayers ( sam ) were used to functionalize metallic surfaces to enhance heat transport across metal - water @xcite , metal - gas @xcite , metal - semiconductor @xcite and metal - polymer @xcite interface .",
    "functionalization was used in graphene and cnt nanocomposites to mitigate the high thermal boundary resistance between the graphene / cnt fillers and the polymer matrices @xcite .",
    "functionalized molecules help align and densely pack multilayer graphene sheets and reduce the interlayer thermal resistance of graphene @xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown that plasma - functionalized graphene was shown to increase the cross - plane thermal conductance between aluminum and its substrate by a factor of two @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the functionalization - introduced point defects will further decrease @xmath2 of the supported graphene / flg , as they introduce phonons scattering centers @xcite .    to make progress , a robust solution that maintains the high thermal conductivity of graphene / flg when supported , while effectively reducing the thermal interface resistance",
    "is needed . in this study",
    ", we theoretically and experimentally investigate the basal - plane thermal conductivity and membrane - substrate thermal resistance of graphene film covalently linked to a silane - functionalized graphene oxide ( fgo ) support ( figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "intuitively , we might expect that attaching a molecule to a graphene surface would increase phonon scattering and reduce @xmath2 .",
    "we report here a counter - intuitive increase of @xmath5 in the supported graphene films with silane functionalization .",
    "we attribute this unexpected phenomenon to the silane functionalization , which mediates the graphene film - fgo substrate scattering and recovers the long graphene za modes relaxation time .",
    "our model demonstrates that with a large number density @xmath6 of molecules , the overall in - plane thermal conductivity @xmath2 of the graphene - based film is enhanced by @xmath3 15% with the presence of the fgo substrate , whereas its thermal resistance @xmath7 with the substrate falls below that without the functionalization .",
    "both phenomena indicate that graphene film - silane - fgo structures is a useful tool for optimizing thermal management .",
    "a graphene membrane bonded to the fgo substrate through silane molecules is shown in figure [ fig1](a ) and ( b ) . to synthesize experimentally a graphene - based film and fgo ( figure [ fig1]c )",
    ", we first prepared a graphene oxide ( go ) dispersion ( see experimental section ) .",
    "the fgo was obtained by functionalizing go with a silane - based chemistry suitable for reactive oxide - forming surfaces including the basal plane of go and sio~2~. silane is widely used as a coupling agent to improve the adhesion performance of the interfaces .",
    "the fgo layer has a thickness of @xmath3 5 nm . the graphene film was obtained after chemical reduction of the go .",
    "the graphene film was then spin - coated @xcite with the fgo and the resulting bundle was transferred to a thermal evaluation device @xcite , resulting in the formation of molecular bridges between the graphene surface and the device s sio~2~ substrate .",
    "the thermal evaluation device was integrated with micro pt - based heating resistors as the hot spot and temperature sensors @xcite , acting as a simulation platform of an electronic component to demonstrate the heat - spreading capability of the supported graphene film .",
    "[ fig1](c ) shows the temperature measured in situ at the hot spot and compares the thermal performance of the graphene - film with and without the functionalization . with a constant heat flux of 1300 w cm^-2^ at the pt hot spot ,",
    "the temperature at the hot spot decreased from @xmath8c to @xmath9c ( @xmath10c ) with the graphene film only as heat spreader .",
    "in contrast , by chemically bonding the graphene film to the fgo substrate , the hot spot was cooled down from @xmath11c to @xmath12c ( @xmath13c ) .",
    "the heat - spreading performance is thus enhanced by @xmath350% .",
    "we have implemented a finite - element ( fem ) model ( see section v in @xcite ) of the heat spreading device by taking the results of atomistic simulation as input parameters . as shown in figure  [ fig1](c )",
    ", the heat - spreading performance of the equivalent macroscopic fem model agrees reasonably well with the one measured by experiments .    to explore the physics behind this counter - intuitive increase of @xmath2 in the supported graphene film with silane functionalization , we first performed molecular dynamic ( md ) simulations to study a nanoscale molecular junction between two stacks of multi - layer graphene nanoflakes .",
    "we replaced the graphene oxide by pristine graphene for the simplication of computation .",
    "this simplication is relevant since the oxidation of substrate has a minor impact on the in - plane and cross - plane thermal transport in the supported graphene - based film which we are interested in .",
    "we consider defect - free and isotopically pure graphene flakes of 10@xmath1410 nm^2^ thermalized at 300 k ( see methods and @xcite section i ) .",
    "the fgo substrate has a 5 nm thickness as in the experiments .",
    "conventional silica substrate results in a substantial decrease of the basal - plane thermal conductivity of graphene due to the non - conformality of the substrate - graphene interface @xcite . for the sake of comparison",
    ", the fgo substrate proposed herein minimizes the perturbation of substrate on the morphology of graphene ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) ) , thus maintaining its high thermal conductivity .",
    "periodic boundary conditions were used in the in - plane directions so that the md system corresponds to two thin films connected through silane molecules with the number density @xmath6 , defined as the number of molecules per graphene unit area .    to illustrate the intriguing role of the functionalizing molecule ,",
    "the in - plane thermal conductivity @xmath2 of the film and its interfacial thermal resistance @xmath7 @xcite ( supplemental information section i ) with the fgo substrate from md simulation combined with linear response theory is plotted as a function of the graphene layer number @xmath15 in the film in figure  [ fig2 ] ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "first a supercell containing a single molecule is studied , which corresponds to @xmath16 nm^-2^. for @xmath17 , the presence of the molecule results in an unexpected increase both in the graphene film thermal conductivity @xmath2 and in @xmath7 .",
    "an overall decaying trend of the in - plane thermal conductivity @xmath2 of the graphene film and its resistance @xmath7 with the substrate versus the layer number @xmath15 is observed until the value of bulk graphite is approached .",
    "this is due to the increased cross - plane coupling of the low - energy phonons .",
    "a similar decay was found both in experimental measurements of @xmath2 @xcite of suspended graphene and in simulation - based estimates of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "unlike silica - supported graphene@xcite , the few - layer graphene on a functionalized graphene oxide support recovers the high thermal conductivity and follow the same decaying trend versus @xmath15 as the suspended graphene @xcite .",
    "therefore the proposed fgo substrate maintains the high thermal conductivity of graphene compared to a silica substrate .",
    "for @xmath18 , the presence of the molecule reduces @xmath2 , in contrast to the case where no molecule interconnects the graphene film and the substrate .",
    "this breakdown of the thermal conductivity enhancement is due to a saddle - like surface generated around the molecule s chemical bonds of amino and silano groups connecting the graphene , with the bond center as the saddle point , as shown in the inset a of figure  [ fig2 ] ( a ) .",
    "the saddlelike surface strongly scatters the za phonons , thus decreasing @xmath2 of the graphene film .",
    "such a curved surface is common in defective graphene @xcite , resulting from the jahn - teller effect to lower the energy by geometrical distortion @xcite .",
    "the thermal conductance of a single silane molecule is determined to be 82 pw k@xmath19 through the molecular footprint @xcite ( supplemental information section vi ) .",
    "our simulated result is comparable to recent measurements of the thermal conductance of alkane thiols sam at a silica - gold interface@xcite .",
    "we investigate the microscopic origin of the thermal conductivity @xmath2 enhancement in the graphene film by probing the mode - wise phonon relaxation time ( rt ) @xcite ( supplemental information section iii ) .",
    "the phonon rt @xmath20 measures the temporal response of a perturbed phonon mode to relax back to equilibrium due to the net effect of different phonon scattering mechanisms .",
    "@xmath20 can be defined as @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the phonon occupation numbers out of and at thermal equilibrium . under the single - mode - relaxation - time approximation , the thermal conductivity",
    "is defined by @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the specific heat per volume unit and the group velocity of the @xmath27-th phonon mode .",
    "the phonon dispersion of the supported graphene film for @xmath16 nm^-2^ and @xmath15=2 and the extracted rt @xmath20 for all the phonon modes at 300 k are shown in figure [ fig3 ] . by inserting the molecule , the rt of the acoustic flexural modes @xmath28 largely increases at low frequencies ( @xmath29 thz ) whereas the longitudinal and transverse modes undergo a slight decrease in @xmath30 .",
    "the notable increase in @xmath28 accounts for the enhancement in @xmath2 of the graphene film bonded to the substrate since the za modes contribute considerably to @xmath2 as much as 77% at 300 k @xcite .",
    "we attribute the increase in @xmath28 to the weakened coupling between the graphene film and the substrate , which is reflected by the increased thermal resistance @xmath7 for @xmath16 nm^-2^ and @xmath17 , as is shown in fig . [",
    "fig2](b ) .",
    "an approximate expression from the perturbation theory for the rt due to phonon leakage towards the contact interface yields @xmath31 , where @xmath32 depends on the phonon density of states and @xmath33 is the average van der waals ( vdw ) coupling constant between the graphene film and its substrate .",
    "a previous calculation @xcite shows that @xmath34 largely depends on the substrate morphology .",
    "the presence of the molecule strongly decreases the film - substrate coupling @xmath34 , thus yielding a longer time @xmath28 .",
    "this demonstrates that the silane molecules constrain the film - substrate phonon scattering , which in turn enhances in - plane heat conduction in the bonded graphene film .",
    "note that za mode becomes `` massive '' as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , i.e. , the za branch does not reach all the way to zero frequency but shifts to higher frequencies .",
    "this might reduce the thermal conductivity , but the effect is weaker than that of the reduced plane - plane scattering , so the in - plane thermal conductivity increases after all",
    ".    for heat transport along short molecules such as silane , the internal vibrational properties of the molecule are crucial @xcite .",
    "to gain a microscopic insight into the thermal transport at the graphene film - substrate interface mediated by the functionalizing molecule , we investigated how the differences in the phonon transmission impact the interfacial phonon transport . to this aim",
    ", we probed the phonon transmission @xmath35 by an atomistic green s function ( agf ) technique@xcite ( supplemental information section ii ) to characterize the local heat conduction with and without the presence of the molecule .",
    "@xmath35 enables a precise measurement of the atomic - scale molecule - graphene heat transport that the conventional models like amm @xcite and dmm @xcite fail to provide . as shown in figure",
    "[ fig4 ] , the transmission function @xmath35 for the two adjacent graphene layers without any molecule displays a clear stepwise structure that follows the number of open phonon channels .",
    "low energy phonons ( @xmath36 mev ) dominate heat conduction since the adjacent graphene flakes interact only through weak vdw forces that inhibit the transmission of high - frequency phonons@xcite .",
    "when the graphene layers are bridged by a silane molecule , the high - frequency phonons act as the major contributors in the heat conductance @xmath37 , creating more phonon channels through the covalent bond vibrations .",
    "this is in line with the transmission calculation of segal _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite who observed a contribution to heat conduction by higher - frequency phonons within the molecule coupled to the low - frequency phonons responsible for heat transport in the thermal reservoirs .",
    "the oscillations in the transmission spectrum may originate from phonon interferences within the alkane chain @xcite .",
    "fabry - prot ( fp ) like interference effects occur in the frequency region of @xmath38 mev , as was previously observed in an alkane sam interface @xcite .",
    "such fp like interferences originate from the multiple reflected phonons interfering constructively within the alkane chain , as the local maxima in the transmission ( figure  [ fig4 ] ) through the molecule can attain the same intensity of that through pristine graphene films at given frequencies .",
    "although destructive quantum interference was believed unlikely to occur in a linear alkane chain @xcite , we observe strong destructive interference patterns in the high frequency range ( @xmath39 thz ) , which may correspond to two - path destructive phonon interferences @xcite .",
    "we investigated the inter - layer electron transport in the graphene and the effect of the silane intercalation in such a hybrid nanostructure through a density - functional - theory calculation combined with green s function ( methods ) .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( c ) and ( d ) , the presence of the molecule reduces the electron transmission by interrupting the @xmath40 stacking of the phenyl rings in the adjacent graphene flakes .",
    "this means that the silane molecule eliminates the electrical current leakage by isolating the graphene heat spreader and the electronic device .",
    "consequently , the main source of the thermal conductance in this system is phonons as the thermal conductance due to the electrons contributes to the total thermal conductance by about @xmath41% ( methods ) .",
    "we have also investigated the in - plane thermal conductivity @xmath2 of the graphene film and its thermal resistance @xmath7 with the functionalized substrate versus the equivalent molecule number density @xmath6 . both @xmath2 and @xmath7 decay with the number density of the molecules @xmath6 . in the limit of small number density @xcite",

    "<S> self - heating is a severe problem for high - power microelectronic devices . </S>",

    "<S> we demonstrate that the temperature of the hotspots can be lowered by  12@xmath0c in transistors operating at  130 w mm@xmath1 , which corresponds to half of an order - of - magnitude increase in the device lifetime . </S>",
