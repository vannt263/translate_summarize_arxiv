    "in the bcs formalism of superconductivity @xcite , an attractive interaction potential is assumed to act between pairs of electrons with opposite momenta and opposite spin projections ( or between pairs of electrons of time reversed eigenstates @xcite ) if their free single - particle energies @xmath12 are in an interval of width @xmath13 centered at @xmath1 . in general",
    "it is assumed that @xmath1 is one and the same as the chemical potential of the system , which will be denoted here by @xmath3 and which is determined by the density of electrons and the interaction of the system with the environment ( e.g. with a heat and particle reservoir ) .",
    "we consider that the pairing potential is a microscopic characteristic of the interaction between the electrons and therefore it is not ( or at least not directly ) determined by the value of the chemical potential , which may be changed by applied pressure or doping .",
    "for this reason , we shall assume that @xmath3 may take values which are different from @xmath1 and we shall investigate the effects of this difference on the superconducting phase .    as expected , when @xmath4 we recover the typical bcs theory .",
    "if @xmath14 the thermodynamics change significantly , namely the gap energy @xmath6 and the temperature of the superconductor - normal metal phase transition decreases with @xmath15 , a quasiparticle branch imbalance appears , and the phase transition becomes discontinuous ( of the first order ) .",
    "for some intervals of @xmath8 , the equation for @xmath6 may have multiple solutions at the same temperature .",
    "for this reason the plot @xmath6 vs @xmath8 at fixed @xmath9 shows multiple branches . in this paper we analyze only the branch of solutions with the biggest gap , which reduce to the bcs solution in the point @xmath16 . for this branch of solutions ,",
    "if @xmath17 ( @xmath11 is the bcs energy gap at zero temperature ) the zero temperature gap is independent of @xmath18 ( although the temperature of the phase transition decreases to zero as @xmath15 increases to @xmath19 ) , whereas for @xmath20 the energy gap is not formed anymore , even at zero temperature . in the standard bcs theory , this phenomenon may be the equivalent of the _ superconducting dome _ from the high-@xmath21 superconductivity .",
    "it is known that quasiparticle imbalance appears when quasiparticle currents are injected into the superconductor sufficiently high above the energy gap .",
    "this is a non - equilibrium situation and is explained in refs .",
    "@xcite by attributing different chemical potentials to the quasiparticle system and to the condensate .",
    "we show here that quasiparticle imbalance appears also in equilibrium , due to the asymmetry with respect to @xmath3 of the interval in which the pairing interaction is manifested and when there is no distinction between the chemical potential of the pairs and the chemical potential of the quasiparticles ( related to this , see the discussion in ref .",

    "the average number of particles in the system is determined by the populations of the quasiparticle states and by the parameters of the model hamiltonian , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath24 .",
    "this more rigorous approach introduces an extra term in the quasiparticle excitation energy , which determines the properties of the system when @xmath5 , but has no effect on the equilibrium properties when @xmath25 and constant density of states , which is the simplified situation discussed in ref .",
