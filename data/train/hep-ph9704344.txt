    "the starting point for this paper is formed by the following observations :    * the only ( known ) systematic method for calculating scattering in qcd is perturbation theory .",
    "( lattice monte - carlo methods work in euclidean space - time , and are excellent for calculating static quantities such as masses from first principles .",
    "but they are essentially useless when a calculation in real minkowski space - time is needed . ) * in field theory , calculations beyond low orders of perturbation theory are computationally complex , both because the calculations of individual graphs are hard and because there are many different graphs . * hence it is important to make the most efficient use of low - order calculations .",
    "since the coupling in practical calculations is not very weak , the accuracy of predictions can be ruined by uncalculated higher - order terms .",
    "it follows that there is a need to estimate the sizes of the errors . for this one",
    "wants quick estimates of terms in perturbation theory .",
    "the computational complexity of the estimates should increase as little as possible with the size of the graphs .",
    "indeed , our aim is that one only calculates integrals of the form @xmath0 with suitable methods :    * one can determine good values for renormalization and factorization scales , by asking how to minimize the error estimates . *",
    "when the estimates get substantially larger than some appropriate `` natural '' size , one would get a diagnosis of a need for resummation of classes of higher - order corrections .",
    "the diagnosis would include an explanation of the large terms and thus indicate the physics associated with the resummation .    in this paper",
    ", we explain how to start such a program .",
    "it builds on work first reported in ref .",
    "our methods treat properties of the integrands of feynman graphs , and are therefore directly sensitive to the physics of the process being discussed .",
    "some other treatments of these issues discuss the problems in terms of the mathematics of series expansions in general , without asking what is causing the graphs to be the sizes they are .",
    "a particular exception is the work of brodsky , lepage , and mackenzie @xcite .",
    "they use heavy quark loops to probe the actual momentum scales that dominate in a particular calculation ; this is then used to provide a suitable value for the renormalization / factorization scale .",
    "but we believe that our methods provide a more direct route to answering the question of why the scales are what they are and why a calculation gives a particular order of magnitude .",
    "the issues addressed by methods involving the borel transform and pad summation address complementary issues @xcite .",
    "now , most cross sections in qcd can not be directly computed by perturbation theory ; this can only be used to compute the short - distance coefficients that appear in the factorization theorem .",
    "so we will also treat the specific problems that arise in estimating the sizes of the coefficient functions .",
    "these functions have the form of a sum over feynman graphs ( typically massless ) , with subtractions to cancel some infra - red ( ir ) divergences .",
    "remaining ir divergences are cancelled between different graphs or between different final - state cuts .",
    "two characteristic features appear .",
    "first , we can obtain estimates for sums of particular sets of graphs , but not for the individual graphs , which are divergent .",
    "secondly , the coefficient functions are not in fact genuine functions .",
    "they are normally singular generalized functions ( or distributions ) and an estimate can only be made for the integral of a coefficient function with a smooth test function .",
    "we show how to estimate the sizes of graphs by a direct examination of the integrands .",
    "an important part of our technique is an implementation of subtractions directly in the integrands , both for the subtractions that implement counterterms for ultra - violet ( uv ) renormalization and for the ir subtractions that are used in short - distance coefficient functions . in order to explain our ideas",
    ", we will examine two examples : ( 1 ) the one - loop self - energy graph in @xmath1 theory , and ( 2 ) a particular set of graphs for the wilson coefficient for deep - inelastic scattering .",
    "our estimates are in the form of approximations to ordinary integrals that are absolutely convergent .",
    "this is in contrast to the original integrals , which are typically divergent in the absence of a regulator .",
    "thus a by - product of our work will be algorithms for computing graphs numerically in minkowski space - time , which may have relevance to work such as ref .  .",
    "as an illustration of how estimations can be carried out , even analytically , for a measurable quantity , we will estimate the size of the wilson coefficient for the structure functions @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the last section .",
    "in this section , we give a representation of the one - loop self - energy graph of fig .",
    "[ fig : self.energy ] in @xmath4 theory in four dimensions .",
    "a particular renormalization scheme is used , which we relate to ordinary renormalization .",
    "then we show how to estimate the size of the graph from elementary integrals and hence how to choose the renormalization scale suitably .    to      the only complication in computing the graph of fig.[fig : self.energy ] is its uv divergence , given that we choose to work in euclidean space . we give a representation of the graph that is an absolutely convergent integral over the loop momentum itself in four dimensions and",
    "in which the renormalization is explicitly `` minimal '' .",
    "this last term means that the counterterm for the ( logarithmic ) divergence is independent of the mass and the external momentum .",
    "it is a very useful property when one wants to take zero - mass limits , etc . for a general divergence",
    ", the counterterm would be polynomial in masses and external momenta .",
    "our representation of the graph is : @xmath5 }              - \\frac { \\theta ( k>\\mu _ { c})}{k^{4 } }            \\right\\ } .",
    "\\label{ren.self.energy}\\ ] ] we recognize in the integrand a term that is given by the usual feynman rules ( in euclidean space - time ) , and a subtraction term .",
    "the subtraction term is the negative of the asymptote of the first term as @xmath6 , so we term our procedure `` renormalization by subtraction of the asymptote '' .",
    "a cut - off is applied to prevent the subtraction term giving an ir divergence at @xmath7 ; the cut - off does not affect the @xmath6 behavior and therefore does not affect the fact that the uv divergence is cancelled . to see that eq .",
    "( [ ren.self.energy ] ) is equivalent to standard renormalization , one simply applies a uv regulator , after which each term can be integrated separately .",
    "the first term is the unrenormalized graph and the second term is a @xmath8-independent counterterm .",
    "evidently , the integral is absolutely convergent , and can therefore be computed by any appropriate numerical method .",
    "( it can also be evaluated analytically . but this is not interesting to us , since we wish to obtain methods that work for integrals that are too complicated for purely analytic methods to be convenient or useful . )",
    "the counterterm is in fact the most general one that is independent of @xmath9 and @xmath8 , since any other renormalization counterterm can differ only by a finite term added to the integral that is independent of @xmath9 and @xmath8 , and a change of the cut - off @xmath10 is equivalent to adding such a term .",
    "we can relate the counterterm to the commonly used one simply by computing the counterterm alone , with dimensional regularization : @xmath11 the result is that setting @xmath10 equal to the scale @xmath12 of the scheme gives exactly renormalization .",
    "in general , we would find that @xmath10 would be a factor times @xmath12 , or equivalently that we should set @xmath13 and then add a specific finite counterterm to the graph .",
    "notice that the integral to relate our renormalization scheme to the scheme is algorithmically simpler to compute analytically than the original integral .",
    "there is always the possibility of adding finite counterterms .",
    "moreover , the precise form of the cut - off is irrelevant to the general principles .",
    "one can , for example , change the sharp cut - off function @xmath14 to a smooth function @xmath15 that obeys @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "such a function would probably be better in numerical integration .",
    "of course , our method as stated is specific to one - loop graphs .",
    "but it is an idea that has been generalized @xcite to higher orders .",
    "we now show how to estimate the size of the integral eq.([ren.self.energy ] ) . to give ourselves a definite case ,",
    "let us choose @xmath18 .",
    "we obtain the estimate as the sum of contributions from @xmath19 and from @xmath20 .",
    "since the renormalization counterterm is designed to subtract the @xmath6 behavior of the unrenormalized integrand , we regard it as a @xmath21-function at infinity and therefore to be associated completely with the @xmath20 term in our estimate .    in the region @xmath19 ,",
    "our estimate is obtained by replacing each propagator by @xmath22 so that @xmath23 this factor is the product of @xmath24 for the prefactor and @xmath25 for the volume of a unit 4-sphere . as advertised , we have had to calculate no integral that is more complicated than a simple power of @xmath26 .",
    "the approximation of replacing the propagators by @xmath22 leads us to an over - estimate of the integral , but not by a great factor , since we are in a region of small momentum .",
    "the estimate for @xmath20 is obtained by replacing the propagators by their large @xmath26 asymptote : @xmath27 \\nonumber\\\\    & = & \\frac { g^{2}}{32\\pi ^{4 } } 2\\pi ^{2 }    \\left [       \\int _ { m}^{\\infty } \\frac { dk}{k } - \\int _",
    "{ \\mu } ^{\\infty } \\frac { dk}{k }    \\right ] .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since we are taking the difference of two terms , we must be careful about the errors , which are of order @xmath28    to understand the structure of the result , let us examine how the original integral ( [ ren.self.energy ] ) appears after integrating over the angle of @xmath26 : @xmath29 .",
    "\\label{log.integral}\\ ] ] the function @xmath30 is the angular average of @xmath31 times the two propagators .",
    "it approaches 0 as @xmath32 , so that the integral is convergent there , and it approaches unity as @xmath6 , which would give a uv divergence were it not for the subtraction .",
    "to    we can represent this situation by the graphs of fig.[fig : difference ] .",
    "the transition region for the unsubtracted integrand , where it changes from being 0 to 1 , is around @xmath33 , to within a factor of 2 or so ; this is evident by examining the denominators . by setting @xmath10 to be @xmath9 to within a factor of 2 ,",
    "we achieve the following :    * the integrand is less than unity everywhere .",
    "* it is concentrated in a shell of thickness of order @xmath9 around @xmath33 .",
    "thus we can say that the natural size of the graph is the product of    * the prefactor @xmath24 .",
    "* the surface area of a unit 4-sphere : @xmath34 . * the width of the important region , about unity , in units of @xmath9 . * a factor of @xmath9 to the dimension of the integral , i.e. , 1 . *",
    "a factor less than unity , say @xmath35 , to allow for the fact that , after subtraction , the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ log.integral ] ) is smaller than unity and that there is a cancellation between negative and positive pieces .",
    "that is , the natural size is @xmath36 , if @xmath12 is reasonably close to @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath12 is not close to @xmath9 , then we get a long plateau in the integrand ",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : difference ] .",
    "the height of the plateau is unity , and its length is @xmath37 to about @xmath38 in units of @xmath39 .",
    "this clearly gives a larger - than - necessary size , and an optimal choice of the scale is around @xmath9 .",
    "one should not expect to get an exact value for the scale @xmath12 .",
    "a physical quantity in the exact theory is independent of @xmath12 , and any finite - order calculation differs from the correct value by an amount whose precise value is necessarily unknown until one has done a more accurate calculation .",
    "if one is able to estimate the size of the error , as we are proposing , then an appropriate value of @xmath12 is one that minimizes the error . given the intrinsic imprecision of an error estimate , there is a corresponding imprecision in the determination of @xmath12 .",
    "one can expect to identify , without much work , an appropriate scale @xmath12 to within a factor 2 , and , with a bit more work , to within perhaps @xmath40 .",
    "these estimates just come from asking where the transition region in the integrand is , and by then obtaining an answer by simple examination of the integrand .",
    "but one can not enter into a religious argument of the wrong kind as to whether the correct scale is @xmath41 as opposed to @xmath42 , for example . by definition",
    "an error estimate is approximate .",
    "since we have not yet investigated how to estimate even higher - order graphs , we are making the reasonable conjecture that the properties of graphs do not change rapidly with order .",
    "then our estimate that @xmath12 should be close to @xmath9 will ensure that higher - order graphs are of the order of their natural size .",
    "the same arguments applied to similar graphs in qcd show that the natural expansion parameter in qcd is @xmath43 these arguments rely on being able to show that in the dominant part of the range of integration all lines have approximately a particular virtuality and that the relevant range of integration is a corresponding volume of momentum space .    in the general case",
    "we can not expect to get a much smaller result , but we can expect that in some situations the properties of the dominant integration region(s ) will not be so good .",
    "so what we need to do next is to analyze more interesting graphs in qcd .",
    "this we will do in the next section .",
    "in general , when we get corrections in qcd that are substantially larger than the natural size given above , it must be either because the integrand is excessively large , or because there is no single natural scale , or because we have not chosen a good scale .",
    "if the integrand is especially large relative to the natural unit , or if there is no single natural scale , then we should investigate in more detail the reasons , and derive something like a resummation of higher - order corrections @xcite . in precisely such situations , one does indeed have to compute high - order graphs . at the same time",
    ", there is no need to compute the complete graphs in all their gory detail , but only their simple parts .",
    "the factorization formula for the leading - twist part of a deep - inelastic structure function @xmath44 is @xmath45 here , @xmath46 is a parton density , and @xmath47 is the short - distance coefficient ( `` wilson coefficient '' ) . we have suppressed the indices for the different structure functions ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 , etc . ) and for the parton flavor .",
    "the coefficient function @xmath50 is obtained from feynman graphs for scattering on a parton target with momentum @xmath51 , where @xmath8 is the momentum of the hadron target .",
    "subtractions for initial - state collinear singularities are applied to the wilson coefficient and the massless limit is taken .    to    as an example , we will examine the contribution to the wilson coefficient from the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig:1-loop.dis ] .",
    "these diagrams are the two possible cuts of a particular uncut one - loop graph , and since we will need to use a cancellation of final - state interactions , we must consider the sum of the two cut graphs as a single unit .",
    "note :    * we will apply a subtraction to cancel the effect of initial - state collinear interactions where the incoming quark splits into a quark ",
    "gluon pair which are moving almost parallel to the incoming particle .. ] * there will be soft - gluon interactions and collinear final - state interactions .",
    "these will cancel after the sum over cuts .",
    "( in a more general situation , a sum over a gauge - invariant set of graphs is necessary to get rid of all soft - gluon interactions . ) * the wilson coefficient is a distribution ( or generalized function ) rather than an ordinary function of @xmath52 .",
    "thus it is useful to discuss only the size of the coefficient after it is integrated with a test function , but not the size of the unintegrated coefficient function .",
    "the parton density @xmath46 provides a ready - made test function that has a physical interpretation .",
    "* the first graph of fig .",
    "[ fig:1-loop.dis ] , which has a virtual gluon , has a 4-dimensional integral , but the second graph , with a real gluon , has only a 3-dimensional integral .",
    "thus the cancellations associated with the sum over cuts can only be seen after doing at least a 1-dimensional integral .    to    it is useful to visualize the process in space - time , fig.[fig : sp - time ] , and to use light - front coordinates @xmath53 ( defined by @xmath54 ) .",
    "our axes are such that the incoming momenta for the hard scattering are : @xmath55 also , we find it convenient to parameterize the gluon momentum in fig.[fig:1-loop.dis ] in terms of two longitudinal momentum fractions , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , and a transverse momentum @xmath58 , as follows : @xmath59 thus @xmath57 is exactly the fraction of the total incoming minus component of momentum that is carried off by the gluon , while @xmath56 is a scaled fraction of the plus component .",
    "the scaling is somewhat unobvious , but it has the effect that positive energy constraints on the final state restrict each of @xmath56 and @xmath57 to range over the 0 to 1 .",
    "now we summarize how the calculation of the real and virtual graphs and of the subtraction graphs @xcite , contributing to the wilson coefficients , is to be carried out :    * using the feynman rules for cut diagrams , we write down the momentum integral with the appropriate @xmath21-functions . then we contract the trace over dirac matrices with the appropriate transverse , longitudinal or asymmetric tensor on the photon indices to obtain the structure function @xmath48 , @xmath49 , etc . for the sake of a definite simple example we choose to contract with @xmath60 , which in fact gives the combination @xmath61 .",
    "* we express the results of the calculations in terms of the light - cone components of @xmath26 ( the internal gluon momentum ) , of @xmath8 ( the incoming quark momentum ) , and of @xmath62 ( the incoming photon momentum ) .",
    "* in the graphs with real gluon emission , we use the two @xmath21-functions to perform the integrals over @xmath58 and over the fractional momentum @xmath63 entering from the parton density .",
    "this leaves a 2-dimensional integral . * in the virtual graphs , we use the one @xmath21-function to perform the integral fractional momentum @xmath63 entering from the parton density .",
    "we then perform the @xmath58 integral analytically .",

    "( [ wilson.1 ] ) is the sum of contributions from the following regions :    * @xmath107 : the value of the integrand is about @xmath108 times a function of @xmath57 . for good choices of @xmath69 , the function of @xmath57 is less than about unity , but with an indefinite sign .",
    "thus we obtain a contribution of about @xmath81 in size . * @xmath109 : the integrand is now approximately @xmath110 , again times a mild function of @xmath57 .",
    "we therefore obtain a contribution of about @xmath111 .",
    "* exterior of unit square : here , the only contribution is from the virtual graph , and we have no final - state singularity .",
    "hence the naive estimate of unity is valid .",
    "( the precise value , when @xmath112 , is in fact somewhat larger . )    all of these are to be multiplied by the pre - factor @xmath113 .",
    "so we obtain a total contribution of @xmath114 , \\label{estimate.vertex}\\ ] ] where each term represents an estimate , valid up to a factor of 2 or so .",
    "the contributions from within the unit square may have either sign , depending on the cut in the collinear subtraction , while the contributions from outside the unit square , from virtual graphs only , have a negative sign . as an explicit indication that our estimates are valid for the sizes but not the signs of the graphs , we have inserted a @xmath115 sign in front of each term .",
    "this estimate assumes that renormalization of the uv divergence of the virtual graph is done at the natural scale @xmath116 , and that renormalization of the parton densities is done so that it corresponds to @xmath69 of about 1/2 .",
    "it also assumes that @xmath81 falls steeply enough for @xmath103 to be less than about 1 , as is typically true .",
    "it is obvious that there is a logarithmic enhancement in eq.([estimate.vertex ] ) whenever @xmath103 is small .",
    "our calculation is , of course , no more than a rederivation of the standard observation that there are large logarithms in the @xmath100 region .",
    "what our derivation adds is to show that it is not so much the limit @xmath100 that is causing the problem as the steepness of the parton densities .",
    "moreover we have given a numerical criterion for when the correction begins to be larger than what we called the natural size for higher - order corrections .",
    "in other words we have shown how to estimate the constant term that accompanies the logarithm .",
    "moreover this is all presented in the context of a general method for obtaining estimates of the sizes of graphs .",
    "it is perhaps clear that , with sufficient foresight , one could have predicted the large corrections merely from the observation that the derivation of the factorization theorem requires the cancellation of final - state divergences between different final states .",
    "there is in fact another source of large corrections that will make its effect felt in even higher order .",
    "this is a mismatch in the scales needed for renormalizing the parton densities .",
    "we have renormalized these by using a value of @xmath69 that must be about 1/2 to avoid making the contribution of the graph unnecessarily large . in the case of the real graph",
    ", we can translate this to a scale of transverse momentum by using the mass - shell condition for the gluon : @xmath117 evidently , whenever small values of @xmath56 are important , small values of @xmath118 ( relative to @xmath119 ) will be important .",
    "this does not affect our one - loop calculation .",
    "but in higher - order correction , the virtuality of some internal lines will be controlled by the value of @xmath118 , and hence there will be mismatches between the scales needed at different steps in the calculation .",
    "once one has diagnosed the problem , we see that a proper solution lies in more accurately calculating the form of the wilson coefficient near its singularity .",
    "this subject goes under the heading of resummation of large corrections @xcite .",
    "in the following we will estimate the sizes of the one - loop corrections to the structure functions @xmath2 and @xmath3 _ without _ doing actual calculations of feynman diagrams by giving a recipe of how to construct the estimates from general principles and kinematic considerations .",
    "however , we will present the recipe in the context of an actual set of feynman graphs . by using the calculations of the graphs in the appendix",
    ", we will verify that these `` simple - minded '' estimates are actually valid .",
    "one obtains @xmath120 from the well - known hadronic tensor @xmath121 by projecting out the `` transverse '' and `` longitudinal '' pieces via : @xmath122 which give , for example , @xmath123w^{\\mu \\nu } .\\ ] ]      the recipe for estimating @xmath3 is the following :    * the singularities we encounter ( uv , collinear and soft ) are all in the form of a factor times the born graph , and the born graph has no longitudinal part . therefore the one - loop graphs for @xmath3 have no uv , soft or collinear singularities .",
    "* since the parton densities are falling with increasing @xmath82 , the size of a graph is : @xmath124 * the range of @xmath57 is 1 . *",
    "the range of @xmath56 is @xmath103 .",
    "it is elementary to show that the self - energy and vertex graphs ( whether real or virtual ) give a zero contribution to @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , our result for @xmath3 is : @xmath125    let us now check whether our intuition has guided us in the right way .",
    "we use eq .",
    "( [ fl.ladder ] ) for the contribution to the coefficient function for @xmath3 .",
    "we approximate the @xmath56 integral by @xmath126 which is appropriate for a typical parton density , which falls with increasing @xmath82 .",
    "the @xmath57 integral gives a factor @xmath35 , and we recover eq .",
    "( [ fl.estimate ] ) , which we obtained by more general arguments .",
    "notice that @xmath3 is generally rather smaller than what we have termed the natural size , because of the @xmath103 factor : i.e. , because of the restricted phase space available .",
    "there are no enhancements due to final - state singularities .",
    "our estimation methods can be applied in two ways .",
    "one is to estimate the graphs without having explicit expressions for the graphs ; one just searches for the possible singularities that would prevent the natural size of a graph from being its actual size .",
    "the second way of using the methods is to examine the expressions for graphs with the knowledge of the singularity and subtraction structure and to perform a more direct estimate of the sizes .",
    "this is useful since the integrals must often be performed numerically , e.g. , whenever one convolutes with parton densities that are only known numerically .",
    "additional information that is now obtained concerns the typical virtualities , etc .",
    ", of the internal lines of the graphs ( compare neubert s work @xcite ) .",
    "this enables a diagnosis to be made of the extent to which a problem is a multi - scale problem and therefore in need of resummation .",
    "a point that we have not addressed is the estimation of the size of the trace of a string of gamma matrices , for example . in the standard formula for such a trace involves a large number of terms .",
    "nevertheless , it is evident from the above calculations that there are cancellations .",
    "the final result is that we obtain , relative to corresponding numbers for a scalar field theory , a small factor ( 1 to 4 ) times a standard lorentz - invariant quantity for the process .",
    "evidently , more work on this subject is needed .",
    "but the issue of the size of the numerator factors from traces , etc . , affects completely finite quantities , such as the one - loop coefficient function for @xmath3 , just as much as quantities with divergences that are cancelled .",
    "however , it is the latter quantities that have the potential for especially large corrections .",
    "numerator factors result in magnitudes common to all graphs .",
    "we have already calculated one graph , fig .",
    "[ fig:1-loop.dis ] , for @xmath2 , so we only need to summarize the method and apply it to the remaining graphs . the general procedure is :    * since we have singularities in our graphs , they have to be cancelled . in wilson coefficients",
    "such as we are calculating , there are explicit subtractions for the collinear initial - state singularities .",
    "then there are explicit subtractions for uv divergences ( both those associated with the interactions and those needed to define the parton densities and that therefore enter into the initial - state subtractions ) .",
    "finally there are final - state singularities that cancel between real and virtual graphs . *",
    "we consider separately the integrations inside and outside the square @xmath127 .",
    "* a term of the order of the natural size arises from outside the square @xmath128 .",
    "this comes from purely virtual graphs , with their collinear subtraction . * inside the square , a real graph without a final - state singularity contributes an amount of the order of the natural size times @xmath103 .",
    "this reflects the restriction on the range of integration imposed by the parton density . *",
    "similarly a virtual graph without a final - state singularity contributes a term of the natural size . *",
    "finally , the sum of real and virtual graphs with a final - state singularity contributes a term of the order of the natural size enhanced by a factor @xmath129 , just as in our estimate of fig .",
    "[ fig:1-loop.dis ] .",
    "we have the graphs of fig .",
    "[ fig:1-loop.dis ] , their hermitian conjugates , the cut and uncut self - energy graph of fig.[fig : qself.energy ] , below , and the ladder graph , fig.[fig : remaining.graph ] . since @xmath130 typically , the ladder graph gives a small contribution , and it is sufficient to multiply the estimate of the fig .",

    "( [ ft.se ] ) .",
    "we found it convenient to use @xmath57 and @xmath118 as integration variables .",
    "there is a singularity at @xmath132 in each individual graph . in analogy to the definition of @xmath103 , eq .",
    "( [ div.u ] ) , we define @xmath133 and by following the same steps as we applied to the ladder graph , we find the following estimate for the contribution of fig .  [",
    "fig : qself.energy ] : @xmath134 . \\label{se.estimate}\\ ] ] we have inserted a @xmath135 sign in this estimate ; it is fairly easy to see that the coefficient of the logarithm is negative .    for the ladder graph ,",
    "whose contribution to @xmath2 is in eq.([ft.ladder ] ) , there is only an initial - state singularity and that is cancelled by an explicit subtraction .",
    "if @xmath69 is around @xmath35 , then we can apply the same reasoning as for the longitudinal part of the ladder graph , and we find an estimate @xmath136 where , as in eq .",
    "( [ estimate.vertex ] ) , we use the @xmath115 to indicate that our estimates do not determine the sign of the contribution .",
    "we have already examined the cut and uncut vertex graphs , in eq .",
    "( [ estimate.vertex ] ) . when we multiply this by 2 ( to allow for the hermitian conjugate graphs ) and add the self - energy and ladder contributions , eqs .",
    "( [ se.estimate ] ) and ( [ ladder.t.estimate ] ) , we get somewhat less than our original estimate , eq .",
    "( [ eq.est ] ) , provided the renormalization mass @xmath12 is in a reasonable range .",
    "this lower value is because the self - energy graph is simpler than the vertex graph .",
    "* we have a systematic method for estimating the sizes of higher - order graphs . *",
    "the natural expansion parameter in qcd is of the order of @xmath137 in answer to a question asked when this work was presented at a conference , let us observe : _ the above number may not be the actual expansion parameter , but we argue that this natural size sets a measure of whether actual higher - order corrections are of a normal size or are especially large . _ * the method allows an identification of appropriate sizes for renormalization and factorization scales .",
    "* by an examination of the kinematics of graphs , we can identify contributions that are large compared with the estimates based merely on the size of the natural expansion parameter .",
    "* our method should give a systematic technique of diagnosing the reasons for the large corrections , and hence of indicating where one should work out resummation methods . *",
    "the method gives an algorithm for the numerical integration of graphs , both real and virtual .",
    "this is clearly just the start of a project , and there is also a lot of overlap with work such as that of catani and seymour @xcite , of brodsky and lu @xcite , and of neubert @xcite .",
