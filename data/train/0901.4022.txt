    "bundles of fibers , with statistical distributed thresholds for the breakdown of individual fibers , present interesting models of failures in materials .",
    "they have simple geometry and clear - cut rules for how stress caused by a failed element is redistributed on undamaged fibers . since these models can be analyzed to an extent that is not possible for more complex materials , they have been much studied ( for reviews , see @xcite ) .",
    "the statistical distribution of the _ size _ of avalanches in fiber bundles is well studied @xcite , and the failure dynamics under constant load has been formulated @xcite through recursion relations which in turn explore the phase transitions and associated critical behavior in these models .    in this article",
    "we present a way to predict when an over - loaded bundle collapses , by monitoring the fiber breaking rate .",
    "we focus on the equal - load - sharing models , in which the load previously carried by a failed fiber is shared equally by all the remaining intact fibers @xcite .",
    "we consider a bundle consisting of a large number @xmath0 of elastic fibers , clamped at both ends ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the fibers obey hooke s law with force constant set to unity for simplicity .",
    "each fiber @xmath1 is associated with a breakdown threshold @xmath2 for its elongation .",
    "when the length exceeds @xmath2 the fiber breaks immediately , and does not contribute to the strength of the bundle thereafter .",
    "the individual thresholds @xmath2 are assumed to be independent random variables with the same cumulative distribution function @xmath3 and a corresponding density function @xmath4 : @xmath5        fig .  1 . the fiber bundle model .",
    "+    if an external load @xmath6 is applied to a fiber bundle , the resulting failure events can be seen as a sequential process @xcite . in the first step all fibers that can not withstand the applied load break . then the stress is redistributed on the surviving fibers , which compels further fibers to fail , etc .",
    "this iterative process continues until all fibers fail , or an equilibrium situation with a nonzero bundle strength is reached . since the number of fibers is finite , the number of steps , @xmath7 , in this sequential process is _",
    "finite_.    at a force ( or elongation )",
    "@xmath8 per surviving fiber the total force on the bundle is @xmath8 times the number of _ intact _ fibers .",
    "the expected or average force at this stage is therefore @xmath9 the maximum @xmath10 of @xmath11 corresponds to the value @xmath12 for which @xmath13 vanishes .",
    "thus @xmath14 we characterize the state of the bundle as _ pre - critical _ or _ post - critical _ depending upon the stress value @xmath15 relative to the critical stress @xmath16 we study the stepwise failure process in the bundle , when a fixed external load @xmath17 is applied .",

    "simulations show that the breaking rate has a minimum at some value @xmath33 , and that for varying @xmath34 the minima all occur at a value close to @xmath35 when plotted as function of the scaled variable @xmath36 ( fig .  2 ) .",
