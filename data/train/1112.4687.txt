    "this is the third of a series of papers ( together with @xcite and @xcite ) proposing an extension of the one dimensional renormalization theory for the case of quasi - periodically forced one dimensional maps .",
    "these three papers are closely related but each of them has been written to be readable independently .",
    "see also @xcite for a more detailed discussion . in the previous two papers",
    "we were concerned with the theoretical part of the theory . in this paper",
    "we include different numerical computations which support the conjectures introduced for the developing of this theory .",
    "to do that we briefly review the theory developed in the previous two papers , skipping technical details and we adding some numerical computations to the discussion .",
    "the universality and self - renormalization properties in the cascade of period doubling bifurcations of families of unimodal maps is a well known phenomenon .",
    "the paradigmatic example is the logistic map @xmath0 .",
    "given a typical one parametric family of unimodal maps @xmath1 one observes numerically that there exists a sequence of parameter values @xmath2 such that the attracting periodic orbit of the map undergoes a period doubling bifurcation .",
    "between one period doubling and the next one there exists also a parameter value @xmath3 , for which the critical point of @xmath4 is a periodic orbit with period @xmath5 .",
    "one can observe numerically that @xmath6 this convergence indicates a self - similarity on the parameter space of the family .",
    "on the other hand , the constant @xmath7 is universal , in the sense that for any family of unimodal maps with a quadratic turning point having a cascade of period doubling bifurcations , one obtains the same ratio @xmath7 .    to explain these phenomena collet and treser ( @xcite ) and feigenbaum ( @xcite )",
    "proposed simultaneously the renormalization operator .",
    "their explanation was based on the existence of a hyperbolic fixed point of the operator with suitable properties .",
    "the first proof of the existence of this point and its hyperbolicity were obtained with numerical assistance @xcite .",
    "a decade later , sullivan ( see @xcite ) generalized the operator and provided a theoretical proof of the hyperbolicity using complex dynamics techniques .",
    "see @xcite for extensive summaries on the theory .",
    "in @xcite we presented numerical evidences of self similarity and universality for families of quasi - periodically forced logistic maps .",
    "these are maps in the cylinder where the dynamics on the periodic variable are given by a rigid rotation and the dynamics on the other variable are given by the logistic map plus a small perturbation which depends on both variables .",
    "this kind of maps have its origins in studies related to the existence of strange non - chaotic attractors ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let us describe these numerical evidences with more detail .",
    "consider @xmath8 a two parametric family of quasi - periodic maps in the cylinder @xmath9 of the form @xmath10 with @xmath11 a diophantine number , @xmath12 and @xmath13 parameters and @xmath14 a periodic function with respect to @xmath15 which can also depend on @xmath12 and @xmath13 . recall that the logistic map @xmath16 has a complete cascade of period doubling bifurcations .",
    "as before , let @xmath2 denote the parameter values where the attracting periodic orbit undergoes a period doubling bifurcation and @xmath17 the values for which the critical point of @xmath4 is a periodic orbit with period @xmath5 .",
    "in @xcite we computed some bifurcation diagrams in terms of the dynamics of the attracting set .",
    "we have taken into account different properties of the attracting set , as the lyapunov exponent and , in the case of having a periodic invariant curve , its period and its reducibility .",
    "the reducibility loss of an invariant curve is not a bifurcation in the classical sense that the attracting set of the map changes dramatically , only the spectral properties of the transfer operator associated to the continuation of that curve does ( see @xcite ) . despite of this",
    ", it can be characterized as a bifurcation ( see definition 2.3 in @xcite ) .",
    "the numerical computations in @xcite reveal that the parameter values for which the invariant curve doubles its period are contained in regions of the parameter space where the invariant curve is reducible .",
    "these computations also reveal that from every parameter value @xmath18 two curves of reducibility loss ( of the @xmath5-periodic invariant curve ) are born .",
    "this situation is sketched in the left panel of figure [ esquema bifpar ] .",
    "assume that these two curves can be locally expressed as @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "in @xcite we proved that these curves really exist under suitable hypothesis .",
    "we have also given explicit expressions of the slopes @xmath21 and @xmath22 in terms of the quasi - periodic renormalization operator ( introduced there ) .",
    "we only focus on @xmath21 , but the discussion for @xmath22 is completely analogous .    the slopes @xmath21 can be used for the numerical detection of universality and self - renormalization phenomena . if the bifurcation diagram is self - similar by an affine ratio one should have that @xmath23 converges to a constant . in @xcite",
    "we compute numerically this ratios and we show that this is not true due to the fact that when the period is doubled , the rotation number of the system also is .",
    "what we find is that there exists an affine relationship between the bifurcation diagram of the family for rotation number @xmath11 and the bifurcation diagram of the same family for rotation number @xmath24 .",
    "this is sketched in figure [ esquema bifpar ] .",
    "concretely , in @xcite we observed numerically the following behavior .",
    "* * first numerical observation : * the sequence @xmath23 is not convergent in @xmath25 .",
    "but , for @xmath11 fix , one obtains the same sequence for any family of quasi - periodic forced map like ( [ q.p- family ] ) , with a quasi - periodic forcing of the type @xmath26 . * * second numerical observation : * the sequence @xmath27 associated to maps like ( [ q.p- family ] ) is convergent in @xmath25 when we take the quasi - periodic forcing of the type @xmath28 .",
    "the limit depends on @xmath11 and @xmath29 . * * third numerical observation : * the two previous observations are not true when the quasi - periodic forcing is of the type @xmath30 when @xmath31 .",
    "but the sequence @xmath27 associated to the map ( [ q.p- family ] ) with @xmath32 is @xmath33-close to the same maps with @xmath34    in @xcite we extended the renormalization operator and we obtained explicit expressions of the slopes @xmath21 and @xmath22 in terms of the quasi - periodic renormalization operator .",
    "this is reviewed in section [ section review q - p renor ] .",
    "in @xcite we give a theoretical explanation to the numerical observations described above in terms of the dynamics of the quasi - periodic renormalization operator .",
    "this is reviewed in section [ section a not yet rigorous explanation ] .",
    "the novelty in this paper is that we present numerical support to the conjectures done in @xcite .",
    "this numerical support is presented after the statement of each of the conjectures , with the exception of conjecture * [ conjecture h2 ] * , which is given in section [ section applicability flm ] . in appendix [ section numerical computation of the specturm of l_omega ]",
    "we describe the numerical approximation used to discretize the renormalization operator and how we use it to compute the spectrum of its derivative .",

    "it is only necessary that @xmath37 , but we restrict this study to the analytic case due to technical reasons . along section [ section definition and basic properties ]",
    "it is not necessary to require @xmath11 diophantine , but it will be necessary in section [ chapter application ] .",
    "the definition of the operator is done in a perturbative way , in the sense that it is only applicable to maps @xmath38 with @xmath39 renormalizable in the one dimensional sense and @xmath14 small .",

    "we focussed the discussion on the asymptotic behavior for families satisfying hypothesis * h2*. the map considered in the third numerical observation of section [ subsection intro numerical evidences ] is an example of a map not satisfying * h2 * for which equations ( [ equation thm proof universality conjecture ] ) and ( [ equation coro univ implies renor ] ) do not hold .",
    "let @xmath447 be a two parametric family of maps satisfying hypothesis * h1 * , * h2 * and * h3*. let @xmath425 denote slope of the reducibility loss bifurcation associated to the @xmath5 periodic invariant curve of the family . finally consider @xmath280 a diophantine rotation number for the family .",
    "let @xmath281 be the parameter value for which @xmath282 intersects @xmath448 .",
    "the main difference between the example considered in the third numerical observation of section [ subsection intro numerical evidences ] and the previous two is that @xmath449 where the spaces @xmath450 are given by ( [ equation spaces bbk ] ) . more concretely , for the numerical example cited above we have considered @xmath451 as this family depends on @xmath33 , we denote by @xmath452 this concrete family .",
    "the parameter @xmath33 is considered in addition to the parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 of the family .",
    "in other words , for each @xmath453 , @xmath452 is a two parametric family of maps .",
    "then one has that equation ( [ equation theorem reduction to dynamics of renormalization ] ) still holds with @xmath454 , with @xmath455 and @xmath456 the sequence given by ( [ equation sequences directions counterexample 0 ] ) and @xmath429 and @xmath430 given by ( [ eq : initial vectors ] ) . in this case",
    "there is no universal behavior because the sequence @xmath318 lives in a bigger invariant space , where the renormalization operator is not contractive . on the other hand ,",
    "the numerical computations in @xcite suggest that the sequence @xmath457 ( for @xmath458 ) is not asymptotically equivalent to @xmath459 , but both sequences are @xmath33-close to each other .",
    "this can be explained as a consequence conjecture * [ conjecture h5 ] * where we conjecture uniform growth ( in norm ) of the sequences @xmath455 and @xmath456 . for more details",
    "see theorem 3.20 in @xcite .",
    "the theory exposed in sections [ section review q - p renor ] and [ section a not yet rigorous explanation ] have been built as a response to the observations done in the study of the forced logistic map ( see @xcite ) . in this section",
    "we discuss the applicability of the quasi - periodic renormalization theory to the forced logistic map . in the cited papers we considered two different version of the flm , which correspond to the map ( [ q.p- family ] ) with either @xmath460 or @xmath461 , where the parameters @xmath462 \\times [ 0,1]$ ] .",
    "notice that these two forms of the flm do not satisfy the requirements of the theory developed in the previous sections because the family of maps does not belong to @xmath53 .",
    "this problem can be easily solved as follows .",
    "for @xmath463 we can consider the affine change of variables given by @xmath464 , with @xmath465 and @xmath466 . if we apply this change of variables to the family ( [ q.p- family ] ) when @xmath460 we obtain the following family , @xmath467    if we apply the same change of variables",
    "when @xmath468 we obtain this other family @xmath469    although the change of variables considered depends on the parameter @xmath12 , the parameter space of the maps ( [ flm new set up ] ) and ( [ flm b new set up ] ) is the same as the parameter space of the map ( [ q.p- family ] ) ( for the corresponding value of @xmath14 ) .",
    "then any conclusion drawn on the parameter space of the map ( [ flm new set up ] ) ( respectively ( [ flm b new set up ] ) ) extends automatically to the parameter space of ( [ q.p- family ] ) .",
    "with this new set up , we have that both families of maps belong to @xmath53 for @xmath470 and @xmath13 small enough .",
    "one should check that the flm satisfies hypotheses * h1 * and * h2*. to check * h1 * one should check that the one dimensional logistic map intersects transversally @xmath448 the stable manifold of the renormalization operator .",
    "this is an implicit assumption when one uses the renormalization operator to explain the universality observed for the logistic map .",
    "the only proof ( to our knowledge ) of this fact is the one given by lyubich ( theorem 4.11 of @xcite ) .",
    "this proof is done in the space of quadratic - like germs , which is a smaller space than the one considered here .",
    "hypothesis * h2 * is trivial to check for the maps ( [ flm new set up ] ) and ( [ flm b new set up ] ) ) .",
    "on the other hand , note that theorem 3.8 in @xcite not only gives the existence of reducibility loss bifurcations , but it also gives an explicit expression of its slopes in term of the renormalization operator ( the ones given by formulas ( [ equation alpha",
    "n + ] ) and ( [ equation alpha n - ] ) ) .",
    "actually we have given even a more explicit formula in corollary 3.13 in @xcite .",
    "we used these formulas to compute the reducibility directions @xmath21 of the forced logistic map ( [ flm new set up ] ) .",
    "the initial values @xmath179 have been computed numerically , by means of a newton method applied to their invariance equation .",
    "differentiating on formula ( [ flm new set up ] ) ( respectively ( [ flm b new set up ] ) ) it is easy to write the values of @xmath471 and @xmath472 in terms of @xmath179 . then using the discretization of the operator done in appendix [ section numerical computation of the specturm of l_omega ] , we can compute numerically the iterates @xmath473 and @xmath474 , for @xmath475 .",
    "once we have these functions , we can evaluate them to compute the values of @xmath476 given by formula ( @xmath477 ) of @xcite .",
    "we have used this procedure to compute the values of @xmath478 for the map ( [ flm new set up ] ) ( consequently also for the map ( [ q.p- family ] ) with @xmath479 ) and @xmath480 .",
    "the results are shown in table [ taula difdirmin ] .",
    "the values @xmath481 have been also computed in @xcite via a completely different procedure , based on a continuation method with extended precision .",
    "more concretely these values are displayed in table @xmath198 of the cited paper .",
    "the third and fourth columns of table [ taula difdirmin ] display the discrepancies between both computation , in absolute ( @xmath482 ) and relative ( @xmath483 ) terms .",
    "this experiment has been repeated for other values of @xmath11 and also for the map ( [ flm b new set up ] ) . in all cases we obtained that the slopes computed with both methods are the same up to similar accuracies to the ones displayed in table [ taula difdirmin ] .",
    "this supports the correctness of both computations and at the same time the conjecture * [ conjecture h2 ] * , which has been assumed to be true to derive the formula used for this estimation .",
    "in this appendix we present the numerical method that we used to discretize @xmath136 and to study its spectrum numerically .",
    "our method is a slight modification of the one introduced by lanford in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath484 be the complex disc centered on @xmath485 with radius @xmath385 .",
    "consider @xmath486 the space of real analytic functions such that they are holomorphic on @xmath484 and continuous on it closure . given a function @xmath487",
    ", we can consider the following modified taylor expansion of @xmath45 around @xmath485 , @xmath488        given a map @xmath493 , we can approximate it by its discretization @xmath494 defined as @xmath495 .",
    "more concretely if @xmath496 is a linear bounded operator , we can compute the eigenvalues of the operator @xmath497 in order to study the spectrum of @xmath496 .",
    "in general the eigenvalues of @xmath497 might have nothing to do with the spectrum of @xmath496 .",
    "for example an infinite - dimensional operator does not need to have eigenvalues , but a finite - dimensional one will always have the same number of eigenvalues ( counted with multiplicity ) as the dimension of the space .",
    "for this reason will do some numerical test on the results obtained with this discretization .    at this point consider the map @xmath498 defined by equation ( [ equation maps l_omega ] ) . if we set @xmath499 we can use the method described above in each component of @xmath337 to discretize @xmath136 and approximate it by a map @xmath500 . concretely in our computation we have taken @xmath501 and @xmath502 . in figure",
