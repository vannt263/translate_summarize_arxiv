    "positron excess in the energy range @xmath6 has been observed by pamela , fermi and ams02  @xcite . assuming its dm - origin , this excess can be explained by annihilating dm with thermally - averaged cross section @xmath7@xmath8/s , or decaying dm with lifetime @xmath9s .",
    "it is also well known that for annihilating dm a large boost factor @xmath10  @xcite is needed to fit the positron spectra .",

    "@xcite for example ) .",
    "the key observation in this paper is that this light scalar @xmath2 can be identified as a dark higgs field which is generically present in the dm models with local dark gauge symmetries . in the following",
    ", we shall construct such dark matter models that are renormalizable and whose dynamics is completely fixed by local dark gauge symmetry . in those models , one can induce the above dim-4 operator where the dimensionless effective coupling @xmath22 is suppressed by heavy mass scales in the intermediate states . in our model , @xmath2 will be a new light scalar field ( dark higgs ) that would eventually decay into light lepton pairs through higgs portal interaction , and @xmath16 is the sm neutrino field . there is also @xmath23 final state due to the mixing between @xmath16 and @xmath0 in a definite ratio , and we account for it for completeness .",

    "the constraint from the @xmath20-ray , especially from the galaxy center region in case of dm pair annihilation , is also largely dependent on the assumed dm density profile .",

    "@xcite for comparison for example ) .",

    "assuming dark higgs and dark photon are below the dipion threshold @xmath159 , we could evade the stringent bounds from antiproton and gamma - ray flux measured by fermi / lat and other collaborations .",

    "<S> positron excess observed by pamela , fermi and ams02 may be due to dark matter ( dm ) pair annihilation or decay dominantly into muons . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a scenario with thermal fermionic dm ( @xmath0 ) with mass @xmath1 tev decaying into a dark higgs ( @xmath2 ) and an active neutrino ( @xmath3 ) instead of the sm higgs boson and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we first present a renormalizable model for this scenario with local dark @xmath4 gauge symmetry , in which the dm @xmath0 can be thermalized by higgs portal and the gauge kinetic mixing . assuming the dark higgs ( @xmath2 ) mass is in the range @xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> , the positron excess can be fit if a proper background model is used , without conflict with constraints from antiproton and gamma - ray fluxes or direct detection experiments . </S>",
    "<S> also , having such a light dark higgs , the self - interaction of dm can be enhanced to some extent , and three puzzles in the cdm paradigm can be somewhat relaxed . </S>"
