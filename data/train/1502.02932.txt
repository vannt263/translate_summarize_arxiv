    "the @xmath12 resonances with masses in the region around 4000 mev have stirred the hadron community with a series of states that challenge the common wisdom of mesons as made from @xmath6 .",
    "there has been intense experimental work done at the babar , belle , cleo , bes and other collaborations , and many hopes are pinned in the role that the future fair facility with the panda collaboration and j - parc will play in this field .",
    "there are early experimental reviews on the topic @xcite and more recent ones @xcite . from the theoretical point of view",
    "there has also been an intensive activity trying to understand these intriguing states .",
    "there are quark model pictures @xcite and explicit tetraquark structures @xcite . molecular interpretations",
    "are given in refs .",
    "much progress also has been done using the heavy quark spin symmetry ( hqss ) @xcite .",
    "predictions using qcd sum rules have also brought some light into the issue @xcite .",
    "strong decays of these resonances have been studied to learn about the nature of these states @xcite , while very often radiative decays are invoked as a tool to provide insight into this problem @xcite , although there might be exceptions as discussed in ref .",
    "it has even been speculated that some states found near thresholds of two mesons could just be cusps , or threshold effects @xcite .",
    "however , this speculation was challenged in ref .",
    "@xcite which showed that the near threshold narrow structures can not be simply explained by kinematical threshold cusps in the corresponding elastic channels but require the presence of @xmath13-matrix poles . along",
    "this latter point one should also mention a recent work calling the attention to possible effects of singularities on the opposite side of the unitary cut that enhance the cusp structure for states with mass above a threshold @xcite .",
    "some theoretical reports on these issues can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , and somewhat unexpected , recent experiments on the weak decays of @xmath14 meson are proving to be a powerful source of information on hadron dynamics and the nature of hadronic states @xcite .",
    "one of the recent surprises was to see from these experiments a pronounced peak for the @xmath15 in @xmath16 decay into @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xcite while the signal for the @xmath19 was found very small or non - existent .",
    "simultaneously , in the analogous decay of @xmath20 into @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xcite a signal was seen for the @xmath19 production and only a very small fraction was observed for the @xmath15 production .",
    "this is surprising since the @xmath19 couples more strongly to @xmath18 than to the @xmath15 .",
    "some attempt to explain this behaviour was offered in ref .",
    "@xcite in terms of tetraquark structures for the scalar mesons .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath19 and @xmath15 resonances are naturally explained as states dynamically generated from the meson - meson interaction in chiral unitary theory @xcite . from this perspective the features observed in these experiments and different ratios were well described in ref .",
    "@xcite . the basic approach in ref .",
    "@xcite was to identify the dominant mechanism of the decays at the quark level , implementing the hadronization of the final @xmath6 pair into two mesons and allowing them to interact to generate the @xmath19 and @xmath15 resonances .",
    "the picture of ref .",
    "@xcite has been extended to describe many other @xmath14 and @xmath21 decays , with equal success in the description of observed features of the reactions . in ref .",

    "similarly , the @xmath16 decay into @xmath33 was studied with the aim of learning about @xmath34 scattering and the @xmath35 resonance @xcite .",
    "related work to this latter one was done studying the semileptonic @xmath36 and @xmath14 decays in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "related problems of these weak decays have been addressed in refs .",
    "@xcite from a very different point of view , evaluating microscopically the weak matrix elements and parametrizing parts of this interaction plus properties of the resonances produced , then carrying fits to data .",
    "the aims are also usually different , having in mind the construction of full amplitudes that can be used for issues like @xmath37 violation . on the contrary , the work of ref . @xcite and the related ones make predictions for shapes and ratios that are tied to the final state interaction of mesons and , consequently , parameter free predictions",
    "can be made for these observables .",
    "so far , in the study of these @xmath14 decays the production of @xmath12 states has not yet been addressed and the aim of the present paper is to study reactions where these states can be produced , evaluating ratios for different decay modes and estimating the absolute rates .",

    "this choice magnifies the decay rate , which should then be of the same order of magnitude as the @xmath49 , which also had the same diagram of the quark level prior to the hadronization of the @xmath42 to produce two mesons , in this case @xmath50 that couples later to the @xmath15 .",
    "the next step consists in introducing a new @xmath40 state with the quantum numbers of the vacuum , @xmath51 , and see which combinations of mesons appear when added to @xmath41 .",

    ".    the final state interaction of the @xmath10 and @xmath66 proceeds diagrammatically as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] . starting from eq .",
    "( [ eq : vv44 - 2 ] ) the analytical expression for the formation of the resonance @xmath2 is given by @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the loop function of the two intermediate meson propagators and @xmath69 is the coupling of the resonance to the @xmath70 meson pair .",
    "the formalism for @xmath0 runs parallel since the hadronization procedure is identical , coming from the @xmath41 , only the final state of @xmath40 is the @xmath45 rather than the @xmath44 .",
    "hence , the matrix element is identical to the one of @xmath1 , only the kinematics to different masses will change .",
    "there is one last point to consider which is the angular momentum conservation . for @xmath71 , we have the transition @xmath72 .",
    "parity is not conserved but the angular momentum is . by choosing the lowest orbital momentum @xmath73 , we see that @xmath74 for @xmath75 and @xmath76 for @xmath77",
    ". however , the dynamics will be different for @xmath78 .",
    "this means that we can relate @xmath79 with @xmath80 , @xmath81 with @xmath82 , @xmath83 with @xmath84 and @xmath85 with @xmath86 , but in addition we can relate @xmath81 with @xmath83 , and the same for @xmath82 with @xmath84 .",
    "hence in this latter case we also have a @xmath87 state for both resonances and the only difference between them is the different coupling to @xmath10 and @xmath66 , where the @xmath5 couples mostly to @xmath10 , while the @xmath3 couples mostly to @xmath66 .    the partial decay width of these transitions is given by @xmath88 which allows us to obtain the following ratios , where the different unknown constants @xmath89 , that summarize the production amplitude at tree level , cancel in the ratios : @xmath90 and @xmath91 where @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the @xmath4 , @xmath64 , @xmath5 and @xmath3 , respectively .",

    "@xcite due to the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite concerning heavy quark spin symmetry .",
    "it was found there that a factor @xmath98 has to be implemented in the hidden gauge coupling @xmath99 in order to account for the @xmath100 decay .",
    "however , this factor should not be implemented in the weinberg - tomozawa terms ( coming from exchange of vector mesons ) because these terms automatically implement this factor in the vertices of vector exchange .",
    "however in the work of ref .",
    "@xcite the coupling needed for @xmath100 had been used also in the weinberg - tomozawa term .",
    "the bindings were obtained by fitting subtraction constants in the @xmath101 function .",
    "we also do the same now , but with the present reduced interaction the @xmath101 function becomes more negative .",
    "we use now @xmath102 mev and @xmath103 .    in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ratio-1])-([eq : ratio-2 ] ) we summarize the results that we obtain , @xmath104 and @xmath105    as we can see , all the ratios are of the order of unity , however , the simplicity of these results should not be confused with a triviality .",
    "the ratios close to unity for the @xmath44 or @xmath31 production are linked to the fact that the resonances are dynamically generated from @xmath10 and @xmath66 , which are produced by the hadronization of the @xmath41 pair .",
    "the ratio for the @xmath106 is even more subtle since it is linked to the particular couplings of these resonances to @xmath10 and @xmath66 , which are a consequence of the dynamics that generates these states .",
    "actually , the ratios @xmath107 are based only on phase space and result from the elementary mechanisms of fig [ fig:1 ] .",
    "we would get the same ratios as far as the resonances are @xmath39 based .",
    "hence , even of these ratios do not prove the molecular nature of the resonances , they already provide valuable information telling us that they are @xmath39 based .",
    "the ratio @xmath108 provides more information since it involves two independent resonances and it is not just a phase space ratio .",
    "if we take into account only phase space then @xmath109 instead of the value @xmath110 that we obtain .    as for the absolute rates",
    ", we can establish an analogy to the @xmath111 decay , since the amplitudes of the quark level prior to hadronization are identical and both processes require hadronization of a @xmath40 pair into resonances .",
    "hence , we estimate the branching ratio for the production of these states of the order of @xmath7 @xcite . another estimate can be done starting from @xmath112 , which has a branching ratio of @xmath113 and reducing this rate by one order of magnitude which is the reduction factor that is found for hadronization in ref .",
    "@xcite . in both cases",
    "we find branching fractions of the order of @xmath7 , which are an order of magnitude bigger than many rates of the order of @xmath114 already catalogued in the pdg @xcite .",
    "given the fact that the ratios @xmath107 obtained are not determining the molecular nature of the resonances , but only on the fact that they are @xmath115 based , we propose a complementary test in the next section .",
    "in this section we propose a test that is linked to the molecular nature of the resonances .",
    "we study the decay @xmath8 or @xmath9 close to the @xmath10 and @xmath11 thresholds .",
    "let us now look to the process @xmath8 depicted in fig .",
    ".        the production matrix for this process will be given by @xmath116 where @xmath117 and @xmath118 stands for the @xmath119 and @xmath120 channels respectively .",

    "( [ eq : width ] ) for the coalescence production of the resonance in @xmath125 , we find @xmath126 where we have divided the ratio of widths by the phase space factor @xmath127 and multiplied by @xmath128 to get a constant value at threshold and a dimensionless magnitude",

    "we can see that the ratios are different for each case and have some structure .",
    "we observe that there is a fall down of the differential cross sections as a function of energy , as it would correspond to the tail of a resonance below threshold .",
    "we should also note that in the case of @xmath119 , we have produced the @xmath57 combination .",

    "we could predict five ratios for the production of these states , where unknown dynamics of the production processes cancels in the ratios .",
    "the procedure used a mechanism in which we have quark production at the elementary level , followed by hadronization of one final @xmath6 pair into two vectors and posterior final state interaction of this pair of vector mesons .",
    "this mechanism has been tested successfully in many other decays and given us confidence on the fairness of the predictions made .",

    "<S> we investigate the decay of @xmath0 and @xmath1 with @xmath2 being the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 resonances . under the assumption that these states are dynamically generated from the vector - vector interaction , </S>",
    "<S> as has been concluded from several theoretical studies , we use a reaction mechanism of quark production at the elementary level , followed by hadronization of one final @xmath6 pair into two vectors and posterior final state interaction of this pair of vector mesons to produce the resonances . with this procedure </S>",
    "<S> we are able to predict five ratios for these decays , which are closely linked to the dynamical nature of these states , and also predict the order of magnitude of the branching ratios which we find of the order of @xmath7 , well within the present measurable range . in order to further test the dynamical nature of these resonances we study </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath8 and @xmath9 decays close to the @xmath10 and @xmath11 thresholds and make predictions for the ratio of the mass distributions in these decays and the @xmath1 decay widths . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement of these decays rates can help unravel the nature of these resonances . </S>"
