    "one basic prediction of cosmological simulations is that during the early epoch of hierarchical galaxy formation , some of the most massive galaxies are already formed in major merger events ( e.g. , springel  @xcite ) .",
    "these mergers are believed to commonly trigger both agn and starburst activity in such early systems , which is regulated via agn feedback ( e.g. , hopkins @xcite ) .",
    "such feedback may be responsible for the present - day `` @xmath7@xmath8 '' relation between black hole mass and bulge velocity dispersion ( ferrarese & merritt @xcite ; gebhardt  @xcite ) .",
    "studies of molecular gas ( the requisite material to fuel star formation ) in young galaxies are an essential ingredient to understand their physical properties in more detail .",
    "molecular gas ( typically co ) has been detected in @xmath950 galaxies at @xmath5@xmath61 to date , revealing large molecular reservoirs of @xmath610@xmath3  in most cases ( see solomon & vanden bout @xcite for a review ) .",
    "however , these studies rely almost exclusively on the integrated properties of the line emission , as the molecular reservoirs in these distant galaxies are difficult to resolve . to date",
    ", only the @xmath5=4.69 and @xmath5=6.42 quasars br12020725 and sdssj1148 + 5251 , two of the most distant gas - rich galaxies could be resolved in molecular gas emission without the aid of gravitational magnification ( omont  @xcite ; carilli  @xcite ; walter  @xcite ) . in this letter , we report on high angular resolution ( 0.15@xmath1 ; 1.0kpc ) very large array ( vla ) observations of molecular gas in the host galaxy of bri13350417 , a dust - rich , optically identified quasar at a redshift of 4.41 , corresponding to only 1.4 gyr after the big bang . optical imaging with the hubble space telescope",

    "the co is more widespread than in nearby ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , but shows similar physical properties .",
    "we thus adopt a low ulirg co luminosity to h@xmath25 mass conversion factor of @xmath26=0.8(kpc@xmath27)@xmath12 ( downes & solomon @xcite ) rather than @xmath26=45(kpc@xmath27)@xmath12 as in nearby spiral galaxies ( e.g. , scoville & sanders @xcite ; solomon & barrett @xcite ) .",
    "such low @xmath26 are also found for @xmath28 submm galaxies ( tacconi et al .",
    "@xcite ) . ] of @xmath29 ,",
    "corresponding to about two thirds of the mass of @xmath30derived from the integrated emission seen in the naturally weighted dataset ( @xmath31=0.43@xmath40.02jy , in agreement with previous results by carilli  @xcite ) .",
    "accounting for the flux in the linewings that is not covered by our observations , the full reservoir has an estimated mass of @xmath32 .    at @xmath5=4.4074 ,",
    "the brightest peaks of the northern and southern components in the highest resolution map corresponds to beam - averaged , rest - frame brightness temperatures of @xmath24=61 @xmath4 9k and 40 @xmath4 9k ( see figure [ f2 ] ) .",
    "averaging over the area of the full  reservoir gives @xmath24=10.0 @xmath4 0.5k , which implies that part of the diffuse molecular structure may be rather cold .",
    "note that the minimum excitation temperature of  is @xmath33=16.6k , which however is only 1.8k above the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature at @xmath5=4.41 .      in figure [ f3 ] ,",
    "the  emission is shown in seven 44wide velocity channels , smoothed to a linear resolution of @xmath92kpc .",
    "the emission is clearly dynamically resolved and is moving , to first order , from north to south between the red and blue velocity channels ( i.e. , with increasing channel number ) .",
    "in addition , the center channel ( # 4 ) shows a bright , compact peak , which corresponds to a narrow velocity component .",
    "this peak is weighted down in the integrated line maps , and corresponds to the third small 3@xmath19 peak of the southern component in figure [ f2 ] ( labeled with its @xmath24 of 29 @xmath4 9k ) .",
    "figure [ f4 ] shows a composite color map of the velocity channel maps and a position - velocity ( @xmath34 ) diagram ( left panel ) .",
    "the middle panel includes all velocity channels , while the central channel ( covering the range from -22  to + 22 ) is excluded from the right panel .",
    "the emission is clearly moving from redshifted to blueshifted emission in the right panel .",
    "however , the emission in the ( green ) central channels does not follow the north - south extension , but also show an east - west extension , indicating an additional , distinct velocity component in the system .",
    "the overall peak of the emission where all components overlap ( seen as a ` white spot ' in the figure ) corresponds to the southern peak in the integrated line map .",
    "the velocity structure thus is more complex than that of a simple , inclined , rotating disk ( as also seen in the @xmath34 slice ) .",
    "the central , compact , narrow velocity component is likely associated with the optical quasar .",
    "however , the relative astrometry of the radio and optical observations ( storrie - lombardi @xcite ) is unfortunately not accurate enough at present to substantiate this conclusion .",
    "we present maps of the molecular gas distribution in a quasar host galaxy at @xmath5=4.4 at 1.0kpc spatial resolution .",
    "the vla data show that the molecular gas reservoir in this galaxy is not only distributed over a scale of @xmath95kpc , but also structured in velocity space .",
    "this is the first time that the molecular gas in a quasar host galaxy at such a high redshift ( or , indeed , at any redshift greater than @xmath90 ) has ever been resolved both spatially and dynamically over multiple beams ( except for the lensed system pssj2322 + 1944 at @xmath5=4.12 ; riechers et al .",
    "@xcite ) . the emission in",
    "is resolved into at least three distinct components harboring at least 12 @xmath2 10@xmath3  of molecular gas each , and at least another 2 @xmath2 10@xmath3  is found in the more diffuse molecular medium in between these concentrations .",
    "each of the subcomponents hosts a few times the molecular gas mass of nearby ulirgs such as arp220 ( downes & solomon @xcite ) .",
    "the brightest peak corresponds to a 1kpc diameter region with a gas surface density of @xmath35=2.3 @xmath2 10@xmath3kpc@xmath36 , which is by a factor of a few higher than in in the central regions of typical ulirgs ( e.g. , wilson et al .",
    "the total molecular gas mass and distribution are reminiscent of those in the @xmath5=4.69 and @xmath5=6.42 quasars br12020725 and sdssj1148 + 5251 ( omont  @xcite ; carilli @xcite ; riechers  @xcite ; walter  @xcite ) , albeit concentrated on almost an order of magnitude smaller scales than in br12020725 .",
    "the brightest peak of the  emission traces a region of 1kpc diameter where the gas has an average temperature of at least 61k ( depending on optical depth and beam dilution ) , which is at the high end of but comparable to temperatures in the central regions of nearby ulirgs ( e.g. , downes & solomon @xcite ) .",
    "however , in ulirgs , regions with molecular gas temperatures of 3060k are much more compact than 1kpc .",
    "the co excitation ladder in  is not constrained well at present .",
    "however , the excitation so far is consistent with being similar to the @xmath5=4.69 quasar host galaxy of br12020725 , for which models of collisional excitation predict a kinetic gas temperature of @xmath37=60k and a median gas density of @xmath38@xmath39 ( riechers et al.@xcite ) .",
    "if indeed @xmath40 , this would indicate that the brightest co peak is close to being resolved . also , it appears that the gas temperature and density are on the high end of but comparable to ulirgs , while the total gas mass is by about an order of magnitude higher .",
    "based on the fir luminosity and sed shape of the source ( @xmath41=3.1@xmath210@xmath42 ; benford et al .",
    "@xcite ) , a star formation rate ( sfr ) of 4650yr@xmath12 and a total dust mass of 2@xmath210@xmath43  can be derived.10@xmath44(yr@xmath12/ ) ( kennicutt @xcite ) . ]",
    "this does not account for possible heating of the dust by the agn . however , if the dust in this source has an extension and non - uniform distribution similar to that of the molecular gas , local heating ( rather than heating of a central source ) is likely to be responsible for most of the dust emission .",
    "this is consistent with the finding that the ( rest - frame ) 4.0 cm radio continuum emission in this source dominantly originates from extended , kpc - scale regions and shows a peak @xmath24 of only few times 10@xmath45k ( momjian et al.@xcite ) .",
    "such @xmath24 are typical for relativistic electrons from supernova remnants and the interstellar medium in nuclear starbursts , but by at least 2 orders of magnitude lower than found in agn - powered environments .",
    "this finding is also reflected in the fact that  follows the radio - fir correlation for star - forming galaxies ( carilli et al .",
    "the fir - derived sfr is by about an order of magnitude higher than in local ulirgs ; however , the ratio of sfr and total gas mass is consistent with the scaling relation for ulirgs ( solomon et al .",
    "@xcite ) and other high-@xmath5 galaxies ( solomon & vanden bout @xcite ; riechers et al .",
    "moreover , in the centers of nearby ulirgs , @xmath46 correlates with the sfr ( wilson et al .",
    "@xcite ) , which suggests that an increased availability of fuel for star formation at a certain density leads to an increased sfr . given its high @xmath46 on kpc scales , this also motivates the high derived sfr for .",
    "assuming that the gas is converted into stars at an efficiency of 510% as in giant molecular cloud cores ( e.g. , myers et al.@xcite ; scoville et al .",
    "@xcite ) , the sfr corresponds to a gas depletion timescale of 24 @xmath2 10@xmath47yr .",
    "if the molecular gas in this system was gravitationally bound , the co linewidth ( see sect .  2 ) and distribution would predict a dynamical mass of @xmath48=1.0 @xmath2 10@xmath49 , which could account for both the total molecular gas mass and the mass of the black hole of @xmath7=6 @xmath2 10@xmath43  ( shields @xcite ) , but not for a substantial fraction of a @xmath94@xmath210@xmath50  stellar bulge as predicted if the local @xmath7@xmath8 relation were to hold ( ferrarese & merritt @xcite ; gebhardt @xcite ) . ; however , the implied large co linewidths suggest that such a dynamical structure would not be virialized ( riechers et al.@xcite ) .",
    "] however , the overall structure of  looks rather disturbed , both spatially and in its velocity structure . while the general north - south extension of the source may be in agreement with rotating structure ,",
    "this is not the case for the central part of the emission , in particular the compact peak seen in the central channel .",
    "this , and the structure seen in the high - resolution  map ( figure [ f2 ] ) , are more reminiscent of the disturbed gas reservoirs in major mergers , such as seen in the nearby antennae ( ngc4038/39 , e.g. , wilson  @xcite ) .",
    "if  was an interacting system , the northern component may be in the process of merging with the southern component , which likely hosts the luminous quasar .",
    "the connecting component then may be the part where the two galaxies overlap and merge .",
    "note that this region alone would be massive enough to host more than 10 of the largest molecular complexes found in the overlap region of the antennae ( wilson  @xcite ) .",
    "cosmological simulations predict that the merger rates at @xmath5=4.4 are substantially higher than at @xmath5=0 .",
    "such scenarios imply that during the early epoch of hierarchical galaxy formation , some of the most massive galaxies form in major merger events ( e.g. , springel @xcite ) .",
    "such major , ` wet ' mergers are believed to commonly trigger both agn and starburst activity , and lead to high excitation of the molecular gas during both the hierarchical buildup of the host galaxy and the quasar phase ( e.g. , narayanan  @xcite ) . in simulations ,",
    "such objects often show multiple co emisson peaks , arising from molecular gas concentrations that have not yet fully coalesced .",
    "we conclude that the observed properties of  ( agn and extreme starburst activity , high co excitation , disturbed morphology over 5kpc scales ) are connected to the ongoing buildup of the quasar host galaxy .",
    "such a signpost of early galaxy assembly then could be considered direct observational proof of the scenarios proposed by cosmological simulations , and enable us to directly investigate the connection between quasar activity and high - mass merger events at early cosmic times .",
