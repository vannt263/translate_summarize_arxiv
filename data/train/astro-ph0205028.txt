    "though we can trust that the present development of stellar interiors modelling reproduces qualitatively the consecutive stages along the evolution of stars , there still remain appreciable quantitative discrepancies between theoretical predictions and empirical evidence , especiallly in that concern to the higher mass stars .",
    "that is not surprising since , on one hand , their modelling is intrinsically more difficult due to their more complex evolution , and on the other hand , very massive stars are rare because of its shorter lifetimes , so that there are scarce observational constraints .    during the last years",
    ", we have performed a campaign of observations of early magellanic stars in order to enrich the empirical knowledge of these objects , particularly in low metallicity regions .",
    "one of the new binaries discovered for which its light curve was completed is a @xmath3 mag star in the lh 54 ob association ( lucke & hodge 1970 ) .",
    "this star ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) is bright enough and has sufficiently big radial velocity excursions to be at scope of the 2.15-m telescope at casleo ( san juan , argentina ) for radial velocity measurements .",
    "hill et al .",
    "( 1994 ) identified this object as lh 54 - 425 and performed @xmath6 photometry , obtaining @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 . later on , oey ( 1996a ) obtained @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , listing this star as l54s-4 .",
    "ccd spectra were also obtained by oey ( 1996b ) with the argus multifiber spectrograph at the ctio 4-m telescope .",
    "the spectral type assigned by oey to this star was o4 iii ( f@xmath13 ) .",
    "she did not detect double lines at the phase of her observation .",
    "lh 54 - 425 is the earliest star of the ob association lh 54 , located at the east - side of the superbubble dem 192 ( davies , elliot & meaburn 1976 ) ( or n51d , henize 1956 ) that is probably related with its growth ( oey & smedley 1998 ) .",
    "lh 54 had been included in one of our selected fields for searching new eclipsing binaries .",
    "it was observed during four observing runs between 1998 and 2001 .",
    "lh 54 - 425 showed no eclipses , but exhibited small periodic luminosity changes of the order of @xmath14 mag , suggesting an ellipsoidal nature of the variability .",
    "for this reason we included it as subject for further spectroscopic study as soon as its light curve was sufficiently complete to compute a reasonably reliable ephemeris .",
    "ccd images of the region of lh 54 were obtained at casleo between 1998 and 2001 , with the same instrumentation described in ostrov et al .",
    "we derived a @xmath0 light curve from aperture photometry performed with daophot ( stetson 1987 , 1991 ) , and tied all the measurements to a unique instrumental system using several stars as local standards to reduce errors , as described in ostrov et al .",
    "we performed absolute photometry during a photometric night ( dec 3 , 1998 ) , obtaining @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
