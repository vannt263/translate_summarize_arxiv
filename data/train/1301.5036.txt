    "it has long been recognized that the solar neighborhood contains a population of young stars with ages and velocities similar to the pleiades , including the famous star ab dor ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "more recently , @xcite identified a concentration of stars associated with ab dor at @xmath1 @xmath2 20 pc of apparently similar age and velocity .",
    "using galactic 3d space velocities and youth indicators such as h@xmath7 emission , strong li absorption , strong x - ray emission , fast rotation , and color - magnitude diagram position , they identified 37 candidate member systems of the `` ab dor moving group '' , 9 of which appear to comprise a `` nucleus , '' including ab dor itself . a detailed examination of the age indicators for ab dor and its group members by @xcite convincingly demonstrated that the color - magnitude diagram and li depletion pattern for the group is suggestive of coevality with the pleiades open cluster ( hence a probable age of @xmath0125 myr ) .",
    "in the years since , additional members of the ab dor moving group have been proposed @xcite . @xcite have tested the membership of these stars , and proposed new members , using an iterative method involving the proximity of candidate stars to each other in uvwxyz space and to an adopted isochrone in absolute visual magnitude ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "if the stars in a moving group are to have shared a common origin , then like open clusters , they should exhibit not only similar space velocity , but also similar chemical composition . @xcite and",
    "@xcite examined the hr 1614 and wolf 630 moving groups , respectively , and have shown that using kinematics alone to group stars can be unreliable .",
    "these studies found that stars previously identified as group members based solely on their kinematics did not match the abundance patterns exhibited by the other stars in the group . moving groups such as these with larger velocity spread ( usually called `` _ superclusters _ '' ) are now believed to be created by dynamical perturbations caused by , e.g. , the galactic bar .",
    "they clearly have a wide ranges of ages @xcite , and hence are _ not _ useful samples for age - related studies of stars . when adopting ages for stars based on their membership to a kinematic group , it is important to know whether the group is consistent with being co - eval and co - chemical .    considering the utility of moving groups for understanding galactic kinematic and chemical evolution , and their interest as targets for planet imaging and circumstellar disk evolution surveys ,",
    "we have started a project to `` chemically tag '' some of the young , nearby stellar groups . in this contribution , we test whether purported members of the ab dor moving group could have a shared origin .",
    "we present a detailed kinematic and spectroscopic study of 10 stars identified by @xcite and @xcite as ab dor members .",
    "these authors have already demonstrated that these stars have li abundances consistent with other ab dor members , so we do not discuss li further .",
    "the 10 stars are a subsample of the `` stream '' members with low projected rotational velocity ( @xmath8sin@xmath9 @xmath10 20 km  s@xmath11 ) that are outside of the `` nucleus '' identified by @xcite .",
    "high resolution optical echelle spectra of the ab dor stream stars listed in table [ tab : pp ] were obtained on the nights of june 25 - 26 , 2010 with the mike spectrograph at the 6.5 m clay telescope at las campanas observatory .",
    "data was reduced using standard procedures in the iraf echelle package .",
    "these include bias correction , flat fielding , scattered light removal and wavelength calibration .",
    "the tilted slits were dealt with using the iraf mtools package . in order to assure measurement of clean , unblended spectral features , we limited our abundance analysis to the red ccd , therefore the resultant spectra have wavelength coverage from 4850 - 8500  , with a resolution of r @xmath2 60,000 and typical s / n @xmath2 200 - 300 per res . element . for reference ,",
    "our analysis was carried out with respect to an extremely high s / n solar spectrum from reflected light from the asteroid ceres , measured with the same telescope and setup .",
    "we followed a standard excitation / ionization balance approach to determine basic physical parameters from our stellar spectra @xcite . for our initial guesses of these parameters , we used photometric temperatures using the calibrations of @xcite and gravities from the tracks of @xcite .",
    "our input metallicity was assumed to be solar , and we calculated @xmath12 using equation 2 from @xcite .",
    "the largest sources of error in our abundances were uncertainties in the final physical parameters and uncertainties in the line measurements themselves .",
    "other sources of error , such as the log(@xmath13 ) values used in the line lists are eliminated ( to first order ) by our use of a differential abundance analysis .",
    "uncertainties in @xmath14 $ ] and the other physical parameters of each star were found using the method described in @xcite . because this method gave us unrealistically large uncertainties in log(@xmath15 ) , we adopted the log(@xmath15 ) uncertainties using the @xcite evolutionary tracks .",
    "the physical parameters are given in table [ tab : pp ] .",
    "in addition , we include measurements of the equivalent widths of the lithium doublet at 6707 .",
    "our measurements agree with those from @xcite .",
    "we also measured lines of , , , , , , , , and .",
    "using the temperature , gravity , microturbulence , and metallicity solution for each star , we determined the abundances relative to the sun , line by line .",
    "we used the mean abundance as our final value for each element and the standard error of the different line abundances as our uncertainty .",
    "when a single line was available , we adopted a conservative uncertainty of 0.10 dex . if more than one line was available , but all lines gave the same value ( standard error of 0 ) , we adopted a conservative uncertainty of 0.05 dex .",

    "these 3 stars , displayed in table [ tab : pop ] and shown in bold in fig .",
    "[ fig : sep ] , are also the 3 closest stars to the ab dor nucleus in the past .",

    "our combined chemical and kinematic results suggest that these values are most representative of the true ab dor group . _",
    "thus , we find that a subsample of the ab dor stream stars may constitute a kinematically and chemically coherent population , but that one should not assume that all stream stars have a common origin with one another or the ab dor nucleus . _",
    "the nature of the group of 5 chemically homogeneous stars in table [ tab : chi ] is more difficult to determine .",
    "only 2 of these stars have hipparcos parallaxes , so we could not run all 5 through our kinematic tests .",
    "it is possible that some or all of these stars could represent their own stream , distinct from ab dor , but we can not say this definitively without more precise kinematic data .",
    "we have obtained high - resolution spectra of 10 purported ab dor moving group `` stream '' members . using measured abundances for 10 elements ( including fe )",
    "we show that our sample of stream stars is statistically inconsistent with being chemically homogeneous .",
    "the abundance trends of these stars are consistent with field star trends , and our results suggest that perhaps half of the stream stars can be considered statistically chemically homogeneous , whereas the other half show slightly different chemical compositions which could reflect birth in regions other than ab dor s birthsite . due to the lack of statistical correlations between stellar activity indicators ( log(l@xmath36/l@xmath37 and h@xmath7 emission ) and the individual stellar abundances ,",
    "we surmise that stellar activity alone is unable to explain the observed spread in abundances .",
    "kinematically , only 5 of our stars have well determined 3d velocities , but we find that 2 of these were @xmath0400 - 600 pc away from the ab dor nucleus when it was born , whereas 3 of them ( which also appear to be statistically chemically homogeneous ) could have formed in ab dor s vicinity at the group s birth .",
    "this kinematically and chemically coherent group has mean metallicity of [ fe / h ] = 0.02@xmath50.02 dex , which we think is representative of the ab dor group .",
    "while there does appear to be an ab dor `` nucleus '' @xcite , it appears that a significant fraction of the outlying stream members found in @xcite and @xcite do not constitute a chemically homogeneous or kinematically coherent sample .",
    "we also demonstrate that the ab dor nucleus must be @xmath6110 myr based on the presence of 3 late k - type members which are clearly on the zero - age main sequence .",
    "this disagrees with the often - cited ages for the ab dor group and ab dor multiple system of @xmath040 - 100 myr .",
    "taking into account the findings of @xcite , the data are strongly in favor of coevality of the ab dor nucleus with the pleiades ( @xmath0125 myr ) .",
    "our survey shows that kinematics , color - magnitude positions , and stellar youth indicators alone are not necessarily sufficient for testing whether a kinematic group of stars actually shares a common origin .",
    "chemical tagging of purported members of moving groups provides an additional diagnostic for testing group membership , and holds promise for piecing together the recent chemo - kinematic history of star - formation in the solar vicinity .",
