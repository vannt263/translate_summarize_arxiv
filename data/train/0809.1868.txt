    "the clustering of galaxies depends on their properties , such as morphology ( e.g. , @xcite ) , luminosity ( e.g. , @xcite ) , color ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and spectral type ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "galaxy clustering thus provides important clues to the physics of galaxy formation",
    ". often found to reside in galaxy groups and clusters , luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) constitute the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function .",
    "clustering of lrgs encodes information about their environments , which are typically the central regions of groups and clusters .",
    "the lrg redshift sample @xcite of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) provides an enormous data set with which to measure the clustering of lrgs . in this paper",
    ", we perform theoretical modeling of auto - clustering of lrgs and cross - clustering of lrgs with other types of galaxies to understand the origin of their clustering properties , to learn how they are distributed among massive dark matter halos , and to aid the study of formation and evolution of massive galaxies .",
    "the theoretical understanding of galaxy clustering has been greatly enhanced through the framework of the halo occupation distribution ( hod , see , e.g. , @xcite ) and the closely related approach of the conditional luminosity function ( clf , @xcite ) .",
    "the hod formalism describes the bias relation between galaxies and matter at the level of individual virialized dark matter halos , whose distribution and properties can be readily predicted by numerical simulations or analytic models given a cosmological model .",
    "the key ingredients of this formalism are the probability distribution @xmath7 that a halo of mass @xmath8 contains @xmath9 galaxies of a given type and spatial and velocity distributions of galaxies within halos . in the clf approach ,",
    "the dependence of @xmath7 on galaxy luminosity is implicitly derived by inferring the conditional luminosity distribution of galaxies as a function of halo mass @xmath8 .",
    "given the hod / clf and the cosmology , any statistics of galaxy clustering on any scales can be predicted , therefore the hod / clf method provides a complete description of the bias relation between galaxies and dark matter .",
    "hod / clf modeling has been applied to interpret galaxy clustering measurements in several galaxy surveys ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "hod / clf analysis recasts galaxy clustering measurements into a form that is more physically informative and conducive for testing galaxy formation theories ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "the hod modeling results of the luminosity and color dependence of galaxy clustering are found to be in good qualitative agreement with predictions from galaxy formation models ( @xcite ) .    in this paper",

    "@xcite find a strong luminosity dependence of the lrg@xmath0 cross - clustering amplitude .",
    "the form of the luminosity dependence is itself dependent on scale , with more variation in the clustering amplitude on small scales .",
    "understanding all these auto- and cross - clustering features is one of the goals of our hod modeling .",
    "since lrgs trace massive halos , the cross - correlation between lrgs and @xmath0 galaxies also allows us to study the hod of @xmath0 galaxies in these massive halos .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in   2 , we briefly describe the sdss lrg and @xmath0 galaxy samples we use and our modeling method . in   3 , we describe our hod parameterization for lrg samples and @xmath0 samples . in   4 ,",
    "we perform hod modeling for lrg two - point auto - correlation functions and the two - point cross - correlation functions between lrgs and @xmath0 galaxies .",

    "finally , we summarize and discuss our results in   5 .",
    "we also include three appendices in the paper . in appendix",
    "[ sec : appendixa ] , we investigate which hod parameter plays the major role in the departures of the galaxy two - point correlation function from a pure power law . in appendix",
    "[ sec : appendixb ] , we present hod modeling results for two luminosity threshold lrg samples for different cosmological models . in appendix",
    "[ sec : appendixc ] , we have a brief discussion on the mass function of the most massive halos and the fluctuation of the number of massive halos in the volume probed by the sdss lrg samples .",

    ".    the two - point cross - correlation functions between spectroscopic lrg samples and the imaging @xmath0 galaxy sample in the sdss at @xmath27 are measured by @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 galaxy sample we model is the one defined by the luminosity range @xmath28 to @xmath29 , which is called the @xmath29 sample in @xcite . for the lrg sample in the cross - clustering ,",
    "we adopt the luminosity - bin sample defined by @xmath30 .",
    "we essentially follow the method presented in @xcite and adopt the improvements of @xcite for theoretical modeling of the two - point auto- and cross - correlation functions in the hod framework . in this paper , more general hod parameterizations",

    "appendix b presents the dependence of the derived hod parameters on @xmath46 and @xmath47 for a five - parameter hod model .",
    "the mean redshift of the above lrg and @xmath0 samples is around 0.3 and our model calculations take this into account , i.e. , all halo properties are calculated at @xmath18 for the adopted cosmology . in general , the comoving unit is adopted for distance , but to be compatible with @xcite , we also use proper units with explicit mention when discussing the cross - clustering .",
    "finally , we assume @xmath48 when quoting magnitudes throughout the paper .",
    "the two lrg samples for which the two - point auto - correlation functions are modeled are nearly luminosity - threshold samples .",
    "the lrg samples defined in the cross - correlation measurements in @xcite are luminosity - bin samples .",
    "we concentrate on the cross - correlation between @xmath0 galaxies and @xmath30 lrgs , together with the two - point auto - correlation functions of the two luminosity - threshold samples with @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the three lrg samples with different luminosity cuts provide leverage to constrain the relation between galaxy luminosity and halo mass .",
    "we therefore first parameterize the lrg hod in a way that includes the luminosity information .    for hod parameterization",
    ", it has been found to be useful to separate contributions from central and satellite galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "central galaxy luminosity is correlated with the host halo mass .",
    "based on predictions of galaxy formation models ( @xcite ) , we assume that at a fixed halo mass the central galaxy luminosity follows a log - normal distribution and the mean luminosity of this distribution has a power - law form @xmath49 , with @xmath50 independent of halo mass in the range that lrgs probe . in terms of absolute magnitudes , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the mean luminosity in halos with a pivot mass @xmath53 and is simply set to be @xmath54 .",
    "we note that in this paper @xmath8 with a subscript `` _ g _ '' stands for the @xmath17-band absolute magnitude , while that without the subscript `` _ g _ '' is used for halo mass . with a constant standard deviation @xmath55 in magnitude ,",
    "the luminosity distribution of central galaxies in halos of mass @xmath8 is then @xmath56.\\ ] ] lrg samples are not defined purely through luminosity , since there is a color cut in the lrg selection .",
    "therefore , for an lrg sample with @xmath57 , the mean occupation function of central galaxies is calculated as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the lrg selection function at a given luminosity .",
    "based on the lrg luminosity function and the total galaxy luminosity function , we approximate the selection function as @xmath60 in the range @xmath61 , 0 for @xmath62 , and 1 for @xmath63 .",
    "the hod of a luminosity - bin galaxy sample is just the difference of those of two luminosity - threshold samples .",
    "the theoretically predicted mean occupation function of satellite galaxies for a luminosity - threshold sample is close to a power law ( @xcite ) . here",
    ", we adopt a more flexible parameterization , which can give us a better idea on the constraining power of the two - point clustering on the hod . for each luminosity - threshold lrg sample , we parameterize the hod of satellite lrgs through the mean occupation numbers at five mass scales , and the the mean occupation function is assumed to be a cubic spline curve passing through the five points ( see @xcite ) .",
    "linear extrapolations are used outside of the ranges of the five points .",
    "in addition , we impose the central galaxy cutoff profile @xmath64 to @xmath65 .",
    "the five mass scales are chosen to be @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "the mean occupation function of satellites in a luminosity - bin sample is obtained by interpolating the values of @xmath68 for the two luminosity - threshold samples ( linearly in @xmath69 ) .",
    "the satellite occupation number around the mean is assumed to follow the poisson distribution ( @xcite ) .",
    "the parameterization of the halo occupation of lrgs we present here is a hybrid of the clf framework ( @xcite ) and the hod framework ( @xcite )  the distribution of central lrgs is put in a clf form , while that of the satellite lrgs is in the usual hod form .",
    "this combination allows us to infer information on how luminosity of central galaxies changes with halo mass and at the same time to keep a reasonable number of free parameters .    with the above parameterized hod",
    ", we can easily form the mean occupation functions for the two luminosity - threshold lrg samples and the luminosity - bin sample given their luminosity cuts .",
    "the thirteen free parameters are the pivot mass scale @xmath53 and the slope @xmath50 in the luminosity - mass relation , the scatter @xmath55 of the luminosity distribution of central lrgs , and the total of ten spline points of @xmath65 for the two luminosity - threshold samples . in appendix  [ sec : appendixb ] , we provide hod modeling results for the two luminosity threshold samples and their cosmology dependence based on a simpler five - parameter hod model .",
    "the @xmath0 sample in @xcite is at a mean redshift @xmath13 . to parameterize the hod of this @xmath0 sample , we make use of the modeling result in @xcite at @xmath70 .",
    "the @xmath0 galaxy sample is a luminosity - bin sample @xmath71 , which can be regarded as the difference between two luminosity - threshold samples , @xmath72 and @xmath73 . as shown in @xcite , at low redshifts , for threshold samples of a fixed ( comoving ) galaxy number density , the shape of the mean occupation function as a function of redshift approximately remains unchanged .",
    "we take the advantage of this presumed property and construct the mean occupation function for @xmath0 galaxies at @xmath13 based on the hods of @xmath70 galaxies .",
    "we first find out the number densities of the two luminosity - threshold samples with @xmath72 and @xmath73 at @xmath27 . to do this , we adopt the evolution model of the luminosity function in @xcite set to @xmath18 and obtain the two number densities as @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "we find the luminosity thresholds @xmath76 and @xmath77 for @xmath70 galaxies that match the two number densities , @xmath78 and @xmath79 we then use the results presented in @xcite to infer the hods at @xmath70 for luminosity - threshold samples with @xmath76 and @xmath77 as the thresholds .",
    "finally , we take the difference of these two hods to infer the mean occupation function for galaxies in the @xmath80 luminosity bin , @xmath81 we take the _ shape _ of this mean occupation function as that for the @xmath0 galaxies at @xmath13 .",
    "the form of this mean occupation function is a sum of a square window for central galaxies and a power law with an index @xmath82 for satellites . with the shape fixed , we allow the mean occupation function to shift in mass scales . furthermore , we add freedom to the high mass slope , as described below , because we have better data to constrain it .",
    "as shown later , the small - scale two - point cross - correlation between @xmath0 galaxies and lrgs comes from satellite @xmath0 galaxies paired with lrgs . as our goal here",
    "is to investigate the @xmath0 occupation in high mass halos , it is necessary to introduce additional degrees of freedom in the mean occupation function of the satellite @xmath0 galaxies in massive halos .",
    "we only adopt the @xmath13 mean occupation function for @xmath0 satellites , as constructed above , up to @xmath83 , and introduce another power law to represent the mean occupation function of ( satellite ) @xmath0 galaxies in halos more massive than @xmath83 .",
    "we assume this occupation distribution follows the poisson distribution with the mean in the form of @xmath84 . here",
    "@xmath85 is a pivot mass scale fixed to be @xmath86 , @xmath87 is the mean occupation number of @xmath0 galaxies in halos of this pivot mass , and @xmath88 denotes the slope at the high mass end .",
    "the scale of the pivot mass is chosen to minimize the correlation between @xmath87 and @xmath88 . in order to have more flexibility",
    ", we do not impose continuity at @xmath83 .    at first glance ,",
    "our construction of the @xmath0 hod seems complex , involving theoretical priors and introducing an artificial break in the satellite occupation function . a more general hod model for @xmath0 galaxies",
    "could be obtained by parameterizing the hods of two luminosity threshold samples and taking their difference ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , we only have a small number of data points from the lrg-@xmath0 cross - correlation functions to constrain the @xmath0 hod .",
    "the constraints on the low mass part of the @xmath0 hod ( especially the mean occupation function for central galaxies ) come from the the number density of the @xmath0 sample and the large scale bias of the cross - correlation .",
    "the shape of the low mass part of a general @xmath0 hod can not be well constrained by either the number density or the large scale bias , given that the halo bias factor in this mass range only increases slowly .",
    "the constraints to the high mass part of the @xmath0 hod come from the small - scale cross - correlation with the lrgs .",
    "our procedure of the @xmath0 hod parameterization reduces the degrees of freedom in the low mass part of the hod and allows some flexibility in the high mass part of the hod which is our focus .",
    "although our parameterization is a restricted one , it is suitable for our purpose of understanding clustering properties in @xmath0-lrg cross - correlation . to summarize , we allow the low mass end of the mean occupation function ( a square window plus the low - mass power law ) to have an overall horizontal shift with the shape fixed .",
    "the main role of shifting the low mass part of the @xmath0 hod is to match the number density of the @xmath0 sample and the large scale bias of the cross - correlation , while the high mass part of the occupation function of @xmath0 galaxies that we are interested in determines the small - scale cross - correlation with the lrgs .",
    "the distribution profile of @xmath0 satellite galaxies inside halos is assumed to follow the navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) profile ( @xcite ) with a concentration parameter @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the nonlinear mass at @xmath27 and @xmath91 is fixed to -0.13 ( @xcite ) . as a whole",
    ", there are four free parameters in the @xmath0 hod , the overall horizontal shift of the low mass part , the high mass amplitude @xmath87 and slope @xmath88 of the mean occupation function , and the halo concentration parameter @xmath92 extrapolated to the nonlinear mass scale . to compute the one - halo term of lrg@xmath0 cross - correlation",
    ", we make the simplifying assumption that the occupation number of lrgs and that of @xmath0 galaxies inside the same halo are uncorrelated .",
    "that is , @xmath93 .",
    "we discuss the effect of this assumption on our modeling results in   4 .",
    "we model simultaneously the two - point auto - correlation functions of the two luminosity - threshold lrg samples ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) and the two - point cross - correlation function between the @xmath0 and the luminosity - bin ( @xmath30 ) lrg sample .",
    "altogether , there are seventeen free parameters , four for the @xmath0 hod and thirteen for the lrg hod .    in addition to the sum of @xmath37s from the two auto - correlation functions and the cross - correlation function",
    ", we also add the number densities of the two threshold lrg samples and the @xmath0 galaxies into the overall @xmath37 .",
    "that is , @xmath94 where @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 are the vectors of auto - correlation functions of the two lrg samples and the lrg@xmath0 cross - correlation function , and @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) are the three number densities .",
    "the observed values are denoted with a superscript @xmath100 .",
    "the full covariance matrix is used for each correlation function and 10% fractional errors are assumed for each of the galaxy number densities .",
    "the three covariance matrices , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 are estimated using jackknife resampling .",
    "for each of the two lrg samples , 104 jackknife subsamples are used @xcite for estimating the covariance among 10 data points . for the lrg-@xmath0 cross - correlation",
    ", the covariance among 6 data points is estimated with 50 jackknife subsamples @xcite .",
    "@xcite performed extensive tests with mock catalogs to access the reliability of the jackknife error estimates in projected correlation functions over a similar range of separations .",
    "they used 100 mock catalogs with the same geometry and angular completeness as the sdss sample and similar clustering properties , created using the pthalos method of @xcite .",
    "their tests showed that the jackknife method is a robust way to estimate the error covariance matrix , especially for the relatively large volumes probed here .",
    "this holds as long as the number of jackknife realizations , @xmath104 , is significantly larger than the dimension of the data vector , @xmath50 .",
    "@xcite discusses related issues , pointing out a potential bias in general model fitting which depends on the ratio of @xmath50 to @xmath104 . as a crude test of our error uncertainties ,",
    "we incorporate their proposed method to remove this bias by multiplying the inverse of the covariance matrix by a factor of @xmath105 . in our case , this factor is about 0.9 . we perform this for the @xmath106 lrg sample , resulting in a @xmath107 increase in the uncertainties of the hod parameters , but no noticeable change in the best - fit values .",
    "we note that the results presented later in this paper do not include such a correction .",
    "we assume the different clustering measurements to be independent , ignoring possible correlations between statistical errors across correlation functions and number densities of different samples . strictly speaking ,",
    "such statistical correlations are not zero .",
    "for example , the @xmath22 lrg sample includes lrgs with @xmath23 , therefore the auto - correlation functions of the @xmath22 and @xmath23 samples are partially correlated .",
    "these correlations could be estimated with the jackknife technique , but they would be noisy . neglecting such correlations might make the constraints on the hod parameters somewhat tighter than they should be , which is a caveat for interpreting our results .",
    "we adopt a markov chain monte carlo technique ( mcmc ; e.g. , @xcite ) to explore the hod parameter space . at each point of the chain",
    ", we take a random walk in the parameter space to generate a new set of hod parameters .",
    "the step - size of the random walk for each parameter is drawn from a gaussian distribution .",
    "the probability to accept the new set of hod parameters depends on the difference between @xmath108 and @xmath109 ( the values of @xmath37 for the new and old models ) : 1 for @xmath110 and @xmath111 $ ] for @xmath112 .",
    "flat priors in logarithmic space are adopted for the lrg satellite occupation numbers at the ten spline points and the pivot mass scale @xmath53 and for @xmath87 and mass scale shift of @xmath0 galaxies .",
    "flat priors in linear space are used for other hod parameters .",
    "the total number of data points to model is 29 ( 10 + 10 auto - correlation measurements for the two lrg samples , 6 lrg-@xmath0 cross - correlation measurements , and 3 number densities ) .",
    "the number densities are well reproduced by our model , with the median values 1.1-@xmath113 , 0.4-@xmath113 , and 0.1-@xmath113 away from the observed ones for the two lrg and the @xmath0 samples .",
    "our model has 17 free parameters and therefore the number of degree of freedom is 12 .",
    "we find that the best - fit model has @xmath114 .",
    "the probability for a @xmath37 value higher than our best - fit @xmath37 is 1.5% .",
    "( including the @xcite correction gives @xmath115 and the probability increases to @xmath124% ) .",
    "the relatively - large @xmath37 values might be partly caused by our neglecting the correlation between statistical errors across correlation functions and number densities of different samples .",
    "it also indicates that the accuracy in our analytical model of the two - point galaxy correlation function needs to be improved and that our hod parameterization is not perfect . with the above caveats in mind",
    ", we present our modeling results below .        figure  [ fig : wp_lrg ] shows the fitting results for the two luminosity - threshold lrg samples .",
    "figure  [ fig : wp_lrg]_a _ shows the best - fit projected two - point correlation functions together with the measurements . for the @xmath22 sample , the one - halo and two - halo components ( dot - dashed curves ) of the fit are also shown . in figure",
    "[ fig : wp_lrg]_b _ , the mean occupation function for each sample is plotted , separating into contributions from central ( dotted ) and satellite ( dashed ) galaxies .",
    "the range of mean occupation functions with @xmath116 is denoted by the shaded region ( @xmath116 is chosen so that the envelopes are sampled by a large number of mcmc points and the range delineated by the envelopes can be clearly seen in the plot ) .",
    "as in @xcite , the amplitude of the high halo mass end of the mean occupation function is poorly constrained by two - point correlation functions . since the abundance of halos drops exponentially at the high mass end , the two - halo pairs are mostly contributed by lower mass halos .",
    "although the number of one - halo pairs per halo rises roughly as @xmath117 , the exponential drop of the number of high mass halos also makes most one - halo pairs come from lower mass halos .",
    "overall , the two - point correlation function is dominated by signals from halos of lower mass where @xmath118@xmath12 a few , leading to the poor constraints on the hod at the very high mass end .",
    "the constraint on the high mass end _ slope _ of @xmath65 for the faint lrg sample appears to be relatively strong , and we discuss its possible implications in   [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "the results show that the host halos of lrgs are massive , above @xmath83 , corresponding to large galaxy groups and clusters , which is consistent with studies of the environment of luminous galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we find that as the threshold luminosity increases by a factor of @xmath121.7 , the mass scale of host halos shifts by a factor of @xmath119 , which implies a correlation between the luminosity @xmath4 of the central lrg and the mass @xmath8 of the host halo in the form of @xmath120 .",
    "lrgs are often thought to be the central elliptical galaxies of galaxy groups of clusters .",
    "our results clearly show that a fraction of the lrgs have to be satellite galaxies .",
    "the main constraint for this comes from the high amplitudes of the correlation function at small scales . without satellite lrgs ,",
    "the projected correlation function would flatten out toward small scales , similar in shape to the two - halo term shown in figure  [ fig : wp_lrg]_a_. to explain the rising small - scale clustering , the one - halo term has to be introduced , hence we require the existence of satellite lrgs .",
    "however , the fits imply that only a small fraction of lrgs are satellites : 5.26.2% and 2.33.2% in the @xmath22 and @xmath23 samples , respectively , as shown in figure  [ fig : wp_lrg]_c_. the steeper rise of the small scale clustering makes the two - point correlation function of the brighter lrg sample deviate from a power law more prominently . in appendix",
    "[ sec : appendixa ] , we investigate the key ingredients that lead to the departure from a power law and provide insight as to why the departure becomes more clear for samples that are more luminous ( as shown here ) and for samples at higher redshifts ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the mean occupation function tells us the mean number of lrgs as a function of the halo mass .",
    "the result can be viewed differently by asking what the probability distribution of masses of halos hosting such lrgs would be .",
    "the probability is simply the product of the mean occupation function and the differential halo mass function .",
    "we show such probability distributions from the mcmc run in figure  [ fig : wp_lrg]_d_. the distribution of @xmath22 lrgs peaks at @xmath121 , and for @xmath23 lrgs the peak shifts to higher mass , @xmath122 .",
    "both distributions span a large range in halo mass .",
    "the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) for either distribution is about @xmath123 . since only a small fraction of lrgs",
    "are satellites , the probability distribution is almost determined by the central lrgs . only in halos more massive than a few times",
    "@xmath124 does the number of satellites in a halo become significant ( i.e. , greater than one on average ) , and around this mass scale a low amplitude shoulder in the distribution emerges . in fwhm sense , we find that @xmath22 and @xmath23 lrgs reside in halos of mass 213@xmath125 and 425@xmath125 , respectively .    from the mean occupation functions in figure  [ fig : wp_lrg]_b _ ,",
    "one also notices that , compared with the samples of lower luminosities in @xcite , the low mass cutoff profiles for the lrg samples are better constrained .",
    "the relatively tight constraints come from the steepening both in the halo mass function and in the mass dependence of the halo bias factor toward high halo mass .",

    "we caution , however , that the definition of the @xmath146 ratio becomes more parameterization dependent at high galaxy luminosities because the scatter between luminosity and halo mass is larger ( i.e. , the low mass cutoff of the hod is less sharp ) .",

    "there is less time for the orbit of satellites in a massive halo to decay through dynamical friction and for them to merge with the central galaxy to form a larger ( brighter ) central galaxy .",
    "in addition , the lrg samples we study are at redshift @xmath148 , which makes the accretion even more dominant .",
    "therefore , the decrease in the ratio of @xmath131 and @xmath130 could be a manifestation of the favor of accretion over destruction in massive halos .",
    "the cross - correlation between luminosity - bin lrg sample ( @xmath30 ) and the @xmath0 galaxies also leads to constraints on the hod of the luminosity - bin lrg sample .",
    "the lower ( solid ) curves in the right panel of figure  [ fig : crossnavg ] are the @xmath116 envelope of the mean occupation function of the @xmath30 lrgs .",
    "the bump ( dotted ) around @xmath122 is the contribution from central galaxies and the dashed curves represent contributions from satellites .",
    "the result shows that most of the lrgs in this luminosity bin are central galaxies in halos of mass @xmath12220@xmath125 , and a small fraction ( @xmath127% ) of them are satellites in more massive halos .",
    "@xcite perform hod modeling of the two - point auto - correlation functions of the main galaxy sample and show that the two - point function can impose important constraints on the hod of a sample of galaxies . in general , the mean occupation function is tightly constrained around @xmath149 a few .",
    "it becomes loosely constrained towards higher halo masses because the two - point correlation function is less sensitive to the occupation distribution in these halos as a result of the steep drop of the halo mass function .",
    "therefore , the analyses of the main galaxy sample with low luminosity thresholds in @xcite can not quite reveal how these low luminosity galaxies reside in massive halos .",
    "since lrgs automatically pick out the massive halos , the cross - correlation between main sample galaxies and lrgs provides us a nice way to study the halo occupation of main sample galaxies in massive halos , enabling us to better constrain the hod of @xmath0 galaxies in massive halos .",
    "figure  [ fig : crosspar]_d _ shows constraints on the concentration parameter @xmath92 and the high mass slope @xmath88 of the mean occupation function for @xmath0 galaxies , marginalized over the other parameters .",
    "these two parameters are correlated in a sense that a higher @xmath92 corresponds to a higher @xmath88 .",
    "higher @xmath88 means that more @xmath0 galaxies reside in higher mass halos with lower concentrations and larger virial radius , so to maintain the small - scale ( cross-)clustering the distribution of galaxies need to be more concentrated , i.e. , a higher @xmath92 .",
    "the high mass slope of the mean occupation function of @xmath0 galaxies is @xmath150 ( 1-@xmath113 range ) , steeper than the value 1.10 at lower mass .",
    "the concentration parameter @xmath92 represents the value extrapolated to @xmath90 according to @xmath151 .",

    "the mean occupation function of @xmath0 galaxies in massive halos is shown as upper ( solid ) curves in the right panel of figure  [ fig : crossnavg ] .",
    "these two curves are the envelope determined by @xmath116 . on average ,",
    "about ten @xmath0 galaxies are expected to reside in a halo of mass @xmath122 .",
    "our fits show that the mean occupation function of @xmath0 galaxies at high halo masses becomes steeper than the slope 1.10 at intermediate masses ( and lower redshift ) .",
    "we have also run a model with fixed slope 1.10 for the satellite mean occupation function in the whole mass range .",
    "the fits to the lrg auto - correlation function and the lrg-@xmath0 cross - correlation function become much worse , with the overall @xmath37 increasing by @xmath1250 .",
    "the resulting best fit to the cross - correlation function is plotted in the left panels of figure  [ fig : crossnavg ] .",
    "the lower panel shows the fractional difference between the fits ( thick curve for the flexible model and thin curve for the one with fixed slope ) and the data .",
    "the fit from the model with fixed slope is almost on top of the one from the more flexible model , but the error bars in the measurement are small and the change in @xmath37 is substantial ( an increase of @xmath157 in the @xmath37 contributed by the cross - correlation function ) .",
    "the corresponding high - mass end of the mean occupation function of @xmath0 galaxies from this more restricted model is shown as the dot - dashed line in the right panel of figure  [ fig : crossnavg ] .",
    "the single - slope model has more @xmath0 satellites in halos less massive than @xmath124 , and the best - fit concentration parameter for @xmath0 galaxies is about a factor of two smaller ; these two effects compensate each other to approximately maintain the amplitude of the small - scale cross - correlation . unless the error bars in the measurements",
    "were underestimated ( e.g. , by a factor of two ) , the restricted model is highly disfavored by its much worse fits to the data ( @xmath158 ) .",
    "the cause and implication of the steep inferred high mass slope of the @xmath0 galaxy occupation function is not clear .",
    "it may be related to the selection of @xmath0 galaxies  the sample used here is composed of galaxies in a bin of 1.5 magnitude around a redshift - dependent reference magnitude that is supposed to match @xmath0 at @xmath27 @xcite . since the redshift range ( @xmath159 ) is not narrow , the @xmath0 sample should be regarded as an effective sample , rather than a uniform sample .",
    "it may also be caused by the imperfection in the analytic model of the two - point cross - correlation function .",
    "the small measurement errors in the two - point cross - correlation function may require a more accurate model than the one used in this paper , and allowing for uncertainty in the model accuracy would increase the allowed range of the high mass slope .",
    "finally , it may also be related to the assumption that the occupation numbers of lrgs and @xmath0 galaxies in the same halo are uncorrelated (   3.2 ) .",
    "since the effect of any correlation between the two occupation numbers becomes smaller as halo mass increases @xcite , an anti - correlation between the lrg and @xmath0 occupation numbers would lead to a decrease in the high mass slope of the @xmath0 galaxy to conserve the number of lrg@xmath0 pairs . as a whole",
    ", we therefore have higher confidence in the value of @xmath160 at @xmath161 , where the fits from the two models cross , than we have in the slope @xmath88 itself .",
    "the modeling result also shows ( see the left panel of figure  [ fig : crossnavg ] ) that the lrg@xmath0 cross - correlation function is dominated by central lrgs paired with satellite @xmath0 galaxies on scales less than @xmath162 ( comoving ) , while above this scale the signal from satellite lrgs paired with satellite @xmath0 galaxies takes over until @xmath163 ( comoving ) , where the two - halo pairs start to dominate .",
    "we show below that the variation with scales in the contributing components is the key to understanding the scale dependence of the luminosity - dependent cross - clustering . in the one - halo term",
    ", the signal from central lrgs mainly comes from halos of mass a few times @xmath2 to @xmath124 , while the signal from satellite lrgs is from halos of @xmath164 , where the lrg occupation number is a few .",
    "although the occupation numbers of lrgs and @xmath0 galaxies keep rising toward higher halo mass , more massive halos are too rare to make a significant contribution to the cross - correlation signal .      for the lrg@xmath0 cross - correlation , @xcite find a strong dependence on lrg luminosity . the clustering amplitude becomes higher for more luminous lrgs and",
    "varies by a factor of up to four over a factor of four in lrg luminosity ( see their fig .  2 ) .",
    "furthermore , the clustering amplitude increases more strongly with luminosity at smaller scales .",
    "we now show that these complex trends can be largely explained by the hod results described above .",
    "we note that the hod results are based on lrgs with luminosity @xmath165 , and while the lrg@xmath0 cross - correlation in @xcite is measured up to an lrg luminosity of @xmath166 , we focus on the @xmath165 results .",
    "we emphasize that we do not intend to explain the data points for @xmath167 , for which we extrapolate our results .",
    "our purpose here is to give a qualitative interpretation of the scale - dependent luminosity dependence of the cross - correlation between lrgs and @xmath0 galaxies .    from our modeling results ,",
    "the hod for lrgs in narrow luminosity bins can be readily constructed , similar to what we do for the @xmath30 sample .",
    "we do not refit auto - correlation functions of different lrg samples ; rather , we apply the value of @xmath55 and the scaling @xmath128 derived from the faint and bright luminosity - threshold samples and interpolate ( or extrapolate ) the satellite occupation function from these samples .",
    "figure  [ fig : crossl ] compares the predicted dependence of the cross - correlation on lrg luminosity to the observed one . the plotted quantity @xmath168 is the average excess number of @xmath0 galaxies around an lrg in an effective spherical volume of @xmath35 ( see eq .  [ [ eqn : delta ] ] ) .",
    "we have already shown ( fig .",
    "[ fig : crossnavg ] ) that our hod model reproduces the overall scale dependence of the cross - correlation accurately .",
    "figure  [ fig : crossl ] shows that the model also captures the trend of stronger luminosity dependence at smaller scales . since the prediction is mostly based on modeling lrgs in the luminosity range of 24 @xmath0 , it becomes less accurate at higher luminosities , where it is essentially an extrapolation .",
    "close inspection of the observed points shows that , at the smallest scales , the clustering amplitude rises steeply and steadily from @xmath169 to @xmath170 ; while on larger scales , the luminosity dependence in the @xmath171 ",
    "@xmath172 range is relatively flat , before steepening at higher luminosities .",
    "in addition , the overall luminosity dependence is weaker at larger scales .",
    "an intuitive understanding of these features can be built from our hod modeling results .    at very small scales , over all the lrg luminosity range , the cross - correlation signal is dominated by _",
    "central _ lrg paired with satellite @xmath0 galaxies .",
    "the thick dotted curves in figure  [ fig : crossl ] show this component from the model .",
    "the slope of this component is estimated as follows . approximating the mean occupation function of central lrgs in a narrow luminosity bin as a dirac-@xmath173 function ,",
    "the two - point cross - correlation function at a separation @xmath19 between @xmath0 galaxies and lrgs is simply proportional to the pair number @xmath174 , where @xmath175 is the mean occupation function of @xmath0 galaxies in halos of mass @xmath8 and @xmath176 is the fraction of @xmath0 galaxies located at a radius @xmath19 from the central lrg in halos of mass @xmath8 .",

    "most satellite - satellite pairs come from halos of a narrow mass range . as the luminosity in consideration increases , the occupation number of satellite lrgs at this halo mass decreases , leading to a decreasing contribution to the clustering amplitude from satellite - satellite pairs .",
    "the opposing dependences of clustering contributions from central lrgs and satellite lrgs on luminosity flattens the overall luminosity dependence at the low luminosity end , a feature seen in the observed clustering .    on much larger scales ( e.g. , 4@xmath11 ) ,",
    "the two - halo pairs dominate the cross - correlation between lrgs and @xmath0 galaxies , and the signal is proportional to the large - scale bias factor of lrgs . if the lrg bias factor is approximated by the halo bias factor , the luminosity - dependent clustering simply reflects the dependence of the halo bias factor on the halo mass .",
    "around @xmath191 , the halo bias factor can be approximated by a power law with index @xmath192 0.30.4 .",
    "this , together with the relation between central luminosity and halo mass @xmath193 ( @xmath194 ) , gives a luminosity dependence of the cross - clustering following roughly as @xmath195 , which agrees well with the observed trend .",
    "in modeling the lrg-@xmath0 cross - correlation , we make the assumption that there is no correlation between the occupation numbers of lrgs and @xmath0 galaxies inside the same halo . loosing this assumption would lead to changes in the contributions from one - halo central - satellite and satellite - satellite pairs .",
    "these changes would be at the level of fine details , and the above picture of the interplay among the three components for interpreting the scale - dependent luminosity dependence of the cross - correlation would remain valid .",
    "we have modeled the two - point auto - correlation functions of lrgs and the two - point cross - correlation functions between lrgs and @xmath0 galaxies in the sdss , within the hod framework , obtaining results on the mean relation between central lrg luminosity and halo mass , the dispersion about this relation , the slope and amplitude of the satellite occupation function , and the abundance of @xmath0 galaxies in massive halos .",
    "the continuous rise toward small scales of two - point auto - correlation functions of lrgs implies that not all lrgs are the bright central galaxies in galaxy groups or clusters ; a fraction of lrgs must be satellites to produce small scale , one - halo pairs .",

    "a similar drop is seen for the brightest sample ( @xmath198 ) in @xcite , which has a mean redshift @xmath199 .",

    "combining their hod modeling results with ours for lrgs at @xmath27 , we find that the value of @xmath50 is in the range of 0.40.5 over a larger range of lrg luminosity . from a study of the halo occupation statistics of galaxies using galaxy groups identified in the two degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; @xcite ) ,",
    "@xcite infer a @xmath4@xmath8 relation that is well described by a broken power law with @xmath216 2/3 and 1/4 below and above @xmath83 , respectively .",
    "the inferred @xmath4@xmath8 relation by @xcite from matching the luminosity function from the 2dfgrs with the theoretical subhalo mass function has a similar high - mass slope @xmath218 .",

    "@xcite is also about 0.3 .",
    "the value we obtain at the high - mass end from modeling the lrg clustering differs significantly from these results .",
    "it is interesting to see whether such a difference can be explained by the difference in the galaxy samples .",
    "the 2dfgrs luminosity is in the @xmath221 band , while we use the sdss @xmath17-band luminosity .",
    "since the wavelength coverages of these two bands are close , it seems unlikely that the band difference can cause the apparent discrepancy . the other thing",
    "to notice is that the 2dfgrs galaxies and the sdss main galaxies have a mean redshift @xmath222 and the lrg galaxies in our analysis are located around redshift 0.3 .",
    "could the discrepancy indicate an evolution effect over the intervening @xmath122 billion years ?",
    "through fitting restframe @xmath223-band galaxy luminosity functions at different redshifts using a clf approach , @xcite finds that the data are compatible with a halo - mass - dependent central galaxy luminosity evolution , with the high mass slope @xmath50 increasing with redshift .",
    "the fitting results of @xcite imply that @xmath50 could be as high as 0.5 at @xmath27 , close to our inferred value .",
    "if we take the inferred values of @xmath50 at @xmath27 from our analysis and at @xmath224 from the 2dfgrs studies at face value , they indicate that the luminosity evolution of central bright galaxies depends on halo mass in the sense that either galaxies in more massive halos fade more or the fraction of stars that were assembled into central galaxies from mergers between @xmath27 and @xmath225 is smaller in more massive halos .",
    "@xcite s study of the properties of early - type galaxies in the sdss as a function of local environment and redshift suggests that star formation in early - type galaxies happens earlier in dense regions and lasts over a shorter time - scale , which implies that central galaxies in more massive halos on average experience star formation at an earlier epoch .",
    "since younger stellar populations fade faster than older ones , this seems to rule out the possibility that luminosity of central galaxies in more massive halos fades more between @xmath27 and @xmath224 .",
    "we are left with the possibility that mergers in more massive halos are less efficient in adding stars to the central galaxies , which appears to be consistent with our finding of the drop of @xmath146 and its interpretation based on the competition between accretion and destruction as a function of halo mass .",
    "this is also in line with the results of lrg evolution in @xcite from hod modeling of their clustering from @xmath226 to @xmath227 in the noao deep wide - field survey .",
    "since lrgs naturally separate out massive halos , our hod modeling of the two - point cross - correlation functions between lrgs and @xmath0 galaxies circumvents the usual challenge in constraining the hod of @xmath0 galaxies in massive halos from their two - point auto - correlation function .",
    "we show that the cross - correlation data are consistent with the case where the distribution of @xmath0 galaxies inside massive halos roughly follows that of the matter at distances greater than @xmath228 and that the mean number of @xmath0 galaxies scales with halo mass as @xmath6 .",
    "the slope of the mean occupation function is steeper than what is found for @xmath70 galaxies , which is @xmath229 .",
    "there may not be inconsistency between the results .",
    "the constraint for the slope for @xmath70 galaxies from auto - correlation function is not sensitive to the occupation in very massive halos , while here from cross - correlation with lrgs , we have a better constraint on the @xmath0 occupation function in massive halos . on the other hand , the selection of @xmath0 galaxies and its redshift dependence",
    "make it hard to do a precise comparison between results at @xmath70 and at @xmath27 .",
    "the luminosity dependence of the lrg@xmath0 galaxy cross correlation depends on scale in a rather complex way @xcite . by separating contributions from pairs of @xmath0 galaxies with central and satellite lrgs in common halos and in different halos ,",
    "our hod modeling results explain these trends , in a relatively transparent way . at a fixed scale ,",
    "the luminosity dependence in the cross correlation reflects the luminosity - dependent hod of lrgs . as the scale in consideration changes , the relative contributions of the one - halo central - satellite , the one - halo satellite - satellite , and the two - halo lrg-@xmath0 pairs to the cross - correlation function vary , which leads to the scale - dependent luminosity dependence of the cross correlation .",
    "our lrg modeling results establish the relation between massive galaxies and dark matter halos at @xmath27 , which itself provides useful tests to models of formation of massive galaxies .",
    "@xcite present predictions for properties of lrgs in semi - analytic galaxy formation models .",
    "they show that the @xcite model , which is based on the millennium simulation @xcite , predicts a @xmath230 lrg luminosity function that is in good agreement with the observation , although it fails at @xmath231 .",
    "compared to the measurement , the @xcite model seems to predict the @xmath230 lrg two - point correlation function remarkably well on both small and large scales ( see their fig.13 ) .",
    "however , the lrg hod predicted in this model differs significantly from our modeling results presented in this paper : ( a ) in the @xcite model , lrgs in the fainter sample can reside in halos of @xmath232 ( with mean occupation number of @xmath120.01 ) , much lower than the mass scale we infer ; ( b ) the mass of halos that can on average host one lrg is about @xmath233 , higher than what we find ( see fig.11 in @xcite and fig.16 in @xcite ) ; ( c ) the probability distribution of lrg host halo masses is broad ( see fig.16 in @xcite ) , ranging from @xmath232 to @xmath155 , rather than narrowly peaked around a few times @xmath83 as we find ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wp_lrg]@xmath234 ) .",
    "does the discrepancy between the theoretically predicted hod and our observationally inferred hod imply that our hod parameterization is not generic enough to model lrg clustering ? to investigate the problem , we modify the five - parameter hod model ( appendix  [ sec : appendixb ] ) to mimic the shape of the mean occupation function predicted in @xcite model .",
    "the parameterization for the satellite mean occupation function remains unchanged ( with three parameters ) . for the central galaxy occupation function , we model it as a linear ( in logarithmic space ) ramp going from @xmath235 at @xmath130 to unity at @xmath236 and staying at unity for @xmath237 . in total , this parameterization has six free parameters . with the measured @xmath238 , we find that the best - fit hod from this six - parameter model ( not shown in figure  [ fig : samcmp]@xmath239 ) closely follows the result from the five - parameter model ( shown as thick curves in figure  [ fig : samcmp]@xmath239 ) .",
    "therefore , change in the hod parameterization does not solve the discrepancy and the five - parameter model is not inadequate in modeling lrg clustering .",
    "a close look at figure  13 in @xcite shows that the predicted two - point correlation function does not match the data perfectly  it is @xmath1215% higher on scales of 0.12@xmath11 and @xmath240 lower on scales larger than 2@xmath11 ( note that the vertical range of the plot is over eight orders of magnitude ) .",
    "we therefore modify the amplitude of the observed @xmath238 data points to mimic the predicted correlation function and perform an hod fit with the six - parameter model ( by adopting the predicted number density , which is 10% lower than the observed one ) .",
    "the results on the mean occupation functions are shown in panel ( @xmath239 ) of figure  [ fig : samcmp ] as thin curves .",
    "note that the shaded region represents the @xmath241 envelopes and the linear ramp for the central galaxy mean occupation number ( thin dashed curves ) has not reached unity at the highest mass in the plot .",
    "the mean occupation function can extend to halos of mass as low as @xmath242 and reaches unity around @xmath243 , which appears to be approximately consistent with the prediction of the @xcite model . from the above investigations ,",
    "we conclude that the discrepancy between the theoretically predicted lrg hod and the observationally inferred lrg hod reflects the imperfection of the semi - analytic galaxy formation model  the @xmath244 discrepancies with observed clustering are real and physically significant  rather than limitations in our hod parameterization .",
    "the results suggest that the mechanism of turning blue galaxies to red in the semi - analytic model is too efficient in halos of a few times @xmath232 and not efficient enough in more massive halos .",
    "our hod modeling results thus provide important tests to galaxy formation theory .    in combination with passive evolution of lrgs and a halo merger history ( e.g. , @xcite ) ,",
    "our modeling results can be used to predict the hod of lrgs and the clustering of lrgs at lower or slightly higher redshifts .",
    "supplemented with corresponding observations at these redshifts , we would be able to test our understanding of the formation and evolution of massive galaxies .",
    "constraints on the hod of lrgs are also useful for cosmological parameter investigations based on lrg clustering . for example , the most precise measurements of the large scale galaxy power spectrum have come from the sdss lrg sample ( @xcite ) , and the principal limitation in interpreting these measurements is the uncertain level of scale - dependent bias between galaxy and matter power spectra in the mildly non - linear regime . with hod constraints like those derived here",

    "[ fig : appendixa ]    departures of the galaxy two - point correlation function from a pure power law have been observed for both low and high redshift galaxies ( @xcite ) . in the two luminosity - threshold lrg samples studied in this paper , the departures are also clearly seen , shown as an upturn in the two - point correlation function at small scales ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "such departures have been nicely explained by the hod model as the transition from a regime dominated by one - halo pairs on small scales to that dominated by two - halo pairs on large scales @xcite .",
    "the strength of the departures of the galaxy two - point correlation function from a pure power law is closely related to the amplitude of the one - halo term , which itself depends on the scatter in the occupation number and the halo mass function ( @xcite ) .",
    "it would be helpful to gain a better understanding of the key factor that determines the strength of the departures .    for luminosity - threshold samples ,",
    "there are two mass scales , the characteristic minimum mass @xmath130 of halos that host central galaxies above the luminosity threshold and the mass scale @xmath131 of halos that on average host one satellite galaxy above the luminosity threshold .",
    "an additional mass scale is the nonlinear mass @xmath245 , marking a transition in the halo abundance from a power - law form to an exponential cutoff at high mass .",
    "we can thus identify two ratios that can shape the one - halo term : @xmath146 and @xmath246 .",
    "the @xmath146 ratio affects the shape of the galaxy occupation functions and tells us how quickly the transition from sub - poisson to poisson scatter occurs when going to higher halo masses . a smaller @xmath146 increases the importance of one - halo pairs by increasing the satellite fraction and thus results in a higher amplitude of the one - halo term .",
    "the @xmath246 ratio determines which part of the halo mass function the galaxy sample probes .",
    "the slope of the one - halo term reflects the drop of the halo mass function toward high masses . for a galaxy sample that probes the exponential tail of the halo mass function ( @xmath247 ) ,",
    "we expect a steep drop in the one - halo term and thus a sharp upturn around the one - halo to two - halo transition scale .    to figure out the relative importance of @xmath146 and @xmath246 on the departures from a power law in the galaxy two point correlation function , we calculate the predicted correlation functions on a @xmath248 grid of @xmath146 and @xmath246 , as shown in figure  [ fig : appendixa ] . in each panel ,",

    "the satellite - satellite pair contributions are similar at a fixed @xmath146 , since @xmath65 is assumed to be proportional to halo mass . in a massive halo of fixed mass",
    ", however , the contribution of central - satellite pairs relative to satellite - satellite pairs is larger for a higher @xmath246 sample because of its low satellite occupation number .",
    "this leads to a larger slope across the central - satellite and satellite - satellite contributions for a higher @xmath249 sample , thus a steeper upturn in the correlation function . in more detail",
    ", the slope across the central - satellite and satellite - satellite contributions should depend on the @xmath131 mass scale , but @xmath146 should not vary by an extremely large factor at least for a threshold galaxy sample .",
    "so a dependence on @xmath131 can be translated to that on @xmath246 . when probing the exponential tail of the halo mass function for observed galaxy samples , we expect a steeper slope in both the central - satellite and satellite - satellite one - halo terms .",
    "this in turn leads to a more prominent rise at small scales .    from the results , we conclude that overall the @xmath246 ratio plays a much more important role than @xmath146 in driving departures from a power law in galaxy two - point correlation functions",
    "that is , a steeper drop in the halo mass function is translated to a steeper radial cutoff in the one - halo term , leading to a stronger inflection where the one - halo and two - halo term join .",
    "this explains why the departure is stronger for more luminous galaxy samples ( e.g. , @xcite ) that probe the high mass end of the halo mass function .",
    "this also explains why the departures are more prominent at higher redshifts ( e.g. , @xcite )  the fast drop of the nonlinear mass @xmath245 toward high redshift makes the observed ( bright ) galaxies more likely to probe the exponential tail of the halo mass function .",
    "a more detailed theoretical investigation of the departure from a power law in the two - point correlation function of galaxies and its dependence on galaxy properties will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the lrg clustering modeling in the main text assumes a flexible hod parameterization , which reveals details of the constraining power of the two - point correlation functions on the hod . in general , the hods for luminosity - threshold samples predicted by galaxy formation models can be well described by a less flexible ( i.e. , more restricted ) parametric form .",

    "we perform an mcmc run for each lrg sample under each cosmological model and obtain the marginalized distribution for each of the five hod parameters .    in general , for a higher @xmath46 , the nonlinear mass increases and there are more high mass halos .",
    "to conserve the galaxy number density , the cutoff mass scale @xmath130 needs to increase .",
    "the increase in @xmath130 turns out to be slower than that in @xmath245 , which leads to a lower halo bias that is necessary to maintain the large scale clustering of galaxies ( i.e. , the square of @xmath261 ) .",

    "<S> we perform halo occupation distribution ( hod ) modeling to interpret small - scale and intermediate - scale clustering of 35,000 luminous early - type galaxies and their cross - correlation with a reference imaging sample of normal @xmath0 galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey . </S>",
    "<S> the modeling results show that most of these luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) are central galaxies residing in massive halos of typical mass @xmath1 a few times @xmath2 to @xmath3 , while a few percent of them have to be satellites within halos in order to produce the strong auto - correlations exhibited on smaller scales . </S>",
    "<S> the mean luminosity @xmath4 of central lrgs increases with the host halo mass , with a rough scaling relation of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the halo mass required to host on average one satellite lrg above a luminosity threshold is found to be about 10 times higher than that required to host a central lrg above the same threshold . </S>",
    "<S> we find that in massive halos the distribution of @xmath0 galaxies roughly follows that of the dark matter and their mean occupation number scales with halo mass as @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the hod modeling results also allows for an intuitive understanding of the scale - dependent luminosity dependence of the cross - correlation between lrgs and @xmath0 galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> constraints on the lrg hod provide tests to models of formation and evolution of massive galaxies , and they are also useful for cosmological parameter investigations . in one of the appendices , we provide lrg hod parameters with dependence on cosmology inferred from modeling the two - point auto - correlation functions of lrgs . </S>"
