    "in the past decade it has become clear that the majority of galaxies have likely had one or more brief active periods , shifting our view of astrophysical black holes ( bhs ) from the role of exotic phenomena to fundamental ingredients of cosmic structures .",
    "the question of when and under which physical conditions the active galactic nuclei ( agn ) activate is important for understanding not only the origin and evolution of bhs but also the origin and evolution of galaxies .    the clustering analysis can powerfully test theoretical model predictions and address which physical processes trigger agn activity . in the framework of the cold dark matter structure formation ( cdm )",
    ", the spatial distribution of agn in the universe ( described by the correlation function , cf ) can be related to how agn are biased with respect to the underlying matter distribution and to the typical mass of dark matter halos ( dmhs ) in which they reside .",
    "there have been several studies of the bias evolution of optical quasars with redshift , based on survey such as 2qz and sdss @xcite .",
    "all the previous studies infer the picture that the quasar bias evolves with redshift following a constant mass evolution in the range log@xmath11 [ ] @xmath12 , i.e. halo masses similar to group scales , where the combination of low velocity dispersion and moderate galaxy space density yields to the highest probability of a close encounter @xcite .",
    "models of major mergers between gas - rich galaxies appear to naturally produce many observed properties of quasars , such as the shape and the evolution of the quasar luminosity function and the large - scale quasar clustering as a function of luminosity and redshift @xcite , supporting the scenario in which major mergers dominate the bright quasar populations . on the other hand ,",
    "the majority of the results on the clustering of x - ray selected agn , suggest a picture where moderate - luminosity agn live in massive dmhs ( @xmath13 [ ] @xmath14 ) up to @xmath15 @xcite , i.e. x - ray selected agn samples appear to cluster more strongly than luminous quasars ( see * ? ? ? * for a review on the argument ) .",
    "the reason for this is not completely clear , but several studies argued that this large bias and dmh masses could suggest a different agn triggering mechanism with respect to bright quasars characterized by galaxy merger - induced fueling .",
    "several studies on the morphology of the agn host galaxies have demonstrated that major mergers of galaxies are not likely to be the single dominant mechanism responsible for triggering agn activity at low ( @xmath16 ) @xcite and high redshift ( @xmath17 2 ) @xcite .",
    "the theoretical understanding of galaxy clustering and bias factor has been greatly enhanced through the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) framework . in this framework ,",
    "the virialised dmh with typical overdensities of @xmath18 ( defined w.r.t .",
    "the mean density ) are described in terms of the probability @xmath19 of a halo of given mass @xmath20 of having @xmath21 galaxies .",
    "a simple way to model the complicated shape of @xmath22 is by assuming the existence of two separate galaxy populations within halos , central and satellite galaxies .",
    "this method has been used extensively to interpret galaxy cfs @xcite to constrain how various galaxy samples are distributed among dmh as well as whether these galaxies occupy the centers of the dmhs or are satellite galaxies @xcite .",
    "these two populations can be modeled with an hod described by a step function above a halo mass limit for central galaxies , and a power - law for satellite galaxies .",
    "similarly , the problem of discussing the abundance and spatial distribution of agn can be reduced to studying how they populate their host halos .",
    "in fact the observed departure of the agn cf from a power law on small scales ( 1 - 2 ) can be physically interpreted in the language of the halo model , as the transition between two scales - from small scales lying within the dmhs ( 1-halo term ) to those larger than the halo ( 2-halo term ) .",
    "the 1-halo term constrains the hod of satellite agn and gives us the average profile of pairs of agn in groups and clusters of galaxies .",
    "the 2-halo term reflects the large - scale agn bias driven by the typical mass of the hosting halos .",
    "due to the low number density of agn , there have been few results in the literature studying the agn correlation function using hod modeling .",
    "previous works of @xcite at @xmath23 and @xcite at @xmath24 on qso using the hod modeling found that @xmath2525% and @xmath2610% of their qsos , respectively , are satellites .",
    "@xcite described for the first time the shape of the hod of x - ray selected agn . by using the cross correlation function of rosat - rass agn with sdss galaxies , they modelled the mean agn occupation of dmhs suggesting that the satellite agn fraction increases slow ( or may even decrease ) with @xmath6 , in contrast with the satellite hod of luminosity - limited samples of galaxies .",
    "cosmological hydrodynamic simulations have been performed in @xcite to study the mean occupation function of low - luminosity agn as function of redshift and luminosity .",
    "they used a softened step function for the central component plus a rolling - off power - law for the satellite component with @xmath27 depending on the redshift and agn luminosity .",
    "their results suggest a strong evolution of the agn occupancy in the redshift range @xmath28 estimated at three different luminosities @xmath29 s@xmath30erg .",
    "@xcite modelled the hod of sdss quasars at @xmath31 following this parametrization .",
    "they found that the satellite occupation becomes significant at mass @xmath32 , i.e. only the most massive halos host multiple quasars at this redshift and only a small satellite fraction ( @xmath33 ) of sdss quasars is required to fit the clustering signal at small scales .",
    "moreover , they measured that the quasars hod steepens considerably going from z=1.4 to 3.2 over halo mass scales @xmath34 and that the characteristic halo mass increases with z for central quasars . despite the diverse methods for studying the hod , counting the number of agn within galaxy groups can constrain quite directly the average agn number within a halo as a function of halo mass . the total mass of galaxy groups",
    "can be estimated via gravitational lensing and the distribution of agn within halos can be investigated in groups by means of the distribution of the agn host galaxies . separating the contribution to the occupation of halos from agn in satellite or central galaxies can advance our understanding of the co - evolution agn / galaxy and is related to the mechanism of agn activation . on the other hand ,",
    "the cross - correlation ( ccf ) of agn with galaxy groups provides additional information about how galaxies and bh co - evolve in dense environments .",
    "in fact the physical processes that drive galaxy evolution , such as the available cold gas to fuel star formation and the bh growth , are substantially different in groups and clusters compared to the field .",

    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite showed that low - luminosity agn could be triggered in more common nonmerger events , like stochastic encounters of the black holes and molecular clouds , tidal disruption or disk instability .",

    "a decreasing agn fraction with the halo mass is consistent with previous observations that the agn fraction is smaller in clusters than in groups in the nearby universe .    in order to fully understand the growth history of smbhs as well as the physical processes responsible for the agn activity we need to explore the agn hod at different redshifts , luminosities , and agn types .",
    "the luminosity distribution of agn that reside in halos of a given mass provides a tool to examine the distribution of halo mass for a given luminosity and study luminosity dependent clustering . while this formalism has been widely used in modelling galaxy clustering , it is still not applicable to agn .",

    "<S> we present the first direct measurement of the mean halo occupation distribution ( hod ) of x - ray selected agn in the cosmos field at @xmath0 , based on the association of 41 xmm and 17 c - cosmos agn with member galaxies of 189 x - ray detected galaxy groups from xmm and _ chandra _ data . </S>",
    "<S> we model the mean agn occupation in the halo mass range @xmath1 = 13- 14.5 $ ] with a rolling - off power - law with the best fit index @xmath2 and normalization parameter @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we find the mean hod of agn among central galaxies to be modelled by a softened step function at log@xmath4log@xmath5 while for the satellite agn hod we find a preference for an increasing agn fraction with @xmath6 suggesting that the average number of agn in satellite galaxies grows slower ( @xmath7 ) than the linear proportion ( @xmath8 ) observed for the satellite hod of samples of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we present an estimate of the projected auto correlation function ( acf ) of galaxy groups over the range of @xmath9 0.1 - 40 at @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> we use the large - scale clustering signal to verify the agreement between the group bias estimated by using the observed galaxy groups acf and the value derived from the group mass estimates . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a measurement of the projected agn - galaxy group cross - correlation function , excluding from the analysis agn that are within galaxy groups and we model the 2-halo term of the clustering signal with the mean agn hod based on our results . </S>"
