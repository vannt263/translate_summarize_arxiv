    "parametric oscillators for generating electromagnetic microwaves might be possible , based upon the idea that a moving mirror is like a moving piston that can perform work _ nonadiabatically _ on radiation contained within a cavity . above a certain threshold , the parametric action of the moving mirror will exponentially amplify this radiation until it can become a large - amplitude , classical wave .",
    "an essential component for such a parametric oscillator is a high - q superconducting ( sc ) resonator , which can be formed by a fixed , spherical curved sc mirror in conjunction with a moving , flat sc  mirror ( see figure 1 ) .    to understand how the proposed parametric oscillator works ,",
    "let us imagine performing a thought experiment in which some weak , on - resonance , seed  microwave radiation from an outside microwave source , is injected backwards through the output hole of the curved sc mirror of figure 1 , into the volume of the cavity between the curved and flat mirrors .",
    "thus the sc resonator can be filled with seed  radiation , exciting it into its fundamental tm@xmath0 eigenmode . as a result",
    ", there will appear a longitudinal electric field @xmath3 at the surface of the sc flat mirror that will be oscillating at the tm@xmath0 eigenmode frequency , i.e. , at a microwave frequency ( see appendix a ) .",
    "next , imagine that the flat sc mirror consists of a thin sc film sputtered onto the left side of a thin , light , flexible diaphragm ( e.g. , the pellicle mirror to be introduced later in figure 4 ) , which is sufficiently thin so that this diaphragm can easily be driven into mechanical motion .",
    "moreover , imagine that this film is electrostatically charged with a dc charge @xmath4 .",
    "then the longitudinal electric field @xmath3 at the surface of the sc film will lead to a force@xmath5oscillating at the @xmath6 microwave frequency as that of @xmath7 .",
    "note that ( [ f_z prop to e_z ] ) is a _ linear _ relationship between the force @xmath8 and the electric field @xmath9 . in this way",
    ", a force oscillating at a microwave frequency can be exerted upon the diaphragm parallel to the @xmath1 axis , and the flat sc mirror will be driven into simple harmonic motion at the same microwave frequency as that of the tm@xmath0 eigenmode of the sc resonator of figure 1 .",
    "now consider the opto - mechanical configuration sketched in figure 2 , in which a laser beam from the right is incident on a moving mirror ( e.g. , on the flat sc mirror of figure 1 with multilayer dielectric optical coatings deposited on its right side ) .",
    "when this moving optical mirror is combined with a fixed optical mirror in an optical fabry - perot - cavity configuration , there will arise a production of doppler sidebands , which can then be utilized either for the laser cooling of the moving mirror by means of a _ red - detuned _ laser tuned to the lower doppler sideband aspelmeyer josa b , or for the parametric oscillation of the moving mirror excited in an elastic mode at acoustical frequencies by means of a _ blue - detuned _ laser tuned to the upper doppler sideband @xcite . above the threshold for parametric oscillation of the moving mirror within the sc resonator of figure 1 , a signalwave would begin to build up , growing exponentially with time starting from the injected seed  microwave radiation . however , once parametric oscillation above threshold has occurred , one could turn off the source of the seedradiation .",
    "the sc resonator would then continue to oscillate as an autonomous source of the same microwaves as the seed  in the absence of the seed , just like the autonomous generation of microwave radiation by the original ammonia maser above its oscillation threshold gzt .",
    "for ease of understanding , consider the simplified opto - mechanical model for the parametric process shown in figure 2 , in which a moving mirror attached to a spring is coupled via radiation pressure to a strong pump  laser at frequency @xmath10 , a weak idler  light wave within an optical resonator at frequency @xmath11 , and a weak signal  wave in the sc resonator at frequency @xmath12 , which is being represented as a simple harmonic oscillator with a resonance frequency @xmath12 , such that@xmath13the energy for the oscillating fields at @xmath11 and @xmath12 comes from the energy supplied by the pump laser at @xmath10 .    in figure 2",
    ", we have replaced the hemiconfocal microwave resonator shown in figure 1 by a mass - and - spring model , in which the simple harmonic mechanical motion of the flat sc mirror of figure 1 driven in the presence of the charge @xmath4 by the longitudinal electric field @xmath14 parallel to the @xmath1 axis , is modeled by the simple harmonic motion of a mass attached via a spring to the fixed wall on the left side of figure 2 . the justification for using this mechanical model",
    "( see appendix b ) is that we have found that the fundamental eigenmode solution of the sc hemiconfocal microwave resonator , which is the gaussian - beam tm@xmath0 mode , possesses a longitudinal component @xmath3 of the electric field which has a nonvanishing component along the @xmath1 axis of the resonator acting on the electrostatic charge @xmath4  at the surface of the flat mirror of figure 1 .",
    "therefore there exists a longitudinal component of the force that drives the flat mirror back and forth into simple harmonic motion along the @xmath1 axis , whose motion can then be simulated by the mass - and - spring model of figure 2 .",
    "furthermore , we shall model , by means of a single , simplified fabry - perot structure on the right side of figure 2 , a double  optical fabry - perot resonator , which is depicted in more detail in figure 3 , whose purpose is to simultaneously resonate both the strong , incoming _ blue - detuned _ laser ( i.e. , the pump  laser ) and the weak , doppler red - shifted idler  light wave produced upon reflection from the moving mirror , but whose purpose is also to serve as a rejection filter to reject any undesirable doppler blue - shifted ( or anti - stokes ) light . later",
    ", we shall put all these pieces of the parametric oscillator system together in figure 4 .",
    "figure 3(a ) shows the detailed structure of the double  fabry - perot resonator , which consists of three equally spaced mirrors m1 , m2 , and m3 .",
    "suppose that m1 is the moving mirror of figure 2 ( or the pellicle mirror  of figure 4 ) .",
    "suppose further that at @xmath15 light initially fills the left half of the structure between m1 and m2 , but that there is initially no light in the right half between m2 and m3 . then after a period of time determined by the transmittivity of the middle mirror m2",
    ", light will leak from the left cavity to the right cavity , until light fills the right cavity .",
    "this results in a periodic sloshing back and forth of the light between the left and right halves of the structure at a frequency equal to the splitting frequency of the spectral doublet shown in figure 3(b ) .",
    "the pump  laser will be tuned into the resonance with the upper member of the spectral doublet ; the idler  wave to the lower member of this doublet .",
    "any small amount of noise at the idler frequency will lead to a radiation pressure force on the moving mirror m1 that will be modulated at the doublet splitting frequency , which can be chosen to be tuned into resonance with the sc microwave resonator frequency of figure 1 .",
    "this then can lead to a mutual , resonant reinforcement of the noise in the idler  and signal  modes that leads to exponential growth of both by parametric amplification , and possibly to oscillation above a certain threshold , as will be presently shown .",
    "an important feature of the doublefabry - perot is that it automatically rejects all doppler up - shifted , or anti - stokes ,  spectral components arising from the motion of the moving mirror towards the laser in figure 2 .",
    "such undesirable anti - stokes ,  or up - shifted , frequency components of the light can rob energy away from the desired stokes ,  down - shifted , frequency components , specifically , the idlerfrequency necessary for exponential parametric gain to occur . since the spectral doublet structure of figure 3(b ) does not have any resonance at the anti - stokes  frequency ,",
    "the double  fabry - perot will serve as a spectral rejection filter that prevents light from building up inside the resonator at any unwanted , doppler up - shifted frequencies .",
    "mode , and the optical mode on the right side of the pellicle is the tem@xmath16 mode . ]",
    "a practical implementation of the moving mirror  idea at the heart of the microwave parametric oscillator , is to evaporate a thin sc film onto a thin , flexible , low - mass pellicle ( with a thickness of around two microns @xcite ) stretched tautly over a circular wire frame in order to form a drumhead  with a low - frequency acoustical eigenmode whose mode pattern has a central maximum at the center of the pellicle . on the reverse side of the pellicle",
    ", one could then evaporate dielectric optical coatings to reflect both the strong pump  laser light beam , and the weak idler  light beam , for implementing the double  fabry - perot cavity for the pump  and idleroptical  beams , which is sketched in figure 3 .    in figure 4 ( which is not drawn to scale , since the diffraction of the microwave - frequency signal  gaussian",
    "beam will occur much more quickly than the diffraction of the optical - frequency pump and idler light beams ) , we put together all the pieces of the parametric oscillator system based on the pellicle mirror  idea .",
    "since microwave frequencies are very much higher than the acoustical frequencies of the pellicle drumhead , the motion of the central portion of the pellicle is essentially like that of a free body ( i.e. , a free mass ) being driven at microwave frequencies .",
    "one can understand the parametric amplification arising in this configuration as follows : when the pumplaser beam enters from the right into the double  optical fabry - perot system , the pellicle will act as if it were a piston that is being driven by the radiation pressure force which is varying at the beat note frequency between the strong pump  laser beam ( in blue ) , whose frequency is @xmath10 , and the weak idler  ( or stokes ) beam ( in red ) , whose frequency is @xmath11 , such that this beat note frequency equals the signal  frequency @xmath17 , which is the tm@xmath0 eigenmode resonance frequency of the left - hand - side microwave fabry - perot resonator . then during the parametric amplification process",
    ", one quantum of the pump wave will break up into one quantum of the signal wave plus one quantum of the idler of wave , satisfying the energy conservation relationship@xmath18where @xmath19 is one quantum of energy of the pump  mode , @xmath20 is one quantum of energy of the idler  mode , and @xmath21 is one quantum of energy of the signal  mode .",
    "the moving sc pellicle mirror , when it is viewed as if it were a moving piston , will do work on the seedmicrowaves contained inside the left fabry - perot as it moves nonadiabatically @xcite .",
    "hence the action of the moving pellicle will amplify this seedradiation , which will in turn amplify the motion of the pellicle when it is viewed as a moving optical mirror , because this motion will further amplify the strength of the stokes  doppler sideband of the incoming pump  laser beam , thus amplifying the strength of the idler  beam .",
    "this in turn increases the strength of the beat note in the radiation pressure force acting on the pellicle , which further increases the amplitude of the motion of the pellicle , etc .",
    ", in a feedback process . in this way , there will be a mutual reinforcement of the signal  wave and the idler  wave , so that an exponential growth of both waves ( above a certain threshold of oscillation ) will result , as in a traditional laser .",
    "for each quantum produced in the idler  mode , a quantum of the signal  mode will be produced as well , in agreement with the manley - rowe relations @xcite .",
    "we make a simple argument to estimate the threshold for parametric amplification of the pellicle mirror parametric oscillator shown in figure 4 .",
    "let us assume that the microwave cavity on the left side of the parametric amplifier can be modeled as a mirror with a spring attached to a fixed wall ( see figure 2 ) so that it forms a simple harmonic oscillator with resonant frequency @xmath12 , effective mass @xmath22 , and quality factor @xmath23 .",
    "the right half of the parametric oscillator is regarded as a double  optical fabry - perot resonator with two resonances at @xmath11 and @xmath10 .",
    "the transmission of this double  fabry - perot has been studied in @xcite and is illustrated in figure 5 .",
    "note that the splitting between the double peaks depends on the values of the reflection coefficients .",
    "we require that @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 corresponds to reflection coefficient of the two end mirrors , and @xmath27 to the middle mirror in figure 3(a ) .",
    "furthermore , the purpose of the double  fabry - perot is to allow for the selection of the two desired optical modes @xmath11 and @xmath28 , as already discussed . since the double  fabry - perot acts as a single fabry - perot with two closely spaced resonances , we treat the parametric amplifier as a single fabry - perot cavity with a harmonically moving end mirror as illustrated in figure 2 .     and the pumpmode @xmath29 .",
    "the difference frequency between pump  and idler  is resonant with the signal  frequency  @xmath30 .",
    "the anti - stokes  @xmath31 is off resonance and , hence suppressed . ]",
    "the fabry - perot with a harmonically moving end - mirror ( see appendix c ) yields the following equations of motion @xmath32where @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the cross sectional area of the resonator , @xmath35 is a slowly varying oscillator amplitude , @xmath36 is the round trip time between the two mirrors of figure 2 , @xmath37 is the slowly varying amplitude of the idler  mode , and @xmath38 , @xmath39 are the hwhm for the idler  and signal , respectively .",
    "the problem of a fabry - perot with a harmonically moving end - mirror has been solved in detail by @xcite .",

    "we can express this in terms of the outside laser power of the pump  beam ( @xmath48 ) by noting the circulating power inside ( @xmath49 ) the fabry - perot cavity for the pump  mode is to a good approximation @xmath50where @xmath51 is the finesse of the fabry - perot resonator , assuming a high reflection coefficient for its mirrors .",
    "solving for the outside pump  intensity gives the threshold condition for parametric amplification @xmath52where @xmath43 is the length of the fabry - perot , and @xmath53 is the speed of light .",
    "for estimates of the threshold we select a reflection coefficient luisnote0 @xmath54 for the two end mirrors , and @xmath55 for the middle mirror ( m2 of figure 3 ) .",
    "these values yield a spacing between the two peaks in figure 5 of @xmath56 ghz , which also corresponds to a finesse of @xmath57 , a @xmath58 for a 700 nm wavelength ; the quality factor of the signal  is assumed @xcite to be @xmath59 , @xmath60 cm , and @xmath22 is assumed to be a free mass luisnote2 on the order of @xmath61 mg . with these parameters",
    "we find a laser power threshold of @xmath62it is strongly noted that these estimates are based on the ideal model described above",
    ". however , it suffices as an order of magnitude estimate and shows that parametric amplification in such a scheme may be possible .",
    "furthermore , parametric amplification of acoustic modes has already been experimentally observed within fabry - perot cavities corbitt06,kippenberg05 .",
    "now suppose that one were to replace the optical double  fabry - perot system in figure 4 by a microwave double  all - superconducting fabry - perot system , so that the entire system becomes an all - microwave , all - superconducting resonator system .",
    "let us also replace the incoming laser pump  beam by an incoming microwave pump  beam coming in from the right , and let us then recalculate the pump threshold power needed for parametric oscillation .",
    "for the case of microwave resonators having lengths comparable to the microwave wavelength , the cavity finesse @xmath51 becomes comparable to the quality factor @xmath63 for the pump  resonator , so that now the estimate for the threshold power becomes@xmath64since the system is now an all - superconducting system , we shall assume that @xcite@xmath65again let us assume a mass @xmath22 of the pellicle mirror to be 2 mg , and a length @xmath43 of the resonator to be 1 cm , which corresponds to a signal  frequency @xmath12  of @xmath66 ghz , and a pumpfrequency @xmath10 of @xmath67 ghz , in the case of a degenerate parametric oscillator for which @xmath68 .",
    "one concludes from ( [ microwave threshold power ] ) that@xmath69therefore only microwatt - scale pumpthreshold powers are needed for parametric oscillation for an all - microwave , all - superconducting resonator system .",
    "this is clearly a feasible experiment to perform .",
    "here we examine in detail the properties of the fundamental gaussian - beam mode of the electromagnetic hemiconfocal resonator sketched in figure 1 , following the methodology of the analysis of ince - gaussian beams introduced in reference @xcite .    in order to satisfy the conducting boundary conditions at the sc surface of the flat mirror located at @xmath70 in figure 1 , we seek solutions of the vectorized paraxial wave equation @xcite which result in a longitudinal electric field vector @xmath71 satisfying the conducting boundary conditions at the surface of this mirror , which in turn leads to a _ longitudinal _ component of the electrical force on the charges located at the surface of the mirror .",
    "the analysis begins with the maxwell s equations for electromagnetic fields _ in vacuo _",
    "@xcite @xmath72@xmath73@xmath74@xmath75assuming that all fields have the same complex exponential time dependence @xmath76 these equations become@xmath77@xmath78@xmath79@xmath80taking the curl of the first maxwell equation ( [ faraday ] ) , and using the second maxwell equation ( [ maxwell displacement ] ) , one gets@xmath81using the vector identity@xmath82and using the fact that in the vacuum , @xmath83 ( i.e. , that there are no charges present within the volume of the resonator ) , one arrives at the helmholtz equation for the electric field@xmath84where@xmath85is the vacuum wavenumber of the em wave inside the fabry - perot resonator shown in figure 1 , with @xmath86 being the vacuum speed of light .",
    "likewise , one arrives at the helmholtz equation for the magnetic field@xmath87    note that the fabry - perot resonator configuration of figure 1 has a dominant axis of propagation , namely , the @xmath1 axis .",
    "this suggests that a paraxial wave approximation for the @xmath1 component of the electric field might be useful here .",
    "an important reason for singling out the @xmath1 component of the electric field for the helmholtz equation is that the boundary conditions at the flat sc mirror require that the longitudinal ( or normal )  component of the electric field does not vanish at the surface of the mirror , but that the transverse ( or tangential ) components of the electric field must vanish at this conducting ( or superconducting ) boundary .",
    "this boundary condition singles out a transverse magnetic mode as the fundamental mode of the resonator .",
    "let us choose the surface of the flat mirror to coincide with the @xmath70 plane . then from the above conducting boundary conditions",
    ", we expect that the longitudinal component @xmath88 is a maximum at @xmath70 , and also at @xmath89 at the conducting surface of the curved mirror , but that the transverse components of the electric field vanish at these surfaces .",
    "we therefore seek solutions of the @xmath1 component of the the electric field from helmholtz equation ( [ helmholtz equation for e vector ] ) , i.e. , @xmath90that satisfy these boundary conditions . from these solutions for @xmath88 , we can derive the transverse components of the electric and magnetic fields of the modes of the resonator , in a procedure similar to finding the fields of the transverse magnetic ( tm ) modes of a microwave resonator @xcite .",
    "in other words , the conducting boundary conditions for the configuration of mirrors shown in figure 1 demand that the @xmath1 component of the magnetic field must be zero everywhere on the surfaces of the mirrors , i.e.,@xmath91a condition that is also required by the meissner effect in sc s .",
    "it is then natural to try as a solution of the helmholtz equation ( [ z component helmholtz equation ] ) the following @xmath92 for the @xmath1 component of the electric field:@xmath93where @xmath94 is a constant , @xmath95 is a dimensionless factor with a complex amplitude that varies slowly with @xmath1 compared to the fast @xmath1 dependence of the factor @xmath96 , and  c.c . , \" as usual , is the complex conjugate of the previous term .",
    "we have chosen here the @xmath1 dependence to be that of a cosine rather than a sine function in order to satisfy the boundary condition that @xmath88 is maximum ( i.e. , an anti - node ) at @xmath70 .",
    "this leads to a standing - wave solution for the mode of the sc resonator .    therefore neglecting the second derivative of @xmath97 with respect to @xmath1 , which is assumed to be small compared to the first derivative with respect to @xmath1 , we arrive at the paraxial wave equation for the slowly varying amplitude @xmath98@xmath99where the transverse laplacian @xmath100 is@xmath101    note that the paraxial wave equation ( [ paraxial wave equation ] ) has the same mathematical form as the time - dependent schrdinger equation@xmath102except that the axial distance @xmath1 in the paraxial resonator problem has now been replaced by the time @xmath103 in the quantum mechanics problem . since we know that spreading gaussian wavepacket solutions are solutions to the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( [ time - dependent s.e . ] ) , we expect that analogous gaussian solutions will also be solutions to the paraxial wave equation ( [ paraxial wave equation ] ) .    for the fabry - perot resonator configuration of figure 1 , the procedure is to first solve the paraxial wave equation ( [ paraxial wave equation ] ) for @xmath104 after setting @xmath105 everywhere .",
