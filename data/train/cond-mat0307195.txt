    "inelastic neutron scattering experiments give important information on the anomalous properties of high-@xmath5 superconductors . among the results obtained with this experimental method",
    "is the detailed information on the magnetic susceptibility in yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 measured in wide ranges of hole concentrations and temperatures .",
    "@xcite these measurements revealed the sharp magnetic collective mode called the resonance peak .",
    "the peak first observed @xcite in the superconducting state of yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath6 was later also detected in the underdoped compounds , both in the superconducting and normal states .",
    "@xcite recently the resonance peak was also observed in bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath7 and tl@xmath0ba@xmath0cuo@xmath8 .",
    "@xcite    theoretical works devoted to the resonance peak were mainly concentrated at the overdoped region where the peak is observed in the superconducting state and disappears in the normal state .",
    "@xcite in refs .",
    "an interpretation of the resonance peak based on the itinerant magnetism approach was proposed .",
    "this approach which uses the lindhard function for the bare susceptibility @xmath9 and the random phase approximation relates the appearance of the peak to the disappearance or considerable decrease of @xmath10 in the frequency range @xmath11 with the opening of the @xmath12-wave @xcite or @xmath13-wave @xcite superconducting gaps @xmath14 . here",
    "@xmath15 is the antiferromagnetic wave vector . in this frequency range",
    "the peak arises due to the logarithmic divergence in @xmath16 which originates from the jump @xcite in @xmath10 or due to the nesting of the bonding and antibonding fermi surfaces in the two - layer crystal .",
    "@xcite in the normal state , when the damping increases , the peak is smeared out . for the approaches of refs .",
    "the two - layer structure of yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 is of crucial importance for the appearance of the resonance peak .",
    "however , the recent observation @xcite of the peak in single - layer tl@xmath0ba@xmath0cuo@xmath8 indicates that an interaction between closely spaced cu - o layers is not the necessary condition .",
    "a single - layer system described by a modified @xmath13-@xmath17 hamiltonian was considered in ref .  .",
    "in that work the resonance peak appears also due to the vanishing damping of spin excitations and a real part of the spin excitation frequency stems from the fermion bubble .",
    "a qualitatively different approach was suggested in ref .",
    "where the existence of a well - defined branch of spin excitations which exists even in the absence of mobile carriers was postulated near the @xmath18 point ( @xmath19 ) of the brillouin zone . in this scenario",
    "the resonance peak is related to the excitation with @xmath19 of this branch . as in ref .",
    ", here the peak is visible in the superconducting state due to the absence of the damping for @xmath20 and is smeared out in the normal state .",
    "this latter scenario seems to correspond most adequately to available experimental data on the resonance peak .",
    "as mentioned , it is observed also in underdoped yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 and in the superconducting state the peak varies continuously on passing from the underdoped to overdoped region .",
    "moreover , in the underdoped region the peak is also observed in the normal state and its frequency is nearly the same as in the superconducting state .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to search for a unified explanation for the peak which is applicable both for underdoped and overdoped regions , and  in the former region  for the normal and superconducting states . the existence of the excitation branch of localized cu spins is well established for the underdoped region .",
    "@xcite in this region it is quite reasonable to connect the resonance peak with these excitations .    in this paper",
    "we use the two - dimensional @xmath3-@xmath4 model to which the realistic three - band hubbard model of the cuo@xmath0 planes can be mapped in the case of a strong on - site coulomb repulsion .",
    "@xcite for the underdoped region the self - consistent solution of the @xmath3-@xmath4 model was obtained in ref .   with the use of mori s projection operator technique .",
    "we employ this result for the calculation of the magnetic susceptibility in the normal and superconducting states .",
    "the calculations reproduce correctly the frequency and momentum dependencies of the susceptibility and its evolution with doping and temperature in yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "this allows us to relate the resonance peak with the excitation branch of the localized cu spins and to identify the frequency of the peak with the size of the spin gap at the @xmath18 point . in the underdoped region , with increasing doping the peak frequency grows with the gap size and the peak intensity decreases , in agreement with experimental observations .",
    "@xcite moreover , the low - frequency shoulder observed @xcite in the susceptibility of superconducting crystals can be connected with a pronounced maximum which we find in the damping of the spin excitations .",
    "this maximum is caused by intense quasiparticle peaks in the hole spectral function for momenta near the fermi surface and by the nesting .",
    "the hamiltonian of the 2d @xmath3-@xmath4 model reads @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the hole annihilation operator , * n * and * m * label sites of the square lattice , @xmath23 is the spin projection , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are site states corresponding to the absence and presence of a hole on the site",

    "the hole spectrum of the @xmath3-@xmath4 model becomes similar to that used in ref .   and",
    "the analogous outcome can be expected here .",
    "in contrast to the underdoped region , in the overdoped case the frequency of the resonance peak decreases with doping which can be related to a finite damping of the spin excitations and to the decrease of the superconducting gap with doping in this range of concentrations . @xcite    in contrast to yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 where @xmath192 , in la@xmath193sr@xmath194cuo@xmath195 the value of @xmath196  mev is substantially smaller than @xmath144 which is supposed to be approximately the same as in the former crystal",
    ". this difference may be the reason for the absence of the resonance peak in overdoped la@xmath193sr@xmath194cuo@xmath195 .",
    "@xcite changes in the susceptibility observed @xcite in la@xmath197sr@xmath198cuo@xmath195 at the superconducting transition consist of some suppression of @xmath199 below the superconducting gap and an increase above it .",
    "the suppression can be connected with the decrease of the damping of the spin excitation accompanying the opening of the gap , while the increase of the signal above the gap is apparently a combined effect of the transfer of the carrier spectral weight above the gap and the nesting supposed @xcite for the fermi surface of this crystal .    in conclusion , we compared the magnetic susceptibility calculated in the @xmath3-@xmath4 model with the experimental data in the underdoped yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "it was demonstrated that the calculations reproduce correctly the frequency and momentum dependencies of the experimental susceptibility and its variation with doping and temperature in the normal and superconducting states .",
    "this allowed us to interpret the maximum in the frequency dependence ",
    "the resonance peak  as a manifestation of the excitation branch of localized cu spins and to relate the frequency of the maximum to the size of the spin gap .",
    "the low - frequency shoulder well resolved in the susceptibility of superconducting crystals was connected with a pronounced maximum in the damping of the spin excitations .",
    "this maximum is caused by intense quasiparticle peaks in the hole spectral function for momenta near the fermi surface and by the nesting .",
