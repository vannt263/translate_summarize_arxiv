    "the field also induces a change of the spin dynamics , as shown in figure [ figure - ins ] for @xmath70 $ ] . in this case",
    ", the applied field selects the @xmath4 domains with @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( among the 6 present in zero field ) .",
    "a signature of this domain selection in the excitation spectrum is the vanishing of additional acoustic branches stemming from zone centers , as can be seen on figure [ figure - ins ] when comparing the @xmath73 t with the zero field data for instance .    when the field is further increased , the spins are gradually tilted , before reaching the critical field @xmath68 .",
    "the latter manifests as a cusp in the intensity of certain bragg peaks , as shown in the diffraction measurements and the field induced magnetic structures in section [ lf ] .",
    "our inelastic measurements evidence that below @xmath68 the spectrum resembles the zero field spectrum , with regular spin waves , except that the spin gap increases , and that some intensity is lost when approaching @xmath68 .",

    "@xcite , see also ref . ) and calculates the spin dynamics in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) @xcite .",
    "the second one is a linear spin wave ( lsw ) calculation @xcite based on the spin 1/2 hamiltonian @xmath46 and on the parameters determined in ref .",
    "( see appendix  [ models ] ) .",
    "these two approaches reproduce successfully the experimental spectra as shown in figure [ figure - h0p25 t ] .",
    "nevertheless , in zero field , the spin gap is underestimated in the vcf model @xcite and ( as expected ) is zero in the lsw theory .",
    "in addition , while the qualitative behavior of the field dependence of the spin gap is well captured by both models , none is able to reproduce the strong increase of @xmath74 at intermediate fields , just before the saturation at @xmath68 ( see figure  [ figure - ins ] ) .",
    "this discrepancy suggests that some ingredients are missing in the hamiltonian to describe accurately the field behavior .",
    "accounting for additional interactions , such as multispin ones , may improve the agreement between models and experiments .",
    "in this section , we turn to the description of the phase diagram by focusing mainly on the  low field \" part , i.e. when the field is small enough not to tilt the magnetic moments with respect to their easy anisotropy plane .",
    "this region of the phase diagram has been little explored experimentally .",
    "anomalies have been reported in the isothermal magnetization curves below 0.1  t @xcite , which appear as maxima in the derivative of the magnetization with respect to the magnetic field @xmath81 , and indicate that field induced transitions may occur at low field .",

    "interestingly , for @xmath116 , while the same selection occurs at low field and just below @xmath115 , a new phase is predicted at intermediate fields .",

    "it is essentially stabilized in the field region where @xmath117 overcomes @xmath86 .",
    "the microscopic parameters estimated for er@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 place the system close to the boundary between these two regimes , with @xmath118 slightly larger than one , so that the existence of this intermediate phase is an open question at the moment .",
    "note however that when the temperature increases , the six - fold anisotropy @xmath86 of @xmath119 is reinforced by thermal fluctuations , so that the @xmath4 state is expected to be stable in the whole field range below @xmath115 .      to determine the changes in the magnetic structures corresponding to the anomalies",
    "reported at low field in the isothermal magnetization curves @xcite , and to test the above theoretical ideas , neutron diffraction measurements have been performed in the three directions of the applied field .",
    "the refinements obtained from the data collection give magnetic structures which derive from the zero field magnetic structures @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( see figure [ figure1 ] ) of the @xmath6 representation . depending on the strength and on the field direction , the magnetic moments are tilted with respect to the zero field structures , resulting in a non zero magnetic component along the applied field ( see appendix  [ app_h ] ) . they still can be related to the @xmath4 , respectively @xmath5 , state provided the 4 moments of a tetrahedron have the same component along the local @xmath18 , respectively @xmath19 , axis .",
    "when the field is low enough , the field induced tilted @xmath4-like state becomes hardly distinguishable from the @xmath4 structure so that the discussion in terms of the @xmath120 domains defined in section [ theory ] remains meaningful .",
    "two different phenomena can take place , the _ domain selection _ and/or a _ phase transition _ corresponding to a change of the magnetic structure .",
    "it is worth noting that careful neutron diffraction measurements are necessary to disentangle these two phenomena , requiring one to collect a large number of bragg peaks integrated intensities .",
    "of course , the refinements also have to take into account the presence of several domains , since the magnetic intensities of the bragg peaks can be extremely different depending on the domain which is considered , as reported in table  [ table - dom ] for the six domains of the @xmath4 state and a selection of bragg peaks .",

    "this looks similar to the transition reported above in the @xmath2 $ ] direction .",
    "it is also observed in the magnetization curves , although less sharply , as shown in figure [ dmdh_3dir ] and in ref . .",
    "nevertheless , the physical origin is different since , in this direction , no phase transition occurs at low field .",
    "the refinements show that the magnetic structure tilts continuously from the @xmath4 state up to the transition to the field polarized state at @xmath151 ( see appendix [ app-1m10 ] ) .",
    "actually , this anomalous behavior can be attributed to the selection at finite field of the domains with @xmath152 ( i.e. @xmath106 ) among the six possible domains of the @xmath4 structure , in agreement with the theoretical analysis presented in section [ theory ] .",
    "comparing the results of figure [ figure-110](a ) with the calculations reported in table  [ table - dom ] , we find indeed that above about 0.15 t , the intensities are reproduced by the response of the @xmath106 domains , while below , they are compatible with the average of 6 equipopulated domains .",
    "it is also worth noting that some bragg peaks , like @xmath153 behave differently for positive and negative fields .",
    "this may be due to some domain viscosity that we do not understand at the moment .    according to ref .",
    ", such domain selection is expected to occur around the field @xmath107 , that our magnetization data allow to estimate to @xmath154  mt ( see figure  [ dmdh_3dir ] ) .",
    "the temperature dependence of the @xmath138 curves is similar to the @xmath2 $ ] case , i.e. @xmath107 remains constant while the maximum of the derivative gradually disappears when the temperature increases .      to study the @xmath3 $ ] case , we follow the same approach and present the field dependence of selected magnetic bragg peaks intensities measured at @xmath139  mk ( see figure [ figure-111 ] ) .",
    "the same qualitative observations are made : when the field decreases from the saturation field , a first regime is observed down to @xmath115 where a discontinuity is observed on several peaks .",
    "then , the peak intensities show a smooth evolution down to about 0.2 t , where the system enters another regime with a spectacular intensity increase or decrease , which is bragg dependent .    refinements from the data collections performed at constant fields show that , like in the @xmath8 $ ] case , the system remains in a tilted @xmath4-like state in the whole field range below @xmath115 , suggesting that the intermediate phase predicted to occur at large @xmath118 is not stabilized .    more precisely ,",
    "the refinements show that , below @xmath68 , the magnetic structure is derived from the @xmath155 domain of the @xmath4 state only . below 0.2 t , comparing the results of figure [ figure-111](a ) with the calculations reported in table  [ table - dom ] , we find that the population of the @xmath156 and @xmath157 domains increases while the @xmath155 domain population decreases . the low field anomalous behavior is thus not due to a phase transition but to a domain selection .",
    "this observation differs from the theoretical prediction where an equipopulation of the three domains is expected , due to the absence of the three - fold symmetry breaking when the field is exactly applied along @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "actually , due to a small misalignment of the field ( the angle between @xmath158 $ ] and @xmath159 $ ] with the horizontal scattering plane were measured to be @xmath160 and @xmath161 respectively ) , the @xmath93 term given by eq .",
    "[ df2 ] is reintroduced in the free energy .",

    "the inset emphasizes the small hysteretic anomaly which disappears at 500 mk .",
    ", width=283 ]    the odd behavior of the @xmath164 bragg reflection , which exhibits a small bump around 0.35 t , has to be mentioned here .",
    "this feature is hysteretic and appears for @xmath165 ( resp .",
    "@xmath166 ) when sweeping the field from the positive ( resp .",
    "negative ) side .",
    "its origin remains unclear , as it is not observed on other bragg peaks , such as the @xmath167 and @xmath168 ones .",
    "when increasing the temperature at 500  mk and above , this hysteretic behavior vanishes as shown in figure [ 111_20m2 ] .",
    "the domain selection along this @xmath3 $ ] direction is hardly measurable in the magnetization , as shown in figure [ dmdh_3dir ] .",
    "a very large bump is observed in @xmath138 at about @xmath169 t , which does not move but progressively disappears when the temperature increases .",
    "this is consistent with neutron diffraction measurements at 500 and 800  mk , which show that the change of behavior at low field of the magnetic peaks remains at the same characteristic field but becomes smoother when the temperature increases ( see figure [ 111_20m2 ] ) .",
    "this experimental and systematic low field study is in qualitative agreement with the analysis performed by maryasin et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "when the field is applied along the @xmath2 $ ] direction , the magnetic structure determination from neutron scattering measurements confirms the existence of a spin - flop like transition from the @xmath4 to the @xmath5 state .    along the @xmath8 $ ] direction , our analysis shows that the previously observed but unexplained magnetization anomaly is due to an abrupt domain selection and not to a phase transition .",
    "finally , while it had been proposed as a possible scenario , no phase transition is observed along @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "however , due to a small disorientation of the magnetic field , we can not conclude definitely on this point .",
    "importantly , the characteristic fields do not depend on the temperature up to @xmath170 .",
    "this means that the anisotropy terms are independent of temperature , or have all the same temperature dependence , which is not what is expected a priori , since these terms depend on different powers of the magnetic order parameter .",

    "first , theoretically , @xmath174 . experimentally we get @xmath175 , which is slightly larger although in the same range .",
    "it is possible to go further by considering the expression of the anisotropy terms in the context of the microscopic hamiltonian proposed for er@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the 6-fold anisotropy of @xmath176 is given by : @xmath177 with @xmath178 and the anisotropies relevant in the presence of an applied field write @xcite : @xmath179 with the following parameters @xmath180 mev , @xmath181 mev and @xmath182 , we are now in position to compare theory and experiment ( see table  [ compar ] ) .",
    "the calculated @xmath147 ( and thus @xmath107 ) overestimates the measured value @xcite , giving about 170 mt , against 43  mt obtained experimentally .",
    "since the measurements of the characteristic fields only give access to the ratio @xmath183 , it is not possible to determine whether @xmath86 , @xmath93 or both is responsible for this discrepancy .",
    "nevertheless , this result would tend to indicate that the @xmath93 term is underestimated theoretically .",
    "we can now compare the neutron diffraction and magnetization measurements results with the inelastic neutron scattering experiments .",
    "indeed , as previously discussed , the @xmath86 anisotropy term is responsible for the @xmath4 magnetic ordering in zero field , and gives rise to a gap @xmath74 in the spin wave excitations . from the above study",
    ", it is expected that the other terms will play a role in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "it is thus of interest to focus on the spin dynamics in this low field regime , to get a better insight in these terms . using the theoretical background developed in ref .",
    ", the evolution of the spin gap @xmath74 at low field can be determined . for a field",
    "applied along @xmath8 $ ] , it writes : @xmath184 fitting our measurements ( see figure [ figure - ins](b ) ) , we obtain : @xmath185 mev@xmath186 and @xmath187 mev@xmath188t@xmath186 which leads to : @xmath189 these coefficients are larger than the estimation from the microscopic hamiltonian in the order by disorder scenario ( see table [ compar ] ) , consistently with our above conclusion that @xmath93 is underestimated by the theory .",
    "the @xmath183 ratio , however , leads to @xmath190 mt , in agreement with the theoretical prediction but does not match with the diffraction and magnetization data .",
    "this suggests that the expressions used for @xmath191 and @xmath192 ( see table [ summary ] ) to describe the field induced structures are too simplified and may omit some terms which are not negligible .",
    "this discrepancy may also suggest that some ingredients are missing in the hamiltonian to describe accurately er@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 and in this sense , fits the conclusions drawn from the field dependence of the spin gap below @xmath68 .",
    "by combining neutron diffraction and magnetization measurements , we have shown that a field induced transition occurs when the field is applied along the @xmath2 $ ] direction , as theoretically predicted . in the other directions ,",
    "only domain selection occurs , which manifests as a sharp variation of the magnetic intensities for some bragg peaks .",
    "however , the characteristic fields we have observed are lower than the theoretical predictions , suggesting that the field induced anisotropy terms are stronger than predicted .",
    "the characteristic fields do not depend on temperature : when increasing the temperature , the anomalies broaden but remain at the same position before being suppressed at the nel temperature .",
    "this is a puzzling result which indicates that the key parameter of the transition and domain selections , the @xmath183 ratio , remains constant in the whole ordered regime .",
    "further theoretical studies , beyond the emergent clock anisotropies discussed in ref . , are thus needed to quantitatively understand our observations .",
    "finally , the field dependence of the spin gap is not reproduced by the lsw and vcf models , pointing out that additional terms , such as multispin interactions , may have to be considered in the hamiltonian to describe the field induced properties .",
    "below @xmath147 , the refinements were carried out using the 6 domains of the @xmath4 configuration belonging to the @xmath6 irreducible representation . above @xmath147 ,",
