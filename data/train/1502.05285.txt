    "solid fullerene polymerization is a well  established phenomenon @xcite .",
    "c@xmath1 can polymerize by undergoing high temperature and high pressure treatments , after ion irradiation or by exposure to light @xcite . in all these cases ,",
    "fullerene units invariably connect together by four - membered carbon rings , via [ 2 + 2 ] cyclo  addition reactions @xcite .",
    "the intercalation of light electron donors ( _ i.e. _ alkali atoms li or na ) in the voids of the host fullerene lattice can sometimes induce the formation of polymerized structures . in this case , the charge transfer from the metal to the highly electronegative c@xmath1 provides the necessary _ chemical pressure _ for adjacent buckyballs to be close enough together to establish intermolecular bonds .",
    "a large variety of 1d @xcite and 2d @xcite fulleride polymer structures was found when intercalated with small - alkali atoms .",
    "in addition to the aforementioned cycloaddition mechanism , fullerenes can connect through single c - c bonds . in the latter category , lithium intercalated fullerides li@xmath3c@xmath1 @xmath4 ,",
    "are remarkable because their structure consists of 2d polymeric fullerenes interconnected by a sequence of single c - c bonds and four - membered carbon rings , propagating along two orthogonal directions in the polymer plane @xcite .",
    "li@xmath0c@xmath1 belongs to this class of compounds , together with the isostructural alkali - earth intercalated mg@xmath5c@xmath1 polymer , suggesting that the on - ball charge transfer is the key factor driving the polymerization arrangement in these systems @xcite .",
    "the coexistence of the two bonding schemes was also observed in the _ fullerenium salt _ c@xmath1(asf@xmath6)@xmath7 . in this",
    "solid , the fullerene units are oxidized to the state c@xmath8 , a rather unstable condition , which results in an unusual 1d zigzag polymerization @xcite . + in addition to its novel structure , li@xmath0c@xmath1 shows a very large ionic conductivity at low temperature , which is an exceptional property for a solid material .",
    "the ionic conductivity reaches the value of @xmath9 10@xmath10 s / cm at room temperature , which is comparable to that observed in liquid electrolytes , indicating that this material could possibly find applications , for example , in fuel cell devices @xcite .",
    "this physical property originates from the presence of intrinsic unoccupied sites interconnected by @xmath11 pathways in the crystalline structure , allowing the diffusion of the li@xmath12 ions .",
    "the large amplitude movements of the @xmath13 cages _",
    "e.g. _ their rotations or radial deformations , can facilitate the li@xmath12 ions jumping from one site to another .",
    "such dynamical disorder is intrinsically involved in the atomic mechanisms leading to oxygen diffusion in certain oxides , like the onset of mo0@xmath14 free rotations in bi@xmath15mo@xmath16o@xmath17 @xcite . in general the superionic character of a material",
    "follows an order - disorder transition which unlocks large amplitude movements . in li@xmath0c@xmath1 ,",
    "no such transition is observed and the superionic nature of the material appears progressively in an apparently very ordered fullerene host structure . +",
    "it is possible to break the intermolecular bonds and recover the monomer phase through a moderate thermal annealing .",
    "the resulting phase shows an unexpected metallic behaviour @xcite which appears to be in contrast with accepted theories indicating the a@xmath0c@xmath1 compounds ( a = alkali metal ) to be mott - jahn teller insulators @xcite . + in the present work we report on the use of neutron scattering to study li@xmath0c@xmath1 .",

    "i.e_. in a regime where the li diffusion is hindered .",
    "rietveld refinement is used to precisely localise the carbon atoms of the distorted fullerene cage especially those involved in the intermolecular bonds and to reveal the li positions in the host lattice . the structural information",
    "is then used to calculate the lattice dynamics of the polymeric system in the harmonic approximation .",
    "the phonon dispersion curves , the vibrational density of states and the thermodynamic properties of this molecular system are discussed .",

    "rietveld analysis was performed using the gsas+expgui software .",
    "the starting peak profile was determined by a preliminary le bail pattern decomposition and the background contribution was modelled with a polynomial curve containing 21 coefficients .",
    "the structural analysis was started without considering the li ions , due to the low ( negative ) scattering length of @xmath18li with respect to c. the initial fullerene arrangement was obtained by considering the carbon positions of the polymeric chains in kc@xmath1 ( where c@xmath1 are connected by [ 2 + 2]-cycloaddition bonds ) , as described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "then , the fullerene chains were correctly rotated around their axis and the necessary transformations were applied to the atomic coordinates , in order to match the correct symmetry and the cell dimensions of li@xmath0c@xmath1 ( @xmath64 = 9.329(1 )  , @xmath65 = 9.054(1 )  , @xmath66 = 14.984(1) , @xmath67 = 90.91(1)@xmath68 , space group i2/m ) , with the [ 2 + 2 ] polymerisation running along the @xmath65-axis @xcite . at this stage , we found that the minimum in the @xmath69 agreement factor was reached by rotating the fullerene chains by @xmath70 with respect to their arrangement in kc@xmath1 .",
    "as expected , at this stage , the diffraction profile was not well described during the rietveld refinement ( @xmath71 ) . however , a significant improvement was observed when the positions of the carbons c(15 ) , which are involved in the _ single _ c - c bonds , and their neighbours ( c(5 ) and c(16 ) ) were refined .",
    "although the refinement process was always rather stable , due to the high number of observables available ( 1401 ) , soft constraints were applied to carbon positions of the whole asymmetric unit and the convergence was reached by slowly decreasing the f - factor ( penalty factor ) at each cycle .",
    "further enhancement of the fit ( to @xmath72 ) was gained with the refinement of the carbon c(1 ) forming the four - membered carbon ring and its neighbours ( c(2 ) and c(3 ) ) .",
    "finally , the fractional coordinates of all the remaining ten c atoms of the asymmetric unit were refined stepwise . the best agreement between the observed and calculated data was obtained for an interfullerene c(15)-c(15 ) bond of 1.61(2 )  .",
    "the latter distance is significantly smaller than that previously derived from synchrotron data ( d@xmath73 = 1.75(2)@xcite ) , falling into a more reasonable range if one compares it with a typical c - c bond length .",
    "moreover , no anomalous distances were detected in the fullerene molecule , the bond lengths being close to the standard values of 1.54   and 1.42  , for sp@xmath74 and sp@xmath75 c - c bonds respectively .",
    "li@xmath0c@xmath1 at 3.5 k. the data are indicated by black crosses , the rietveld fit by the solid red line and the difference by the solid blue line .",
    "ticks marks indicate the reflection positions ( @xmath69 = 3.83% , @xmath76 = 1.16% ) .",
    "the fulleride structure is displayed in the inset , with the carbon nomenclature.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    solid state nmr and dc and ac conductivity @xcite clearly indicate that the li ions are pinned at special positions in the lattice at the temperature at which the diffraction data were collected .",
    "this means that no ionic diffusion is expected at 3.5 k. the structural analysis performed at room temperature using the synchrotron data distinguished two types of symmetry inequivalent li ions , located respectively inside the pseudo - tetrahedral ( li@xmath77 ) and pseudo - octahedral ( li@xmath78 ) voids of the parent cubic lattice @xcite . in the present , low temperature neutron investigation",
    ", the study of the small alkali ion position was attempted using fourier map analysis , _",
    "i.e. _ exploiting the large contrast arising from the negative neutron scattering length of @xmath18li .",
    "we found that a significant fraction of intercalated alkali ions occupy the position ( 0.44(1 ) 0 0.76(1 ) ) , which corresponds to the small pseudo - tetrahedral voids , in agreement with the previous analysis .",
    "the insertion of li@xmath77 atoms with full occupancy improved significantly the quality of the fit ( @xmath69 = 3.99% ) .",
    "+ in contrast , the fourier maps did not provide clear evidence of the occupation of the larger pseudo - octahedral sites , showing at these positions an unexpectedly poor contrast .",
    "the reason for this observation was first ascribed to the combined effect of the small absolute value of @xmath18li scattering length , as compared to c , in addition to the low amount of the alkali ions in the compound .",
    "in fact , if both effects are taken into account , the contribution of li to the scattered intensity turns out to be two orders of magnitude smaller than that of carbon .",
    "another hypothesis is that the li@xmath78 ions present a certain degree of disorder , _",
    "e.g. _ populating different octahedral sites in the lattice with similar energy and experiencing slightly different local potentials .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by dft calculations @xcite . the spread of li@xmath78 ions over different positions in the octahedral voids in the lattice is also expected to strongly reduce the contrast of the fourier maps .",
    "+ however , a careful analysis of the scattering reveals the existence of negative intensity close to the position ( 0.28 , 0 , 0.32 ) , which is significantly shifted with respect to the center of the octahedral void . the insertion of the li@xmath78 alkali ion at this position with a full occupancy further improved the agreement factor ( @xmath69= 3.83% ) , suggesting that li@xmath78 ions tend to move away from the center of the octahedral sites with decreasing temperature .",
    "a similar behaviour was recently observed for highly - doped li fullerene compounds , where li ions were found to form clusters around the center of the tetrahedral positions of the parent cubic lattice @xcite in the ground - state , leaving the octahedral sites unoccupied .",
    "+ in the final configuration , the closest li - li distance found is of @xmath79  , similar to the atomic distance found in li metal ( @xmath80  ) , while the li@xmath12-c@xmath1 contacts reveal a short distance of the order of @xmath81  , which is equal to the sum of the ionic radius of li@xmath12 ( @xmath82  ) and the van der waals radius of c ( @xmath83  ) .",
    "the result of the rietveld refinement performed on the neutron data is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig:1-rietveld ] .",
    "the geometry relaxation was performed in two steps : the first one consisted of optimizing the atomic positions while keeping the lattice parameters at the values obtained by neutron diffraction .",
    "the experimental structure described above was used as the starting structure . the optimized geometry obtained this way",
    "was further relaxed by allowing lattice parameters to vary as well .",
    "the optimized structure was then considered for phonon calculations .",
    "we have checked that both relaxed geometries gave comparable results in terms of phonon dispersion curves and phonon density of states .",
    "the full relaxation however gave a better result in terms of there being no negative phonon frequencies in any part of the brillouin zone and a slightly better agreement with the neutron derived phonon dos .",
    "the resulting structure has lattice parameters @xmath64 = 9.38  , @xmath65 = 9.12  , @xmath66 = 15.59  , with angles @xmath84 = @xmath85 = 90@xmath86 and monoclinic angle @xmath67 = 91.18@xmath86 .",
    "this gives a @xmath87 = 5% expansion of the lattice with regards to the experimental structure .",
    "relaxed interatomic distances are , @xmath88 1.44   ( sp@xmath89 bonds between two hexagons ) ; @xmath90 1.42   ( sp@xmath89 bonds between one hexagon and one pentagon ) ; @xmath91 1.56   ( sp@xmath92 single bond between adjacent molecules ) , @xmath93)\\sim$ ] 1.64   ( sp@xmath92 bond in the [ 2 + 2 ] cycloaddition ) . in agreement with the diffraction investigations ,",
    "the li atoms are substantially displaced with regards to the centers of the parent tetrahedral and octahedral voids in cubic @xmath13 .",
    "they form atomic planes of atoms in the space between two successive polymer sheets ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : li4c60_i2mcell ] ) .",
    "the crystal symmetry point group of li@xmath0c@xmath1 is @xmath94 .",
    "the vibrational representation of the system is composed of the non - degenerate a@xmath95(r ) , b@xmath95(r ) , a@xmath96(ir ) and b@xmath96(ir ) irreducible representations .",
    "the phonon modes at point @xmath97 are either raman ( r ) or infrared ( ir ) active . the complete list of the modes , classified according to their symmetry and frequency , are presented in tables  [ tab : tab_ram_cdz ] and  [ tab : tab_ir_cdz ] .",
    "the calculated frequencies are compared to those of the principal features observed in the raman , ir and high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy ( hreels ) spectra reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "note that hreels is subject to the same selection rules as ir .",
    "the association between the calculated and the observed modes is based on the best match between their frequency and other arguments like , for example , their relative position with regards to common spectral gaps .",
    "compared to bulk c@xmath1 , for which only 13 modes are raman active and 6 are ir active @xcite ( including lattice modes ) , resulting in 19 observable modes , the reduced symmetry of the li@xmath98c@xmath1 lattice , added to the deformation of the fullerene cages due to polymerization , increases the number of optically active modes to 95 raman and 94 ir active modes .",
    "this renders the interpretation of the raman and ir spectra based only on the frequency match between the experimental and calculated features very difficult .",
    "a definitive attribution of the observed features would require the calculation of the intensity of the raman / ir active modes which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "+ in this section we restrict the discussion to two types of raman active modes which are of particular interest and which are extensively discussed in the literature .",
    "the first one concerns the double peak feature located around 120 mev ( 119 and 121.5 mev in li@xmath0c@xmath1 ) which is often associated to the stretching of the [ 2 + 2 ] bond in polymeric c@xmath1 .",
    "however its observation in the raman spectrum of the single bonded polymer na@xmath0c@xmath1 has raised a question about this attribution @xcite . in the experimental raman spectra , this feature appears well separated from the preceding raman peak at lower frequency by a @xmath215 mev gap . in tab .",
    "[ tab : tab_ram_cdz ] , these two extreme features are observed at 119 and 102.7 mev respectively .",
    "our calculations also predict a 15 mev frequency range populated essentially by ir active modes .",
    "they create a gap in the raman spectra between 108 mev and 123 mev .",
    "therefore , we attribute the observed 119 mev features to a a@xmath95 active mode which is represented in fig .  [ fig : r_123mev ] .",
    "this mode shows a complex displacement pattern , composed mostly of single - bond deformations , but also of [ 2 + 2 ] contributions .",
    "in contrast , the modes located at lower frequencies imply essentially movements of the atoms forming the [ 2 + 2 ] bridge . in fig .",
    "[ fig : r_102mev ] we show the b@xmath95 mode calculated at 102.5 mev .",
    "its displacement pattern represents the buckling of the [ 2 + 2 ] square - like bridge out of the polymer plane , _",
    "i.e _ along the @xmath99 direction .",
    "we attribute to this mode the peak observed at 102.7 mev in the raman spectra .",
    "other raman active modes , implying the deformation of this intermolecular bridge , are calculated in this frequency range : a b@xmath95 mode at 103.8 mev and a a@xmath95 mode at 104.7 mev , the latter mode being associated with the stretching of the bridge along the @xmath100 direction ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : r_105mev ] ) .",
    "they could also be attributed to the feature observed in the raman spectra at 102.7 mev .    in conclusion ,",
    "our calculations propose that the features in the raman spectra observed in the range around 105 mev are associated to the [ 2 + 2 ] bond deformations , _",
    "e.g. _ at frequencies significantly smaller than those of polymeric forms of c@xmath1 obtained at high pressure and high temperature .",
    "their contribution to the phonon density of states ( dos ) is sharp and observed at @xmath2103 - 105 mev in the total dos spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdos ] .",
    "the deformation of the [ 2 + 2 ] cyclic bond , therefore appears as a highly localised mode featuring a sharp peak in the pdos of the c atoms involved in this bond ( see brown line in the top part of fig .  [",
    "fig : pdos ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the phonon modes involving single bond contributions are calculated to be hybridized with other molecule deformations to a large extent .",
    "they give a significant contribution in the 120 - 150 mev range .",
    "their contribution to the dos is relatively smooth ( see magenta line in the top part of fig .",
    "[ fig : pdos ] top ) .",
    "the second raman feature that we discuss in this section concerns the so  called `` pentagonal pinch mode '' .",
    "it refers to a c@xmath1 mode , of a@xmath95 symmetry in bulk c@xmath1 , located at 182 mev ( 1469 cm@xmath24 ) involving tangential displacements of the atoms and in particular , contraction of the pentagonal rings of the fullerene .",
    "its frequency is known to red - shift depending on the number of polymeric bonds per molecule @xcite and/or the charge carried by the fullerene @xcite according to the empirical rule : -0.8 mev per excess electron , -0.3 mev per single covalent bond and -0.7 mev per [ 2 + 2 ] covalent bond . a mode in the raman spectra of li@xmath0c@xmath1",

    "our calculation predicts a a@xmath95 raman active mode at a frequency of 178.6 mev .",
    "this pure cage deformation mode is represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : pinch_mode ] and presents a pattern close to the one expected from the a@xmath95(2 ) `` pentagonal pinch mode '' of bulk c@xmath1 . following the empirical rule described above",
    ", we anticipate a charge transfer of about 2e per cage @xcite , a value substantially lower than that proposed by macovez _",
    "et al . _ who derived a value closer to 3e ( 2.7e ) from the analysis of the photoemission spectrum of a li@xmath98c@xmath1 film @xcite .",
    "both predictions however agree on the partial nature of the charge transferred from the lithium to the fullerene cage , a tendency already known in intercalated fullerene systems @xcite .",
    "the analysis of our simulations , using the bader @xcite approach , indicates a total charge of 726.1 electrons per c@xmath1 which means a charge of @xmath2 - 3e per cage and a partial charge transfer from the li atoms to the c@xmath1 cage which amounts to @xmath20.75e per alkali ion .",
    "this value is in very good agreement with the value proposed by macovez _",
    "et al._. in addition , the calculations reproduce well the experimental frequency of the pentagonal pinch mode raman feature .",
    "this observation reinforces the difficulty of deriving the excess of charge transferred to the fullerene in polymeric form based on the frequency of the raman feature alone .",
    "any use of the above described rule will lead to an underestimate of the on  ball charge transfer .    *",

    "<S> the two - dimensional polymer structure and lattice dynamics of the superionic conductor li@xmath0c@xmath1 are investigated by neutron diffraction and spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> the peculiar bonding architecture of this compound is confirmed through the precise localisation of the carbon atoms involved in the intermolecular bonds . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral features of this phase are revealed through a combination of _ ab - initio _ lattice dynamics calculations and inelastic neutron scattering experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the neutron scattering observables are found to be in very good agreement with the simulations which predict a partial charge transfer from the li atoms to the c@xmath1 cage . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of a well defined band associated with the li atoms in the experimental spectrum suggests that this species is not ordered even at the lowest temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations predict an unstable li sublattice at a temperature of @xmath2 200 k , that we relate to the large ionic diffusivity of this system : low frequency optic modes of the li ions couple to the soft structure of the polymer . </S>"
