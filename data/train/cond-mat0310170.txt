    "random graphs were introduced more than forty years ago by mathematicians and have proved since then to be a very useful and versatile concept .",
    "the most studied example is the erds - renyi model @xcite , where the edges are independent .",
    "balanced with the simplicity of its definition , the richness and deepness of mathematical results are really fascinating .",
    "on the other hand , it is clear that the erds - renyi model is a poor idealization of real networks , those which pop out naturally in sociology , biology , communication sciences , ... for instance , the degree distribution ( i.e. the statistics of the number of edges incident at a vertex ) of most of the real life examples exhibits statistical , scale - free , properties very far from the poissonian behavior predicted by the erds - renyi model @xcite,@xcite .",
    "many random graph models are now on the market , some consructed ad hoc to reproduce certain desired features needed to fit real data , some constructed according to general principles .",
    "belonging to the second category , the molloy - reed model @xcite concentrates , inside the space of all labeled graphs with uniform probability , on the subspace of graphs with an arbitrarily given degree distribution . within this model ,",
    "many relevant quantities can be computed analytically , and there is a general percolation criterion given in terms of cumulants of the edge degree distribution .",
    "our aim is to study another family of random graphs for which explicit computations are also possible .",
    "the idea is roughly as follows .",
    "suppose that to each graph @xmath0 one assigns a weight @xmath1 .",
    "from the weight @xmath2 one can construct another weight @xmath3 where the sum is over graphs @xmath4 with the same vertex set as @xmath0 and edge set included in that of @xmath0 .",
    "conversely , from any weight function @xmath5 one can extract a unique weight function @xmath2 , but the expression of @xmath2 in terms of @xmath5 involves minus signs .",
    "we shall introduce a model for which the weight @xmath2 is a counting function for certain structures on graphs .",
    "this weight @xmath2 has two further properties : first it is permutation invariant , i.e. the weight of a graph does not depend on the labelling of its vertices , and second it factors over connected components , i.e the weight for a graph with several connected components is the product of the weight of each component . note that by standard combinatorial arguments , these three properties are inherited by the weight @xmath5",
    ".    then we study the thermodynamic finite connectivity limit , when the size of the system ( i.e. the number of vertices of the graph ) becomes large but the average number of neighbors of any given vertex has a fixed finite value . in this regime ,",
    "the relevant features of the weights @xmath2 and @xmath5 are encoded in tree generating functions @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively .",
    "the idea is that because @xmath2 counts less objects than @xmath5 ( which is not true for arbitrary @xmath5 because then @xmath2 does not have a simple combinatorial interpretation in general ) , the generating function @xmath6 has better convergence properties than the corresponding generating function @xmath7 .",
    "we shall make the ( crucial ) assumption that the first singularity in the generating function of @xmath5 can be obtained from the functional relation that ties it to the generating function of @xmath2 , without having to know the singularities of the generating function for @xmath2 itself .",
    "this is certainly true , as we shall recall later , for the erds - renyi model .",
    "it is also true order by order in perturbation theory around the erds - renyi model for the models we introduce .",
    "we shall have little to say analytically on non perturbative properties , but the numerical simulations are encouraging .    under this assumption",
    "we are able to give expressions for the free energy , the size distribution of connected components and for the percolation criterion and size of the giant component when it exists .",
    "the expressions are not very explicit , because they involve the function @xmath6 , which is very complicated in terms of the original parameters of the model .",
    "so on the one hand we show how to perform explicit perturbative computations of the physical quantities and on the other hand we introduce an effective model for which the relationship between @xmath2 and @xmath6 is directly computable ,    our motivations are the following .",
    "first the models we study form a natural and reasonnably manageable family of random graph models .",
    "our point is to emphasize the connection with quantum field theory .",
    "we do not claim that the relation is very deep , but many random graph phenomena have quantum field theory counterparts , and quantum field theory gives a very convenient language and insight .",
    "second , one of the interests of studying models with non trivial degree correlations is that attacks ( see e.g. @xcite,@xcite ) automatically induce such features , even if they were absent to begin with .",
    "third , at a more basic level , we can contrast with the molloy - reed model .",
    "this is useful for the purpose of general comparison , but especially because heuristic arguments , always based on non explicit assumptions , allow to recover the molloy - reed percolation criterion whitout using the particular hypothesis of the molloy - reed model , thereby suggesting that the molloy - reed percolation criterion has a much wider range of validity .",
    "this is probably wrong , and the model solved in this paper is definitely not in this range .",
    "after recalling the elementary graph theoretic definitions , we present our basic assumptions .",
    "we use the framework of statistical mechanics , i.e. we assign to each labelled graph of size @xmath8 a weight ( real positive number ) , which we use as an unnormalized probability distribution . for the erds - renyi model ,",
    "the weight is simply @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the number of edges of @xmath0 .",
    "we shall choose a weight function that depends on more detailed local features of the graph , namely the abundance of certain geometric motives .",

    "note that @xmath46 is again equal to @xmath10 .      to emphasize the similarities between the random graph model studied in this paper and quantum field theory , we split the weight of graphs in a product of a free part and an interacting part .",

    "the interacting part is @xmath50 , where @xmath51 the full weight is @xmath52 the normalization factor included in the definition of the partition function @xmath53 is chosen in such a way that @xmath54 can be expressed as an average over erds - renyi weights : @xmath55 where @xmath56 assigns probability @xmath57 to any graph on @xmath8 vertices with @xmath35 edges .",
    "we view @xmath58 as describing a gas of independent edges ( the erds - renyi model ) , and @xmath59 as describing the interactions between edges , the @xmath60 s and @xmath61 s being arbitrary real parameters that regulate the abundance of certain local geometric features of @xmath0 .",

    "this is also true of @xmath58 .",
    "this multiplicativity of the weight plays a crucial role to simplify the analysis below .",
    "another striking feature is that @xmath65 is invariant under permutations of the vertex set .",
    "many other interactions with this property could be incorporated , for instance by including products of traces and norms into the interaction , however these would break the multiplicativity property .",
    "the `` simple '' multiplicative model does not seem to be exactly solvable , and we have to rely on perturbation theory to make explicit computations .",
    "even the `` trival '' case when all parameters except , say , @xmath66 vanish is already complicated enough .",
    "this is why we insist on keeping the two properties : multiplicativity and permutation invariance .",
    "the above model is perfectly well defined for all parameter values as long as @xmath8 is finite . however , we shall be interested in taking a large @xmath8 limit such that the average degree is a fixed number ( so that the number of edges is proportional to @xmath8 ) .",
    "this will impose some constraints , see below .",
    "in this section , we shall derive two formul  related to exponentiation in combinatorics .",
    "suppose we consider the grand canonical partition function @xmath67 as a power series in @xmath68 : this is a formal sum over all graphs of any size , from which @xmath54 can be recovered as @xmath69 where for the time being , the symbol @xmath70 is not viewed as a real contour integral , but simply as the operation of taking the term of order @xmath8 in the @xmath68 expansion of a formal power series . if @xmath0 has @xmath71 connected components @xmath62 , we observe that    @xmath72 summing over @xmath0 is the same as summing over the connected components .",
    "up to now the vertices of the @xmath73 were labelled as subgraphs of @xmath0 .",
    "thanks to permutation invariance , one can instead sum over abstract finite sequences of @xmath74 labelled connected graphs but weight the terms in the sum by a combinatorial factor @xmath75 to take into account all possibilities to order them and to label the union of their vertex sets from @xmath76 to @xmath77 .",
    "then @xmath78 where @xmath79 is defined exactly as @xmath80 except that the sum is only over connected graphs ( this is what is meant by the symbol @xmath81 ) .",
    "the main formula of this section , the first exponential formula , relates @xmath54 and @xmath82 as @xmath83      the case when @xmath84 for all @xmath85 corresponds to the erds - renyi model .",
    "the probability of a graph only depends on the number of its edges , and many quantities such as degree distributions , component distributions and percolation threshold take a simple form .",
    "when one or more of the @xmath60 s and @xmath61 s are not vanishing , the finer structure of the graph becomes relevant , and this will be the case of interest in this paper .",
    "let us fix @xmath0 and start from the expansion of @xmath86 in powers of @xmath60 s and @xmath61 s .",
    "this gives a linear combination of terms of the form : @xmath87 if we expand each matrix product , such a term becomes a sum of products of matrix elements of @xmath36 of generic form @xmath88 and we may assume that @xmath89 because otherwise the product is @xmath90 for any ( simple graph ) adjacency matrix . on the other hand , to any sequence @xmath91 with @xmath92 , we may associate a graph @xmath93 with vertex set @xmath94 $ ] and edge set @xmath95 . the product @xmath96 vanishes unless all edges of @xmath93 are edges of @xmath0 , in which case it has value 1 .    with this observation in mind , we define @xmath97 by keeping , in the expansion of @xmath86 , only those terms @xmath98 such that @xmath95 exhausts the edge set of @xmath0 ( maybe with repetitions ) . then by definition , @xmath99 where the sum is over all graphs on the same vertex set as @xmath0 whose edge set is a subset of that of @xmath0 .",
    "the reciprocal formula is given by @xmath100 and the multiplicative property of @xmath86 ensures that @xmath101 is also multiplicative : if @xmath93 has @xmath71 connected components @xmath102 , @xmath103    now @xmath104 for fixed @xmath93 , @xmath105 , and we find that @xmath106 defining @xmath107 we can repeat the steps leading from multiplicativity and permutation invariance to eq.([eq:1expform ] ) to obtain the second exponential formula @xmath108      the two expressions obtained for the partition function , one in terms of @xmath82 and the other in terms of @xmath109 , show that for every nonnegative integer @xmath8 @xmath110    it is convenient to eliminate @xmath8 by the following trick : putting @xmath111 , @xmath112 takes the form of a gaussian integral @xmath113 . from the change of variable @xmath114",
    ", it follows that @xmath115 there is no good reason why @xmath116 should be integrable in @xmath117 along the full real axis .",
    "however , if one expands this function in powers of @xmath68 , term by term integration is ok , and for the time being , eq.([eq : egalexact ] ) is a shorthand notation for the fact that this term by term integration leads to the formal power series of @xmath118 .",
    "our aim is to organize the perturbative expansion to make explicit computations .",
    "we would like to make a systematic enumeration of the terms that appear in perturbation theory .",
    "a typical term in the perturbative expansion is of the form @xmath119 to which we associate the sequence @xmath120 i.e. a word written using the alphabet @xmath94 $ ] . for a graph @xmath0 with adjacency matrix @xmath121 ,",
    "the product @xmath122 is @xmath76 if @xmath123 are amongst the edges of @xmath0 and @xmath90 else . if @xmath71 is the number of distinct edges among these @xmath124 2-sets , the average is simply the sum of the erds - renyi weights of all graphs containing these @xmath71 edges",
    "this is known to yield @xmath125 .",
    "this average is invariant under permutations of @xmath94 $ ] , all vertices play the same role in @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "so we regroup the words @xmath120 in classes under the action of the permutation group , compute the size of each class and find a representative in each class . then we enumerate the representatives and take multiplicities into account .    the idea is the following : suppose that you have a finite word written using any alphabet ( i.e. any set of symbols ) on , say , n letters .",
    "to each letter that appears in the word , associate an integer as follows : assign @xmath76 to the first letter of the word , then assign @xmath128 to the next new ( i.e distinct from the first ) letter appearing in the word , then @xmath129 to the next new ( i.e distinct from the first and the second ) and so on until all letters appearing in the word have been assigned a number , the highest one being , say , @xmath130 ( @xmath130 is the number of distinct letters used to compose the word , which may well be strictly smaller than the length of the word , because the same letter can appear more than once ) .",
    "replacing each letter of the word by its number leads to a new word , the alphabet being @xmath131 \\subset [ 1,n]$ ] this time .",
    "the words obtained by this procedure are characterized by the fact that @xmath76 appears before @xmath128 which appears before @xmath129 and so on .",
    "say that two words in the original alphabet are equivalent if they yield the same numerical word by the above procedure .",
    "then each class contains @xmath132 words .    in our case ,",
    "the original alphabet is already @xmath94 $ ] , and we are led to the concept of normalized sequences , an elaboration of a procedure introduced in a slightly simpler context in @xcite .      for an arbitrary sequence @xmath133 ( with alphabet @xmath94 $ ] ) such that @xmath89 , we define @xmath134 , the number of distinct vertices in the sequence , and @xmath135,the number of distinct edges in the sequence .",
    "we shall say that a sequence @xmath133 is normalized with respect to @xmath136 or more simply with respect to @xmath137 if    * @xmath138 . * in this sequence , @xmath76 comes before @xmath128 , which comes before @xmath129 , ... which comes before @xmath130 .",
    "* @xmath139 . *",
    "the sequence has a correct structure as regards @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "that is , to @xmath142 ( @xmath143 ) and @xmath144 ( @xmath145 ) correspond the constraints @xmath146 , with the additional constraint @xmath147 for @xmath142 .",
    "if more than one term of @xmath137 is nonzero , then we choose an arbitrary ordering : increasing @xmath85 s , all traces coming before norms .",
    "this allows to decompose the sequence in subsequences , which correspond either to a trace or a norm , and are accordingly constrained .",
    "for instance , when @xmath148 and @xmath149 are the only nonvanishing elements of @xmath137 , the sequence has a correct structure if it is of the form @xmath150 where @xmath151 and @xmath152 ( to @xmath153 correspond no constraint of structure ) .",
    "we write @xmath154 for the number of normalized sequences with @xmath130 vertices and @xmath71 edges . by our previous remarks ,",
    "the class containing a normalized sequence has @xmath132 members , each of which leads to the same average .",
    "hence    @xmath155    in doing explicit computations , which can be painful , there is a useful check of the formula , namely a sum rule corresponding to @xmath156 , in which case only the complete graph contributes , and there is no average to compute .",
    "it is staightforward to check that if @xmath0 is the complete graph on @xmath8 vertices , @xmath157 hence @xmath158      although the interpretation in terms of normalized sequences is adequate for the purpose of numerical computations , there is another useful graphical representation of the perturbation series which we present briefly now .",
    "+ expanding @xmath159 we represent each term as a colouring of a labelled cycle on @xmath85 vertices with @xmath8 colours , vertex @xmath160 carrying color @xmath161 for @xmath162 . in the same way",

    "look at the star shaped tree on @xmath124 vertices , whose adjacency matrix we denote by @xmath230 , with a center connected to the @xmath231 other vertices . from @xmath232 , @xmath233 , @xmath234 and @xmath235 , it is easy to compute recursively that @xmath236 and @xmath237 for @xmath238 , and that @xmath239 and @xmath240 for @xmath241 . as an example , consider again the case when there is only one nonvanishing perturbation parameter , say @xmath66 .",
    "the contribution of star shaped trees to @xmath7 is @xmath242 .",
    "as all trees give a positive contribution to @xmath5 , no compensation is possible and we conclude that if @xmath243 , the series for @xmath5 has a vanishing radius of convergence .",
    "so it is meaningless to deform contours , and eq.([eq : mainw ] ) is meaningless as well .",
    "then so is eq.([eq : mainu ] ) because analyticity of @xmath244 at small @xmath117 implies analyticity of @xmath245 at small @xmath246 via eq.([eq : mainuw ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath247 , the star - shaped trees of large size are very strongly suppressed .",

    "if @xmath249 for all trees , using the fact that there are @xmath250 labelled trees on @xmath124 vertices , we see that @xmath251 , leading to a nonzero radius of convergence .    for instance",
    ", when the sign of every perturbation is negative , the radius of convergence is a nonincreasing function of the @xmath60 s and @xmath61 s : it gets larger and larger as the @xmath60 s and @xmath61 s get more negative . to see that it remains finite , consider the linear graph on @xmath124 vertices , whose adjacency matrix we denote by @xmath252 . for this graph , for fixed @xmath85 and large @xmath124 , @xmath253 and @xmath254 grow at most linearly with @xmath124 : they count @xmath85 steps walks , and if the starting point is given , at each step there are at most two choices , so there is the obvious upper bound @xmath255 .",
    "there are @xmath256 ways to label the linear graph ( the symmetry group is of order @xmath128 ) . so the contribution of the linear trees to @xmath7 decreases at most geometrically with the size .",
    "as all trees give a nonnegative contribution , @xmath7 has its first singularity on the real positive axis , and at a finite distance .",
    "in the situation when @xmath7 has a finite radius of convergence , we conclude that there is a forest - like regime for the perturbed erds - renyi model that extends the forest - like regime of the pure erds - renyi model , and that it is described by the equations eqs.([eq : mainu],[eq : mainw],[eq : mainuw ] ) , at least in the small @xmath206 phase .",
    "we shall elaborate on this point in the sequel .      as we have seen before ,",
    "the above formul  for the free energy rely on crucial assumptions .",
    "what we would like to show in this subsection , before embarking on a detailed discussion of analytic features of these equations , is that the combinatorics embodied in eq.([eq : mainuw ] ) is correct .",
    "suppose that we forget about the random graph model for a moment , and consider instead a random forest model , @xmath5 being the generating function for random weighted trees .",
    "expand the function @xmath257 in powers of @xmath68 : @xmath258 .",
    "it is well - known from quantum field theory that the formal expansion of @xmath259 is a weighted sum of all connected feynmann graphs .",
    "the weight of a feynmann graph is computed as follows : each edge gives a factor @xmath260 ( propagator ) , each vertex of degree @xmath71 gives a factor @xmath261 and finally one divides by the order of the symmetry group of the graph .",
    "the logarithm is given by the same sum , but restricted to connected graphs .",
    "for connected graphs , the power of @xmath260 is the number of loops minus @xmath76 , so the dominant contribution in the small @xmath260 limit restricts the sum to connected loopless graphs , i.e. trees . on the other hand ,",
    "the small @xmath260 limit is given by the saddle point approximation , i.e. eq.([eq : mainuw ] ) .",
    "so @xmath7 is a sum over all trees , each vertex of degree @xmath71 giving a factor @xmath262 .",
    "but @xmath263 itself is a tree generating function , so @xmath262 is the generating function for trees with @xmath71 marked vertices ( a vertex can be marked more than once ) .",
    "so eq.([eq : mainuw ] ) means that to construct @xmath7 , one takes arbitrary trees , ( call them naked trees ) and then blows up every vertex of degree @xmath71 into a new tree with @xmath71 marked vertices from which naked edges emerge .",
    "note that a naked vertex can be blown up in a trivial tree , corresponding to the term @xmath246 in @xmath264 .    as we have emphasized before , if @xmath265 is a tree , each term @xmath266 in the expansion of @xmath267 in terms of matrix elements of the adjacency matrix @xmath37 of @xmath265 defines a subgraph of @xmath265 i.e. a forest with the same vertex set as @xmath265 , edge @xmath268 being present in the forest if and only if the term @xmath266 contains the factor @xmath121 or @xmath269 .",
    "but the connected components of the forest being given , one reconstructs @xmath7 by connecting the different components with appropriate edges .",
    "this is exactly the procedure described by eq.([eq : mainuw ] ) if @xmath7 is the generating function for @xmath267 and @xmath6 the one for @xmath270 .",
    "if we have the original model in mind , each @xmath271 is itself a highly nontrivial kind of partition function .",
    "however , if we take each @xmath271 as an independent parameter , we can make a rather general analysis .",
    "in fact , there is a simple model for which the @xmath271 s are the fundamental microscopic parameters in the sense that they appear directly in the definition of the weights .",
    "we call this model an effective model for the following reasons .    in quantum field theory",
    ", the term `` effective '' often means that one renounces to deal with all observables of a system and only concentrates on certain degrees of freedom , so that the other ones can be averaged .",
    "for instance , to compute the long distance behaviour , one first averages over the short distance fluctuations . we are going to do something analogous here : we renounce to observe the local structure of connected components and are only interested in the distribution of their size .",
    "so instead of keeping track of the weight of each detailed connected component , we can as well give all components of a given size the same weight , namely the average weight given by the original model for components of that size .",
    "now , to the precise definition .",
    "choose parameters @xmath272 and define an effective weight @xmath273 for any connected graph @xmath93 of size @xmath85 , and assume multiplicativity , so that for an arbitrary graph @xmath274 where @xmath185 is the number of components of size @xmath85 of @xmath93",
    ". if we trade @xmath275 for @xmath276 , we multiply the weight @xmath277 by a trivial factor @xmath278 so we shall assume that the @xmath275 s are normalized by @xmath279 ( the special case @xmath280 would need a separate treatment ) .",
    "define the corresponding effective weight @xmath281 , where the sum is over all graphs on the same vertex set as @xmath0 whose edge set is a subset of that of @xmath0 .",
    "note that contrary to the weight @xmath282 , the weight @xmath283 does in general depend on the detailed structure of the graph , and not only on the sizes of connected components .",
    "our interest however is in the distribution of sizes of connected component of graphs of large size @xmath192 sampled using the weight @xmath284 .",
    "following the same steps as for the original model , we find that this distribution can be obtained in the thermodynamic limit from tree generating functions @xmath285 and @xmath286 satisfying the very same coupled equations eqs.([eq : mainu],[eq : mainw],[eq : mainuw ] ) as the original @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the coefficients of @xmath285 are very simple in terms of @xmath272 because all components of the same size have the same weight , and by caley s theorem there are @xmath287 trees on @xmath85 vertices .",
    "hence @xmath288 .",
    "hence if one sets @xmath289 where the sum is over trees of size @xmath85 , the effective model has the same component size distribution as the original one .    for all these reasons",
    ", we shall remove in the sequel the superscript @xmath290 from @xmath285 and @xmath286 , even if we sometimes keep the distinction between the weights @xmath2 and @xmath5 and the effective weights @xmath282 and @xmath284 .",
    "accordingly , we shall analyse eqs.([eq : mainu],[eq : mainw],[eq : mainuw ] ) , which involve only the component size distribution , without making explicitly the distinction between the original model and the effective model .",
    "we return to the finite @xmath8 arbitrary @xmath222 case to start the argument .",
    "as @xmath291 is , modulo an overall multiplicative factor , the total weight of connected graphs of size @xmath85 , we infer from eq.([eq:1expform ] ) that the mean number of connected components on @xmath85 vertices is @xmath292 taking into account that when @xmath293 , @xmath294 , we find that in the dilute regime , for fixed @xmath85 and @xmath295 , @xmath296 and @xmath297 so that @xmath298 as expected , in this regime only trees contribute thermodynamically to the finite components .    from these equations for the abundance of connected component of each size",
    ", we can easily derive a percolation criterion .",
    "indeed , by construction , @xmath299 , but what about the approximate sum @xmath300 for each fixed @xmath85 and @xmath301 , the @xmath302 term is a good approximation to @xmath303 , but there is problem of inversion of limits .",
    "physically , the approximate sum counts the fraction of points in components of finite size , so it is @xmath304 .",
    "if we assume that @xmath6 is analytic at small @xmath117 , then @xmath305 is analytic and small at small @xmath206 and @xmath7 is analytic and small at small @xmath246 .",
    "moreover , @xmath306 is an increasing function of @xmath206 at small @xmath206 . from eq.([eq : mainw ] ) , we infer that @xmath307 or equivalently , @xmath308",
    ". then @xmath309 for small enough @xmath206 .",
    "however , it may happen that as a function of @xmath206 , @xmath310 is non monotonic .",
    "there may be a value @xmath311 such that @xmath306 increases in the interval @xmath312 $ ] but then starts to decrease , so that @xmath313 in some interval strictly containing @xmath312 $ ] .",
    "one could build models where @xmath314 has several oscillations , but in the sequel , we concentrate on the first . for a given @xmath206 , denote by @xmath315 the small solution to the equation @xmath316 .",
    "then we obtain the more general result that finite components occupy a fraction @xmath317 of the sites in the system . if @xmath318 , something else than finite components , in fact on general grounds one single giant component , occupies a fraction @xmath319 vertices .",
    "thus , the percolation criterion is that @xmath320 is maximum at @xmath321 .",
    "so the transition point is when @xmath322 the first two terms yield simply the true average connectivity @xmath323 , it would be nice to have a direct physical interpretation of the third term @xmath324 .",
    "this percolation criterion is expressed solely in terms of the free energy as a function of @xmath206 .",
    "but it can also be related to analytic properties of @xmath7 .",
    "indeed , the relevant saddle point equation is @xmath325 .",
    "as @xmath206 approaches @xmath311 , @xmath306 reaches a maximum , so that the @xmath306 derivative of @xmath326 has to get large , diverging at @xmath327 .",
    "if @xmath311 is finite , this means that @xmath7 and @xmath328 are finite at @xmath329 , but @xmath330 is infinite .",
    "if the coefficients of @xmath7 are non negative , this means that @xmath331 is the radius of convergence of @xmath7 . from @xmath331 , we recover @xmath311 itself by the general saddle point equation @xmath325 .",
    "suppose now ( we shall soon argue that this is true in many cases including interesting ones ) that even if @xmath331 is the radius of convergence of @xmath7 , the function @xmath6 is not singular at @xmath332 .",
    "hence @xmath6 allows to compute the free energy @xmath305 and show that it is analytic in some interval strictly containing @xmath311 . from that point of view , we observe that the saddle point equations imply that @xmath333 from which the percolation criterion , i.e. the determination of the maximum of @xmath306 becomes @xmath334 in the same spirit , the true average connectivity can be expressed as @xmath335 .    in general ,",
    "if @xmath6 has nonegative coefficients and eq.([eq : percoy * ] ) has a solution strictly within the disc of convergence , one can go through the above argument in the reverse order to prove the existence of a percolation transition with the announced characteristics .",
    "this is the case for instance if @xmath6 is an entire function with nonnegative coefficients , or more generally if @xmath6 is function with nonnegative coefficients such that @xmath336 is unbounded when the argument approaches the radius of convergence .",
    "it is worth to observe that if the @xmath117 expansion of @xmath6 has nonnegative coefficients , then the same is true of the @xmath246 expansion of @xmath7 . indeed , from eq.([eq : mainuw ] ) and the corresponding saddle point equation we infer that @xmath337 .",
    "hence as functions of @xmath246 , @xmath7 and @xmath220 have the same singular points , and @xmath338 expand both sides of this identity to see that @xmath339 and that @xmath340 is a polynomial in @xmath341 with nonnegative coefficients .    in the case of our original model , the situation is more tricky . we know by construction that the @xmath246 expansion of @xmath7 has nonnegative coefficients , but to ensure the existence of a dilute regime , the same can not be true in general of @xmath6 . in the sequel , we shall see that in perturbation theory at any finite order , we are in the following situation : the coefficients of @xmath6 may be negative , but nevertheless @xmath342 is analytic ( in fact a polynomial ) and positive in a interval strictly containing @xmath90 and a solution of eq.([eq : percoy * ] ) . then our previous arguments can be made rigorous and there is a ( perturbative ) percolation transition with the announced characteristics .",
    "we do not know if this argument can be extended outside the realm of perturbation theory .",
    "the numerical simulations are encouraging , but the behaviour of some perturbative series is puzzling . before discussing that , let us consider three simple but significant examples .",

    "but this does not prevent us from finding and analysing correctly the @xmath373 transition , because it occurs strictly before the @xmath282 transition .",

    "it is plain that the detailed structure of @xmath0 is relevant , and not simply the size of its connected components . on the other hand ,",

    "we have introduced an auxiliary model whose tree generating function @xmath6 was expected to present better convergence properties than the original one @xmath7 .",
    "the free energy @xmath305 in the large @xmath8 limit has been determined and a percolation transition has been established by means of an effective model : the percolation criterion is given by an equation , either on @xmath305 or on @xmath6 .",
    "we also have formul for the degree distributions .    on the basis of these general results we give explicit formul for the above quantities in the particular case where all parameters but one vanish .",
    "these perturbative results raise some crucial questions .",
    "indeed , we hope that the thermodynamical model makes sense for @xmath473 but that @xmath474 has to be discarded because it gives too much weight to strongly connected configurations and can not be treated like a diluted , tree - like , regime .",
    "in fact , up to sixth order , it is not so clear that the series for @xmath475 is actually convergent for negative @xmath462 , because its general term increases very fast . however , as suggested by the fifth and sixth terms , we hope that the following terms may all be negative , the series hence being possibly summable when @xmath473 . this interpretation is supported by the form of the perturbative expansion ( [ cperc ] ) of the physical connectivity parameter @xmath391 , which seems much better behaved , with negative coefficients for orders > 0 .",
    "we also have computed the molloy - reed criterion , which does not give an appropriate description of the percolation transition in this model .",
    "the @xmath462 expansion of @xmath476 seems to present the same pathology as @xmath475 .",
    "a possibility is that this series is indeed divergent for negative @xmath462 : the equation @xmath477 may not admit any solution in @xmath206 as soon as @xmath473 .",
    "another possibility is that , just as for @xmath475 the series may stop to alternate at higher orders .",
    "anyway , it would be desirable to determine a class of models for which the molloy - reed criterion is valid , and we believe that a minimal requirement may be a kind of locality .",
    "indeed , the molloy - reed criterion concentrates on the first two moments of the degree distribution , which are local quantities in the sense that @xmath417 can be computed as soon as the immediate environment of each vertex is known , independently of how the vertices are connected to each other . even in the simple model that we used to illustrate perturbation theory",
    ", this information is not sufficient to compute the weight of a graph : one must also know the immediate environment of the first neighbours of each vertex",
