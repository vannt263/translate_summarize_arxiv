    "there has been a good deal of recent experimental activity involved with measurement of the electric and magnetic polarizabilities of the nucleon , labeled @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively . as a result there now exist reasonably precise values for both the proton and the neutron @xcite @xmath3 above and hereafter all polarizabilities are quoted in units of @xmath4 @xmath5 . for the proton ,",
    "the first error is the combined statistical and systematic uncertainty based on combining the results of several experiments , and the second represents an estimated theoretical error based on the model dependence in the extraction of the polarizabilities from the compton scattering cross sections @xcite . for the neutron ,",
    "the first error is statistical and the second is systematic .",
    "while there remain nonnegligible experimental uncertainties , it appears likely that the neutron and proton magnetic polarizabilities are nearly identical while the electric polarizability of the neutron is slightly larger than that of the proton .",
    "the former result is not unexpected .",
    "however , the latter is somewhat of a surprise , at least in the context of a simple nonrelativistic valence quark model for the nucleon . in such a model ,",
    "the polarizabilities are given by @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 where q is 1 for the proton and 0 for the neutron .",
    "( [ eq : pol0 ] ) the sum rule component , which is usually called the paramagnetic polarizability , receives its most important contribution from the delta intermediate state , which is an isovector excitation and therefore contributes equally to the neutron and proton .",
    "one finds , including only this contribution @xcite @xmath9 the term @xmath10 , which is usually called the diamagnetic polarizability , can be estimated within a simple nonrelativistic valence constituent quark model , with hamiltonian @xmath11 resulting in @xcite @xmath12 such an approach is clearly unrealistic .",
    "indeed in such a picture the nucleon and delta are degenerate and the neutron has zero charge radius . however , if a spin - spin interaction is included these problems can be ameliorated but eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltabeta ] ) is only slightly affected@xcite : @xmath13 thus we anticipate @xmath14 combining eq .",
    "( [ eq : beta0 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : delbeta ] ) , we find @xmath15 in reasonable accord with experiment .",
    "however , this agreement should not be overemphasized , as the delta is only the most important of a large number of possible intermediate states and the use of a simple valence quark model is also open to question .",
    "what _ is _ a problem is the electric polarizability in this simple model , for which the recoil contribution is given by has an additional contribution @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the anomalous magnetic moment @xcite .",

    "( [ eq : pol0 ] ) gives@xcite @xmath19 where we have used a closure approximation and an average nucleon excitation energy of @xmath20 600 mev .",
    "the equality between the neutron and proton values is a result of charge symmetry , which requires that the valence quark excitations lead to identical excited states and p , n matrix elements .",
    "the precise value of the sum , which is difficult to calculate , then cancels out when we take the difference @xmath21 this expectation , however , is in strong opposition to the experimental indication that @xmath22    in fact , this difficulty is just another example of a well - known problem with valence quark models for the structure of the nucleon : namely , chiral symmetry is badly broken in such models because of the omission of mesonic degrees of freedom . by including only valence quark excitations in the sum over intermediate states , we are forced into the conclusion that the electric polarizability of the proton exceeds that of the neutron , in direct disagreement with experiment . in fact , it is well known that in the threshold region , the pion photoproduction on the nucleon is primarily nonresonant and that the cross section on the neutron is about 30% larger than that on the proton , a result which can easily be understood from a consideration of the effective dipole moment of the @xmath23n system @xcite .",
    "similar considerations lead us to expect that @xmath24 for the neutron will exceed that for the proton .",
    "this qualitative idea is supported in part by a calculation in the context of the cloudy bag model @xcite , where it was shown that both the electric and the diamagnetic polarizabilities are dominated by the polarization of the pion cloud relative to the quark core and have very little contribution from the polarization of the core itself .",
    "this would lead one to expect the neutron electric polarizability to exceed that of the proton , although a definitive quantitative calculation in that model is not possible .",
    "a reasonable estimate _ is _ possible in chiral perturbation theory , where the only degrees are freedom that matter are pionic , and a recent one - loop calculation yields results in reasonable agreement with experiment@xcite @xmath25 however , here too a rigorous evaluation is not available , as inclusion of important contributions such as the delta are two - loop in character and are outside the present calculational framework @xcite .",
    "we conclude then that a simple valence quark picture of the nucleon is in disagreement with experiment and that inclusion of meson cloud effects is _ required _ in order to understand the result that @xmath26 .",
    "this finding is similar to that in the interpretation of the @xmath27 matrix element , which also vanishes in a valence quark model but can be understood qualitatively by inclusion of a kaon cloud via @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "however , a reliable calculation of the polarizability and of the strangeness content in this fashion is not possible .",
    "instead we follow a completely different approach , that of dispersion relations . on the one hand",
    ", this technique is capable of complete rigor in that the relations depend only on unitarity and certain analytic properties of the compton scattering amplitudes . on the other hand , it is semi - phenomenological in that the evaluation of the dispersion integrals requires as input either experimental data or some reasonable theoretical _ ansatz _ when the required data are not available . in the next section",
    "we will present our results on the evaluation of the so - called backward dispersion relation for @xmath29 .",
    "then we show how this dispersion relation can be used to calculate the contribution of the polarizability of the pion to that of the nucleon .",
