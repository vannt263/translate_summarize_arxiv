    "loop quantum gravity is being explored in model situations of increasing complexity .",
    "there has been steady advance in treating homogeneous cosmologies @xcite , an area of activity that has come to be known as loop quantum cosmology .",
    "there has also been progress in spherical symmetry in vacuum @xcite .",
    "however , in all these cases one did not have to face the `` problem of dynamics '' , i.e. dealing with the non - lie algebra of constraints of general relativity .",
    "in homogeneous cosmologies there is only one constraint and it therefore has a trivial algebra . in spherical symmetry special gauges were chosen that resulted in an abelian algebra . in this paper",
    "we would like to study spherically symmetric gravity coupled to a spherically symmetric scalar field using loop quantum gravity techniques .",
    "it is not known in this situation how to formulate the problem in a way that one ends up with a lie algebra of constraints .",
    "a total gauge fixing was introduced by unruh @xcite , but it leads to a non - local expression for the hamiltonian . here",
    "we will fix partially the gauge to eliminate the diffeomorphism constraint in order to simplify things .",
    "this still leads to a hamiltonian constraint that has a non - lie poisson bracket with itself , involving structure functions . to treat this problem",
    "we will use the `` uniform discretization '' technique @xcite . we will introduce a variational technique adapted to the minimization of the master constraint ( in the context of uniform discretizations one should probably refer to it as `` master operator '' since it only vanishes in the continuum limit ) . in the case that zero is in the kernel of the master constraint the technique yields the correct physical state in model situations .",
    "the inclusion of scalar fields in spherical symmetry opens a rich set of possibilities to be studied including the formation of black holes , critical collapse , the emergence of hawking radiation , among others . here",
    "we will have much more modest goals : to see how the complete theory approximates the vacuum state of the scalar field living on a flat space - time .",
    "an outstanding problem in a full quantum gravity treatment involving matter fields is the emergence of a vacuum state for the fields and what relation it may have to the ordinary fock vacuum of quantum field theory in curved space - time .",
    "we will apply the variational technique in the case of spherically symmetric gravity coupled to a scalar field and show that it yields a vacuum state that is closely related to the fock one .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in section ii we review the classical theory . in section iii",
    "we discuss the quantization of a spherical scalar field in a classical flat space - time in order to have something to compare with the full case . in section",
    "iv we study the full quantization of gravity and the scalar field , using a variational technique to minimize the master constraint .",
    "we end with a discussion .",
    "spherically symmetric gravity with the ashtekar new variables has been studied in detail in @xcite and @xcite . here",
    "we present only a brief summary .",
    "one assumes that the topology of the spatial manifold is of the form @xmath0 .",
    "we will choose a radial coordinate @xmath1 and study the theory in the range @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "the invariant connection can be written as , @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are real arbitrary functions on @xmath6 , the @xmath7 are generators of @xmath8 , for instance @xmath9 where @xmath10 are the pauli matrices or rigid rotations thereof .",
    "the invariant triad takes the form , @xmath11 where again , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are functions on @xmath6 .    as discussed in our recent paper@xcite and originally by bojowald and swiderski@xcite , it is best to make several changes of variables to simplify things and improve asymptotic behaviors .",
    "it is also useful to gauge fix the diffeomorphism constraint to simplify the model as much as possible",
    ". it would be too lengthy and not particularly useful to go through all the steps here .",
    "it suffices to notice that one is left with two pairs of canonical variables @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and that they are related to the traditional canonical variables in spherical symmetry @xmath18 by @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the momentum canonically conjugate to @xmath24 .    in terms of these variables the diffeomorphism and hamiltonian constraints for gravity minimally coupled to a massless scalar field are @xcite , @xmath25 + \\frac{p_\\phi^2}{2 \\sqrt{|e^x|}e^\\varphi } + \\frac{(|e^x|)^{3/2 } ( \\phi')^2}{2 e^\\varphi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and since the variables are gauge invariant there is no gauss law .",
    "we have taken the immirzi parameter equal to one .",
    "we now proceed to partially fix the gauge by choosing @xmath26 ( @xmath27 in terms of the metric variables ) .",
    "one can solve the diffeomorphism constraint for @xmath17 , @xmath28 which yields the hamiltonian constraint for the partially gauge fixed model as , @xmath29 \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{p_\\phi^2}{2 x e^\\varphi } + \\frac{x^3 ( \\phi')^2}{2 e^\\varphi } -k_\\varphi p_\\phi \\phi'.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we now rescale the lagrange multiplier @xmath30 , the rescaled hamiltonian constraint is , @xmath31 where @xmath32    this form of the hamiltonian constraint allows an easy identification of the required boundary term if one assumes asymptotically flat conditions . the total hamiltonian is given by , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the rescaled lapse @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the boundary term at the asymptotic region @xmath37 . integrating by parts we get @xmath38 the boundary term @xmath39 has been introduced in order to ensure that m is a constant and @xmath40 the proper time in the asymptotic region .",
    "this is the standard boundary term in the spherically symmetric case .",
    "@xmath41 is the space time mass while the schwarzschild radius is given by @xmath42 . in the case of a space time with a black hole the radial coordinate is given by @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath41 is a dirac observable . in the case of weak fields",
    "therefore , so is the integral from @xmath44 to @xmath45 of @xmath46 that we shall cal @xmath47 . even in presence of black holes",
    "@xmath47 is an observable if the black hole is isolated .",
    "we will treat @xmath47 as an energy in order to define the vacuum and the excited states of the theory in the case of interest in this paper , weak fields without the presence of black holes .",
    "since we wish to understand in which way loop quantum gravity recovers results from ordinary quantum field theory in curved spacetime , we would like to outline some of those results for later comparison . if the space - time is flat it is convenient to fix the gauge @xmath48 to obtain explicitly the background metric in the usual spherical coordinates . in this case",
    "one solves @xmath49 one gets that @xmath50 . solving the evolution equation yields the lagrange multiplier and",
    "one recovers the full flat space - time metric .",
    "the matter portion of the hamiltonian constraint becomes , @xmath51 the evolution equation obtained from this hamiltonian corresponds to spherical waves , @xmath52 this can be solved by separation of variables , @xmath53 which corresponds to spherical waves that are regular at the origin .",
    "from hamilton s equation we can get an expression for @xmath54 , @xmath55    from the standard commutation relations , @xmath56= i\\delta(x - y)$ ] , one gets the @xmath57= \\delta(\\omega-\\omega')$ ] .",
    "one can proceed to define a vacuum state @xmath58 as the state that is annihilated by @xmath59 .",
    "if one evaluates the expectation value of @xmath46 on the vacuum state one finds that it has an ultraviolet divergence .",
    "the usual resolution of this problem is to introduce a cutoff .",
    "it should be noted that when one treats this problem in loop quantum gravity this type of divergence does not appear because the well defined objects are holonomies associated to finite paths . in our treatment",
    "this aspect is lost since we have gauge fixed the radial variable which therefore becomes a c - number . as we usually proceed",
    "when we use the uniform discretization technique , we regularize the expression by placing it on a lattice .",
    "we will discuss later on the issue of taking the lattice spacing to zero .",
    "we will assume that the radial direction is bounded with a spatial extent @xmath60 and consists of discrete points @xmath61 separated by a coordinate distance @xmath62 , and in particular we take @xmath61 as @xmath62 times an integer .",
    "we reinterpret the integrals as sums , dirac deltas as kronecker deltas , functional derivatives as partial derivatives , and partial derivatives in the radial directions as finite differences .",
    "specifically @xcite @xmath63 if the spatial direction is discrete , the associated momentum space is bounded with extent @xmath64 . to the first nontrivial order in in epsilon ,",
    "all formulae involving momenta @xmath65 are unchanged except that momentum integrals are now sums over a momentum space of finite extent .",
    "the expectation value of @xmath66 can be computed replacing the quantum version of the expressions given above for @xmath67 and @xmath68 in @xmath66 .",
    "computing the expectation value on the vacuum state one is only left with contributions proportional to @xmath69 . on the lattice the result may be approximated in the limit of large @xmath60 by the integral , @xmath70 the integral can be computed in closed form in terms of integral cosine functions .",
    "it is more useful to give an approximation for its value as an expansion in @xmath62 , @xmath71 the leading order in the energy density expansion is @xmath72 which has the correct dimensions for an energy density in one spatial dimension , since we are only considering the radial mode of the scalar field .    as in four dimensions ,",
    "the energy of the vacuum gives rise to a cosmological constant if one allows the field to back - react on gravity .",
    "the nature of this constant is different , however in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "first of all , notice that if one had started from four dimensional gravity with a cosmological constant and imposed spherical symmetry , one can view the model as a @xmath73 dimensional theory with a dilaton with a mass given by the four dimensional cosmological constant .",
    "that is , it does not produce a term that behaves like a cosmological constant in @xmath73 dimensions .",
    "the vacuum energy , by contrast produces a constant term in the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "second , notice that even in vacuum @xmath74 already has a constant term in it .",
    "so the energy of the vacuum essentially operates as a rescaling of that constant term , which in turn can be absorbed by a rescaling of the radial coordinate . in four dimensions ,",
    "if one chooses a planck scale cutoff it implies that the radius of curvature of space - time becomes of the order of planck length , which is clearly unphysical .",
    "in spherical symmetry the presence of the constant can be reabsorbed in a redefinition of the coordinates .",
    "this redefinition however , has consequences when one wishes to reinterpret the model as an approximation to a four dimensional space - time .",
    "the redefinition of the radial coordinate implies that the spheres do not have @xmath75 area anymore .",
    "the four dimensional universe modeled contains a topological defect , a `` global texture '' @xcite .",
    "notice that this immediately precludes taking the lattice spacing to zero , since already when the lattice spacing is of the order of @xmath76 one will have a solid deficit angle that exceeds @xmath77 and does not allow to interpret the model as a four dimensional space - time .",
    "there are two avenues to handle the situation : either one rescales the radial variable and accepts that the model approximates four dimensional space - times with ( large ) topological defects , or one can modify the two dimensional model by adding a constant to the hamiltonian constraint ( a cosmological constant in @xmath73 dimensional gravity ) .",
    "such a model will not stem from a dimensional reduction of four dimensional gravity , but upon quantization will turn out to approximate four dimensional spherical gravity around a flat background without a topological defect .",
    "we will take the first point of view and write the hamiltonian constraint as , @xmath78 where @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 is the vacuum energy density .",
    "we choose @xmath82 units .",
    "this rewriting of the constraint has the property that the expectation value of @xmath46 will be zero in the vacuum .",
    "we would like to write the master constraint based on the hamiltonian constraint of the model we introduced in the last section . although the discrete hamiltonian constraint fails to close a first class algebra , we have showed in @xcite that with the uniform discretization technique one can consistently treat the problem by minimizing the resulting master constraint . to write the master constraint at a quantum level we will polymerize the expression of the gravitational part of the constraint .",
    "we will not use a polymer representation in the scalar sector for simplicity and because we want to make contact with the usual treatments based on a fock quantization .",
    "it is known that the fock quantization for fields can be recovered from the polymer quantization @xcite .      here",
    "we will introduce a variational technique to minimize the master constraint .",
    "the technique is general , it is not restricted to the model we study in this paper .",
    "we start by considering a fiducial hilbert space @xmath83 in which the master constraint is a well defined self - adjoint operator",
    ". we will then use a variational technique to find approximations to the minimum value of the expectation value of the master constraint within this space . in many cases of interest ,",
    "the minimum expectation value will not be zero , but will be small ( the master constraint has units of action squared , so normally one would require it to be much smaller than @xmath84 , in order to have a good approximation of the physical space , in our units that translates into much smaller than one ) . as we will see in the examples ,",
    "the resulting quantum theory will therefore not reproduce exactly the symmetries of the continuum theory but it will approximate them , even at the quantum level .",
    "we will see that if zero is in the spectrum of the operator the corresponding eigenstates in many cases will be distributional with respect to the fiducial space we are considering .    to implement the variational method , we consider trial states in @xmath83 that are gaussians centered around the classical solution of the model of interest in phase space .",
    "that means that as functions of @xmath83 these will generically be gaussians times phase factors such that the resulting state is centered around the classical solution in both configuration variables and momenta .",
    "the states are parameterized by the values of the standard deviations of the gaussians in either configuration or momentum space .",
    "a caveat is that in gauge theories one may choose to work with a classical solution that is not in a completely determined gauge .",
    "such a solution will be a trajectory in phase space .",
    "such a trajectory will determine some of the canonical variables as functions of others , which will remain free .",
    "in that case one has to allow such variables to be free in the trial solution by considering gaussians centered around a value that is a free parameter .",
    "if one chooses to work with a classical solution in a completely specified gauge one just considers gaussians around the point in phase space represented by the classical solution of interest and extremizes the expectation value of the master constraint with respect to the standard deviations of the gaussians .",
    "it can happen that the extremum occurs as a limit in the parameter space in which case the resulting state does not belong in @xmath83 but in its dual ( after a suitable rescaling , it becomes a distribution ) .    before attacking the problem of interest , it is useful to see the technique we just described in action in a couple of simple examples .",
    "the first example we choose is a system with two degrees of freedom @xmath85 and @xmath86 , and two constraints @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the total hamiltonian for the system is @xmath89 with @xmath90 lagrange multipliers .",
    "the states annihilated by the constraints are trivial and given by the distribution @xmath91 .",
    "we fix a gauge @xmath92 . fixing the gauge is not needed in a simple model like this , but may be a necessity to simplify things in more complicated models .",
    "so we will choose a gauge fixing here to show that in the end the process loses all information about the gauge fixing and recovers the correct physical state .",
    "this requires fixing the lagrange multipliers so there is only one ( @xmath93 ) left and the total hamiltonian becomes @xmath94 .",
    "the conjugate variable to the gauge fixing , @xmath95 is strongly zero .",
    "we start with a two parameter family of states in @xmath83 choosing as configuration variables @xmath96 and @xmath97 , @xmath98 with @xmath99 an arbitrary parameter associated with the fact that the variable @xmath100 is pure gauge .",
    "one could choose to work in a completely gauge fixed solution in which @xmath100 is zero , in that case there is no need to introduce the parameter @xmath99 .",
    "the choice of this family of states is based on the fact that they describe wave - packets centered around the classical solutions of the constraints , @xmath92 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "we now define the master constraint @xmath103 and act on this space of states .",
    "the expectation value is , @xmath104 where @xmath105 are the standard deviations of the gaussians , @xmath106 taken to be positive .",
    "one therefore sees that the expectation value can not be zero for any finite value of the @xmath107 s .",
    "however , if one takes @xmath108 and @xmath109 then in the limit @xmath110 , @xmath111 .",
    "the states @xmath112 become , @xmath113 and their fourier transform @xmath114    these states are normalized in @xmath83 but they vanish ( in the sense of distributions ) in the limit @xmath110 .",
    "they need to be rescaled in order to end up with well defined distribution on some suitable subspace of @xmath83 .",
    "so the physical states would be @xmath115 notice that the parameter @xmath99 is free at the end of the process since it corresponds to the value of a variable that is pure gauge in this model .",
    "there is an additional element that the above example does not capture and we would like to discuss . when we apply this technique in situations of interest , we will be discretizing the theories we analyze .",
    "usually , discretization turns first class constraints into second class ones .",
    "the uniform discretization procedure tells us that we do not need to concern ourselves with the second class nature of the constraints ( for a discussion see @xcite ) .",
    "we can still consider the master constraint and seek the minimization of its eigenvalues , but the presence of second class constraints in the discrete theory usually implies that the minimum eigenvalue of the master constraint will not be zero .",
    "the best one can hope for is that it will be small and the resulting quantum theory will approximate the symmetries of the theory one started with .",
    "this is a point of view that has been held as natural for some time in the context of quantum gravity , where one expects that some level of fundamental discreteness will emerge .",
    "we would like to illustrate this with a modification of the previous example . instead of taking @xmath87 and @xmath88 as the constraints we will take @xmath116 and @xmath88 with @xmath117 a small parameter ( in realistic theories the small parameter is related to the lattice spacing in the discretization ) .",
    "we will still take the same set of @xmath118 as before , that is , for the trial solution we have chosen gaussians centered around classical solutions of the gauge theory where the anomalous term vanishes .",
    "we do this because one usually knows solutions to the continuum theory one wishes to approximate ( e.g. flat space or the schwarzschild solution in the case of gravity ) whereas the discrete theories have complicated solutions that usually can not be treated in analytic form .",
    "the master constraint now becomes , @xmath119 and using the same ansatz ( [ 26 ] ) for the states one finds that @xmath120 we would like to identify a limit in the variables @xmath121 such that this quantity vanishes . as was to be expected ,",
    "this is not possible .",
    "we can attempt to find values of the parameters @xmath121 and @xmath99 that minimize this expression .",
    "the result is @xmath122 and @xmath123 and @xmath124 . which yields @xmath125 .",
    "the state is , @xmath126    it is interesting to compare this state and the corresponding expectation value of @xmath127 obtained from our variational technique with the exact minimum of this model .",
    "a naive analysis would tell us that the minimum corresponds to an exact eigenstate with zero eigenvalue for @xmath127 .",
    "however , that solution is not well behaved .",
    "it is known that one can find solutions of the master constraint that do not solve the constraints if one does not impose regularity in the solutions found @xcite .",
    "the master constraint is an operator in the hilbert space and one can analyze its spectral resolution .",
    "the spurious solutions do not belong in the spectral resolution of the master constraint . in this case",
    "one can solve exactly the eigenvalue problem @xmath128 .",
    "the solutions with minimum eigenvalue are of the form @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the fundamental state of the hamiltonian of a harmonic oscillator in the momentum representation .",
    "the minimum eigenvalue for such exact solution is @xmath117 ( compare with the variational one in which the eigenvalue was slightly higher @xmath131 ) .",
    "it is also interesting to note that if instead of choosing the gauge @xmath92 we had chosen @xmath132 and proceeded with the variational technique , one obtains the exact state directly .",
    "this illustrates that the method approximates well the state of interest in situations where zero is not in the kernel of the master constraint .",
    "the solution that minimizes the master constraint admits a very simple interpretation that shows that the uniform discretization of the theory with the anomalous term @xmath117 small but non - vanishing , approximately reproduces the invariances of the theory with first class constraints @xmath133 . in fact",
    "@xmath134 and @xmath135 are gauge variables and the physical space is independent of these variables . the physical state is constant in @xmath134 and @xmath135 . for a small but non vanishing alpha",
    "the physical states are independent of @xmath134 and weakly dependent on @xmath135 .",
    "a final comment is that in this case the parameter @xmath99 , which was not determined in the case with first class constraints , gets determined here .",
    "that is , in the case where @xmath99 was associated with an exact gauge symmetry , the minimization of the master constraint was insensitive to the value of @xmath99 . in the case where the constraints are second class and we do not get zero as minimum of the master constraint there is some dependence on @xmath99 , but it is weak , since the term in the master constraint is @xmath136 and @xmath117 is small ( in the quantum state one has approximately @xmath137 ) .",
    "the theory where one does not exactly annihilate the master constraint only has approximate gauge symmetries and therefore has slightly `` preferred '' gauges from the point of view of minimizing the master constraint .",
    "let us now consider the complete hamiltonian constraint .",
    "we wish to discretize it and to polymerize the gravitational variables .",
    "the hamiltonian gets rescaled in the discretization @xmath138 , .",
    "we also rescale the expression multiplying the continuum hamiltonian constraint times @xmath139 .",
    "the resulting discrete expression is , @xmath140    we need to construct the master constraint .",
    "since the hamiltonian is a density of weight one , we define the master constraint associated with the hamiltonian constraint in the full theory as , @xmath141 or , in terms of the variables of the model , up to a constant factor , @xmath142 and in the discretized theory @xmath143 with @xmath144 the constant @xmath145 must be introduced so that @xmath146 is dimensionless with @xmath82 , one could use @xmath147 instead of it . it is convenient to rescale the hamiltonian constraint by @xmath148 .",
    "this does not change the density weight .",
    "if one does not rescale things it turns out @xmath127 is proportional to @xmath149 . in the polymer representation",
    "this implies that the vacuum is the `` zero loop '' state , which is degenerate ( it corresponds to zero volume space - times ) . to eliminate this unphysical possibility",
    "one exploits the fact that the hamiltonian constraint is defined up to a factor given by a scalar function of the canonical variables without changing the first class nature of the classical constraint algebra .",
    "the rescaling factor in the discrete theory after the gauge fixing is @xmath150 .",
    "so ( [ 33 ] ) has to be multiplied times that factor when constructing the master constraint ( [ 36 ] ) .",
    "let us focus on the matter portion of the hamiltonian , we will write it as , @xmath151    the master constraint can be written as , @xmath152,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath153 to economize space , we will not give the classical expressions for the coefficients , since they can be readily obtained from the quantum expressions .    in order to quantize the master constraint we need to choose a factor ordering .",
    "the expression of the master constraint is a sum of symmetric operators consisting of polynomials in @xmath154 and @xmath155 , @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "we choose a factor ordering with the factors of @xmath154 are distributed symmetrically to the right and the left of the factors of @xmath155 .",

    "reverting to the discrete theory , it reads , @xmath221 the procedure to compute the expectation value of the other terms in ( [ masterconstraint2 ] ) is exactly the same , but the size of the expressions involved is quite large .",
    "we will not display them here for reasons of space .",
    "the result for the expectation value of the integrand of the master constraint is , @xmath222 we have assumed @xmath223 with @xmath224 of order unity and we have neglected terms @xmath225 .",
    "we have assumed @xmath107 to be independent of @xmath1 in order to simplify the above expression , which otherwise becomes too large .",
    "experiments we have carried out suggest that allowing variations in @xmath1 leads to the same minimum value of @xmath107 approximately independent of @xmath1 .",
    "we would like to study the minimum of the master constraint as a function of @xmath224 for different choices of @xmath226 .",
    "notice that we have assumed @xmath224 to be of order one .",
    "one can change that by varying the ansatz for @xmath107 including other powers @xmath226 different than 2 .",
    "we have carried out such experiments .",
    "the results can be summarized as follows .",
    "cm the master constraint is very small , of the order of @xmath227 ( we are using units in which @xmath228 is one and therefore the master constraint is dimensionless).,height=188 ]    in figure [ figure1 ] we show the value of the master constraint as a function of @xmath62 ( in centimeters ) and for @xmath229 and @xmath230 .",
    "varying @xmath224 while keeping it of order one changes little the shape of the curve .",
    "we see that in the approximation studied the theory does not appear to have a continuum limit , but we see that the master constraint quickly drops to zero for lattice spacings larger than planck scale .",
    "although the figure suggests that the master constraint drops even further for larger lattice spacings , the approximation in which we have handled expressions ( in which we have neglected higher powers of @xmath226 ) is inadequate for large values of @xmath62 and the master constraint very likely will increase its value for large values of @xmath62 .",
    "so there exists a genuine preferred value of @xmath62 that minimizes the master constraint .",
    "even so , the approximation should be reliable up to values of @xmath231 cm and for such values the master constraint is of the order of @xmath227 , so one sees that this is a regime where one approximates the continuum theory very well .",
    "we have explored other ranges of @xmath107 s ( with different powers of @xmath226 ) .",
    "the observation is the following . for lower powers than three we get a curve that looks similar to the one shown in the figure , but that grows faster as one approaches smaller lattice spacings and therefore the minimum occurs farther away from the planck scale . for powers",
    "higher than @xmath232 one violates the approximation that @xmath233 is small and the expressions we derived are not valid . from these considerations and an analysis of the powers involved ,",
    "we conclude that the minimum for the master constraint is achieved for a power of @xmath226 in @xmath107 close to two and @xmath234 .",
    "an interesting speculation is that if the minimum of the master constraint happens in the range mentioned , the cosmological constant , which goes as @xmath235 would not be of planck scale but several orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "another observation of interest is to note what would have happened if instead of choosing the state peaked around the flat metric ( with a topological defect ) one would have chosen the `` loop quantum gravity vacuum '' , i.e. a state with zero loops which corresponds to a degenerate metric @xmath236 .",
    "such a state annihilates the matter hamiltonian in the loop representation and has zero volume",
    ". it would be disturbing if this state yielded a lower value for the master constraint than the state we constructed , since it would imply that degenerate geometries dominate .",
    "this is not the case , as can be easily seen .",
    "for such a state all expectation values ( [ 68])-([74 ] ) vanish .",
    "one can check that the expectation value of the master constraint is , @xmath237 that is , the result is very large .",
    "for @xmath238 it goes as @xmath239 , the size of the universe in planck lengths .",
    "therefore these degenerate states are heavily suppressed .",
    "we have studied spherically symmetric gravity coupled to a spherically symmetric scalar field using loop quantum gravity techniques .",
    "the problem has a non - lie algebra of constraints and we used the `` uniform discretization '' technique to treat the dynamics .",
    "we used a variational technique to minimize the discrete master constraint . with the trial states proposed",
    ", we were not able to reach a zero eigenvalue for the master constraint , that is , the theory does not seem to have a quantum continuum limit .",
    "the lowest eigenstate of the master constraint has the form of a direct product of a fock vacuum for the scalar field and gaussian states centered around flat space - time for the gravitational variables .",
    "although the theory does not have a continuum limit , it approximates general relativity well for small values of the lattice separation , which in turn regularizes the cosmological constant .",
    "the lattice treatment we have performed diverges when one takes the continuum limit .",
    "the reader may wonder why loop quantum gravity has failed to act as the `` natural regulator of matter quantum field theories '' as claimed , for instance in @xcite .",
    "the problem arises with the gauge fixing of the diffeomorphism constraint that we performed at the classical level .",
    "this leads us to variables that have the structure of a bohr compactification in the `` transverse '' @xmath240 direction , but the variable in the radial direction is a c - number and therefore is not dynamical and has continuous character .",
    "there is no chance therefore that loop quantum gravity based on this gauge fixing could regulate the short distance behavior , which is responsible for the emergence of the cosmological constant . to tackle this issue one would have to allow both the diffeomorphism and hamiltonian constraint to remain in the theory .",
    "the calculational complexity would increase importantly , since one will have to regulate the master constraint in such a way that the resulting states have remnants of diffeomorphism invariance in the discrete theory .",
    "this has been successfully accomplished with uniform discretizations in the husain  kucha model @xcite , but the complexity there was considerably reduced by the lack of a hamiltonian constraint .",
    "it is worthwhile noticing that even if one allowed loop quantum gravity to regulate matter in the proposed way , the resulting cosmological constant is likely to be finite but still very large with respect to the current observed value .",
    "the present paper is a first exploration of a difficult problem , carried out with several assumptions and limitations that we have outlined in the text .",
    "future work will include relaxing the assumption that one has a fock vacuum for the scalar field and treating both the gravitational and scalar variables on the same footing with the variational technique for the master constraint . in this context",
    "it will be interesting to study the excited states of matter and study the modifications in dispersion relations for the matter fields due to the quantum geometry .",
    "this will definitely require considering trial states with correlations in the variational method , something we have not done here .",
    "one should also relax the gauge fixing of diffeomorphisms to see if the cosmological constant problem becomes better under control .",
    "other future directions would be to consider solutions centered around non - flat geometries , for instance , including a black hole with the aim of studying if the scalar field states involve hawking radiation .",
