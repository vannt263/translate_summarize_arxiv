    "recently , simulations of compressing turbulent plasma demonstrated a sudden dissipation mechanism , which may enable a new paradigm for fast ignition inertial fusion  @xcite .",
    "a plasma with initial ( turbulent ) flow is compressed on a timescale that is much faster than the dissipation time of the flow .",
    "this amplifies the turbulent kinetic energy ( tke ) in the flow , for an ideal gas with subsonic flows . in a very rapid three dimensional adiabatic compression the energy in the flow scales at the same rate as the temperature . as the temperature increases",
    ", the plasma viscosity , which starts small , grows , because it scales as @xmath0 .",
    "the viscosity first dissipates the smaller scales in the flow , which do not contain much energy .",
    "eventually , as the compression continues , the energy - containing ( largest ) scales become viscous , and at this time all the tke very suddenly dissipates into temperature . by initially putting most of the plasma energy in tke , it may be possible to keep the plasma comparatively cool up until the sudden dissipation event , at which point it would ignite fusion or produce a burst of x - rays  @xcite .    however , in addition to the temperature , the plasma charge state , @xmath1 , factors strongly into the viscosity , @xmath2 .",
    "laser and magnetically driven fusion experiments typically compress deuterium and tritium , with @xmath3 , so that , ignoring contaminants from the shell , the charge state is constant during the compression .",
    "in contrast , compression experiments designed to produce x - rays use a variety of higher @xmath1 materials , which increase in ionization state during the compression .",
    "this increase in ionization state has the effect of slowing the viscosity growth .",
    "consider , for example , a neon gas - puff z - pinch  @xcite that starts with @xmath4 ev and @xmath5 , and finishes with @xmath6 ev and @xmath7 .",
    "the temperature increase causes a growth in the viscosity by a factor of @xmath8 , while the ( mean ) ionization state growth reduces the viscosity by a factor of @xmath9 , drastically cutting the overall viscosity increase .    in the present work , as in ref .",
    "[    @mbox= cite@citenum @space@spacechar @super@kern    @open    @close @xcite    ] , we consider a plasma temperature that increases due to the 3d adiabatic compression of an ideal gas in a box of side length @xmath10 , going as @xmath11 .",
    "the ( mean ) ionization state , @xmath1 , is treated as having some dependence on @xmath10 ( i.e. , the amount of compression ) as well .",
    "this dependence is treated as fittable with some power , @xmath12 .",
    "then , defining @xmath13 , the viscosity can be written @xmath14 in this model , regarding the ionization state as a function of l is equivalent to regarding it as a function of t ( @xmath15 ) , because @xmath16 .",
    "ionization processes in z - pinch  @xcite and laser driven plasmas are not simply temperature dependent , depending on density and more complex processes ( e.g. shock dynamics ) . however ,",
    "if the ( mean ) ionization state for a given experiment can be reasonably fit to @xmath10 as described , then the net effect in the present model is that the overall temperature dependence of the viscosity can be treated as some power other than 5/2 .",
    "we expect @xmath17 , reflecting the assumption that the charge state increases under increasing compression ( or temperature ) .",
    "for a rough estimate of a possible value for @xmath18 and therefore @xmath19 , consider that the first 26 ionization states of krypton ( covering  13 ev - 1200 ev ) can be fit with @xmath20 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath21 , and @xmath22 . since the ionization state can be higher at a given temperature than one would predict purely based on comparing the temperature to the ionization energies , one expects based on this example that a wide range of @xmath19 is possible in experiments , possibly including negative values .",
    "note that , if the adiabatic index of the compression is smaller than the value of @xmath23 assumed here , this also weakens the scaling of the viscosity with compression , effectively lowering @xmath19 ( @xmath19 is defined so that @xmath24 ) .",
    "we consider initially turbulent plasma undergoing rapid , constant velocity , 3d isotropic compression and described by the same model as in davidovits and fisch  @xcite , but with general @xmath19 rather than @xmath25 .",
    "this model is described briefly in sec . [",
    "sec : model and energy ] , and a derivation is given in the appendix sec . [",
    "sec : derivation ] .",
    "we show that there will be an eventual sudden dissipation when @xmath26 . for identical initial condition ,",
    "starting viscosity , and compression velocity , lower @xmath19 cases show larger tke growth and later sudden dissipation ( when @xmath19 is still @xmath27 ) .",
    "additionally , lower @xmath19 cases can show tke growth under compression rates that would lead to the tke damping in higher @xmath19 cases .",
    "for @xmath28 , the tke reaches a statistical steady state under constant velocity compression , for any compression rate above a threshold which we determine .",
    "when @xmath29 , it seems there is no sudden dissipation , with the tke increasing indefinitely instead .",
    "there are a number of implications of these results .",
    "the plasma in magnetically driven  @xcite or laser driven  @xcite compressions can be turbulent .",
    "there can be substantial reduction in viscosity growth due to increasing ionization state for a gas - puff z - pinch .",
    "to the extent the turbulence generation mechanism(s ) of a given compression approach is insensitive to @xmath1 , the present results show that , for a fixed rapid compression rate , a larger increase in @xmath1 ( weaker viscosity growth ) is expected to correspond to larger tke growth .",
    "furthermore , increases in @xmath1 can make the difference between growing or decaying tke .",
    "note that while these gas - puff z - pinches appear to have substantial non - radial tke even at stagnation  @xcite , turbulence in the hot spot of ignition shots at the national ignition facility ( nif ) is expected to be dissipated by high viscosity  @xcite .",
    "the much higher temperatures in these hot spots create this high viscosity , but they are assisted by fuel of @xmath3 , to the extent it is not contaminated by mix .",
    "our results demonstrate that even moderate reductions in the effective power @xmath19 from @xmath30 can cause large differences in tke growth , and can determine whether for a given amount of compression ( @xmath31 ) one can reach the dissipation regime .",
    "the analysis in this work is carried out for 3d compressions , and as such is not strictly applicable to 2d compressions such as those in z - pinches . in a 2d compression , the relative scaling of the tke with compression , compared to the temperature is different ( if the temperature growth is still assumed to be adiabatic and isotropic , the latter now being a larger assumption , since the plasma is driven anisotropically ) .",
    "nevertheless , the intuition developed here may still be useful ; all else being equal , more ionization enhances tke growth under rapid compression by weakening the viscosity growth .",
    "the present work also neglects magnetic field effects , in line with other studies of turbulence in 3d compressions  @xcite .",
    "this , too , limits the applicability to z - pinch compressions , though there are also many instances in which the magnetic field need not dominate the dynamics in a z - pinch  @xcite .",
    "the evolving ionization state during compression may be exploitable to optimize tke growth before sudden dissipation , and to control the timing of the dissipation .",
    "if the ions in the compression become maximally ionized , then the viscosity change reverts to being dominated by temperature , while tke growth up to this point will be larger than without ionization .",
    "mixes of ion species open up a wide range of control possibilities for the viscosity dependence on compression , but also introduce other complications ( e.g. species separation ) , and are beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "however , the prospect of controlling ion charge state and thereby viscosity appears to enlarge considerably the parameter space of opportunities for optimizing both the energy and pulse length in a sudden dissipation resulting in x - ray emission .",

    "the wavenumber cutoff between these two regions is given by equality in eq .",
    "( [ eq : decrease_condition ] ) , @xmath73 the width of wavenumbers with a net forcing ( linearly ) is @xmath74 .",

    "the present model ignores many effects that do or may play an important role during compression of plasmas .",
    "the suggested @xmath28 cutoff between eventually dissipating and perpetually growing tke need not hold true in a more complete model .",
    "non - ideal equation of state effects are neglected .",
    "it should be noted that only constant velocity compressions were considered ; compressions with time - dependent velocities would also change the cutoff .",
    "boundary effects , which are ignored , would be expected to become increasingly important as the amount of compression increased .",
    "the manner in which the ionization is accounted for neglects , among other effects , the energy required to achieve the ionization .",
    "if this energy comes at the expense of the temperature , and the true rate of temperature increase is less than @xmath90 , this would alter @xmath19 , but the general idea remains the same .",
    "subsonic compressions have been assumed , which is not necessarily the case for current compression experiments , nor is it the regime in which schemes utilizing the sudden dissipation effect would likely be operated . because the compressions are subsonic , the feedback of the dissipated tke into the temperature is also neglected , which is expected to only make the sudden dissipation , once it happens , even more sudden .    as previously discussed , magnetic effects have also been neglected .",
    "although this may be reasonable for 3d compressions , and certain regimes of 2d z - pinch compressions , to expand the study for general 2d compression ( z - pinch ) applicability will require the inclusion of magnetic effects .",
    "the inclusion of magnetic fields through a magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) model will introduce a number of new considerations .",
    "if there is a strong background magnetic field , the plasma conditions can be highly anisotropic , and the intuition from the present discussion may be difficult to apply . with magnetic fields included , turbulent energy can be stored in fluctuations of the magnetic field , and turbulent dissipation can occur through the plasma diffusivity , @xmath91 . continuing to assume the incompressible limit ,",
    "then , in addition to the reynolds number , the magnetic reynolds number @xmath92 and the magnetic prandtl number @xmath93 are also important for characterizing any turbulence .",
    "the plasma magnetic diffusivity scales with ion charge state and plasma temperature as @xmath94 .",
    "then , the magnetic prandtl number has a temperature and charge state scaling of @xmath95 .",
    "the behavior of mhd turbulence is influenced by the relative values of @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 ; they affect whether magnetic fluctuations will grow ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , the saturated ratio of turbulent magnetic energy compared to kinetic energy , and the steady state ratio of viscous dissipation to dissipation through the magnetic diffusivity ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . from the considerations in the present work ,",
    "it is clear that , depending on the amount of ionization during compression , a range of behaviors for the dimensionless quantities is possible .",
    "considering the limit of no ionization , and assuming the scalings @xmath99 , one has that : the viscosity increases with compression ( and the reynolds number decreases ) , the magnetic diffusivity decreases ( and the magnetic reynolds number increases ) , and the magnetic prandtl number increases . at high magnetic prandtl number and large magnetic reynolds number ( but assuming the reynolds number is still large enough for turbulent flow ) ,",
    "the small scale dynamo is effective , so that magnetic perturbations can grow up quickly and saturate , while the ratio of kinetic dissipation to magnetic dissipation appears to grow large  @xcite .",
    "investigations of these effects are a subject of current research and debate , and are typically carried out in steady state , whereas the sudden dissipation effect relies on dynamics far from steady state . as such , specific investigations of mhd effects on sudden dissipation are needed before making predictions .    a simple model of the impact of radiation , the effects of which",
    "have been neglected in the preceding discussion , is included in the appendix sec .",
    "[ sec : radiation ] .",
    "this model consists of a temperature equation that includes mechanical heating and radiative cooling due to optically thin electron bremsstrahlung . with no radiation ,",
    "the mechanical heating gives the @xmath100 adiabatic temperature scaling .",
    "when the bremsstrahlung is included , it is shown that the temperature can still track closely with the adiabatic result for a large amount of the compression , provided the initial ratio of the radiation term to the mechanical heating term is very small . then , the results in the present work will not be significantly modified .",
    "the ratio of radiation term to mechanical heating term , @xmath101 , can be written as @xmath102 . for details , see appendix sec .",
    "[ sec : radiation ] . here",
    "@xmath103 is the compression time , @xmath104 the density , @xmath37 the temperature , @xmath105 the ion mass number , and @xmath1 the ion charge state .",
    "these considerations are a subset of the usual power balance requirements for inertial confinement experiments ( see , for example , lindl  @xcite ) . in both cases",
    ", it is desirable to operate in parameter regimes where the temperature increases under compression when radiation effects are included . from the perspective of radiation",
    ", the presence and quantity of the hydrodynamic motion does not modify the potential operating regimes as compared to compression schemes without hydrodynamic motion .",
    "the same will be true with the inclusion of line - radiation , important for high - z plasmas .",
    "however , the operating regimes where the temperature increases under compression will be modified by the turbulence in ( at least ) two ways that are neglected in this work .",
    "first , before any sudden dissipation event , there will be some level of viscous dissipation of hydrodynamic motion into temperature .",
    "when the hydrodynamic energy is large compared to the thermal energy , this heating may somewhat relax the operating regimes where the temperature increases under compression .",
    "on the other hand , a second neglected effect , turbulent heat transport , represents a cooling effect that opposes this heating effect .",
    "once the sudden dissipation event is triggered , in the supersonic case with the feedback of dissipated tke into temperature included , the temperature should rise rapidly .",
    "taking into account radiation will then be important for modeling the sudden dissipation event itself , which occurs over a small time interval so that the plasma volume hardly changes .    despite these deficiencies ,",
    "the present work serves to highlight the sensitivity of tke growth under compression to changes in the viscosity scaling with compression , in which ionization can play a strong role .",
    "thus , even modest contamination of a low - z plasma with higher - z constituents may have substantial hydrodynamic implications , as , say , atomic mix in an icf hotspot .",
    "finally , this sensitivity to the ionization state suggests that the possibilities for control of tke growth and sudden dissipation for x - ray production are now significantly expanded .",
    "this expansion of possibilities comes in part from the prospect of considering a wide range of ion - species mixes .",
    "although outside the scope of the present work , it can be anticipated that using a variety of mixtures could enable detailed and controlled shaping of the x - ray emission pulse .",
