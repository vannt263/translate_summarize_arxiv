    "however , the fwhm of its [ oiii ] emission is the lowest in the sample .",
    "this indicates that additional influences than mass must be important in determining the velocity width of the low - ionisation absorption .",
    "one such possible influence is of course outflows .",
    "another important reason for this may be the low impact parameter , which implies that a larger fraction of the gravitational potential is probed by the line - of - sight .",
    "we also observe here , as in @xcite , that the systems with the highest hi column densities have the smallest impact parameters .",
    "it would be interesting to carry out detailed comparisons of the quantities in table  [ compare ] with simulations , e.g. , similar to the works of @xcite and @xcite .    for the galaxy counterpart of the @xmath3 we can establish further properties : it is a compact ( @xmath27 kpc ) , strongly star - forming galaxy with a centroid 16.2 kpc away from the line - of - sight to the background qso .",
    "the galaxy photometry is well fitted by galaxy templates with ages up to several 100 myr .",
    "the ratio between the hi gas scale length of this dla galaxy , as measured by its impact parameter , and the light scale length , as measured by its half - light radii , is of order 10 as seen in previous cases of dla galaxy counterparts @xcite .",
    "this is very different from the situation in local galaxies , where the gas only extends up to a few times the extension of the light @xcite .",
    "our data are deep , but the @xmath28 dimming of surface brightness with redshift is a very strong effect .",
    "hence , an important question is whether the measured compact morphology is only due to central high surface brightness regions embedded in lower surface brightness regions with extension more similar to the hi gas , but below the surface brightness detection limit of our data .",
    "such hi central high surface brightness regions are also seen in local spiral galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the issue of morphology of star - forming galaxies at these redshifts as inferred from wfc3/ir data has been studied intensively by @xcite who find that these systems are not rotationally supported disk galaxies .",
    "rather , they appear to be predominantly unstable , dispersion - dominated , systems fueled by rapid gas accretion which presumably later form extended rotationally supported disks .",
    "they also argue that all these galaxies drive strong outflows with more massive galaxies driving less highly ionized outflows . compared to their sample",
    "the @xmath3 dla galaxy is in the upper third of the mass distribution . for the @xmath3 galaxy the distances and ages",
    "are also consistent with a wind scenario : for an age of 233 myr a mean speed of @xmath29 km s@xmath8 is required to reach 16 kpc .",
    "such winds speeds are well below what is seen in nearby ( more modest ) winds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite argue for a similar system of a galaxy counterpart to a dla at an even larger impact parameter ( dla2243 - 60 in table  [ compare ] ) that the gas causing the dla absorption is in a cold inflow . in their case",
    "the dla metallicity is @xmath30 , which is too high to be pristine gas .",
    "hence , also in this case , an outflow must have been important for determining the properties of the system .",
    "@xcite use statistical arguments to show that most dlas must probe atomic gas with very low star - formation efficiencies .",
    "this would be consistent with a picture where metals in this gas originates from a wind rather than having been formed in situ .",
    "the large impact parameter of the @xmath3 galaxy could also be related to other processes like tidal stripping similar to what is seen in the magellanic stream @xcite .",
    "as dlas are hi cross - section selected such systems will have a higher probability of being selected ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , we note that the correlation between metallicity and impact parameter found by @xcite would not obviously result from such a scenario and we do not see evidence for a nearby galaxy that could have caused tidal stripping .",
    "we note that none of the two galaxies have ly@xmath1 in emission",
    ". this may help explain the many non - detections resulting from searches for dla galaxies in the previous few decades",
    ".    a coherent picture of dlas and their relation to emission selected galaxies could be the following : dlas originate from the outskirts of galaxies with properties ( i.e. , sizes , luminosities , stellar masses , metallicities ) within the range of star - forming lyman - break galaxies at similar redshift , but due to their cross - section selection they are more likely to be drawn from the fainter end of the luminosity function than emission selected galaxies @xcite .",
    "there is evidence that dla galaxies fulfill a metallicity - luminosity relation and therefore high - metallicity dlas are expected to have galaxy counterparts more similar to typical emission - selected galaxies ( i.e. , lyman - break galaxies seen in ground - based surveys ) than dlas in general which probably have extreme galaxy counterparts @xcite .",
    "the galaxy counterparts of the two dlas towards q0918 + 1636 are consistent with this picture .",
    "thanks to new sensitive near - ir spectrographs the study of galaxy counterparts of @xmath31 dlas has now opened @xcite .",
    "the identification of intervening dlas towards transient sources like gamma - ray burst afterglows have also led to the detection of a galaxy counterpart and this approach hence also appears promising for the future . at the moment observations like these are limited to the bright counterparts of the highest metallicity dlas . with the advent of extremely large telescopes equipped with advanced adaptive optics in the next decade ,",
    "however , such studies can be extended to the galaxy counterparts of more typical dlas and hence a more complete unification of absorption and emission studies of high-@xmath16 galaxies is within reach .",
