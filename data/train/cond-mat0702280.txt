    "<S> the amplitude of the signal and idler tones can become larger than the applied signal amplitude , resulting in signal gain , or parametric amplification . </S>",
    "<S> the parametric amplifier is phase sensitive , amplifying one quadrature of the signal , while deamplifying the other quadrature . </S>",

    "<S> both resonators are undercoupled , i.e. , resistive losses in the center strip are larger than radiative losses through the coupling capacitors .    </S>",
    "<S> the chip containing the sample was mounted and wire - bonded to a printed circuit ( pc ) board which was placed in a copper box . </S>",

    "<S> measurements were made sweeping @xmath0 and @xmath1 from low to high frequencies , keeping @xmath9  khz constant , and stepping the pump power with constant signal power 40  dbm . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) shows a lorentzian line shape at low powers , characteristic for a linear oscillator . </S>",
    "<S> the transmission on resonance is 11.4  db . at higher power bending of the resonance peak to lower frequency </S>",
    "<S> is observed as expected for nonlinearity due to current dependent kinetic inductance . </S>",
    "<S> figure  2(b ) shows the signal gain , i.e. , the output power at @xmath1 divided by input power at @xmath1 . like the pump peak at low power </S>",
    "<S> , the signal also shows 11.4  db loss on resonance , and bending to lower frequency with increasing pump power . above a critical pump power , </S>",
    "<S> the resonator develops a region of bi - stability , where all measured properties depend on the direction of sweep ( see appendix ) . at the point where the pump response becomes unstable , the signal output power increases by about + 5  db . </S>",
    "<S> thus parametric amplification is observed , but there is no overall gain due to the low transmission on resonance . in figure  2(c ) we see the idler gain ( output power at divided by input power at @xmath1 ) which reaches about the same level as the signal gain . </S>",
    "<S> figure 2(d ) shows a cut taken along the dotted lines in figs .  </S>",

    "<S> we clearly see how the the signal and idler gains are maximal at the pump power where the resonator abruptly changes from low amplitude to high amplitude oscillations .        </S>",
    "<S> figure  3(a ) shows the signal gain for sample  2 measured with @xmath10  khz and signal power . </S>",
    "<S> the smaller cross - section of this resonator leads to enhanced nonlinear inductance , and consequently the onset of nonlinear behavior was observed at much lower power . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 we show only a zoomed - in region around the onset of the instability , with more dense sampling in power and frequency . as predicted by theory @xcite </S>",
    "<S> the gain is very sharply peaked at the critical pump power . </S>",
    "<S> we observe as high as + 22.4  db referred to the input of the sample box . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3(b ) shows a cut along the dashed line of figure 3(a ) . here </S>",
    "<S> again the idler gain reaches the same level as the signal gain .    </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinear behavior can be modeled by expanding the distributed inductance and resistance of the transmission line to lowest order in the current . </S>",
    "<S> we have numerically solved the nonlinear transmission line equations , including the capacitive termination , using the method of harmonic balance @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> excellent fits of the model to the measured transmission versus drive power were achieved over a wide range of drive power ( see appendix ) . </S>",
    "<S> the current dependent inductance and resistance per unit legnth , and the peak current in the resonator at the onset of bifurcation @xmath11 were found to be : sample 1 , @xmath12 nh / m , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ma ; sample 2 , @xmath15 nh / m , @xmath16 , @xmath17 ma , where @xmath18 .    </S>",
    "<S> we have also measured the phase - dependence of the amplification , verifying that we can indeed observe deamplification . mixing the output of the resonator with the phase - shifted pump signal </S>",
    "<S> , we found a phase shift of @xmath19 between maximum amplification and maximum deamplification @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one problem that we encountered with these parametric amplifiers was heating of the sample due to the high pump power and internal dissipation in the resonator . </S>",
    "<S> we could verify the heating effect because at temperatures below @xmath20 k , all resonators exhibited a small _ increase _ in the resonance frequency with increasing temperature . </S>",
    "<S> from this measured temperature dependence , we can determine the temperature of the resonator when self - heated by the continuous pump , which was about 900  mk for sample 1 and 450  mk for sample 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the lower temperature of operation for sample 2 is a result of lower pump power , due to a stronger nonlinear inductance . with further optimization of the sample design , </S>",
    "<S> we are confident that parametric amplification can be achieved in the interesting regime where @xmath21 .    summarizing our main results : current dependent kinetic inductance of a superconducting cpw resonator </S>",
    "<S> was used to realize strong parametric amplification . </S>",
    "<S> the gain was sharply peaked at the critical pump power . a maximum gain of + 22.4  db was achieved .    </S>",
