    "over the past decade , roughly a dozen nearby galactic planetary nebulae were found to be a source of extended diffuse x - ray emission ( e.g.   ( * ? ? ? * kastner et al .",
    "2008 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kastner 2009 ) ) .",
    "images taken from space by the x - ray observatories _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ reveal that the diffuse x - ray emission is confined to the closed central cavities of round and elliptical pne , indicating the presence of hot gas with temperatures in excess of @xmath0  k ( for recent examples see guerrero et al . ,",
    "this volume ) . basically , these findings confirm theoretical predictions of wind - heated ` hot bubbles ' , even though the observed x - ray temperatures are much lower ( at least a factor of @xmath1 ) than obtained from simple spherical models assuming that the wind kinetic energy is thermalized in an adiabatic shock .",
    "however , more elaborate models taking into account the heat flux due to thermal conduction across the central ` hot bubble ' , show much lower x - ray temperatures , in good agreement with observational evidence ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* steffen et al .  2008 ) , henceforth paper  v ) .",
    "about @xmath2 of the targeted pne show no evidence of diffuse x - rays , among them old , evolved nebulae and objects with open structures .",
    "note that a large fraction of pne also harbor x - ray point sources at the position of their central stars .",
    "this type of x - ray emission , however , is of a different nature than the extended x - ray emission from the shock - heated hot wind bubbles which are the subject of the present study .",
    "the number of pne with detected diffuse x - ray emission is too small to allow the derivation of reliable empirical trends , such as relations between stellar wind parameters and x - ray properties of the nebula .",
    "likewise , it is difficult to make theoretical predictions based on simple back - of - the - envelope calculations . in very general terms",
    ", the x - ray luminosity , @xmath3 , is given by the x - ray emissivity per unit mass and electron density , @xmath4 , integrated over the emitting volume : @xmath5 .",
    "the emissivity depends on the electron temperature , @xmath6 , and the metallicity of the plasma , @xmath7 ; the mean electron density is proportional to the x - ray emitting mass , @xmath8 , divided by the x - ray emitting volume , @xmath9 . if we want to know how the x - ray luminosity of an object changes in the course of its evolution , we have to know how the product @xmath10 changes with time",
    "this depends mainly on the time evolution of the fast wind of the central star : for a constant wind expanding into an environment with a radial density profile @xmath11 , it can be shown that @xmath12 , and @xmath13 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* koo & mckee 1992 ) ) , such that the x - ray luminosity _ decreases _ as @xmath14 . on the other hand , the more realistic assumption that wind power and momentum flux increase with time ,",
    "e.g. @xmath15 , @xmath16 , leads to an _ increasing _ x - ray luminosity , @xmath17 ( ( * ? ? ? * zhekov & perinotto 1996 ) ) .",
    "moreover , properties of the x - ray emission also depend on the thermal structure of the hot plasma , which is ruled by the efficiency of electron heat conduction .",
    "clearly , detailed numerical models are necessary to make reliable theoretical predictions .",
    "using the potsdam nebel code , we model the combined evolution of central star ( cs ) and circumstellar envelope by radiation hydrodynamical simulation in 1d spherical geometry , accounting for non - equilibrium ionization of the nine most important chemical elements .",
    "a typical model has a radial extent from @xmath18 to @xmath19  cm ( @xmath20 to @xmath21  pc ) . treated in a physically consistent way , it contains the freely expanding cs wind , the inner reverse shock , the ` hot bubble ' consisting of the shocked stellar wind , and the ( double - shell ) pn proper , separated from the ` hot bubble ' by the contact discontinuity and from the surrounding agb halo by the outer shock .",
    "temporally , the simulations start at the tip of the agb and are advanced well into the white dwarf regime , thus covering the formation and complete evolution of the pn .    given the radial temperature and density structure of the hydrodynamical model , we apply the _ chianti _ code ( v6.0.1 , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* dere et al .",
    "1997 , 2009 ) ) to compute , for selected instants along the evolutionary sequence , the emergent x - ray spectrum , the x - ray luminosity , @xmath3 , the characteristic x - ray temperature , @xmath22 , and the surface brightness distribution of the x - ray emitting hot central cavity . for details about the model calculations",
    "see paper  v and references therein .",
    "the work by @xcite was restricted to models with standard galactic - disk elemental abundances , as given in their table1 .",
    "the present parameter study considers the influence of the adopted chemical composition on the resulting x - ray properties .",
    "_ models with scaled metallicities .",
    "_ we have obtained model sequences of different metallicity , @xmath7 , by globally scaling the number densities ( relative to h ) of the metals c , n , o , ne , s , cl , and ar by a common factor @xmath23 with respect to the standard galactic - disk abundance mix , @xmath24 .",
    "as explained in detail in @xcite , changes of the metal content affect both the cooling properties of the nebular matter ( higher @xmath25 more efficient line cooling ) , and the wind of the central star ( higher @xmath26 higher wind power ) .",
    "specifically , we assume here @xmath27 and @xmath28 , so that @xmath29 . at the same time , we assume that the evolution of the central star , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , is unaffected by changes of @xmath7 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* schnberner at al .",
    "2010 ) ) .",
    "our previous studies at standard galactic - disk composition , based on models including heat conduction , had shown that the x - ray luminosity increases steadily with time ( @xmath32 ) until the turnaround point ( maximum @xmath32 ) is reached , after which @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath3 drop rapidly . essentially , the time evolution of @xmath3 reflects the evolution of @xmath34 .",
    "the so far unexplored _ metallicity dependence _ of @xmath3 and @xmath22 is shown in fig.[fig1 ] for a central star with @xmath35  m@xmath36 . for given @xmath32",
    ", @xmath3 increases systematically with metallicity ( left panel ) .",
    "naively , one might have expected that roughly @xmath37 , since both @xmath34 and the number of metal ions scale with @xmath7 .",
    "the numerical results , however , show a weaker @xmath7 sensitivity , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 depends on @xmath32 .",
    "the x - ray temperature increases only slightly with metallicity ( right panel ) , in quantitative agreement with the scaling suggested by eq.(14 ) in paper  v , noting that @xmath40 . in the absence of heat conduction , @xmath22 is significantly higher ( fig.[fig1 ] , right panel ) and  except for the earliest stages of evolution ",
    "@xmath3 is reduced by roughly 2 orders of magnitude ( not shown ) .",
    "we have also investigated sequences of different metallicity for @xmath41  m@xmath36 and @xmath42  m@xmath36 .",
    "qualitatively , the @xmath7 dependence of the x - ray properties is very similar to the case @xmath35  m@xmath36 . summarizing the combined @xmath7 ,",
    "@xmath43 , @xmath44 dependence , the models predict the highest @xmath3 for metal - rich nebulae with evolved ( hot ) massive central stars .",
    "_ models with wolf - rayet - type central stars .",
    "_ wolf - rayet ( wr ) type central stars are characterized by a hydrogen - deficient chemical composition of their atmospheres and winds , and by mass loss rates that exceed those of normal central stars by factors @xmath1 to @xmath45 . in a first attempt to model the x - ray emission of pne with wr - type central stars ,",
    "we have modified our standard simulation ( @xmath43=@xmath46  m@xmath36 ) in two respects .",
    "first , we changed the chemical composition of the cs wind from standard ( h - rich ) to wr - type ( 2% h , 42% he , 49% c , 5% o by mass ) at the tip of the agb ( @xmath44=@xmath47 ) .",
    "this implies that the ` hot bubble ' forms out of h - deficient matter , while the surrounding nebula remains h - rich . for consistency",
    ", we have updated the nebel code with a generalized description of electron heat conduction that is valid for arbitrary chemical composition ( sandin et al .",
    ", this volume ) .",
    "the impact of changing the chemistry of the cs wind is shown by the difference between the two lower curves in fig.[fig2 ] ( left panel ) .",
    "the h - deficient ` hot bubble ' forms at @xmath44@xmath48@xmath49y , @xmath32=@xmath50kk , @xmath51=@xmath52km / s , slightly later than the h - rich bubble ( @xmath53y , @xmath54kk , @xmath55km / s ) , but reaches much higher x - ray luminosities ( up to a factor @xmath45 ) during the early evolution ( low @xmath32 ) .",
    "obviously , the x - ray emissivity ( per unit mass ) is much higher for wr - type matter .",
    "later , the difference in @xmath3 tends to vanish , since the bulk of the hot gas is increasingly made up of evaporated h - rich matter ( see below ) . as a second step ,",
    "we have increased the cs mass loss rate globally by a factor @xmath45 .",
    "this delays the formation of the ` hot bubble ' both for normal ( @xmath56y , @xmath57kk , @xmath58km / s ) , and wr - composition cs winds ( @xmath59y , @xmath60kk , @xmath61km / s ) . as seen in fig.[fig2 ] ( left , upper two curves ) , such models easily exceed the x - ray luminosity measured for bd@xmath62 , a well studied pn with a [ wc]-type central star .",
    "again , corresponding models calculated without heat conduction typically have lower @xmath3 by roughly a factor @xmath45 , except at the very early stages where heat conduction is negligible .",
    "finally , fig.[fig2 ] ( right ) shows the x - ray surface brightness distribution of the test model with wr - type wind composition and scaled - up mass loss rate at a late stage of evolution ( @xmath63  k ) .",
    "the ` hot bubble ' is divided into two chemically distinct parts : the inner region ( @xmath64  cm ) consists of h - deficient matter , the outer shell consists of h - rich matter that evaporated due to heat conduction . in x - rays ,",
    "the h - deficient core of the central cavity shines much brighter than the surrounding h - rich layer ( cf .",
    "jacob et al . , this volume ) .",
    "the observed x - ray luminosities of pne with normal h - rich composition can be explained by hydrodynamical models with heat conduction , either assuming a standard galactic - disk metallicity , @xmath65 , and a range of central star masses between @xmath66 and @xmath67  m@xmath36 , or by a fixed @xmath41  m@xmath36 and a range of metallicity scaling factors between @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the highest x - ray fluxes are expected to originate from pne with wr - type central stars , due to their powerful and h - deficient winds .",
    "models with suppressed thermal conduction ( magnetic fields ) may explain x - ray non - detections ."
