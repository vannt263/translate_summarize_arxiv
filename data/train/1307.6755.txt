    "we here deal with the more general case of a network with given frequency distribution and architecture , and we show that a weighting procedure on the existing links , that combines information on the frequency mismatch of the two end oscillators of a link with that of the link betweenness , has the effect of inducing or enhancing es phenomena for both homogeneous and heterogeneous graph topologies , as well as any symmetric or asymmetric frequency distribution .",

    "the relative independence on @xmath8 can be explained considering that an important condition for es to occur is that each node neighborhood must represent a statistically significant sample of the network frequencies up to give a close enough approximation to the global mean frequency , and therefore the synchronization frequency . to reach this target , the required sampling size @xmath43 for a given population size @xmath8",
    "is usually calculated with the following formula @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 , being @xmath46 the error allowed , @xmath47 the confidence level , and @xmath48 the upper @xmath49 percentage point of the standard normal distribution . aside from the technical details ,",
    "the important feature in the expression is that the sampling size converges to a finite value , even for an infinite population .",
