    "in the central 10 pc of our galaxy , the sgr a region contains several characteristic objects ; a candidate for super - massive black hole ( sgr a * ) of about @xmath7 ( see @xcite and references therein ) , a surrounding cluster of stars ( the central cluster ) , molecular and ionized gas clouds ( the circum - nuclear disk ( cnd ) and sgr a west ) , supernova remnants ( snr g  359.92 - 0.09 and sgr a east ) .",
    "they are surrounded by molecular structures including two giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) m-0.02 - 0.07 and m-0.13 - 0.08 ( also known as the ` @xmath8 cloud ' and the ` @xmath9 cloud ' , respectively ) .",
    "in addition to the two gmcs , recent accurate radio observations have resolved several dense and filamentary molecular features around the sgr a complex ; the ` molecular ridge ' , the ` southern streamer ' , the ` northern ridge ' , and the ` western streamer ' ( see figure  [ 3d_model ] of this paper and figures  3 , 9 , and 10 of @xcite and figure  14 of @xcite ) .",
    "these molecular features are believed to play important roles in feeding the central massive black hole @xcite .",
    "the interaction between these various components is responsible for many of the phenomena occurring in this complicated and unique portion of the galaxy . developing a comprehensive picture of the primary interactions between the components at the galactic center",
    "will also improve our understanding of the nature of galactic nuclei in general .",
    "as the complicated morphology of the central 10 pc is being unveiled thanks to the dramatic progress of radio technology , effort is being made to understand whether these features are really associated with the galactic center or just seen along the line - of - sight in that direction , and to determine the relative positions of them along the line - of - sight , i.e. , the three - dimensional ( 3-d ) spatial structure of the galactic center .",
    "observations of 327  mhz absorption toward sgr a west definitely place sgr a east behind sgr a west ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite observed ring - shaped 1.3  mm dust emission surrounding sgr a east across the @xmath8 cloud and the @xmath9 cloud , and suggested that sgr a east has expanded into these molecular clouds .",
    "based on these observational arguments , @xcite proposed a 3-d structure of the sgr a complex and concluded that the event which created sgr a east and the associated dust shell did not occur deep within the gmcs but close to their surfaces facing the sun .",
    "however , @xcite found co absorption toward a few galactic center infrared ( ir ) sources and suggested that the @xmath9 cloud may be located in front of sgr a west .",
    "they also found some evidence that the @xmath8 cloud lies partly in front of sgr a west .",
    "based on the nh@xmath4 morphology and kinematics observed using the very large array ( vla ) , @xcite located the galactic nucleus ( defined to include sgr a * , sgr a west , and the cnd throughout this paper ) behind the southern streamer ( and the @xmath9 cloud ; see also @xcite ) and the @xmath8 cloud ( or the northern part of the molecular ridge ) slightly behind sgr a east .",
    "they also argued that the distance between sgr a east and the @xmath9 cloud along the line - of - sight should be smaller than 8.4 pc , which is the size of the snr g  359.92 - 0.09 in 20  cm radio continuum images @xcite .",
    "@xcite updated and modified the 3-d model of @xcite based on their additional nh@xmath4 line data and more recently published results ( @xcite and references therein ; @xcite ) , as follows . the nuclear region is placed just inside the leading edge of sgr a east . only some part of the @xmath8 cloud is located in front of the nucleus . the western streamer seen in nh@xmath4 emission is highly inclined to the line - of - sight and is expanding outward with sgr a east .",
    "the northern ridge is placed along the northern edge of sgr a east and is expanding perpendicular to the line - of - sight .",
    "the southern streamer passes over the nucleus in projection but probably does not interact with it .",
    "together , the 3-d models above agree on the following features :    1 .",
    "the galactic nucleus lies in front of sgr a east but behind the southern streamer and part of the @xmath9 cloud along the line - of - sight .",
    "sgr a east is expanding into the @xmath8 cloud , the northern ridge , and the western streamer .",
    "snr g  359.92 - 0.09 is colliding with the southern part of the molecular ridge , the eastern edge of the @xmath9 cloud , and the southern edge of sgr a east .",
    "on the other hand , contradictions among the models raise the following questions .    1 .",
    "is the nucleus in contact with or contained within sgr a east ? 2 .",
    "is the southern streamer falling into the nucleus ?",
    "3 .   has sgr a east expanded into the @xmath8 cloud significantly , or just started to contact it ?",
    "4 .   is sgr a east colliding with the northern part of the molecular ridge ? 5 .",
    "is sgr a east in contact with the @xmath9 cloud ? 6 .   is the @xmath9 cloud located only in front of sgr a east , or also extended further to the backside of it along the line - of - sight ?",
    "it should be noted that the models above are all based on indirect evidence like morphology , kinematics of molecular clouds , or absorption of background radiation by these clouds , rather than on direct , physical interactions between the objects . to answer some of the above questions",
    "directly , we have observed molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath3 ) emission and constructed a 3-d picture of the galactic center .",
    "h@xmath3 emission is an excellent tracer of interactions between dense molecular clouds and other hot and powerful objects , like sgr a east .    in this paper",
    "we report observations of h@xmath3 line emission from regions of interaction between sgr a east and other gaseous components within the central 10 pc .",
    "our observations were almost entirely of the h@xmath3 1 - 0 s(1 ) line . unlike most previous work",
    ", we observed this line at sufficiently high spectral resolution to resolve the velocity profiles and at high enough angular resolution to obtain detailed information on the spatial structure of the emission .",
    "we also obtained measurements of the h@xmath3 2 - 1 s(1 ) line at 2.2477  @xmath10 m at one location in order to investigate the excitation mechanism of the h@xmath3 .",
    "we describe the observations in section  [ observation ] and the reduction of the spectroscopic data in section  [ reduction ] .",
    "based on the directions of the shocks derived from the direct comparison of radial velocities with those from the nh@xmath4(3,3 ) data of @xcite , we construct a 3-d model for the structure of the central 10  pc in section  [ structure ] . in a forthcoming paper",
    "we discuss the properties of the shocks and estimate the explosion energy and age of sgr a east , from which we constrain its origin .",
    "we surveyed four different fields in the @xmath11 line , near the edges of sgr a east where interactions between its hot , expanding gas and molecular clouds in the central 10  pc are expected ( see fig .  [ field_position ] ) .",
    "the northeastern field ( hereafter field ne ) includes part of the @xmath8 gmc and the northern ridge . the eastern field ( field e ) includes the northern portion of the molecular ridge .",
    "the southern field ( field s ) extends along the southern streamer , the northern half of which overlaps sgr a east ; 1720  mhz oh maser emission ( an indicator of shock interactions ) is also found in this field @xcite .",
    "the western field ( field w ) includes portions of the northwestern part of the cnd and the northern part of the western streamer .",
    "the data were obtained at the 3.8  m united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) during 2001 and 2003 using the facility instrument cooled grating spectrometer 4 ( cgs4 ; @xcite ) with its 31  l / mm echelle , 300  mm focal length camera , and a two - pixel - wide slit .",
    "the pixel scale along the slit was 0.90  arcsec with the grating angle of @xmath12 and the slit width on the sky was 0.83  arcsec .",
    "the angular resolution , which was affected by seeing and the optics of the spectrometer , was about 2  arcsec ( @xmath2  pc at the distance to the galactic center ) based on the the measured fwhm of the flux profile of the standard star along the slit .",
    "the instrumental resolution , measured from gaussian fits to telluric oh lines in our raw data , was @xmath13 .",
    "the slit length was @xmath14  90 arcsec , which is longer than the typical size of a molecular clump of @xmath15 or 1.2  pc ( see the nh@xmath4 map in figure  [ field_position ] ) .",
    "cgs4 is a unique instrument in using such a long slit together with an echelle grating .",
    "thus we could employ the observing technique of scanning large fields ( similarly to the low - dispersion observations of @xcite ) with the high spectral resolution .",
    "rectangular fields were observed by stepping the telescope by 3  arcsec perpendicular to the slit axis .",
    "the telescope was nodded between object and blank sky positions every 20 minutes ( one cycle for observing a single slit position consisted of one sky exposure and five object exposures ) , to allow subtraction of the background and telluric oh line emission .",
    "the sky positions were offset by about 25 ( @xmath16 ) from the on - source positions .",
    "we designate each slit position ` slit ' + [ scanning direction ] + [ separation from a ` base position ' in the scanning block it belongs to ; in arcsec ] .",
    "the base position is a starting point of scanning each field block and its coordinates are given in table  [ h2_observations ] .",
    "for example , ` slit nw12 ' in field ne-1 is separated from the base position ( called ` slit 00 ' ) by 12  arcsec toward northwest .",
    "the integration time at each slit position was 1000 seconds .",
    "two stars , hr  6496 ( before 2003 may 28 ) and hr  6310 ( on and after that date ) , were observed for flux - calibration .",
    "the observations are summarized in table  [ h2_observations ] .",
    "the measurements on 2001 august 4 were performed slightly differently from those on other nights . in order to remove bad pixels more efficiently",
    ", the observing positions were jittered along the slit during the 5 exposures taken on each object ( @xmath17p = 0 , + 1 , + 2 , -1 , and -2 pixel in sequence ) .",
    "the data were reduced in three stages . in the first stage , performed at the telescope by the ukirt pipeline reduction software orac - dr , the individual frames were flatfielded and approximately wavelength - calibrated .",
    "the next stage involved the use of standard iraf routines to perform sky subtraction using the sky frames , interpolate over bad pixels , remove s - distortions and wavelength distortion and impose an accurate ( to @xmath18 ) wavelength calibration using oh lines .",
    "we also removed stellar continua and residual skylines , and flux - calibrated using the spectra of hr  6496 and hr  6310 .",
    "we determined the slit losses for these stars by assuming a circularly symmetric point - spread - function ( psf ) based on the flux profile along the slit length , to estimate the missing stellar flux .",
    "the correction factor , which varies with the seeing , ranged from 2.06 to 2.94 @xcite .",
    "the final stage of data reduction involved the use of miriad @xcite , a program package generally used for reduction and image analysis of radio interferometric data .",
    "however , miriad can also be used for a general reduction of continuum and spectral line data .",
    "we employed miriad to stack the 2-d spectral images into a single 3-d data cube for each of the 11 fields ( see table  [ h2_observations ] ) and then combined them into a total data cube that contains coordinate information for every position along every slit for each slit orientation . for more details",
    "see @xcite .    the resulting integrated intensity map for the combined data cube",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ cube_all ] . a smoothed version of the total cube , produced by convolving with a gaussian profile of fwhm = @xmath19 to give a higher signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio , is also presented in fig .  [ cube_all_smooth3 ] .",
    "h@xmath3 is the most abundant molecule in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "we can not , however , observe h@xmath3 directly in cold , dense molecular clouds because the lowest energy levels of h@xmath3 are too high to be excited in these environments ( @xmath20 50  k ) . instead",
    ", h@xmath3 emission is observed in more active regions , for example , in warm regions heated by shocks or in the surfaces of clouds illuminated by far - ultraviolet ( far - uv ) radiation .",
    "h@xmath3 emission has been found associated with star - forming regions , snrs , planetary nebulae , and active galactic nuclei . since the first detection by @xcite ,",
    "a number of groups have observed the galactic center in h@xmath3 line emission . using a fabry - perot ( fp )",
    "etalon @xcite mapped the cnd in the @xmath21 @xmath11 emission with an angular resolution of @xmath22 .",
    "they found that the cnd has a broken , clumpy appearance .",
    "@xcite obtained images in various emission lines ( hei @xmath23 , br@xmath24 @xmath25 , and @xmath11 ) by scanning the telescope perpendicular to the slit , covering spatially an area of @xmath26 and spectrally the entire k window ( 2.02.4  @xmath27 ) with a resolution of @xmath28 .",
    "the near - ir images show a cluster of he emission line stars , the mini - spirals in br@xmath24 , and the cnd in h@xmath3 .",
    "they also observed the h@xmath3 emission peak in the cnd with normal spectroscopic techniques , and suggested collisional fluorescence as the emission mechanism . on larger scales , @xcite surveyed the galactic plane in the @xmath11 emission along a 400-pc strip .",
    "they found that h@xmath3 emission can be seen throughout the surveyed region , peaking toward sgr a. they also mapped the central 50  pc with a beam size of @xmath29 in diameter .",
    "@xcite detected the @xmath11 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 lines at the position ` a ' of the 1720  mhz oh maser detection in figure  [ field_position ] .",
    "but they could not constrain the h@xmath3 excitation mechanisms using line ratios because of large uncertainties in the line fluxes .",
    "@xcite also surveyed h@xmath3 line emission around the regions where the oh masers have been detected , and imaged the cnd and most of the sgr a east region using nicmos on the _ hubble space telescope ( hst)_. their h@xmath3 image has the highest spatial resolution ( @xmath32 ) obtained so far . to study the kinematics of the cnd",
    ", they also observed this field using a fp etalon , with a fwhm spectral resolution of @xmath33 . based on their results , combined with the oh detection",
    ", they suggested that the h@xmath3 gas is shocked and accelerated by the expansion of sgr a east into the @xmath8 cloud and the cnd .    over the past two decades , in spite of dramatic advances in h@xmath3 observations of the central 10  pc , there are still many remaining , unsolved questions .",
    "the h@xmath3 excitation mechanism is still in debate ( uv - heated vs. shock - heated ) , particularly between studies using line ratios @xcite and those based on the relationships with the oh masers @xcite .",
    "the previous observations were concentrated on the cnd , the brightest h@xmath3 feature , rather than the regions where interactions between sgr a east and the surrounding molecular clouds are expected .",
    "also , although the spatial resolution has greatly increased , the spectral resolution has not been high enough to investigate the detailed kinematics ( e.g. , line profiles ) in the interaction regions .",
    "considering that the widths of observed h@xmath3 lines are generally less than @xmath34 , which is the critical velocity for shock dissociation in molecular clouds ( e.g. @xcite ) , the spectral resolutions ( 75130  @xmath35 ) of previous spectroscopic observations with fp etalons @xcite are too low . to study the spatial and dynamical relationships between the various components in the central 10  pc",
    ", it is necessary to observe additional interaction regions other than the cnd , in the h@xmath3 emission at high spatial and spectral resolutions .",
    "the morphology of sgr a east has frequently been determined from the maps of 6  cm synchrotron radiation ( @xcite ; see figure  [ field_position ] ) .",
    "we investigate the morphology of the sgr a east boundary in the h@xmath3 emission , which is imaged for the first time in this study .",
    "figure  [ h2_boundary ] shows our model of the sgr a east boundary in projection based on the h@xmath3 intensity map .",
    "the h@xmath3 emission is significantly stronger than the rms noise of @xmath36 ( the blue color represents roughly a 4-@xmath37 detection ) in most of the fields observed .",
    "the intense h@xmath3 emission arises from the interaction regions related to the @xmath8 cloud and the northern ridge in the northeastern field and from the regions related to the cnd and the western streamer in the western field . in the eastern and southern fields ,",
    "the h@xmath3 emission is weaker .",
    "an elliptical boundary is defined to trace the outer edges of the h@xmath3 emitting regions with the center at @xmath38 ( j2000 ) , which is offset from sgr a * by ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) or @xmath5  pc at the distance of 8.0  kpc to the galactic center @xcite .",
    "the ellipse has a semi - major radius of @xmath41 ( @xmath42  pc ) , a semi - minor radius of @xmath43 ( @xmath44  pc ) , and a position angle of @xmath45 from north to east , which is almost parallel to the galactic plane whose position angle is @xmath46 .",
    "the elliptical boundary is determined qualitatively so that it can include all h@xmath3 emission brighter than 10-@xmath37 and be kept consistent in shape with the morphology in 6-cm continuum @xcite and dust map @xcite .",
    "this model of h@xmath3 boundary might be revised by other studies since the model may depend on geometry or cloud structure as the h@xmath3 emission arises only from local interface regions between sgr a east and the clouds and our h@xmath3 survey does not cover the whole region around sgr a east .",
    "the only conflict with this model is the southern field where the h@xmath3 emission is situated well inside of the synchrotron shell in projection ( compare figure  [ field_position ] and figure  [ h2_boundary ] ) .",
    "we suggest that this southern h@xmath3 emission is not radiated from the southern - most edge of the sgr a east shell but from a position where the tilted surface of the shell contacts a molecular cloud ( i.e. the southern streamer ) in front of or behind it .",
    "alternatively , the h@xmath3 emission may be extended more to the south from the detected position but severely diminished due to a very high extinction toward the southern part of the southern streamer ( see the marginally detected h@xmath3 emission in figure  [ pvd5 ] where all the data in the southern field are summed to increase the s / n ratio ) .",
    "dust emission is strong in this direction ( @xcite ; see figure  9 of @xcite ) and the nh@xmath4 opacity in this region is much higher ( @xmath47 = 25 ) than in the region where h@xmath3 is detected ( @xmath48 ; see figure  2 of @xcite ) .",
    "the 1720  mhz oh maser detected at several positions around this region ( see figure  [ field_position ] ) by @xcite may support this hypothesis .",
    "those authors interpreted the maser detections as indicators of shocks from sgr a east toward its nearby molecular cloud , although @xcite and @xcite argued that they originate from the interaction between sgr a east and the snr g  359.92 - 0.09 .",
    "a similar interpretation is also possible for the @xmath8 cloud . in the northeastern field of our h@xmath3 observation",
    ", the h@xmath3 intensity decreases toward the center of the @xmath8 cloud ( figure  [ h2_boundary ] ) . in this direction",
    "the dust emission is the strongest in the central 10  pc and the nh@xmath4 opacity is as high as in the southern streamer @xcite .",
    "thus it is possible that , even though sgr a east has expanded deeply into this cloud , the shock - excited h@xmath3 emission is highly obscured .",
    "assuming the same center and the same position angle as our h@xmath3 boundary , the projected 6  cm continuum shell can be simplified with an ellipse with @xmath49  pc and @xmath50  pc ( figure  [ other_boundary ] ) .",
    "these dimensions are smaller than those of the h@xmath3 boundary by about 20 per cent .",
    "the boundary of sgr a east defined by h@xmath3 emission is more consistent with the dust ring observed by @xcite than with the outer edge of the 6  cm shell .",
    "the partial ring of 1.3  mm dust emission surrounds the 6  cm synchrotron emission ( see figure  3b of @xcite ) .",
    "this dust ring is well followed by the molecular clouds seen in nh@xmath4 ( see figure  [ other_boundary ] ) . the @xmath8 cloud , the northern ridge , the western streamer , and the southern streamer in nh@xmath4 emission are easily matched with the dust ridges . assuming the same center and the same position angle with our h@xmath3 boundary , the dust ring can be represented with an ellipse with @xmath51  pc and @xmath52  pc , which is nearly identical with the h@xmath3 ellipse although the major axis of the dust ring is slightly ( about 10 per cent ) longer .    in a comparison between their 1.3  mm map and the 6  cm map , @xcite argued that the magnetic field of the synchrotron radiation is created in regions of the shell well down - stream of the shock front .",
    "this argument , together with the fact that the dust ring coincides well with the outer boundary of the h@xmath3 emission , implies that the h@xmath3 boundary defined here actually traces the shock front of sgr a east .",
    "@xcite observed h@xmath3 emission lines from interfaces between sgr a east and each of the @xmath8 cloud ( the gmc m-0.02 - 0.07 ) and the northern ridge .",
    "based on the kinematics , they concluded that the h@xmath3 molecules are excited by shocks from sgr a east although fluorescence works partially as well .    in this paper , large - scale spatial and kinematic structure of sgr",
    "a east and the molecular clouds is investigated by comparing the position - velocity diagrams ( pvds ) of the h@xmath3 and nh@xmath4 emission .",
    "the h@xmath3 emission traces hot ( @xmath53 k ) gas and the nh@xmath4 cool ( @xmath54 k ) gas . in figure  [ pvd_position ] we superimpose the axes of the six pvds shown in figures  [ pvd1][pvd6 ] .",
    "each pv cut is selected to cover bright regions in both h@xmath3 and nh@xmath4 in general .",
    "more specifically , cut c1 is designated to pass through three h@xmath3 emission peaks related to the @xmath8 cloud and a h@xmath3 emission feature around the northern end of the molecular ridge .",
    "cut c2 is approximately along the northern ridge which is curved toward the cnd . to compare the @xmath8 cloud and the northern ridge , cut c3",
    "is laid across the two clouds and their related h@xmath3 emission . cut c4 goes along the whole length of the molecular ridge and the @xmath8 cloud .",
    "the purpose of this cut is to study the relationships between these two clouds and the h@xmath3 emission in this region .",
    "similarly , cut c5 is made to pass through both the cnd and the southern streamer in order to investigate if the streamer is just a foreground feature as suggested by @xcite .",
    "finally , cut c6 goes across both the cnd and the western streamer .",
    "this cut also covers a small patch of h@xmath3 emission in the westernmost part ( find more discussions on this h@xmath3 feature in section  [ shock_directions ] ) .    in figure  [ pvd1 ] ,",
    "most of the nh@xmath4 emission contours trace the @xmath8 cloud and extend to the northern end of the molecular ridge ( at positions @xmath55 ) .",
    "the small patch of emission at positions @xmath56@xmath57 and velocity of about @xmath58 corresponds to the northern end of the northern ridge .",
    "the h@xmath3 emission observed in our northeastern field ( at positions between @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) shows similar velocity peaks as nh@xmath4 .",
    "the velocity extension of h@xmath3 is much broader ; by as much as @xmath61 .",
    "this implies that strong shocks are propagating into the @xmath8 cloud and the h@xmath3 emission arises from turbulent post - shock gas .    in the pvd for cut c4 ( figure  [ pvd4 ] ) which passes through the center of the molecular ridge along its length",
    ", we can see that the h@xmath3 contours are broader in velocity and extend farther to the red side than nh@xmath4 .",
    "thus we are certain that sgr a east is in physical contact with and driving shocks into the molecular ridge too , at least into its northern part .",
    "cut c5 follows the southern streamer ( see figure  [ pvd5 ] ) .",
    "the nh@xmath4 at @xmath62 starts from @xmath63 , continues through the nuclear region ( between @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) , and reaches beyond the northern boundary of the cnd .",
    "the weak nh@xmath4 features at both sides of the southern streamer ( at 10 , 60 , and 80  @xmath35 ) are the satellite hyperfine lines of the strong main line @xcite , so have no additional kinematic meaning .",
    "the nh@xmath4 feature with a very high velocity gradient between @xmath66 and @xmath67 is thought to be associated with the cnd . in figure",
    "[ pvd5 ] , all cuts parallel to c5 in field s are combined to increase the s / n ratio .",
    "the h@xmath3 emission is clearly blue - shifted with respect to nh@xmath4 by at least @xmath9 for both clouds .",
    "thus the sgr a east shock is suspected to be the accelerator of the h@xmath3 molecules also in the southern streamer and the cnd .    in figure  [ pvd6 ] , the northwestern part of the cnd is shown at positions @xmath68 .",
    "the nh@xmath4 emission from this cloud has a very broad velocity distribution ( @xmath69 ) reflecting very complicated and energetic gas motions in the nuclear region .",
    "the related h@xmath3 contours from @xmath70 to @xmath15 are as wide in velocity .",
    "the nh@xmath4 emission contours here peak at @xmath71 and are skewed toward positive velocities while the h@xmath3 emission is peaked at @xmath72 and is also bright toward lower velocities .",
    "this indicates that this part of the cnd is located in front of sgr a east and being pushed toward us by its expansion .",
    "the second molecular feature in figure 12 is the northern half of the western streamer at @xmath73 to @xmath56 .",
    "the h@xmath3 contours from the shocked gas at @xmath74 are as wide as @xmath75 and extended slightly farther ( by @xmath76 ) both to the blue side and the red side than the nh@xmath4 .",
    "thus it is likely that this part of the western streamer actually surrounds the western part of sgr a east and is being swept up by both the front and back of the expanding shell .    in summary , throughout the region",
    ", the h@xmath3 emission lines are significantly broader than the nh@xmath4 emission lines by a factor of 23 .",
    "the h@xmath3 profiles extend either blue - ward or red - ward of the nh@xmath4 which traces the systemic ( rest ) velocity of each molecular cloud more accurately .",
    "this kinematics implies that the h@xmath3 emission around sgr a east clearly originates from shocks propagating into the molecular clouds ( see @xcite for more detailed discussion on the h@xmath3 excitation including partial role of non - thermal excitation ) .",
    "in this section we will discuss the features within the galactic center region .",
    "using our data and past observations ( described below ) , we develop a 3-d view of the region , which we show in figure  [ 3d_model ] .",
    "justification for the placement of the various components is given in the following sub - sections .",
    "sgr a east surrounds the sgr a * complex ( including sgr a west and the cnd ) in projection ( see figure  [ field_position ] ) . along the line of sight , absorption of non - thermal radiation",
    "is obvious evidence that the sgr a * complex lies in front of the sgr a east shell @xcite . a number of arguments , however , suggest that sgr a * is in physical contact with or possibly embedded within the hot cavity of the sgr a east shell ( see @xcite and references therein )",
    ". for example , there exists faint non - thermal emission detected at 90  cm toward the thermally ionized gas although most of the non - thermal emission from sgr a east is absorbed by the ionized gas associated with sgr a west .",
    "this may indicate that sgr a west is embedded in sgr a east and the detected radiation is from the region between sgr a west and the front - most edge of the sgr a east shell toward us @xcite .",
    "there is also observational support for the argument that sgr a east is in physical contact with and driving shocks into the cnd .",
    "@xcite found a linear filament of h@xmath3 emission located at the western edge of the cnd running parallel to the sgr a east shell .",
    "this h@xmath3 feature is thought to occur by shock - heating , as indicated by its morphology , the association with a source of 1720  mhz oh maser , and the lack of evidence for uv heating in the form of thermal radio continuum or br@xmath24 emission .",
    "in addition , a north - south ridge outlining the eastern half of the cnd can be seen in the 20  cm continuum emission @xcite .",
    "this elongated ridge is also detected at 90  cm @xcite , suggesting that it is a non - thermal feature related to sgr a east .",
    "as we will see in section  [ shock_directions ] , sgr a east is driving shocks into the northwestern part of the cnd and accelerating the h@xmath3 gas toward negative velocities .",
    "this interpretation supports the argument of @xcite that the h@xmath3 filament detected along the western edge of the cnd is shock - heated .",
    "absorption features in h@xmath3co , oh , hi , and hco@xmath77 spectra with highly negative radial velocities ( @xmath78 ) have also been observed toward sgr a west @xcite .",
    "the kinematics and spatial distribution of this gas place it at the galactic center and @xcite interpret its highly negative velocity as a result of acceleration by sgr a east .",
    "thus we conclude that sgr a east is situated within the central 10  pc and that it is physically interacting with the sgr a * complex .",
    "sgr a east is also actively interacting with the molecular clouds in the central 10 pc @xcite . in section  [ shock ]",
    "we demonstrate that sgr a east is driving shocks into the surrounding clouds . as a result",
    ", we can determine the relative locations of sgr a east and the clouds in the line of sight , based on the relative radial velocities between the shocked and unshocked gas . hence sgr a east",
    "is used as a key object in understanding the 3-d structure around the nucleus of our galaxy .",
    "in section  [ shock ] , sgr a east is shown to be physically in contact with and driving shocks into all of the surrounding molecular clouds ; the @xmath8 cloud , the northern ridge , the molecular ridge , the southern streamer , the northwestern part of the cnd , and the western streamer . in this section",
    ", we compare the velocity structures of the mutually related h@xmath3 and nh@xmath4 emission using the pvds ( figures  [ pvd1][pvd6 ] ) in order to determine shock directions and positional relationships along the line - of - sight between sgr a east and the molecular clouds .    in figure",
    "[ pvd1 ] , the h@xmath3 emission shows much broader velocity extension than the nh@xmath4 contours of the @xmath8 cloud , both to positive and negative velocities .",
    "this implies that strong shocks are propagating both toward us and in the opposite direction along the line - of - sight , within the @xmath8 cloud",
    ". we can understand this if the western portion of the @xmath8 gmc actually envelops sgr a east , which is expanding into the cloud at both its front and back surfaces .",
    "on the other hand , in figure  [ pvd1 ] , the h@xmath3 emission from the northern end of the molecular ridge has a narrow and very similar velocity distribution to the nh@xmath4 emission .",
    "however , in figure  [ pvd4 ] for cut c4 , which passes through the molecular ridge , the h@xmath3 contours are broader in velocity and extend farther to the red side than nh@xmath4 .",
    "the velocity shift of h@xmath3 here is about @xmath9 which is much smaller than in the @xmath8 cloud . however , considering that the molecular ridge is located at the outermost edge of the sgr a east boundary and that its projected width is only about 1  pc , shocks from sgr a east would propagate into the cloud nearly perpendicular to the line - of - sight and consequently the radial component of velocity shift of the shocked gas must be small .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that the northern end of the molecular ridge is tipped slightly to the backside of sgr a east since the h@xmath3 emission there is red - shifted , i.e. the hot cavity of sgr a east is located in front of the ridge and pushing its material farther away from us .    as for the small emission patch of the northern ridge in figure  [ pvd1 ] , it is difficult to distinguish between the h@xmath3 emission that originated from this cloud and that from the @xmath8 cloud since two molecular clouds overlap along the line - of - sight .",
    "this problem is similar to the other pvds related to the northern ridge ( figures  [ pvd2 ]  &  [ pvd3 ] for cuts c2 and c3 , respectively ) .",
    "however , there is a common aspect in these pvds ; there is no h@xmath3 emission more blue - shifted than the nh@xmath4 .",
    "this implies either that sgr a east is located in front of the northern ridge along the line - of - sight or that the h@xmath3 emission does not originate from shocked gas .",
    "the latter interpretation is not likely as seen in section  [ shock ] ; in figure  [ pvd2 ] , the positions of the bright peaks of broad ( as much as @xmath79 ) h@xmath3 line emission are more closely coincident with two nh@xmath4 peaks of the northern ridge ( at @xmath80 ) than with the single peak of the @xmath8 cloud .",
    "evidence for shocked h@xmath3 emission in the northern ridge can also be found in @xcite .",
    "therefore we conclude that the northern ridge is located to the far - side of sgr a east and is being accelerated away from us .    in figure  [ pvd5 ] for cut c5",
    ", h@xmath3 emission is only seen bright at @xmath81 but at two separate velocities of the southern streamer ( @xmath62 ) and the cnd ( from @xmath82 to @xmath83 ) .",
    "the h@xmath3 emission is clearly blue - shifted with respect to nh@xmath4 by at least @xmath9 for both clouds .",
    "hence we conclude that sgr a east is located behind the southern streamer and the southern part of the cnd , respectively .",
    "figure  [ pvd6 ] includes emission from three different molecular features .",
    "one is the northwestern part of the cnd at positions @xmath84 , where the nh@xmath4 contours peak at @xmath85 .",
    "the related h@xmath3 contours peak at @xmath72 and are broadened toward lower velocities .",
    "this indicates that this part of the cnd is located in front of sgr a east and being pushed toward us by its expansion .",
    "the second feature at @xmath73 to @xmath56 is the northern half of the western streamer .",
    "the related h@xmath3 contours at @xmath74 are extended slightly farther ( by @xmath76 ) both to the blue side and the red side than the nh@xmath4 .",
    "we interpret this as this part of the western streamer partially surrounds the western part of sgr a east and is being swept up by both the front and back of the expanding shell .",
    "the third feature is the h@xmath3 emission at @xmath86 , which must certainly originate in shocked gas considering its wide velocity distribution of @xmath85 .",
    "it is not clear , however , from which molecular cloud it arises . since its position is beyond the boundary of sgr a east ( figures  [ h2_boundary ]  &  [ pvd_position ] ) , we can not determine its line - of - sight position with respect to sgr a east . this h@xmath3 feature beyond sgr a east",
    "may be associated with another phenomenon or accelerating source .",
    "for example , it might be a manifestation of the bipolar streamers or outflows from the galactic nucleus which are suggested by radio and x - ray observations @xcite .",
    "or it might be shocked gas which has leaked out from the bubble ( see the radio continuum feature toward northwest in figure  [ field_position ] ) .",
    "further studies are needed to understand the nature and origin of this h@xmath3 feature .      in the previous sections",
    ", we presented a 3-d model of the inner 10 pc of the galaxy .",
    "our model agrees with the previous studies @xcite on the following points .    1 .",
    "the galactic nucleus lies in front of sgr a east and behind the southern streamer and a part of the @xmath9 cloud along the line - of - sight .",
    "2 .   sgr a east is expanding into the @xmath8 cloud ( m-0.02 - 0.07 ) , the northern ridge , and the western streamer .",
    "in addition to the above , we suggest the following .    1 .",
    "sgr a east is expanding deeply into the western edge of the @xmath8 gmc which envelops it both at the front and rear of the ionized shell .",
    "the molecular ridge is approximately at the same distance as the center of sgr a east , but the northern end of the ridge is tilted slightly to the back of it .",
    "3 .   the northern ridge is in contact with the backside of sgr a east .",
    "4 .   the northern - most end of the southern streamer and the cnd lie in front of sgr a east and are being pushed toward us by it .",
    "the northern part of the western streamer is located at the same distance as the center of sgr a east and barely envelops the western edge of it .",
    "based on the outer boundary of the sgr a east cavity defined by the h@xmath3 line emission and above conclusions , we suggest a revised model for the 3-d structure of the central 10  pc as shown in figure  [ 3d_model ] .",
    "based on the h@xmath3 emission map , we determine the outer boundary of sgr a east where it is driving shocks into the surrounding molecular clouds , to be approximately an ellipse with the center at ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) or @xmath5  pc offset from sgr a * , a major axis of length 10.8  pc , which is nearly parallel to the galactic plane , and a minor axis of length 7.6  pc .",
    "this boundary is significantly larger than the synchrotron emission shell @xcite but is closely consistent with the dust ring suggested by @xcite .",
    "since sgr a east is in physical contact with all of its nearby molecular clouds ( the @xmath8 cloud , the northern ridge , the molecular ridge , the southern streamer , the cnd , and the western streamer ) , we are able to determine the positional relationships between sgr a east and the molecular clouds along the line - of - sight using the shock directions as indicators . based on the determined relationships and the strong evidence that sgr a east is in contact with the nucleus , we suggest a revised model for the 3-d spatial structure of the central 10 pc of our galaxy modifying the previous models of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .      1 .   is the nucleus in contact with or contained within sgr a east ? ",
    "the galactic nucleus is in physical contact with sgr a east since the cnd is pushed toward us by the expanding hot cavity of sgr a east .",
    "2 .   is the southern streamer falling into the nucleus ? ",
    "it is highly probable that the southern streamer is falling into the nuclear region and feeding the cnd .",
    "sgr a east is driving shocks into the northern - most part of this cloud where it meets the cnd in projection .",
    "3 .   has sgr a east expanded into the @xmath8 cloud significantly , or just started to contact it ?  in the h@xmath3 data of the northeastern field , we can see that most of this region is filled with shocked gas from the @xmath8 cloud .",
    "the area corresponds to at least one third of that of the entire cloud .",
    "thus sgr a east has significantly penetrated the cloud . if the cloud is wrapping around the sgr a east shell with a casual morphological coincidence , however , the shocked layer might still be thin and on the surface .",
    "4 .   is sgr a east colliding with the northern part of the molecular ridge ?  yes , we detected shocked h@xmath3 emission from the northern - most part of this cloud .",
    "however , we can not answer the questions related to the @xmath9 cloud .",
    "we know the branches ( the southern streamer and the western streamer ) from this gmc are interacting with sgr a east but the main body of this cloud is located far to the south , beyond the scope of our observations . therefore the position and extent along the line - of - sight of this gmc in figure  [ 3d_model ] is uncertain . according to @xcite , snr g  359.92 - 0.09 is expanding into the molecular ridge , the @xmath9 cloud , and sgr a east .",
    "thus , if we observe the h@xmath3 emission around snr g  359.92 - 0.09 in a similar way to the 3-d observations for sgr a east , the questions about the @xmath9 cloud could also be answered .",
    "we thank the staff at ukirt for their excellent support during our successful observations .",
