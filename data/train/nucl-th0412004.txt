    "the renormalization is found to depend upon the range of the operator , weak for the @xmath3 operator , and strong for the relative kinetic energy . because the two - body cluster approximation used in this work integrates out mainly the short - range part of the interaction , short - range operators , such as the relative kinetic energy , are strongly renormalized , while long - range operators , e.g. , quadrupole , are weakly renormalized . by using a gaussian two - body operator of variable range ,",

    "we start with a system of @xmath4 particles , interacting through the intrinsic hamiltonian @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the nucleon mass , and @xmath7 the bare nn interaction , such as the argonne potentials in coordinate space @xcite or the non - local cd - bonn @xcite .",

    "this procedure introduces a pseudo - dependence upon the ho frequency @xmath9 , and the two - body cluster approximation described below will sense this dependence . in the largest model spaces , however , important observables manifest a considerable independence of the frequency @xmath9 and the model space limit .",
    "a transformation , which accommodates the short range correlations by means of an antihermitian operator @xcite , produces an effective hamiltonian @xmath10 given by @xmath11 note that even if the original hamiltonian contained just one- and two - body terms , the operator @xmath12 and the transformed hamiltonian @xmath10 contain up to @xmath4-body terms .",

    "we will discuss below , in some detail , approximations which allow us to solve the @xmath4-body system ; for now , the derivation is exact .",
    "the purpose of transformation ( [ transfham ] ) is to preserve the solutions of the original hamiltonian when one reduces the infinite dimension of the hilbert space to a finite value which is numerically tractable .",
    "we achieve this by splitting the full space associated with the @xmath4-body system into @xmath13 , or model space , and @xmath14 , the excluded space ; the decoupling condition @xmath15 in addition to the requirements @xmath16 @xcite , ensure that correlations left out by restriction to the model space @xmath13 are properly taken into account for a subset of the exact eigenstates .",

    "this procedure was successfully tested for the deuteron in a restricted space , where we have shown that , for general tensor operators , the matrix elements obtained with effective operators approach the values obtained with bare operators in the full space @xcite .    in order to test the convergence procedure in a realistic model space , one could consider two - body operators which depend only upon the relative coordinates , which can be renormalized similarly to the hamiltonian .",

    "for other @xmath74 transitions , however , we observe , in general , the same minimal effect as for quadrupole transitions .",
    "such a small correction can be more easily understood , as @xmath74 does not connect the model space with the complementary one ; increasing the model space introduces enough correlations in the wave function so that using the bare operator gives @xmath80 values close to experiment .",

    "note , however , the large difference between the strengths obtained with bare operators in @xmath69 and @xmath85 . because of the convergence properties discussed for the effective interaction in the previous section , which can be extended to other operators , one expects that the bare value in the larger model space would be closer to the exact theoretical value than the one in the smaller space .",
    "therefore , one may conclude that at least the value in the @xmath69 space is far from the correct value , and that the effective operator should have a significant impact in this model space .",
    "table [ be2li6 ] shows the opposite result , _",
    "i.e. _ , very little difference between the transition strengths obtained with bare and effective operators .",

    "overall , the difference between the bare operator results in the @xmath69 and @xmath85 model spaces , coupled with the small renormalization at the two - body cluster level , indicate there are sizable effective multi - body interaction effects needed to correct the @xmath69 @xmath79 value .",

    "but in the absence of an exact full space expectation value of this operator one can not tell whether or not the absence of renormalization for long range operators is a consequence of the fact that the bare operator is already close to the exact result . however , in fig .",

    "such small model spaces offer an excellent testing ground for effective operators , for one expects that the smaller the model space , the more significant the renormalization .",
    "for general operators one can not apply the same calculational procedure as for the hamiltonian ; for these we have developed a convergence procedure in which we add correlations from the excluded space a few shells at a time .",

    "we have tested this procedure in the case of the relative kinetic energy , where we obtained slow convergence as the number of @xmath14-states included in the renormalization is increased .",

    "<S> we implement an effective operator formalism for general one- and two - body operators , obtaining results consistent with the no - core shell model ( ncsm ) wave functions . the argonne v8 nucleon - nucleon potential was used in order to obtain realistic wave functions for @xmath0he , @xmath1li and @xmath2c . in the ncsm formalism , we compute electromagnetic properties using the two - body cluster approximation for the effective operators and obtain results which are sensitive to the range of the bare operator . to illuminate the dependence on the range </S>",
    "<S> , we employ a gaussian two - body operator of variable range , finding weak renormalization of long range operators ( e.g. , quadrupole ) in a fixed model space . </S>",
    "<S> this is understood in terms of the two - body cluster approximation which accounts mainly for short - range correlations . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , short range operators , such as the relative kinetic energy , will be well renormalized in the two - body cluster approximation . </S>"
