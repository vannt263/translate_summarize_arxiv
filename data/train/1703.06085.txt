    "though the canonical standard model ( sm ) has been completed by the discovery of the higgs boson and may be a valid effective quantum field theory all the way up to the planck scale ( for recent discussions see @xcite ) it is inconsistent with a number of observations .",
    "they include the non - zero neutrino masses , the presence of dark matter ( dm ) in the universe , and its baryon asymmetry ( bau ) . perhaps , the most minimal way to address all these problems on the same footing is to extend the sm by three right - handed neutrinos with masses below the fermi scale @xcite .",
    "these new fermions @xmath0 , i=1,2,3 ( following the particle data group @xcite we will call them heavy neutral leptons or hnls for short ) are singlets with respect to the sm gauge group and thus are allowed to have majorana neutrino masses .",
    "the lightest of these particles , @xmath1 , may play a role of dark matter @xcite .",
    "two others ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) , if ( almost ) degenerate , can produce the baryon asymmetry of the universe @xcite , @xcite and explain non - zero neutrino masses and mixings at the same time .",
    "this model was dubbed the @xmath4msm for `` neutrino minimal standard model '' @xcite . for a number of computations of baryon asymmetry in this model see @xcite .",
    "the most conservative scenario of the universe evolution , which does not require any new physics beyond the @xmath4msm , proceeds as follows .",
    "first , the universe is inflated by the sm higgs field @xcite and heated up due to higgs field oscillations to temperatures @xmath5 gev @xcite .",
    "the higgs inflation prepares the initial conditions for the hot big bang @xcite at @xmath5 gev : baryon and lepton numbers of the universe are equal to zero , and the number densities of hnls at this time are zero as well .",
    "the particles @xmath2 and @xmath3 enter into thermal equilibrium below the sphaleron freeze - out temperature @xmath6 gev and produce baryon asymmetry of the universe in a set of processes which include their coherent oscillations , transfer of lepton number from hnls to active leptons and back @xcite , @xcite , and rapid anomalous sphaleron transitions @xcite .",
    "the lighter hnl  @xmath1  dm sterile neutrino never equilibrates and is mainly produced at temperatures @xmath7 mev by transitions from the ordinary neutrinos to @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the combination of x - ray and lyman-@xmath8 bounds on the dm sterile neutrino excludes the `` non - resonant '' dodelson - widrow mechanism @xcite for their production , which operates in the cosmic plasma with small lepton asymmetries . in other words , to get enough dm particles @xmath1 , the processes involving @xmath9 should produce @xcite sufficiently large lepton asymmetry @xmath10 which must be present at temperatures @xmath11 .",
    "this is needed to boost the production of @xmath1 due to the resonant mechanism proposed by shi and fuller in @xcite and developed in a rigorous way in @xcite .",
    "the production of this large lepton asymmetry must take place below the sphaleron temperature @xmath12 , otherwise the baryon asymmetry will be too large @xcite .",
    "the estimates of the equilibration rates of @xmath9 in @xcite and in more recent works @xcite based on careful thermal field theory computations showed that for all parameter choices consistent with observed pattern of neutrino masses and oscillations the hnls @xmath9 enter in thermal equilibrium at some temperature @xmath13 exceeding tens of gev and go out of thermal equilibrium at temperatures @xmath14 which can be as small as @xmath15 gev .",
    "this has led to the conclusion that the equilibrium period between @xmath13 and @xmath16 erases all the lepton asymmetry which could have been generated at freeze - in temperature @xmath13 , requiring that the large lepton asymmetry needed for effective dark matter production must be created at @xmath17 .",
    "the analysis made in @xcite demonstrated that a large lepton asymmetry can indeed be generated in the scattering processes involving @xmath9 at the freeze - out temperature @xmath16 and below it in out - of - equilibrium decays of @xmath9 .",
    "this asymmetry does not exceed @xmath18 , leading to the conclusion that the mass of the dm sterile neutrino must lie in the interval from @xmath15 to @xmath19 kev , to be consistent with the lyman-@xmath8 and phase density constraints coming from observations of dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "as for @xmath9 , their _ physical masses _ should be between @xmath20 gev and @xmath21 gev ( the @xmath22-boson mass ) and be extremely degenerate , @xmath23 @xcitemsm lagrangian @xcite . ] .",
    "the latter condition comes from the requirement that the period of @xmath24 oscillations should be comparable with the age of the universe at the time of lepton asymmetry production , to insure the resonance @xcite .",
    "the minimal scenario that has been proven to work , albeit under the requirement of a _ strong fine - tuning _ ( of the order of @xmath25 @xcite ) between two different contributions to the physical mass difference : one coming from the yukawa couplings and the higgs condensate , and another from majorana masses of @xmath9 .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to show that the part of the lepton asymmetry generated at @xmath13 _ can in fact survive until the temperatures of sterile neutrino dm production _",
    "@xmath26 mev , in - spite of the fact that hnls are well in thermal equilibrium between @xmath13 and @xmath16 .",
    "qualitatively , this comes about because of the following reasons . in the symmetric phase of the electroweak theory the transfer of asymmetry from active to sterile sector and back occurs mainly via the processes with fermion number conservation ( we attribute positive fermion number to left - handed neutrinos and to right - handed hnls ) with the rate @xmath27 .",
    "the rate of fermion number non - conserving processes @xmath28 is suppressed by a kinematic factor @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the hnl mass , and @xmath31 is the typical momentum of fermions in the plasma .    on the contrary , in the higgs phase , at temperatures of the order of tens gev , the dominant reaction is induced by the mixing term between @xmath4 s and @xmath32 s and has a rate @xmath28 exceeding that of the universe expansion at @xmath33 .",
    "it proceeds with fermion number non - conservation : left handed neutrinos go into left - handed anti - hnls and vice - versa .    in a large portion of the @xmath4msm parameters the reactions with fermion number conservations are faster and",
    "give the main contribution to baryogenesis at the sphaleron freeze - out temperature @xmath34 gev .",
    "however , in a specific domain of the nhl masses and couplings , the rate of these processes never exceeds the hubble rate .",
    "thus , the asymmetry in this almost conserved number is _ protected from dilution _ , in - spite of the fact that hnls are equilibrated due to the processes with fermion number violation . moreover , at @xmath35 the rate @xmath27 can be close to the hubble rate , meaning that large asymmetry in this number _ can be generated_. to understand whether it is indeed produced would require numerical solution of our integro - differential kinetic equations for many parameters of the @xmath4msm , which is not attempted here .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section [ kin ]",
    "we will derive kinetic equations accounting for helicity structure of hnl interactions . in section [ rates ]",
    "we analyse the different rates and identify the range of @xmath4msm parameters which may potentially lead to large lepton asymmetries surviving until small temperatures where the production of dm sterile neutrino takes place . in section [ concl ]",
    "we summarise our results .",
    "in this section we derive the kinetic equations describing the evolution of hnls density matrix and lepton densities . to elucidate their structure , we will consider first the temperatures well below the electroweak scale , deeply in the higgs phase .",
    "we also neglect for the time being the subtleties related to electric neutrality of the plasma @xcite and consider the system with hnls and active neutrinos only , this will be corrected towards the end of this section .",
    "we take a pair of almost degenerate hnls @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the generalisation to the case of arbitrary number of @xmath32 is straightforward .",
    "it is convenient to unify @xmath2 and @xmath3 in one dirac spinor , as has been done in @xcite , and consider the @xmath4msm lagrangian @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the sm part , @xmath38 is the hnl field in the pseudo - dirac basis , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the common mass and majorana mass difference of hnls , respectively , @xmath41 is a matrix of yukawa coupling constants and @xmath42 is the temperature dependent higgs vacuum expectation value , which is @xmath43  gev at zero temperature",
    ".    we will consider @xmath44 as a perturbation and work in the second order in yukawa couplings and first order in @xmath45 assuming for power counting that @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is a typical value of the yukawa couplings .",
    "the quadratic mixing term @xmath44 leads to communication between sterile sector of hnls and the rest of the sm , ensuring creation and destruction of hnls , their coherent oscillations , lepton number non - conservation , and transfer of asymmetries from active flavours to sterile and back .    to construct kinetic equations , we work in the heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics and use the ideas of @xcite in what follows , etc , playing a crucial role for description of the processes with fermion number conservation . ] .",
    "to describe hnls , we need four creation operators @xmath48 , where @xmath49 describes the hnl helicity , and two ( for each generation @xmath8 ) neutrino and antineutrino operators , @xmath50",
    ".    let @xmath51 be a ( time - independent ) density matrix of the complete system .",
    "the hnl abundances , including coherent quantum - mechanical correlations between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , are given by the averages @xmath52 $ ] , @xmath53 $ ] , @xmath54 $ ] , and @xmath55 $ ] .",
    "the neutrino number densities are @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "symbolically , all these number - density operators will be denoted by @xmath58 . with the use of our generic notation @xmath58 ,",

    "the time derivative of @xmath60 is readily found : @xmath61\\rho\\right)~ ,   \\label{eq : fp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is the total hamiltonian of the system under consideration .",
    "since we neglected the existence of charged leptons for the moment , the commutator of @xmath58 with the sm hamiltonian is zero , the only non - trivial contribution comes from the interaction hamiltonian @xmath63 , associated with @xmath44 defined in ( [ eq : l ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see that the commutators @xmath64 $ ] are the quadratic polynomials with respect to creation and annihilation operators , containing all possible terms , to list just a few : @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "these operators are multiplied by the first power of yukawa couplings or by @xmath45 .",
    "denote by @xmath68 these binomials , and by @xmath69 $ ] .",
    "now we continue the chain , and write an equation for every @xmath70 which appeared at the first step : @xmath71\\rho\\right)~ ,   \\label{eq : fp1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and then repeat the procedure again and again . in this way we get an infinite chain of kinetic equations , which includes the averages of higher and higher polynomials in creation and annihilation operators .    to truncate the system , we proceed as follows .",
    "the total hamiltonian of the system can be written as @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the quadratic part including hnls and active neutrinos , and @xmath74 describes the sm interactions .",
    "as an example , let us take an operator @xmath75 .",
    "its commutator with the total hamiltonian contains 3 terms .",
    "the first one is @xmath76= - ( e_n(k ) - \\epsilon_{\\nu_{\\beta } } ( k ) ) q_1 ^ 1 ,    \\label{eq : h0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the energies of hnl and active neutrino respectively ( the small neutrino mass can be safely neglected here ) .",
    "the second is @xmath79= \\sigma_i c_i q^0_i$ ] where @xmath80 are the coefficients containing yukawa couplings and @xmath45 .",
    "the third one is @xmath81 $ ] and is of the order of fermi constant @xmath82 and of 4th order in creation and annihilation operators .",
    "it accounts for neutrino interaction in the medium .",
    "the first two terms contain the operators that have already showed up in the first kinetic equation ( [ eq : fp ] ) , while the third one contains new operators . to find",
    "their time evolution would require next steps in the iterative procedure .    to deal with the third term",
    ", we note that the neutrino interactions in the plasma can be accounted for by modification of neutrino energy @xmath83 , replacing it with the temperature dependent dispersion relation @xmath84 ( related to the real part of neutrino propagator @xmath85 ) and by attributing to it an imaginary part @xmath86 ( associated with absorptive part of @xmath85 ) .",
    "these considerations suggest the following modification of the commutation relations : @xmath87 \\to ( e_\\nu(k)+i\\gamma_\\nu ( k)/2 ) a_{\\nu_\\alpha}(k ) , \\\\ [ a^\\dagger_{\\nu_\\alpha}(k),h_2 ] \\to -(e_\\nu(k)-i\\gamma_\\nu ( k)/2 ) a^\\dagger_{\\nu_\\alpha}(k ) , \\label{eq : hnew}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the signs in front of @xmath88 are chosen in such a way that they correspond to damping rather than an instability .",
    "the similar rules apply to antineutrinos .",
    "these substitutions effectively account for the third term which can now be removed .",
    "the system of kinetic equations for @xmath60 and @xmath70 is now complete .",
    "it can be simplified even further as the active neutrinos are well in thermal equilibrium at all temperatures we are interested it , @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the hubble rate .",
    "again , we take @xmath91 as an example .",
    "the equation for it now reads @xmath92 and has an approximate slow varying solution @xmath93 all @xmath70 can be found in this way and inserted into equation ( [ eq : fp ] ) for @xmath60 . as a result",
    ", we get the kinetic description in terms of @xmath60 only .",

    "in this paper we have derived kinetic equations for low scale leptogenesis , accounting for helicity effects in hnl interactions with active flavours . they are valid both for high temperatures around the sphaleron freeze - out ( to describe the baryogenesis ) , and for smaller temperatures to account for lepton number generation .",
    "we showed that the total lepton number can be considered as approximately conserved in the certain domain of @xmath4msm parameters , and thus can potentially be generated at @xmath35 and survive until small temperatures making the resonant production of dm possible .",
    "it is still remains to be seen whether sufficiently large lepton asymmetry is indeed generated , as these depends on cp - violating effects .",
    "the work in this direction is in progress .",
    "quite remarkably , the requirement of existence of approximately conserved leptonic number makes the region of small hnl masses preferable , allowing to search for hnls at ship or ship  like experiments . at the same time",
    ", it lies close to the lower bound coming from the requirement to explain neutrino masses via see - saw , urging to design the experiment in this mass region with highest possible sensitivity .",
