    "preliminary nfi data analysis by nicastro et al .",
    "( 2001 ) showed the presence of two sources , one in the lecs between 0.1 and 4 kev , and the other in the mecs between 1.6 and 4 kev .",
    "it is still not clear whether the mecs and the lecs sources are really distinct and which ( if any ) is related to grb000615 .",
    "optical , ir and radio follow - up observations did not detect any transient in the wfc error box ( stanek et al .",

    "we present a refined analysis of the high energy _ _ beppo__sax data along with that of optical data of the wfc error box .",
    "figure 1 , left panel , shows the wfc ( 210 kev and 1028 kev ) and grbm ( 40700 kev ) light curves of grb000615 .",
    "the @xmath1ray emission lasted about 13 s , while the x  ray emission was detected over a substantially longer interval of 120 s. moreover , the bulk of the x  ray emission started @xmath8 40 s after the @xmath1ray peak . in order to perform time - resolved spectral analysis of the grb emission in the 2700 kev range , we divided the light curves into three time intervals ( a , b and c",
    "; see fig . 1 , left panel ) of duration 30 s , 30 s and 60 s , respectively .",
    "the spectra integrated over these time bins were analysed separately . in our fits the @xmath0 was fixed at the galactic value ( 2.7@xmath910@xmath10 @xmath11 ) unless otherwise stated .",
    "the best - fit parameters for the three spectra are reported in table  1 .    in the first 30 s ( slice a )",
    "the spectrum was first fitted with a single power - law ( pl ) with photon index 1.5 @xmath2 0.2 . however , a 90% probability improvement was obtained using a single pl with free @xmath12 . in this case",
    ", we had a weak suggestion for a large @xmath0 value ( @xmath82@xmath910@xmath13 @xmath11 ) , as shown in table  1 .",
    "we also fitted these data with the band model ( band et al .",
    "1993 ) or with a broken pl , but the spectral parameters were largely unconstrained .    the wfc data of the second temporal slice ( b ) were well fitted with a single pl with index 1.9 @xmath2 0.3 ; however , this model were inconsistent with the grbm upper limits .",
    "when these were accounted for the fit , the pl index was steeper than 2.12 , which was still within 1@xmath14 from the wfc data best - fit .",
    "the spectrum of slice c was best fitted with a pl of index 2.2 @xmath2 0.3 . however , an excess around 8 kev appeared in the residuals .",
    "when we added a narrow gaussian line to the model , the fit improved at the 98% confidence level , but using instead a recombination edge model , the parameters were poorly constrained . nevertheless , assuming that this excess was due to the fe recombination edge at 9.27 kev , a redshift @xmath15 0.13 was derived .",
    "the 210 kev to 40700 kev fluence ratio of this grb is 1.73 @xmath2 0.22 , one of the highest to date found for a _ _ beppo__sax grb ( marginally higher than that of grb990704 , which was 1.52 @xmath2 0.15 ; feroci et al .",
    "confirming the preliminary results of nicastro et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , the analysis of the mecs data revealed the presence of an uncatalogued steady x - ray source in the 1.64.5 kev interval .",
    "its position was consistent with the wfc error box of the grb .",
    "the spectrum of this object was fitted with either a pl with index @xmath82.3 or with a blackbody having @xmath16 0.6 kev .",
    "the average flux in this band was ( 8.0 @xmath2 1.6 ) @xmath9 10@xmath17 erg @xmath11 s@xmath18 .    in the lecs image we detected some signal at the center of the wfc error box with a significance of 2.5 @xmath14 between 0.2 and 1.5 kev during the first 60 ks ( corresponding to 15 ks of actual on - source time ) of the observation .",
    "its position was 2@xmath19 away from the center of the mecs source error box , and therefore marginally consistent with it , considering the low s / n .",
    "the non - detection of substantial emission in the lecs at the position of the mecs source suggested that additional absorption ( @xmath20 4@xmath910@xmath21 @xmath11 ) could be present if the pl model was chosen .",
    "no additional @xmath0 was required if , instead , a blackbody model was assumed .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     figure 1 , right panel , shows the 24 kev flux of the grb and of the mecs source .",
    "the plotted line corresponds to a power - law decay with index @xmath22 1.7 which is typical for x  ray afterglows .",
    "the steadiness of the flux from the source detected in the mecs is intriguing and could suggest that this was not the grb afterglow ; nevertheless this unusual behaviour occurred at least in another case , grb970508 ( piro et al .",
    "1998 ) , in which a rebursting laid on a powerlaw decay was observed .",
    "we performed an accurate analysis of @xmath23-band data ( stanek et al .",
    "2000 ) acquired at flwo on june 15 and 16 , 2000 ; the results confirmed that 4 hours after the grb trigger no optical afterglow was present in the wfc error box down to @xmath24 22 , i.e. slightly deeper than the previous limit ( @xmath24 21.5 ) determined from these data .",
    "grb000615 is probably the x  ray richest grb observed by _",
    "bepposax _ , with a fluence ratio @xmath25 .",
    "we found marginal evidence of spectral evolution in the prompt event : during the first 30 s , the spectrum shows very marginal evidence of absorption in addition to the galactic one , which may be due to a high density circumburst medium . between 60 and 120 s after the trigger , an emission feature is present at 98% confidence level , which can be interpreted as a fe recombination edge at @xmath15 0.13 .",
    "an uncatalogued and non - significantly variable source is detected with the mecs in the 1.64.5 kev energy range .",
    "the 24 kev fluxes measured by the wfc during the prompt event and by the mecs during the nfi pointing can be connected assuming a power - law decay of index 1.7 , which is typical for x - ray afterglows . while the steadiness of the mecs source flux is uncommon in afterglows , we note , as remarked before , that this behavior is reminiscent of the short - term variability exhibited by the x  ray afterglow of grb970508 .",
    "a transient 2.5@xmath14 signal is present below 1.5 kev in the lecs image , at a position marginally consistent with the mecs source , but fully consistent with wfc error box .",
    "although this latter circumstance may suggest its association with the grb , the low significance of the detection prevents us to establish its reality and its relationship with the afterglow ."
