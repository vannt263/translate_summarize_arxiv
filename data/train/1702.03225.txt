    "<S> when strained beyond the linear regime , soft colloidal glasses yield to steady - state plastic flow in a way that is similar to the deformation of conventional amorphous solids . due to the much larger size of the colloidal particles with respect to the atoms comprising an amorphous solid , colloidal glasses allow to obtain microscopic insight into the nature of the yielding transition , as we illustrate here combining experiments , atomistic simulations , and mesoscopic modeling . </S>",
    "<S> our results unanimously show growing clusters of non - affine deformation percolating at yielding . in agreement with percolation theory , the spanning cluster is fractal with a fractal dimension @xmath0 , and the correlation length diverges upon approaching the critical yield strain . </S>",
    "<S> these results indicate that percolation of highly non - affine particles is the hallmark of the yielding transition in disordered glassy systems .    </S>",
    "<S> soft materials like colloidal suspensions , foams and concentrated emulsions exhibit linear elastic behavior under applied strain up to a critical strain beyond which the response becomes non - linear , indicating the onset of plastic flow @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the microscopic origin of yielding lies in the irreversible plastic rearrangements that occur at the particle level @xcite . whereas in crystals plastic </S>",
    "<S> deformation occurs via the motion of topological defects  @xcite , in amorphous materials plasticity is associated with irreversible rearrangements of localized and highly strained zones @xcite . although rheological studies of soft glassy materials have allowed for an extensive investigation of yielding and plastic flow at the macro scale @xcite , their microscopic origin is still strongly debated @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> microscopic experiments so far have largely investigated particle dynamics in the steady - state regime @xcite , where plastic events are correlated by long - range quadrupolar strain fields @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such irreversible rearrangements are also observed in quiescent glasses or at small strain in the transient stages of deformation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> what remains unclear is how these rearrangements grow and organize with increasing strain , eventually leading to yielding and plastic flow of glasses @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> experimental insight into this behavior is of fundamental importance both for theory and for applications .    </S>",
    "<S> theoretical models and simulations investigating avalanche dynamics in sheared athermal amorphous solids have focused on power - law scaling and critical behavior close to the yield point  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> how far such a scaling description is valid at finite shear rates and finite temperatures is , however , a topic of active research @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> experimental investigations in this direction are scarce . </S>",
    "<S> recent oscillatory shear measurements of concentrated emulsions and colloidal glasses @xcite have extended the ideas of reversible to irreversible transition ( absorbing phase transition ) to yielding of soft materials . </S>",
    "<S> these microscopic studies , which are mainly quasi two - dimensional , show that in contrast to macroscopic measurements , the microscopic signatures of yielding are indeed sharp .    </S>",
    "<S> in this letter , we complement confocal microscopy experiments on three - dimensional hard - sphere colloidal glasses with atomistic simulations of metallic glasses and mesoscopic modeling , to elucidate the microscopic dynamics in the transient state across yielding . </S>",
    "<S> we find that highly non - affine particles form clusters that grow with strain to eventually , at a critical strain of about 10@xmath1 , percolate across the sample . </S>",
    "<S> these clusters have a fractal dimension close to 2 that remains constant with strain . </S>",
    "<S> their size , as measured by the correlation length of non - affine particles , diverges upon approaching the critical strain , indicating scale - free structures . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the general picture is surprisingly robust across all systems studied , independent of the microscopic detail of the material , indicating that this percolation picture of yielding is much more general and applies to amorphous materials beyond colloidal glasses . </S>",
    "<S> however , we also find that the exponent @xmath2 governing finite - size scaling of the percolation transition is not universal , taking different values for particle - based and mesoscale models .    </S>",
    "<S> we use hard - sphere colloidal suspensions that are good model systems for glasses ; structural relaxations slow down at particle volume fractions larger than @xmath3 , the colloidal glass transition @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our sterically stabilized fluorescent polymethylmethacrylate ( pmma ) particles have a diameter of @xmath4 , with a polydispersity of @xmath5 to prevent crystallization , and are suspended in a density and refractive - index matching mixture of cycloheptyl bromide and cis - decalin . </S>",
    "<S> the particle volume fraction is @xmath6 as estimated from the centrifuged sediment , and we measured a structural relaxation time of @xmath7 sec by microscopy , which is a factor of @xmath8 larger than the browning time @xmath9 . to investigate the transient deformation , we started from an equilibrated state ( rejuvenation and subsequent relaxation for three hours ) and applied uniform , slow shear at constant rate @xmath10 , of the order of the inverse structural relaxation time . </S>",
    "<S> confocal microscopy is used to image @xmath11 particles in a @xmath12 by @xmath12 by @xmath13 volume , and to follow their positions in three dimensions with an accuracy of @xmath14 in the horizontal , and @xmath15 in the vertical direction  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> individual particles are tracked during a @xmath16 time interval from image stacks taken every @xmath17 , hence the experimental time increment @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> + we perform molecular dynamics simulations of the compression of cuzr metallic glass using the embedded atom method ( eam )  @xcite , as described in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> simulations are performed using the lammps simulator package  @xcite , with gpu parallelization @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the sample is prepared starting from a cu fcc single crystal with a lattice constant @xmath19  nm enclosed in a simulation box with periodic boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the alloy is generated by first transforming approximately 40% of cu atoms into zr and then performing a heat treatment @xcite at 2300  k for 20  ps , followed by rapid quench to 10  k in 200  ps , and final relaxation at 10  k for another 20  ps . the relaxed system is compressed along @xmath20 at a constant strain rate @xmath21  @xmath22 , at @xmath23  k. we confirm the results are qualitatively robust upon varying the strain rate . </S>",
    "<S> temperature and pressure are controlled using a standard nos - hoover thermostat and a barostat  @xcite , with a characteristic relaxation time of 1  ps . </S>",
    "<S> the barostat ensures that the @xmath24 and @xmath25 components of the stress tensor are close to zero . </S>",
    "<S> we also simulate a fully tensorial mesoscale elasto - plastic model , similar to other models commonly employed to study yielding in amorphous media @xcite , on a 3d cubic lattice of linear size @xmath26 . </S>",

    "<S> active sites are just the sites where plastic slip takes place .    [ ! ]     reconstructions of the colloidal glass reveal active particles cluster in space , and the clusters grow with applied strain , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a - c ) . with increasing strain these fluid - like clusters expand and grow in size and new clusters appear in the field of view . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig2](a ) shows the evolution of the largest and second largest cluster . </S>",
    "<S> both increase initially with strain , but at some critical strain @xmath42 the largest cluster takes over : the second largest cluster stops growing and shrinks , while the largest cluster continues to grow , until its size eventually saturates . </S>",
    "<S> we use the cross - over strain @xmath43 to define the microscopic yielding transition of the material . </S>",
    "<S> this critical strain is approximately @xmath44 in our colloidal glass , comparing well with the macroscopic yielding transition in rheological studies of hard - sphere glasses  @xcite , where yield strains of around @xmath45 are found for @xmath6 . </S>",

    "<S> the exponent @xmath46 indicates a cluster fractal dimension of 2 . ]    [ cols= \" < , < , </S>",
    "<S> < , < \" , ]     we find that the clusters have fractal shape . to show this we compute the cluster radius of gyration @xmath47 @xcite , as a function of cluster size @xmath48 , which we plot in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the radius of gyration scales with cluster size @xmath41 as @xmath49 with @xmath50 , indicating that the clusters have a fractal dimension @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that this scaling is robust and independent of the applied strain . </S>",
    "<S> this fractal structure is in line with the hierarchical organization of plasticity observed in the steady - state flow after yielding  @xcite , and indicates a near - critical state of the system . </S>",
    "<S> + to investigate the growth of fractal clusters upon approaching @xmath42 , we compute the characteristic length scale of non - affine regions . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the correlation length of clusters of non - affine particles using @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the radius of gyration for cluster size @xmath53 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this correlation length increases with the increasing fraction @xmath40 of active particles and diverges near a critical fraction @xmath54 , at the critical strain @xmath42 , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](a ) . around this strain , </S>",
    "<S> we measure a correlation length of @xmath55 , of the order of the thickness of the sheared colloidal layer of @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> this growth of correlation length is in line with the growing correlation time scale observed in oscillatory yielding experiments  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , by plotting the correlation length as a function of the distance @xmath57 to the critical fraction ( fig .  [ fig4](a ) , inset ) , we find that the correlation length grows with a power law @xmath58 upon approaching the critical fraction @xmath59 . here , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> this exponent appears close to that predicted for percolation in three - dimensional continuum percolation models  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the emerging picture is thus that regions of highly non - affine , fluid - like particles grow and eventually , at the yielding transition , percolate across the sample . to test this idea in more detail </S>",
    "<S> , we apply concepts from percolation theory and follow the size of the largest cluster as a function of the total number of active particles . </S>",
    "<S> we plot the fraction @xmath61 of particles in the largest cluster as a function of the total fraction of active particles in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> this fraction increases sharply at @xmath59 , indicating that the largest cluster abruptly takes over and absorbs all active particles . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario is indeed characteristic for percolation : the fluid - like particles that percolate at yielding produce a fluidized network that sustains the steady - state flow after yielding . </S>",
    "<S> the critical fraction of highly active particles is @xmath62 at @xmath63 , i.e. approximately 16@xmath1 of the total number of particles . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding critical strain is again @xmath64 , in good agreement with reported yield strains of colloidal glasses . </S>",
    "<S> we hence find that the microscopic origin of yielding is the percolation of highly non - affine particle clusters , producing a fluid - like network in a solid matrix .    </S>",
    "<S> our simulations allow us to study the transition at @xmath65 in greater detail , by performing a finite - size scaling collapse of the mean cluster size @xmath41 as a function of active particle fraction , @xmath40 , using the standard percolation rescaling @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig4](c ) shows the results for atomistic simulations , where @xmath67 and exponent @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> this exponent agrees very well with the expected value for percolation in three dimensions of @xmath69 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , our mesoscale simulations also show a percolation - like transition at @xmath70 , but with exponent @xmath71 , as shown by the excellent fits of @xmath72 and the data collapse of @xmath73 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](d ) . </S>",
    "<S> the different scaling exponent appears to be a particular feature of the mesoscopic model that is at odds with atomistic simulations and experiments . </S>",
    "<S> this may suggest that models including only linear elasticity and quenched disorder @xcite , might be too simple to recapitulate the detailed scaling features of the percolation transition associated with amorphous yielding .    to summarize </S>",
    "<S> , we have used experiments on colloidal glasses and atomistic and mesoscale simulations to show that the microscopic yielding of glasses originates from the percolation of non - affine , plastic regions . </S>",
    "<S> non - affine particles form clusters that grow with applied strain and eventually merge . at some critical fraction of non - affine particles , </S>",
    "<S> the largest cluster abruptly takes over and absorbs all other non - affine particles to produce a percolated network . </S>",
    "<S> the non - affine clusters themselves have fractal shape , and upon approaching the yielding transition , their size diverges in a critical fashion . the robust fractal dimension and its identical value in colloidal experiments and simulations points towards a universal critical transition at the yielding of glasses . </S>",
    "<S> the general percolation phenomenology we uncover here is robust and appears regardless of the microscopic detail of the system studied . </S>",
    "<S> we have reported similar results in experiments on colloidal glasses , where particles have a micrometer size , in simulations of metallic glasses where particles are at atoms , and in mesoscale simulations where particles are not even present . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests a common scenario ruled by the interplay between structural disorder and elasticity , which are the two common ingredients of the systems we study . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is less clear that the phenomena are strictly universal in terms of critical exponents and scaling functions . </S>",
    "<S> while in colloidal and metallic glasses , clusters are described by three - dimensional conventional percolation scaling , our mesoscale model yields a different exponent @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this result raises interesting questions on the most appropriate coarse - grained description of the yielding of amorphous solids . </S>"
