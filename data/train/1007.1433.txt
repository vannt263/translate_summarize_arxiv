    "they presented evidence that both lte and non - lte models increasingly over - predict the @xmath4 level for @xmath7    as the @xmath0 value of the star decreases from that of early g stars to that of early k. the investigations to date have been restricted to bright standard stars for which there is very high quality spectroscopic and spectrophotometric data , with the consequence that the quality of the sed fit has not been well sampled in the stellar parameter space @xmath8}$ ] . here , we take the first major step to rectify the situation by comparing a large grid of model seds spanning the cool side of the hr diagram to observed seds taken from the spectrophotometric catalog of @xcite .",

    "we also compare our @xmath0 values inferred from sed fitting to other empirical and theoretical @xmath0 calibrations .",
    "@xcite presented a large catalog ( henceforth b85 ) of observed seds taken with photo - electric instruments on 0.5 m class telescopes at various observatories in the former ussr from the late 1960s to the mid 1980s and uniformly photometrically re - calibrated to the `` chilean system '' ( @xcite contains a more detailed description of the individual data sources included in this compilation ) .",
    "these data sets all generally cover the @xmath12 range 3200 to 8000    with @xmath13  , and have a quoted `` internal photometric accuracy '' of @xmath14 .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    we have harvested from the b85 catalog a sample of stars that meet the following criteria : 1 ) having an entry in the 5@xmath15 revised edition of the bright star catalogue @xcite , ( henceforth bsc5 ) , 2 ) having a spectral class later than g0 and earlier than m0 , 3 ) having a luminosity class in the range from v to iii , 4 ) having an entry in the metallicity catalog of @xcite , 5 ) having no variability , chemical peculiarity , or binarity flags in bsc5 , and 6 ) having an @xmath4 distribution that was not obviously inconsistent based on visual inspection , with those of other stars of the same bsc5 spectral class and within @xmath16 sub - class .",
    "the spectral and luminosity classes were taken from the revised catalog of mk spectra types for the cooler stars @xcite , the paper of @xcite , or the perkins catalog of revised mk types for the cooler stars @xcite , in decreasing order of preference . for nine objects without spectral classes determined by keenan or his collaborators",

    "application of criterion 6 ) necessitated only including stars for which there was more than one object of the same spectral class , to within @xmath17 sub - classes .",
    "we found that application of these six criteria , along with the metallicity criteria described below , limited us to 33 stars of spectral class ranging from g5 to k4 for giants and g0 to g5 for dwarfs .",
    "all spectra were corrected for their heliocentric radial velocity , _ rv _ , using the rv values in bsc5 .",
    "however , we expect the rv correction to have a very minor effect on the quality of spectral fitting at the low spectral resolution of the b85 data .",

    "these two ranges are expected to contain stars of measured [ @xmath10 approximately equal to 0.0 and -0.5 , respectively , on the grounds that the quoted uncertainties , @xmath20 $ ] , of determinations of _ overall _ metallicity typically have quoted uncertainties of the order of @xmath21 . for stars that contained multiple entries in the catalog of @xcite , we based the metallicity selection on either the mean , or the median , value of [ @xmath10 , depending on whether there were obvious outlier values and skew .",

    "we have separately calculated mean and deviation spectra for each sub - sample .",
    "the k0 iii sample , shown in fig . [ fvaryk0iii ] is special in that it contains more spectra than the other sub - classes ( 14 spectra of ten objects ) , and the distribution of spectra has a bifurcation that can be most clearly seen in the @xmath26 region from 3.52 to 3.55 ( 3300 to 3550  ) .",
    "therefore , we have broken up the k0 iii sample into two sub - samples , an @xmath27 sub - sample of four stars ( six spectra ) with `` low '' , and an @xmath28 sub - sample with six stars ( eight spectra ) with `` high '' , uv @xmath4 level , respectively . the stars belonging to the @xmath27 and @xmath28 sub - samples",

    "this bifurcation may be an artifact of our sorting of stars with an effective precision of about one spectral sub - class .",
    "around k0 , stars can be typed to half - sub - class precision ( see , for example , @xcite ) , and differences of @xmath29 spectral sub - classes would presumably have the greatest effect in the blue and near uv spectral bands .",

    "arcturus is flagged in bsc5 as being chemically peculiar , with the spectral class designation being k1.5iiife-0.5 .",
    "[ [ section-3 ] ]    with an apparent @xmath31 band magnitude of -0.04 , the b85 spectrophotometric data for arcturus should be of relatively high quality .",
    "the b85 catalog contains three measured @xmath4 distributions , two of which are consistent with each other on the basis of visual inspection .",
    "the third is higher by about 0.05 dex for @xmath26 less than about 3.55 ( @xmath32  ) .",
    "we have formed a sample at spectral class k1.5 iii for stars of nominal @xmath2 $ ] equal to -0.5 using these three seds .",

    "a @xmath34 interval of 125 k is close to the nominal @xmath0 difference between successive spectral sub - classes among gk stars ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , we interpolate in our synthetic spectrum grid to achieve an effective @xmath34 of 62.5 k , as described below .",
    "[ [ section-4 ] ]    for spherical models , a value of the effective radius , @xmath35 , at @xmath36 is also required as input .",

    "@xcite found that for supergiant models of given @xmath0 and @xmath9 , which are even more spherically extended than our models .",
    "the choice of mass in the range 2.5 to 7.5 @xmath38 lead to only small differences in the _ relative _ sed .",
    "[ [ section-5 ] ]    the observed sed will depend on the value adopted for the micro - turbulent velocity dispersion , @xmath39 , which determines the extent to which spectral lines are blended in crowded spectral regions , such as the blue band , and therefore , affects the @xmath4 level to different extents in different @xmath12 regions .",
    "we adopted values of 1.0 and 2.0 km s@xmath40 for @xmath9 values",
    "greater than and less than 3.5 , respectively .",
    "@xcite found that @xmath41 km s@xmath40 provided a good fit to the solar sed from the near uv to the red . from analysis of line profiles in high resolution high @xmath42 spectra of g and k iii stars ,",

    "this is a significant effect , and a proper exploration of the effect on the stellar parameters determined from sed fitting will require a model grid with a @xmath39 dimension , and is beyond the scope of the current investigation .",

    "[ microt ] that models models in which @xmath39 is over - estimated by 1 km s@xmath40 will produce fits to the blue and near uv band flux level that over - estimate the value of @xmath0 by @xmath48 k. for all models , we adopted a mixing length parameter for the treatment of convective flux transport of one pressure scale height .",
    "[ [ section-6 ] ]    for all models , we adopt scaled solar abundances .",
    "there is evidence that mildly metal poor stars of [ @xmath10@xmath49 have abundance distributions that are enhanced in @xmath5-elements with respect to the sun by 0.2 to 0.3 dex ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "however , given the scope of the model grid required for this initial investigation , we have decided to restrict ourselves to scaled solar @xmath50 distributions",
    ". there has been recent controversy over the values of the solar abundances for important elements such as cno , with @xcite and other papers in that series , revising the values downward by 0.2 to 0.3 dex on the basis of @xmath51 models that account for hydrodynamic turbulence .",
    "however , the work of @xcite has been found to be discrepant with abundances determined from very sensitive helioseismological fitting , and has recently been thrown into question on the grounds of self - consistency ( see , for example , the very thorough recent investigation by @xcite ) . for simplicity , we restrict ourselves in this investigation to the solar abundance distribution of @xcite .",
    "[ [ section-7 ] ]    for each grid point , we compute two models that differ from each other in the choice of atomic line list .",
    "our series 1 and 2 models use the `` big '' and `` small '' line lists of @xcite , respectively , and that paper contains a description of the content of the two line lists , the evidence for and against each one , and an investigation of the effect that the choice of line list has on the computed sed , especially in the heavily line blanketed blue and near uv region .",
    "@xcite found that the choice of `` big '' or `` small '' line list has a significant impact on the computed @xmath4 values in the blue and near uv bands for both the sun and arcturus , and concluded that nlte models of the sun with the `` big '' line list provide a better fit to the measured @xmath4 distribution of @xcite , but that those with the `` small '' line list provide a better fit to three other measured @xmath4 distributions , including one measured from space .",
    "therefore , we have decided to evaluate the fit provided by models with both choices of line list here .",
    "we note that the choice of line list affects the model structure as well as directly affecting the synthetic sed calculation .      for each model in both series 1 and 2",
    "we computed self - consistent synthetic spectra in the @xmath12 range 3000 to 8000    with a spectral resolution ( @xmath52 ) to ensure that spectral lines were adequately sampled .",
    "these were then degraded to match the low resolution measured @xmath4 distributions of b85 by convolution with a gaussian kernel .",
    "b85 present their data with a sampling of 25  , but , neither b85 , nor any of the original source publications that are still accessible , describe the instrumental spectral profile .",
    "based on trial comparisons of observed seds with synthetic @xmath4 spectra convolved with gaussians of various fwhm values , we found that a gaussian instrumental profile with a fwhm value of 75    provided the closest qualitative match to the spectral structure in the observed seds .",
    "therefore , we have convolved all our synthetic spectra with a normalized gaussian kernel of fwhm equal to 75  .",
    "we note that this convolution also automatically accounts for macro - turbulence , which has been found to be around 5.0 km s@xmath53 for g and k ii stars @xcite .",
    "we interpolate in @xmath54 between pairs of synthetic seds to obtain a grid with an effective sampling , @xmath34 , of 62.5 k. a @xmath0 difference of 62.5 k at 3300    corresponds to a difference in the @xmath55 of a blackbody of 0.07 , and this difference will be smaller for larger @xmath12 and higher @xmath0 values . for comparison , the discrepancy in near uv band @xmath55 level between lte models and observations found by @xcite for arcturus around 3300    is @xmath56 .",

    "this result is surprising in that we expect discrepancies due to inconsistencies and inaccuracies in the treatment of line blanketing , among other modeling aspects , to be reduced with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "we do not find such a gross discrepancy at g0 v with the empirical rm05 @xmath0 scale .",
    "our giant sequence samples @xmath0 well from spectral class g5 to k3 - 4 . the @xmath25 value of the best fit to the giant star spectra for all spectral bands increases with later spectral class , with the value for the overall sed increasing from @xmath78 at spectral class g8 iii to @xmath79 at spectral class k3 - 4 iii .",
    "the quality of fit to the red band ( 4600 to 7000  ) is significantly better than that to the blue ( 3200 to 4600  ) , with the best fit @xmath25 value being @xmath80 0.02 for classes g8 to k2 iii .",
    "( unfortunately , a peculiar discrepancy between the observed and synthetic spectra unique to the g5 iii sample prevents us from meaningfully including that sample in conclusions drawn for the red band . )",
    "higher best fit @xmath25 values are driven by an increasing variation around zero in spectra of the difference between observed and synthetic spectra as @xmath12 decreases , and correlates with the increasing density of spectral lines in @xmath4 spectra with decreasing @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , the contrast between the best fit @xmath64 and @xmath65 values probably reflects inadequacies in the input atomic line list and/or the treatment of line formation .",
    "for the series 1 models , there is also a _",
    "systematic _ effect with wavelength in that best fit models to the blue band yield a fitted @xmath0 value that is one @xmath34 grid resolution element ( 63 k ) higher than those fit to the red band .",
    "equivalently , models fitted to the red band will predict too little flux in the blue band .",
    "this result is in stark contrast to the results of @xcite and @xcite , who found that models fitted to the red band of arcturus ( k1.5 iii ) predicted _ too much _ blue band flux .",
    "we note that our series 1 models fitted to the blue band provide @xmath0 values that are within 50 k of the values derived with the phoenix nextgen grid , which also used the `` big '' atomic line list .",
    "the series 2 models ( `` small '' line list ) fitted to the blue band lead to best fit @xmath0 values for the early k giants that are 63 k lower than do the series 1 models ( `` large '' line list ) , thus providing greater consistency of best fit @xmath0 value among the spectral bands than do the series 1 models .",
    "by contrast , for the two spectral classes for which we have reliable dwarf spectra , g0 and g4 - 5 , the series 1 models provide a better fit to the blue band of the dwarfs than those of series 2 , while the two series provide an equally good fit to the red band of dwarfs .",
    "we conclude that there is marginal evidence that the series 2 models provide a better fit to solar metallicity giants while series 1 models provide a better fit to solar metallicity dwarfs .      when comparing giants of the same _ spectral class _ , the models provide a better fit at solar metallicity than at [ @xmath10@xmath49 , however , when comparing giants of the same @xmath0 value , the models give a similar quality of fit at both metallicities . taking into account the metallicity dependence in the @xmath0 calibration of the spectral classes ,",
    "we conclude that the quality of fit provided by our models is not dependent , or only weakly dependent , on [ @xmath10 in the range -0.5 to 0.0 .",
    "we find that arcturus is peculiar among our stars in that it is the _ only _ object for which the best fit @xmath0 value to the blue band is _ lower _ than that for the red band , by 63 k. this result is qualitatively consistent with that of @xcite and @xcite , who found that models fit to the yellow and red bands of arcturus yielded significantly more blue and near uv band flux than observed .",
    "those authors concluded that there is an important source of near uv band continuous opacity missing from cool star atmospheric models . one goal of this work was to determine the extent to which this discrepancy was pervasive among late type stars .",
    "we conclude that it is not , and that arcturus may be peculiar in this regard .",
    "if anything , there is a tendency for models fit to spectra of all other spectral classes to _",
    "under_-predict the blue flux with respect to the red .      for the solar metallicity giants , we find that the series 2 models , which yield consistent @xmath0 values between the red and blue bands , agree to within 100 k with the rm05 empirical @xmath0 values for our full range of spectral classes .",
    "for the k2 to k4 iii stars , we recover the rm05 @xmath0 values to within the @xmath34 resolution of our model grid .",
    "the agreement of the series 2 @xmath0 values with the rm05 values for the g0 and g4 - 5 v stars is also very good . for the metal poor giants , the relative success of series 1 and 2 models",
    "is mixed with g8 and k1.5 iii stars having contrasting results . by contrast ,",
    "the very recently published interferometric @xmath0 values of b10 are in very close agreement to the series 1 models fit to the blue band for early k giants .",
    "we conclude on balance that the series 2 models ( `` small '' atomic line list ) provide greater internal self - consistency and agreement with empirical @xmath0 scale .",
    "we advise that the large atomic line lists containing many theoretically predicted lines of fe - group elements be used with caution .",
    "phoenix includes continuous molecular opacity from h@xmath57 , h@xmath81 , h@xmath82 and mgh .",

    "<S> we present a grid of lte atmospheric models and synthetic spectra that cover the spectral class range from mid - g to mid - k , and luminosity classes from v to iii , that is dense in @xmath0 sampling ( @xmath1 k ) , for stars of solar metallicity and moderately metal poor scaled solar abundance ( @xmath2=0.0 $ ] and @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> all models have been computed with two choices of atomic line list : a ) the `` big '' line lists of @xcite that best reproduce the broad - band solar blue and near uv @xmath4 level , and b ) the `` small '' lists of @xcite that provide the best fit to the high resolution solar blue and near - uv spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our model seds to a sample of stars carefully selected from the large catalog of uniformly re - calibrated spectrophotometry of @xcite with the goal of determining how the quality of fit varies with stellar parameters , especially in the historically troublesome blue and near - uv bands . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm that our models computed with the `` big '' line list recover the derived @xmath0 values of the phoenix nextgen grid , but find that the models computed with the `` small '' line list provide greater internal self - consistency among different spectral bands , and closer agreement with the empirical @xmath0 scale of @xcite , but not to the interferometrically derived @xmath0 values of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find _ no _ evidence that the near uv band discrepancy between models and observations for arcturus ( @xmath5 boo ) reported by @xcite and @xcite is pervasive , and that arcturus may be peculiar in this regard . </S>"
