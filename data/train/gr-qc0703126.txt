    "generalisations of the usual einstein - hilbert action of general relativity ( gr ) have been extensively studied in the literature .",
    "one frequently considered modification is to replace the ricci scalar , @xmath0 , by some analytic function , @xmath1 ( see e.g @xcite ) .",
    "theories of this type are referred to as fourth - order , as the field equations generated from them are generically fourth - order in derivatives of the metric .",
    "motivations for such studies are found from various different sources .",
    "one often cited reason is that early attempts to create a perturbatively renormalizable quantum field theory of gravity found success by adding extra terms , quadratic in the ricci curvature , to the action @xcite .",
    "more recently , the effective actions of some string theories have been shown to include higher - order curvature terms @xcite .",
    "studies of @xmath1 theories have also been performed in cosmological settings , often in attempts to better understand the late - time accelerating expansion of the universe @xcite , cosmological inflation @xcite or the nature of an initial singularity @xcite .",
    "difficulty can arise , in studies of fourth - order theories , as the field equations involved are considerably more complex than their counterparts in gr .",
    "this extra complexity brings new and interesting behaviour , such as violations of birkhoff s theorem @xcite or violations of the no hair theorems of de sitter space , @xcite .",
    "however , this extra complexity also makes it even more difficult to find exact solutions of the field equations . whilst some exact solutions have been found in the spherically symmetric @xcite and cosmological @xcite situations , these are all particular solutions . to date",
    ", there have been no general solutions published in the literature , for any set of non - maximal symmetries .",
    "exact solutions , and particularly exact general solutions , are of great importance for understanding a theory . in this paper",
    "we will present homogeneous and isotropic exact general solutions , obtained through direct integration of the field equations , to some fourth - order theories of gravity .",
    "we expect these solutions to be of use for helping to understand fourth - order theories of gravity , and the evolution of the universes they govern .",
    "investigations of fourth - order theories usually follow one of two approaches : either they take the full - theory and look for approximate solutions , or they approximate the theory and look for exact solutions .",
    "we will take the later approach and consider theories that have a lagrangian proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "such theories are scale invariant , and reduce to gr in the limit @xmath3 .",
    "these theories may be considered as the limit of a more general lagrangian that has a power of @xmath0 dominating in some particular regime , or as a simple deviation from the standard theory in their own right .",
    "we find that for homogeneous and isotropic cosmologies the field equations of these theories can often be integrated directly . for spatially flat vacuum cosmologies",
    "the general solution can be found for any @xmath4 , for spatially curved vacuum cosmologies we find the general solutions when @xmath5 , and for spatially flat perfect fluid cosmologies ( with equation of state @xmath6 ) we find the general solutions when @xmath7 and when @xmath8 .",
    "these dependences are shown graphically in figure [ deltaplot ] , below .",
    "investigations of homogeneous and isotropic cosmologies in @xmath2 theories have been performed before in @xcite . in these papers",
    "the authors find power - law exact , particular solutions and perform a dynamical systems analysis of the phase space of more general solutions .",
    "these studies show that the general solutions are often attracted to simple power - law solutions , at both late and early times",
    ". we will confirm this behaviour here , and add to the previous work by finding explicit expressions for the general evolution of these universes .",
    "we will now comment on the extent to which the solutions found in this paper can be considered candidates for the description of our universe .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite and @xcite that gravitational theories derived from a lagrangian of the form @xmath2 are constrained by observations in our local universe to have @xmath4 very close to @xmath9 .",
    "it has also been suggested ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) that it may not be possible for general @xmath1 theories of gravity to transition between eras dominated by different fluids in the same way that occurs in the usual general relativistic description .",
    "these results suggest that our neighbourhood of space - time should be well described by a theory that is very close to the einstein - hilbert one .",
    "however , with these constraints in mind , there are still good reasons to be interested in deviations of the @xmath2 form .",
    "firstly , even if @xmath4 is very tightly constrained by local observations , any small deviation from @xmath10 may produce significant deviations at early times in the universe s history .",
    "this will be shown explicitly below .",
    "secondly , theories of the type @xmath11 are often considered in the literature .",
    "if @xmath12 then we may expect the effective gravitational theory in the early universe to be well described by a lagrangian of the form @xmath2 .",
    "in such cases a more appropriate description of the evolution of the early universe would be given by an @xmath2 theory , even though observations from our local universe show strong agreement with an effective theory of the einstein - hilbert type .",
    "this paper will proceed as follows . in section 2",
    "we will give the field equations for the theory , and show how they can be simplified by recasting them in terms of new variables and transforming time coordinates .",
    "simple power - law exact , particular solutions to these equations are given . in section 3",
    "we show how the field equations for vacuum cosmologies can be decoupled by a further transformation of variables .",
    "these equations are then integrated directly , and the solutions given explicitly in terms of the metric .",
    "section 4 follows a similar prescription , this time solving the field equations in the presence of a perfect fluid . in section 5",
    "we perform a brief analysis of the vacuum solutions , and in section 6 we analyse the perfect fluid solutions .",
    "section 7 provides a closing discussion . for readers interested in the solutions , but not the derivations , the solutions in sections 3 and 4",
    "are boxed to make them easily identifiable .",
    "we consider here a gravitational theory derived from the lagrangian density @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a real number and @xmath15 is a constant .",
    "the limit @xmath16 gives the einstein - hilbert lagrangian of gr , and we are interested in isotropic and homogeneous cosmological solutions with @xmath17 . theories of this kind are dynamically equivalent to scalar - tensor theories ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we denote the matter action as @xmath18 and ignore the boundary term . extremizing @xmath19with respect to the metric @xmath20 , then gives @xcite @xmath21where @xmath22 is the energy ",
    "momentum tensor of the matter fields , and is defined in terms of @xmath18 and @xmath20 in the usual way .",
    "we take the quantity @xmath23 to be the positive real root of @xmath24 .",
    "we are concerned with idealised homogeneous and isotropic space - times described by the friedmann - robertson - walker metric with spatial curvature parameter @xmath25 : @xmath26substituting this metric ansatz into the field equations ( [ field ] ) , and assuming the universe to be filled with a perfect fluid of pressure @xmath27 and density @xmath28 , gives the generalised version of the friedmann equations @xmath29 where , as usual , @xmath30 it can be seen that in the limit @xmath16 these equations reduce to the standard friedmann equations of gr .",
    "a study of the vacuum solutions to these equations has been made by schmidt , see the review @xcite , and a study of the perfect - fluid evolution has been made by carloni et al @xcite . in @xcite clifton and barrow investigated solutions when @xmath31 , and showed that attractor power - law solutions exist .",
    "various conclusions are also immediate from the general analysis of @xmath1 lagrangians made in @xcite by specialising them to the case @xmath32 .",
    "these previous studies have focussed on the existence of particular exact solutions , or qualitative investigations of the phase space of general solutions . in",
    "what follows we shall be interested in determining the general evolution of @xmath33 in terms of explicit , exact solutions .",
    "this should lead to fresh insights into the evolution of universes described by these theories .    assuming a perfect - fluid equation of state of the form @xmath34",
    ", the usual conservation equation gives @xmath35 .",
    "substituting this into equations ( [ friedman1 ] ) and ( [ friedman2 ] ) , with @xmath36 , gives the particular power - law exact friedmann solution , for @xmath37 , @xmath38 alternatively , if @xmath39 , there exists the de sitter solution @xmath40 .",
    "these power - law solutions reduce to the usual general relativistic solutions in the limit @xmath16 . furthermore , the power - law solutions @xmath41 and @xmath42 also exist .",
    "these solutions are independent of @xmath43 , and therefore of the matter content of the universe .",
    "the @xmath44 limit of ( [ power2 ] ) clearly corresponds to minkowski space .",
    "these three particular solutions were both shown in @xcite to be attractors of the spatially flat general solution , under certain conditions . in",
    "what follows we will be able to show this attractor explicitly in terms of exact general solutions .",
    "the equations ( [ friedman1 ] ) , ( [ friedman2 ] ) and ( [ r2 ] ) can be cast in a simpler form by defining the new variables r^ |ae^/2 a. transforming to the time coordinate d e^/2 dt and setting @xmath45 we then have two second - order evolution equations , for the two variables @xmath46 and @xmath47 , @xmath48 and the constraint equation [ 3 ] 6 = + v_0 e^- - + e^ ( -4/3 ) /2 where v_0 =  ( r ) = .",
    "over - dots here denote differentiation with respect to @xmath49 . in rescaling time in this way we must remember that the more physically significant cosmological time coordinate @xmath50",
    "may diverge at finite values of the new time coordinate .",
    "in such cases we will consider @xmath50 as the more physically meaningful time , and allow the new coordinate to take values only over an appropriate range .",
    "this set of equations is similar to those obtained in gr , when considering homogeneous and isotropic cosmologies with a scalar field in an exponential potential , and a perfect fluid .",
    "this similarity is due to the conformal equivalence between @xmath1 theories of gravity and gr ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "one should notice , however , that the terms corresponding to the perfect fluid have a more complicated form than may have otherwise been obtained in gr ( except for the special case of black - body radiation , @xmath51 , which is conformally invariant ) .",
    "the corresponding set of equations in gr has been solved in vacuum by russo @xcite , and in the presence of a perfect fluid by dehnen , gavrilov and melnikov @xcite .",
    "in the absence of any matter fields the equations ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) are identical to homogeneous and isotropic general relativistic cosmologies , with a scalar field in an exponential potential .",
    "the spatially flat general solutions to these equations have already been found by russo @xcite . here we will briefly reiterate the method of solving these equations , and use the results to find the general solution to spatially flat vacuum cosmologies in @xmath2 gravity .",
    "firstly , making the transformation of variables @xmath52 by the definitions |a^3 e^v+u ( v - u ) and defining the new time coordinate de^ dallows the evolution equations ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) to be written as @xmath53 where over - dots now denote differentiation with respect to @xmath54",
    ". in terms of these new variables , the constraint equation ( [ 3 ] ) reads [ 3b ] = .",
    "we will first solve for two special cases , and then give the solutions for more general cases .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    the special case @xmath55 ( corresponding to @xmath56 ) gives the solutions to equations ( [ 1b ] ) and ( [ 2b ] ) , under the constraint ( [ 3b ] ) , as u= c_1 + ( + c_2 ) v = c_3 + ( + c_2)^2 where the @xmath57 are constants .",
    "transforming these results back , and absorbing constants into redefinitions of the coordinates , gives the metric [ vac1/2 ] where @xmath58 is the line - element of flat three dimensional euclidean space .",
    "the @xmath59 sign here is due to the dependence of @xmath60 on the sign of the ricci scalar .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    the case @xmath61 ( corresponding to @xmath62 ) is also special and gives the solutions u = c_4 + ( + c_5)^2 v= c_6 + ( + c_5 ) i.e. the same as the solutions in the previous case , under the exchange of @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
