    "if gas still persists in the disk , the core can attract a thick atmosphere and form into a gas giant planet ; the disk is also viscous so that the planet tends to migrate inwards @xcite . for sparse refractories , however ,",
    "only small comets up to neptune - like ` ice giants ' may have formed when the gas disperses ; @xcite suggested that such systems will be characterised by planetesimal collisions and hence debris emission .",
    "here we classify these outcomes from most to least successful , and postulate that the _ dominant _ agent is the initial mass in refractories .",
    "we aim to test whether one underlying property has a highly significant effect on the outcome , and so intentionally ignore other properties that could affect the planetary system formed around an individual star .",
    "such properties include the disk size , geometry , composition and lifetime , as well as the stellar accretion rate , emission spectrum and environment .",
    "stochastic effects are also neglected , such as inwards migration caused by inter - planet encounters @xcite and debris brightening after collisions of major planetesimals @xcite .",

    "the hypothesis explored here is that the mass of solid elements in a primordial circumstellar disk can be quantified , and linked to an outcome such as a detectable debris disk or radial velocity planet .",
    "the only piece of relevant ` relic ' information for a particular star is the metallicity , quantified by [ fe / h ] , the logarithmic abundance of iron with respect to hydrogen and normalised to the solar value , and this quantity is taken here to track refractories in general . in combination with a distribution of total ( gas - plus - dust ) masses of primordial disks , masses of solids can then be inferred statistically .",
    "our basic hypothesis is that the metallicity is a relic quantity originally common to the young star and its disk , and that higher values of the trace refractory iron should correlate with more effective planet growth .",
    "it is well - known that gas giant detection rates rise at higher [ fe / h ] ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g ) , while @xcite have noted that debris detection is essentially independent of metallicity .",
    "@xcite have shown that the growth of gas giant planets can be reproduced in simulations taking disk mass and metal content into account . here",
    "we extend such ideas to include systems with doppler planets , with debris disks , and with both phenomena .",

    "the overlap of the two distributions is in fact an integral part of our model , where _ two _ factors contribute to the outcome . ] ranked from most to least successful : a ) hot jupiters , b ) more distant doppler planets , with semi - major axis beyond 0.1  au , c ) systems with both giant planets and debris , and d ) stars with debris only . here",
    "we base ` success ' ( implicitly , via core - accretion models ) on a large supply of refractories and so fast evolutionary timescales , with hot jupiters rapidly building a core , adding an atmosphere and migrating substantially towards the star . in systems with",
    "progessively less success : planets form more slowly so they migrate less over the remaining disk lifetime ( cool jupiters ) ; only some of the material is formed into planets ( planet - and - debris systems ) ; and mainly planetesimals are formed , perhaps with planets up to ice - giant size ( debris ) .",
    "the 0.1  au divide of hot / cool jupiters is not necessarily physical , and is simply intended to give reasonable source counts .",
    "notably , in systems with debris plus jupiters , the planets orbit at @xmath1 0.5 au , consistent with even lower success in migration .",
    "the plotted ranges of [ fe / h ] shift globally to higher values with more success , as expected  however , the ranges also overlap indicating that the fraction of metallic elements is not the only relevant quantity .",
    "the hypothesis to be tested here is that the underlying dominant factor is the _ total mass _ of metals in the primordial disk .",
    "this mass is the product of the total mass m of the disk ( largely in h@xmath2 gas ) and the mass - fraction z of refractory elements .",
    "the range of z for each outcome is broad because disks of different m were initially present ; thus , a massive low - metal disk and a low - mass metal - rich disk could both lead to the same outcome .",
    "the distribution of the product m@xmath3 m z was constructed from a mass distribution measured for primordial disks @xcite and our metal abundances measured in nearby sun - like stars @xcite . with the canonical gas - to - dust mass ratio of 100 for present - day disks ,",

    "our model has the following assumptions .",
    "* there are contiguous bands of the m@xmath6 distribution , corresponding to different planetary system outcomes .",
    "any one disk has an outcome solely predicted by its value of m@xmath6 .",
    "the ranges of m and z can overlap , as only the m@xmath6 bands are required to be contiguous .",
    "* a particular outcome will arise from a set of m z products , with the observable quantity being the metallicity ranging from z(low ) to z(high ) .",
    "this z - range sets the m@xmath6 bounds , as described below .",
    "* for the stellar ensemble , all possible products are assumed to occur , and to produce some outcome that is actually observed .",
    "there are no unknown outcomes ( novel kinds of planetary system not yet observed ) . *",
    "m and z are taken to be independent , as the disk mass is presumably a dynamical property of the young star - disk system and the mass in solids is always a small component .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the m@xmath6 bounds were determined using the minimum number of free parameters . for a particular outcome , the observed z - range is assumed to trace the bounds of m@xmath6 , i.e. @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a constant , and this relation sets solid - mass bounds for each outcome .",
    "results presented here are mainly for @xmath9 , but more complex relationships could exist , and other simple assumptions without further variables could also have been made  alternative forms of eq .",
    "2 are explored in section 4.1    absolute values for m@xmath6 were derived iteratively , working downwards from the most successful outcome .",
    "the upper bound for the hot jupiter band was derived from the highest disk mass observed and highest metallicity seen for this outcome ( under the assumption that all m z products are observed ) .",
    "other outcomes were then derived in turn assuming @xmath9 , and working down in order of success , with each lower bound m@xmath6(low ) setting the upper bound m@xmath6(high ) for the next most successful outcome .",
    "both m and z have log - normal distributions , and 10@xmath10 outcomes were calculated , based on 1000 equally - likely values of log(m ) combined with 1000 equally - probable values of log(z ) , i.e. [ fe / h ] .",
    "the m - distribution is taken from a deep millimetre - wavelength survey for dust in disks in the taurus star - forming region by @xcite .",
    "@xcite have found similar results from ( less deep ) surveys of other regions , so the taurus results are taken here to be generic , under the simplification that local environment is neglected .",
    "the total disk masses m were found from the dust masses multiplied by a standard gas - to - dust mass ratio of 100 .",
    "the mean of the log - normal total disk masses is 1 jupiter mass ( i.e. log m = 0 in m@xmath11 units ) with a standard deviation of 1.15 dex , and detections were actually made down to @xmath12 .",
    "the z - distribution is from the volume - limited sample from @xcite of main sequence sun - like stars ( f , g , k dwarfs ) within 18 pc .",
    "these authors also list 850 similar stars out to larger distances that are being actively searched for doppler planets . in the 18 pc sample ,",
    "the mean in logarithmic [ fe / h ] is 0.06 and the standard deviation is 0.25 dex .",
    "both m and z distributions have an upper cutoff at approximately the @xmath13 bound : for m this is because disks are less massive than @xmath14  % of the star s mass ( presumably for dynamical stability ) , and for z because the galaxy has a metal threshold determined by nucleosynthetic enrichment by previous generations of stars .",
    "the upper cutoff for m is 200 m@xmath11 for ` classical t tauri ' stars , and for z the adopted cutoff in [ fe / h ] is + 0.40 from the 18 pc sample ( with a few planet - hosts of [ fe / h ] up to 0.56 found in larger volumes ) .",
    "the doppler - detection frequencies quoted in table 1 are mostly from the set of 850 uniformly - searched stars with [ fe / h ] values .",
    "the statistics for hot jupiters range from 16/1330 = 1.2  % in a single - team search @xcite up to 22/850 = 2.6  % in the uniform dataset @xcite .",
    "for cool jupiters ( outside 0.1 au semi - major axis ) , the counts are 76/850 = 8.9  % @xcite , with @xcite finding a range from 72/1330 = 5.4  % within 5 au up to an extrapolation of 11  % within 20 au .",
    "the upper limit is based on long - term trends in the radial velocity data , and these as - yet unconfirmed planetary systems could have [ fe / h ] bounds beyond those quoted here .",
    "the debris counts are based on our surveys with spitzer .",
    "the debris - only statistics @xcite comprise 25 spitzer detections out of 169 target stars in unbiased surveys , i.e. 15 @xmath15 3  % with poissonian errors . for planet - plus - debris systems ,",
    "the 3  % frequency is estimated from 6/25 detections ( 24 @xmath15 10  % ) among stars known to have doppler planets @xcite , multiplied by the 12  % total extrapolated planet frequency @xcite . in table 1",
    ", the planet - only rates should strictly sum to only up to 9  % if this estimate of 3  % of planet - and - debris systems is subtracted .",
    "the null set quoted has an [ fe / h ] range derived from our spitzer targets where no debris or planet has been detected .",
    "the m@xmath6(low ) bound for the null set has been set to zero rather than the formal limit derived from z(low)/z(high ) , as lower values of m@xmath6(low ) presumably also give no presently observable outcome .",
    "the predicted frequencies ( table 1 ) agree closely with the observed rates in _ all _ outcome categories .",
    "this is remarkable when very different planetary systems are observed by independent methods , and ranging in scale from under a tenth to tens of au .",
    "the good agreement suggest that solid mass may indeed be the dominant predictor of outcome .",
    "the model is also rather robust . in particular , because the m - distribution is an independent datum , obtaining a good match of predicted and observed frequencies is not inevitable .",
    "for example , artificially halving the standard deviation of the m distribution would yield far too many stars with detectable systems ( 75  % ) , and many more cool jupiters than hot jupiters ( around 20:1 instead of 5:1 ) .",
    "the model is also reasonably independent of outlier data points .",
    "for example , adding in the low - metallicity system neglected in figure  1 would raise the prediction for cool jupiters from 8  % to 12  % , or extending the upper z - cutoff to the [ fe / h ] of the distant doppler systems would raise this prediction to 11  % .",
    "however , the resulting effects on the less - successful system probabilities are less than 1  % .",
    "this suggests that although small number statistics may affect the predictions , the results would not greatly differ if large populations were available , that could be described by statistical bounds rather than minimum- to maximum-[fe / h ] .",
    "the model also accounts for nearly all outcomes , as required if each m@xmath6 is to result in only one planetary system architecture . for a few m@xmath6 products , one of the outcomes",
    "would be expected except that the z value involved lies outside the observed ranges .",
    "these anomalous systems sum to 9  % ( hence the table 1 predictions add to @xmath16  % ) . these ` missing ' systems are predominantly debris and debris - plus - planet outcomes .",
    "the latter class has the smallest number of detections ( figure  1 ) , and more examples are likely to be discovered with publication of more distant doppler planets .",
    "a further check is that the disk masses are realistic , in terms of producing the observed bodies .",
    "doppler systems are predicted here to form from 5 - 200 jupiter masses of gas in the disk , enough to make gas giant planets .",
    "also , the m@xmath6 values of 30 - 1600 earth - masses could readily supply the cores of jupiter and saturn ( quoted by @xcite as @xmath17 and @xmath18 m@xmath19 respectively ) or the more extreme @xmath20 m@xmath19 core deduced for the transiting hot jupiter around hd  149026 @xcite .",
    "similarly , populations of colliding bodies generating debris have been estimated at @xmath5  130 earth - masses @xcite , a quantity that could reasonably be produced from 575 earth - masses in primordial solids ( table 1 ) .    to make jupiter analogues within realistic timescales , core growth models (",
    "* e.g ) need a few times the minimum mass solar nebula , which comprised approximately 20 m@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the solar system itself would thus have contained a few times 0.2 m@xmath11 in solids , of which 0.15 m@xmath11 ( 50 m@xmath19 ) has been incorporated in planetary cores .",
    "these primordial disk masses would place the solar system in the cool jupiter category , and this is in fact how it would appear externally ( the dust belt being more tenuous than in detected exo - systems ) .",
    "equation ( 2 ) was further investigated with @xmath21 .",
    "reasonable agreement with the observations was obtained only for @xmath8 in a narrow range , @xmath22 . for higher @xmath8 ,",
    "systems with debris are over - produced , while for lower @xmath8 there are too few doppler detections .",
    "this suggests that the hypothesis that the z - range directly traces the m@xmath6 range for the outcome to occur is close to correct , although not well understood .",
    "qualitatively , there is a locus of points in m , z parameter space that lie inside the appropriate m@xmath6 bounds for an outcome , and at some mid - range value of m it is likely that all the z(low ) to z(high ) values are appropriate , and so this traces the product m@xmath6(high ) to m@xmath6(low ) ( provided no more extreme values of z are suitable at the extrema of m ) .",
    "z seems to have the most constrictive effect on outcome because the distribution is much narrower than that of m , and thus if m changes by a large amount , there is no corresponding value of z than can preserve a similar @xmath23 .",
    "simulations of planetesimal growth as a function of mass of solids in the disk are needed to further explore why the ranges of z and @xmath23 match so closely .",
    "one even simpler model was tested , with a constant range of @xmath24 for each observable outcome . assuming that @xmath25  m@xmath19 of solids is needed for the minimum detectable system ( planetesimals creating debris ) , and that the most massive disks contain 1600  m@xmath19 of solids ( from the maximum m and z ) , then this mass range can be divided into equal parts for the four observable outcomes , with a range of log - m  =  0.8 for each .",
    "this simple model fails , in particular greatly over - producing debris - and - planet systems at 12  % .",
    "thus , it seems that the z - range does in fact contain information on the outcomes .",
    "the dependences on metallicity of planet and debris detections arise naturally in the model .",
    "doppler detections are strongly affected by metallicity : @xcite find that the probability is proportional to the square of the number of iron atoms .",
    "our model predicts p(hot jupiter ) @xmath26 n(fe)@xmath27 and p(cool jupiter ) @xmath26 n(fe)@xmath28 , above 80  % - and 30  % -solar iron content respectively .",
    "the observed exponent of 2 for all planets is intermediate between the two model values , and as predicted by @xcite , a steeper trend for short - period planets is perhaps seen , at least at high metallicities ( figure  1 ) .",
    "these dependences arise because large solid masses are needed for fast gas giant formation with time for subsequent migration , and so when [ fe / h ] is low a large total disk mass is required , with rapidly decreasing probability in the upper tail of the m - distribution .",
    "in contrast , the model predicts a weak relation of p(debris ) @xmath26 n(fe)@xmath29 ( for 30 - 160  % -solar iron ) , agreeing with the lack of correlation seen by @xcite . as fewer solids are needed to make comets ,",
    "a wide variety of parent disks will contain enough material , so little metal - dependence is expected .",
    "for example ( table  1 ) , m@xmath6(low ) can result from a 6 m@xmath11 disk with [ fe / h ] of 0.5 or a 1.2 m@xmath11 disk with [ fe / h ] of + 0.2 .",
    "as these masses are both central in the broad m - distribution , they have similar probability , and so the two [ fe / h ] values occur with similar likelihood .",
    "the excellent reproduction of observed frequencies and dependencies on metallicity both suggest that the method is robust .",
    "hence , rather surprisingly , the original search for a single parameter that has a dominant effect on outcome has succeeded . under the assumption that the metallicity ranges track the different outcomes , the primordial solid mass of the circumstellar disk is identified as this parameter .",
    "one implication is that for an ensemble of stars of known metallicity , the proportions of different kinds of planetary system may be predicted , without the need for detailed models of individual disks . as main - sequence stars retain no relic information on their primordial disk masses ,",
    "this is a very useful result , leading to estimates of the frequency and variety of planetary systems , for example among nearby sun - analogues of interest to planet - detection missions .",
    "[ fig2 ]     the model may also be used to examine other planetary system regimes that have just opened up to experiment .",
    "for example , transiting hot jupiters have not been detected in globular clusters , although the stellar density allows searches of many stars . in 47  tuc",
    ", no transits were found amongst @xmath30 stars , although 7 detections would be expected based on the typical hot jupiter occurrence rate @xcite . assuming these old stars formed with disks following the standard m - distribution , but with metallicities of only one - fifth solar in a narrow range with @xmath310.05 dex @xcite , then the model predicts that less than 1 in 10@xmath10 disks can form a hot jupiter ",
    "the solid masses are too small for fast planet growth and subsequent migration .",
    "finally , an upper limit can be estimated for the number of young disks that could form an earth - mass planet . the maximum fraction ( figure  2 )",
    "is set by disks of m@xmath32  m@xmath19 , summing to two - thirds of stars .",
    "thus one in three stars would not be expected to host any earth - analogue , and irrespective of metallicity since the occurrence of this minimum mass is rather flat with p @xmath26 n(fe)@xmath33 . however",
    ", if the upper two - thirds of disks may be able to form terrestrial planets , this would agree with the large numbers predicted by the simulations of @xcite , and also with the first planetary detections by the microlensing method .",
    "two bodies of only around 5 and 13 earth - masses have been detected around low - mass stars , and @xcite estimate a frequency of 0.37 ( 0.21 , + 0.30 ) in this regime of icy planets orbiting at @xmath34  au .",
    "our model finds that 40  % of stars have disks with m@xmath6 greater than 5  m@xmath19 , so the minimum materials to form such planets are present at about the observed frequency . while very preliminary , this result supports the prediction that many stars could have low - mass planets .",
    "we tested the hypothesis that a single underlying parameter could have the dominant effect on the outcome of planetary system formation from primordial circumstellar disks . an empirical model with the mass of solids as this parameter produces a very good match to the observed frequencies and to the dependence on host - star metallicity , when the metallicity range within each outcome is used to estimate the solid - mass range .",
    "this model may be very useful for making statistical predictions of planetary system architectures for ensembles of stars of known metallicity , such as nearby solar analogues of interest to exo - earth detection missions .",
