    "one of them is the model of iterative map that appears in many different contexts , including discrete - event / discrete - time / hybrid systems , qualitative biological models , chaos - based cryptography , etc @xcite .",

    "the reachability in pam is a problem to decide for a given @xmath2 and two rational points @xmath9 and @xmath12 whether @xmath12 is reachable from @xmath9 .",
    "in other words , is there an @xmath13 such that @xmath14 ?",
    "the decidability of the reachability problem for one dimensional piecewise - affine map is still an open problem , which is related to other challenging questions in the theory of computation , number theory and linear algebra @xcite .",
    "this model plays a crucial role in the recent research about verification of hybrid systems @xcite , timed automata @xcite control systems @xcite , representation of numbers in a rational base ( @xmath1-expansions ) @xcite , discounted sum automata @xcite .",
    "in particular pam is often used as a reference model to show the openness of the reachability questions in other systems .",

    "the reachability problem for one - dimensional pam is still open even if we define it with only two intervals @xcite .",
    "the primary goal of this paper is to demonstrate new approaches for solving reachability problem in pams , connecting reachability questions with topological properties of maps and widening connections with other important theoretical computer science problems .",
    "first , we show new techniques for decidability of the reachability problem in pams based on @xmath0-adic norms and weights .",
    "we illustrate these techniques showing decidability of two classes of pams .",
    "the algorithm in theorem  [ th1 ] solves point to point reachability problem for two - interval injective pam under the assumption that a pam has bounded invariant densities . while our numerical experiments shows that the sequence of invariant densities converge to smooth functions it is not yet clear whether it holds for all pams or if not whether this property can be algorithmically checked .",
    "following the proposed approach based on @xmath0-adic weights in theorem  [ th2 ] we define another fragment of pams for which the reachability problem is decidable .",
    "in particularly we remove the condition on bounded invariant densities and injectivity of piecewise - affine map and consider a pam @xmath2 with a constraint on linear coefficients in affine maps . this class of pams is also related to encoding of rational numbers in the rational base ( @xmath1-expansions ) .",
    "the decidability of the point - to - point problem for this class is shown in theorem  [ th2 ] and decidability of point - to - set problem for the same class can give someone an answer to the open problem related to @xmath1-expansions .",

    "note that when @xmath369 we have @xmath370 .",

    "if hypothesis  [ conda ] holds then for any rational number its deterministic @xmath1-expansion is either eventually periodic or it contains all possible patterns ( finite subsequences of digits ) from @xmath379 .",
    "the statement is obvious as hypothesis  [ conda ] implies that the orbit is either periodic or it is dense and the dense orbit is visiting all intervals .",
    "it looks that the point - to - interval problem is harder than the point - to - point reachability problem for the expanding pams , as for example theorem  [ th2 ] gives an algorithm for the point - to - point reachability problem in the @xmath1-expansion pams , but not for the point - to - interval reachability that is equivalent to the @xmath1-expansion problem .",
    "note that in the @xmath1-expansion pams all linear coefficients are the same , so the density of the orbit correspond to the density of the following sequence @xmath380 , where @xmath381 .",

    "two points of the plane are defined to be equivalent if they belong to a same line passing through the origin .",
    "we call @xmath215 as homogeneous coordinate of a point @xmath392 if @xmath404 . by @xmath405",
    "we denote the set of homogeneous coordinates of all points from @xmath406 .",
    "the sequence @xmath407 is dense in @xmath115 if and only if for any interval @xmath399 there are @xmath57 and @xmath120 , such that the line @xmath408 intersects the set @xmath409 .",
    "it is known that @xmath410 for any interval @xmath399 , i.e. for any irrational @xmath411 the line @xmath412 intersect the set @xmath413 .",

    "however in order to study and describe previously mentioned problems such as the target discounted - sum problem , pams reachability problems , the mahler s @xmath388 problem we require the notion of  dynamic intervals  .",
    "let @xmath415 be a sequence of numbers from @xmath115 .",
    "what is the distribution of a sequence @xmath416 , where @xmath417 is a non - decreasing sequence ?",

    "let us assume that @xmath422 and @xmath423 is a non - decreasing sequence , @xmath424 .",
    "now we define `` dynamical intervals '' as an evolving infinite sequence @xmath425 , @xmath426 , @xmath427 , @xmath189 : @xmath428 by @xmath429 we denote a function representing a frequency of hitting dynamical interval @xmath430 by the sequence @xmath431 . in contrast to @xmath432 which only counts the number of hittings to a fixed interval @xmath118 , our new function",

    "the equidistribution theorem states that the sequence @xmath439 , @xmath440 , @xmath441 , @xmath189 is uniformly distributed on the circle @xmath442 , when @xmath74 is an irrational number .",
    "it gives us the fact that each significant digit of numbers in ( @xmath443 ) sequence will correspond to the interval @xmath442 and the length of the interval related to the frequency for each appearing digit .",
    "however the question about the distribution of the sequence @xmath444 is different in the way that it is not about the distribution of the first digits of @xmath445 in base @xmath80 , i.e. not about the distribution of the sequence @xmath446 , but related to the sequence of digits after some shift of the number @xmath446 corresponding to the multiplication by a power of @xmath80 .",
    "so in the above notations the distribution of numbers in the sequence @xmath447 corresponds to the @xmath448 for the logarithmic ( benford s law ) distributed sequence @xmath449 , @xmath450 and @xmath451 .",
    "now we will show that even if the sequence @xmath439 , @xmath440 , @xmath441 , @xmath189 is uniformly distributed on the circle @xmath442 , the irrationality of @xmath215 is not enough to guarantee uniform distribution or even density of the sequence @xmath452 on the circle corresponding to the linear shifts @xmath453 .",
    "let us prove that when @xmath468 the inequality @xmath461 if and only if @xmath469 . the implication from left to right follows from @xmath470 .",

    "when @xmath480 the statement is trivial .",
    "let us assume that it holds for @xmath481 .",
