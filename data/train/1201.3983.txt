    "this result is relatively robust if population evolution deviates from the wright - fisher model ( see @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "however , there is evidence that there are populations where the gene genealogy of a sample is not described well by kingman s @xmath4-coalescent . examples of such populations can be found in maritime species , where one individual can have a huge number of offspring with non - negligible probability ( see @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "a whole class of potential models for the gene genealogy of a sample was introduced independently by pitman and sagitov ( see @xcite and @xcite ) : the class of @xmath4-coalescents with multiple collisions .",
    "a @xmath4-coalescent with multiple collisions is a continuous - time markov process with state space @xmath8 , where all possible transitions are done by merging two or more blocks of the current state into one new block .",
