    "the method of smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) was developed in the late 1970s by @xcite and @xcite as a numerical tool for solving the equations of gravitohydrodynamics in three - dimensional open space .",
    "today , the use of sph spans many areas of astrophysics and cosmology as well as a broad range of fluid and solid mechanics related areas .",
    "however , despite its extensive applications and recent progress in consolidating its theoretical foundations , sph still has unknown properties that need to be investigated .",
    "a fundamental numerical aspect of sph is the lack of particle consistency , which affects the accuracy and convergence of the method .",
    "several modified techniques and corrective methods have been proposed to restore particle consistency in fluid dynamics calculations @xcite ; the most successful ones being those based on taylor series expansions of the kernel approximations of a function and its derivatives . if @xmath10 derivatives are retained in the series expansions , the resulting kernel and particle approximations will have ( @xmath11)th - order accuracy or @xmath12 consistency .",
    "however , the improved accuracy of these methods comes at the price of involving matrix inversions , which represent a major computational burden for time - evolving simulations and eventually a loss of numerical stability due to matrix conditioning for some specific problems . on the other hand , while these corrective methods solve for particle inconsistency due to truncation of the kernel at model boundaries , it is not clear how irregular particle distributions and the use of variable smoothing lengths affect the consistency ( and therefore the accuracy ) of the solutions .",
    "recently , @xcite showed that the condition for the particle approximation to restore @xmath7 consistency and achieve asymptotic error decay is that the volumes defined by the particles and the inter - particle faces partition the entire domain , i.e. , constitute a partition of unity .",
    "they found that this condition is satisfied by relaxing the particles under a constant pressure field by keeping the particle volumes invariant , yielding convergence rates for such a relaxed distribution that are the same as those for particles on a perfect regular lattice .",
    "quite curiously , they also observed that the relaxed particle distributions obtained this way resemble that of liquid molecules resulting from microscopic simulations . a method to improve the sph estimate of derivatives which is not affected by particle disorder",
    "was also devised recently by @xcite .    in comparison",
    "little work has been done to improve the sph consistency in astrophysical applications . in many cases , especially those involving self - gravitating flows ,",
    "large density gradients arise and an adaptive kernel is used to guarantee spatial resolution in regions of high density . it has long been recognized that spatially adaptive calculations where a variable smoothing length is employed turn out to be inconsistent @xcite .",
    "it was not until recently that @xcite identified another source of particle inconsistency associated with the finite number of neighbors within the compact support of a smoothed function .",
    "it is common practice in sph calculations to assume that a large number of total particles , @xmath0 , and a small smoothing length , @xmath2 , are sufficient conditions to achieve consistent solutions , while holding the number of neighbor particles , @xmath1 , fixed at some value @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that @xmath7 particle consistency , i.e. , satisfaction of the discrete normalization condition of the kernel function can only be achieved when @xmath1 is sufficiently large for which the finite sph sum approximation approaches the continuous limit .",
    "this result is consistent with the error analysis of the sph representation of the continuity and momentum equations carried out by @xcite , who found that particle consistency is completely lost due to zeroth - order error terms that would persist when working with a finite number of neighbors even though @xmath3 and @xmath4 . indeed , as the resolution is increased , approaching the limit @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the overall error will grow at a faster rate if the magnitude of the zeroth - order error terms remains constant .",
    "based on these observations , full particle consistency is possible in sph only if the joint limit @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is satisfied @xcite .",
    "however , we recall that this combined limit was first noted by @xcite using a simple linear analysis on one - dimensional sound wave propagation .",
    "in particular , he found that sph is fully consistent in this limit with @xmath3 faster than @xmath1 such that @xmath6 .    on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite conjectured that for quasi - regularly distributed particles , the discretization error made when passing from the continuous kernel to the particle approximation is proportional to @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the dimension .",
    "for @xmath16 , @xcite parameterized this error as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 varies from 0.5 for a random distribution to 1 for a perfectly regular lattice of particles . combining this with the leading error ( @xmath19 ) of the continuous kernel approximation for",
    "most commonly used kernel forms , @xcite derived the scaling relations @xmath20 and @xmath21 , which satisfy the joint limit as the domain resolution is progressively increased . a recent analysis on standard",
    "sph has demonstrated that using the above scalings @xmath7 consistency is fully restored for both the estimates of the function and its derivatives in contrast to the case where @xmath1 is fixed to a constant small value , with the numerical solution becoming also insensitive to the degree of particle disorder @xcite .",
    "while these results are promising , it remains to investigate the response of the method for spatially adaptive calculations in the presence of large gradients where the loss of particle consistency is known to be most extreme .",
    "in particular , most of the above analyses are based on static convergence tests for analytical functions in two- or three - space dimensions using either uniformly or irregularly distributed point sets , or on dynamical test problems for which an analytical solution is known in advance , and therefore the results obtained are limited to idealized circumstances . as was emphasized by @xcite ,",
    "the lack of consistency associated with particle disorder and spatial adaptivity is not specific to a particular sph scheme but is rather a generic problem",
    ". it would therefore be desirable to test the present method for more complex models as those involving the solution of the equations of hydrodynamics coupled to gravity in three - space dimensions .",
    "to do so we choose as a problem the gravitational collapse and fragmentation of an initially rotating protostellar cloud , using a modified version of the gadget-2 code @xcite . as templates for the model clouds we use the `` standard isothermal test case '' in the variant calculated by @xcite and the centrally condensed , gaussian cloud model of @xcite coupled to a barotropic equation of state to mimic the nonisothermal collapse",
    "the simulations will then allow to better understand the impact of varying the number of neighbors as the resolution is increased on the sph discretization errors , which will naturally emerge from the density estimate itself and the sph momentum equation .",
    "the convergence and accuracy of the simulations is measured by evaluating how well the particle approximation of the integral consistency relations ( or moments of the kernel ) are satisfied during the evolution .    *",
    "a further implication of the consistency scaling relations on protostellar collapse calculations is the improved mass resolution .",
    "since the minimum resolvable mass , @xmath22 , scales with @xmath2 as @xmath23 , this implies that @xmath9 .",
    "although the collapse models proposed here start from ideal conditions , this aspect has an important impact on the outcome of the simulations , where well - defined , rotating circumstellar disks are seen to form around the growing fragments , which then increase in mass , develop spiral arms , and fragment to produce small - scale binary / multiple protostellar systems .",
    "this result is consistent with recent observations of l1448 irs3b @xcite : a close triple protostar system where two of the protostars formed by fragmentation of a massive disk with a spiral structure surrounding a primary , young star formed from the collapse of a larger cloud of gas and dust . while based principally on the relative proximity of the companion stars , this observation provides for the first time direct evidence of protostellar disk fragmentation as a mechanism for the formation of close binary / multiple young stars*.",
    "we start by recalling that the kernel ( or smoothed ) estimate of a scalar function @xmath24 , where @xmath25 may be either the density , @xmath26 , or the gas pressure , @xmath27 , is defined by @xmath28 where the volume integration is taken over the whole real space , @xmath29 denotes position , and @xmath30 is the kernel interpolation function , which must be positive definite , symmetric , monotonically decreasing , and satisfy the normalization condition @xmath31 together with the dirac-@xmath32 function property that is observed when @xmath4 . moreover",
    ", suitable kernels should have a compact support so that @xmath33 for @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is some integer that depends on the kernel function itself . making the change of variable @xmath36 , it is easy to show that the following scaling relation holds @xcite @xmath37 for any sph kernel function , where @xmath38 , 2 , and 3 in one- , two- , and three - space dimensions , respectively .",
    "if we expand in taylor series @xmath39 around @xmath40 , make @xmath41 and @xmath42 , use eq .",
    "( 3 ) , and insert the result in the kernel approximation ( 1 ) , we obtain for the function estimate the relation @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes the product of the @xmath45 operator with respect to coordinates @xmath46 @xmath47 times , @xmath48 is a tensor of rank @xmath47 , and the symbol `` @xmath49 '' is used to denote the @xmath47th - order inner product .",
    "therefore , if the kernel approximation is to exactly reproduce a sufficiently smooth function to @xmath50th order , the family of consistency relations must be fulfilled @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the null vector and @xmath53 is the zero tensor of rank @xmath47 .",
    "fulfillment of the integral relations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) guarantees @xmath12 consistency for the kernel estimate of the function , which by virtue of eq .",
    "( 4 ) reproduces exactly the continuous function to order @xmath11 . owing to the scaling relation ( 3 ) ,",
    "the contribution of the error due to the smoothing length can be separated from that due to the discrete representation of the integral , which , being independent of @xmath2 , will only depend on the number of neighbors within the kernel support and their spatial distribution .",
    "when solving the gravitohydrodynamics equations , gas compression is accounted for by evaluating the pressure gradient in the momentum equation .",
    "therefore , consistency relations for the kernel estimate of the gradient of a function are also of concern . using the definition of the kernel estimate of the gradient as @xmath54 expanding @xmath39 again in taylor series about @xmath40 , making @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and inserting the result in eq .",
    "( 7 ) we obtain the form @xmath55 where we have made use of the scaling relation @xmath56 with @xmath57 , which also holds for the gradient of the kernel . from eq .",
    "( 8) , it follows that @xmath12 consistency for the kernel estimate of the gradient is obtained only if the family of integral relations is exactly satisfied @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the unit tensor . the second equality in eq .",
    "( 10 ) holds for any volume enclosed by a continuous surface with differential volume element @xmath60 and differential surface element @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the outward unit normal from the volume surface .",
    "it is precisely the requirement that the zeroth moment @xmath63 , which determines that the surface integral of the kernel must vanish identically . because of the symmetry of the kernel function , relations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) with @xmath47 odd are automatically satisfied , while those with @xmath47 even will all appear in the expansion ( 4 ) as finite sources of error and will not vanish unless the kernel approaches the dirac-@xmath32 distribution",
    "hence , up to leading second - order eq .",
    "( 4 ) becomes @xmath64 which expresses that the kernel approximation of a function has @xmath8 consistency for an unbounded domain .",
    "( 1 ) it is a simple matter to show that the integral on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 13 ) , which corresponds to the second moment of the kernel @xmath65 , is equal to @xmath66 , implying that @xmath67 consistency is not achieved even though @xmath7 and @xmath8 consistencies are automatically satisfied @xcite .",
    "this term is just the variance of the particle position vector @xmath68 and is a measure of the spread of the particle positions relative to the mean .",
    "evidently , @xmath69 only when @xmath70 , or equivalently , when @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .    similarly , due to the symmetry of the kernel all integrals in eqs .",
    "( 10)-(12 ) will vanish identically for @xmath47 even , while only those for @xmath47 odd will survive in the series expansion ( 8) , which up to second - order becomes @xmath71 where the symbol `` @xmath72 '' is used to denote the triple inner product .",
    "note that the integral on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 14 ) is the third moment of the kernel gradient @xmath73 .",
    "we recall that relations ( 5 ) and ( 11 ) have important physical implications .",
    "in particular , satisfaction of relation ( 5 ) means that the homogeneity of space is not affected by the sph kernel approximation , which has as a consequence the conservation of linear momentum . on the other hand , fulfillment of relation ( 11 )",
    "expresses that the isotropy of space is preserved by the kernel approximation , and therefore angular momentum is locally conserved @xcite .",
    "an important feature of eqs .",
    "( 13 ) and ( 14 ) is that the contribution of @xmath2 to the error can be separated from the error carried by the discretization of the consistency relations , which will only depend on the number of neighbors , @xmath1 , and how they are distributed within the kernel support . in general , it is well - known that the particle approximation of eq .",
    "( 5 ) diverges from being exactly one , i.e. , @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 is the volume of the subdomain of neighbor particle @xmath77 .",
    "the error carried by eq .",
    "( 15 ) scales as @xmath17 , with @xmath78 $ ] , depending on the particle distribution @xcite .",
    "therefore , as the number of neighbors is increased the discrete normalization condition approaches unity and @xmath7 particle consistency is restored .",
    "this will also make the particle approximations of relations ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) to approach the null vector @xmath79 and the unit tensor , respectively .",
    "these conditions state that the particles should provide a good approximation to a partition of unity .",
    "as in traditional finite difference and finite element methods , the concept of consistency in sph defines how well the discrete model equations represent the exact equations in the continuum limit . in sph",
    "this is accomplished in two separate steps : the kernel approximation which , as we have described above , is derived from the continuous form , and the particle approximation , where the integrals are replaced by sums over a finite set of particles within the kernel support . since the kernel consistency relations do not assure consistency for the particle approximation , the discrete counterparts of eqs . ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) must be written as @xmath80 respectively , where quantities between parentheses denote exact values of the function and its derivatives at the position of particle @xmath81 and the particle representation of the consistency integrals is given by @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 , with @xmath85 and @xmath86 denoting the mass and density of particle @xmath77 , respectively . according to eqs .",
    "( 16 ) and ( 17 ) , @xmath7 particle consistency for the function and its gradient will demand that @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 at the position of particle @xmath81 , while @xmath8 particle consistency is restored if in addition @xmath90 and @xmath91 are satisfied .",
    "in particular , restoring @xmath7 particle consistency implies that the homogeneity and isotropy of the discrete space is preserved , which has as a consequence the conservation of linear and angular momentum in practical calculations @xcite .",
    "the goal here is to track the quality of the particle consistency relations in a true hydrodynamic evolution involving large density and pressure gradients as well as large spatial and temporal variations of the smoothing length .",
    "this will allow us to evaluate the degree of consistency that can be achieved when the number of neighbors within the kernel support and the smoothing length are allowed to vary with @xmath0 according to the scalings @xmath92 and @xmath93 , which approach asymptotically the joint limit @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 for particle consistency as @xmath0 is increased .",
    "a modified version of the simulation code gadget-2 is used for the calculations of this paper .",
    "the code relies on a fully conservative formulation where the discrete euler equations are derived via a variational principle from the discretized lagrangian of the fluid system @xcite . as in most sph formulations ,",
    "the density estimate is calculated by the summation interpolant @xmath94 while the euler - lagrange equations of motion for the particles are given by @xmath95,\\ ] ] where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the particle velocity and pressure , respectively , and the factor @xmath98 is defined by @xmath99 the velocity of particle @xmath81 is then updated according to @xmath100 where the last two terms on the right - hand side account for the self - gravitational acceleration and the artificial viscous forces , respectively .",
    "the gravitational forces are calculated using a hierarchical multipole expansion , which can be applied in the form of a treepm method , where short - range forces are calculated with the tree method and long - range forces are determined using mesh - based fourier methods . a detailed account of the code is given by @xcite .",
    "here we shall only briefly describe the improvements that have been incorporated in our version of the code .    one straightforward way of restoring particle consistency and therefore reducing the zeroth - order error terms carried by the sph representation of the continuity and momentum equations @xcite is just to increase the number of particles within the kernel support .",
    "however , conventional kernels , like the widely used cubic @xmath101-spline kernel of @xcite , suffer from a pairing instability when working with large numbers of neighbors , where particles come into close pairs and become less sensitive to small perturbations within the kernel support @xcite . to overcome this difficulty , we have adopted a wendland c@xmath102 kernel function @xcite @xmath103 if @xmath104 and @xmath105 otherwise , where @xmath106 . as was demonstrated by @xcite ,",
    "wendland functions have positive fourier transforms and so they can support arbitrarily large numbers of neighbors without favoring a close pairing of particles",
    ". moreover , the exact particle distribution depends on the dynamics of the flow and on the kernel function that is employed .",
    "this makes the accuracy assessment of sph a non - trivial problem .",
    "however , wendland functions are very reluctant to allow for particle motion on a sub - resolution scale and , in contrast to most commonly used kernels , they maintain a very regular particle distribution , even in highly dynamical tests @xcite .",
    "a further improvement includes the update of the artificial viscosity switch using the method proposed by @xcite . in this method the artificial viscosity term entering on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 25 ) is implemented as in gadget-2 by the common form @xcite @xmath107 where @xmath108/2 $ ] and @xmath109 and zero otherwise .",
    "here @xmath110 , @xmath111 is the signal speed , @xmath112 is the particle sound speed , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 .",
    "we note that in the original gadget-2 code formulation @xmath115 .",
    "it is well - known that this form of the artificial viscosity introduces excessive dissipation in shear flows , leading to spurious angular momentum transport in the presence of vorticity .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to suppress this excessive dissipation in regions where the vorticity dominates over the velocity divergence @xcite . in particular , @xcite proposed individual viscosity coefficients that adapt their values according to velocity - based source terms .",
    "later on , @xcite improved on this formulation by devising a novel shock indicator based on the total time derivative of the velocity divergence , which distinguishes shocks from purely convergent flows and discriminates between pre- and post - shocked regions .",
    "while this prevents false triggering of the artificial viscosity , their method includes a limiter which puts a stronger weight on the velocity divergence than on the vorticity .",
    "the artificial viscosity switch proposed by @xcite follows the same principles of that presented by @xcite , except that it now uses a limiter that applies the same weight to the velocity divergence and vorticity .",
    "the method consists of calculating the viscosity coefficient through the following steps .",
    "a target value of the viscosity coefficient is first calculated using the relation @xmath116 where @xmath117 and @xmath118 is the shock indicator .",
    "the total time derivative of the velocity divergence is given by @xmath119 after differentiation of the continuity equation and the divergence of the velocity is evaluated using the higher - order estimator proposed by @xcite .",
    "hence @xmath120 is indicative of nonlinear flow steepening as occur in pre - shocked regions , while in post - shocked regions @xmath121 . the true viscosity coefficient that enters in eq . ( 28 )",
    "is then defined by @xmath122\\hspace{0.5cm}{\\rm if}\\hspace{0.5 cm } \\alpha _ { a}>\\alpha _ { { \\rm tar},a } , \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath123 is a modified limiter given by @xmath124 is the time step , and @xmath125 is the decay time with a decay speed equal to @xmath126,\\ ] ] where @xmath127 .",
    "this method , which is referred to as an artificial viscosity with a strong limiter , suppresses viscous dissipation in subsonically convergent flows and ensures that @xmath128 rises rapidly up to @xmath129 when the converging flow becomes supersonic .",
    "this is a desirable property in protostellar collapse simulations where holding @xmath128 to a fixed constant value during the evolution may cause unphysical dissipation of local velocity differences away from shocks .",
    "such adverse effects of the artificial viscosity are responsible for the oversmoothing of weak shocks as well as the damping of adiabatic oscillations and shear flows , thereby seriously affecting the outcome of the simulations .",
    "we first test the quality of the first few moments in relations ( 18)-(21 ) for a static set of @xmath130 points distributed within a cube of length @xmath131 , density @xmath132 , pressure @xmath133 , and sound speed @xmath134 , with @xmath135 .",
    "two different particle distributions are considered : a glass - like configuration and a random distribution .",
    "a similar test problem was employed by @xcite to determine the quality of the discrete normalization condition given by relation ( 18 ) as the number of neighbors is increased from @xmath136 to 3200 . here",
    "the glass distribution was obtained from gadget-2 by enabling the corresponding code option and starting with * a random distribution * of sph particles and an expansion factor @xmath137 @xcite . the resulting outcome",
    "is then evolved hydrodynamically up to a time @xmath138 in code units , using an isothermal equation of state , periodic boundary conditions at the edges of the box , and excluding self - gravity .",
    "as the system evolves toward a relaxed state , the distributions of quantities , such as the smoothing length , the density , and the discrete moments given by relations ( 18)-(21 ) tend to normal distributions .",
    "the evolution ends up with an equilibrium configuration in which all particles have approximately equal sph densities ( @xmath139 ) .    * in real sph applications , the distances between neighboring particle pairs tend to equilibrate due to pressure forces , which makes the interpolation errors much smaller and the irregularity of the particle distribution more ordered than for a random distribution , where particles sample the fluid in a poissonian fashion . in this sense , a random configuration represents an extreme case for sph simulations .",
    "in contrast , a glass configuration mimics the other extreme case where the particle distribution is quasi - regular and almost force - free .",
    "although a random distribution rarely occurs in sph , except perhaps in highly turbulent flows where particles are highly disordered and sph is unable to re - order the particles , we analyze the quality of the density estimate and discrete moments of the kernel ( and kernel gradient ) for a random distribution with the only purpose of comparing with the results obtained by @xcite*.    the top and bottom panels of figure 1 show histograms of the particle density estimate [ eq . ( 22 ) ] with increasing @xmath1 from 48 to 3200 as in @xcite for the glass and random particle distributions , respectively .",
    "as expected , the density distribution for the glass configuration is much narrower than for the randomly distributed points . in the former case , as @xmath1 is increased the density distribution approaches a dirac-@xmath32 distribution , while in the latter case , the distribution slowly approaches a gaussian shape with a peak at @xmath132 .",
    "also , for small values of @xmath1 the density distribution shows long tails for the random configuration which are not present for the glass distribution , at least when @xmath140 .",
    "@xcite argued that such long tails are due to an overestimate of the density produced by the particle self - contribution in eq .",
    "( 22 ) when the sph particles are randomly spaced .",
    "* while this result is well - known , it can also be derived analytically from eq .",
    "( 22 ) given the mass of the particles , their number and actual distribution within the kernel volume , and the form of the kernel function*. * however , using the m@xmath141 kernel of @xcite , @xcite demonstrated that the overestimate in density occurs because a random distribution produces a fluctuating density field , where the particle positions are correlated with the overdense fluctuations and anticorrelated with the underdense fluctuations . in other words , the expectation value of the density at the location of a particle will be overestimated by a value almost exactly equal to the `` self - density '' .",
    "this is the reason why it seems appropriate to exclude the particle self - contribution from eq .",
    "@xcite concluded that as soon as the particle positions are settled before they are allowed to evolve dynamically , exclusion of the self - contribution will lead to a significant error because the particle distribution will cease to be random and the density fluctuations will be removed*. table 1 lists the standard deviation , @xmath142 , and expectation value , @xmath143 , of the density measured from the distributions of figure 1 .",
    "for both particle configurations , @xmath142 decreases with increasing @xmath1 , while the value of @xmath143 becomes close to unity when @xmath144 for a glass configuration and @xmath145 for a random distribution .",
    "this agrees with the @xmath146 and @xmath147 trends of @xmath142 as a function of @xmath1 found by @xcite for a truly random and a glass - like configuration , respectively .",
    "since the results of figure 1 are consistent with the findings of @xcite for these tests , we feel confident to proceed with a similar statistical analysis to measure the quality of the discrete moments as @xmath1 is increased .",
    "according to the series expansions ( 16 ) and ( 17 ) , the error in the density and density gradient estimates separates into two contributions : one due to the local value of @xmath2 and the other due to the discrete values of the moments .",
    "since the latter are independent of @xmath2 , they will only depend on the number of neighbors within the kernel support .",
    "this observation introduces a subtle difference between the meaning of consistency and accuracy in sph .",
    "consistency demands that @xmath5 , while accuracy demands that @xmath5 and @xmath4 in order to have convergent results in the limit @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , we can achieve approximate particle consistency and improved accuracy as @xmath1 is increased and @xmath2 is decreased with @xmath0 .    to achieve @xmath7 consistency , the parameter @xmath148 and",
    "the mean of the elements of matrix @xmath149 should peak around 1 , while the mean of the components of vector @xmath150 should follow a peaked distribution around 0 .",
    "moreover , @xmath8 consistency will additionally require that the mean of the components of @xmath151 and the mean of the elements of matrix @xmath152 both peak around 0 .",
    "the distributions of all these quantities are plotted in figures 2 and 3 for the glass and random configurations , respectively .",
    "we may see that for the glass configuration the distributions follow the desired behavior and approach a dirac-@xmath32 function as @xmath1 is increased , indicating that approximate @xmath8 consistency is achieved for the density and its gradient when @xmath153 .",
    "conversely , for a random configuration the distributions approach gaussian - like shapes with peaks close to the continuum values . for both particle configurations the distributions of @xmath148 peak at values lower than 1 for small @xmath1 , suggesting an overestimation of the particle density for small numbers of neighbors .",
    "table 1 lists the standard deviations and expectation values of these moments as calculated by fitting a gaussian function to the histograms of figures 2 and 3 . from these values",
    "we see that very good @xmath7 and @xmath8 consistencies are achieved for the glass configuration . a stronger sensitivity to the particle distribution",
    "is observed for @xmath150 , which is exacerbated for the random configuration . in this case , the standard deviation of the distribution is consistently larger for smaller @xmath1 and converges to zero rather slowly compared to the glass configuration .",
    "evidently , @xmath150 seems to be more sensitive to the degree of particle disorder than the other parameters for this test , implying a higher error in the sph representation of the gradient .",
    "although this error depends on the quality of the particle distribution , it can be regulated by further increasing the number of neighbors since the standard deviation is expected to follow a trend between @xmath154 and @xmath147 in actual sph calculations .",
    "also , note that the expectation values of @xmath151 , @xmath150 , and @xmath152 are always zero because of the symmetry of the kernel .",
    "the required computational cost in cpu time for a complete run is nearly the same for the standard and modified gadget-2 code .",
    "however , the computational cost increases almost linearly with @xmath1 for fixed @xmath0 .",
    "for instance , a run with @xmath153 took about 11 s compared to @xmath155 s for @xmath156 , implying a factor of @xmath157 more cpu time .",
    "thus , increasing the number of neighbors increases the computational cost , which is the price that has to be paid when sph is used as a numerically consistent method .",
    "also , @xcite argued that when @xmath1 is made to vary with @xmath0 as @xmath158 , the computational cost scales with @xmath0 as @xmath159 rather than as @xmath160 as for traditional choices of @xmath1 .      we now test the performance of our implemented artificial viscosity for an equilibrium ring of isothermal gas rotating about a central point mass .",
    "this test is the same documented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "self - gravity of the ring is neglected and perfect balance between pressure forces , gravitational attraction from the central point mass , and centrifugal forces is assumed .",
    "the surface density of the gas is given by the gaussian profile @xmath161,\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the mass of the ring , @xmath162 is the radial distance from the central point mass ( @xmath163 ) , @xmath164 , and @xmath165 is the width of the ring .",
    "for the central point mass we set @xmath166 , where @xmath167 is the gravitational constant and @xmath168 .",
    "the ring is filled with @xmath169 particles , initially distributed using the method of @xcite . with these parameters ,",

    "in contrast , models g1w ",
    "g6w all meet the jeans resolution requirements for gravitational fragmentation .",
    "however , in order to avoid spurious fragmentation the gravity softening length of each particle , @xmath223 , is evolved with time in step with its corresponding smoothing length @xmath224 so that @xmath225 @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite showed that sph reproduces the analytical jeans criterion and simulates gravitational fragmentation properly , even at very poor resolution .",
    "that is , artificial fragmentation is suppressed in regions where the jeans mass is less than the minimum resolvable mass , @xmath226 , provided the standard kernel - softened gravity ( @xmath227 ) is used , where @xmath10 is the mass of a single sph particle .",
    "this way unresolved jeans - unstable condensations are stabilized numerically . thus , @xcite concluded that failing to satisfy the jeans condition simply suppresses true fragmentation in sph calculations , rather than resulting in artificial fragmentation as in finite - difference codes .",
    "similar conclusions were previously met by @xcite through an analytical derivation of the jeans criterion .",
    "although a uniform - density profile is an extreme idealization of a real cloud core , it provides a simple model to learn how nonaxisymmetric perturbations grow from a structureless medium .",
    "perhaps the most illustrative example of this is given by the standard isothermal test case , which was originally proposed by @xcite and thereafter used as a benchmark for testing numerical codes studying protostellar collapse and fragmentation processes , with the fairly good agreement that the outcome of the first evolution is the formation of a protostellar binary system @xcite .",
    "previous highly - resolved sph calculations for this test over @xmath228 orders of magnitude increase in density and using a limited number of neighbors ( @xmath229 ) have predicted the formation of two elongated fragments connected by a filamentary bar when the maximum density in the fragments has passed @xmath211 g @xmath187 @xcite .",
    "when the gas within the fragments becomes adiabatic and heats up , their cylindrical collapse slows down .",

    "however , comparisons between all these earlier calculations have been performed with varied total numbers of particles @xmath0 and a constant number of neighbors @xmath229 or so , and therefore they are likely to suffer from a loss of consistency due to persisting zeroth - order discretization errors , whose magnitudes may even grow at a faster rate when approaching the limit @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xcite .    figure 6 displays column density images of the cloud midplane during the collapse of model u4c using the original gadget-2 formulation with @xmath156 neighbors .",
    "we may see that up to @xmath230 ( peak density of @xmath231 ) , the morphology of collapse and the fragmentation details are very similar to previously reported sph results for this model .",
    "a singular bar connecting two quasi - spherical fragments is formed and the details of the fanning - out of the bar close to the binary fragments are also reproduced . however ,",
    "when the calculation is continued farther in time the binary components undergo rapid rotational disruption into smaller fragments ( see the last snapshot at @xmath232 when the peak density is @xmath233 )",
    ". meanwhile the gas within the singular bar becomes adiabatic , hindering its cylindrical collapse and fragmenting along its length into similar small objects . due to their excess kinetic energy acquired during rotational disruption of the former binary components , some of these fragments",
    "collide and merge between them and/or with those coming from the bar breakup , followed by a rather chaotic dynamics at later times . at these stages , the outcomes of models u1c",
    " u4c show no sign of convergence at comparable maximum densities .",
    "* however , we note that the lack of convergence is not surprising because at this stage the small - scale fragmentation observed derives from the non - linear amplification of particle noise inherent in sph , which leads to different patterns as the spatial resolution is increased .",
    "this noise arises because mutually repulsive pressure forces between particle pairs do not cancel in all directions simultaneously .",
    "it affects the accuracy of sph and leads to slow convergence rates . on the other hand , the use of the standard artifical viscosity with a constant coefficient leads to spurious angular momentum transport in the presence of vorticity , which may cause the rotational disruption of the binary fragments*.    the time evolution of the distribution of the first few moments given by relations ( 18)(21 ) is depicted in figure 7 for model u4c . only the late stages of collapse during the process of fragmentation",
    "are shown .",
    "all plots represent only particles carrying a density greater than @xmath234 as identified from the last snapshot generated during the simulation . starting from a given point in the evolution , *",
    "histograms * for the particle density , smoothing length , and moment distributions are constructed .",
    "the gray strips in the plots of figure 7 correspond to the time evolution of the standard deviations calculated with respect to the maximum of the distributions ( marked with the solid lines ) , where most particles lie .",
    "hence , the width of the strips at any given time gives the width of the corresponding distribution .",
    "this procedure allows us to evaluate the quality of the consistency relations in rapidly evolving regions of high density where the smoothing length is also varying rapidly to guarantee adequate spatial resolution . according to expansions ( 16 ) and ( 17 ) , the trends of the @xmath235 , @xmath236 , and @xmath237 distributions are indicative of whether @xmath7 consistency is achieved during the evolution , while the degree of @xmath8 consistency is measured by the time evolution of the @xmath238 and @xmath239 distributions .",
    "the maxima of the distributions of @xmath238 and @xmath239 always peak at zero because of the symmetry of the kernel .",
    "the maxima of the @xmath236 distribution also peak at zero , except toward the end of the evolution when they start to oscillate erratically about a mean value close to zero . as the smoothing length decreases sharply , within the growing fragments , the width of @xmath238 and @xmath239 contracts until approaching a dirac-@xmath32 distribution .",
    "in contrast , the width of @xmath236 remains approximately constant . on the other hand , the peaks of the distributions of @xmath235 and @xmath237 are always below unity , meaning that @xmath7 consistency is not achieved .",
    "the deviations from unity of @xmath235 are even larger than those of @xmath237 , implying that the estimate of the function is more sensitive to the particle discretization errors than the estimate of the gradient .",
    "violation of the normalization condition by the particle approximation means that the calculation of model u4c is even * worse * than first - order accurate .",
    "similar temporal variations of the estimates of the moments were also observed for models u1c  u3c at lower resolution .",
    "for all these models , the values of @xmath235 and @xmath237 , which were initially closer to unity , degraded gradually in the course of collapse and the time interval represented in figure 7 corresponds to that of maximum deviation .",
    "details of the evolution of models u2w and u4w are shown in figures 8 and 9 , respectively , at comparable maximum densities .",
    "as shown in table 2 , model u2w is run with @xmath240 and @xmath241 , while model u4w uses @xmath242 and @xmath243 , where the initial value of @xmath2 is set by the relation @xmath220 ( see fig .",
    "5 ) . except for small residual differences in the evolution of the maximum density at earlier collapse times , models u2w and u4w shows essentially the same morphology .",
    "the same is true for models u1w and u3w .",
    "it is important to notice that increasing @xmath1 with resolution implies reducing the particle discretization errors * and improving the mass resolution as @xmath244*. in other words , this means that the particle approximation approaches the kernel approximation .",
    "since models u1c  u4c work with smaller smoothing lengths due to their fixed , low value of @xmath1 compared to models u1w ",
    "u4w for the same @xmath0 , it is not possible to establish a direct quantitative comparison between both sequences .",
    "indeed this will require recalculating models u1w  u4w with huge amounts of neighbors so that both sequences will have the same value of @xmath2 but different @xmath0 .",
    "however , working with finer values of @xmath2 , while losing complete consistency , does not imply higher accuracy and convergence .",
    "if @xmath7 and @xmath8 consistencies are achieved , it follows that the discrete expansions ( 16 ) and ( 17 ) tend to their continuous counterparts ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) , respectively , implying second - order accuracy for the particle approximation independently of the numerical value of @xmath2 .",
    "this is the essence of particle consistency in sph .",
    "the early collapse is qualitatively similar to models u1c",
    " u4c . initially the cloud flattens about the equatorial plane , producing an isothermal disk with strong shocks on both sides of it .",
    "the azimuthal structure of the disk consists of two overdense blobs as a result of the @xmath245 perturbation seed , which then fall toward the cloud center to merge into a bar with maximum density at its endpoints . due to converging flow into the bar",
    ", it soon grows in mass and undergoes a cylindrical collapse upon itself .",
    "the result of this process is the formation of a binary connected by a considerably more massive and thicker bar compared to models u1c",
    " u4c . the basic features of the formation of the binary plus connecting bar are very similar in figures 8 and 9 despite the difference in spatial resolution . in these models",
    "the bar is centrally condensed , a feature which is not clear from models u1c  u4c . the bar as a whole is never seen to contract into a singular filament .",
    "the nascent binary cores are spinning about an axis of symmetry passing through their points of maximum density .",
    "this causes the bar to fan out close to the fragments and develop well - pronounced spiral arms . as the cores accrete low angular momentum from the connecting bar and the spiral arms , the binary separation decreases and the bar eventually dissipates . because of its higher initial resolution , model u4w fragments into a wider binary ( @xmath246 ) compared to model u2w ( @xmath247 ) . as a result of the accretion process",
    ", well - defined protostellar disks form around the cores .",
    "the size of these disks is of order @xmath248 au .",
    "we note that the outcome of model u2w is very similar to that reported by @xcite for the same initial conditions using their amr finite - difference method .",
    "the last snapshot of figure 8 shows the binary at an orbital separation of @xmath249 au , when almost 10% of the cloud mass is cointained by the fragments .",
    "a similar binary system is produced by models u3w and u4w but with larger orbital separations ( @xmath250 au ) compared to model u2w at approximately the same maximum density .",
    "however , in model u4w the circumstellar disk of one of the binary cores is seen to fragment into a secondary of mass @xmath251 , which then revolves around the primary with mean orbital separations of @xmath2521420 au .",
    "the last snapshot of figure 9 shows the final configuration for model u4w , where a new small fragment ( @xmath253 ) has emerged from the residual bar material , which moves toward the binary core on the right side and so it will probably merge .",
    "the calculation was terminated at this time because of the increasingly small time steps at this stage of the evolution . about 9% of the total cloud mass",
    "is contained by the cores in models u3w and u4w .",
    "the formation of an apparently stable triple system in the highest resolved calculation shows that the standard isothermal test is a demanding one .",
    "fragment disruption is never seen to occur and very good convergence is achieved .",
    "this is a big difference with models",
    "u1c  u4c , where the cores disrupted into smaller fragments and the connecting bar experienced multiple fragmentation along its length into similar small fragments .",
    "* the use of a wendland function with a large number of neighbors provides sufficient sampling of the kernel volumes and reduces particle noise compared to the case of models u1c  u4c .",
    "therefore , fragmentation of the protostellar disk leading to a close binary in model u4w is not the result of noise amplification but rather of the nonlinear growth of a gravitational instability as the mass resolution is improved ( see section 5.4 below)*. the effects of increasing the number of neighbors from @xmath254 to 200 , while keeping @xmath0 fixed were previously studied by @xcite for initially uniform clouds starting with stronger thermal support ( @xmath255 ) and lower rotation ( @xmath256 ) than the models considered here .",
    "they found that increasing the ratio @xmath257 speeds up fragmentation because increasing @xmath1 for a fixed @xmath0 decreases the spatial resolution as @xmath2 necessarily increases .",
    "we note that this strategy is different from the one implemented here where full sph consistency demands that @xmath6 and @xmath4 in the limit @xmath3 and @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the impact of varying the initial temperature on the collapse of the standard isothermal test case was recently studied by @xcite using their gradsph code .",
    "in particular , when the temperature is set to @xmath190 k they obtain a stable binary system in a similar way as shown in figure 8 for model u2w",
    ". however , their calculations differ from ours in the value of @xmath234 . *",
    "if @xmath234 is two orders of magnitude higher , this surely lengthens the isothermal phase of collapse and favors * the formation of a stable binary system ( see , for instance , @xcite for similar calculations with the standard gadget-2 code ; their figures 5 and 6 ) .",
    "the effects of the magnetic field on a variant of the standard isothermal test case have been investigated by @xcite using the development version of gadget-3 extended to include the magnetic field . setting @xmath258 g @xmath187",
    ", they also obtained a stable binary system as in @xcite and @xcite for a purely hydrodynamical calculation with no magnetic field .",
    "figures 10 and 11 show the time evolution of the estimates of the moments for models u2w and u4w . compared to figure 7 , the moments @xmath235 and @xmath237 are now closer to unity for most of the evolution , implying that approximate @xmath7 consistency is achieved in this set of calculations , except after @xmath259 when the degree of @xmath7 consistency is temporally lost within the fragment regions ( see fig . 10 for model u2w ) .",
    "this occurs precisely when @xmath2 changes rapidly to ensure sufficient spatial resolution within the higher - density regions . after this adaptive process , i.e. ,",
    "when the variations of @xmath2 slow down , @xmath7 consistency is rapidly restored ( after about @xmath260 for model u2w and @xmath261 for model u4w ) .",
    "this is not surprising since it is well - known that adaptive sph calculations severely affect the consistency of the method @xcite .",
    "however , this temporal loss of consistency can be cured by increasing further both @xmath1 and @xmath0 such that the ratio @xmath6 .",
    "this can be seen by comparing figures 10 and 11 , where the interval of inconsistency is reduced and the quality of the estimates improves for model u4w .",
    "if we take the temporal mean of the maximum of the distributions of @xmath235 and @xmath237 over the full interval , the result is very close to unity , implying that @xmath7 consistency is maintained on average .",
    "this is not the case for models u1c  u4c . the maximum of the distributions for the other moments in figures 10 and 11 are seen to exhibit erratic oscillations about a mean value close to zero",
    ". however , the amplitudes of the oscillations are much smaller for model u4w than for model u2w , implying that approximate @xmath8 consistency is better achieved by the former model . therefore , we may conclude that model u4w is actually closer to second - order accuracy * and exhibits less noise than its counterpart models at lower resolution*.      calculations of the protostellar collapse starting from centrally condensed , gaussian density variations are of greater interest to understand the process of binary fragmentation . a sequence of models similar to g1c  g6c with increasing spatial resolution and fixed @xmath262 was previously calculated by @xcite using the standard gadget-2 code ( their models g1b ",
    "as the resolution was progressively increased from @xmath263 to 10 million particles , they obtained apparent convergence to a binary system . in order to separate the effects of the artificial viscosity from those of improved consistency on fragmentation",

    "although the outcome is the same for all models , the details of the final patterns and properties of the fragments are not the same implying a lack of convergence which can be associated with a loss of @xmath7 consistency as revealed by the time evolution of the distributions of the estimates of @xmath235 and @xmath237 . as was outlined before",
    ", the form of the artificial viscosity affects the outcome of the simulations .",
    "unphysical dissipation of local velocity gradients away from shocks in the calculations of @xcite is likely to be the cause of the differences with the outcomes of sequence g1c  g6c .",
    "we now describe the results of models g1w  g6w , which were run using the modified gadget-2 code with increasing number of neighbors .",
    "the initial phase of collapse for these models is qualitatively similar to that observed for models",

    "that is , up to the point where @xmath265 , the cloud evolves to a centrally condensed , flat disk .",
    "when the disk becomes adiabatic , it expands due to increasing pressure forces and deforms by rotational effects into a central bar .",

    "it is evident from the first and second column of images that fragmentation is anticipated when the resolution is increased .",
    "however , from the last column we may see that reasonably good convergence is achieved by the highly resolved calculations at comparable maximum densities and times . by @xmath267 ,",
    "the fragments are well - defined and evolving as separate entities from the parent cloud .",
    "they contain about 13.2% ( g3w ) , 8.4% ( g4w ) , 8.5% ( g5w ) , and 8.5% ( g6w ) of the total cloud mass , while the separations of the two satellite fragments from the central core are ( @xmath268 au ) for g3w , ( @xmath269 au ) for g4w , ( @xmath270 au ) for g5w , and ( 288 au ) for g6w .",

    "it is more difficult to attain convergence for low than for high thermal support .",
    "the point is that in the case of low thermal support the dynamics of the flow is likely to become highly nonlinear faster than in clouds with high thermal support .",
    "the same is also true for models where the isothermal phase of collapse is prolonged by choosing high values of the critical density , as is indeed the case of models u1w",

    "the radius of the disk is @xmath280 au and grows to @xmath281 au by @xmath282 just before fragmentation . according to the toomre stability criterion , the disk is unstable to axisymmetric perturbations if @xmath283 where @xmath284 is the mass of the central protostar , @xmath285 is the disk scale height , and @xmath162 denotes radial distance from the central protostar . in the above definition",
    "we have assumed that the disk is keplerian and define @xmath286 , where @xmath287 is the keplerian angular velocity at radius @xmath162 .",
    "taking @xmath288 au , which is the approximate radius where fragmentation of the disk occurs , we find that @xmath289 and the toomre parameter @xmath290 .",
    "soon thereafter , the gravitational instability enters a nonlinear growth phase and the outermost part of one of the arms condenses into a secondary at a distance of @xmath291 au from the primary , leading to fragmentation of the disk into a tight binary .",
    "the newly formed fragment takes its orbital angular momentum from the rotation of the disk and revolves around the primary in an approximate circular orbit . by @xmath292 , when the calculation is terminated , the primary has a mass of @xmath293 @xmath278 , while the mass of the secondary is @xmath294 @xmath278 . *",
    "the calculation of model u4w shows that working with 12289 neighbors is enough to resolve small - scale fragmentation due to the gravitational instability of a massive protostellar disk .",
    "while this can be seen as a possible mechanism for the formation of binary / multiple stellar systems separated by a few au , recent observations of the l1448 irs3b triple system , consisting of two protostars at the center and a third one distant from them , are providing strong support to this conclusion @xcite . the observations , which were conducted with the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) , show that the spiral structure in the dusty disk surrounding the young stars is indicative of their having been formed by fragmentation of the disk via a gravitational instability .",
    "hence , differences in distance may be the result of different formation mechanisms .",
    "for instance , systems separated by hundreds to thousands au are likely to be the result of fragmentation of the larger cloud during its early gravitational collapse , while tighter systems with separations of tens of au may be hierarchical systems formed from disk fragmentation .    similarly , as shown in fig .",
    "12 , models g1w - g6w collapsed to form a central protostar surrounded by a circumstellar disk , which then experienced fragmentation into two secondaries , forming a tertiary protostellar system .",
    "this time the circumstellar disk appears to be larger ( @xmath295 au ) at the time of fragmentation compared to model u4w because of thermal retardation due to the assumption of a lower value of the critical density ( @xmath296 g @xmath187 ) for the gaussian models . as the ternary fragments grow in density , each of them develop well - pronounced circumstellar disks as shown by the last column of density maps in fig .",

    "g4w - g6w    .",
    "we have investigated the consistency of smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) in numerical simulation tests of the collapse and fragmentation of rotating molecular cloud cores .",
    "a modified version of the simulation code gadget-2 @xcite was used for the calculations , where the interpolation kernel was replaced by a wendland c@xmath102 function to allow support of large numbers of neighbors and an advanced scheme for the artificial viscosity was implemented based on the method proposed by @xcite .",
    "approximations to the power - law relations provided by @xcite were used to set the kernel interpolation parameters , namely the total number of particles @xmath0 , the smoothing length @xmath2 , and the number of neighbors @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is allowed to vary with @xmath0 as @xmath93 . with this choice , the scalings @xmath220 and",
    "@xmath219 were used to set the initial values of @xmath2 and @xmath1 for fixed @xmath0 . as the domain resolution is increased ,",
    "these scalings comply with the combined limit @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 with @xmath6 for full sph consistency @xcite .",
    "the initial conditions for the protostellar collapse models were chosen to be the `` standard isothermal test case '' in the variant calculated by @xcite and the centrally condensed , gaussian cloud advanced by @xcite , coupled to a barotropic pressure - density relation to simulate the transition from the isothermal to the nonisothermal collapse .",
    "the critical density , separating both regimes , was set to @xmath211 g @xmath187 for the standard isothermal test to provide insight into the role played by @xmath1 for a case where convergence is more demanding at late stages of the evolution .",
    "in contrast , for the gaussian cloud model @xmath218 g @xmath187 , which is more representative of the near - isothermal phase @xcite .",
    "since convergence is easier when shortening the isothermal phase of collapse due to thermal retardation , this model has been used to discern the effects of the artificial viscosity on the final outcome by comparing with previous calculations by @xcite .",
    "two separate sequences of calculations with increasing @xmath0 were run for both models .",
    "one sequence used the standard version of gadget-2 with fixed @xmath297 , while the other sequence was calculated using the modified version of the code with varied @xmath1 . over @xmath228 orders of magnitude increase in density , the standard isothermal models with fixed @xmath1 produced a binary connected by a singular bar in much the same way as reported in previous sph calculations . however , as the evolution was continued farther in time the binary cores and the bar were seen to fragment into smaller condensations , with the dynamics becoming highly nonlinear and chaotic due to numerical noise amplification . at these stages ,",
    "even the highly resolved models showed no sign of convergence .",
    "in contrast , the models with varied @xmath1 experienced a similar initial collapse , producing stable binary systems for moderate resolutions ( @xmath298 ) and a triple system for @xmath242 due to fragmentation of the disk around one of the binary components into a secondary .",
    "* owing to the higher number of neighbors and hence improved mass resolution for this model , it was possible to resolve the small - scale structure and fragmentation of the disk into a close binary . this mechanism has recently received convincing observational evidence for explaining the formation of close binary / multiple protostellar systems @xcite*. on the other hand , the gaussian clouds using the standard gadget-2 code with fixed @xmath1 but with the new scheme of the artificial viscosity produced different outcomes at all resolutions compared to those previously reported by @xcite . in all cases , only qualitative convergence into a triple system was achieved , consisting of a bound binary plus a third core at much higher orbital distances .",
    "evidently , the reduced dissipation and better treatment of shocks implied by the new artificial viscosity had an important impact on the final outcome . with the modified code , all runs also produced a final triple system but with a quite different pattern . in this case , the highly resolved runs were seen to converge at comparable maximum densities and times .",
    "the degree of consistency of the calculations was measured by tracking how well the kernel consistency relations were reproduced by the particle approximation . from the time evolution of the estimates of the moments of the kernel",
    "it was clear that all calculations with fixed @xmath297 were inconsistent .",
    "the normalization condition of the kernel and the first moment of the gradient always diverged from unity , with the maximum deviations occurring at the late stages of the evolution just after the fragmentation period when the fragments were growing in density and @xmath2 was varying rapidly to ensure adequate spatial resolution , meaning that @xmath7 consistency was not achieved by these models .",
    "thus , violation of the normalization condition by the particle approximation implies that these calculations are even * worse * than first - order accurate due to persisting zeroth - order discretization errors @xcite .",
    "in contrast , approximate @xmath7 and @xmath8 consistencies were achieved by all models when @xmath1 was allowed to vary with @xmath0 .",
    "however , loss of @xmath7 consistency was temporally observed within the fragment regions due to rapid variations of @xmath2 there , confirming previous expectations that adaptive kernels severely affect the consistency of sph @xcite .",
    "after this adaptive process , the variations of @xmath2 in the high - density regions slowed down and @xmath7 consistency was rapidly restored by the models . in both sequences of calculations , as @xmath1 and @xmath0 are increased the interval and degree of inconsistency are progressively reduced and the quality of the calculations is improved . on the other hand ,",
    "the temporal means of the estimates of the normalization condition of the kernel and the first moment of the gradient over the full interval , where consistency is lost and then restored , are seen to peak very close to unity , implying that @xmath7 consistency is achieved on average within the fragment regions .",
    "since the estimates of the second moments are always close to zero , approximate @xmath8 consistency is also achieved .",
    "we may therefore conclude that the simulations presented here are actually close to second - order accuracy .    as a final remark",
    ", it has been demonstrated that @xmath7 particle consistency for both the estimates of a function and its gradient implies preservation of the homogeneity and isotropy of the discrete space , which have as consequences conservation of the linear and angular momentum , respectively @xcite .",
    "therefore , we may expect that local linear and angular momentum are well conserved in our consistent collapse calculations .",
    "however , it would be interesting to quantify numerically the degree of angular momentum conservation when @xmath7 consistency is achieved in the limit @xmath6 . due to its lagrangian character ,",
    "sph provides direct access to the initial angular momentum of particles so that any loss can be easily quantified following a similar analysis to that developed by @xcite .",
    "future studies in this line will deal with the impact of consistency on angular momentum conservation and how to address the jeans - resolution requirement under large numbers of neighbors .",
