    "similarly , the color - flavor - locked phases  @xcite , which can exist ( at least theoretically ) at asymptotically large baryon densities may be found in neutrons stars and also possibly in magnetars , where the magnetic fields are to the order of @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the quark - gluon plasma of the early universe may have sustained large magnetic fields . as such",
    "there is a lot of interest in the properties of qcd vacuum and other qcd phases in the presence of strong magnetic fields .",
    "qcd in a strong magnetic field is a topic of great contemporary interest and has been studied in the schwinger limit quite extensively  @xcite . in this limit , the quantity @xmath4 is held fixed ( with @xmath5 being a relevant electromagnetic charge and @xmath6 being the external field ) while @xmath7 as @xmath8 .",
    "this limit was first considered in the context of vacuum pair production in qed by schwinger  @xcite but since has been used to study the low - energy qcd vacuum in the context of chiral perturbation theory , primarily for mesons . for instance , the chiral condensate of the low - energy qcd vacuum has been studied through chiral perturbation theory using the schwinger limit for zero and non - zero pion masses up to next - to - leading order and the result has been generalized to the finite temperature case  @xcite . at large magnetic fields , qcd undergoes dimensional reduction and quarks acquire masses of @xmath9 , where @xmath5 is the quark electromagnetic charge and @xmath6 the external field .",
    "this explains the origin of magnetic catalysis due to the ",
    "cooper effect \" , which means that pairing is more effective in one spatial dimension compared to three  @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been interest in finite isospin qcd , where the qcd vacuum has been shown to exhibit superconducting behavior through the condensation of charged pions  @xcite .",
    "this has been shown in the context of chiral perturbation theory and lattice qcd , even though the lattice seems to have a sign problem in the presence of both an isospin chemical potential and a magnetic field due to the charge difference between the up and down quarks .    the study of ref .",
    "@xcite was performed in chiral perturbation theory at finite isospin chemical potentials and a uniform magnetic field , with the charged pions coupled to dynamical photons .",
    "it was shown that for realistic pion masses , the system behaves as a type - ii superconductor , with a uniform superconducting phase at low magnetic fields and a phase transition to a normal phase with increasing magnetic fields through an intermediate phase of topological vortices  @xcite .",
    "the study was performed at leading order in chiral perturbation theory and is valid as long as the relevant physical parameters including the pion mass ( @xmath10 ) , the isospin chemical potential ( @xmath11 ) and the magnetic field ( @xmath6 ) satisfy the condition that @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the typical hadronic scale which of the order @xmath14 , with @xmath15 being the pion decay constant .    in this paper , we consider chiral perturbation in a background magnetic field in the schwinger limit .",
    "in particular , this means that the charged pions are coupled to the classical external magnetic fields at all orders .",
    "however , unlike the study of ref  @xcite , we will assume that there are no dynamical photons that can couple to the charged pions .",
    "it is well - understood that superconductivity arises due to spontaneous symmetry breaking , whereby photons acquire mass . from the perspective of the relevant lagrangian",
    ", a term proportional to @xmath16 is introduced - it becomes impossibly expensive to sustain a magnetic field .",
    "obviously , in the absence of photons and hence a back - reaction from the photons to a strong , external magnetic field , ( i.e. the schwinger limit ) , it is natural to ask what possible phases _ can _ be sustained in finite isospin chiral perturbation theory",
    ". we will show in this paper that unlike the result of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the charged pions condensed , that in the schwinger limit ( with no photons ) , that charged pion condensation is forbidden and that only the neutral pions can condense .",
    "we will also consider a particular example of the pion condensed phase , namely @xmath1 domain walls that was first considered in ref .",
    "it was shown that this phase becomes more stable than the normal phase of chiral perturbation theory above a critical magnetic field .",
    "we will show a new phase transition line emerges in finite isospin chiral perturbation theory if the system is above the critical baryon chemical potential of ref .",
    "@xcite assuming that the @xmath1 domain wall is the lowest energy pion condensed phase that can exist .",
    "it is important to note that this assumption while plausible is strictly speaking unproven ; the plausibility is motivated by the absence of other possible neutral pion phases that satisfy the equations of motion of finite isospin chiral perturbation theory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the first section , we summarize the chiral perturbation theory lagrangian at finite isospin and a uniform magnetic field using the same notation as in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the following section",
    ", we will prove a no - go theorem that charged pions can not condense in the schwinger limit ( with no back - reacting photon fields ) .",
    "the result seems plausible based on the fact that the mechanism that gives rise to photon masses through symmetry breaking ( either spontaneous or explicit ) is absent in the schwinger limit . in the third section",
    ", we will consider how the existence of a @xmath1 domain state modifies the finite isospin low - energy qcd phase diagram in a magnetic field above the critical baryon chemical potential of ref .",
    "in particular we will show a new phase transition from the normal state to a @xmath1 domain wall state , which is different from the result of ref .",
    "@xcite but reduces to the result of ref .",
    "@xcite at zero isospin chemical potential .",
    "we begin with the leading order chiral perturbation theory lagrangian at finite isospin and a magnetic field .",
    "the lagrangian at finite isospin ( but zero external magnetic field ) was first considered in refs .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that for isospin chemical potentials greater than or equal to the pion mass , a superfluid phase of condensed , charged pions becomes energetically favorable .",
    "it was shown that the charged superfluid in the presence of an external magnetic field with the pions coupled to back - reacting photons exhibit type - ii superconductivity in ref .",
    "the lagrangian is as follows : @xmath17 where @xmath15 is the pion decay constant @xmath10 is the pion mass and @xmath18 are the @xmath19 matrices , which we parametrize as in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath20 where the @xmath21 and @xmath22 fields are defined as : @xmath23 note that this parametrization guarantees that @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",

    "it is defined as follows : @xmath26-iea_{\\mu}[q,\\ \\sigma]\\ , \\ ] ] where isospin enters as a spatially - independent zeroth component of the gauge field , while the magnetic field enters through only the spatial components .",
    "note that @xmath27 is the charge of a positive pion and the charge matrix for the up and down quarks is defined through the following relation : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a @xmath30 identity matrix and @xmath31 is the third pauli matrix . since the charge matrix @xmath32 enters the lagrangian through a commutator with the pion fields @xmath18 , only the component of charge in the @xmath31 direction affects the lagrangian .",
    "we use the parametrization for @xmath18 defined in eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) and couple the lagrangian to the external magnetic field , which we will assume is uniform in space . in doing so , the effective lagrangian of low - energy qcd at lowest order in chiral perturbation theory becomes :    @xmath33\\\\&+m_{\\pi}^{2}f_{\\pi}^{2}(\\cos\\theta\\cos\\psi-1)+\\frac{\\mu_{i}^{2}f_{\\pi}^{2}}{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta\\cos^{2}\\psi\\\\ & -\\frac{1}{4}f_{ij}f^{ij}\\ , \\end{split}\\ ] ]    where we have assumed that the electromagnetic tensor only has spatial components , i.e. @xmath34 .",
    "note that we have included the kinetic contributions of the external field , which was nt present in eq .",
    "( [ lagrangian ] ) .",
    "in this section , we argue that the only possible phases that can exist at leading order in chiral perturbation theory in the schwinger limit ( i.e. no back - reacting photons ) are phases where the charge pions remain uncondensed , in other words , we will prove that @xmath35 for all possible phases that can exist in the schwinger limit .",
    "this seems somewhat reasonable : the mechanism that was responsible for superconductivity , namely photon fields acquiring mass through spontaneous symmetry breaking , is absent now since photons can not react to the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "then it becomes favorable for the system to remain in the ground state with @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) , even for chemical potentials larger than pion masses .    in order to prove that this is indeed the case , it is useful to begin with the equation of motion for the gauge fields @xmath38 , which can be easily derived using the effective lagrangian of eq .",

    "the equation of motion for the gauge fields is @xmath39 where @xmath40 refers to the spatial components of the electromagnetic tensor and @xmath41 refers to the components of the 3-current , which is as follows : @xmath42 in the schwinger limit ( with no back - reactions ) , the photon fields @xmath43 must equal the external field @xmath44 , which for a uniform magnetic field is of the following form : @xmath45 where @xmath0 is the external magnetic field with @xmath46 and @xmath47 satisfying the constraint @xmath48 . in other words , we are working in the most general gauge configuration for a uniform magnetic field pointing in the positive z - direction . the no - back - reaction constraint on the electromagnetic tensor",

    "( [ eomphoton ] ) implies that the only way the equation of motion for photons is satisfied then is if the 3-current , @xmath41 , vanishes .",
    "the constraint is satisfied only if at least one of the constraints given below is satisfied .",
    "either @xmath50 scenario a corresponds to a chirally restored phase with the vacuum pointing entirely in the @xmath31-direction , i.e. @xmath51 and @xmath52 , a phase where the neutral pion condensate is at saturation .",
    "scenario b corresponds to a phase with @xmath35 , i.e. a phase which only allows the condensation of neutral pions ( and can not be chirally restored as we will see due to the exclusion of scenario a ) .",
    "finally scenario c is a constraint on the complex phase of one of the charge pions , either @xmath53 or @xmath54",
    ".      here we will argue that it is not possible to have any stable solutions for either scenario a or c. +   + _ scenario a : _ in order to rule out the chirally restored phase implied by scenario @xmath43 , it is important to consider all possible phases for which the condition @xmath55 is satisfied .",
    "we begin with the equation of motion for @xmath56 , which is as follows : @xmath57 it is straightforward to see from this equation that the only way in which the equation of motion is satisfied for scenario a away from the chiral limit is if @xmath58 .",
    "however , it is easy to show that this phase is unstable .",

    "however , using the second partial derivative test , the discriminant at @xmath63 assumes the following value : @xmath65 which suggests that the solution is a saddle point assuming pion masses are non - zero . in the chiral limit",

    "however , this solution is inconsistent with the second constraint of eq .",
    "( [ scenarioc ] ) . in order to prove this is indeed the case",
