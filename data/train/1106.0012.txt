    "cosmological data from a wide range of sources including type ia supernovae @xcite , the cosmic microwave background @xcite , baryon acoustic oscillations @xcite , cluster gas fractions @xcite and gamma ray bursts @xcite seem to indicate that at least 70% of the energy density in the universe is in the form of an exotic , negative - pressure component , called dark energy .    the dark energy component is usefully parameterized by its equation of state parameter , defined as the ratio of its pressure to its density : [ w ] w = p_de/_de",
    ". observations constrain @xmath2 to be very close to @xmath4 . for example , if @xmath2 is assumed to be constant , then @xmath5 @xcite .    while a cosmological constant ( @xmath6 ) remains consistent with the observations , a variety of other models",
    "have been proposed in which @xmath2 is time varying .",
    "a common approach is to use a scalar field @xmath7 as the dark energy component .",
    "the class of models in which the scalar field is canonical is dubbed quintessence @xcite and has been extensively studied .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review )",
    ".    a related , yet somewhat different approach is phantom dark energy , i.e. , a component for which @xmath8 , as first proposed by caldwell @xcite .",
    "such models have well - known problems @xcite ( however see @xcite for recent attempts to construct a stable model ) , but nevertheless have been widely studied as potential dark energy candidates .",
    "these models allow considerable freedom in the choice of the potential @xmath9 , leading to an infinite set of possible models and corresponding behaviors for the evolution @xmath2 as a function of the redshift @xmath10 .",
    "it would therefore be a considerable simplification if one could find an interesting subset of such models that converged to a single trajectory or a well - defined set of trajectories for @xmath11 .",
    "one approach that yields such a simplification was considered by scherrer and sen @xcite , who examined the evolution of a scalar field in a  nearly flat \" potential , where the flatness condition consisted of the slow - roll conditions familiar from inflation : [ sr1]^2 @xmath12 ^ 21 , + [ sr2]||1 . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we will assume for definiteness that @xmath13 and @xmath14 , but of course none our results will depend on this choice .",
    "note that while equations ( [ sr1 ] ) and ( [ sr2 ] ) are the familiar slow - roll conditions from inflation , the evolution of the scalar field is very different for the case of quintessence , since in that case one must also include the effect of the matter density on the expansion rate .",
    "@xcite considered models satisfying equations ( [ sr1 ] ) and ( [ sr2 ] ) in which the field is initially at rest , so that @xmath15 at early times , and @xmath2 increases at late times as the field rolls down the potential ; in the terminology of ref .",
    "@xcite , these are  thawing \" models",
    ". then equation ( [ sr1 ] ) ensures that @xmath2 remains close to @xmath4 , while equations ( [ sr1 ] ) and ( [ sr2 ] ) taken together indicate that @xmath16 is nearly constant .",
    "for all potentials satisfying these conditions , it can be shown that the behavior of @xmath2 can be accurately described by a unique function of @xmath17 ( the fraction of the total density contributed by the quintessence field , where we assume a flat universe ) and the ( assumed constant ) value of @xmath16 @xcite . in @xcite",
    "this result was extended to phantom models satisfying eqs .",
    "( [ sr1]-[sr2 ] ) .    in this paper , we relax the initial condition that @xmath18 , so that @xmath19 initially , but we retain both slow roll conditions on the potential ( equations [ sr1 ] and [ sr2 ] ) .",
    "this allows us to extend the formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite to models in which @xmath2 decreases toward @xmath4 at late times , rather than increasing away from @xmath4 ; the former models are called  freezing \" models @xcite .    note that the slow roll conditions , eqs .",
    "( [ sr1]-[sr2 ] ) , while sufficient to ensure @xmath20 today , are not necessary , and many other attempts to classify or simplify the set of quintessence trajectories have been proposed .",
    "for example , if equation ( [ sr1 ] ) holds , but equation ( [ sr2 ] ) is relaxed , one still has @xmath15 , but there is now an extra degree of freedom , the value of @xmath21 . instead of a single solution for the evolution of @xmath2 , one obtains a well - defined family of solutions @xcite .",
    "( this family of solutions includes the slow - roll solution of ref .",
    "@xcite as a special case in the limit where @xmath22 ) .",
    "these models were explored in more detail in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "other attempts to systematize the behavior of dark - energy quintessence fields based on other assumptions have been given in refs .",
    "@xcite . where these other approaches overlap those of this paper , further discussion and comparison with our results will be given below .",
    "in the next section , we examine the evolution of @xmath2 for slow - roll potentials with the assumption that @xmath23 initially . in sec .",
    "iii , we compare our predictions for @xmath24 with exact numerical results .",
    "our conclusions are discussed in sec .",
    "we will assume that the dark energy is provided by a minimally - coupled scalar field , @xmath7 , with equation of motion given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the hubble parameter , given by @xmath27 here @xmath28 is the scale factor , @xmath29 is the total density , and we take @xmath30 throughout . equation ( [ motionq ] ) indicates that the field rolls downhill in the potential @xmath9 , but its motion is damped by a term proportional to @xmath26 .    the pressure and density of the scalar field are given by @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively , and the equation of state parameter , @xmath2 , for the quintessence field is given by equation ( [ w ] ) .",
    "as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we note that the equations simplify if we express @xmath2 as a function of @xmath17 , giving @xmath33 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the details of this derivation ) .    consider a scalar field moving in a potential that satisfies equations ( [ sr1 ] ) and ( [ sr2 ] ) , and assume we are in a regime such that @xmath34 .",
    "note that in relaxing the initial condition that @xmath35 , it is possible to have transient evolution with @xmath2 far from @xmath4 even when equations ( [ sr1 ] ) and ( [ sr2 ] ) are satisfied .",
    "here we assume that the evolution has proceeded far enough that @xmath34 , but @xmath19 , when we begin to examine the evolution .",
    "with these assumptions , equation ( [ exact ] ) simplifies to @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the ( assumed constant ) value of @xmath16 .",

    "@xcite considered only the case @xmath41 , which corresponds to @xmath35 initially , giving @xmath42}^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equation ( [ c0 ] ) , derived as one of the main results in ref .",
    "@xcite , displays a purely thawing behavior , as the field begins initially with @xmath6 , and @xmath2 increases as @xmath7 rolls down the potential .",
    "note that at early times , when @xmath43 , we can expand equation ( [ c0 ] ) to give@xmath44}^2.\\ ] ] retaining only the first term in this expansion gives @xmath45 this agrees with the result of cahn , de putter , and linder @xcite , who defined a  flow parameter \" @xmath46 and showed that @xmath47 in the limit considered here .",
    "equation ( [ gensol ] ) when @xmath48 corresponds to the case where the field has @xmath23 initially .",
    "the case @xmath49 corresponds to a field rolling down the potential , while @xmath50 gives solutions for the field rolling uphill initially .",
    "while the latter possibility might seem somewhat contrived , it has been considered previously @xcite and we include it here for completeness .",
    "the actual value of @xmath39 depends in the initial value of @xmath40 , but it is easiest to evaluate @xmath39 in terms of the value of @xmath2 corresponding to some initial value of @xmath17 . if we designate these values as @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively , and take an early enough epoch that @xmath53 , then we have @xmath54 where the sign of @xmath39 is determined by whether the field is rolling initially up or down the potential . in terms of @xmath40",
    ", we simply have @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the ( initial but assumed nearly constant ) value of the potential .",
    "in equation ( [ gensol ] ) @xmath2 enters only in the combination @xmath57 . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ 1plusw_om ] , we display this quantity as a function of @xmath17 for the indicated values of @xmath58 . except for @xmath59 ,",
    "the generic behavior of these models is an initial freezing period , during which @xmath2 decreases rapidly with time , followed by a period of thawing , with a much slower increase of @xmath2 with time .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     our results are displayed in figs . [ w_a_linear ] and [ w_a_powerlaw ] .",
    "note that the agreement between our analytic approximation and the true ( numerically - calculated ) evolution is excellent .",
    "this demonstrates that in the regime where the slow roll conditions hold , the evolution of @xmath2 converges to a common set of tracks irrespective of the details of the underlying quintessence potential .",
    "in the limit where @xmath60 , these models correspond to a field evolving in a flat potential , @xmath61 ; these models have been dubbed  skating \" models @xcite .",
    "since we are taking @xmath62 , it is reasonable to ask whether the freezing portion of these trajectories can be well - approximated by a pure skating trajectory .",
    "an approximate skating trajectory will be realized whenever the first term in the numerator of equation ( [ exact ] ) dominates the second term ; this corresponds to the condition @xmath63 combining this result with equation ( [ gensol ] ) ( for @xmath49 ) gives the following condition for the evolution to approximate a skating solution : @xmath64    equation ( [ sk2 ] ) indicates that , for a given @xmath39 , our models approximate a skating solution at sufficently early times ( small @xmath17 ) .",
    "we can demonstrate this explicitly by solving equation ( [ exact ] ) for the case @xmath65 , giving [ wskating ] ( 1-w)(1+w ) = k , where @xmath66 is a constant . at first glance ,",
    "it is not obvious how equations ( [ wskating ] ) and ( [ gensol ] ) could correspond to the same behavior for @xmath67 ) .",
    "however , if we take the limit of small @xmath17 in equation ( [ gensol ] ) , as indicated by equation ( [ sk2 ] ) , and take @xmath34 in equation ( [ wskating ] ) ( since it is only in this limit that equation ( [ gensol ] ) will be valid ) , we see that the two expressions are , in fact , equivalent , with @xmath66 in equation ( [ wskating ] ) given by @xmath68 .",
    "we explore this equivalence in fig .  [ w_skating ] . here",
    "we plot several @xmath24 curves for the linear potential , along with the evolution of @xmath2 for the corresponding pure skating potential .",
    "as expected , the two sets of trajectories coincide at early times but diverge at late times .",
    "however , since it is the latter which is the epoch of interest observationally , the approximation developed here can not usefully be replaced by the solution appropriate to a constant potential .",
    "we have extended earlier work on nearly flat potentials to include the cases where @xmath23 initially . in these cases , the single trajectory for @xmath57 as a function of @xmath17 , derived in ref .",
    "@xcite , becomes a family of trajectories parametrized by a constant @xmath39 that depends on the initial value of @xmath40 .",
    "all such trajectories show roughly the same behavior : an initial period of freezing behavior , for which @xmath2 decreases with time , followed by a thawing period , for which @xmath2 increases .",
    "however , this thawing period can take place in the future , so these models allow for purely freezing behavior up to the present .",
    "note that behavior of this type ( with freezing followed by thawing ) was also noted in the monte carlo simulations of huterer and peiris @xcite , although their space of sampled models differs significantly from the class of models explored here .",
    "our results differ from the earlier work in refs . @xcite and @xcite , who also examined freezing models . however , these papers assumed a model that began on a tracking trajectory , with @xmath2 initially constant and far from @xmath4 , and then examined the freezing evolution as the scalar field began to influence the expansion .",
    "the models discussed here assume that the potential is sufficiently flat that @xmath2 is already close to @xmath4 at late times , so we expect very different evolution between these two cases .",
    "the results presented here can be easily generalized , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , to phantom models with a negative kinetic term .",
    "the result is simply equation ( [ gensol ] ) multiplied by @xmath4 on the right - hand side .",
    "obviously , our results apply only to a special set of quintessence potentials .",
    "however , they do provide an interesting set of restricted evolutionary paths for such potentials , and potentials satisfying the slow - roll conditions are a ",
    "natural \" way to produce the observed value of @xmath2 close to @xmath4 today .",
    "one might argue , in that regard , that the freezing models discussed here are less natural than the thawing models discussed in ref .",
    "this is a valid criticism , since in the former case one must tune the initial value of @xmath40 to give @xmath2 sufficiently close to @xmath4 at present .",
    "furthermore , the evolution discussed here can not be extrapolated arbitrarily far into the past , since this would result in an early universe dominated by scalar field kinetic energy , in contradiction to observations @xcite .",
    "thus , the slow roll conditions on @xmath9 can not be satisfied at arbitrarily early times ; the field must have evolved from a region with a different form for @xmath9 , giving a different evolution for @xmath24 in the early universe .",
    "this means that freezing slow - roll models are necessarily more complicated than the thawing models considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , which do not have similar problems with their evolution at early times .",
    "however , in the absence of any compelling _ a priori _ models for the scalar field , it is worthwhile to consider all reasonable possibilities .",
