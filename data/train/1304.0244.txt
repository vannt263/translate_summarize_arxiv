    "given a network @xmath2 , where each edge @xmath3 is endowed with a conductance @xmath4 ( the default choice for @xmath5 is 1 ) , a ( lazy ) random walk on @xmath6 repeatedly does the following : when the current state is @xmath7 , the random walk will stay at @xmath8 with probability @xmath9 and move to vertex @xmath10 with probability @xmath11 for all @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath13 be the transition probability for the random walk .",
    "then the total variation mixing time with respect to starting node @xmath8 is defined by ( see @xcite for more background ) @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the stationary measure for the random walk . here",
    "@xmath16 is the total variation distance between distributions @xmath17 and @xmath18 supported on @xmath19 .",
    "we define the ( total variation ) mixing time of the graph @xmath6 by @xmath20 .    in this note , we consider the sensitivity of the total variation mixing time when the edge conductances are multiplied by bounded factors .",
    "we say a family of graphs @xmath21 is * robust * if for every constant @xmath22 there exists a constant @xmath23 such that if we multiply the edge conductances by a factor of at most @xmath24 on these graphs , the corresponding mixing times are preserved up to a factor of @xmath25 .",
    "our main result is the following theorem .",
    "[ thm - main ] there exists a family of uniformly bounded - degree graphs that is not robust .",
    "furthermore , there exists a sequence of graphs @xmath21 with maximal degrees bounded by 10 and @xmath26 as well as a rule to change the edge - conductance up to a factor of 2 , such that the total variation mixing times in @xmath27 will change by a factor of at least @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is an absolute constant .",
    "our example in the preceding theorem is almost optimal ( except for the @xmath30 term ) , due to the well known fact that @xmath31 ( where @xmath15 is the stationary measure ) and that the spectral gap @xmath32 will be preserved up to constant under the aforementioned perturbation .",
    "there are numerous works aiming at sharp geometric bounds on mixing times such as the lovsz - kannan bound ( @xcite ) and the fountoulakis - reed bound @xcite , where an upper bound on the mixing time is derived in terms of the expansion profile of the graph ; these bounds on mixing times involving the geometry are robust under the conductance perturbation",
    ". theorem  [ thm - main ] provides a cautionary note on the possibility of developing geometric bounds on mixing times , and implies that a tight ( up to constant ) bound for the mixing time of random walks on general weighted graphs can not be robust under bounded perturbation of the edge conductances .",
    "in contrast with theorem  [ thm - main ] , many well - known families of graphs are robust .",
    "robustness of general trees was established in @xcite ; some other examples are collected in the next proposition .",
    "[ prop ] the following families of graphs are robust : ( 1 ) tori @xmath33 for every fixed @xmath34 ; ( 2 ) erds - rnyi supercritical random graph @xmath35 for a fixed @xmath36 ; ( 3 ) erds - rnyi critical random graph @xmath37 ; ( 4 ) hypercubes @xmath38 .    in view of proposition",
    "[ prop ] , it is interesting to study how generally does robustness holds .",
    "specifically , the following questions are open .",
    "are transitive graphs robust ?",
    "a special and important class of markov chains is the glauber dynamics for spin systems . in this case",
    ", we could focus on perturbation of the updating rate : that is , instead of selecting a uniform spin to update , one selects each spin with probability of between @xmath39 and @xmath40 , where @xmath0 is the size of the underlying graph and @xmath41 are positive constants .",
    "is glauber dynamics for spin systems robust under bounded perturbation of the updating rate ?",
    "one case where a positive answer to this is easily obtained is when the dobrushin contraction condition is satisfied @xcite ( see also theorem 15.1 in @xcite ) .    finally , there are other notions of mixing times involving different distances between probability measures , one of which is the @xmath42 distance @xmath43 .",
    "the robustness of the @xmath42 mixing time was studied in kozma @xcite , where he proved that @xmath42 mixing time is preserved up to a factor of @xmath30 .",
    "our result can be seen as a complementary result to @xcite .",
    "note that geometric bounds on @xmath42 mixing times have also been developed .",
    "in morris and peres @xcite , it was shown that the lovsz - kannan bound is also effective for @xmath42 mixing time , and @xcite was improved by goel , montenegro and tetali @xcite using spectral profile ( as opposed to expansion profile ) .",
    "our construction is based on two simple observations . first , by changing the conductance up to a constant factor , one could drastically change the harmonic measure ( this idea was used before by benjamini @xcite to study instability of the liouville property ) .",
    "thus , one could then decorate the graph in a subset of vertices to incur a delay for the random walk such that the delay will differ significantly before and after changing the conductances .",
    "second , the hitting time in one graph can always be translated to the mixing time for a larger graph .",
    "so the sensitivity of hitting times results in the sensitivity of mixing times ( on a larger graph ) .",
    "we now describe the construction of our graphs .",
    "we start with a simpler construction which gives a factor of @xmath44 for mixing times under a certain perturbation .",
    "first take a binary tree @xmath45 rooted at @xmath46 of height @xmath25 .",
    "we distinguish the two children of a parent by _ left _ and _ right _ child .",
    "denote by @xmath47 and @xmath48 the collection of left and right children in @xmath45 , respectively . for @xmath49:=\\{1 , \\ldots , k\\}$ ] , denote by @xmath50 the collection of vertices in the @xmath51-th level .",
    "for @xmath52 , denote by @xmath53 the collection of vertices that are in the unique path between @xmath10 and @xmath8 .",
    "define @xmath54 to be the collection of _ balanced _ nodes in @xmath45 . for every @xmath55",
    ", we attach a 3d torus @xmath56 of volume @xmath25 to @xmath10 .",
    "that is to say , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath59 for @xmath60 .",
    "denote by @xmath61 the graph obtained at this point .",
    "finally , we attach a 3-regular expander of size @xmath62 to the set of leaves @xmath63 in @xmath45 .",
    "that is to say , we attach an expander @xmath64 such that @xmath65 .",
    "we denote by @xmath66 the final graph obtained from our construction .     and",
    "@xmath67 in a binary tree of depth @xmath25 are decorated with 3d tori of volume @xmath25 .",
    "this yields @xmath61 and we add an expander @xmath68 of volume @xmath62 . on the right ,",
    "a binary tree of depth @xmath25 is decomposed into numerous binary trees of depth @xmath69 , and those between levels @xmath70 and @xmath67 are replaced by copies of @xmath71 , and then an expander is added as before.,title=\"fig:\",width=384 ] and @xmath67 in a binary tree of depth @xmath25 are decorated with 3d tori of volume @xmath25 .",

    "a binary tree of depth @xmath25 is decomposed into numerous binary trees of depth @xmath69 , and those between levels @xmath70 and @xmath67 are replaced by copies of @xmath71 , and then an expander is added as before.,title=\"fig:\",width=384 ]    we will only give a sketch for the mixing time comparison for @xmath72 , as a more detailed analysis will be given for a more delicate construction below .",
    "it is not hard to see that the mixing time on @xmath72 should be at least the hitting time from the root to the leaf set in @xmath45 .",
    "this is because when the random walk on @xmath45 travels down from the root it typically visits at least @xmath73 balanced points , the attached 3d torus will cause a delay on the hitting time by a factor of @xmath25 .",
    "that is to say , the hitting time is at least of order @xmath74 , and so is the mixing time .",
    "now , if we change the conductance on every edge @xmath75 with @xmath76 to 2 , the mixing times will still be governed by the maximal hitting time to the leaf set .",
    "also , the starting point which maximizes the aforementioned hitting time should be a node in a 3d torus attached to a balanced node deep inside the tree , such that the random walk on @xmath45 will typically spend time @xmath77 at balanced nodes before reaching @xmath63 .",
    "thus the hitting time of @xmath63 in @xmath72 is @xmath78 ( so is the mixing time ) .",
    "this shows that the mixing times will differ by a factor of order @xmath79 , completing the sketch .",
    "* main construction . *",
    "we construct the family of graphs which achieves the factor of @xmath80 as stated in theorem  [ thm - main ] . again take a binary tree @xmath45 rooted at @xmath46 of height @xmath25 .",
    "write @xmath81 , and define @xmath82 . for @xmath83 ,",
    "let @xmath84 be the complete binary subtree of @xmath45 rooted at @xmath8 of height @xmath69 .",
    "for each @xmath83 , define @xmath85 to be the collection of balanced nodes in the subtree @xmath84 .",
    "denote by @xmath86 .",
    "for every @xmath87 , we attach a 3d torus @xmath56 of volume @xmath25 to @xmath10 . finally , we attach a 3-regular expander @xmath64 of size @xmath62 to the set of leaves @xmath63 in @xmath45 .",
    "we denote by @xmath2 the final graph obtained from our construction .",
    "note that @xmath88 ( with room to spare in @xmath89 ) .",
    "now we specify a rule of changing the edge conductance in @xmath6 in order to obtain a new network supported on the same edge set as @xmath6 . for every edge @xmath75 where @xmath10 is a parent of @xmath8 , we let the new edge conductance @xmath90 if @xmath76 .",
    "the conductance of all the other edges in @xmath6 is preserved .",
    "we denote by @xmath91 this weighted graph ( or network ) . at this point",
    ", we completed the construction of our examples , and it remains to verify the mixing times on @xmath6 and @xmath92 differ by a desired factor .",
    "let @xmath95 be the hitting time to the set @xmath96 for a random walk @xmath97 on @xmath6 .",
    "we wish to bound @xmath98 from below .",
    "let @xmath99 be the graph @xmath6 without attached 3d tori .",
    "first , we consider a random walk @xmath100 on @xmath99 .",
    "denote by @xmath101 the number of times that @xmath100 visits @xmath102 before hitting @xmath96 , and denote by @xmath103 .",
    "clearly @xmath100 visits at least one vertex in every @xmath104 before reaching @xmath63 . by symmetry",
    ", we obtain that @xmath105 for a certain constant @xmath94 .",
    "note that @xmath97 can be decomposed to @xmath100 and the excursions performed in the attached 3d tori .",
    "recall a standard fact that the expected return time to the origin of a random walk is the total volume normalized by the degree of the origin .",
    "thus , every time @xmath97 visits some @xmath106 , the average time it takes the random walk for the excursion in @xmath107 is at least @xmath67 ( and the length of such excursions are independent of the random walk on @xmath99 ) .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath108 .",
    "let @xmath109 be such that @xmath110 .",
    "thus by markov property , we have @xmath111 which yields that @xmath112 since the stationary measure on @xmath96 satisfies that @xmath113 for large enough @xmath25 , we obtain that @xmath114 , as required .",
    "we first show that @xmath118 for all @xmath119 .",
    "let @xmath120 be the stopping time at which the random walk has visited @xmath96 for @xmath121 times , and denote by @xmath122 the hitting time of a @xmath123 for @xmath124 .",
    "note that @xmath125 for all @xmath119 and a certain @xmath94 , where @xmath126 .",
    "this implies that the random walk will not hit @xmath127 before @xmath120 except with exponentially small probability .",
    "also , on the rare event that the random walk does hit @xmath127 , it only increases the stopping time @xmath120 by an additive term up to @xmath128 on average .",
    "thus , we have @xmath129 .",
    "next , denoting by @xmath130 , we see that the random walk stays within @xmath131 with probability at least @xmath132 .",
    "in addition , the majority ( above @xmath133 when @xmath25 is large ) of the stationary measure is supported on @xmath96 ( and thus also on @xmath131 ) .",
    "therefore , the mixing time for the whole network is bounded by the mixing time of the induced sub - graph @xmath134 on @xmath131 from above up to a multiplicative constant .",
    "furthermore , since the induced subgraph @xmath134 is also an expander , we have @xmath135 for a finite constant @xmath24 .",
    "altogether , we have shown @xmath118 uniformly for all @xmath119 .",
    "denote again by @xmath95 the hitting time to @xmath96 . in light of the above discussion",
    ", it remains to bound @xmath136 .",
    "analogous to the proof of lemma  [ lem - original ] , we consider a random walk @xmath137 on @xmath138 , which is the network obtained from @xmath115 by ignoring the attached 3d tori .",
    "suppose @xmath137 started at some @xmath139 where @xmath140 .",
    "note that before hitting @xmath96 , the expected number of times that @xmath137 visits @xmath141 is @xmath142 for a certain constant @xmath94 ( as the random walk is biased toward the leaves ) .",
    "therefore , the expected number of times that @xmath137 visits @xmath143 is @xmath144 .",
    "also clearly , the expected number of visits to each @xmath104 is @xmath144 , thus the expected number of visits to @xmath145 is @xmath146 .",
    "next , for @xmath147 , we try to bound @xmath148 , which is the number of visits to @xmath149 before @xmath95 .",
    "observe that @xmath150 .",
    "in addition , by a simple application of large deviation principle , @xmath151 where @xmath152 is a sum of @xmath51 independent bernoulli variables ( taking values @xmath153 ) which has bias @xmath154 . therefore , we obtain that ( denoting by @xmath155 the total number of visits to @xmath127 before @xmath95 ) @xmath156 this implies that for the random walk on @xmath115 , we have @xmath157 uniformly for all @xmath158 . since the maximal hitting time for a 3d torus of volume @xmath25 is @xmath159 , this yields that @xmath160 , completing the proof of the lemma together with the fact @xmath161 for all @xmath162 .",
    "we remark that a slightly more careful analysis would lead to a ratio of order @xmath163 .",
