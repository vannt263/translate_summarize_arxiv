    "ocean currents transport water in such a way that parcels initially close become distant after some time ( _ dispersion _ ) .",
    "eventually water masses of different origins are put into contact , allowing them to interchange their contents of heat , chemicals or nutrients ( _ mixing _ ) .",
    "these two processes , dispersion and mixing , have a profound impact on the physical , chemical and biological dynamics of the ocean .",
    "the rapid development of lagrangian techniques @xcite is enhancing our understanding of them .",
    "for example , floater experiments , that directly track the motion of the water parcel on which the floater has been deployed , reveal irregular trajectories and strong dependence of them on the precise position and timing of the release . the influence of coherent structures on the trajectories , such as trapping by eddies , is also observed .",
    "one of the theoretical frameworks that is being used to understand the above phenomena comes from the mathematical study of dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "this approach identifies the main dynamical structures that provide the skeleton organizing the full set of particle trajectories .",
    "irregular trajectories and sensitive dependence on initial conditions are interpreted as the direct manifestation of the chaotic nature of fluid trajectories in the ocean .",
    "coherent structures such as eddies and fronts are also linked to well studied objects in the dynamical systems approach .",
    "although techniques for the identification of dynamical structures in time - periodic velocity flows are well established since long time ago @xcite , the consideration of aperiodic flows , as occurring in the turbulent ocean , is much more recent .",
    "a variety of methods are being tested on more or less idealized dynamical systems @xcite and some of them applied to realistic geophysical settings @xcite .",
    "a particularly simple methodology was proposed in @xcite and applied to idealized geophysical flows @xcite .",
    "the so - called _ leaking method _ consists in identifying the initial positions of particles that leave a given spatial region within a long enough interval of time .",
    "alternatively , starting positions of trajectories which end in a given region can also be identified . in both cases ,",
    "the geometrical structures of these sets of positions are related to objects of dynamical relevance . in the context of chaotic dynamical systems , they are shown to have a fractal structure , i.e. fine details with self - similar properties at arbitrarily small scales .",
    "the meaning of this in the ocean context is that these sets will show a fine filamentary structure which resembles satellite observations of sea surface temperature or ocean color images . from a practical point of view",
    ", the fine structure is the responsible for the different fate of trajectories starting in close and apparently equivalent positions .",
    "the structures revealed by the leaking method allow the identification of the _ transport routes _ between ocean regions , as well as the _ barriers to transport_. the method was originally developed to display the geometry of the transport structures .",
    "but it also gives readily the relevant time scales for escape from selected regions or residence times , an information of evident oceanographic interest @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we apply the leaking method to a realistic surface velocity field of the mediterranean sea obtained from a primitive equation ocean model .",
    "we focus in the western mediterranean , and characterize surface water exchange between a northern and a southern sub - basins , which are areas occupied by water masses of different characteristics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "[ sec : mediterranean ] we summarize the essential details of the mediterranean sea oceanography needed for the rest of the paper , and we define the regions analyzed . sect .",
    "[ sec : model ] introduces the numerical model and sect .",
    "[ sec : leaking ] describes the methodology used , i.e. the _ leaking _ and the related _ exchange _ methods . residence times and lagrangian structures for leaking out of the southern part of the western mediterranean are presented in [ subsec : residence ] , and rates of north - south exchange and associated structures in [ subsec : ns ] . in subsection",
    "[ subsec : diffusion ] we explore what modifications of the above results would be induced by unresolved small - scale turbulence , modelled here as a lagrangian diffusion process .",
    "the final section contains our conclusions .",
    "the mediterranean is a mid - latitude semi - enclosed sea connected with the atlantic ocean via the strait of gibraltar .",
    "it is composed of two principal basins , the western and the eastern basins which are connected by the strait of sicily .",
    "the main oceanographic characteristic of the mediterranean sea as a whole is that it is an evaporative basin ( evaporation exceeds precipitation ) , and the deficit of water is supplied by the inflow of atlantic waters from the strait of gibraltar .",
    "this is considered to be the main forcing mechanism of the mediterranean circulation . in a simplified view of the surface circulation , atlantic waters coming from the strait of gibraltar flow eastward along the north african coast , forming the so called algerian current .",
    "when this current reaches the strait of sicily , it bifurcates .",
    "one branch follows a cyclonic ( anticlockwise ) path around the western mediterranean basin , while the other branch crosses the strait of sicily into the eastern basin where it also follows a general cyclonic path .",
    "the longer the water stays in the mediterranean , the saltier it becomes due to mixing with adjacent water masses and to evaporation .",
    "the eastern and western mediterranean basins themselves can be divided in several sub - basins , which are separated by topographic features ( straits or channels ) and clearly characterized by different water masses , patterns of circulation and characteristic forcing mechanisms ( e.g heat fluxes , wind stress , rivers discharge , etc ) .",
    "indeed , each of the sub - basins present a variability dependent on the local forcing variability and on its own dynamics .",
    "this fact makes the mediterranean surface circulation to be depicted as different interacting scales , including large scale , sub - basin and mesoscale .",
    "the interaction between the local ( sub - basin ) circulation and the general circulation , and the connections and water transports between sub - basins , is still an open field of research of the oceanography in the mediterranean sea @xcite .",
    "we concentrate in this paper in the western basin , and characterize surface transport processes involving the relatively fresh water of atlantic origin that fills the southern part of the basin : its residence time and its interchanges with the saltier water in the north .",
    "[ fig : map ] displays the western mediterranean .",
    "the two rectangular boxes are associated to the north and south regions containing mainly the two different water masses .",
    "the southern box extends from 36n to 39n , and the northern one from 39n to 45.5n .",
    "the longitudinal extent of both is from 0 to 9e .",
    "the location of these geographical boundaries is arbitrary to some extent , but we have selected the boundary between the two regions to be at the same latitude as the ibiza channel ( the pass between ibiza , the most occidental island of the balearic cluster , and the spanish coast ) where it is known than an intense water exchange occurs @xcite .",
    "in this study , we have used the diecast ( _ dietrich for center air sea technology _ ) numerical ocean model applied to the mediterranean sea with realistic coastlines and topography .",
    "diecast @xcite is a primitive equation , z - level , finite difference ocean model using the hydrostatic , incompressible and rigid lid approximations .",
    "we summarize here some of the main properties of the model setup ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "the horizontal resolution is @xmath0 degrees while the vertical direction is discretized in @xmath1 levels .",
    "horizontal eddy viscosity and diffusivity are specified to have constant values of @xmath2 , and are represented by a laplacian operator .",
    "the use of these rather small values of dissipation in diecast is possible by the use of fully fourth - order - accurate numerics with special care to reduce numerical dispersion @xcite .",
    "it is noticeable that these values coincide with the value of the eddy diffusivity estimated by @xcite from measurement of tracer dispersion at several scales .",
    "okubo results can be summarized in his empirical formula for the diffusivity ( in @xmath3 ) as a function of spatial scale @xmath4 ( in @xmath5 ) : @xmath6 .",
    "this gives @xmath7 for our horizontal grid resolution ( @xmath8 is the approximate spacing corresponding to 1/8 of degree at mediterranean latitudes ) .",
    "vertical viscosity and diffusivity are based on @xcite , with background vertical viscosity and diffusivity set at near - molecular values ( 0.01 and 0.002 @xmath9 , respectively ) . in order to focus on the transport mechanisms intrinsic to the internal dynamics of the mediterranean , we force the model with a perpetual year using a monthly climatological wind stress and monthly climatological sea surface temperature and salinity @xcite . tracer and momentum time step is 15 minutes .",
    "model outputs are stored as instantaneous values each model day .    in this climatological configuration ,",
    "the model has been able to reproduce the correct general circulation of the basin and the major circulation features ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we used for this study the instantaneous model eulerian velocity data from the second model level ( representing the velocity field of a layer of 11.6 @xmath5 of thickness , centered at a depth of 16 @xmath5 ) . using the second layer avoids the rather direct wind influence suffered by the first one .",
    "the data correspond to four years ( @xmath10 to @xmath11 ) of a simulation taken after the model has reached an equilibrium state for the surface circulation .",
    "we consider just the horizontal components of the velocity .",
    "lagrangian motion in the horizontal is the adequate framework to compare with usual lagrangian measurements , in which typical oceanographic buoys are transported by the flow while remaining at a fixed depth .",
    "vertical velocities in the ocean are about three or four orders of magnitude smaller than the horizontal ones , so that the horizontal flow is nearly divergenceless to a good approximation in most of the considered areas ( exceptions are the places of deep water formation , which are not resolved by the climatological forcing used here ) .",
    "nevertheless , true fluid particles will finally leave the considered layer in the vertical direction at long times , so that the transport properties established here should be considered ( as floater experiments ) as a tool to explore the transport processes limited to the surface layers .",
    "the leaking method @xcite , originally developed to visualize lagrangian structures in complex flows , focus on a finite preselected region out of the full region accessible to the flow .",
    "one introduces at an initial moment @xmath12 a large number of fluid particles in this region and lets them to be transported by the flow for a time span @xmath13 , definitely longer than the natural time scale of the flow .",
    "the particles are only followed until they exit the selected region .",
    "thus , the initial ( @xmath14 ) positions of these trajectories define the location of long lifetimes inside the region . these initial positions either",
    "align in filamental features that can be shown to identify contracting directions in the flow @xcite , or they delineate coherent structures such as eddies .",
    "these structures are called the stable manifold of the invariant set or simply the _ stable manifold _ @xcite .",
    "the final ( @xmath15 ) positions of the same trajectories fall also either on coherent structures or on filaments along which trajectories are about to escape the preselected region .",
    "the tangents of this _ unstable manifold _ correspond to the local stretching directions @xcite . the shape and location of the obtained structures",
    "are functions of time ( @xmath12 for the stable and @xmath16 for the unstable manifold ) as long as the flow is time - dependent .",
    "the resolution of the filamental structures depends in addition on the initial number of tracers used ( from more particles finer structures can be recovered ) and the length of simulated time @xmath13 ( finding the appropriate simulation time is a crucial point : simulating for too short times , not all particles will be aligned along the contracting / stretching directions , whereas when simulating for a too long time the fine filamental structures fade out and disappear because of the decreasing number of particles that trace them ) . in the cases in which the transported particles undergo standard chaotic motion , the number of fluid particles @xmath17 that have not yet exit the region after a time @xmath18 decays exponentially @xmath19 @xcite , from which a escape rate @xmath20 can be measured .",
    "its inverse has the meaning of a _ residence time _ in the region . in the presence of coherent structures",
    ", however , this exponential decay slows down into a power - law at long times .",
    "although we are restricting to horizontal motion in this paper , we mention that the leaking method can be applied also to more complex threedimensional situations @xcite .",
    "in addition to the original leaking method , we propose here a modified version of it ( that we can call the _ exchange _ method ) in order to get additional information about exchange rates and transport structures between two sub - basins : we want to consider two different regions ( the northern and southern boxes in the western mediterranean map of fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] ) and calculate the transport properties between them .",
    "one of the two regions will be filled up randomly with particles .",
    "then , the motion of the particles is calculated .",
    "in contrast to the original leaking method , particles are free to leave their starting region and to move in the whole mediterranean .",
    "but at the moment in which they ( eventually ) enter the second region , the simulation of their motion is stopped .",
    "these particles are then counted as _",
    "exchanged _ ones .",
    "again , the local tangents to the initial and final distributions of non - exchanged particles identify contracting and stretching directions , and coherent structures ( and the same applies to the distribution of exchanged ones ) . in addition",
    ", the initial positions of the exchanged particles identify the _ exchange set _ , i.e. , the initial locations that contribute to transport to the second area within the considered time span . time scales for transport among the regions can be conveniently defined ( see sect .",
    "[ subsec : ns ] ) .",
    "motion of particles is calculated by using the eulerian velocity fields , previously stored from the numerical simulation .",
    "linear interpolation in time is used to downsize the @xmath21 day interval between stored data to the @xmath22 hour time - step of the 4-order runge - kutta used in the trajectory calculation . in space",
    ", we use bilinear interpolation to compute velocities in between the model gridpoints .",
    "we apply the leaking method to the southern box depicted in fig . [",
    "fig : map ] ( comprised between 0 and 9e and between 36n and 39n ) .",
    "this box is traversed by the algerian current , flowing eastwards , and contains mainly low - salinity water masses of atlantic origin ( s @xmath23 37.5 psu ) .",
    "we estimate the residence times inside the box , and the geometrical paths of escape .",
    "we put at random initial positions a large number of particles in the box .",
    "we then follow numerically during @xmath24 days the trajectories of the @xmath25 particles that were not started in land .",
    "particles are marked as escaped when they first leave the box , and their trajectories are no longer followed .",
    "the final positions of particles which remain in the box until the end of the simulation depict the unstable manifold and stretching directions , whereas their initial positions are associated to the stable manifold and contracting directions .",

    "the yearly averaged residence time in the southern basin is 59.4 days .",
    "this residence time is comparable to estimations based on lagrangian data , which gives a few months on average for a particle to escape from the algerian basin @xcite .",
    "seasonal cycle is the main component of variability in the leaking rates ( the model is forced by a seasonal atmospheric cycle ) , but note also the existence of a signal of interannual variability , which reflects non - forced interannual changes in ocean surface mesoscale structures due to the non - linear character of the ocean dynamics .",

    "there is observational evidence of an intense interchange of surface waters between these two regions , in which northern saltier waters are transported to the south to close the cyclonic western mediterranean circulation , but also southern fresher waters are found in the north @xcite .",
    "the routes of transport for this exchange , specially for the northward transport , are not still very well defined .",
    "a particle started in the south is considered to be exchanged to the north when it first hits the northern box , and viceversa .",
    "exchange during @xmath24 days is nearly equivalent to a simple crossing of the 39n parallel .",
    "this is so because o f the location of the boxes and of the coast , and because particles leaving the southern box towards the east will need a time longer than three - four months to reach the northern box moving along the italian coast .",
    "therefore , with the given geometry of the surroundings of the boxes , the exchange is comparable to a simple crossing , and the exchange rate equivalent to a crossing rate .",
    "nevertheless , in the computations we use the criteria presented when explaining the exchange method .",
    "as before , we initially fill - up the southern ( northern ) box with a large number of particles .",
    "@xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) of them did not start in land and were followed until exchange to the other box occurred .",
    "figure [ fig : exchange ] shows the decay in the number of non - exchanged particles starting from the southern box in winter of the first simulation year .",
    "it is clear that the decay now is not a simple exponential .",
    "the reason is that , as time advances , the particles are in average further and further away from the target region , so that the rate decreases in time .",

    "this imbalance is strong during all the seasons except autumn , so that there is a net annual rate from south to north , implying that surface atlantic waters from the algerian basin are , on average , crossing the 39n line and mixing with saltier waters in the north .",

    "we have characterized their seasonal variability by calculating seasonal exchange rates and residence times .",
    "the geometry of the exchange sets and the transport routes has also been investigated .",
    "residence times smaller than a season have been found inside a southern region representing the algerian basin .",
    "eddies and other complex structures are involved in the exit process from this region , being the eastern part of the region the one with fastest escape .",
    "exchange of atlantic waters towards the northern basin occurs at a higher rate , in the surface layer , than the reverse exchange . in agreement with @xcite ,",
    "eddies in the algerian basin play an important role in this transport , that is very seasonal and presents also a component of interannual variability .",
    "we expect the transport of saltier water towards the south to be more intense in deeper layers , but at surface it involves only the areas close to the boundary between the regions , and the catalan current .",
    "eddy structures are not so prominent for this transport .    small - scale turbulent process , modelled here as lagrangian diffusion , modify the exchange rates in some small amount , but does not change the qualitative picture .",
    "furthermore , the main structures and routes of transport remain , although they become smeared out ( implying stronger mixing ) at small scales .",
    "the time scales obtained using the present lagrangian approach based on a climatological numerical simulation of the mediterranean are only a first approximation to the dynamics of the real mediterranean",
    ". a numerical simulation using more accurate synoptic atmospheric forcing , including water mass formation , and a 3d study would give more realistic results .",
    "however , we showed that the actual configuration of the model gives enough complexity to define filamental structures and routes of transport between regions in the mediterranean , as well as to define the complex transport by mesoscale eddies .",
    "to conclude , we have shown that tools such as the leaking and the exchange methods are able to identify and characterize dynamical structures in aperiodic realistic flows , such as our numerically generated mediterranean circulation .",
    "the methods allow to visualize the exchange sets and transport routes in a fast and efficient way .",
    "understanding and good modelling of these structures is important to improve forecasting in practical situations : active or passive tracers released on places belonging to the exchange sets , such as for example an oil spill , will spread towards the target region .",
