    "_ attributed this to hydrodynamic interactions between sedimenting particles . although the flow around a falling sphere in shear flow is more complicated than the flows considered in the present work , it is nevertheless tempting to speculate that enhanced sedimentation velocity could be connected to a reduced effective viscosity , as occurs in ( [ visc_reduction ] ) , arising from a nontrivial coupling of the superposed flows .",
    "we leave a detailed application of our constitutive equation to the problem of sedimentation under shear to future work .",
    "an aspect of the present work which may warrant further investigation is the possible analogy between systems with isotropic interparticle interactions , upon which anisotropy is imposed by external mechanical force fields , and intrinsically anisotropic materials such as liquid crystals [ de gennes and prost ( 1993 ) , larson ( 1988 ) ] .",
    "the theory of anisotropic fluids has a long history , beginning essentially with the work of oseen in the 1930s [ oseen ( 1933 ) ] and developed through the work of ericksen ( 1959 ) and leslie ( 1968 ) . in all of these theoretical developments",
    "the anisotropy of the viscous response originates from the underlying anisotropy of the constituents ; usually oriented polymers or rod - like particles with liquid crystalline order .",
    "take the nematic phase as an example . within a continuum mechanics",
    "description the orientational order is characterized by the director @xmath217 . in certain systems",
    "the director may be held fixed by the application of a suitably strong external field , in others it interacts with the imposed flow in a more complicated way .",
    "either way , the presence of a preferred direction in the sample gives rise to an anisotropic viscous response ( characterized e.g. by the five scalar leslie viscosity coefficients ) . in the present case the anisotropy of the perturbation response",
    "is determined by the geometry of the primary flow .",
    "it may thus be anticipated that the eigenvectors of the primary deformation may play a role in the present theory analogous to that of @xmath217 in the dynamics of nematics .    throughout the present work we have focussed on the response of a glass which has already been fluidized by a primary flow of constant rate",
    ". however , within the same formalism we can also consider the predictions of our constitutive equation for the elastic response of a colloidal glass which has been pre - strained by a primary deformation at some point in the past ( see the appendix for more details on this point ) .",
    "for example , a colloidal glass subject to a shear strain below the yield strain may reasonably be expected to possess an anisotropic elastic response to an additional small perturbing strain ( see ( [ anis_elast ] ) for verification of this assertion ) .",
    "taking this idea a step further , it would be of interest to investigate the nature of the yield stress surface in such pre - strained glasses . although both the topology of the surface and its invariance with respect to hydrostatic pressure will remain unchanged by pre - straining , significant deviations from circularity ( over and above those already arising from normal stresses ) can be envisaged . in reality",
    "these deviations may well be nonstationary , decaying away as the sample ages , but such subtle dynamic effects are beyond current formulations of the mode - coupling theory .          integrating ( [ constit1 ] ) by parts yields the following form for the schematic constitutive equation @xmath218 for glassy states the modulus relaxes to a plateau value for long times and the contribution of the integral term to the overall numerical value of the stress is limited to a negligible integration over the @xmath114 relaxation ( beyond this time the time derivative vanishes ) .",
    "the integral term may therefore be neglected to a good level of approximation .",
    "we first consider the situation when the system is subjected to a mixed strain field @xmath219 , where @xmath220 is the infinitessimal strain due to flow @xmath221 .",
    "both of these strains are sufficiently small that the system remains in the purely elastic regime .",
    "the stress for long times after the application of the two strains is given by a simple linear superposition of the two elastic responses @xmath222 as is expected from the linear theory of isotropic elasticity [ landau and lifshitz ( 1986 ) ] .",
    "note that in ( [ lineareq ] ) we have suppressed an irrelevant isotropic contribution @xmath223 ( the system is incompressible ) .",
    "we next consider the situation whereby @xmath224 remains small but the strain due to the primary flow is allowed to be sufficiently large that some plastic rearrangements are induced .",
    "we nevertheless require that the total strain must still remain sufficiently small that the yield stress is not exceeded and the system remains solid .",
    "the analysis of this case neccessitates use of the partial expansion ( [ visc4 ] ) .",
    "we assume that the primary strain has been applied at some time in the distant past and that all plastic rearrangements have ceased by the time we apply the perturbing strain @xmath224 .",
