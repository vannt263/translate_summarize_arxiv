    "an intense discussion of various methods for setting confidence limits has led to a number of recent publications in the particle physics community .",
    "many such papers discuss methods for confidence interval construction in experiments with small numbers of signal events .",
    "the outcome of such an experiment is modeled by a poisson statistic @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the conditional probability of observing @xmath2 events given the signal @xmath3 .",
    "it is assumed in this note that the expected background @xmath4 is accurately known before performing an experiment and can be treated as constant .",
    "expected coverage and interval length are important properties of a method . these properties were studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , but there the discussion was mostly focused on bayesian methods with a uniform prior . in this paper",
    "i compare expected coverage and interval length for several objective bayesian methods and the unified approach  @xcite of feldman and cousins .",
    "the expected coverage for a specific method is defined as @xmath5 where @xmath6 $ ] is the confidence interval constructed for the number of events @xmath2 with this method .",
    "the expected length is given by @xmath7 for lower limit intervals @xmath8 the expected length is infinite , and instead of the length  ( [ eq : len ] ) an expected distance from zero to the lower limit is plotted : @xmath9    coverage is mostly a frequentist concept . in a bayesian analysis one is not concerned about coverage as much as about adequately representing one s objective or subjective prior belief .",
    "this , of course , should not prevent us from investigating properties of expected coverage for various bayesian methods .",
    "another important question is how one should define the desired coverage . due to the discreteness of the poisson pdf  ( [ eq : poiss ] ) , none of the methods provides exact coverage for all values of @xmath3 . in a frequentist approach one typically requires at least minimal coverage for every value of the true signal @xmath3 , and thus frequentist intervals overcover on the average .",
    "this overcoverage is not an intrinsic feature of the frequentist interval construction but merely a consequence of the empirical conservatism that many physicists find desirable .",
    "statistics literature has examples of consistent frequentist methods  @xcite that lack this minimal coverage property .",
    "one can argue that a method that gives the requested mean coverage should be preferred over the one that always overcovers .",
    "no matter what the solution to this problem is , further discussion of this issue is beyond the scope of this paper .    while confidence intervals and the expected coverage are invariant under metric transformation , the expected length and mean coverage are not .",
    "a transformation of metric , of course , involves a corresponding jacobian transformation of the prior density in a bayesian approach .",
    "for example , if the confidence interval for @xmath3 is @xmath6 $ ] , then a confidence interval for the quantity @xmath10 is obtained by a simple inversion : @xmath11 $ ] , and the expected coverage has the same functional dependence upon signal @xmath3 .",
    "but the expected interval length and mean coverage apparently change due to the choice of a new metric .",
    "in a bayesian approach one has to assume a prior probability density function @xmath12 for unknown signal and then obtain a posterior pdf @xmath13 a confidence interval @xmath14 $ ] is then found by solving equations @xmath15 for @xmath16 and @xmath17 . here , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the probabilities of the left and right tails of the posterior pdf , respectively , and @xmath20 is the confidence level of the constructed interval @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "for example , to compute a 90% upper limit , one should put @xmath21 and @xmath22 ; for a 90% lower limit these values are @xmath23 and @xmath24 ; and to obtain a 68.27% central interval , one should use @xmath25 .    in particle physics",
    "it has been customary to choose a `` non - informative '' or `` objective '' prior @xmath12 , i.e. , a prior that claims absence of any knowledge about the true signal @xmath3 .",
    "the three most popular candidates for an objective prior in a measurement without background are a flat pdf  @xcite , jeffreys prior @xmath10  @xcite and the @xmath26 prior  @xcite . the last two were derived from first principles , and the motivation for a flat prior is merely that it is `` obvious '' .",
    "if non - zero background is expected , one can apply the same first principles and obtain @xmath27 and @xmath28 for the two derived prior pdf s , respectively .",
    "one can also argue  @xcite that the @xmath26 prior should be used even if non - zero background is expected because our prior knowledge of background should not affect our prior ignorance about signal .",
    "the latter argument can be applied to the @xmath10 prior as well , but this prior gives a divergent posterior pdf for non - zero background @xmath29 and is therefore unacceptable .",
    "the discussion below is confined to these four prior pdf s : flat , @xmath27 , @xmath26 and @xmath28 .    for a prior distribution @xmath30",
    "the posterior pdf is given by @xmath31 and the confidence interval can be computed using @xmath32 where @xmath33 is an incomplete gamma - function , and @xmath34 is the standard gamma - function .    for a prior distribution @xmath35",
    "a similar derivation leads to the posterior pdf @xmath36 the confidence interval is then given by @xmath37 at @xmath38 ( flat prior ) or @xmath39 ( no background ) the posterior distributions  ( [ eq : post1 ] ) and ( [ eq : post2 ] ) are , of course , identical .",
    "the posterior pdf  ( [ eq : post2 ] ) is divergent at @xmath40 ( jeffreys prior ) and @xmath41 ( no events observed ) .",
    "i assume that this is equivalent to producing an interval of zero length and set @xmath42 in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : cov ] ) to zero .",
    "for comparison , expected coverage and length of confidence intervals constructed with the unified approach  @xcite of feldman and cousins and a simple classical method are also plotted .",
    "the simple classical approach , to which i will refer below as `` standard '' , assumes a confidence interval of the form @xmath43 $ ] for upper limit calculation and that of the form @xmath8 for a lower limit .",
    "rules for construction of frequentist confidence belts are outlined in a famous paper  @xcite by neyman .",
    "the confidence belt @xmath44 $ ] for the standard classical method is given by @xmath45 here , the same convention as in the previous section is used for @xmath18 and @xmath19 , e.g. , to compute a 90% upper limit , one should put @xmath21 and @xmath22 etc .",
    "this belt is then used to construct a confidence interval @xmath6 $ ] for a specific number of events @xmath2 in accordance with ref .",
    "expected coverage and interval length for the four objective priors and two frequentist methods are plotted versus true signal in the range @xmath46 with a step @xmath47 for 4 different values of expected background @xmath48 .",
    "the plots are shown in figs .  1 - 12 .",
    "the expected length was computed by summing terms in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : len ] ) from 0 to 100 which was enough to achieve a good accuracy for the chosen values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "both frequentist methods produce intervals of at least minimal coverage because this conservative requirement was used in construction of their confidence belts . without background the bayesian method with a flat prior and the standard classical procedure give identical upper limit values , and",
    "this is also true for the bayesian with jeffreys prior and the standard classical methods in case of lower limits . at any background the bayesian method with a flat prior",
    "provides at least minimal coverage for upper limit intervals and undercovers for lower limits , and this is reversed for jeffreys prior .",
    "none of the bayesian procedures provides minimal coverage for all values of the true signal and for all types of confidence intervals . in terms of coverage ,",
    "the @xmath28 prior is the most versatile choice among the bayesian methods .",
    "it provides a reasonable mean coverage for all types of confidence intervals while the @xmath26 prior tends to undercover for upper limits and overcover for lower limits . for central intervals",
    "the expected coverage of all bayesian methods oscillates about the required confidence level .",
    "the bayesian method with a flat prior always gives longer central and upper limit intervals than that with the @xmath28 prior , and intervals produced with this prior are in turn longer than those obtained with jeffreys @xmath27 prior .",
    "the @xmath26 prior produces short intervals at small signal values but , as the signal increases , these intervals become longer than those produced by the @xmath28 and @xmath27 priors .",
    "expected lengths for all bayesian methods approach each other asymptotically as the signal increases .",
    "the unified approach produces short 90% intervals at large signal values , but one should keep in mind that here the expected length of a two - sided unified interval is plotted as opposed to lengths of one - sided intervals for all other methods .",
