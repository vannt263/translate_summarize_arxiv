    "the strong @xmath8 problem  the absence of @xmath9 and @xmath8 violation in strong interactions  still stands as one of the fundamental puzzles of contemporary physics .",
    "the puzzle stems from the existence of vacuum topological solutions in quantum chromo - dynamics ( qcd )  @xcite . due to the axial anomaly  @xcite these topological solutions induce the non - conservation of flavor - singlet axial current .",
    "the resulting time - dependence of the axial charge leads to the picture of the physical qcd vacuum representing a bloch - type superposition of an infinite number of topologically distinct but degenerate in energy sectors connected by the tunneling transitions  so called `` @xmath10-vacuum ''  @xcite .",
    "instead of keeping track of this vacuum structure explicitly one can instead equivalently reproduce its effect by adding to the qcd lagrangian a new `` @xmath10-term '' , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the density of topological charge .",
    "unless @xmath13 , this term explicitly breaks @xmath9 and @xmath8 symmetries of qcd .    among the effects induced by",
    "the @xmath10-term is a generation of the ( @xmath9- and @xmath8-odd ) electric dipole moments ( e.d.m.s ) of hadrons .",
    "the current experimental upper bound on the neutron s e.d.m .",
    "is @xmath14  @xcite   violation through the phases in the ckm matrix , but the resulting neutron s electric dipole moment is very small , @xmath15 . ] . since inducing a non - zero electric dipole moment requires flipping the chirality of the quark that is achieved by the quark mass @xmath16 insertion , on dimensional grounds one expects @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a typical hadronic scale that we have chosen as a nucleon mass .",
    "this rough estimate combined with the experimental measurement of neutron s e.d.m",
    ".  leads to the bound @xmath19 .",
    "( a more careful analysis yields a somewhat tighter bound , @xmath20  @xcite . )",
    "the mechanism responsible for the unnatural smallness of the parameter @xmath10 has not been established yet  this represents the strong @xmath8 problem .",
    "one appealing explanation ( that however has not been confirmed yet ) promotes @xmath10 into a dynamical axion field  @xcite emerging as a nambu - goldstone boson of an additional chiral symmetry  @xcite ; for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the strength of topological charge fluctuations in qcd vacuum is quantified by topological susceptibility that is defined as a second derivative of the qcd partition function with respect to @xmath10 . on the other hand , the dependence of the partition function on @xmath10 at low energies is governed by chiral symmetry ; as a result , the topological susceptibility can be expressed in terms of @xmath21 and @xmath22  @xcite . the phase structure associated with finite @xmath10 ( especially at @xmath23 )  @xcite",
    "can also be investigated in the framework of chiral effective models  @xcite .",
    "the fluctuations of topological charge affect the mass spectrum and other properties of hadrons .    at high temperature and at weak coupling , topological fluctuations in qcd matter",
    "are enhanced due to the real - time `` sphalerons '' ( akin to the thermal activation processes )  @xcite . at temperatures",
    "not far from the deconfinement transition temperature @xmath24 the physics is essentially non - perturbative , and the description of real - time dynamics has to rely on numerical simulations or models .",
    "it was envisioned early on that @xmath9- and @xmath8-odd condensates  @xcite may develop locally in dense hadronic matter  @xcite .",
    "it is thus conceivable that @xmath9 and @xmath8 symmetry may be violated locally  @xcite .",
    "an explicit metastable solution describing a @xmath9- and @xmath8-odd `` bubble '' in hot qcd matter at @xmath25 has been found by using a chiral lagrangian description  @xcite .",
    "this metastable solution describes a local domain filled with the @xmath26 condensate ( or , equivalently , characterized by a locally non - vanishing @xmath10 ) ; it is somewhat analogous to the disoriented chiral condensate  @xcite that is however unstable even classically .",
    "it has been proposed  @xcite that in heavy ion collisions @xmath9-odd bubbles would induce certain @xmath9-odd correlations in pion momenta , but the experimental study of these correlations appeared challenging experimentally  @xcite .",
    "however some time ago it was proposed that the presence of magnetic field and/or angular momentum in heavy ion collisions opens new possibilities for the observation of @xmath9- and @xmath8-odd effects .",
    "specifically , it was found that in the presence of magnetic field and/or angular momentum the fluctuations of topological charge can be observed directly since they lead to the separation of electric charge along the axis of magnetic field due to the spatial variation of the topological charge distribution  @xcite and to the generation of electric current due to the time dependence of the topological charge density  @xcite , i.e.  the `` chiral magnetic effect '' ( cme ) .",
    "the experimental observable that is sensitive to this locally @xmath9- and @xmath8-odd charge separation in heavy ion collisions has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . the preliminary data from star collaboration at relativistic heavy ion collider at brookhaven  @xcite indicated the presence of the charge - dependent azimuthal correlations , with the magnitude consistent with the early rough estimate  @xcite .",
    "recently , star collaboration presented the conclusive observation of charge - dependent azimuthal correlations  @xcite possibly resulting from the ( @xmath9- and @xmath8-odd ) charge separation with respect to the reaction plane .",
    "because the sign of charge asymmetry is expected to fluctuate from event to event , these measurements are performed on the event - by - event basis . the experimental observable  @xcite measures",
    "the strength of charge asymmetry fluctuations ; even though it is sensitive to parity - violating effects , it is @xmath9- and @xmath8-even and so `` conventional '' backgrounds have to be carefully studied",
    ". none of the existing event generators ( such as mevsim , urqmd , and hijing ) can reproduce the observed effect  @xcite although the search for other possible explanations of course has to continue ; see e.g.  @xcite . at the same time",
    ", it is of paramount importance to establish a firm theoretical framework allowing for a quantitative study of @xmath9- and @xmath8-odd effects in heavy ion collisions .",
    "the star result has already excited significant interest , and a number of recent theoretical studies address in detail the physics of the chiral magnetic effect .",
    "the first lattice study of cme has been performed by the itep lattice gauge group  @xcite in quenched qcd .",
    "recently , the connecticut group  @xcite performed the first study of cme in full qcd with @xmath27 light - quark flavors in the domain - wall formulation .",
    "these lattice studies provide an important confirmation of the existence of cme , but also highlight a need for a quantitative theoretical understanding of the involved non - perturbative phenomena . in this paper",
    "we will attempt to reproduce some of the lattice results in an analytical approach .",
    "the behavior of cme at strong coupling in the sakai - sugimoto model and related theories has been explored through the ads / cft correspondence in refs .",

    "@xcite that the magnitude of cme at strong coupling is not modified relative to the weak coupling case , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite argue that the effect disappears in the strong coupling limit . in ref .",
    "@xcite the cme at low temperatures has been studied using the instanton vacuum model .",
    "the electric dipole moment of qcd vacuum in the presence of external magnetic field has been evaluated in ref .",
    "@xcite using the chiral perturbation theory .",
    "extensive studies of the local @xmath9- and @xmath8 violation in hot hadronic matter and of the influence of magnetic field on the phase transitions have been performed in ref .",
    "the properties of hadronic matter in external magnetic fields have attracted significant interest recently  @xcite .",
    "the analytical  @xcite and numerical  @xcite evaluations of the strength of magnetic field produced in heavy ion collisions yield the values of the order of @xmath28 for rhic energies , making it possible to study the interplay of qcd and qed phenomena .",
    "the violation of parity in cold and dense baryonic matter has been investigated in refs .",
    "a closely related problem is the @xmath10-dependence in hadronic matter at finite baryon and isospin densities  @xcite as well as at high temperatures @xcite .",
    "let us now discuss the physics of cme in more detail .",
    "first , note that a constant ( homogeneous in space and time ) @xmath29 can not induce the cme .",
    "this is because the @xmath10-term in the qcd lagrangian represents a full divergence and thus can not affect the equations of motion .",
    "the cme electric current can be induced only when @xmath10 changes in time from a finite value in the metastable state toward zero in the ground state ; a spatially inhomogeneous @xmath10 distribution induces the electric dipole moment  @xcite . to give a quantitative description of the cme , in ref .",
    "@xcite we used the chiral chemical potential @xmath30 that is proportional to the time derivative of @xmath10 : @xmath31 .",
    "the anomaly relation allows us to find an exact expression for the induced current which is proportional to @xmath1 and @xmath30 . in analogy to the ordinary relation between the current and the electric field through the electric conductivity , the coefficient of the current in response to @xmath1 can be called the `` chiral magnetic conductivity . '' in ref .",
    "@xcite the chiral magnetic conductivity was computed as a function of the energy and the momentum at weak coupling .",
    "the chiral magnetic conductivity was then evaluated by holographic methods also at strong coupling  @xcite .    the experimental observable studied by star @xcite measures the strength of event - by - event fluctuations of charge asymmetry relative to the reaction plane , i.e.  along the direction of magnetic field ( and of orbital momentum ) .",
    "therefore the quantity that needs to be evaluated theoretically is the correlation function of electric charge asymmetry ; under some reasonable assumptions it can be related to the susceptibility of the cme electric current .",
    "this quantity has also been computed recently in the lattice qcd simulation  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will compute the electric - current susceptibility in an analytical approach .",
    "we hope that this calculation will serve as a step in a quantitative theoretical understanding of both experimental and lattice results . in our study",
    "we consider explicitly only the quark sector ; we justify this by the absence of perturbative corrections to the axial anomaly that is driving the cme .",
    "this is justified at weak coupling  in other words , the cme current is not perturbatively renormalized . whether or not the cme current undergoes a non - perturbative renormalization , or whether it survives in the strong coupling limit , is still an open question  @xcite .",
    "we will characterize the real - time dynamics of topological charge in the system by a certain distribution in the chiral chemical potential @xmath30 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : observable ] we briefly review the experimental observable accessible at present in heavy ion collisions and motivate the connection between this observable and the electric - current correlation function and susceptibility . the following sec .",
    "[ sec : susceptibility ] is divided into four subsections : first , we re - derive our previous result for the cme current  @xcite and compute the longitudinal susceptibility using the thermodynamic potential .",
    "calculating the transverse susceptibility is not so straightforward as the longitudinal one , and we explain our method of computation in the three following subsections .",
    "we then proceed to sec .",
    "[ sec : data ] where we make a comparison of our results to the lattice qcd data and provide the formulae that can be used in the description of experimental data . finally , we summarize in sec .  [",

    "in heavy ion collisions at any finite impact parameter the distribution of measured ( charged ) particles depends on the azimuthal angle @xmath32 .",
    "the hadron multiplicity as a function of @xmath32 can be decomposed into fourier harmonics : @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the number of positively and negatively charged particles respectively , and @xmath36 is the angle relative to the reaction plane .",
    "the coefficients @xmath37 and @xmath38 quantify the strength of `` directed '' and `` elliptic '' flows respectively ; they are not expected to depend on whether measured particles are positively or negatively charged . on the other hand , the term proportional to @xmath39 is @xmath9- and @xmath8- odd and describes the charge separation relative to the reaction plane  in other words , as sketched in fig .",

    "we shall denote this averaging procedure by @xmath44 throughout this paper . because the topological excitations fluctuate not only locally ( point - by - point in space ) but also globally ( event - by - event )",
    ", @xmath45 becomes zero and the symmetry is restored in a sense of average .",
    "it is necessary , therefore , to measure the correlation functions @xmath46 ,",
    "@xmath47 , and @xmath48 , which are invariant under @xmath9 and @xmath8 transformations and thus their ensemble average is non - vanishing .",
    "the experimental observable sensitive to @xmath49 was proposed by voloshin  @xcite : @xmath50 here @xmath51 and @xmath52 indicate either @xmath53 or @xmath54 charge of measured particles , and the sum goes over all charged hadrons in a given event .",
    "this observable has an important property that becomes clear when one explicitly isolates the terms @xmath55 driven by fluctuating backgrounds  @xcite : @xmath56 if the in - plane @xmath57 and out - of - plane @xmath58 backgrounds are the same , they cancel out and since for a symmetric heavy ion collision in a symmetric rapidity cut @xmath59 , one can identify the above ( [ eq : voloshin ] ) with @xmath60 that serves as an order parameter for @xmath9- and @xmath8-odd effects .",
    "let us now take a further step to establish a link between the above experimental observable and the theoretical computation . in theory a clear manifestation of the cme is spontaneous generation of an electric current , @xmath61 , along the direction parallel to the applied magnetic field , @xmath62  @xcite .",
    "we can anticipate that this electric current of quarks , if @xmath63 , would induce @xmath42 and @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dndphi ] ) for the observed hadron distributions .",
    "this is due to i ) the quark - hadron duality and ii ) the rapid transverse expansion of the system that prevents the charge asymmetry from being smeared out by thermal diffusion .",
    "it seems natural that a theoretical quantity relevant to @xmath64 should be a correlation function or fluctuation with respect to the electric current . for one event",
    "it would be legitimate to accept the following relations : @xmath65 indeed , @xmath66 , for example , counts an excess of positively charged particles in the region near @xmath67 ( i.e.  moving in the @xmath68 direction ) as compared to that near @xmath69 ( i.e.  moving in the @xmath70 direction ) .",
    "here we defined @xmath71 and @xmath72 as the transverse and longitudinal coordinates , respectively . from now on , to make our notation more general , we will use @xmath73 and @xmath74 instead of specific coordinate indices ; namely @xmath73 is a current component perpendicular to @xmath62 and @xmath74 parallel to @xmath62 .",
    "we can then identify @xmath75 note that we have neglected the screening ( absorption ) effect by the medium for the moment ; we will discuss the medium screening in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : data ] .    to connect these expressions to the experimental observables",
    "we should further take the average @xmath44 . computing this event average",
    "would however require a complete real - time simulation describing the dynamics of topological transitions in the produced matter .",
    "since such a simulation goes beyond the scope of the present work , here we will adopt the following _ working definition _ for the correlation function that is related to the experimental data .    1 .",
    "first , we identify the fluctuation measured on the event - by - event basis with the spatial correlation function obtained in the field theory calculation .",
    "this is a common assumption used for example also in discussions on the qcd critical point search  @xcite .",
    "if the system s volume is sufficiently larger than the correlation length , this assumption should make sense .",
    "second , we compute the correlation function for a fixed value of the chiral chemical potential @xmath30 that induces a difference in number between right - handed and left - handed particles ; @xmath76 .",
    "third , we make a convolution of the results at fixed @xmath30 with a weight function of the @xmath30 distribution .",
    "we will adopt a gaussian ansatz for the weight function ; the dispersion is characterized by the rate of topological transitions depending on the system s temperature .",
    "one may wonder whether the above - mentioned procedure is a correct one , or merely a convenient assumption .",
    "suppose that @xmath77 and @xmath78 were computed from the first principles of quantum field theory avoiding the steps ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) above , as is the case for the lattice qcd simulations",
    ". then one might think that the results are to be interpreted as quantities directly relevant to the experimental data .",
    "we think however that the situation is not so simple .",
    "the difficulty lies in the different dynamics of topological excitations in euclidean and minkowski space - times . in the case of euclidean space - time",
    "the instantons are exponentially suppressed by the boltzmann factor , while in minkowski space - time the sphalerons are not  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is essential to take account of sphaleron - like effects in real - time dynamics . if we make use of the imaginary - time formalism of the finite - temperature field theory , it would describe properly the instanton transitions but would miss the unsuppressed sphaleron contributions unless the analytical continuation is correctly formulated .",
    "usually the analytical continuation from the imaginary- to the real - time dynamics is not obvious though",
    ". it would thus be appropriate to solve the real - time dynamics e.g.  by using the spatially discretized hamiltonian  @xcite in the presence of external magnetic field .",
    "this is however quite difficult technically and hence , in this work , we have employed a pragmatic approach assuming that the computation of the spatial correlation function at finite @xmath30 and the computation of the average over the distribution in @xmath30 ( that is governed by the real - time dynamics ) are separable .",
    "such a separability would hold for example if the cme response of the system to a finite @xmath30 were much faster than the dynamics responsible for the generation of the distribution in @xmath30 , and the back - reaction of the cme current on topological transitions could be neglected .",
    "we think that this is a plausible assumption since the generation of the cme current in response to a finite @xmath30 is not damped by interactions with gluons , and at least at large @xmath5 the back - reaction of the cme current on the topological dynamics of gluon fields can be neglected . in this approach",
    ", the properties of the topological transitions in hot qcd medium such as the sphaleron rate are incorporated through the weight function for the @xmath30-distribution .",
    "the correlation function , in general , has two contributions : one is from a disconnected ( tadpole - tadpole type ) diagram and the other from a connected diagram .",
    "the former is related to the expectation value of the induced current , and the latter is given by the corresponding susceptibility .",
    "here we introduce the following notations : @xmath79 we note that @xmath80 and @xmath81 above are an expectation value and susceptibility of the electric current , respectively , for a fixed value of @xmath30 . under our assumptions listed above",
    ", the ensemble average reads , @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the weight function normalized such that @xmath84 ( and thus @xmath83 has a mass dimension in our definition ) .",
    "we will specify this function later .",
    "the overall constant , @xmath85 , is treated as a free parameter which is independent of collision geometry , and we approximate @xmath86 .",
    "it is interesting to see that the combination of the transverse and longitudinal current correlators in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cosdphi ] ) has a clear correspondence to the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : voloshin ] ) . in @xmath87",
    "together with eq .",
    "( [ eq : susceptibility ] ) , there is a cancellation between major components in @xmath88 and @xmath89 , that is interpreted as the cancellation between backgrounds @xmath57 and @xmath58 discussed above .",
    "however , because of the presence of the external magnetic field the cancellation is not necessarily exact , which gives a background on top of the cme contribution from @xmath90 .",
    "if we neglect the quantum fluctuation of gauge fields on top of the external magnetic field @xmath1 , we can explicitly accomplish the integration in the quark sector with full inclusion of @xmath1 .",
    "we can write down the thermodynamic grand potential at finite @xmath4 and @xmath91 , which is defined by @xmath92 from the partition function @xmath93 , given as  @xcite , @xmath94 \\ , , \\label{eq : omega}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 refer to the flavor , spin , and landau level indices , respectively .",

    "@xmath103 refers to the @xmath72-component of the three momentum @xmath104 ( not the third component of @xmath105 which has an additional minus sign from the metric ) .",
    "we can calculate the expectation value and the susceptibility of the electric current operator by taking a functional derivative with respect to the ( source ) gauge field @xmath106 as discussed in ref .  @xcite .",

    "on the other hand a sphaleron excitation near the surface can easily escape from the medium , and then it should contribute to the total current fluctuations if the correlator is for same charges . in the case of opposite charges , however , as is clear from our discussions in sec .",
    "[ sec : observable ] , fluctuations arise from , for example , an upgoing positive charge and a downgoing negative charge .",
    "thus , one of two charges must be significantly quenched by the medium . in ref .",
    "@xcite a phenomenological ansatz for such effects was introduced by the following functions ; @xmath316 \\ , , \\\\",
    "h(b / r,\\lambda / r ) & \\equiv \\frac{1}{r^2}\\int_{-r+b/2}^{r - b/2 } { \\mathrm{d}}x    \\int_{z_-(x)}^{z_+(x ) } { \\mathrm{d}}z\\ ;    \\xi_+(x , z)\\,\\xi_-(x , z ) \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the correlations with same and opposite charges , respectively , where @xmath317\\ ] ] with a phenomenological screening length @xmath257 and @xmath318 is the surface of matter . here",
    "@xmath319 is the impact parameter , @xmath320 is the radius of the nucleus .",
    "we postulate that the superposition of the sphaleron domains with @xmath3 over the whole system geometry amounts to the system volume factor with the quenching effect taken into account , that is , @xmath3 is replaced as @xmath321 at this point let us think of the @xmath30-integration . the latter term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : av_cos ] ) does not have any @xmath30 dependence , so the @xmath30-integration is trivial leading to @xmath322 .",
    "the former term , in contrast , is proportional to @xmath323 .",
    "this means that @xmath323 after the integration turns to be a parameter ( denoted as @xmath324 here ) characterizing the dispersion of the @xmath30 distribution .",
    "consequently we have the final expressions for the respective cases with the same and opposite charges ; @xmath325 \\ , , \\label{eq : final_result++}\\ ] ] and @xmath326 given by almost the same with @xmath327 replaced by @xmath328 in the above . here",
    "we note that we should identify @xmath329 as @xmath330 where @xmath331 is the sphaleron rate which is proportional to @xmath332 at high @xmath4 and thus @xmath333 represents how much topological excitations occur within a time slice @xmath334 . by the dimensional reason @xmath335 appears .",
    "then we clearly see that the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : final_result++ ] ) has exactly the same structure as the expression discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite apart from its overall coefficient once it is integrated over the time ; @xmath336 . in this way we have established a relation between the formalism addressed here and the previous work in ref .",
    "@xcite .    to proceed to more concrete analysis we need to specify @xmath257 , @xmath337 and @xmath338 as a function of @xmath319 ( or the centrality ) .",
    "although those phenomenological analyses are important , we will postpone such investigations and discuss them in a separate publication which focuses more on the phenomenology of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "in this paper we formulated the chiral magnetic effect in terms of the electric - current correlation function in a hot qcd medium .",
    "we computed the electric - current susceptibility in the presence of both the magnetic field @xmath1 and the chiral chemical potential @xmath30 .",
    "because of the presence of a preferred direction fixed by @xmath62 , we found that the longitudinal ( parallel to @xmath1 ) susceptibility @xmath297 is greater than the transverse ( perpendicular to @xmath1 ) one @xmath298 .",
    "the difference arises from only the landau zero - mode and is given by a uv - finite expression ; @xmath339 .",
    "we also gave an intuitive derivation of our result based on the anomaly relation .",
    "we checked that our result leads to a satisfactory agreement with the electric - current susceptibility measured in the lattice qcd simulation @xcite .",
    "although @xmath340 has an origin in the anomaly , the expression for @xmath340 shows that this difference is independent of @xmath30 and thus is not sensitive to the real - time topological contents of the qcd matter . therefore we should identify it as a background on top of the cme contribution stemming from the square of the induced cme current . since the cme - induced current is proportional to @xmath1 and @xmath30 ,",
    "the charge - asymmetry fluctuation relevant to the cme has a dependence of @xmath341 and @xmath323 which translates into a dispersion parameter of the @xmath30-distribution ; on the other hand , the non - cme term is proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "it would be an interesting question to check if this expected quadratic dependence on @xmath1 can be seen in a lattice simulation restricted to a particular topological sector of qcd , that would correspond to a highly excited vacuum configuration resembling the matter produced in a heavy ion collision .",
    "there is an urgent need at the moment in the quantitative phenomenological approaches to cme that on one hand have a firm theoretical ground and on the other hand allow a direct comparison to the experimental data from rhic  @xcite .",
    "we view the computation presented here as a necessary step towards a construction of such an approach .",
