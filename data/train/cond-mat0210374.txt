    "in collisions between two bodies which have internal degrees of freedom , some of the initial translational energy is transformed into internal energy of the two bodies .",
    "this is the major cause of energy dissipation . to characterize the macroscopic features , a phenomenological parameter , the coefficient of restitution ( cor ) , @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are translational kinetic energy before and after the collision , respectively , is commonly used .",
    "recent studies of collisions are mainly focused on the determination of @xmath3 from microscopic mechanisms .",
    "hertz developed the theory of collision between frictionless elastic bodies @xcite based on his static theory of elastic contact @xcite . in the theory , it is assumed that in low - velocity collisions , the deformation of colliding bodies is given by the static theory and the production of vibration is totally ignored .",
    "hence , the theory gives no information on energy dissipation .",
    "plastic deformation is one of the possible means of kinetic energy dissipation during collisions . taking this into account",
    ", the energy dissipation rate @xmath4 is found to increase with collision velocity with a power law with the exponent @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "considering viscoelastic properties , the dissipation rate increases with the exponent @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "these results were confirmed experimentally @xcite .",
    "the results presented above are based on quasi - static approximation , hence it is expected that they are restricted to low - velocity collisions .",
    "we believe that more general results will be obtained through microscopic simulations @xcite .",
    "sugiyama and sasaki @xcite and basile and dumont @xcite considered collisions between simple one - dimensional chains and a rigid wall",
    ". a chain is composed of @xmath7 identical point particles which interact with nearest - neighbor particles .",
    "if we choose linear force as the interaction between the particles , the cor is independent of collision velocity and approaches unity in the thermodynamic limit .    for collision between metallic bodies ,",
    "plastic deformation usually occurs even if collision velocity is low .",
    "the deformation exceeds the elastic regime in which hooke s law remains valid @xcite .",
    "hence nonlinear effects are important in realistic collisions . in this study",
    ", we choose nonlinear force as the interparticle interaction and perform the one - dimensional simulations of collision between a `` nonlinear chain '' and a rigid wall .",
    "we find that the cor of this collision has a minimum value at a certain velocity and derive the velocity dependence of the cor for low - velocity collisions using perturbation methods .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we briefly review the studies of sugiyama and sasaki @xcite and basile and dumont @xcite . in section 3 ,",
    "we present our results for collision between nonlinear chains and a wall .",
    "finally , we summarize our results .",
    "first we briefly discuss the collision of one - dimensional harmonic chains ( model a ) with a rigid wall as discussed by sugiyama and sasaki  @xcite .",
    "consider a chain composed of @xmath7 identical point particles labeled @xmath8 .",
    "each particle in the chain is linked to nearest - neighbor particles with a hooke s spring , as illustrated in fig.[fig : model ] .",
    "the hamiltonian of this system is written as     schematic of a one - dimensional chain and a rigid wall.,height=188 ]    @xmath9    where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the position and velocity of the @xmath12-th particle , respectively , and @xmath13 is the natural length of the springs .",
    "we assume the chain is homogeneous and all springs have the same spring constant @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 represents the hard - core potential of a rigid wall located at @xmath16 where collision takes place . during the collision process",
    ", only the particle @xmath17 , which is at the end of the chain , interacts with the wall since the positional order of the particles is always kept as @xmath18 . in the following discussion , we assume that the wall is so rigid that the particle @xmath19 simply reverses its velocity as @xmath20 .    although there is no dissipation term in the hamiltonian , vibration energy which remains after the collision is regarded as the `` dissipated '' portion of energy .",
    "the cor @xmath3 is therefore evaluated as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the total energy and @xmath23 is the vibration energy which remains after the collision .    in the absence of @xmath24 , the equation of motion",
    "is written as @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 is an @xmath29 matrix of the form @xmath30 taking a principal - axis coordinate system in which @xmath31 is diagonal , internal vibration of the chain can be represented using @xmath7 noninteracting fundamental modes . in the presence of @xmath24 , collision between the chain and the wall",
    "is realized as follows .",
    "assume that the particle @xmath17 collides with the wall @xmath32 times at @xmath33 .",
    "the fundamental modes describe equi - energy elliptical orbits in phase space .",
    "the orbits are discontinuous at @xmath34 .    for the following numerical simulations , we choose initial conditions @xmath35 before collision",
    ", the chain has no internal vibration , _",
    "i.e. , _ zero temperature . figure [ fig : collisionwithwall ] shows the collision between the wall and the chain with @xmath36 . each line is a trace of the trajectory of a particle . in the plot ,",
    "units on the time axis are taken as @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath38 indicates the duration in which the longitudinal sound wave propagates from one end of the chain to the other .",
    "let us call the time @xmath39 during which the collision takes place `` contact time '' . here",
    "we note that contact time is almost equal to @xmath40 for large @xmath7 .",
    "cor and contact time are independent of the collision velocity of the chain because time intervals @xmath41 are independent of initial velocity for every @xmath42 and the orbits retain similar forms even if initial velocity of the chain varies .",
    "therefore , @xmath43 , the ratio of the @xmath12-th fundamental mode energy to total energy , does not depend on initial velocity .",
    "the cor , which is a ratio of energy , also does not depend on initial velocity .",
    "hereafter , we use the reduced unit @xmath44 , setting @xmath13 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 as unity",

    "an approximate expression of @xmath3 was derived by basile and dumont@xcite . to simplify the problem",
    ", we assume that @xmath48 and the velocity before the @xmath42-th collision @xmath49 are constant for every @xmath42 .",
    "numerical simulations show that these are good approximations . under this assumption ,",
    "the vibration energy of the @xmath12-th mode after the collision process is given as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the frequency of the @xmath12-th mode , which is @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath53 , @xmath32 and @xmath54 are determined from numerical simulations @xcite .",
