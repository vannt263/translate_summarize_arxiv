    "the coma cluster of galaxies , abell 1656 ( * ? ? ? * hereafter referred to as coma ) , has been among the most well - studied galaxy clusters ( e.g. , see the review by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at @xmath10",
    "@xcite it is nearby , yet significantly richer than virgo and more accessible than perseus ( a426 ) , which lies near the galactic plane .",
    "studies of coma have shaped our understanding of galaxy evolution in the cluster environment . in assessing the frequency of blue galaxies in intermediate redshift clusters , coma was one of several nearby clusters used as a benchmark for establishing the `` butcher - oemler effect '' @xcite .",
    "although the fraction of blue galaxies decreases with decreasing redshift and therefore the activity level of coma is presumably low , studies have still revealed galaxy evolution in progress . @xcite and @xcite have studied images and spectroscopy of coma galaxies to reveal populations of starbursts and post - starburst galaxies , and related these findings to substructures within coma and hence connected the star - formation history of galaxies to cluster environment . in particular ,",
    "coma member starburst and post - starburst galaxies are preferentially located in the regions around ngc  4839 which appears to be a large infalling group @xcite although others have argued for this system being seen shortly after passage through the core of coma @xcite .",
    "similar studies have contrasted coma with higher redshift clusters ; at higher redshift more luminous galaxies are observed to constitute the starburst and post - starburst populations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while sources in coma with similar spectroscopic signatures are fainter dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "this suggests that `` downsizing ''  the shift in star - formation activity to lower mass systems  is occurring , and that some of the butcher - oemler effect is the result of applying a fixed absolute magnitude cutoff to both low and high redshift systems .",
    "recently , coma has been studied to greater depth using the william herschel telescope ( wht ) . @xcite",
    "presented optical imaging in five @xmath11 fields , with @xcite using the imaging to select targets for spectroscopy for the `` core '' and `` outskirt '' fields : `` coma 1 '' centered at 12@xmath1259@xmath13452 @xmath1427@xmath1557531 , and `` coma 3 '' at 12@xmath1257@xmath13285 @xmath1427@xmath1508085 and having ngc  4839 near its northern edge .",
    "the southwest corner of the coma 1 field overlaps slightly with the northeast corner of the coma 3 field , meaning that combined they define a contiguous total area of about 0.92 square degrees ( refer to figure [ fig - rmsconts ] ) .",
    "these photometric and spectroscopic data were used to construct the cluster optical luminosity function @xcite , study stellar population ages and metallicities @xcite , investigate the effect of environment on galaxy properties and compare the findings to higher redshift clusters @xcite , and examine cluster dynamics for both giant galaxies and dwarfs @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the best wide area 1.4  ghz radio continuum survey of coma to date is the faint images of the radio sky at twenty centimeters survey ( first ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with a limiting sensitivity of 1 mjy and 5 resolution ,",
    "the first data are capable of detecting coma member sources with @xmath16 w  hz@xmath4 .",
    "this amounts to radio luminosities about half that of the milky way and greater @xcite , or in terms of a star formation rate ( sfr ) about 0.7 m@xmath9  yr@xmath4(assuming a salpeter imf from 0.1 to 100 m@xmath9 , using the relationship of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while this is a useful limit for studies of active galaxy populations in clusters ( e.g. , *",
    "* identify an average of @xmath010 radio - detected galaxies per cluster down to this limit and within each cluster s abell radius ) , the proximity of coma makes it relatively easy to study hitherto unexplored fainter radio galaxy populations .",
    "deeper 1.4  ghz observations in the vicinity of ngc  4869 , the prototypical head - tail radio galaxy at the core of coma , are presented in @xcite .",
    "these data reach an rms sensitivity of about 30 @xmath1jy at about the same resolution as first , and have the added benefit of full polarization information .",
    "they are of very limited areal coverage ( a few square arcminutes ) , however , on account of bandwidth smearing .",
    "similarly , the excellent h  i observations of spiral galaxies in coma have narrow total bandwidths and hence relatively poor radio continuum sensitivity ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* the rms for 1.4  ghz continuum of these data is about 0.2 mjy ) .",
    "these data show evidence for cluster environmental effects in the form of ram pressure stripping , including asymmetric h  i morphologies and greater gas deficiencies for galaxies near the core of the cluster .",
    "there is also a wealth of new multiwavelength data available for coma .",
    "x - ray satellites have imaged both the core and large - scale regions of the cluster ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite and _ xmm _ ( hornschemeier et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "fewer prior data exist in the ultraviolet ( uv ) , although coma was observed by the foca balloon - borne imaging telescope @xcite .",
    "however , new uv data from _ galex _ including a deep observation centered on coma 3 are now available and indicate a faint - end slope to the uv lf that is steeper than comparable field uv lfs @xcite .",
    "although more traditionally associated with star formation , the uv data from _ galex _ detect numerous elliptical galaxies , even down to less luminous , dwarf - like objects .",
    "the reason for this is emission from extreme horizontal branch stars , known as the `` uv upturn '' in their spectra @xcite .",

    "in the infrared ( ir ) , _ spitzer _ is producing interesting results on the cluster .",
    "near - ir observations with irac ( 3.6  8.0 @xmath1 m ) are reported in @xcite for the coma 1 and coma 3 regions , and also suggest a steep faint - end slope for the near - ir lf .",
    "these lf results are indicative of an excess of dwarf galaxies relative to optically - selected samples . at longer ir wavelengths",
    ", @xcite constructed 24 @xmath1 m and 70 @xmath1 m lfs using _ spitzer _ mips and found their overall shape to be consistent with field lfs .",
    "they did , however , find evidence for environmental effects in the form of different slopes for the core and infall regions .",
    "to complement these deep and wide area multi - waveband datasets , we used the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) very large array ( vla ) to obtain deep 1.4  ghz images of the core ( coma 1 ) and outskirts ( coma 3 ) of the coma cluster .",
    "our observations reach 22 @xmath1jy , or @xmath17 w  hz@xmath4 for galaxies at the distance of coma . for coma members powered by star formation",

    "@xcite find the median sfr of blue compact dwarf galaxies as determined by 1.4  ghz emission to be 0.3 m@xmath9  yr@xmath4 , implying that our vla survey should be sufficiently sensitive to provide radio detections for some of the brighter dwarfs , and useful upper limits for non - detections .",
    "the radio source catalog derived from our vla observations has been correlated with the sdss optical data to explore the radio galaxy population of coma , and by extension numerous radio sources lying behind the cluster .    in this paper",
    ", we present the observations , data reduction , and resulting source catalogs .",
    "a related paper investigates the characteristics of the radio - detected coma member galaxies and derives the cluster radio luminosity function @xcite . for all distance - dependent calculations ,",
    "we assume a redshift of @xmath10 corresponding to a distance modulus of 35 using the standard wmap cosmology @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with distances to coma derived using a host of other techniques ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the vla observations were performed over five days in june 2006 as program code am868 . on each of the five days the scheduled time was centered on the transit of coma .",
    "the vla was in its b , or second largest , configuration . in order to obtain nearly - uniform sensitivity across the @xmath19 areas corresponding to coma 1 and coma 3 ,",
    "mosaics of individual pointings were made .",
    "these amounted to 11 separate pointings for each field , arranged in a hexagonal grid with 125 between adjacent pointings ( see table [ tbl - points ] and figure [ fig - rmsconts ] ) .",
    "this grid spacing insures that all regions of the coma 1 and coma 3 fields with the exception of small areas in six of the corners lie within the half - power response of more than one pointing .",
    "observations of 3c286 for primary flux density calibration and 1310 + 323 for bandpass and phase calibration meant that each of the 22 total pointings received just under one hour of total integration . to minimize the time spent slewing while still obtaining good ( u , v ) coverage , we devoted individual days to coma 1 and coma 3 ( 2 days each ) and reobserved all 22 pointings on the fifth day . on days",
    "when a single field was targetted we observed each of its 11 pointings twice for about 11.5 minutes each time , with the order shuffled on the other date that field was observed .",
    "thus , in total each pointing received five individual @xmath20 minute observations at five different hour angles , resulting in excellent total ( u , v ) coverage as demonstrated in figure [ fig - uvcover ] for the centermost pointing within the coma 1 field .",
    "the correlator was operated in the standard multichannel continuum mode used for deep , wide - field 1.4  ghz observations .",
    "this corresponds to seven 3.125  mhz channels in each of two bands ( called `` intermediate frequencies '' or ifs ) centered at 1.365 and 1.435  ghz , respectively , with each if receiving both left and right circular polarizations ( hence 28 total channels ) .",
    "the smaller channels alleviate bandwidth smearing while still providing a fairly large total bandwidth and thus increasing the sensitivity . at the time of the observations",
    "the vla had just begun its transition to the expanded vla ( `` evla '' ) , with individual vla antennas being retrofitted with evla receivers and electronics .",
    "depending on the date of the observations either three or four evla anntennas were used in the observations on a shared - risk basis , along with 22 standard vla antennas .",
    "the evla antennas were operated in the same manner as the standard vla antennas ( e.g. , same observed frequency channels ) , so the benefits of including them were simply the increased number of array elements .",
    "the data were reduced using the astronomical image processing software ( aips ) package , version 31dec06 .",
    "the flux density scale was tied to 3c286 , which was bootstrapped to the phase calibrator 1310 + 323 .",
    "this latter calibrator was observed approximately every 45 minutes and also was used for calibrating the bandpasses .",
    "some flagging of data was necessary , usually for the evla antennas .",
    "for example , one evla antenna ( the one most recently brought into service ) provided useable data for only one if and polarization .",
    "the others were reliable with the exception of short periods of time usually at the conclusion of each day s observations .",
    "once the data were calibrated , the initial steps toward producing final images were made by pointing i d and observation date .",
    "thus , there were 66 separate ( u , v ) datasets with which to work , corresponding to 11 pointings each for the first four observing dates and all 22 pointings on the last ( refer to table [ tbl - points ] ) .",
    "the data for each pointing were imaged using the task imagr with a strong taper to produce an image 2 on a side , onto which was overlaid a `` flys - eye '' pattern of 37 slightly overlapping 512@xmath21512 square facets .",
    "the apparent positions of bright sources outside the coverage of the flys - eye were noted , and their true positions were taken from the first catalog @xcite . there were usually around ten such bright sources located outside the central flys - eye pattern . in subsequent imaging",
    ", all 37 facets of the flys - eye and all the bright sources outside of it were imaged separately using the 3d option of imagr .",
    "additionally , a few of the brightest sources within the flys - eye coverage were also given their own facets for imaging .",
    "each of the 66 ( u , v ) datasets were then subjected to iterative rounds of imaging and self calibration .",
    "after initially imaging the @xmath22 facets for a specific pointing , the imaged facets were inspected and sources were boxed for subsequent imaging rounds .",
    "the imaged facets were used as inputs for self calibration and additional editting of the ( u , v ) data .",
    "the end product was 66 well - behaved ( u , v ) datasets , and the three separate days of data per pointing were then combined to form the semi - final 22 ( u , v ) datasets ( i.e. , one per mosaic pointing ) .",
    "each of these were again subjected to imaging and self calibration , with the final images per pointing having sensitivities ranging from 39 to 45 @xmath1jy per 44 beam .",
    "the observational strategy ensured nearly identical ( u , v ) coverage for each pointing , resulting in circular 44 restoring beams for all pointings .",
    "we also performed quick tests of the relative performance of the retrofitted evla antennas .",
    "these were achieved by imaging the data for a given pointing both with and without the evla antennas included .",
    "the rms noise of the images which included the evla antennas was better by the expected amount under the assumption that they were identical to the standard vla antennas .",
    "we note that the main benefit of the retrofitted antennas at 1.4  ghz is their performance over wider bandwidths , which will be available for use when the evla s new correlator comes online .",
    "for the current project , we proceed treating the retrofitted evla antennas no differently than the regular vla ones .    the final image was created by assembling the mosaic of these 22 individual pointing images using the task flatn . for this mosaic ,",
    "two @xmath23 images with 1 pixels were created , centered on coma 1 and coma 3 ( 12@xmath1259@xmath13452 @xmath1427@xmath1557531 and 12@xmath1257@xmath13285 @xmath1427@xmath1508085 , respectively ) . only data out to the 30% power point of the vla 1.4  ghz primary beam were used , which corresponds to the central 19 facets of each flys - eye .",
    "data for each pointing were variance weighted according to the vla primary beam power pattern .",
    "the rms sensitivity of the final image is fairly uniform , as shown in figure [ fig - rmsconts ] which depicts contours of constant rms as evaluated over 5 square boxes centered on each location .",
    "the majority of the formal coma 1 and coma 3 areas have rms below 29 @xmath1jy ( figure [ fig - rmsarea ] ) , which correponds to a 5@xmath2 detection of a coma cluster galaxy forming stars at 0.1 m@xmath9  yr@xmath4 ( assuming the conversion of * ? ? ?",
    "the deepest regions within coma 1 have an rms sensitivity of 22 @xmath1jy , while those in coma 3 are slightly less sensitive ( figure [ fig - rmsarea ] ) .",
    "this is largely on account of the sidelobe response of the bright extended radio galaxies in the center of coma 1 ( ngc4874 and ngc4869 ) .      with varying sensitivity across the full mosaic image",
    ", we opted to create signal - to - noise ( @xmath24 ) maps for source detection .",
    "we first calculated the local rms for each pixel in the final mosaic images , evaluated over a 5 box using the task rmsd ( refer to figure [ fig - rmsconts ] ; smaller - sized boxes are overly effected by real extended sources such as ngc4869 ) .",
    "we then divided each mosaic image by its corresponding rms image to obtain the @xmath24 maps .",
    "source detection was then accomplished via the task sad , which was directed to identify sources with peaks greater than 4.5@xmath2 and fit them with gaussians .",
    "sad was run on six separate portions of the full mosaic images to insure that sources were not missed due to the task s limitations for the maximum number of sources it will evaluate in a given run .",
    "we also had sad create residual images , the purpose of which will be described shortly .",
    "the procedure is largely the same as that described in @xcite .",
    "the sad catalogs then served as input for creating the final catalog .",
    "each source in the sad catalogs was examined in the mosaic images ( not the @xmath24 image ) using the task jmfit , and its position , peak flux density , integral flux density and error , whether the source was resolved , and whether it was near the edge of the mosaic ( within @xmath025 , where the local rms measurement would be based on fewer resolution elements ) were recorded . repeated astrometric measurements with the vla at 1.4  ghz indicate a positional accuracy of around 01 for strong unresolved point sources .",
    "the fainter sources in our survey have positional errors on the order of 05 ( equation 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "because jmfit uses the noise measurement made over the full image when reporting flux density errors , we used the measured value at the source position in the rmsd map as the error in the peak flux density measurement .",
    "similarly , we updated the integral flux density errors by scaling the jmfit - reported values by the ratio of the local noise to the full mosaic area noise . assessing whether a source is resolved",
    "is not entirely straightforward due to the mosaic nature of the images .",
    "although greatly reduced by the smaller channels , bandwidth smearing does smear sources radially  and hence in different orientations for each pointing s contribution to a given source .",
    "thus , an intrinsically unresolved source might appear to be marginally resolved on account of bandwidth smearing arising in the individual pointings that contributed to that source within the mosaic .",
    "we call a source resolved if the minimum size of its reported major axis from jmfit was non - zero , however we note that there will exist false positives in the catalog .",
    "these are usually brighter sources , and can often be spotted through comparison of their peak and integral flux densities , which will be equivalent within their respective errors for unresolved sources .",
    "the residual images were then inspected to identify sources either missed or poorly fit by sad .",
    "this was greatly simplified by the procedure of having run source detection on the @xmath24 map , since contours at specific values of @xmath2 could be plotted and thereby render the identification of such sources easy .",
    "those sources missed by sad were added to the final catalog after repeating the procedure outlined in the preceding paragraph . because both sad and jmfit rely on gaussian fitting , plotted",
    "@xmath2 contours on the residual map also ease identification of sources for which fitting an individual gaussian was problematic . in such cases ,",
    "jmfit was used to deblend sources which were better described as multiple overlapping gaussians .",
    "finally , for the more irregularly shaped extended sources ( e.g. , ngc4869 ) the task tvstat was used to perform aperture photometry .",
    "the catalog positions for these sources correspond to the location of their peak flux density .",
    "the resulting radio source catalog is presented in table [ tbl - radiocat ] .",
    "there are over 1200 sources listed , although this figure includes lower significance detections and multiple entries for some sources which appear to be associated with a single extragalactic object ( e.g. , one entry for each lobe of a radio double ) .",
    "not all sources that were fit by multiple components by sad consist of multiple entries in table [ tbl - radiocat ] , however . in cases such as ngc4874 where we have prior knowledge of the source and its origin in a single radio galaxy we have included only a single entry in table [ tbl - radiocat ] .",
    "we have attempted to provide guidance for the possible multi - component sources by noting where our visual inspection of the images suggested a relationship between separate entries in the radio source catalog .",
    "this may be found in the `` comments '' field of table [ tbl - radiocat ] .",
    "the table includes sources down to @xmath25 , where @xmath24 is based on the peak flux density and error from the sad run on the @xmath24 map .",
    "although 5@xmath2 is traditionally used in radio surveys , we include sources with slightly lower significance .",
    "there are two reasons for this : first , they still have a very high chance of being non - spurious , especially in cases where they coincide with detected sources at other wavelengths .",
    "second , diffuse sources with peak flux densities less than five times the local noise might have integral flux densities greater than five times their integral flux density errors . restricting our acceptance criteria to sources with @xmath26 and within the 0.92 square degree contiguous area formed by the coma 1 and coma 3 fields",
    "yields 628 radio sources .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ? * ) included the photometry for coma in its data release 5 ( dr5 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the sdss observes the sky in drift - scan mode , using a novel multi - ccd camera @xcite that simultaneously collects data in five filters ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 ) .",
    "the median seeing at @xmath29 is 14 , and the 95% completeness limit for point source detection is 22.2 mag in this filter @xcite .",
    "the magnitudes are on the ab system @xcite and have uncertainties in the 0.02  0.03 mag range @xcite .",
    "catalog data are available online ( http://www.sdss.org/dr5/ ) and are described in the early data release paper @xcite . for correlation with the radio data , we used the sdss dr5 catalog of all objects within large boxes that extended @xmath32 past each side of the formal coma 1 and coma 3 regions .",
    "these included both photometrically - classified stars and galaxies .",
    "we adopted a matching radius of 2 for sources with @xmath33 and 1 for fainter sources .",
    "these figures were determined based on direct estimation using the data .",
    "first , table [ tbl - radiocat ] was correlated with the sdss optical catalog , and the sdss object nearest to each radio source was recorded . to evaluate",
    "whether a given radio - optical pair represented a real physical association , we repeated this correlation a number of times after having applied arbitrary fixed offsets to the radio catalog , thus arriving at estimates of the probability of chance superpositions derived directly from the data .",
    "the resulting distribution of radio - optical separations is shown in the top - left panel of figure [ fig - offsets ] .",
    "the large peak in the distribution of the unshifted data with small radio - optical separations is obvious , and the vast majority of such objects are real associations of radio emission with an optical source . at larger separations",
    "the two distributions are approximately the same , indicating that sources at such separations are consistent with expectations for random superposition of a radio source with an optical source .",
    "the false match rate appears higher than the actual data for most of the separations plotted in the top left panel of figure [ fig - offsets ] because the number of sources used in generating the shifted catalogs is conserved and the fraction of radio sources with real optical counterparts is high . in other words , if we were to remove the real counterparts and renormalize the unshifted data to have the same number of sources as the shifted data , the two curves would be more coincident .",
    "the two curves cross at a separation near 2 , indicating that radio sources with optical counterparts closer than this value have a high probability of being physically associated with one another while radio sources with more distant optical counterparts are likely false associations .",
    "the density of sources in the radio and optical catalogs is sufficiently high that at the larger plotted separations the number of matches declines .",
    "the use of the 1 search radius for fainter objects was determined in the same manner .",
    "figure [ fig - offsets ] also includes the real and offset catalog results for three separate magnitude ranges , @xmath34 ( top right ) , @xmath35 ( bottom left ) , and @xmath36 ( bottom right ) .",
    "it can be seen that for each of the @xmath34 and @xmath35 samples the distributions of the real data and the shifted data cross somewhere just below 3 .",
    "however , for the fainter sources ( @xmath36 ) the crossover is at separations less than 2 .",
    "figure [ fig - offsets ] also provides a direct way to estimate the confidence with which a given radio - optical association may be judged .",
    "for example , a pair with a 1 separation would have about a 1 in 40 chance of being a false association if the optical source had @xmath34 , about a 1 in 10 chance if @xmath35 , and about a 1 in 5 chance if @xmath36 .",
    "a comparison of the three panels also shows the expected result that the optically brighter galaxies are more likely to be associated with a radio source .",
    "the @xmath24 map that was used in the generation of the radio source catalog was then overlaid on the @xmath29-band images from the sdss .",
    "the entire area of the radio mosaic was thus inspected to identify apparent matches of radio emission with optical sources , guided by an input listing of all sdss sources with radio counterparts from table [ tbl - radiocat ] within 3 . as indicated , we generally accepted sources with radio - optical separations up to 2 for brighter objects",
    "( @xmath37 , or @xmath38 in coma ) but were more restrictive for fainter objects and used 1 separation as the cut . some sources with separations smaller than these values",
    "were rejected for a variety of reasons . in some cases , multiple sdss counterparts of a radio source existed and the radio emission was ascribed to the object that was deemed the more likely counterpart , with such a determination usually based on giving preference to the nearer counterpart with an sdss object type of galaxy .",
    "seventeen sources with separations greater than 2 were also accepted in cases where the radio emission was extended and its morphology was consistent with expectations based on the optical source .",
    "examples include spiral galaxies with extended radio emission matching their optical disks ( e.g. , ngc4911 ) and elliptical galaxies hosting `` fr1 '' and `` fr2 '' type radio sources ( e.g. , ngc4869 , ngc4874 ) .",
    "all of these exceptions are depicted in figure [ fig - extrads ] . finally , the visual inspection found four radio doubles where the midpoint of the two radio positions was within 1 of the apparent optical counterpart .",
    "the full radio - optical source catalog is presented in table [ tbl - radopt ] , and consists of 499 optical counterparts to radio sources from table [ tbl - radiocat ] . for completeness , we present the rejected optical sources within 3 of a radio source in table [ tbl - rejects ] along with brief explanations for their exclusion from table [ tbl - radopt ] .",
    "the table includes summary data for the sdss optical counterpart , including its photometric classification ( galaxy or star ) and @xmath39 `` model '' magnitudes .",
    "these are based on a common aperture defined by the more likely of a devaucouleurs or pure exponential profile fit to the data at @xmath29 band , and are the recommended magnitudes for color studies of galaxies ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "unless otherwise noted , in the ensuing discussion we restrict our analysis to the contiguous @xmath40 square degree area defined by the combined coma 1 and coma 3 fields ( see section [ sec - intro ] and figure [ fig - rmsconts ] ) and refer to this generically as the `` survey area . ''    about half of the radio sources within the survey area have optical counterparts in the sdss .",
    "of the 628 radio sources with @xmath41 , 312 have optical counterparts from the sdss catalog and an additional three optical counterparts to radio sources were found in our visual inspection of the radio data overlaid onto the sdss @xmath29-band images ( refer to table [ tbl - radopt ] ; the optical sources not found within the sdss catalog were presumably excluded due to their location near very bright objects such as diffraction spikes around saturated stars ) .",
    "a further 22 radio sources detected at less than 5@xmath2 were also identified with sdss optical counterparts within the survey area .",
    "conversely , the fraction of optical sources ( @xmath42 ) detected by the radio observations ( @xmath43 ) is shown in figure [ fig - magdist ] .",
    "specifically , we use the sdss objects with photometric classification as galaxies ) were removed from the optical catalog as inspection of the images indicated they were saturated stars mistakenly classified as galaxies . ] and investigate the fraction of sources with @xmath44 radio detections as a function of @xmath29 magnitude . at the brighter magnitudes ( @xmath45 , or @xmath46 for coma members ) , our survey detects over half of the galaxies ( 15/28 , including all six objects with @xmath47 ) .",
    "velocity measurements for the radio detections , including many new measurements for fainter galaxies determined from an mmt campaign using hectospec ( marzke et al . in preparation ) , are presented in @xcite where we derive and discuss the radio lf .",
    "we note here that ned contains measurements for most of the galaxies in the present discussion ( those with @xmath48 ) since coma has been the target of numerous galaxy spectroscopic surveys , including the sdss @xcite . assuming a redshift range 4,000 km  s@xmath4@xmath49 10,000 km  s@xmath4 for coma ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , all 15 of the radio detections with @xmath45 are found to be coma members .",
    "the radio detection fraction remains in about the 10% - 20% range for @xmath50 before dropping . at brighter optical magnitudes the radio sources are almost exclusively coma members , while at the fainter magnitudes they are predominantly background galaxies .",
    "by @xmath51 the radio - detected fraction falls to about 1% .",
    "the types of the radio - detected sources are elucidated by their optical colors .",
    "figure [ fig - cmd ] shows the optical color - magnitude diagram , with radio detections indicated by filled circles for cluster members , open circles for non - members , and open triangles for sources without velocity information .",
    "the red sequence is very clearly delineated , and we fitted it for galaxies with @xmath52 using the procedure of @xcite .",
    "note that this fitting is strictly based on photometric data , so some galaxies that lie on the red sequence will actually be non - cluster members whose colors happen to be consistent with the coma red sequence .",
    "it can be seen from figure [ fig - cmd ] that the radio detection fraction for red sequence galaxies rises at @xmath53 ( @xmath54 for coma ) . setting the red sequence range at @xmath55 about the fitted relation of @xmath56 , 18 of 43 red sequence galaxies with @xmath57 are radio detections . the detection rate increases with optical luminosity , as found in numerous other studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "all five red sequence galaxies having @xmath58 ( @xmath7 ) are detected by the radio data ( these include four of the five brightest cluster galaxies noted above ) .",
    "conversely , only two of the 135 red sequence galaxies with @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) are radio detections . based on velocities from the literature , one of the 18 radio detections among the brighter galaxies is a background source ( j12581169 + 2708117 with @xmath61 km  s@xmath4 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) along with one of the two radio - detected fainter galaxies ( j12581684 + 2710267 with @xmath62 km  s@xmath4 ; * ? ? ?",
    "this means that the faintest radio - detected coma member on the red sequence has @xmath63 , with the possible exception of j12591536 + 2746052 .",
    "@xcite report a velocity of 6315 km  s@xmath4 for this galaxy , although they indicate this determination is of intermediate quality as it is based on few spectral features .",
    "if true , it would have @xmath64 and @xmath65 w  hz@xmath4 , making it an extreme outlier about four magnitudes fainter than the next faintest coma radio - detected member .",
    "the detection fraction is similar for galaxies bluer than the red sequence . of the 66 galaxies with @xmath52 and ( @xmath66 ) colors at least @xmath67 bluer than the fitted red sequence , 25 are radio detections .",
    "most of the detections have @xmath68 , where 17 radio detections are found among 34 total galaxies . again",
    ", relying on published velocity measurements from ned and the sdss we find that 6 of the 25 radio - detected galaxies are background galaxies ( 2 of 17 for the @xmath68 detections ) .",
    "the faintest radio - detected coma member with a blue color has @xmath69 . presumably , the radio emission from these blue coma galaxies has its origins in star formation .",
    "this is largely confirmed via further analysis of photometric data and optical spectroscopy in @xcite , where only one blue coma galaxy showed spectroscopic evidence for an agn in the form of emission line diagnostics typical of a seyfert galaxy ( ark395 ) .",
    "its blue colors ( including uv ) extending across its disk suggest that star formation also contributes to the net radio emission from this galaxy . based on their respective radio and optical morphologies ,",
    "some of the blue coma galaxies appear to be undergoing ram pressure stripping .",
    "for example , figure [ fig - extrads ] includes ic4040 which has radio contours compressed to its northwest side and extended to the southeast  consistent with the h  i deficit and morphology reported in @xcite .",
    "this disturbed morphology produces an offset between the fitted radio position and the nucleus of the galaxy and hence its inclusion in figure [ fig - extrads ] .",
    "although it lies outside the coma 3 footprint , kug1255 + 283 ( also shown in figure [ fig - extrads ] ) has a similar radio morphology , in this case with its radio emission extended away from the galaxy in a direction roughly opposite that of the cluster center",
    ". other examples of known star - forming galaxies with radio contours suggestive of ram pressure interactions include markarian 57 and kug1258 + 279a with radio - optical positional offsets of 13 and 10 , respectively . again , in each case the radio contours are asymmetric with respect to the galaxy nucleus and extended in a direction roughly pointing away from the center of the cluster . both",
    "are included in the @xcite work , although markarian 57 is actually h  i rich .",
    "kug1258 + 279a is h  i deficient , although only weakly detected and hence its h  i morphology is only suggestive of ram pressure interaction @xcite .",
    "although this survey specifically addresses the coma cluster , its combination of sensitivity and areal coverage are comparable to some published deep fields .",
    "the total area covered within the combined coma 1 and coma 3 footprint is about 0.9 square degrees , with a typical rms sensitivity of 28 @xmath1jy per 44 beam ( refer to figures [ fig - rmsconts ] and [ fig - rmsarea ] ) .",
    "the vla - virmos deep field ( vvds ) includes radio observations with an rms sensitivity of 17 @xmath1jy per 6 beam across a 1 square degree region @xcite , and the subaru / xmm - newton deep field ( sxdf ) covers 0.8 square degrees with 20 @xmath1jy sensitivity at about 5 by 4 resolution ( note that these figures are specifically for the subset of the total area surveyed having local rms sensitivity below 20 @xmath1jy ; * ? ? ?",
    "along with the excellent multiwavelength data available for coma ( refer to section [ sec - intro ] ) including optical spectroscopy of galaxies down to fairly faint magnitudes ( @xmath70 ; marzke et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , the multi - waveband coma data will also be of value to deep field science .",
    "figure [ fig - src ] shows the source counts for our survey , and the source count data are provided in table [ tbl - src ] .",
    "we have restricted this analysis to the 628 sources within the coma 1 and coma 3 coverage area that were detected with a peak flux density greater than five times the local noise .",
    "in addition to source counts from the vvds and sxdf , we also plot those of the phoenix deep field ( pdf ; * ? ? ? * ) and the first survey .",
    "the wider area of these surveys improves the numbers and hence error bars for source counts at higher flux densities .",
    "we note that the source counts for the coma data have only been corrected for the areal coverage in each bin ( i.e. , sources in the fainter bins are detectable only in the deeper regions of the survey area ) , thus ignoring effects such as eddington bias and resolved sources with integral flux densities sufficient for inclusion but peak flux densities failing to reach the 5@xmath2 cutoff .",
    "even so , the source counts are consistent with these other studies , showing the usual decline in normalized counts between 100 mjy and 1 mjy , followed by leveling below 1 mjy .",
    "a slight excess of sources is seen in the @xmath71 to @xmath72 mjy region , and it is tempting to attribute this to coma member galaxies since these flux densities correspond to luminosities of a few times @xmath73 w  hz@xmath4 for galaxies at the distance of coma .",
    "while coma galaxies certainly do contribute to the source counts between @xmath71 to @xmath72 mjy , the excess over the first survey source counts in this region is much greater than can be explained by the presence of the coma cluster . for the source counts at approximately 1.5 mjy and 3 mjy in figure [ fig - src ] , the difference between the number of sources in the coma survey area and that expected based on the first source counts amounts to roughly 20 to 25 sources per each bin .",
    "the matching to sdss optical data and optical spectroscopic databases indicates that only nine coma members have radio flux densities falling in these bins ( three for the 1.5 mjy bin and six for the 3 mjy bin ) . the comprehensive optical spectroscopic coverage for radio - detected galaxies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) insures that we are not missing coma galaxies down to very faint optical magnitudes ( @xmath74 ) .",
