    "over the past few years it has been shown that a lepton asymmetry can be generated by the mixing of heavy majorana neutrinos .",
    "majorana neutrinos have the remarkable property of being mixed states of particles and antiparticles . by definition",
    "they induce @xmath0 and consequently @xmath1 transitions . in addition",
    "they could have couplings to scalar particles , which allow them to decay into higgs particles and leptons , i.e. @xmath2 @xcite . in these models",
    "@xmath3violation is introduced through complex couplings and appears in the self - energy @xcite or vertex corrections @xcite .",
    "we shall classify the effects using the terminology of @xmath4 mesons @xcite . we shall call direct or @xmath5type effects , the @xmath3violation which arises from the interference of tree diagrams with vertex corrections .",
    "similarly we call indirect or @xmath6type effects , those which arise through the self - energies . the self - energies play the role of the box diagram in the @xmath4 system and define the physical states",
    ". a consequence of the observation in @xcite is that the physical majorana states @xmath7 are not @xmath8 eigenstates and that the @xmath3asymmetries produce observable effects .",
    "finally , the mass splitting between the states also plays a role and when the mass difference is of the order of the width there is a resonance enhancement @xcite",
    ".    the processes under discussion must satisfy unitarity constraints so that the sum of the probabilities for all transitions to and from a state @xmath9 should sum to one and yields @xcite : @xmath10 for our case this means that when we consider the scatterings @xmath11 equation ( [ uni ] ) turns into @xmath12 so that the probabilities for the direct and inverse process should be equal . for the early universe a summation over all possible physical states with boltzmann factors weighting the inital states",
    "is required .",
    "boltzmann factors are introduced according to the thermal properties of the universe . at thermal equilibrium , for example , the weighting factors are all equal , which implies that the lepton asymmetry averages to zero @xcite .",
    "this issue and its implications are explicitly proved in @xcite and further discussed in @xcite .",
    "the generation of a lepton or baryon asymmetry is a combination of the sakharov effects @xcite ( i ) baryon or lepton violation , ( ii ) @xmath13 and @xmath3violation and ( iii ) the thermodynamic properties of the ensemble of particles in the early universe .",
    "for this reason several early papers studied the non - equilibrium equations of the ensemble @xcite .",
    "these thermal considerations together with several subtleties of the phenomenon are mentioned in @xcite . in this article",
    "we present an explicit calculation of the modification of the unitarity constraints as implied by the thermodynamics of the system and point out the meaning of the various terms .",
    "in fact we shall show that the s - channel physical poles play a special role and are responsible for the development of asymmetries .    to begin with we consider _ massive unstable particles _ which interact and decay . as the particles interact",
    "some of them occur in intermediate states .",
    "when the lifetimes of the particles are long relative to the interaction times , the intermediate states interact many times with the thermal bath . for this reason",
    "they should not be considered as virtual states , but as ensembles of particles with their own thermodynamic distributions .",
    "this phenomenon modifies the unitarity sum , i.e. the various terms in equation ( [ wei ] ) are weighted by different factors , and a lepton asymmetry is created .",
    "we estimate the collision of the particles in relation to their lifetimes . the width of the particles with energy @xmath14 and mass @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 their frequent interactions are like @xmath17 with a higgs particle exchanged in the t - channel .",
    "the cross - section at temperatures @xmath18 is @xmath19 we now calculate the interaction of one particle @xmath20 with a density of quarks . at a temperature @xmath21 and assuming boltzmann statistics the particle density is given by @xmath22 therefore the interaction rate for relativistic velocities is @xmath23 thus there are many more interactions per decay width @xmath24 or larger .",
    "since many scatterings are taking place during the lifetime of the particles , each state has a different history and the particle states are incoherent . at this epoch",
    "when we consider many scatterings , decays and recombinations of particles , there is no asymmetry , because the unitarity of the s - matrix guarantees the equality of direct and inverse processes .",
    "an asymmetry is generated when specific channels begin to decouple .",
    "as usual we work on an extension of the standard model where we include one heavy right - handed majorana field @xmath25 per generation of light - lepton @xmath26 the new fields are singlets with respect to the standard model @xcite .",
    "extensions of this model have been constructed in gauge theories @xcite , supersymmetric theories @xcite and theories with electroweak singlet neutrinos @xcite .",
    "we consider the contribution from the interference of the diagrams in figure 1 , which appears in the asymmetry of the reaction @xmath27 in the figure , we have indicated the momenta explicitly and have taken the absorptive part of the self - energy .",
    "in addition we consider many generations indicated by the indices @xmath28 and @xmath29 for the external particles , the index @xmath30 for the loop - momentum and @xmath31 and @xmath32 for the heavy particle propagators .",
    "the contribution to the asymmetry is @xmath33 with @xmath34 is the loop diagram and @xmath35 is the born diagram amplitude ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "carrying out the same calculation for the process @xmath36 we obtain the following expression for the asymmetry : @xmath37 in this expression we kept the propagator field for all intermediate states but omitted their widths .",
    "the two expressions are the same except for the factor of the coupling constants .",
    "a careful comparison of the two expressions shows that they become identical when we sum over the intermediate states and over all external particles .",
    "this can be seen by rearranging of the indices .",
    "it is a consequence of unitarity mentioned above .",
    "the same property persists when we keep all the masses of the propagators or when we replace the propagators with @xmath6functions in the narrow - width approximation .",
    "the two expressions @xmath38 and @xmath39 are different when we select specific components .",
    "this is in fact what happens in the development of the universe , as the temperature reaches the mass of a heavy neutrino specific components are multiplied by special boltzmann factors , which single them out as demonstrated below .",
    "in this section we explicitly discuss the thermodynamic development of the system . in this way",
    "we explain how deviations from thermal equilibrium modify the sum of unitary contributions and render them different from zero .",
    "the lepton asymmetry is a sum of several terms :    first , there are the decays of the heavy majorana neutrinos :    * @xmath40 which creates an excess of leptons , and * @xmath41 which reduces the amount of leptons    and the corresponding recombination terms . in addition",
    "there are two scattering processes :    * @xmath42 which creates an excess of leptons , and * @xmath43 which reduces the amount of leptons .",

    "the asymmetry is proportional to the sum of the self energy and the vertex contribution .",
    "we emphasize that at thermal equilibrium , the unitarity of the amplitudes implies the vanishing of the lepton asymmetry , as it is demonstrated in section 1 . on the other hand ,",
    "the thermal development of the majorana densities is the reason for the unitarity cancellation to become ineffective and allow the generation of the lepton asymmetry ( see section 2 ) .",
    "finally , we solve the boltzmann equations numerically and create a final asymmetry , which is proportional to the sum of the @xmath3parameters coming from the vertex contribution @xmath56 and from the self energy @xmath88 the latter one has a resonant behaviour depending on the mass difference of the majorana particles @xcite .",
