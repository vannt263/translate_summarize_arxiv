    "hartree - fock ( hf ) based random phase approximation ( rpa ) has been a very successful theory in providing microscopic description of phenomena associated with collective motion in nuclei @xcite .",
    "accurate information for important physical quantities can be obtained by comparing the experimentally deduced strength function distribution , @xmath1 , with the results obtained from hf - rpa theory . in particular , the strength function distributions of the isoscalar giant monopole resonance ( isgmr ) and the isoscalar giant dipole resonance ( isgdr ) are quite sensitive to the value of the nuclear matter incompressibility coefficient , @xmath5 , @xcite , a very important physical quantity since it is directly related to the curvature of the equation of state .    over the last two decades , a significant amount of experimental work was carried out to identify the strength distributions of the isoscalar giant resonances in nuclei , particularly the isgmr @xcite and isgdr @xcite .",
    "the main development in the area of experimental investigation of the isoscalar giant resonances is the high accuracy data , of excitation cross section , by @xmath6particle scattering , obtained at texas a&m university using a beam analysis system ( bas ) , a multipole - dipole - multipole ( mdm ) spectrometer and broad range multiwire proportional counter .",
    "the new system improved the signal to background ratio by more than a factor of 15 .",
    "this led to the discovery of a high lying structure in the strength function of the isgmr and the location of the isgmr in light nuclei .",
    "also , accurate data on the isgdr has been obtained for a wide range of nuclei @xcite .",
    "this has led to renewed interest in the nuclear response function and the need to carry out detailed and accurate calculations of @xmath1 and the transition density , @xmath7 , within the hf - rpa theory .",
    "in particular there have been quite a few recent hf - rpa@xcite and relativistic mean field ( rmf ) based rpa@xcite calculations of the isgdr , considering the issues of ( i ) spurious state mixing ( ssm ) , ( ii ) the strength of the lower component ( at 1@xmath8 ) and ( iii ) the value of @xmath5 deduced from the centroid energy @xmath9 of the isgdr compression mode ( at 3@xmath8 ) .",
    "comparison between the recent data on the isgmr and the results of hf based rpa calculations confirms the value of @xmath10 mev , determined earlier in @xcite .",
    "it was first pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that the hf - rpa results for @xmath9 , obtained with interactions adjusted to reproduce the isgmr data , are higher than the experimental values @xcite by more than 3  mev and thus this discrepancy between theory and experiment raises doubts concerning the unambiguous extraction of @xmath5 from energies of compression modes .",
    "this discrepancy between theory and experiment was also reported in more recent experiments @xcite .",
    "recently , shlomo and sanzhur@xcite have addressed this discrepancy by carrying out accurate microscopic calculations for @xmath1 and the excitation cross section @xmath11 of the isgdr , within the folding model ( fm ) distorted - wave - born - approximation ( dwba ) , with @xmath7 obtained from hf - rpa calculations and corrected for the ssm . they demonstrated that the calculated @xmath11 drops below the experimental sensitivity in the region of high excitation energy containing 30 - 40% of the isgdr energy weighted sum rule ( ewsr ) .",
    "this missing strength leads to a reduction of more than 3.0 mev in the value of @xmath9 and thus explains the discrepancy between theory and experiment .",
    "clearly accurate calculations of @xmath1 and @xmath11 are needed .",
    "in fully self - consistent hf - rpa calculations , the spurious isoscalar dipole ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) state ( associated with the center of mass motion ) appears at energy @xmath14 and no ssm in the isgdr occurs .",
    "it was pointed out in @xcite that none of the calculations carried out for @xmath1 and @xmath15 and published in the literature are fully self - consistent . in some rpa calculations the mean field and the particle - hole interaction @xmath16",
    "are chosen independently .",
    "although this approach can provide physical insight on the structure of giant resonances , it can not be used to accurately determine important physical quantity such as @xmath5 . in self - consistent hf - rpa calculation@xcite one",
    "starts by adopting specific effective nucleon - nucleon interaction , @xmath17 , such as the skyrme interaction , and carries out hf calculations .",
    "the parameters of the interaction are determined by a fit to properties of nuclei ( binding energies , radii , etc . ) .",
    "then one solves the rpa equation using the particle - hole ( p - h ) interaction @xmath16 which corresponds to @xmath17 .",
    "however , although not always stated in the literature , self - consistency is violated in actual implementations of the rpa ( and relativistic rpa ) calculations .",
    "one usually makes the following approximations : ( i ) use a @xmath16 which is not consistent with @xmath17 .",
    "it is common to neglect the two - body coulomb and spin - orbit interactions in @xmath16 and approximate the momentum dependent parts in @xmath16 , ( ii ) limiting the p - h space in a discretized calculation by a cut - off energy @xmath18 , and ( iii ) introducing a smearing parameter ( i.e. , a lorentzian with @xmath19 ) .",
    "the consequences of these violations of self - consistency on @xmath1 and @xmath15 and of numerical inaccuracy are usually ignored in the literature .    in this work we present results of detailed investigations of the consequences of common violations of self - consistency in actual implementations of hf based rpa , for determining the response functions @xmath1 and @xmath7 of isoscalar multipole ( l=0,1 and 2 ) giant resonances .",
    "in particular , we consider the isgdr and concentrate on the effects of the ssm .",
    "we determine the effects of a violation of self - consistency by comparing the calculated results for @xmath1and @xmath7 with those obtained from highly accurate fully self - consistent hf- continuum rpa ( hf@xmath0crpa ) calculations@xcite .",
    "we also extend the projection method for eliminating the effects of ssm , described in ref .",
    "@xcite , to properly normalize @xmath1 and @xmath7 and determine the mixing amplitude of the spurious state in the isgdr .    in section",
    "ii we present an extension of the green s function based derivation of the projection operator method for eliminating the effects of the ssm , described in @xcite , to also account for the proper normalization of the @xmath1 and @xmath20 of the isgdr and determine the mixing amplitude of the spurious state , obtained in hf - rpa calculations .",
    "we emphasize here that the method is quite general and applicable for any scattering operator @xmath21 and for any numerical method used in carrying out the rpa calculation , such as configuration space rpa , coordinate space ( continuum and discretized ) rpa and with and without the addition of smearing .",

    "we point out that comparing the total energy weighted transition strength with the ewsr may lead to incorrect conclusions . very recently",
    "the accuracy of the projection operator method in eliminating the effects of the ssm on @xmath1 and @xmath15 of the isgdr was investigated in refs .",

    "we thus conclude that since the values of @xmath153 are less than a few percent even with large violation of self - consistency , the renormalization of the strength function is not needed .",
    "we have considered the effects on the isgdr strength function when coulomb / spin - orbit interaction is switched on in the hf calculation , but , ignoring it in the particle - hole interaction .",
    "we find that when spin - orbit interaction is included , the strength function obtained using @xmath192 mev hardly gets affected at any energy and the differences can not be seen on the plots ( not shown here ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the nucleus in question , @xmath4 , is spin saturated , i.e. , the single - particle states with @xmath284 are occupied .",
    "however , this may not be the case for non spin - saturated heavy nuclei . when we carried out similar exercise with the coulomb interaction , the mean field changes significantly and we find that the strength functions gets shifted towards lower energy by about 2.0 mev .",
    "we note that , with the inclusion of coulomb interaction , the particle threshold for protons reduces from 15.33 mev to 3.5 mev .",
    "we have carried out self - consistent hf based crpa calculations for isoscalar giant resonances with multipolarities @xmath3 , 1 and 2 for @xmath4 nucleus as an example .",
    "we demonstrate that if a self - consistent calculation is performed using zero smearing width and a very fine radial mesh size ( @xmath285 fm ) , the spurious state occurs at @xmath286 mev and the isgdr response for the operators @xmath104 and @xmath287 are essentially the same for the energy @xmath288 which indicates no ssm and the corresponding ewsr is reproduced remarkably well .",
    "when we use @xmath289 fm in hf and crpa calculations , @xmath78 becomes about 0.7 mev and there exists a small ssm .",
    "the amplitude of this ssm ( i.e. , @xmath153 ) is @xmath290 , which is negligibly small and one need not renormalize the projected strength function . although the position of the spurious state is quite sensitive to the radial mesh size and smearing parameter @xmath190 , the centroid energy for the isoscalar resonances for @xmath291 , 1 and 2 do not change by more than @xmath198 .",
    "we have also performed the calculation for @xmath3 , 1 and 2 isoscalar resonances by discretizing the continuum using boxes of different sizes ( 12 and 72 fm ) with @xmath18 ranging from @xmath292 mev .",
    "we found that the strength distribution is fragmented over a wide energy range for the case of the smaller box irrespective of @xmath18 .",
    "for the case of discretization in a large box ( 72 fm ) with @xmath293 mev we find that the strength distribution agrees reasonably well with the corresponding one obtained from crpa , if a moderate value of the smearing parameter ( @xmath294 mev ) is used .",

    "the centroid energies for @xmath3 , 1 and 2 resonances converge to their corresponding exact values obtained from hf@xmath0crpa .",
    "this convergence is little slow in case of spurious state energy . for @xmath227 mev , the transition density @xmath159 at the spurious state energy obtained using discretized rpa differs from the corresponding crpa results ( which reproduce @xmath80 ) .",
    "however , with increase of @xmath297 to 200 mev , drpa results for the spurious state transition density @xmath159 become quite close to the crpa results .",
    "we also point out that one should use @xmath298 mev in order to calculate the centroid energies of the isoscalar @xmath3 , 1 and 2 resonances with the accuracy of 0.1 mev , comparable to the experimental uncertainties .",
    "we have demonstrated that the spurious state mixing due to the non - zero smearing width and a choice of a coarse sized radial mesh can be accurately eliminated using the projection operator @xmath129 .",
    "furthermore , we show that the ssm due to a small value of @xmath18 used in the drpa calculation can be fully eliminated by applying the projection method .",
    "we have investigated the consequences of violation of self - consistency on the @xmath1 and @xmath15 of the isoscalar @xmath3,1 and 2 giant resonances by varying the parameter @xmath234 by @xmath239 and @xmath240 in the patrticle - hole interaction .",
    "we find that if the self - consistency is not maintained then the values of @xmath78 and centroid energies for the @xmath3 , 1 and 2 isoscalar resonances are significantly different compared with their self - consistent values . even if the particle - hole interaction is renormalized to shift @xmath78 close to its self - consistent value , the centroid energies for @xmath3 and 1 resonances could not be corrected .",
    "this is due to the fact that though the renormalization corrects the value of @xmath78 , the nuclear matter incompressibility coefficient , @xmath236 associated with the particle - hole interaction is quite different than the one with the mean - field .",
    "however , the @xmath299 resonance is not very sensitive to the self - consistency violation as long as the particle - hole interaction is renormalized to shift @xmath78 close to its self - consistent value .",
    "it is also important to point out that the violation of self - consistency causes a significant redistribution of the transition strength .",
    "in particular , energy weighted transition strength of the lower energy component ( @xmath300 mev ) of the isgdr response function may differ by @xmath301 .",
    "the values of the ssm probabilities @xmath153 were found to be less than @xmath189 .",
    "therefore , one can neglect the renormalization of the isgdr strength function obtained using projection operator @xmath129 .",
    "further , we found that the total energy weighted transition strength for the operator @xmath287 remains unaltered even with the violation of self - consistency .",
    "calculations were also carried out by changing the parameters appearing in the particle - hole interaction in such a way that the nuclear matter incompressibility coefficient associated with it remains unaltered .",
    "we find that though the incompressibility coefficient associated with the particle - hole and the mean field are kept the same , due to the lack of self - consistency , the centroid energy for @xmath3 and 1 isoscalar resonances are off by @xmath246 and @xmath247 , respectively , compared to their self - consistent values .",
    "we may remark that if the isgmr centroid energy is determined with accuracy of @xmath246 , the value of @xmath5 deduced from a comparison with experimental data is then accurate within only @xmath249 .",
