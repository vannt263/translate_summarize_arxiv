    "polluted white dwarfs ( typed with a suffix `` z '' ) provide an opportunity to investigate the ultimate fate of planetary systems .",
    "although planets have not yet been detected around white dwarfs , the evidence for the presence of planetary debris around these objects lies in their polluted atmospheres .",
    "approximately one quarter of white dwarfs show the presence of elements heavier than helium in their atmospheres @xcite and approximately one fifth of these have a mid - infrared ( ir ) excess that is consistent with a circumstellar , debris disc @xcite . more recently using the cosmic origins spectrograph on the _ hubble space telescope _ @xcite have shown that about half of da white dwarfs with effective temperatures ranging from 17000 k to 27000 k have polluted atmospheres .",
    "several detailed studies of polluted white dwarfs have uncovered large variations in the composition of the accreted material . based on a study of ultraviolet ( uv ) spectra of a sample of white dwarfs ( 19000 < @xmath0 k )",
    ", @xcite showed that the abundance diversity in the accreted material is similar to that observed among solar system meteorites , although the effect of selective radiative radiation pressure on accretion rate calculations was neglected .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that selective radiation pressure on trace elements , silicon for instance , shapes observed abundance patterns in hot white dwarfs ( @xmath1 k ) . after including this effect in their calculations ,",
    "@xcite concluded that at least 27% of their white dwarf sample , which includes the @xcite sample , would be currently accreting , while in 29% of these objects , usually among the warmest in their sample , the effect of radiative levitation dominates the abundance pattern .",
    "the inclusion of this effect also leads to a reduction in the estimated accretion flow in some objects with @xmath2 k ( e.g. , wd0431 + 126 ) .",
    "an analysis of uv and optical spectra of two additional white dwarfs by @xcite show the accreting source to be of a rocky nature where the abundance of refractory elements is enhanced compared to volatile elements .",
    "also , @xcite showed that the cool , hydrogen - rich and magnetic white dwarf nltt  43806 ( typed dazh ) is enriched in aluminium but poor in iron which suggests that the accreting material is similar to the earth lithosphere .",
    "oxygen has been detected in several white dwarfs ( e.g. , galex  j1931 + 0117 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and , in some of these objects , the amount of oxygen with respect to the other heavier elements detected suggests that the accreted material contains significant amount of water .",
    "for example , in gd  61 @xcite found that the accreted material contains oxygen in excess of the amount expected to be carried by metal oxides , suggesting that the parent material contained water . a similar",
    "finding , but with a higher fraction of water , was found in the case of sdss  j124231.07@xmath3522626.6 @xcite .",
    "the material accreted at the surface of a white dwarf is subjected to diffusion processes : trace elements are quickly mixed in the convective envelope of cool white dwarfs , and diffuse - out below the convection zone in a period of time much shorter than evolutionary timescales @xcite .",
    "recent estimates @xcite of diffusion timescales show that relics of an accretion event remain visible in the photosphere of a cool ( 6000  k ) hydrogen - rich white dwarf for nearly @xmath4 years and much longer ( several @xmath5 years ) for cool helium - rich white dwarfs . however , the observed abundance would follow details of the accretion history , and the presence of heavy elements is likely transitory when compared to the cooling age of old white dwarfs ( @xmath6 years ) .",
    "we present a spectroscopic and photometric analysis of an hitherto unknown cool , polluted white dwarf ( nltt  19868 ) from the revised nltt catalogue of @xcite .",
    "we provide details of the new observations in section 2 : we obtained new low- and high - dispersion spectra as well as new and archival photometric measurements allowing to build a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) . in section 3 ,",
    "we analyse our new data and derive atmospheric parameters : temperature , surface gravity , and composition .",
    "next , in section 4 , we attempt to reconstruct recent accretion history onto this object .",
    "then , we draw a comparison with the sample of cool white dwarfs highlighting the peculiar photospheric composition of the cool white dwarf nltt  19868 , and , finally , we summarize our results .",
    "we present detailed spectroscopic and photometric observations of the newly identified white dwarf nltt  19868 .",
    "we first observed nltt  19868 with the eso faint object spectrograph and camera ( efosc2 ) attached to the new technology telescope ( ntt ) at la silla observatory on ut 2009 march 3 . using grism number 11 ( 300 lines / mm ) with the slit - width set to 1 arcsec",
    ", we obtained a resolution of @xmath7  .",
    "the two consecutive spectra of 1800 s each revealed a cool daz white dwarf with strong h&k lines .",
    "we followed up on our initial observations with four sets of echelle spectra of using the x - shooter spectrograph @xcite attached to the ut3 at paranal observatory on ut 2014 may 1 , 29 and june 1 .",
    "the slit - width was set to 0.5 , 0.9 and 0.6 arcsec for the uvb , vis and nir arms , respectively .",
    "this setup provided a resolving power of 9900 , 7450 and 7780 for the uvb , vis and nir arms , respectively .",
    "the exposure times for the uvb and vis arms were 2940 and 3000 s , respectively , and for the nir arm we obtained five exposures of 600 s each .",
    "we used the acquisition images from the efosc2 and x - shooter observations to obtain estimates of @xmath8 and @xmath9 magnitudes of nltt  19868 , respectively .",
    "first , we measured the instrumental magnitudes of nltt  19868 and of a brighter comparison star ( ra[j2000]=08h 36 m 03.44s , dec[j2000]=@xmath101005525 ) with published photometry ( @xmath11 mag ,  @xmath12 mag ,   @xmath13 mag , and @xmath14 mag ) from the aavso photometric all - sky survey ( apass ) .",
    "apass is an all - sky survey conducted in five filters ( johnson @xmath15 and @xmath9 , and sloan @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) with a magnitude range from approximately 10 up to 17 .",
    "we converted the sloan @xmath17 magnitude to the johnson @xmath8 magnitude using the transformation equations of lupton ( 2005):[multiblock footnote omitted ] @xmath19 or @xmath20 we calculated @xmath8 using both equations and used the average of the two measurements ( @xmath21 mag ) . finally , using the difference between the instrumental magnitudes of nltt  19868 and the comparison star , we calculated @xmath22 mag and @xmath23 mag for nltt  19868 .",
    "note that the uncertainties for @xmath9 and @xmath8 are statistical only and neglect any possible systematic effects .",
    "we obtained ir photometric measurements from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; * ? ? ? * ) and _ _ w__ide - field infrared survey explorer ( _ wise _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "the measurements which are all on the vega system are listed in table  [ tbl_phot ] .",

    "the amount of contamination is unknown since the spectral type of the nearby star is unknown , although its sed shows it to be a cool object ( @xmath29k ) .",
    "we have examined the 2mass images which show that nltt  19868 and the nearby object are clearly separated , and we conclude that the 2mass photometric measurements of nltt  19868 are not contaminated by the nearby star .",

    "abundance studies of cool , hence old white dwarfs allow to determine the frequency of planetary debris at an advanced cooling age , i.e. , long after the parent star left the main - sequence .",
    "also , because of the longer diffusion timescales predicted in cool white dwarfs , diffusion effects may become more apparent , particularly following a discrete accretion event . in this case , a spread of diffusion timescales within a group of elements would lead to time - dependent alteration to abundance ratios allowing for a critical examination of the physical conditions at the base of the convection zone ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the number of cool daz white dwarfs remains low compared to the number of their hot daz counterparts , or to the helium - rich dz white dwarfs .",
    "concentrating our efforts on the hydrogen - rich sample may help establish whether their environment is similar to the more common dzs . in this context ,",
    "our analysis of the cool daz white dwarf nltt  19868 and similar objects is timely .",
    "nltt  19868 lies among the coolest known daz white dwarfs . only three other daz white dwarfs",
    "have temperatures below 5500 k : g174 - 14 ( @xmath31 k , @xcite ) , nltt  10480 ( @xmath32 k , @xcite ) and g77 - 50 ( @xmath33 k , @xcite ) .",
    "the effective temperature adopted for g77 - 50 is the weighted average of the two measurements from @xcite and @xcite .    fig .",
    "[ fig_ratio ] ( top panel ) plots the calcium abundance of all known cool daz white dwarfs with temperatures lower than 7000  k. the effective temperature for seven of these objects were updated with the results of @xcite .",
    "the calcium abundance varies by several orders of magnitudes , consistent with other studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this range of abundances is possibly a result of large variations in the accreted mass and of a possible time lapse since the last accretion event resulting in a diffusion - induced decline in the observed abundance .",
    "[ fig_ratio ] ( bottom panel ) also shows the fe / ca abundance ratio for stars with a measurable iron abundance . even though the sample is small , a large dispersion ( @xmath34 ) in the fe / ca abundance ratio is observed .    within the small sample of objects depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_ratio ] , @xmath35 averages @xmath36 , which is lower than the bulk - earth abundance ratio of @xmath37 @xcite but is still consistent given the @xmath38 of the sample .",
    "we compared our cool sample to the larger sample of 50 polluted white dwarfs presented by @xcite which includes white dwarfs with @xmath39 k to @xmath40 k. our cool sample has a slightly smaller average but a larger dispersion than what is observed in the @xcite sample which has an average of @xmath41 and a @xmath42 .",
    "the likely reason for the difference in the dispersion is that in the hotter sample the dispersion is smaller than in the cooler sample and hence bringing down the dispersion in the @xcite sample .",
    "hence , the extrema at @xmath43 ( nltt  888 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and @xmath44 ( nltt  19868 ) are notable .",
    "the abundance ratio observed in the nltt  888 is only second to that of the cool dz white dwarf sdss  j1043 + 3516 ( @xmath45 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) while fe / ca in nltt  19868 is slightly lower than in the cool daz nltt  43806 ( @xmath46 , * ? ? ?",
    "the observed abundance ratio @xmath47 in nltt  19868 is also the lowest known among known polluted white dwarfs , underlining the low relative abundance of fe with respect to the other detected elements .",
    "this abundance ratio is slightly lower than that of nltt  43806 ( @xmath48=-0.2 , * ? ? ?",
    ". finally , the abundance ratio @xmath49 is among the lowest in polluted white dwarf atmospheres , in fact it is the second lowest after the heavily polluted dbaz gd  362 ( @xmath50 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a comparison with the population of the 60 polluted white dwarfs showing mg @xcite , for which the average is @xmath51 with a dispersion of 0.4 , clearly places nltt  19868 at the magnesium - deficient end of the distribution .        diffusion at the bottom of the convection zone alters the observed abundance pattern over a time period much shorter than cooling timescales",
    ". elements with short diffusion timescales relative to other elements are depleted faster and observed abundance ratios must vary over time . in a regime of steady state accretion ,",
    "the hypothetical z1/z2 abundance ratio is simply given by @xmath52 while in the declining phase , i.e. , after mass accretion ceased , the time ( @xmath53 ) dependent abundance ratio is given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 are the diffusion timescales at the bottom of the convection zone which is assumed to be homogeneously mixed .",
    "unfortunately , diffusion timescales are uncertain .",
    "few calculations are available for objects with effective temperatures below 6000  k. the abundance pattern in the accreted material @xmath56 is also uncertain and may , for example , correspond to solar ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , bulk , core , or mantle earth @xcite .",
    "other types of material , based on an analogy with solar system bodies such as those of meteorites or asteroids can also be considered .    a study of the fe / ca abundance ratio in the extreme cases of nltt  888 ( @xmath57  k ) and nltt  19868 ( @xmath58",
    "k ) and of applicable scenarios supports intrinsic abundance variations in the accreted material with likely alterations brought upon by diffusion effects .",
    "the observed fe / ca ratio is 58 in nltt  888 and 0.59 in nltt  19868 . in both cases , steady - state accretion regime does not significantly alter the observed ratio relative to the parent material ratio .",
    "first , we examine the case of nltt  888 .",
    "interpolating the tables of @xcite between 5000 and 6000  k , we find @xmath59 and the abundance ratio in both media are nearly identical .",
    "using timescales from @xcite , @xmath60 , leads to the same conclusion .",
    "therefore , the estimated ratio in the accreted material fe / ca @xmath61 largely exceeds that of bulk- ( @xmath6213.4 ) or mantle - earth ( @xmath621.8 ) suggesting that the accreted material in nltt  888 consists of 66% core material and 34% mantle using mass fractions converted to numbers fractions for these various media from @xcite and @xcite . considering that the fe / ca abundance ratio is likely to decrease over a diffusion time scale ( @xmath63 years ) in the eventuality that accretion is turned off , the inferred fraction of core material found in the parent body of the accreted material of nltt  888 must be considered a lower limit .",
    "the predominance of core iron material implies the likely presence of the , yet undetected , core elements such as nickel and sulfur @xcite . a significant amount of silicon ( 6% by mass , * ?",
    "* ) is also predicted to be present in the core , although if both core and mantle are to be accreted , most of the silicon would come from the mantle . among the larger population of polluted white dwarfs ,",
    "including higher temperature stars , such as in the sample of @xcite iron - enrichment is also observed , for example , when compared to silicon , both pg  0843@xmath3516 and pg  1015@xmath3161 accrete material where the fe / si ratio is comparable to the core earth . however , a comparison of the fe / ca ratio for stars in their sample , galex  1931@xmath30117 is the one with the highest fe / ca ratio @xcite and is only slightly lower than that of nltt  888 .",
    "scenarios for nltt  19868 suggest that , on the contrary , core - type material is largely absent and that the accreted material is most likely composed of mantle - type material .",
    "assuming steady - state accretion , the low iron content in the atmosphere implies a similar deficiency in the parent material , i.e. , significantly lower than the earth s mantle composition .",
    "such a deficiency of iron in the parent material , i.e. , below that of the earth s mantle , may not be necessary .",
    "the observed fe / ca abundance ratio is well reproduced if the accretion of earth s mantle like material turned off @xmath64 years ago , allowing to further reduce the fe / ca abundance ratio in the convection zone to the observed level .",
    "note that diffusion timescales tabulated by @xcite are systematically longer than those tabulated by @xcite by up to a factor of three .",
    "the difference arises because the convection zone reaches deeper in envelope models used by @xcite where diffusion would operate in a denser medium .",
    "the depth of the convection zone at low temperatures ( @xmath65  k ) is not affected by the various treatments of the mixing length theory but , instead by different treatments of the equation - of - state and of the conductive opacity @xcite .",
    "interpolating the tables of @xcite and @xcite between 5000 and 6000  k , we find @xmath66 and 0.96 , respectively .",
    "assuming mantle composition in the source , the original fe / ca ratio of 1.8 would be reduced to the observed ratio of 0.59 in @xmath67 years following @xcite or a much longer time of @xmath68 years following @xcite . a longer elapsed time implied by the calculations of @xcite",
    "requires an unrealistically large accretion event ( @xmath69 ) . using the shorter elapsed time implied by the calculations of @xcite results we can calculate an initial iron abundance of fe / h @xmath70 using : @xmath71 where the elapsed time since the accretion event is @xmath72 years and",
    "the diffusion timescale is @xmath73 years .",
    "assuming that the mass of the convection zone is @xmath74 and @xmath75 @xcite , then @xmath76  g , and the total mass of iron accreted onto the white dwarf is @xmath77  g , or , assuming an iron mass fraction of 6% in the mantle , the original accretion event would have weighed @xmath78  g. this mass corresponds to less than one thousandth of the mass of the earth ( @xmath79 ) . the same diffusion scenario , but employing earth bulk material characterized by a higher fe / ca abundance ratio than in the mantle , would require a larger settling time scale ( elapsed time @xmath80 years ) to match the low , present - day fe / ca abundance ratio .",
    "assuming an accretion event as large as the convection zone itself , even calcium would have disappeared below the detection limit ( @xmath81 ) after @xmath80 years .    in summary , we have identified a new cool , polluted white dwarf showing strong lines of calcium among weaker lines of magnesium , aluminium , and iron .",
    "our model atmosphere analysis revealed the lowest iron to calcium abundance ratio of any cool polluted white dwarf . applying heavy element diffusion models",
    ", we found that the accretion event involving another peculiar daz white dwarf , nltt  888 , and that involving nltt  19868 are clearly distinguishable .",
    "the material accreted into the surface of nltt  888 is composed mainly of the iron - rich planetary core material , while the material accreted onto the surface of nltt  19868 is more akin to earth mantle material . in the case of nltt  19868",
    ", the accretion event most likely occurred several diffusion timescales ago .",
    "although these scenarios appear reliable , details of the calculations rest upon uncertain diffusion timescale calculations .",
