    "future device technology and quantum information processing may be based on spintronics @xcite , where one manipulates the electron s spin ( and not only its charge ) . here",
    "we address attempts to build mesoscopic spin filters ( or spin valves ) , which generate a tunable spin - polarized current out of unpolarized electron sources .",
    "much recent effort in this direction uses narrow - gap semiconductor heterostructures , where the spins are subject to the rashba @xcite spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) : in a two - dimensional electron gas confined by an asymmetric potential well , the strength of this soi can be varied by an electric field perpendicular to the plane in which the electrons move @xcite .",
    "an early proposal of a spin field - effect transistor @xcite used the rashba soi to control the spin precession of electrons moving in quasi - one - dimensional wires .",
    "some of the most striking quantum effects arise due to interference , which is best demonstrated in quantum networks containing loops . indeed ,",
    "interference due to the rashba soi has been measured on a nanolithographically - defined square loop array @xcite .",
    "recently , several theoretical groups proposed spin filters based on a _ single _ loop , subject to both an electric and a magnetic ( aharonov - bohm ( ab ) @xcite ) perpendicular fields ( e.g refs .",
    "however , such devices produce a full polarization of the outgoing electrons only for _ special values _ of the two fields .",
    "later work considered the effects of the rashba soi on the conductance of chains of loops . these included studies of chains of diamond - like loops @xcite , and studies of finite chains of circular loops @xcite .",
    "although both studies showed some destructive interference due to the soi , they did not concentrate on the tuning of the fully polarized spins which can be obtained in certain parameter ranges .",
    "recently @xcite , we proposed a spin filter based on a periodic chain of diamond - like square loops , connected to each other at opposite corners [ see fig . [ 1 ] ] . unlike the above earlier papers , which used a continuum description for the wires on the network , we used a simple tight - binding model , with quantum dots ( or ` atoms ' ) only at the nodes of the square diamonds .",
    "this allowed us to obtain transparent analytical expressions for the ballistic conductance through the chain and for the outgoing spin polarization .",
    "we found that a combination of both the rashba soi and the ab flux through each loop can result in destructive interference , which can block the transmission of all the spin components except one , which is then polarized at a tunable direction .",
    "technically , this single spin direction is associated with a single propagating wave solution of the schrdinger equation , while all the other solutions involve evanescent modes .    here",
    "we extend our analysis of this diamond - like chain in several directions .",
    "first , we replace the previous square loops by rhombi , with a general angle @xmath0 ( fig . [ 1 ] ) .",
    "it turns out that the filter is more efficient for @xmath1 .",
    "second , we generalize our previous study , by allowing different site energies ( controlled by appropriate gate voltages ) on the various sites in the unit cell ( i.e. sites @xmath2 and @xmath3 in fig .",
    "[ 1 ] ) . different site energies at sites @xmath4 and @xmath3 turn out to have drastic effects on the ballistic conductance .",
    "third , we propose using this filter at fixed electric and magnetic fields , controlling the outgoing polarization using a gate voltage .",
    "( in ref . @xcite we worked at fixed energy , and varied the magnetic and electric fields . )",
    "fourth , we replace each edge of each rhombus by a tight - binding chain of ` atoms ' ( or quantum dots ) . in this context",
    ", we compare our tight - binding approach with the continuous quantum network approach used in earlier work on the same geometry @xcite . as we discuss elsewhere @xcite , the two approaches are not equivalent .",
    "section 2 outlines the tight - binding model which we use for solving the schrdinger equation on the periodic chain of generalized diamonds .",
    "section 3 presents results for the polarization of the electrons in the regions where they are fully polarized .",
    "we compare our tight - binding approach to earlier continuum network models in sec . 4 , and summarize our results in sec . 5",
    "the basic theory was presented in ref .",
    "however , for the generalizations introduced here we find it easier to use the ( rotated ) coordinate axes shown in fig .",
    "[ 1 ] . setting the opening angle of each diamond to @xmath0 , the coordinates of the sites in the @xmath5th unit cell become @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the basic step along the @xmath9axis .",
    "we start with the simplest tight - binding model , which has ` atomic ' sites only at the corners of the diamonds ( this will be extended below ) .",
    "the hopping @xmath10 unitary matrices within the @xmath5th diamond thus become @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the site @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the vector of pauli matrices , @xmath15 ( @xmath16 represents the strength of the rashba term ) , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the number of flux units through each diamond . for each bond , the hopping matrix",
    "must be multiplied by the hopping energy , @xmath20 ( below we measure all energies in units of @xmath21 ) .    within the @xmath5th diamond ,",
