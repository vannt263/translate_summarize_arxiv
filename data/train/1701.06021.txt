    "this is an alternative method to compute material parameters other than transformation optics , and circumvents the trail - and - error way to guess parameters .",
    "we emphasise that our theory is a general approach to design material profiles for non - reflective electromagnetic waves , and should be extendable to vectorial , three - dimensional case despite the mathematical complication . for simplicity of illustration , we restrain our investigation in this paper to two - dimensional case with linear polarisations  @xcite .",
    "the merit of the analysis applied here lies in its simplicity to design the material profile without resorting to numerics .",
    "a remark to note is that our designed profiles of material are real - valued , which surprisingly support reflection - less waves for certain incident waves .",
    "this contrasts with the complex profiles that work for a single angle of incidence   with @xmath0 at infinity and plugging this into the wave equation of no source  , one reads off the corresponding permittivity . ] .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follow .",
    "the methodology for designing material profiles to achieve predefined amplitude or phase will be given in sec .",
    "the example material profiles in this paper are designed for two types of wave solutions : 1 ) a spatial - modulating wave from a point source ( sec .",
