    "the study of graphs embedded in @xmath1 is a natural extension of knot theory .",
    "however , the motivation for the field came from the use of topology to understand the symmetries of non - rigid molecules .",
    "while the symmetries of most molecules can be represented by their isometries in @xmath3 , large molecules have greater flexibility and hence some of their symmetries may be the result of homeomorphisms that can not be achieved by isometries . for large molecules ,",
    "different colored edges can be used to represent different types of molecular chains or different types of bonds ( see for example the representation of a molecular mbius ladder in @xcite ) .",
    "thus results about topological symmetries of colored graphs embedded in @xmath3 have potential applications to the study of molecular symmetries of large molecules .",
    "for example , liang and mislow @xcite used colored edges to distinguish molecular chains in their proof that certain families of proteins are chiral ( i.e. , topologically distinct from their mirror images ) . after observing that these proteins all contain the same embedding of the complete graph @xmath4 or the complete bipartite graph @xmath5 in @xmath3 , liang and mislow @xcite showed that by coloring some edges of the embedded @xmath4 and @xmath5 black and other edges grey they become topologically distinct from their mirror image .",
    "they conjectured that their black and grey graphs would remain topologically distinct from their mirror images even if they were embedded differently in @xmath3 .",
    "flapan and li @xcite proved that in fact the edges of any non - planar graph can be colored black and grey in such a way that every embedding of the graph in @xmath3 is topologically distinct from its mirror image .",
    "furthermore they showed that , with the exception of the graphs @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the edges of any non - planar graph can be colored black and grey so that no embedding of the graph in @xmath3 has any color preserving homeomorphisms .",
    "since the underlying abstract graphs of most molecules are planar , it seems useful to extend the above results to planar graphs . in particular",
    ", we would like to characterize those planar graphs whose edges can be 2-colored so that all of their embeddings in 2 or 3-dimensional space are asymmetric .    in order to make our results precise , we begin with some definitions .",
    "we use the term _ abstract graph _ to refer to any finite connected set of vertices and edges such that every edge has two distinct vertices and there is at most one edge between a given pair of vertices .",
    "2-coloring _ of an abstract graph is an assignment of one of the words  black \" or  grey \" to each edge of the graph .",
    "a _ color preserving automorphism _ of a graph @xmath6 is an automorphism of the graph taking grey edges to grey edges and black edges to black edges .",

    "a 2-coloring of an abstract graph @xmath6 is said to be _ intrinsically asymmetric _ in a space @xmath8 if for any embedding @xmath7 of @xmath6 in @xmath8 every color preserving homeomorphism of @xmath10 restricts to the trivial automorphism of @xmath7 .",
    "a 2-coloring of an abstract graph @xmath6 is said to be _ intrinsically chiral _ in @xmath8 if no embedding @xmath7 of @xmath6 in @xmath8 has a color preserving orientation reversing homeomorphism of @xmath9 .",
    "we use the word _",
    "intrinsic _ in this context to emphasize that the asymmetry or `` chirality '' depends only on the 2-coloring of the abstract graph @xmath6 and the space @xmath8 and not on the particular embedding of @xmath6 in @xmath8 .",
    "note that a 2-colored graph is intrinsically asymmetric ( or intrinsically chiral ) in @xmath3 if and only if it is intrinsically asymmetric ( or intrinsically chiral ) in @xmath1 . however , symmetries are often easier to work with in @xmath1 than in @xmath3 . using the above terminology , flapan and li proved the following :    @xcite [ flapli ] _ a non - planar 3-connected graph has a 2-coloring which is intrinsically asymmetric in @xmath1 if and only if the graph is neither @xmath5 nor @xmath4 . furthermore , every non - planar graph has a 2-coloring which is intrinsically chiral in @xmath1 .",
    "_    observe that for planar graphs , regardless of how the edges are colored , a planar embedding of the graph in @xmath1 will have a color preserving reflection through the plane containing the graph .",
    "such a reflection restricts to the trivial automorphism of the graph , and hence tells us nothing about symmetries of the graph in @xmath1 .",
    "hence we consider only those orientation reversing homeomorphisms of @xmath1 that restrict to a non - trivial automorphism of the embedded graph .",
    "in particular , we say that a 2-coloring of a graph @xmath6 is _ intrinsically faithfully chiral _ in a space @xmath8 if for any embedding @xmath7 of @xmath6 in @xmath8 , every color preserving orientation reversing homeomorphism of @xmath9 restricts to the trivial automorphism on @xmath7 . in section 2 , we prove the following :    [ 3-conn ] a 3-connected planar graph has an intrinsically asymmetric 2-coloring in @xmath1 if and only if the graph is not @xmath0 .",

    "a _ path _ in a graph is a non - self - intersecting connected sequence of edges .",

    "observe that @xmath16 is a single edge , @xmath17 is a path of 2 edges , and @xmath18 is a path consisting of at least 3 edges . in section 3 , we prove the following :    [ planar ] a planar graph has an intrinsically asymmetric 2-coloring in @xmath2 if and only if the graph is not a single vertex , a triangle , a square , a pentagon , @xmath0 , @xmath19 , @xmath13 with @xmath20 , or @xmath11 with @xmath12 and @xmath14 both odd and not @xmath21 .",

    "the distinction between considering homeomorphisms of embedded graphs and automorphisms of abstract graphs is highlighted by the observation that every complete graph @xmath23 has distinguishing number @xmath12 , whereas it follows from the non - planar graph theorem that for all @xmath24 , @xmath23 has an intrinsically asymmetric 2-coloring in @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , relatively few automorphisms of @xmath23 are the restriction of a homeomorphism of @xmath25 for some embedding @xmath7 of @xmath23 in @xmath1 .",
    "see @xcite for a characterization of which automorphisms of @xmath23 can be induced by a homeomorphism of @xmath25 for some embedding @xmath7 .    the distinction between coloring the vertices and the edges of a graph is also relevant .",
    "for example , the graph consisting of a single edge is 2-distinguishable , yet no matter how the edge is colored and embedded in @xmath1 there will be a homeomorphism of @xmath1 which restricts to a non - trivial color preserving automorphism of the graph . on the other hand , for a given graph @xmath6 , one can define the _ line graph _",
