    "does not apply any more , and the quantum mechanical generalization of thermodynamics becomes necessary .",
    "the interplay between thermodynamics and quantum physics has been an interesting research topic since 1950s @xcite . in recent years , with the developments of nanotechnology and quantum information processing , the study of the interface between quantum physics and thermodynamics begins to attract more and more attention @xcite .",

    "a central concern is to make quantum mechanical extension of classical thermodynamic processes and cycles @xcite .",
    "it is well know that in classical thermodynamics there are four basic thermodynamic processes : adiabatic process , isothermal processes , isochoric process , and isobaric process @xcite .",
    "these four processes correspond to constant entropy , constant temperature , constant volume , and constant pressure , respectively . from these four basic thermodynamic processes",
    ", we can construct all kinds of thermodynamic cycles , such as carnot cycle , otto cycle , brayton cycle , et al @xcite .",
    "among all the four kinds of basic thermodynamic processes , adiabatic process has been extended to quantum domain , and has been extensively studied ever since the born of quantum mechanics .",
    "nevertheless no attention was paid to the quantum mechanical generalization of the remaining three basic thermodynamic processes until most recently . in a recent paper @xcite , along with our collaborators , we systematically study the quantum mechanical generalization of the isothermal and the isochoric process .",

    "meanwhile in recent years , numerous studies on other quantum thermodynamic cycles are also reported @xcite .",
    "however , as to our best knowledge , the quantum mechanical generalization of isobaric process ( constant pressure ) has not been studied systematically so far .",
    "possibly the lack of the consideration of quantum isobaric process is due to the fact that  pressure \" ( force ) @xcite is not a well defined observable in a quantum mechanical system .",

    "it is easy to see that the entropy ( 11 ) and the internal energy ( 12 ) of a single mode radiation field have different forms from that of 1db ( 9),(10 ) , and thus from the classical ideal gas .",
    "the internal energy ( 12 ) of single mode radiation field depends on both the temperature @xmath53 and the width @xmath23 of the potential well , while the internal energy of 1db ( 10 ) depends on @xmath53 only .",
    "in addition , the equation of state ( 7 ) of the single - mode radiation field differs from from that ( 5 ) of 1db , and thus from the classical ideal gas .",
    "based on these observations , we say that the single mode radiation field has totally different thermodynamic properties from that of classical ideal gas . it can be inferred that quantum heat engine based on single mode radiation field can give us new results beyond that of classical ideal gas . as we mentioned before , the hamiltonian of the single - mode radiation field is the same as that of 1dh .",
    "thus all the results about single mode radiation field are the same as that for 1dh .",
    "alternatively , we can say that 1dh is the counterpart of single - mode photon gas , in analogy to the fact that 1db is the counterpart of classical ideal gas .",
