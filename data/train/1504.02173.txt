    "although it is nonintegrable @xcite , and the behavior of electron - impact ionization of hydrogenic atoms near the breakup threshold has been treated long time @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the dynamics above the threshold , the classical motion below the threshold is no longer regular ; the classical phase space consists of not only reguar but also chaotic parts @xcite .",
    "the chaotic dynamics below the threshold produces infinitely many resonances in photoelectron spectra of two - electron atoms , and the fluctuating parts of the spectra owing to the resonances show a series of seemingly meaningless irregular signals @xcite .",

    "a study was conducted of classical dynamics of positron - hydrogen scattering for wide range of energies including below as well as above the threshold @xcite . however , in that work , the classical mechanics was merely used as a calculational method for monte carlo simulations rather than being analyzed for the purpose of characterization of the resonance structures as was done in two - electron atoms .",

    "initial conditions evolve with time and pass through the sos .",
    "a set of initial conditions at their first passage through the sos forms an initial line segment in the sos .",
    "and then the initial line segment proceeds in sos by the poincare map . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , we show images of two initial line segments obtained by applying the poincare map several times . the segment a is the image of initial line segment formed from the interval @xmath46 $ ] which includes the initial condition @xmath47 corresponding to the dip with the widest wings in fig .",

    "[ fig5](a ) that both the the line segments a and b are cut by the stable manifold of tripl collision .",
    "however , looking into the partition of sos by symbol sequences of length 7 , we can find the number of intersection points of the segment b and the stable manifold of triple collision increases as the partition gets finer as in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) .",
    "this is consistent with the feature of the scattering time signals such that there are infinitely many dips in in the interval @xmath45 $ ] .    from studies of three - body problems",
    ", it has been generally known that trajectories in captured state can exit to uncaptured state along only the orbits falling in triple collision ; the closer the trajectory gets to triple collision , the larger the escaping velocity of the trajectory gets @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the farther the trajectory gets from triple collision , the smaller the escaping velocity gets .",
    "this means that orbits with initial conditions far from dips , i.e. very close to the ends of wings escape the three - body interaction zone with zero energy of relative motion between the hydrogen atom ( positronium ) and electron ( proton ) .",
    "thus the ends of the wings rise infinitely , producing peaks in scattering time signals as was mentioned in sec .",
    "in addition to the role of triple collision as an exit from captured state , the other prominent role of triple collision is led by time - reversal symmetry of the present system as follow : scattering trajectories can enter into captured state along only the orbits starting from triple collision @xcite .",
    "thus , in semiclassical physics , resonances in scattering cross sections can be described in terms of contributions from ctcos , i.e. closed orbits starting and ending in the triple collision @xcite .",
    "it can be easily seen that all ctcos lies in the collinear configuration , and thus the present study of classical mechanics of collinear @xmath0 system is relevant to the fluctuations in the scattering cross sections in the real 3-dimensional space .",
    "therefore , as was done for two - electron atoms @xcite , significant predictions can be made on the total scattering cross section of positron by the hydrogen atom with the total energies approaching the three - body breakup threshold from below as follows : ( 1 ) fluctuation in the cross section as a function of the total energy would be chaotic , ( 2 ) the amplitude of the fluctuation decays algebraically as the energy approaches the three - body breakup threshold , and ( 3 ) the fourier transform of the fluctuation would show distinct peaks at the position of the actions of ctcos .",
    "the statement ( 1 ) comes from the chaotic nature of the symbolic dynamics of the system : between any two ordinary admissible symbol sequences , we can find arbitrarily long symbol sequences with ending in triple collision .",
    "the statement ( 2 ) comes from the fact that the instabilities of relevant part of ctcos approach to infinity as the energy approaches the breakup threshold , which is related to the irregularizability of the triple collision @xcite .",
    "the exponent for algebraic decay is determined by the stability of the relevant part of ctcos , which will be obtained in future work . finally , the statement ( 3 ) is based on closed orbit theory @xcite , which is a general theory for atomic photoabsorption cross sections . however , the condition required in the theory is nothing but the restriction on the starting and ending point of the leading orbits to captured state : both the starting and ending point should be close to the center of atomic system .",
    "thus it can be applied to scattering cross sections for the systems with ctcos .",
    "the action values and relative instabilities of ctcos are not calculated in the present paper , remaining as a future work .",
    "however , we can predicted that there are no peaks in fourier transform of the fluctuation which correspond to the forbidden symbol sequences c112c , c122c , c221c , c211c , etc .",
    "this is quite important characteristics different from two - electron atoms , reflecting the phase space structure of the present system .        looking into the partition of sos",
    ", we get doubt if there are some islands around the point @xmath48 in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . in order to lift obscurity ,",
    "we draw a phase portrait around that point . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , there is actually an island of stability consisting of tori in the chaotic sea . at the center of the island which is indicated by an arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , there is a stable periodic orbit , which is found to be the shortest one with infinite symbol sequence @xmath49 ; all orbits in the island is represented by the same symbol sequence .",
    "this is another characteristics different from two - electron atoms of which collinear eze subspace is known to be fully chaotic @xcite . since it has been accepted that there is no bound state of positron - hydrogen system in the real 3-dimensional world @xcite , the stability of the tori in the direction orthogonal to the collinear subspace should be investigated for semiclassical prediction of existence or absence of bound or long - lived states . and",
    "it will be also a good subject of future study to understand effects of the tori through dynamical tunneing in the scattering cross sections @xcite .    for complete study of positron - hydrogen system in future",
    ", we should mention on a scattering channel which is excluded in the present work , i.e. positron - electron annihilation .",
    "it is well known that the possible contribution of the positron - electron annihilation to the total scattering cross section is negligible except in the limit of zero positron energy @xcite .",
    "however , it may be necessary to consider positron - electron annihilation for total energies just below the three - body breakup threshold since the amplitude of fluctuating part in the total cross section would decay to zero as the total energy approaches the breakup threhold and thus would be affected even by small perturbations owing to the annihilation channel .",
    "the classical dynamics of positron scattering by the hydrogen atom in the collinear configurational subspace was studied for total energies below the three - body breakup threshold .",
    "a systematic analysis of the phase space structure of the system was given for the first time , resulting in important new findings : ( 1 ) the system shows chaotic scattering , ( 2 ) the topological structure of the phase space is invariant under exchange of the dynamical variables of proton with those of positron , ( 3 ) there is a finite set of forbidden patterns of symbol sequences such as 1122 , 2211 , 11211 , 22122 , ( 4 ) there are tori forming a stable island around the shortest periodic orbit . and ,",
    "based on the phase space structure and well - known general dynamics near triple ollision.we explained main features of scattering time signals .    using the relevance of ctcos to fluctuations in scattering cross sections owing to resonances , quantum manifestations of the classical dynamics",
    "were predicted on the total scattering cross section such that ( 1 ) fluctuation in the cross section as a function of the total energy would be chaotic , ( 2 ) the amplitude of the fluctuation decays algebraically as the energy approaches the three - body breakup threshold , and ( 3 ) the fourier transform of the fluctuation would reflect the phase space structure through absence of peaks represented by the symbol sequences c112c , c122c , c221c , c211c , etc .",
    "including the forbidden symbol sequences .",
    "this work is considered as a first step to full understanding of classical , semiclassical and quantum dynamics of positron - hydrogen system , and we suggested several subjects to be done in future .",
    "in addition , it would be a kind of challenge to find a quantum mechanical menifestation of the structural invariance of the phase space under exchange of the dynamical variables of proton with those of positron .",
