    "the qualitative influence of quenched disorder at second - order phase transitions is well understood since harris proposed a relevance criterion  @xcite based on the knowledge of the specific heat critical exponent @xmath0 of the pure model : when @xmath0 is positive , the disordered system will reach a new fixed point with new critical exponents whereas if @xmath0 is negative , the same universality class will persist .    as a paradigmatic model ,",
    "the three - dimensional ( 3d ) disordered ising model characterized by @xmath1 has been extensively studied by :    @xmath2 renormalization group methods in the weak quenched dilution regime .",
    "the best estimates for the critical exponents obtained by this method are  @xcite :    @xmath3    @xmath4    @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath2 monte carlo simulations of the site - diluted case for which the following exponents have been found  @xcite :    @xmath6    @xmath7    @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath2 experimental investigations .    for a review of these different results , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the general picture which is now widely accepted is that , starting from the pure ising model ( with exponents @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the critical temperature decreases and eventually vanishes at the percolation threshold below which there is no longer any long - range order in the system , due to the absence of percolating clusters . in the dilution - temperature plane ,",
    "the critical line @xmath12 which delimits ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases has two end - points ( namely the pure system and the percolation point ) described by unstable fixed points and it is commonly believed that the quenched disordered system has universal properties described by a unique stable fixed point . according to this picture , the competition between fixed points possibly leads to an effective variation of universal critical quantities .    in this paper",
    ", we first determine the phase diagram of the bond - diluted problem ( up to now , only the site - diluted case has been studied ) and compare it to a prediction in the single - bond effective - medium approximation and then we try to illustrate the competition between fixed points leading to crossover regimes in some physical quantities .",
    "the bond - diluted ising model is defined by the following hamiltonian with independent quenched random interactions :",
    "@xmath13    the coupling strengths are allowed to take two different values @xmath14 and @xmath15 with probabilities @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively ,    @xmath18    @xmath19 being the concentration of missing bonds , which play the role of the non - magnetic impurities .",
    "the simulation technique is based on the swendsen - wang cluster algorithm with periodic boundary conditions in the three space directions .",
    "the phase diagram is obtained numerically from the maxima of a diverging quantity ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . here",
    "we choose the susceptibility , since the stability of the disordered fixed point implies that the specific - heat exponent is negative in the random system .",
    "thus , the error in this quantity is larger than for the susceptibility .",
    "the percolation threshold is located at @xmath20 .",
    "= 5.5 cm    [ fig1 ]    = 6.3 cm    to get an accurate determination of the maxima of the susceptibility , we used the histogram reweighting technique with @xmath21 monte carlo sweeps ( mcs ) and between @xmath21 and @xmath22 samples of disorder .",
    "the number of monte carlo sweeps is justified by the increasing behaviour of the energy autocorrelation time and we chose for each size at least @xmath23 independent measurements of the physical quantities @xmath24 .    for a second - order phase transition , the autocorrelation time",
    "is expected to behave as @xmath25 at the critical point where @xmath26 is the dynamical critical exponent ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . for the disordered ising model",
    ", we get the values of @xmath26 shown in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "we see that the critical slowing down weakens for the disordered model and becomes smaller when the concentration of magnetic bonds @xmath16 decreases , but it is necessary to increase the number of disorder realisations when @xmath16 decreases because of the vicinity of the percolation threshold .",
    ".the dynamical critical exponent @xmath26 as obtained from linear fits of @xmath27 vs @xmath28 .",
    "[ tab1 ] [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     = 5.5 cm    [ fig3 ]    the phase diagram obtained from the location of the maxima of the susceptibility for the largest lattice size as a function of the concentration of magnetic bonds is shown in fig .",
    "the simple mean - field transition temperature is drawn for comparison : it gives a linear behaviour as a function of the bond concentration @xmath16 and we can check that this approximation holds only in the low - dilution regime , @xmath29 . on the other hand , the effective - medium approximation  @xcite gives very good agreement with the simulated transition line . treating only a single bond in an effective medium leads to the following relation for the critical coupling : @xmath30 this relation is exact in the vicinity of both the pure system and the percolation threshold .",
    "the main problem encountered in previous studies of the disordered ising model was the question of measuring effective or asymptotic exponents .",
    "although the change of universality class should happen theoretically for an arbitrarily low disorder , it can be very difficult to measure the new critical exponents because the asymptotic behaviour can not always be reached practically .",
    "another difficulty comes from the vicinity of the ratios @xmath31 and @xmath32 in the pure and disordered universality classes .",
    "indeed , these values for the pure model are @xcite : @xmath33 and for the disordered ising model @xcite : @xmath34    thus , from standard finite - size scaling techniques , the critical exponent @xmath35 only will allow us to discriminate between the two fixed points .",
    "this exponent can be evaluated from the finite - size scaling of the derivative of the magnetisation versus the temperature which is expected to behave as @xmath36 . from this power - law behaviour , we have extracted the effective size - dependent exponent @xmath37 which is plotted against @xmath38 for different bond concentrations @xmath16 in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] where @xmath39 is the smallest lattice size used in the fits .",
    "we clearly see that in the regime of low dilution ( @xmath16 close to @xmath40 ) , the system is influenced by the pure fixed point . on the other hand ,",
    "when the bond concentration is small , the vicinity of the percolation fixed point induces a decrease of @xmath41 below its expected disordered value .",
    "indeed , the percolation fixed point is characterized by @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "we have presented , from a numerical study , the influence of bond dilution on the critical properties of the 3d ising model .",
    "the universality class of the disordered model is modified by disorder but its precise characterization is difficult because of the competition between the different fixed points which induce crossover effects , even for relatively large lattice sizes .",
    "the next step is to accurately locate the best dilution which minimizes these crossover effects .",
