    "black phosphorous is a two - dimensional material with an orthorhombic lattice - structure with lattice vectors @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and four basis atoms arranged in a puckered structure ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lat ] ) .",
    "the bond vectors have approximately equal length @xmath186  , and intra- and inter - pucker angles @xmath187 and @xmath188 @xcite .",
    "hence , the bond vectors read            according to the vfm put forward in ref .",
    "( see also ref .  )",
    "the elastic energy of the unit cell is given by @xmath199 where @xmath200 is the relative bond - length change and @xmath201 with @xmath202 is the bond angle change due to the deformation up to first order in strain and @xmath4 .",
    "there are nine force - field parameters , namely , @xmath203 , @xmath204 , @xmath205 , @xmath206 , @xmath207 , @xmath208 , @xmath209 and @xmath210 .",
    "those determine the energy cost for bond stretching , angle bending , bond - bond and bond - angle correlations .",
    "the expressions for the bond vectors , eqs .   and , render the energy @xmath211 , eq . , to be a quadratic function in the components of the strain tensor and the components of @xmath4 .",
    "by minimizing @xmath211 with respect to @xmath212 , @xmath213 and @xmath214 and dividing by the area of the unit cell , @xmath215 , we obtain the deformation energy - density @xmath216 .",
    "for the vfm parameters reported in ref .   we find @xmath217 these expressions , together with eqs .  , constitute the strain - displacement relations for phosphorene .",
    "having the deformation energy - density @xmath218 one can calculate the elastic constants @xmath219 , which are given by@xcite @xmath220 where @xmath221 and @xmath222 , @xmath223 and @xmath224 . from those",
    "one derives young s and shear moduli , @xmath225 and @xmath226 , and the poisson ratios @xmath227 , @xmath228 moreover , the sound velocities are given by@xcite @xmath229 where @xmath230 is the 2d mass density of phosphorene .",
    "the results we calculate for all those elastic properties are summarized in tab .",
    "[ tab : el_res ] .",
    "we also provide results for the case where the correction @xmath4 is not taken into account . comparing the sound velocities to the values given in ref .",
    "one readily concludes that is necessary to account for @xmath4 to get comparable results .",
    "one may also compare the young s moduli to recent dft results from various groups .",
    "there the values of the reported young s moduli are for instance : @xmath233 n / m and @xmath234 n / m @xcite , @xmath235 n / m and @xmath236 n / m @xcite , @xmath237",
    "n / m and @xmath238 n / m @xcite .",
    "again the values in tab .",
    "[ tab : el_res ] for the corrected case match best .",
    "qualitatively , the vfm reported in ref .",
    "gives very good results .",
    "however , it should also be mentioned that it has some deficits .",
    "for example , the poisson ratios are obtained as @xmath239 and @xmath240 , whereas other studies report @xmath241@xcite or @xmath242@xcite .",
    "however , it should be kept in mind that the parameters of the vfm were found by fitting to optical @xmath243-phonons measured in an experiment . to get a better quantitative description more",
    "data is required and the poisson ratios need to be included in the fitting procedure .",
    "as argued in the main text , the strain - displacement relations are very important for correctly estimating the influence of strain on the electronic structure .",
    "to demonstrate this for phosphorene , we follow ref .   where a two - orbital tight - binding model was used to calculate the electronic band - gap of phosphorene .",
    "the band - gap energy is then given by @xmath244 where @xmath245 , @xmath246 and @xmath247 are the hopping parameters between atoms @xmath248 and @xmath249 , @xmath248 and @xmath250 and @xmath248 and @xmath251 , respectively .",
    "for the undeformed lattice the values are @xmath252 ev and @xmath253 ev . assuming a distance dependence of the hopping parameters as @xmath254 , in accordance with the nature of the orbitals responsible for the relevant electronic bands , allows it to calculate the strain - induced modification of the band - gap @xmath255 .",
    "to this end we use the strain - displacement relations , eq .   and , for the respective bond - lengths .",
    "we obtain @xmath256 for comparison , in ref .",
    "the band - gap modification @xmath257 was obtained by transforming all bond - vectors using the strain tensor only .",
    "similar to the case of graphene , one obtains a non - negligible renormalization due to the non - bravais nature of the lattice .",
