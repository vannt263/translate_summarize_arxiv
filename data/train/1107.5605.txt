    "the modelling and control of quantum linear systems is an important emerging application area which is motivated by the fact that quantum mechanical features emerge as the systems being controlled approach sub - nanometer scales and as the required levels of accuracy in control and estimation approach quantum noise limits . in recent years",
    ", there has been considerable interest in the feedback control and modeling of linear quantum systems ; e.g. , see @xcite .",
    "such linear quantum systems commonly arise in the area of quantum optics ; e.g. , see @xcite . the feedback control of quantum optical systems has applications in areas such as quantum communications , quantum teleportation , and gravity wave detection . in particular , the papers @xcite have been concerned with a class of linear quantum systems in which the system can be defined in terms of a set of linear quantum stochastic differential equations ( qsdes ) expressed purely in terms of annihilation operators .",
    "such linear quantum systems correspond to optical systems made up of passive optical components such as optical cavities , beam - splitters , and phase shifters .",
    "the main results of this paper apply to this class of linear quantum systems for the square case in which the number of outputs is equal to the number of inputs .",
    "this paper is concerned with the use of singular perturbation approximations in order to obtain reduced dimension models for the class of linear quantum systems under consideration .",
    "singular perturbation approximations are is widely used for obtaining reduced dimension models for classical systems ; e.g. , see @xcite . in the case of quantum systems ,",
    "a reduced dimension model may be desired for a quantum plant to be controlled in order to simplify the controller design process which can be very complicated using existing quantum controller design methods such as the quantum lqg method of @xcite .",
    "another application of model reduction for linear quantum systems arises in the case of controller reduction where a reduced dimension controller is obtained from a high order synthesized controller . in the case of coherent quantum control such as considered in @xcite ,",
    "the controller is required to be a quantum system itself and thus the reduced dimension system must be physically realizable .    in the physics literature , a commonly used technique in the modeling of quantum systems is the method of adiabatic elimination , which is closely connected to the singular perturbation method in linear systems theory ; e.g , see @xcite .",
    "the papers @xcite also consider the issue of convergence of these singular perturbation approximations . in this paper , we consider the properties of the singular perturbation approximation to a linear quantum system from a linear systems point of view ; e.g. , see @xcite for a detailed description of singular perturbation methods in linear systems theory including error characterization in both the time and frequency domains . in particular , we are concerned with the physical realizability properties of the singular perturbation approximation to a linear quantum system .",
    "the issue of physical realizability for linear quantum systems was considered in the papers @xcite .",
    "this notion relates to whether a given qsde model represents a physical quantum system which obeys the laws of quantum mechanics . in particular , the results of the papers @xcite show that the notion of physical realizability enables a direct connection between results in quantum linear systems theory and linear systems theory . in applying singular perturbation methods to obtain approximate models of quantum systems , it is important that model obtained is a physically realizable quantum system so that it retains the essential features of a quantum system . also , if the approximate model of a quantum plant is to be used for controller synthesis , the controller synthesis procedure may need to exploit the physical realizability of the plant model . in addition , if model order reduction is applied to a coherent feedback controller which is to be implemented as a quantum system , then this reduced order controller model must be physically realizable . in the paper @xcite , the notion of physical realizability is shown to be equivalent to the lossless bounded real property for the class of square linear quantum systems under consideration .",
    "this property requires that the system matrix is hurwitz and that the system transfer function is unitary for all frequencies .",
    "the main result of this paper shows that if a singularly perturbed linear quantum system is physically realizable for all values of the singular perturbation parameter , then the corresponding reduced dimension approximate system has the property that all of its poles are in the closed left half of the complex plane and its transfer function is unitary for all frequencies .",
    "these properties indicate that in all but pathological cases , the singular perturbation approximation method will yield a physically realizable reduced dimension system .",
    "in addition , an example is given showing one such pathological system in which the singular perturbation approximation is not strictly hurwitz .",
    "the paper also presents a result for a special case of the singularly perturbed linear quantum systems considered in this paper .",
    "this special case corresponds to singular perturbations which arise physically from a perturbation in the system hamiltonian . in this case",
    ", the result shows that the corresponding reduced dimension approximate system is always physically realizable .",
    "this result can in fact be derived from the nonlinear quantum system results presented in the papers @xcite .",
    "however , we have included this result , along with a straightforward proof , for the sake of completeness .",
    "we have also included an example of a singularly perturbed linear quantum optical system which fits into the subclass of singularly perturbed quantum systems for which this result applies .",
    "this example illustrates how such singularly perturbed quantum systems can arise naturally in physical quantum optical systems .",
    "the remainder of this paper proceeds as follows . in section [ sec : systems ] , we define the class of linear quantum systems under consideration and recall some preliminary results on the physical realizability of such systems . in section [ sec : sing_pert ] , we consider the singular perturbation approximation to a linear quantum system .",
    "we first present a result for the class of singularly perturbed linear quantum systems under consideration which relates to the lossless bounded real property .",
    "we then consider a special class of singular perturbations which is related to corresponding perturbations of the quantum system coupling operator and hamiltonian operator .",
    "we present a result which relates to this class of singular perturbations and shows that the corresponding approximate reduced dimension system is guaranteed to be physically realizable . in section [ sec : example ] , we present a simple example from the field of quantum optics to illustrate the proposed theory . in section [ sec : conclusions ] , we present some conclusions .",
