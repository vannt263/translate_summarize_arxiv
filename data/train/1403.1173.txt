    "in this paper we consider a minimal metapopulation model with two competing populations .",
    "it consists of two different environments among which migrations are allowed .    as migrations do occur indeed in nature , @xcite ,",
    "the metapopulation tool has been proposed to study populations living in fragmented habitats , @xcite .",
    "one of its most important results is the fact that a population can survive at the global level , while becoming locally extinct , @xcite .",
    "an earlier , related concept , is the one of population assembly , @xcite , to account for heterogeneous environments containing distinct community compositions , providing insights into issues such as biodiversity and conservation . as a result , sequential slow invasion and extinction shape successive",
    "species mixes into a persistent configuration , impenetrable by other species , @xcite , while , with faster invasions , communities change their compositions and each species has a chance to survive .",
    "a specific example in nature for our competition situation for instance is provided by _ strix occidentalis _ , which competes with , and ofter succumbs to , the larger great horned owl , _",
    "bubo virginianus_. the two in fact compete for resources , since they share several prey , @xcite .",
    "if the environment in which they live gets fragmented , the competition can not be analysed classically , and the metapopulation concept becomes essential to describe the natural interactions .",
    "this paper attempts the development of such an issue in this framework .",
    "note that another recent contribution in the context of patchy environments considers also a transmissible disease affecting the populations , thereby introducing the concept of metaecoepidemic models , @xcite .    an interesting competition metapopulation model with immediate patch occupancy by the strongest population and incorporating",
    "patch dynamics has been proposed and investigated in @xcite .",
    "patches are created and destroyed dynamically at different rates .",
    "a completely different approach is instead taken for instance in @xcite , where different competition models , including facilitation , inhibition and tolerance , are investigated by means of cellular automata .",
    "the model we study bears close resemblance with a former model recently appeared in the literature , @xcite . however , there are two basic distinctions , in the formulation and in the analysis . as for the model formulation , in @xcite",
    "the populations are assumed to be similar species competing for an implicit resource .",
    "thus there is a unique carrying capacity for both of them in each patch in which they reside .",
    "furthermore their reproduction rates are the same .",
    "we remove both these assumptions , by allowing in each patch different carrying capacities for each population , as well different reproduction rates .",
    "methodologically , the approach used in @xcite uses the aggregation method , thereby reducing the system of four differential equations to a two - dimensional one , by assuming that migrations occur at a different , faster , timescale than the life processes .",
    "this may or may not be the case in real life situations .",
    "in fact , referring to the herbivores inhabiting the african savannas , this movement occurs throughout the lifetime , while intermingling for them does not constitute a `` social '' problem , other than the standard intraspecific competition for the resources , @xcite .",
    "the herbivores wander in search of new pastures , and the predators follow them .",
    "this behavior might instead also be influenced by the presence of predators in the surrounding areas , @xcite .",
    "thus the structure of african herbivores and the savanna ecosystems may very well be in fact shaped by predators behavior .    in the current classical literature in this context",
    ", it is commonly assumed that migrations of competing populations in a patchy environment lead to the situation in which the superior competitor replaces the inferior one .",
    "in addition , it is allowed for an inferior competitor to invade an empty patch , but the invasion is generally prevented by the presence of a superior competitor in the patch , @xcite .",
    "based on this setting , models investigating the proportions of patches occupied by the superior and inferior competitors have been set up , @xcite .",
    "the effect of patch removal in this context is analysed in @xcite , coexistence is considered in @xcite , habitat disruptions in a realisting setting are instead studied in @xcite .",
    "note that in this context , the migrations are always assumed to be bidirectional .",
    "our interest here differs a bit , since we want to consider also human artifacts or natural events that fragment the landscape , and therefore we will examine particular subsystems in which migrations occur only in one direction , or are forbidden for one of the species , due to some environmental constraints .    our analysis shows two interesting results .",
    "first of all , a kind of competitive exclusion principle for metapopulation systems also holds in suitable conditions .",
    "further , the competitive exclusion principle at the local patch level may be overcome by the migration phenomenon , i.e. two competing populations may coexist , provided that either only one of them is allowed to freely move , or that migrations for both populations occur just in one and the same direction .",
    "this shows that the assumptions of the classical literature of patchy environments may at times not hold , and this remark might open up new lines of investigations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we formulate the model showing the boundedness of its trajectories .",
    "we proceed then to examine a few special cases , before studying the complete model : in section [ one ] only one population is allowed to migrate , in section [ direc ] the migrations occur only in one direction . then the full model is considered in the following section .",
    "a final discussion concludes the paper .",
    "we consider two environments among which two competing populations can migrate , denoted by @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , their sizes in the two environments . here",
    "the subscripts denote the environments in which they live .",
    "let each population thrive in each environment according to logistic growth , with possibly differing reproduction rates , respectively @xmath5 for @xmath2 and @xmath6 for @xmath3 , and carrying capacities , respectively again @xmath7 for @xmath2 and @xmath8 for @xmath3 .",
    "the latter are assumed to be different since they may indeed be influenced by the environment .",
    "further let @xmath9 denote the interspecific competition rate for @xmath2 due to the presence of the population @xmath3 and @xmath10 denote conversely the interspecific competition rate for @xmath3 due to the presence of the population @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath11 the migration rate from environment @xmath12 to environment @xmath13 for the population @xmath14 and similarly let @xmath15 be the migration rate from @xmath12 to @xmath13 for the population @xmath16 .",
    "the resulting model has the following form : @xmath17    note that a very similar model has been presented in @xcite .",
    "but ( [ sistema ] ) is more general , in that it allows different carrying capacities in the two patches for the two populations , while in @xcite only one , @xmath18 , is used , for both environments and populations .",
    "further , the environments do not affect the growth rates of each individual population , while here we allow different reproduction rates for the same population in each different patch .",
    "also , competition rates in @xcite are the same in both patches , while here they are environment - dependent .",
    "the analysis technique used in @xcite also makes the assumption that there are two time scales in the model , the fast dynamics being represented by migrations and the slow one by the demographics , reproduction and competition .",
    "based on this assumption , the system is reduced to a planar one , by at first calculating the equilibria of the fast part of the system using the aggregation method , and then the aggregated two - population slow part is analysed .    here",
    "we thus remove the assumption of a fast migration , compared with the longer lifetime population dynamics because for the large herbivores the migration process is a lifelong task , being always in search of new pastures @xcite . in different environments",
    "the resources are obviously different , making the statement on different carrying capacities more closely related to reality . finally , it is also more realistic to assume different carrying capacities for the two populations , even though they compete for resources , as in many cases the competition is only partial , in the sense that their habitats overlap , but do not completely coincide .",
    "we will consider several subcases of this system , and finally analyse it in its generality .",
    "table [ tab:1 ] defines all possible equilibria of the system ( [ sistema ] ) together with the indication of the models in which they appear . for each different model examined in",
    "what follows , we will implicitly refer to it frequently , with only changes of notation and possibly of population levels , but not for the structure of the equilibrium , i.e. the presence and absence of each individual population .",
    ".all the possible equilibria of the three ecosystems : y means that the equilibrium is possible .",
    "we indicated also the unconditional instability , and with a star the instability verified just numerically .",
    "critical means that stability is achieved only under very restrictive parameter conditions , i.e. in general the corresponding point must be considered unstable . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for the stability analyses we will need the jacobian of ( [ sistema ] ) , @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 denote the generic equilibrium point and @xmath22      we will now show that the solutions of ( [ sistema ] ) are always bounded .",
    "we shall explain the proof of this assertion for the complete model , but the same method can be used on each particular case , with obvious modifications .",
    "let us set @xmath23 .",
    "boundedness of @xmath24 implies boundedness for all the populations , since they have to be non - negative .",
    "adding up the system equations , we obtain a differential equation for @xmath24 , the right hand side of which can be bounded from above as follows @xmath25 let @xmath26    substituting in we find @xmath27 if we set @xmath28 we find @xmath29    let us now set @xmath30 and let @xmath31 be the solution of the cauchy problem @xmath32    by means of the generalized grnwall inequality we have that @xmath33 for all @xmath34 , and so @xmath35 this implies at once that @xmath24 is bounded , and thus the boundedness of the system s populations as desired .",
    "observe that the boundedness result obtained here for this minimal model is easily generalized to meta - populations living in @xmath36 patches .",
    "here we assume that the @xmath1 population can not migrate between the two environments .",
    "this may be due to the fact that it is weaker , or that there are natural obstacles that prevent it from reaching the other environment , while these obstacles instead can be overcome by the population @xmath0 .",
    "thus each subpopulation @xmath37 and @xmath38 is segregated in its own patch .",
    "this assumption corresponds therefore to setting @xmath39 into ( [ sistema ] ) . in this case",
    "we will denote the system s equilibria by @xmath40 , with @xmath41 .",
    "it is easy to show that equilibria @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 do not satisfy the first equilibrium equation , and @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 do not satisfy the third one , so that all these points are excluded from our analysis since they are unfeasible .    at the origin , @xmath50 , the jacobian ( [ jac ] ) has the eigenvalues @xmath51 and @xmath52 , @xmath53 , from which its instability follows .",
    "the point @xmath54 is unconditionally feasible , but the eigevalues of ( [ jac ] ) evaluated at @xmath55 turn out to be @xmath56 together with @xmath57 , @xmath52 , so that also @xmath55 is inconditionally unstable .",
    "the point @xmath58 is always feasible .",
    "two eigenvalues for ( [ jac ] ) are easily found , @xmath59 , @xmath57 .",
    "the other ones come from a quadratic equation , for which the routh - hurwitz conditions reduce to @xmath60 for parameter values satisfying these conditions then , @xmath61 is stable .",
    "equilibrium @xmath62 is always feasible , and the jacobian ( [ jac ] ) has eigenvalues @xmath63 again with @xmath59 , @xmath53 so that in view of the positivity of the last eigenvalue , @xmath64 is always unstable .",
    "existence for the equilibrium @xmath65 can be established as an intersection of curves in the @xmath66 phase plane .",
    "the equations that define them describe the following two convex parabolae @xmath67,\\\\ \\pi_2 : \\quad p_1(p_2)\\equiv \\frac 1{m_{21}}\\left [ r_2p_2(1-\\frac{p_2}{k_2})-m_{12}p_2 \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] both cross the coordinate axes at the origin and at another point , namely @xmath68 respectively for @xmath69 and for @xmath70 .",
    "now by drawing these curves it is easily seen that they always intersect in the first quadrant , independently of the position of these points , except when both have negative coordinates . the latter case need to be scrutinized more closely . to ensure a feasible intersection , we need to look at the parabolae slopes at the origin .",
    "thus , the feasible intersection exists if @xmath71^{-1}<1 $ ] or , explicitly when @xmath72 however , coupling this condition with the negativity of the coordinates of the above points @xmath73 and @xmath74 , intersections of the parabolae with the axes , the condition for the feasibility of @xmath65 becomes simply @xmath75 which is exactly the assumption that the coordinates of the points @xmath73 and @xmath74 be negative .",
    "hence it is automatically satisfied .",
    "further , in the particular case in which one or both such points coalesce into the origin , i.e. for either @xmath76 or @xmath77 , is it easily seen that the corresponding parabola is tangent to the origin and a feasible @xmath65 always exists . in conclusion ,",
    "the equilibrium @xmath65 is always feasible .    by using the routh - hurwitz criterion",
    "we can implicitly obtain the stability conditions as @xmath78 \\left[r_2\\left(1-\\frac{2}{k_2}p_2\\right)-m_{12}\\right ] > m_{12}m_{21}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    numerical simulations reveal that the stability conditions are a nonempty set , we obtain @xmath79 for the parameter values @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 .",

    "its stability however is easily broken under slight perturbations of the system parameters . again , thus , the coexistence equilibrium @xmath352 is not generically stable .",
    "the metapopulation models of competition type here considered show that only a few populations configurations are possible at a stable level .",
    "first of all , in virtue of our assumptions , all these ecosystems will never disappear .",
    "table [ tab:1 ] shows that equilibria @xmath353 , @xmath354 , @xmath288 , @xmath290 , @xmath292 can not occur in any one of the models considered here . of these ,",
    "@xmath354 and @xmath288 are the most interesting ones .",
    "they show that one competitor can not survive solely in one patch , while the other one thrives alone in the second patch .",
    "thus it is not possible to reverse the outcome of a superior competitor in one patch in the other patch .",
    "further , in the first patch the two populations can coexist only in the model in which only one population is allowed to migrate back and forth into the other patch , equilibrium @xmath291 . in that case",
    ", the migrating population thrives also alone in the second environment .",
    "the coexistence of all populations in both environments is `` fragile '' , it occurs only under very limited assumptions .",
    "coexistence in the second patch can occur instead with the first one empty at @xmath355 , only in the following two cases .",
    "for the one - directional migration model , with immigrations into the second patch , the first patch is left empty . when the first patch is instead populated by one species only , at equilibria @xmath356 for both the one - population and unidirectional migrations models and at @xmath289 , again for the one - directional migrations model .",
    "the equilibria in which one population is wiped out from the ecosystem instead , @xmath357 and @xmath300 , occur in all three models .",
    "finally , the three remaining equilibria contain only one population in just one patch . at @xmath358 , only for the unidirectional migration model , the migrating population survives in the arrival patch . at @xmath359",
    "it is the residential , i.e. the non - migrating , population that survives in its own patch , only for the one - population migrations model . at @xmath360 for both particular cases instead",
    ", the residential population survives in the `` arrival '' patch of the other migrating population .",
    "the model with unrestricted migration possibilities allows the survival of either one of the competing populations , in both patches , @xmath299 and @xmath300 . coupling this result with the fact that the interior coexistence has been numerically shown to be stable just for a specific parameter choice , but it is generally unstable , this result appears to be an extension of the classical competitive exclusion principle , @xcite , to metapopulation systems , in agreement with the classical literature in the field , e.g. @xcite .",
    "it is apparent here , as well as in the classical case , that an information on how the basins of attraction of the two mutually exclusive boundary equilibria is important in assessing the final outcome of the system , based on the knowledge of its present state . to this end",
    ", relevant numerical work has been performed for two dimensional systems , @xcite .",
    "an extension to higher dimensions is in progress .",
    "for the model in which only one population can migrate , two more equilibria are possible in addition to those of the full model , i.e. the resident , non - migrating , population @xmath1 can survive just in one patch with the migrating one , and the patch can be either one of the two in the model , equilibria @xmath96 and @xmath145 . the resident population can not outcompete the migrating one , since the equilibria @xmath55 and @xmath361 are both unconditionally unstable .",
    "thus , when just one population migrates , the classical principle of competitive exclusion does not necessarily hold neither at the wider metapopulation level , nor in one of the two patches , as shown by the nonvanishing population levels of patch 2 in equilibrium @xmath130 and in patch 1 in equilibrium @xmath362 .",
    "the coexistence in one of the two patches appears to be possible since the weaker species can migrate to the other competitor - free environment , thrive there and migrate back to reestablish itself with the competitor in the original environment .",
    "but the principle of competitive exclusion can in fact occur also in this model , since the numerical simulations reveal it , consider indeed the equilibrium @xmath79 .",
    "however , restrictions in the interpatch moving possibilities of one population might prevent its occurrence .",
    "the coexistence of all the populations appears to be always impossible in view of the instability of the equilibrium @xmath166 .      for this model where just one population is allowed to migrate , keeping the following demographic parameters fixed , @xmath363 and using the following migration rates @xmath364 we have respectively the following stable equilibria @xmath365 , @xmath366 .",
    "the separatrices are pictured in the top row of figure [ fig : separ_onemigr ] , the right frame containing patch 1 and the left one patch 2 . if we change the migration rates , allowing a faster return toward patch 1 , @xmath367 the second equilibrium @xmath61 remains unchanged , but we find instead that the point @xmath368 has moved toward higher @xmath113 and lower @xmath98 population values .",
    "the separatrices are plotted in the bottom row of figure [ fig : separ_onemigr ] .",
    "it is also clear that the basins of attraction in patch 1 hardly change , while in patch 2 the basin of attraction of the population @xmath38 appears to be larger with a higher emigration rate from patch 2 . correspondingly , the one of @xmath98 becomes smaller in patch 2 , according to what intuition would indicate .",
    "when migrations are allowed from patch 1 into patch 2 only , a number of other possible equilibria arise , in part replacing some of the former ones . granted",
    "that coexistence is once again forbidden for its instability , three new equilibria arise , containing either one or both populations in the patch toward which migrations occur , leaving the other one possibly empty .",
    "the principle of competitive exclusion in this case may still occur at the metapopulation level , but apparently coexistence at equilibrium @xmath195 might be possible in the patch toward which populations migrate if the stability conditions ( [ tildee4_stab ] ) coupled with the feasibility conditions ( [ tildee4_feas_b ] ) are satisfied .",
    "this appears to be also an interesting result .    again exploiting the algorithm of @xcite",
    ", we investigated also the change in shape of the basins of attraction of the two equilibria @xmath369 and @xmath370 , for this unidirectional migrations model .",
    "using once again the demographic parameters ( [ param_demog ] ) , we take at first the migration rates as follows @xmath371 obtaining equilibria @xmath372 and @xmath373 . this result is shown in the top row of figure [ fig : separ_unidir ] , again patch 1 in the right frame and patch 2 in the left one . instead with the choice @xmath374 allowing a faster rate for the population @xmath0",
    ", we again find that the second equilibrium @xmath370 is unaffected , but the first one lowers its population values , becoming @xmath375 , see bottom row of figure [ fig : separ_unidir ] . in this case",
    "the basins of attraction seem to have opposite behaviors . with a higher migration rate for @xmath98 , its basin of attraction in patch 2",
    "gets increased , while in patch 1 becomes smaller .",
    "this result is in agreement with intuition , in patch 1 the @xmath0 population become smaller and larger instead in patch 2 .",
    "we briefly discuss also the model bifurcations for the unidirectional migration model . if @xmath376 and @xmath377 , the only feasible equilibria are @xmath378 , @xmath379 , which are stable under the additional conditions @xmath380 and @xmath381 .",
    "when @xmath382 crosses the value @xmath383 and similarly @xmath384 , the two previous equilibria become unstable , and transcritical bifurcations give rise respectively to the equilibria @xmath369 and @xmath370 .",
    "the equilibrium @xmath195 may coexist with each one of the previous equilibria , but in this case @xmath378 and @xmath379 must be unstable , whereas @xmath369 and @xmath370 may be stable if their stability conditions hold .    in the two particular cases above discussed , of just one population allowed to migrate and of unidirectional migrations , our analysis shows that the standard assumptions used to study configurations in patchy environments may not always hold . under suitable conditions ,",
    "competing populations may coexist if only one migrates freely , or if migrations for both populations are allowed in the same direction and not backwards .",
