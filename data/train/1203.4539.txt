    ", we show that the concept of the poincar sphere can be extended to accommodate all four stokes parameters , and show that this extended poincar sphere can be used as a representation of the lorentz group applicable to the four - component minkowski space . in this way , it is possible to use the poincar sphere as a picture of the internal space - time symmetries as defined by wigner in 1939  @xcite .    throughout the paper",
    ", we shall use the two - by - two matrix formulation of the lorentz group  @xcite .",
    "the basic advantage is that this representation is the natural language for the two - by - two representation of the four stokes parameters . indeed , this two - by - two representation speaks one language applicable to two different branches of physics , as is illustrated in fig .",

    "let us consider a particle moving along a given direction .",
    "we can rotate the system around this direction , and boost along this direction .",
    "we can also rotate around and boost along two orthogonal directions perpendicular to the direction of the momentum .",
    "these operations can be written in the form of two - by - two matrices . in this way",

    ", we use the same set of two - by - two matrices to perform transformations on the stokes parameters and the poincar sphere .",
    "while the original three - dimensional poincar sphere is based only on three of the four stokes parameters , it is possible to extend its geometry to accommodate all four parameters . with these parameters",
    ", we can address the degree of polarization between the two orthogonal components of electric field perpendicular to the momentum . in order to deal with this problem",
    ", we introduce the decoherence parameter derivable from the traditional degree of polarization .",
    "since this parameter is greater than zero and smaller than one , we can write it as @xmath0 , and define @xmath1 as the decoherence angle .",
    "one remarkable aspect of this decoherence parameter is that it is invariant under lorentz transformations .",
    "if the symmetry of the poincar sphere is translated into the space - time symmetry , the decoherence parameter remains lorentz - invariant like the particle mass in the space - time symmetry .",
    "furthermore , to every @xmath0 , there is @xmath2 , and their symmetry is well known .",

    "einstein later derived his @xmath3 by advancing the concept of the energy - momentum four - vector obeying the same transformation law as that of the space - time coordinates .",
    "thus , the two - by - two representation is possible also for the momentum - energy four - vector .",

    "wigner s little groups dictate the internal space - time symmetries of elementary particles .",
    "they are the subgroups of the lorentz group whose transformations leave the four - momentum of the given particle invariant  @xcite .    in sec .",
    "[ jones ] , we first note that the same two - by - two matrices are applicable to two - component jones vectors .",
    "however , the jones vector can not address the problem of coherence between two transverse components of the optical beam .",
    "this is why the four - component stokes parameters are needed .",
    "the same lorentz group can be used for the four - component stokes parameters , and stokes parameters are like four - vectors , as in the case of energy - momentum four vectors .",
    "it is noted however , the degree of coherence remains invariant under lorentz transformations .    in sec .",
    "[ poincs ] , we use the geometry of the poincar sphere to describe the stokes parameters and their transformation properties .",
    "it is shown that three different radii are needed to describe them fully .",
    "the traditional radius lies between the maximum and minimum radii .",

    "[ restof ] , it is shown possible to define another poincar sphere in order to deal with variations of the decoherence parameter and the entropy .",
    "it is shown that this second poincar sphere can serve as another example of feynman s rest of the universe  @xcite .    in the the appendix",
    ", we shoe how the two - by - two transformation matrix can be translated into the four - by - four matrix applicable to the missourian four - vector .",
    "the lorentz group starts with a group of four - by - four matrices performing lorentz transformations on the minkowskian vector space of @xmath7 leaving the quantity @xmath8 invariant .",
    "it is possible to perform this transformation using two - by - two representations  @xcite .",
    "this mathematical aspect is known as the @xmath9 as the universal covering group for the lorentz group .    in this two - by - two representation ,",
    "we write the four - vector as a matrix @xmath10 then its determinant is precisely the quantity given in eq.([4vec02 ] ) .",
    "thus the lorentz transformation on this matrix is a determinant - preserving transformation .",
    "let us consider the transformation matrix as @xmath11 with @xmath12 this matrix has six independent parameters .",
    "the group of these @xmath13 matrices is known to be locally isomorphic to the group of four - by - four matrices performing lorentz transformations on the four - vector @xmath14 . in other word , for each @xmath13 matrix there is a corresponding four - by - four lorentz - transform matrix , as is illustrated in the appendix .",
    "the matrix @xmath13 is not a unitary matrix , because its hermitian conjugate is not always its inverse .",
    "the group can have a unitary subgroup called @xmath15 performing rotations on electron spins .",
    "as far as we can see , this @xmath13-matrix formalism was first presented by naimark in 1954  @xcite .",
    "thus , we call this formalism the naimark representation of the lorentz group .",
    "we shall see first that this representation is convenient for studying space - time symmetries of particles .",
    "we shall then note that this naimark representation is the natural language for the stokes parameters in polarization optics .    with this point in mind , we can now consider the transformation @xmath16 since @xmath13 is not a unitary matrix , it is not a unitary transformation . in order to tell this difference , we call this `` naimark transformation . ''",
    "this expression can be written explicitly as @xmath17    for this transformation , we have to deal with four complex numbers .",
    "however , for all practical purposes , we may work with two hermitian matrices @xmath18 and two symmetric matrices @xmath19 the two hermitian matrices in eq.([herm11 ] ) lead to rotations around the @xmath20 and @xmath21 axes respectively .",
    "the symmetric matrices in eq.([symm11 ] ) perform lorentz boosts along the @xmath20 and @xmath22 directions .",
    "repeated applications of these four matrices will lead to the most general form the of the most general form of the @xmath13 matrix of eq.([g22 ] ) with six independent parameters .",
    "for each two - by - two naimark transformation , there is a four - by - four matrix performing the corresponding lorentz transformation on the four - component four vector . in the appendix ,",
    "the four - by - four equivalents are given for the matrices of eq.([herm11 ] ) and eq.([symm11 ] ) .",
    "it was einstein who defined the energy - momentum four vector , and showed that it also has the same lorentz - transformation law as the space - time four - vector .",
    "we write the energy - momentum four vector as @xmath23 with @xmath24 which means @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the particle mass .",
    "now einstein s transformation law can be written as @xmath27 or explicitly @xmath28    later in 1939  @xcite , wigner was interested in constructing subgroups of the lorentz group whose transformations leave a given four - momentum invariant , and called these subsets `` little groups . ''",
    "thus , wigner s little group consists of two - by - two matrices satisfying @xmath29 this two - by - two @xmath30 matrix is not an identity matrix , but tells about internal space - time symmetry of the particle with a given energy - momentum four - vector .",
    "this aspect was not known when einstein formulated his special relativity in 1905 .",
    "if its determinant is a positive number , the @xmath31 matrix can be brought to the form @xmath32 corresponding to a massive particle at rest    if the determinant is negative , it can be brought to the form @xmath33 corresponding to an imaginary - mass particle moving faster than light along the @xmath20 direction , with its vanishing energy component .    if the determinant if zero , we may write @xmath31 as @xmath34 corresponding to a massless particle moving along the @xmath20 direction .    for all three of the above cases , the matrix of the form @xmath35 will satisfy the wigner condition of eq.([wigcon ] ) .",
    "this matrix corresponds to rotations around the @xmath20 axis , as is shown in the appendix .",
    "for the massive particle with the four - momentum of eq.([massive ] ) , the naimark transformations with the rotation matrix of the form @xmath36 also leaves the @xmath31 matrix of eq.([massive ] ) invariant .",
    "together with the @xmath37 matrix , this rotation matrix lead to the subgroup consisting of unitary subset of the @xmath13 matrices .",
    "the unitary subset of @xmath13 is @xmath15 corresponding to the three - dimensional rotation group dictating the spin of the particle  @xcite .",
    "for the massless case , the transformations with the triangular matrix of the form @xmath38 leaves the momentum matrix of eq.([massless ] ) invariant .",
    "the physics of this matrix has a stormy history , and the variable @xmath39 leads to gauge transformation applicable to massless particles  @xcite .    for a superluminal particle with it imaginary mass , the @xmath30 matrix of the form @xmath40 will leave the four - momentum of eq.([superlum ] )",
    "this unobservable particle does not appear to have observable internal space - time degrees of freedom .",
    "table  [ tab11 ] summarizes the transformation matrices for wigner s subgroups for massive , massless , and superluminal transformations . of course , it is a challenging problem to have one expression for all those three cases , and this problem has been addressed in the literature  @xcite .",

    "in studying the polarized light propagating along the @xmath20 direction , the traditional approach is to consider the @xmath22 and @xmath21 components of the electric fields .",
    "their amplitude ratio and the phase difference determine the state of polarization .",
    "thus , we can change the polarization either by adjusting the amplitudes , by changing the relative phase , or both . for convenience ,",
    "we call the optical device which changes amplitudes an `` attenuator '' and the device which changes the relative phase a `` phase shifter . ''",
    "the traditional language for this two - component light is the jones - matrix formalism which is discussed in standard optics textbooks  @xcite . in this formalism , the above two components are combined into one column matrix with the exponential form for the sinusoidal function @xmath47 this column matrix is called the jones vector .",
    "when the beam goes through a medium with different values of indexes of refraction for the @xmath22 and @xmath21 directions , we have to apply the matrix @xmath48 with @xmath49 . in measurement processes ,",
    "the overall phase factor @xmath50 can not be detected , and can therefore be deleted .",

    "this matrix is known as a polarizer in the textbooks  @xcite , and is a special case of the attenuation matrix of eq.([atten ] ) .",
    "this attenuation matrix tells us that the electric fields are attenuated at two different rates .",

    "the effect of polarization is solely determined by the squeeze matrix  @xcite @xmath59 this diagonal matrix is given in eq.([symm11 ] ) . in the language of space - time symmetries , this matrix performs a lorentz boost along the @xmath20 direction .",
    "the polarization axes are not always the @xmath22 and @xmath21 axes .",
    "for this reason , we need the rotation matrix @xmath60 which , according to eq.([herm11 ] ) , corresponds to the rotation around the @xmath21 axis in the space - time symmetry .    among the rotation angles ,",
    "the angle of @xmath61 plays an important role in polarization optics . indeed ,",
