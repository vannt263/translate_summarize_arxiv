    "massive galaxy clusters , the largest virialized systems in the universe , appear to be exceptionally regular objects . this is especially true at intermediate radii outside of the core ( where complicated baryonic physics plays a large role ) , and inside the actively accreting outer regions ( where non - equilibrium effects become significant ) . in these intermediate regions",
    "simple , self - similar scalings based on hydrostatic equilibrium and gravitational physics describe observations and simulations quite well @xcite .",
    "specifically , a range of observational results show approximately universal behavior among mass and intracluster medium ( icm ) profiles after scaling by characteristic overdensity radii such as @xmath0 denotes the radius where the average enclosed mass density is 500 times the critical density . throughout this manuscript",
    "we define quantities at , or enclosed within , this characteristic radius . ] and by self - similar mass- and redshift - dependent normalizations ( @xcite , hereafter a10 , @xcite , hereafter p12 , @xcite ) . for example",
    ", the cluster - to - cluster dispersion ( intrinsic scatter ) observed in these scaled profiles outside of the core regions and inside @xmath0 is generally @xmath12 @xmath11% for entropy @xcite , gas density @xcite , temperature @xcite , and pressure ( a10 , * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , both simulations and observations indicate low cluster - to - cluster dispersion in pressure profiles at intermediate radii ( @xcite , a10 , @xcite , p12 ) .    historically , observational studies of the icm pressure have relied almost exclusively on x - ray data .",
    "these data have provided precise constraints on the pressure profiles in the inner regions of clusters ( @xmath13 ) , but the density - squared dependence of the x - ray surface brightness makes it difficult to study the icm at large radii with x - rays .",
    "although several x - ray results have extended beyond @xmath0 in individual clusters or small sets of clusters @xcite , with current x - ray instrumentation it is infeasible to extend such studies to large samples of clusters .",
    "consequently , two groups have used a hybrid approach with x - ray data at small radii ( @xmath14 ) and simulations at large radii ( @xmath15 ) in order to constrain the average pressure profile at all relevant radial scales ( * ? ? ?",
    "these x - ray and simulation - based results imply that cluster pressure profiles are approximately universal over a wide range of masses and radial scales , with low intrinsic scatter that is minimized near 0.5@xmath0 at @xmath16% .",
    "the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect signal @xcite , which is proportional to the density of the icm and therefore falls more slowly with radius compared to the x - ray brightness , can be exploited to study the icm pressure at large radii .",
    "although some initial studies using _ wmap _ sz data showed large inconsistencies with the established x - ray results @xcite , recent results have shown that sz data from _ wmap _ , _ planck _ , and ground - based receivers provide a picture of the icm that is consistent with x - ray measurements at current observational precision @xcite . in particular , the south pole telescope ( spt ) was able to measure the average sz pressure profile out to @xmath17 for a sample of 15 clusters @xcite , finding results that were similar to previous x - ray / simulation results at small / large radii ( e.g. , the sample of 31 rexcess clusters studied by a10 ) .",
    "recently , a combination of _ xmm - newton _ x - ray data at small radii and _ planck _ sz effect data at large radii was used to constrain the average pressure profile out to @xmath18 for a sample of 62 _ planck_-selected clusters ( p12 ) .",
    "these results were again largely consistent with previous analyses , and the x - ray and sz data agreed quite well in the overlapping region at intermediate radii . altogether ,",
    "x - ray and sz data , along with simulations , are converging to a uniform picture of the average cluster pressure profile over a wide range of angular scales .",
    "this manuscript is arranged as follows . in section  [ sec : sample ] we describe our sample of 45 massive clusters , and in section  [ sec : reduction ] we provide the details of our sz and x - ray data reduction .",
    "we then present our method for deprojecting pressure profiles from our spatially - filtered sz images in section  [ sec : deproj ] . in section  [ sec : gnfw",
    "] , we describe parametric fits to these deprojected profiles , and compare the results of our fits to the results from a range of previous analyses .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : mass ] , we use a gaussian process formalism to simultaneously constrain the pressure - profile mass scaling , the ensemble mean profile , and the radius - dependent intrinsic scatter about this mean profile .",
    "finally , we provide a summary of our results in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "between 2006 november and 2012 march we used bolocam to image the sz signals from a sample of 45 clusters that have _ chandra _ x - ray exposures ( hereafter the bolocam x - ray / sz or boxsz sample ) .",
    "the bolocam sz observations and some general properties of the boxsz sample are summarized in table  [ tab : cluster_sample ] , and the details of the _ chandra _ x - ray data and analysis are given in tables  [ tab : chandra ] and [ tab : cluster_sample_2 ] .",
    "the boxsz sample contains two previously defined subsamples , the 25 object cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble ( clash ) sample @xcite and the 12 cluster macs high-@xmath19 sample @xcite .",
    "the remaining clusters were selected in an _ ad hoc _ manner , with a general emphasis on massive and/or high redshift systems .",
    "the clusters span the redshift range @xmath20 , with a median redshift of 0.42 and more than 60% of the sample lying between @xmath21 .",
    "the clusters are among the most massive known , with a median x - ray derived mass of @xmath22  m@xmath23 assuming a constant gas mass fraction ( we computed these masses using a reference @xmath24 , @xmath25 flat @xmath26cdm cosmology , and this same cosmology was used to calculate all other physical quantities presented in this manuscript ) . the clusters in the boxsz sample span a range of dynamical states , from relaxed systems with well defined cool - cores like abell 1835 @xcite to clusters undergoing major merger events like macs j0717.5 @xcite .",

    "in order to determine physical pressures from our sz data ( which are measured in units of a cmb fluctuation temperature ) we use the equations described by @xcite with the relativistic corrections given by @xcite . for the relativistic corrections , we have assumed that the icm of each cluster is isothermal , with a temperature equal to the spectroscopic x - ray temperature given in table  [ tab : cluster_sample_2 ] .",

    "even if the icm temperature varies by a factor of two over the radial range probed by our data , then our isothermal approximation will produce less than a 5% bias on the pressures that we derive .",
    "due to the high - pass filtering applied to the bolocam data to remove atmospheric noise , it is not possible to directly deproject pressure profiles from the standard bolocam images .",
    "we have demonstrated the ability to deconvolve the effects of this high pass filter @xcite , and we are able to produce unbiased images that could in principal be deprojected .",
    "however , to prevent unphysical numerical artifacts from appearing in the deconvolved images , we would need to reduce the size of our images from 14 to 10 arcmin .",
    "since we are interested in information about the pressure profiles at large radii , we do not want to accept this loss of information .",
    "consequently , we compute our deprojected pressure profiles as follows .",
    "first , we select a set of discrete radial points ( referred to as radial bins ) at which we would like to compute the spherically symmetric deprojected pressure .",
    "next , we create a smooth and continuous pressure profile by connecting these radial bins with a power - law interpolation .",
    "this smooth pressure profile is then projected into a two dimensional sz model .",
    "for the projection , we assume that the profile is equal to zero outside of @xmath358 , and we use a power - law extrapolation to estimate the pressure profile beyond our largest radial bin and inside @xmath358 .",
    "we then filter this sz model with both the signal transfer function of our data and the bolocam psf , and then compare the filtered sz model to our data map .",
    "we determine the best fit pressure deprojections using the mpfitfun generalized least squares ( gls ) fitting algorithm @xcite under the simplifying assumption that the noise covariance matrix of our sz maps is diagonal .",
    "as described in @xcite , a diagonal noise covariance matrix is a very good , but not perfect , description of our sz map data .",
    "consequently , we compute all of our uncertainties using the 1000 different noise realizations described in section  [ sec : bolocam_reduction ] . first , we add a cluster model , equal to the best fit deprojection of our data , separately to each of these 1000 noise realizations .",
    "we then fit a pressure deprojection to each of these 1000 model - plus - noise realizations , and quantify all of our uncertainties based on the spread of these 1000 fits . by design , this procedure fully accounts for all of the characteristics of our noise to quantify our uncertainties for a deprojection of a cluster with a pressure profile described by our best - fit deprojection .",
    "one possible bias in this approach is that it only quantifies the uncertainties for a particular cluster shape , and the true cluster profile might differ from our best - fit profile .",
    "consequently , we tested this effect by computing uncertainties for our deprojection fits using both the best - fit profile to our cluster sample ( section  [ sec : gnfw ] ) and the best - fit profile found by a10 as the input shapes added to our 1000 noise realizations . we find that the uncertainties recovered using an a10 profile differ from the recovered uncertainties using our best - fit profile by an rms of 7.7% .",
    "if the uncertainties were identical , then we would expect an rms difference of 4.5% due to our finite number of noise realizations .",
    "this indicates that our uncertainties on the recovered deprojection depend slightly on the exact shape of the cluster pressure profile .",
    "however , since the true cluster pressure profile is likely to be similar to our best - fit profile , and since the variation in recovered uncertainties is similar to our precision in estimating them due to our finite number of noise realizations , we do not attempt to account for the cluster - shape dependence of our recovered uncertainties in our analysis .",
    "finally , we have verified that our gls algorithm adequately samples the parameter space by showing that it is robust to our choice of initial conditions , and that we are able to recover an input cluster candidate with minimal bias ( see figure  [ fig : gls ] ) .    , and",
    "for the green squares all of the starting values were set equal to a randomly drawn value between 0 and @xmath359 ) . in all cases , the bias is quasi - negligible when added in quadrature with the uncertainty ( note that the typical s / n per bin is @xmath344 , so the absolute bias is @xmath356% ) .",
    "this result shows that our fitting method is approximately unbiased and that it is robust to our choice of initial conditions ( i.e. , it adequately explores the parameter space ) . ]    throughout this work we compare and average the pressure profiles from multiple clusters .",
    "therefore , prior to any deprojection , we have scaled the radial coordinate of each cluster by @xmath0 and the pressure amplitude by @xmath360 where @xmath361 and @xmath362 is the nominal scaling predicted by self - similar hydrostatic equilibrium models ( * ? ? ?",
    ", mainly because such corrections have negligible effects on our results .",
    "for example , correcting the value of @xmath363 from 2/3 to our best - fit @xmath364 found in section  [ sec : mass ] causes the pressure values in the individual joint deprojection bins for the full sample to change by @xmath365% . ]",
    "we note that our definition of @xmath366 is valid for the electron pressure of the icm and not the total pressure .",
    "we have determined the average pressure profile of the full boxsz sample ( along with the disturbed and cool - core subsamples ) via a simultaneous joint deprojection of multiple clusters . in this approach , a single deprojected profile in units of @xmath366 and @xmath0",

    "pressure deprojections for the full boxsz sample , the cool - core subsample , and the disturbed subsample are shown in figure  [ fig : deprojection ] and numerical values are given in table  [ tab : deprojection ] .",
    "for the deprojection of the full boxsz sample , we have used 13 approximately logarithmically spaced bins between 0.07@xmath0 and 3.5@xmath0 .",
    "these deprojections extend beyond the cluster virial radius ( typically near @xmath367 , @xcite ) , although only in two deprojection bins , each with a s / n @xmath340 . due to the smaller number of clusters in the two subsamples , we have used 7 bins spanning the same radial range in each case .",
    "we note that , for many of the clusters in our sample , particularly the preferentially higher redshift disturbed clusters , the innermost radial bin(s ) is(are ) inside of bolocam s psf half - maximum radius of 29  arcsec ( in the most extreme case 0.07@xmath0 is @xmath368  arcsec ) .",
    "however , we have shown that even for the disturbed subsample we are able to obtain unbiased fits to the innermost bins for deprojections of model input clusters , indicating that our joint deprojections are sensitive to the shape of the pressure profile at these sub - psf - sized scales .    .",

    "consequently , we have deprojected the individual clusters at fixed angular radii to ensure that they adequately constrain the profile over the scales probed by our data ( 0.5 , 1.0 , 2.0 , 4.0 , and 8.0  arcmin ) .",

    "such fits have been performed in a number of previous analyses ( e.g. , a10 and p12 ) , and these fits therefore enable us to directly compare our results to the results of those works . since these fits ask a relatively simple question of our data ( i.e. , what is the measurement - noise - weighted average pressure profile ) , they also allow us to constrain the average profile of our sample with optimal signal to noise over a broad radial range , even for physically interesting subsets of the boxsz . in section",
    "[ sec : mass ] , we introduce a new technique for probing the ensemble behavior of cluster pressure profiles using a gaussian process formalism . for this analysis we use the individual cluster pressure deprojections to simultaneously constrain an ensemble mean pressure profile , a covariance matrix describing the intrinsic scatter about this mean profile , and the mass scaling of the pressure profiles .",
    "this novel technique asks a more demanding set of questions of our data compared to a parametric fit of the average profile , and consequently limits us to constraints over a smaller radial range .",
    "one method for characterizing the gross behavior of pressure profiles in our sample ( or a subsample ) is to fit a parameterized function to the data .",
    "for this analysis , we fit parametric models to our deprojected data , rather than directly to the map data , because fitting directly to the map data takes an inconveniently large amount of computing time , several days . as we describe in detail below",
    ", we found that parametric fits to our deprojected profiles , which require only a few minutes , were indistinguishable from parametric fits directly to the map data .",
    "we emphasize that there is no fundamental reason why the fits can not be performed directly to the map data , and our choice to fit the deprojected profiles was motivated entirely by computational expediency .    to perform the parametric fits to our deprojected data , we make the simplifying assumption that the noise is gaussian and therefore fully described by its covariance matrix .",
    "we applied mardia s test of multivariate normality to confirm this assumption is correct @xcite .",
    "mardia s skewness statistic has a limiting distribution equal to the @xmath397 distribution , and we find a @xmath397 per degree of freedom ( dof ) equal to @xmath398 ( corresponding to a probability to exceed ( pte ) of 0.36 ) .",
    "mardia s kurtosis statistic has a limiting distribution equal to the unit normal distribution , and we find a value of @xmath399 ( corresponding to a two - sided pte of 0.34 ) .",
    "therefore , the noise properties of our deprojected profiles are consistent with gaussian distributions .",
    "in addition , we directly fit a single generalized navarro , frenk , and white ( nfw , * ? ? ? * ) model to our map data , allowing all five parameters to vary .",
    "this model is described by @xmath400^{(\\mathcal{\\beta }        -\\mathcal{\\gamma})/\\mathcal{\\alpha}}},\\ ] ] where @xmath401 is the scaled pressure profile ( in units of @xmath366 ) , @xmath402 , @xmath5 is the normalization , @xmath1 sets the radial scale , and @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 describe the power law slope at moderate , large , and small radii @xcite . similarly to our deprojection procedure , we then determined our parameter uncertainties using fits to 1000 separate noise realizations . for comparison , we then performed a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) fit of the same model to our deprojected profile assuming a gaussian covariance matrix .",
    "we find that the profiles recovered from fitting the map data directly and from fitting the deprojected data agree within @xmath403% for the range of our deprojected data ( @xmath404 ) , indicating that the two methods recover consistent results .",
    "finally , we have verified that there are no biases in our parametric model fits to either the map data or the deprojected data by performing both types of fits to a simulated cluster with a known profile .",
    "specifically , we added a cluster with the best - fit a10 pressure profile to each of the 1000 noise realizations for each cluster , and repeated our analysis on each of these simulated data sets .",
    "we find that the average best - fit gnfw profiles to these data , both from direct fits to the map data and from fits to the joint deprojections , agree with the input a10 profile within @xmath403% between @xmath405 and @xmath406 .",
    "since we find no significant difference between gnfw fits directly to the map data and gnfw fits obtained from the deprojected data , we obtained all of the results described below from fits to the deprojected data .",
    "we find that our data do not constrain all five of the gnfw fit parameters within the physically allowed region .",

    "the quality of this four - parameter fit is good ( @xmath410 for 9 dof ) , indicating that this four - parameter gnfw fit describes our data with a sufficient goodness of fit .",
    "we note that the actual pressure profile over the radial range constrained by our data ( @xmath411 ) for this four - parameter gnfw fit is only slightly different from the five - parameter fit , indicating that the unphysical outer slope in the five - parameter gnfw fit is likely due to the finite radial extent of our data .",
    "therefore , the best - fit gnfw model of the boxsz sample is given by @xmath412 =     [ { \\it 1.18 } , 0.86 , 3.67 , 0.67 , 4.29],\\ ] ] where the value of @xmath1 is in italics to emphasize that it was held fixed at 1.18 in our fits .",
    "our choice to fix the value of @xmath1 , rather than one of the other parameters , was motivated by the fact that all of the possible four - parameter gnfw fits have similar fit qualities , but any combination that varies both @xmath1 and @xmath3 results in an unphysical outer slope .",
    "the set of two - dimensional confidence regions for the four - parameter gnfw fit is illustrated in figure  [ fig : fit_contours ] , and the strong parameter degeneracies mentioned above are evident in these plots . to test for possible biases associated with our choice to fix @xmath1 to the best - fit value determined by a10",

    "compared to our choice of @xmath408 , we find that these values of @xmath1 result in similar fit qualities and profiles that differ by an rms of 4% ( p12 ) and 1% @xcite over the radial range @xmath404 .",

    "mathematically , the likelihood for a single realization of @xmath437 to have a set of scaled pressures @xmath438 at scaled radii @xmath439 is proportional to @xmath440 where @xmath441 and @xmath442 , for any pair of radial values @xmath443 and @xmath444 .",
    "thus , the diagonal covariance terms , @xmath445 dictate the marginal intrinsic scatter among profiles at a given radius ; while off - diagonal terms , @xmath436 with @xmath446 , determine whether realizations of the profile tend to be shifted coherently with respect to @xmath447 ( positive values ) , or tend to cross @xmath447 ( negative values ) .",

    "the interpolation was accomplished as follows .",
    "first , we generate a multivariate normal draw of the pressures at the deprojection radii using the measured mean values and measurement error covariance matrices of the individual cluster deprojections from section  [ sec : deproj ] .",
    "we then interpolate these pressures to the set of 5 common scaled radii using a power - law interpolation ( recall that our deprojections assumed power - law behavior between the deprojection radii ) .",
    "this process is repeated many times in order to constrain the mean pressures and the measurement error covariance matrices at the common scaled radii . since the individual profiles do not cover the entire range @xmath450 , each cluster provides information at only a subset of the final radii .",
    "the result of this procedure is that the mean profile and covariance function can be compactly parametrized by 5 pressure values ( for @xmath447 ) and the independent elements of a @xmath451 covariance matrix ( for @xmath452 ) , corresponding to the common scaled radii , where otherwise we would have been forced to assume a particular functional form for @xmath452 .",

    "this result provides additional evidence that pressure profiles are approximately universal over a wide range of masses and redshifts , with intrinsic scatter of @xmath10@xmath11% about the universal profile , and that sz and x - ray measurements of these profiles are consistent with each other given current observational precision .",

    "<S> we describe sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect measurements and analysis of the intracluster medium ( icm ) pressure profiles of a set of 45 massive galaxy clusters imaged using bolocam at the caltech submillimeter observatory . </S>",
    "<S> we deproject the average pressure profile of our sample into 13 logarithmically spaced radial bins between 0.07@xmath0 and 3.5@xmath0 , and we find that a generalized navarro , frenk , and white ( gnfw ) profile describes our data with sufficient goodness - of - fit and best - fit parameters ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 = 1.18 , 0.86 , 3.67 , 0.67 , 4.29 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we use x - ray data to define cool - core and disturbed subsamples of clusters , and we constrain the average pressure profiles of each of these subsamples . we find that , given the precision of our data , the average pressure profiles of disturbed and cool - core clusters are consistent with one another at @xmath6 , with cool - core systems showing indications of higher pressure at @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , for the first time , we place simultaneous constraints on the mass scaling of cluster pressure profiles , their ensemble mean profile , and their radius - dependent intrinsic scatter between 0.1@xmath0 and 2.0@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the scatter among profiles is minimized at radii between @xmath8 and @xmath9 , with a value of @xmath10% . </S>",
    "<S> these results for the intrinsic scatter are largely consistent with previous analyses , most of which have relied heavily on x - ray derived pressures of clusters at significantly lower masses and redshifts compared to our sample . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , our data provide further evidence that cluster pressure profiles are largely universal with scatter of @xmath10@xmath11% about the universal profile over a wide range of masses and redshifts . </S>"
