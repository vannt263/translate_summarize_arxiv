    "obtaining reliable knowledge about the structure and distance of nearby ob associations plays a critical role in the overall study of the milky way morphology near the sun . unlike the external galaxies where the star - forming fields are generally evident from direct imaging , the study of the spiral structure of our own galaxy",
    "is largely grounded in distance determinations of young stellar tracers . at present , sufficiently accurate astrometric data ( parallaxes and proper motions ) are available for few star - forming regions within @xmath15 pc .",
    "more comprehensive and representative studies of the local history and dynamics of star formation have to rely on the photometric method of distance determination and stellar evolution theory .    the completion of the @xmath0 catalog ( esa 1997 ) offered a possibility for a major improvement of the membership of young moving groups near the sun and refining the distance scale to nearby open clusters and ob associations",
    ". however , the mean @xmath0 parallaxes for some galactic clusters are in disagreement with ground - based determinations by various methods .",
    "statistically significant discrepancies between the @xmath0 trigonometric and traditional photometric , spectroscopic and interferometric results have been reported in the literature for selected small - scale fields , most notably for the pleiades open cluster ( pinsonneault et al .",

    "platais et al .",
    "( 2007 ) found a similar offset in the @xmath0 mean parallax for the young open cluster ic 2391 .",
    "a discrepancy was reported by kaltcheva et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for the open cluster ic 2602 as well .",
    "the cause for these inconsistencies is most likely due to a faulty data reduction algorithm used in @xmath0 , which allowed highly correlated errors of along - scan attitude parameters to propagate into the fitted astrometric parameters .",
    "an alternative data reduction approach has been suggested and successfully tested by makarov ( 2002 , 2003 ) .",
    "the region of cr 121 is another example of this discrepancy . since the discovery of a compact group at @xmath16= @xmath17 by collinder ( 1931 ) , both the cluster and the larger @xmath18 x @xmath18 field have been extensively studied by ubv and @xmath4 photometry .",
    "this area includes one of the 12 ob associations within 1 kpc from the sun with fairly detailed kinematical information and membership determined from @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath0 proper motions reveal a moving group of 103 stars between @xmath19 and @xmath20 , identifying the compact cluster cr 121 with an unbound extended ob association at a distance of 592@xmath2128 pc , similar to sco ob2 ( de zeeuw et al .",
    "robichon et al .",
    "( 1999 ) selected 13 @xmath0 members of cr 121 and found a mean @xmath0 parallax of 1.80@xmath210.24 mas ( @xmath22 pc ) .",
    "in contrast to these results from @xmath0 , the latest @xmath4 photometric study ( kaltcheva 2000 ) concluded that a compact stellar group apparently identical to the genuine cluster ( cr 121 ) is situated at 1085@xmath2141 pc and the closest members of the loose association are found at an average distance of 660 - 730 pc , in agreement with most of the previous photometric investigations .",
    "since the @xmath4 photometry is arguably the best photometric system in use to provide accurate photometric distances , the origin of the discrepancy was suggested to be in the @xmath0 parallaxes for the cr 121 members .",
    "burningham et al .",
    "( 2003 ) studied the low - mass pre - main sequence stars toward cr 121 and also came to conclusions consistent with the photometric distance determinations .    in this letter",
    ", we consider a sample of probable members of the extended association around cr 121 selected by de zeeuw et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for which accurate @xmath4 photometry is available . the astrometric parameters of these stars are recomputed from the @xmath0 intermediate astrometry data by the method proposed by makarov ( 2002 ) .",
    "the recomputed parallaxes allow us to resolve the controversy about the distance and dimensions of the ob association in this field .",
    "our sample contains all 44 early - type stars with @xmath0 parallaxes listed by de zeeuw et al .",
    "( 1999 ) as probable members of the cr 121 moving group for which @xmath4 photometry is available .",
    "homogeneous photometric @xmath4 distances are calculated for 43 of them ( kaltcheva 2000 ) .",
    "table 1 presents the sample , where the @xmath0 identification numbers are given in the first column , followed by the @xmath0 parallaxes and their errors , recalculated parallaxes and their errors , photometric @xmath4 distances and mk spectral classification .",
    "the stars are formally divided into field stars ( or possible association members ) , spread over a @xmath23 area around the center of cr 121 and 6 photometrically selected members of the dense cluster cr 121 ( kaltcheva 2000 and references therein ) . as follows from the data in table 1",
    "there is a statistically significant difference between the mean @xmath0 parallax of @xmath24 mas and the mean recomputed parallax of @xmath25 mas .",
    "the errors provided here are the formal standard deviation of the mean computed from the formal errors of parallaxes .",
    "1 shows the original @xmath0 parallaxes ( left plot ) and our recomputed parallaxes ( right plot ) versus the photometric parallaxes for the sample of 43 stars in table  1 .",
    "the @xmath0 parallaxes are on average larger than the photometric values by 0.52@xmath210.107 mas , where the quoted error is the sample standard error of the mean .",
    "this is a statistically significant difference of the same order as those found for the pleiades and a few other galactic clusters . on the other hand",
    ", the agreement is excellent between the mean photometric parallax and the mean corrected parallax ( @xmath26 mas ) .",
    "this supports our main conclusion that the @xmath0 parallaxes are systematically overestimated in this area of the sky . but fig .",
    "1 also reveals another strange property of the original parallaxes .",
    "while the recomputed parallaxes are scattered fairly symmetrically around the line of unit slope in the right plot and their dispersion is in good agreement with the measurement errors , the original parallaxes are grouped tightly around the mean ( @xmath27 mas ) with a standard deviation of only @xmath28 mas .",
    "this value is much too small for the estimated formal errors ( mean @xmath29 mas , _ rms _ @xmath30 mas ) .",
    "we attribute this result to a strong selection effect in the method employed by de zeeuw et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , which preferentially accepted stars with large measured parallaxes , i.e. , mostly stars with positive errors `` observed minus true '' . in combination with the correlated error of the mean parallax",
    ", this selection bias gives rise to doubt about the completeness and reliability of the present membership list .",
    "the significant dispersion of both photometric and recomputed parallaxes also implies a complex morphology of this moving group having a considerable depth , as opposed to the previous conjecture of an association compressed in the radial dimension , similar to the nearby sco ob2 association , as concluded by de zeeuw et al .",
    "the group also appears to be located at a larger distance of @xmath31 pc , rather than at @xmath1 pc as follows from the mean @xmath0 parallax of the sample in table 1 .",
    "based on a larger photometric sample it has already been pointed out that the loose nearby structure defined by de zeeuw et al .",
    "( 1999 ) to be located at 592@xmath32 pc photometrically appears to be more distant by about 100 pc ( kaltcheva 2000 ) .",
    "the parallaxes recalculated here support the photometric findings .",
    "our result implies that the problem of inaccurate mean parallaxes in @xmath0 affects more regions , and of larger angular area , than just a few small patches occupied by dense open clusters .",
    "this is not an irreversible situation , because the method of astrometric solution of the available @xmath0 data used in this paper proves once again successful in correcting this error , despite its limitations .",
    "a more systematic and thorough comparison of @xmath0 data with distances from precision multi - band photometry will probably reveal more problematic areas .",
    "it is not clear at present how widely spread the parallax error is , and whether a global astrometric solution will have a significant impact on the present knowledge of distances and morphology for many of the ob associations represented in the catalog , but it is evident that the @xmath0-based census of some of the moving groups near the sun should be critically reconsidered .",
