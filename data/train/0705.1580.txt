    "the most commonly used interstellar dust grain model , consists of two distinct populations of bare spherical silicate and graphite grains with a power law size distribution ( mathis et al .",
    "this model , popularly known as mrn model provides an excellent fit to the average observed interstellar extinction curve . however , it is highly unlikely that the interstellar grains are spherical in shape or that they are homogeneous in composition and structure .",
    "the collected interplanetary particles are nonspherical and highly porous and composites of very small sub - grains glued together ( brownlee , 1987 ) .",
    "moreover , the interstellar polarization that accompanies extinction requires that the interstellar grains must be aligned and nonspherical ( wolff et .",
    "al . 1993 )",
    ". recently stark et al . (",
    "2006 ) have suggested the growth of spheroidal grains via plasma deposition in the supernova remnant .",
    "the elemental abundances derived from the observed interstellar extinction also do not favour the homogeneous composition for the interstellar grains .",
    "recent studies suggest that the abundances of various elements in the interstellar medium ( ism ) are less than their solar values ( snow & witt , 1996 ; voshchinnikov et al . , 2006 ) .",
    "for example in case of carbon , its solar abundance normalized to a hydrogen abundance of @xmath1 atoms , is about 355 ( grevesse et al . 1996 ) . in the ism",
    "the abundance of this element is significantly lower , about 225 c atoms ( snow & witt 1995 ) .",
    "also a significant amount of this interstellar carbon is in gas phase . from cii 2325",
    "absorption measurements , cardelli et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have inferred a c abundance of about 150 atoms .",
    "this means that a total of about 100 c atoms are available for the dust phase , compared with about 300 atoms required for the bare grain models ( e.g. mathis et al .",
    "1977 , mrn ) . in order to overcome the cosmic abundance constraints mathis & whiffen ( 1989 ) , mathis ( 1996 ) and dwek ( 1997 ) have proposed composite grain models consisting of silicate and amorphous carbon as constituent materials .",
    "they have used effective medium theory ( emt ) to calculate the optical constants for composite grains and then used the mie theory to calculate extinction cross sections for spheres in emt the inhomogeneous particle is replaced by a homogeneous one with some average effective dielectric function. the effects related to the fluctuations of the dielectric function within the inhomogeneous structures can not be treated by this approach of the emt .",
    "mathis ( 1996 ) has also noted the uncertainty in the use of emt for treating the composite grains and has suggested that detailed calculations such as the dda would be necessary for the treatment of voids in silicate / graphite particles for some wavelengths .",
    "iati et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have studied optical properties of composite grains as grain aggregates of amorphous carbon and astronomical silicates , using the transition matrix approach .",
    "voshchinnikov et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have studied properties of composite grains as layered spheres .",
    "very recently voshchinnikov et al . (",
    "2006 ) have studied the effect of grain porosity on interstellar extinction , dust temperature , infrared bands and millimeter opacity .",
    "they have used both , the emt - mie based calculations and layered sphere model .",
    "we have used discrete dipole approximation ( dda ) to study the extinction properties of the composite grains . for",
    "the description on the dda see draine ( 1988 ) .",
    "the dda allows the consideration of irregular shape effects , surface roughness and internal structure within the grain ( wolff et al .",
    "1994 , 1998 and voshchinnikov et al .",
    "2005 ) . for discussion and comparison of dda and emt methods , including the limits of the effective medium theory , see bazell and dwek ( 1990 ) , perrin and lamy ( 1990 ) , perrin and sivan ( 1990 ) , ossenkopf ( 1991 ) and wolff et al ( 1994 ) .",
    "in our earlier study we had used composite spherical grain models to evaluate the interstellar extinction curve in the wavelength range 0.550.20@xmath0 ( vaidya et.al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "in the present study , we use more realistic composite spheroidal grain models and calculate the extinction efficiencies in the extended wavelength region , 3.400.10@xmath0 and linear polarization in the visible - near infrared region , i.e. 0.351.00@xmath0 .    using these extinction efficiencies of the composite grains with a power law type grain size distribution",
    "we evaluate the interstellar extinction curve and linear polarization .",
    "in addition to reproducing the observed interstellar extinction curve , the grain model should also be consistent with the abundance constraints .",
    "we estimate the volume extinction factor , an important parameter from the point of view of the cosmic abundance , for the composite grain models that reproduce the average observed extinction . in section 2",
    "we give the validity criteria for the dda and the composite grain models . in section 3",
    "we present the results of our computations and discuss them .",
    "the main conclusions of our study are given in section 4 .",
    "the basic dda method consists of replacing a particle by an array of n oscillating polarizable point dipoles ( draine , 1988 ) .",
    "the dipoles are located on a lattice and the polarizability is related to the complex refractive index @xmath2 through a lattice dispersion relationship ( draine & goodman , 1993 ) .",
    "each dipole responds to the external electric field as well as to the electric field of the other n-1 dipoles that comprise the grain . the polarization at each dipole site is therefore coupled to all other dipoles in the grain .",
    "in the present study , we have used the ddscat6.1 code ( draine & flatau , 2003 ) which has been modified and developed by dobbie ( 1999 ) to generate the composite grain models .",
    "the code , first carves out an outer sphere ( or spheroid ) from a lattice of dipole sites .",
    "sites outside the sphere are vacuum and sites inside are assigned to the host material .",
    "once the host grain is formed , the code locates centers for internal spheres to form inclusions .",
    "the inclusions are of a single radius and their centers are chosen randomly .",
    "the code then outputs a three dimensional matrix specifying the material type at each dipole site which is then received by the ddscat program . in the present case ,",
    "the sites are either silicates , graphite or vacuum .    using the modified code ,",
    "we have studied composite grain models with a host silicate spheroid containing number of dipoles n=9640 , 25896 and 14440 , each carved out from @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 dipole sites , respectively ; sites outside the spheroid are set to be vacuum and sites inside are assigned to be the host material .",
    "it is to be noted that the composite spheroidal grain with n=9640 has an axial ratio of 1.33 , whereas n=25896 has the axial ratio 1.5 , and n=14440 has the axial ratio 2.0 .",
    "the volume fractions of the graphite inclusions used are 10% , 20% and 30% ( denoted as f=0.1 , 0.2 and 0.3 ) details on the computer code and the corresponding modification to the ddscat code ( draine & flatau 2003 ) are given in dobbie ( 1999 ) , vaidya et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and gupta et al .",
    "figure 1 and 2 illustrate the composite grain model with number of dipoles n=9640 for the host spheroid and eleven inclusions .",
    "table 1 shows the number of dipoles for each grain model ( first column ) , number of dipoles per inclusion with the number of inclusions denoted in bracket for volume fraction f=0.1 ( second column ) .",
    "the third and fourth column are the corresponding values for the remaining volume fractions i.e. f=0.2 and 0.3 .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is seen that for all the three volume fractions of inclusions , viz .",
    "f=0.1 , 0.2 and f=0.3 , the composite grain model with n=25896 ( axial ratio 1.5 ) is the most efficient in producing the visual extinction .",
    "the volume extinction factor v@xmath6 is the lowest for this grain model .",
    "it is important to note here , that these values of the volume extinction factors for the composite grain models , containing silicate as host and graphite as inclusions , are much lower than what we had obtained for the bare silicate and graphite grain models ( gupta et al . 2005 ) .",
    "these results on the volume extinction factors clearly indicate that the composite grains are more efficient in producing the extinction i.e. the amount of silicate and graphite required is less than that would be required for the bare silicate / graphite models . the number of atoms ( in ppm ) of the particular material tied up in grains can be estimated if the atomic mass of the element in the grain material and the density of the material are known ( see e.g. cecchi - pestellini et al .",
    "1995 and iati et al .",
    "2001 ) . from the composite grain models we have proposed , we estimate c abundance i.e. c / h to be between 160 - 180 ( including those atoms that produce the 2175   feature ) , which is considerably lower than what is predicted by bare silicate / graphite grain models ( e.g. c / h=300 ppm , mathis et al . 1977 ; c / h=254 ppm , li and draine , 2001 ) but it is still significantly above the recent ism value of 110 ( mathis 2000 ) the estimated si abundance from the composite grain model presented here is between 24 - 28 , which is higher than the ism value of 17 ppm ( snow and witt 1996 , voshchinnikov 2002 )",
    "but it is lower than the other recent grain models ( @xmath7 32 , li and draine , 2001 ) .",
    "recently voshchinnikov et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have estimated very low values for c / h ( @xmath7137 ) and si / h ( @xmath78.8 ) with their highly porous grain models . in table 5",
    ", we also show the estimated c / h and si / h abundance values derived from the composite grain model n=9640 which is the best fit model .",
    "snow ( 2000 ) has addressed the issues related to and the question of appropriate reference abundance standards and has noted that no model for the dust extinction copes successfully with the reduced quantities of available elements imposed by the revised cosmic abundance standards and the consequent reductions in depletions .",
    "draine ( 2003a ) has also pointed that the uncertainties in the gas - phase depletions and in the dust compositions are quite large and hence one should not worry about the dust models that contradict the abundance constraints , up to a factor of two .",
    "weingartner and draine ( 2001 ) have used populations of separate silicate , graphite and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) spherical grains to obtain extinction curves in the milky way , large magellanic cloud and small magellanic cloud .",
    "the composite grain models with silicates , graphite and a separate component of pahs as constituent materials may further help to reduce the requirements to match the abundance constraints .",
    "recently , piovan et .",
    "al ( 2006 ) have also noted that any realistic model of a dusty ism to be able to explain the uv - optical extinction and ir emission has to include at least three components , i.e. graphite , silicate and pahs .",
    "using the discrete dipole approximation ( dda ) we have studied the extinction properties of the composite spheroidal grains , made up of the host silicate and graphite inclusions in the wavelength region of 3.400.10@xmath0 .",
    "we have also calculated the linear polarization in the wavelength region , 1.000.30@xmath0 .",
    "our main conclusions from this study are :    \\(1 ) the extinction curves for the composite spheroidal grains show the shift in the central wavelength of the extinction peak as well as variation in the width of the peak with the variation in the volume fraction of the graphite inclusions .",
    "these results clearly indicate that the shape , structure and inhomogeneity in the grains play an important role in producing the extinction .",
    "we also note that the extinction efficiency in the bump region for the composite grains obtained with emt deviate considerably from that obtained by dda .",
    "\\(2 ) the model extinction curves for the composite spheroidal grains with the axial ratio not very large ( @xmath8 , n=9640 ) and 10 % volume fractions of graphite inclusions are found to fit the average observed interstellar extinction satisfactorily .",
    "extinction curves with other composite grain models with n=25896 and 14440 also fit the observed extinction curve reasonably well , however these model curves deviate from the observed curves in the uv region , i.e. beyond about wavelength 1500  .",
    "these results indicate that a third component of very small particles in the composite grains may help improve the fit in the uv region ( see e.g. weingartner and draine 2001 ) .",
    "\\(3 ) the linear polarization curves obtained for the composite grain models with silicate as the host and very small volume fraction ( f=0.05 ) of graphite inclusions fit the serkowski curve ; which indicates that most of the polarization is produced by the silicate material ( see duley et . al . 1989 ; mathis & whiffen 1989 and wolf et .",
    "al . 1993 ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath9 for these composite spheroidal grains is also consistent with the observed values .",
    "\\(4 ) the volume extinction factor for the composite grain models with host silicate and graphite inclusions , is lower than that is obtained for the bare silicate / graphite grain models ( e.g. mathis et al . 1977 ) .",
    "these results clearly show that composite grain model is more efficient in producing the extinction and it would perhaps help to reduce the cosmic abundance constraints .",
    "perets and biham ( 2006 ) have recently noted that due to complexity of various processes , viz .",
    "grain - grain collisions and coagulation ; photolysis and alteration by uv radiation , x - rays and cosmic rays etc .",
    ", there is no complete model that accounts for all the relevant properties of the interstellar dust grains .",
    "we have used the composite spheroidal grain model to fit the observed interstellar extinction and linear polarization .",
    "the iras and cobe observations have indicated the importance of the ir emission as a constraint on interstellar dust models ( zubko et al .",
    "it would certainly strengthen the composite spheroidal grain model further , if it can fit the iras observations as well as cobe data on diffuse ir emission ( dwek 1997 ) .",
