    "stars ( like our sun ) exert not only gravitation , but also radiation pressure on bodies moving nearby . at the same time , it is well known that dust particles are characterized by a considerable sailing capacity ( cross - section to mass ratio ) , and hence are subject to a sizable effect of light pressure from the star , being one of the possible mechanisms for the formation and evolution of gas - dust clouds .",
    "therefore the study of motion of particles under photogravitation effect becomes realistic an important field of research .",
    "unfortunately the classical planar circular restricted three - body problem is not valid for investigating the motion of material points in the solar system where the third mass has considerable sailing capacity ( for example cosmic dust , stellar wind , etc ) .",
    "thus it is reasonable to modify the classical model by superposing a radiative repulsion field , whose source coincides with the source of the gravitational field ( the sun ) , onto the gravitational field of the main body .",
    "several modifications of the restricted three - body problem have been proposed for the study of the motion of a massless particle in the solar system ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these modifications include additional forces in the potential of the classical problem which may make it more realistic for certain applications .",
    "@xcite has stated that particles , such as small meteors or cosmic dust , are comparably affected by gravitational and light radiation forces as they approach luminous celestial bodies .",
    "the importance of the radiation influence on celestial bodies has been recognized by many scientists , especially in connection with the formation of concentrations of interplanetary and interstellar dust or grains in planetary and binary star systems , as well as the perturbations on artificial satellites .",
    "the term photo - gravitational restricted three - body problem was introduced by @xcite .",
    "this extended version of the classical restricted three - body problem takes into account only the radiation pressure component of the radiation drag , which is the next most powerful component after the gravitational forces .",
    "later , @xcite performed a complete treatment of the behavior of the equilibrium points . in both papers , however , radzievskii , who was primarily interested in the solar problem , only treated a limited range of radiation pressure parameters ( in particular when only one massive body is luminous ) and did not consider the question of the linear stability of the equilibrium points . moreover radzievskii investigated that besides five libration points of classical problem , there exist out - of - plane equilibrium points @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite extended his work by introducing the pointing - robertson effect .",
    "many authors ( i.e. , @xcite ) developed and extended this work to introduce more understandable issues related to the motion of particle in the field of radiating primaries .    in the previous years",
    "several authors have made studies on lagrangian points in the restricted three - body problem by considering the more massive primary or both primaries as source of radiation .",
    "some of the important contributions are by @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite investigated the linear stability of the triangular points in the planar case by considering the more massive primary as source of radiation and the smaller primary as oblate spheroid and found that the critical mass value decreases with the increase in radiation pressure .",
    "@xcite studied libration solutions of the photogravitational restricted three - body problem .",
    "recently @xcite studied the combined effects of perturbations due to coriolis forces , centrifugal forces , radiation pressure and oblateness on the linear stability of the triangular libration points .",
    "another interesting topic in the photogravitational restricted three - body problem is the computation of families of periodic orbits ( i.e. , @xcite . in the same vein ,",
    "@xcite have studied periodic orbits generated by lagrangian solutions of the restricted three - body problem when the bigger body is a source of radiation and the smaller is an oblate spheroid . at this point",
    "we should emphasize , that all the above - mentioned references on periodic orbits in the photogravitational restricted three - body problem are exemplary rather than exhaustive , taking into account that a vast quantity of related literature exists .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite we explored how the oblateness coefficient influences the orbital content in the restricted three - body problem . in this work",
    "we shall use this paper as a guide following the same numerical techniques in order to unveil how the radiation pressure factor affects the character of orbits in the photogravitational restricted three - body problem .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section [ mod ] we outline the properties of the considered mathematical model along with some necessary theoretical details .",
    "all the computational methods we used in order to determine the nature of the orbits are described in section [ cometh ] . in the following section , we conduct a thorough numerical investigation revealing the overall orbital structure ( bounded regions and basins of escape / collision ) of the system and how it is affected by the value of the radiation pressure with respect to the total orbital energy .",
    "our paper ends with section [ conc ] , where the discussion and the conclusions of this work are given .",
    "it would be very illuminating to recall the basic properties and some aspects of the planar circular photogravitational restricted three - body problem .",
    "the two primaries move on circular orbits with the same kepler frequency around their common center of gravity , which is assumed to be fixed at the origin of the coordinates .",
    "the third body ( test particle ) moves in the same plane under the gravitational field of the two primaries .",
    "the mass of the infinitesimal test body is supposed to be so small that it s influence on the motion of the primaries is negligible .",
    "we assume that the bigger primary is an intense emitter of radiation ( replicating the scenario of the solar system ) which contributes for the effect of radiation pressure , while the second smaller primary is not radiating .",
    "it should be pointed out that , in contrast to the classical three - body problem , in the photogravitational problem the force acting on the particle depends not only on the parameters of the radiating body ( temperature , size , density , etc ) but also on the parameters of the particle itself ( size , density , etc ) .    the photogravitational version of the restricted three - body problem is derived in a similar way to the classical problem @xcite .",
    "in fact , we adopt the notation and formulation used in @xcite .",
    "the units of length , mass and time are taken so that the sum of the masses , the distance between the primaries and the angular velocity is unity , which sets the gravitational constant @xmath4 .",
    "a rotating rectangular system whose origin is the center of mass of the primaries and whose @xmath5-axis contains the primaries is used .",
    "the mass parameter is @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the masses of the primaries with @xmath9 , such that @xmath10 . in our study",
    "we consider an intermediate value of the mass parameter , that is @xmath11 .",
    "this value remains constant throughout the paper .",
    "we have fixed the center of mass at ( 0,0 ) , while the centers @xmath12 and @xmath13 of the two primary bodies are located at @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the forces experienced by the test particle in the coordinate system rotating with angular velocity @xmath16 and origin at the center of the mass are according to @xcite derivable from the following total time - independent effective potential function @xmath17 where @xmath0 are the coordinates of the test particle , while @xmath18 @xmath19 are the position vectors from the larger and smaller primaries to the test particle , respectively .",
    "we decided not to include the oblateness coefficient thus considering both primaries as spherically symmetric bodies in order to focus our study on only one variable parameter @xmath20 which controls the intensity of the radiation .",
    "the parameter @xmath21 is the radiation pressure factor which is defined as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the ratio of the solar radiation pressure force @xmath24 to the gravitational attraction force @xmath25 of the bigger primary @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath21 is a reduction factor which depends on the size and the shape of the third body ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . for a general body , such as a planet , @xmath26 . for a small body on the other hand , such as an asteroid or a satellite , @xmath27 , while for extremely small objects ( i.e. , a dust grain ) it is possible that @xmath28 . in general terms",
    "the value of @xmath21 could be taken in the interval @xmath29 $ ] @xcite . in this work",
    "we restrict our investigation in the interval @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "the scaled equations of motion describing the motion of the test body in the dimensionless corotating frame read @xmath31 @xmath32 the dynamical system ( [ eqmot ] ) admits the well know jacobi integral @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the velocities , while @xmath36 is the jacobi constant which is conserved and defines a three - dimensional invariant manifold in the total four - dimensional phase space .",
    "thus , an orbit with a given value of it s energy integral is restricted in its motion to regions in which @xmath37 , while all other regions are forbidden to the test body .",
    "the value of the energy @xmath38 is related with the jacobi constant by @xmath39 .",
    "the dynamical system has five equilibria known as lagrangian points @xcite at which @xmath40 three of them , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , are collinear points located in the @xmath44-axis .",
    "the central stationary point @xmath41 is a local minimum of the potential function @xmath45 .",
    "the stationary points @xmath42 and @xmath43 are saddle points .",
    "let @xmath42 located at @xmath46 , while @xmath43 be at @xmath47 .",
    "the points @xmath48 and @xmath49 on the other hand , are local maxima of the gravitational potential , enclosed by the banana - shaped isolines .",
    "the lagrangian points are very important especially for astronautical applications .",
    "this can be seen in the sun - jupiter system where several thousand asteroids ( collectively referred to as trojan asteroids ) , are in orbits of equilibrium points . in practice",
    "these lagrangian points have proven to be very useful indeed since a spacecraft can be made to execute a small orbit about one of these equilibrium points with a very small expenditure of energy ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the position of the lagrangian points is actually a function of the radiation pressure factor @xmath21 . in fig .",
    "[ theor]a we show how the position of the collinear points @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 evolves with respect to the value of the radiation pressure factor @xmath21 .",
    "it is seen that the collinear points @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 come nearer to the radiating primary with the increase in the radiation pressure ( remember that the radiation pressure increases when the value of @xmath21 decreases ) .",
    "in particular it is found that the collinear points @xmath41 and @xmath43 coincide with the center of the radiating primary when @xmath50 . in the same vein ,",
    "@xcite studied the influence of the oblateness and the radiation pressure on angular frequencies at collinear points .",
    "the jacobi constant values at the lagrangian points @xmath51 are denoted by @xmath52 and are critical values ( note that @xmath53 ) .",
    "[ theor]b shows the evolution of the @xmath52 critical values as a function of the radiation pressure factor .",
    "we see that @xmath12 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 evolve very similarly , while @xmath13 exhibits a linear evolution .",
    "it is evident that @xmath12 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 tend to a common value when @xmath56 , or in other words , when the more massive primary body is an intense emitter of radiation .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath57 the values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 coincide , while @xmath58 for @xmath59 .",
    "the projection of the four - dimensional phase space onto the configuration ( or position ) space @xmath0 is called the hill s regions and is divided into three domains : ( i ) the interior region for @xmath60 ; ( ii ) the exterior region for @xmath61 and @xmath62 ; ( iii ) the forbidden regions .",
    "the boundaries of these hill s regions are called zero velocity curves ( zvcs ) because they are the locus in the configuration @xmath0 space where the kinetic energy vanishes .",
    "the structure of the hill s regions strongly depends on the value of the jacobi constant and also on the value of the radiation pressure factor .",
    "there are five distinct cases regarding the hill s regions :    * @xmath63 : all necks are closed , so there are only bounded and collisional basins .",
    "when @xmath64 and as the heavier primary becomes more and more radiating the allowed region around this primary is considerably reduced . *",
    "@xmath65 : when @xmath66 only the neck around @xmath41 is open thus allowing orbits to move around both primaries . for @xmath64",
    "the neck around @xmath41 is closed , while the neck around @xmath42 is open thus allowing orbits to escape from the interior region .",
    "* @xmath67 : the neck around @xmath42 is open , so orbits can enter the exterior region and escape form the system . for @xmath64 the area of the forbidden regions is much smaller than in the case when @xmath66 .",
    "in particular the forbidden regions when @xmath64 are surrounding the domain only around the radiating primary .",
    "* @xmath68 : the necks around both @xmath42 and @xmath43 are open , therefore orbits are free to escape through two different escape channels . * @xmath69 : the banana - shaped forbidden regions disappear ,",

    ". there are three possible types of motion for the test body : ( i ) bounded motion around one of the primaries , or even around both ; ( ii ) escape to infinity ; ( iii ) collision into one of the two primaries .",
    "now we need to define appropriate numerical criteria for distinguishing between these three types of motion .",
    "the motion is considered as bounded if the test body stays confined for integration time @xmath83 inside the system s disk with radius @xmath84 and center coinciding with the center of mass origin at @xmath85 .",
    "obviously , the higher the values of @xmath83 and @xmath84 the more plausible becomes the definition of bounded motion and in the limit @xmath86 the definition is the precise description of bounded motion in a finite disk of radius @xmath84 .",
    "consequently , the higher these two values , the longer the numerical integration of initial conditions of orbits lasts . in our calculations",
    "we choose @xmath87 and @xmath80 ( see fig . [ crit ] ) as in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we decided to include a relatively high disk radius @xmath88 in order to be sure that the orbits will certainly escape from the system and not return back to the interior region .",
    "furthermore , it should be emphasized that for low values of @xmath83 the fractal boundaries of stability islands corresponding to bounded motion become more smooth .",
    "moreover , an orbit is identified as escaping and the numerical integration stops if the test body intersects the system s disk with velocity pointing outwards at a time @xmath89 .",
    "finally , a collision with one of the primaries occurs if the test body , assuming it is a point mass , crosses the disk with radius @xmath90 around the primary . for the larger oblate primary we choose @xmath91 .",
    "generally , it is assumed that the radius of a celestial body ( e.g. , a planet ) is directly proportional to the cubic root of its mass .",
    "therefore , for the sake of simplicity of the numerical calculations we adopt the simple relation between the radii of the primaries @xmath92 which was introduced in @xcite . in @xcite it was shown that the radii of the primaries influence the area of collision and escape basins .",
    "as it was stated earlier , in our computations , we set @xmath93 time units as a maximum time of numerical integration .",
    "the vast majority of escaping orbits ( regular and chaotic ) however , need considerable less time to escape from the system ( obviously , the numerical integration is effectively ended when an orbit moves outside the system s disk and escapes ) .",
    "nevertheless , we decided to use such a vast integration time just to be sure that all orbits have enough time in order to escape .",
    "remember , that there are the so called  sticky orbits \" which behave as regular ones during long periods of time . here",
    "we should clarify , that orbits which do not escape after a numerical integration of @xmath93 time units are considered as non - escaping or trapped .",
    "the equations of motion ( [ eqmot ] ) for the initial conditions of all orbits are forwarded integrated using a double precision bulirsch - stoer ` fortran 77 ` algorithm ( e.g. , @xcite ) with a small time step of order of @xmath94 , which is sufficient enough for the desired accuracy of our computations .",
    "here we should emphasize , that our previous numerical experience suggests that the bulirsch - stoer integrator is both faster and more accurate than a double precision runge - kutta - fehlberg algorithm of order 7 with cash - karp coefficients . throughout all our computations , the jacobian energy integral ( eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) ) was conserved better than one part in @xmath95 , although for most orbits it was better than one part in @xmath96 . for collisional orbits where the test body moves inside a region of radius @xmath94 around one of the primaries the lemaitre s global regularization method",
    "is applied .",
    "the main numerical task is to classify initial conditions of orbits in the @xmath76 part instead of the @xmath77 part simply because in @xcite we seen that it contains more interesting orbital content .",

    "moreover , two additional properties of the orbits will be examined : ( i ) the time - scale of collision and ( ii ) the time - scale of the escapes ( we shall also use the terms escape period or escape rates ) . in this work",
    "we shall explore these dynamical quantities for various values of the total orbital energy , as well as for the radiation pressure factor @xmath21 .",
    "in particular , we choose four energy levels which correspond to the last four hill s regions configurations .",
    "the first hill s regions configuration contain only bounded and collisional orbits around the two primaries , so the orbital content is not so interesting .    at this point",
    "we would like to clarify how the initial conditions of orbits are generated in the @xmath76 part of the surface of section @xmath75 .",
    "the conditions @xmath76 and @xmath75 in polar coordinates along with the existence of the jacobi integral of motion ( [ ham ] ) suggest that the four initial conditions of orbits in cartesian coordinates are @xmath97 where @xmath98 . in the following color - coded grids ( or orbit type diagrams - otds )",
    "each pixel is assigned a color according to the orbit type .",
    "thus the initial conditions of orbits on the @xmath0-plane are classified into bounded orbits , unbounded or escaping orbits and collisional orbits . in this special type of poincar surface of section ( pss )",
    "the phase space emerges as a close and compact mix of escape basins , collisional basins and stability regions .",
    "our numerical calculations indicate that apart from the escaping and collisional orbits there is also a considerable amount of non - escaping orbits . in general terms",
    ", the majority of non - escaping regions corresponds to initial conditions of regular orbits , where an adelphic integral of motion is present , restricting their accessible phase space and therefore hinders their escape .    in the following we are going to explore the orbital content of the configuration @xmath0 space in three different cases regarding the intensity of the radiation of the more massive primary body . in every case",
    "we choose such values of the jacobi constant @xmath36 so that the shape of the hill s region configuration to be similar , as much as possible , in all three cases under consideration .",
    "our first case under investigation concerns a low radiating primary where the radiation pressure factor is @xmath70 . in fig .",

    "the stability islands located in the interior region correspond to regular orbits around one of the primary bodies , while the stability island in the exterior region is formed by initial conditions of regular orbits that circulate around both primaries ; ( ii ) the region in the boundaries of the stability islands of the interior region is mainly occupied by orbits which lead to collision .",
    "moreover , the collision basin around primary 2 ( non radiating ) is stronger than that around primary 1 ; ( iii ) near the center of primary 1 we can identify a small hole which contains a mixture of collisional and bounded orbits ; ( iv ) outside the forbidden region there is a well - formed circular basin of escaping orbits . when @xmath100 the neck around @xmath42 opens and therefore initial conditions of escaping orbits emerge in the interior region .",

    "we are able to associate medium escape time with the stable manifold of a non - attracting chaotic invariant set , which is spread out throughout this region of the chaotic sea , while the largest escape time values on the other hand , are linked with sticky motion around the stability islands of the two primary bodies . as for the collisional time we see that a small portion of orbits with initial conditions very close to the vicinity of the centers of the primaries collide with them almost immediately , within the first time steps of the numerical integration . looking more carefully fig .",

    "there is a stability island , the usual hole and a ring - shaped collisional basin . in the exterior region we identified initial conditions of orbits that collide to primary 2 , while collisional orbits to primary 1 do not have initial conditions in the exterior region .",
    "when the forbidden regions break into two symmetrical parts for @xmath111 we observe in fig .",
    "[ rh]c that the orbital structure around primary 1 remains almost the same , while the thin spiral collisional basins to primary 2 are still present in the exterior region .",
    "however now several initial conditions of orbits that collide to primary 1 are present as scattered lonely points in the exterior region . finally in fig .",
    "[ rh]d where @xmath112 one can see that at the right side of the center of radiating primary 1 there is also a second smaller stability island .",
    "furthermore , now the collisional orbits to primary 1 form collisional basins in the exterior region , while the collisional basins to primary 2 seem to weaken .    in fig .",
    "[ rht ] we depict the distribution of the escape and collisional times of orbits on the configuration space .",
    "one can see similar outcomes with that presented in the two previous subsections . at this point",
    ", we would like to emphasize that the basins of escape can be easily distinguished in fig .",
    "[ rht ] , being the regions with intermediate colors indicating fast escaping orbits . indeed",
    ", our numerical computations suggest that orbits with initial conditions inside these basins need no more than 10 time units in order to escape from the system .",
    "furthermore , the collisional basins are shown with reddish colors where the corresponding collisional time is less than one time unit of numerical integration .",
    "we observe that the second stability island at the right side of the primary 1 it emerges rather quickly from the third type of hill s region configurations .",
    "it should be also noted that the area of the stability island around primary 2 decreases with decreasing @xmath36 or increasing value of the total orbital energy .",
    "the otds shown in figs .",
    "[ rl ] , [ rm ] and [ rh ] have both fractal and non - fractal ( smooth ) boundary regions which separate the escape basins from the collisional basins .",
    "such fractal basin boundaries is a common phenomenon in leaking hamiltonian systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the photogravitational rtbp system",
    "the leakages are defined by both escape and collision conditions thus resulting in three exit modes .",
    "however , due to the high complexity of the basin boundaries , it is very difficult , or even impossible , to predict in these regions whether the test body ( e.g. , a satellite , asteroid , planet etc ) collides with one of the primary bodies or escapes from the dynamical system .       as a function of the value of the jacobi constant @xmath36 . ]",
    "the color - coded otds in the configuration @xmath0 space provide sufficient information on the phase space mixing however , for only a fixed value of the jacobi constant ( or the total orbital energy ) and also for orbits that traverse the surface of section retrogradely .",
    "hnon @xcite , introduced a new type of plane which can provide information not only about stability and chaotic regions but also about areas of bounded and unbounded motion using the section @xmath113 , @xmath114 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in other words , all the initial conditions of the orbits of the test particles are launched from the @xmath44-axis with @xmath115 , parallel to the @xmath116-axis @xmath117 .",
    "consequently , in contrast to the previously discussed types of planes , only orbits with pericenters on the @xmath44-axis are included and therefore , the value of the jacobi constant @xmath36 can now be used as an ordinate . in this way , we can monitor how the energy influences the overall orbital structure of our dynamical system using a continuous spectrum of jacobi constants rather than few discrete values . in fig .",
    "[ xc](a - d ) we present the orbital structure of the @xmath1 plane for four values of the radiation pressure factor when @xmath118 $ ] , while in fig .",
    "[ xct](a - d ) the distribution of the corresponding escape and collision times of the orbits is depicted . the black solid line in fig .",
    "[ xc](a - d ) is the limiting curve which distinguishes between regions of allowed and forbidden motion and is defined as @xmath119    we can observe the presence of several types of regular orbits around the two primary bodies . being more precise , on both sides of the primaries we identify stability islands corresponding to both direct ( counterclockwise ) and retrograde ( clockwise ) quasi - periodic orbits .",
    "it is seen that a large portion of the exterior region , that is for @xmath61 and @xmath62 , a large portion of the @xmath1 plane is covered by initial conditions of escaping orbits however , at the left - hand side of the same plane two stability islands of regular orbits that circulate around both primaries are observed .",
    "additional numerical calculations reveal that for much lower values of @xmath44 @xmath120 these two stability islands are joined and form a crescent - like shape .",
    "we also see that collisional basins to radiating primary 1 leak outside the interior region , mainly outside @xmath43 , and create complicated spiral shapes in the exterior region . on the other hand , the thin bands represent initial conditions of orbits that collide with primary body 2 are much more confined .",
    "it should be pointed out that in the blow - ups of the diagrams several additional very small islands of stability have been identified .    as the value of the radiation pressure factor decreases ( which means that the radiation of the primary body increases ) the structure of the @xmath1 planes exhibits the following changes : ( i ) the collisional basins to radiating primary 1 gradually weakens ; ( ii ) the area of the stability islands around primary 1 reduces .",
    "according to broucke s classification @xcite the periodic orbits around the primaries belong to the families @xmath36 ( at the left side of the primary ) and @xmath121 ( at the right side of the primary ) , while @xcite proved for the planar hill s problem that the stability regions of the @xmath36 family are more stable than those of the @xmath121 family ; ( iii ) the stability islands around primary body 2 are almost unperturbed , at least in the interval @xmath122 $ ] , by the decrease on the value of the radiation pressure factor .",
    "the phenomenon that stability islands can appear and disappear as a dynamical parameter is changed has also been reported in earlier paper ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; ( iv ) the collisional basins to primary 2 increases as the value of the radiation pressure factor decreases ; ( vi ) the two stability islands in the exterior region come closer as the intensity of the radiation of primary 1 increases ; ( vii ) another interesting phenomenon is the fact that as the intensity of the radiation of primary body 1 increases the fractality of the @xmath1 plane reduces and the boundaries between escaping and collisional basins appear to become smoother .",
    "it should be emphasized that the fractality of the structures was not measured by computing the corresponding fractal dimension .",
    "when we state that an area is fractal we mean that it has a fractal - like geometry .    it would be very informative to monitor the evolution of the percentages of the different types of orbits as a function of the jacobi constant @xmath36 for the @xmath1 planes shown in figs .",
    "[ xc](a - d ) .",
    "our results are presented in figs .",
    "[ pxc](a - d ) .",
    "we see that in all four cases the percentages display similar patterns , so we are going to explain only the first case shown in fig .",
    "[ pxc]a where @xmath70 . for @xmath123",
    "escaping orbits cover all the available space however their rate gradually reduces until about 45% for @xmath124 . for @xmath125",
    "it suddenly increases and in the interval @xmath126 $ ] escaping orbits dominate with rates above 80% .",
    "the evolution of the percentage of regular bounded orbits displays an exact opposite evolution with respect to the pattern of escaping orbits .",
    "in particular , in the interval @xmath126 $ ] the percentage of regular orbits fluctuate at relatively low values below 12% , while for @xmath127 and @xmath128 on the other hand , two peaks are observed at about 55% and 75% , respectively .",
    "the percentages of collisional orbits to primaries 1 and 2 have a monotone behaviour with almost zero values for @xmath127 and @xmath129 , while in the interval @xmath130 $ ] their rates fluctuate at extremely low values below 5% .",
    "thus we may argue that the most interesting interval of values of the jacobi constant @xmath36 is the interval @xmath130 $ ] . inspecting all four sub - panels",
    "it becomes evident that this particular interval becomes smaller and smaller as the value of the radiation pressure factor decreases and the intensity of the radiation of the more massive primary becomes stronger .",
    "therefore one may reasonably conclude that the radiation pressure factor practically does not drastically affect the actual percentages of the different types of orbits .",
    "all it does is to shift the energy intervals at which the different patterns appear .",
    "another interesting aspect would be to reveal how the radiation pressure factor @xmath21 influences the escape as well as the collision time of orbits . the evolution of the average value of the escape time @xmath131 of orbits as a function of the value of the jacobi constant @xmath36 is given in fig .",
    "it is evident , especially in the energy interval @xmath132 $ ] , that as the value of the radiation pressure decreases the escape rates of orbits are reduced . in the same vein in fig .",
    "[ tcol]a we present the evolution of the average collision time @xmath133 of orbits that collide to the radiating primary 1 .",
    "once more we observe that the collision time of orbits in general terms decreases with decreasing value of @xmath21 .",
    "additional numerical calculations , shown in fig .",
    "[ tcol]b , indicate that the radiation pressure factor also influences the collision rates of orbits which collide to non - radiating primary 2 . in particular , in the range",
    "@xmath134 $ ] the collision rates to primary 2 are reduced with decreasing @xmath21 .    before closing this section",
    "we would like to add that the particular value of the mass ratio @xmath135 does not really change the qualitative nature of the numerical outcomes presented in this section . indeed after conducting some additional calculations with larger and lower values of @xmath135 we concluded to the same results .",
    "the parameters which mostly influence the orbital dynamics are the total orbital energy and of course the radiation pressure factor .",
    "the main scope of this numerical investigation was to unveil how the radiation pressure factor influences the character of orbits in the classical planar circular photogravitational restricted three - body problem .",
    "after conducting an extensive and thorough numerical investigation we managed to distinguish between bounded , escaping and collisional orbits and we also located the basins of escape and collision , finding also correlations with the corresponding escape and collision times .",
    "our numerical results strongly suggest that the radiation pressure factor plays a very important role in the nature of the test s body motion under the gravitational field of the two primaries . to our knowledge , this is the first detailed and systematic numerical analysis on the influence of the radiation pressure factor on the character of orbits and this is exactly the novelty and the contribution of the current work .    for several values of the radiation pressure factor in the last four hill",
    "s regions configurations we defined dense uniform grids of @xmath78 initial conditions regularly distributed on the @xmath76 part of the configuration @xmath0 plane inside the area allowed by the value of the jacobi constant ( or in other words by the value of the total orbital energy ) .",
    "all orbits were launched with initial conditions inside the scattering region , which in our case was a square grid with @xmath79 . for the numerical integration of the orbits in each type of grid , we needed about between 12 hours and 6 days of cpu time on a pentium dual - core 2.2 ghz pc , depending on the escape and collisional rates of orbits in each case .",
    "for each initial condition , the maximum time of the numerical integration was set to be equal to @xmath93 time units however , when a particle escaped or collided with one of the two primaries the numerical integration was effectively ended and proceeded to the next available initial condition .    in this study",
    "we provide quantitative information regarding the escape and collisional dynamics in the photogravitational restricted three - body problem .",
    "the main outcomes of our numerical research can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we found that for @xmath64 when the neck around @xmath42 is open , the throat around @xmath41 is still closed .",
    "for very low values of the radiation pressure factor the allowed area of motion around the center of the more massive primary is very small , while when the throat around @xmath41 opens the banana - shaped forbidden regions surround only the radiating primary .",
    "it was observed that as the value of the radiation pressure factor decreases the area of the stability islands around primary 1 is reduced , while the area of the stability islands around non - radiating primary 2 remains almost unperturbed .",
    "as the radiation pressure of primary 1 increases the initial conditions in the exterior region of collisional orbits to primary 1 appear only at relatively low values of the jacobi constant , or in other words at high values of the total orbital energy . at the same time the collisional basins to primary 2 in the exterior region weaken with reducing @xmath36 .",
    "it was detected that the collisional basins to primary 1 are reduced with decreasing value of the radiation pressure factor , while the collisional basins to primary 2 are strengthened as the intensity of the radiation pressure increases .",
    "we presented numerical evidence that the radiation pressure factor also influences the escape as well as the collision average time of the orbits .",
    "in particular , both types of average times are reduced as the value of the value of the radiation pressure factor decreases .",
    "our calculations reveal that as the primary body 1 becomes more and more radiating the fractality of the planes is reduced and the boundaries between the bounded , escape and collisional basins appear to become smoother .",
    "judging by the detailed and novel outcomes we may say that our task has been successfully completed . we hope that the present numerical analysis and the corresponding results to be useful in the field of escape dynamics in the photogravitational restricted three - body problem .",
    "the results as well as the conclusions of the present research are considered , as an initial effort and also as a promising step in the task of understanding the escape mechanism of orbits in this interesting version of the classical three - body problem .",
    "taking into account that our outcomes are encouraging , it is in our future plans to properly modify our dynamical model in order to expand our investigation into three dimensions and explore the entire six - dimensional phase thus revealing the influence of the radiation pressure factor on the orbital structure .",
