    "random matrix theory was first introduced in biostatistics by wishart  @xcite and later on also by wigner in the context of hamiltonian systems  @xcite .",
    "it has extraordinary power to model and study generic features in a variety of systems , see ref .",
    "it only employs basis invariance and global symmetries of the matrices resulting in the orthogonal , unitary and symplectic ensembles  @xcite .",
    "wishart s ideas opened a new direction in time series analysis and statistical inference  @xcite .",
    "the wishart model is widley used , including applications in fields such as medicine  @xcite , biophysics@xcite , chemistry@xcite , finance  @xcite , wireless communication  @xcite , to mention just a few .",
    "the wishart model shares the unique advantage of all random matrix approaches : most of its predictions are accessible in experiments or observations and can therefore directly be tested .",
    "although the random matrix theory setup is straightforward , calculations are often difficult . the real case which is the most relevant one for applications is particularly cumbersome .",
    "we thus focus on the case of @xmath1 rectangular matrices @xmath2 with real entries @xmath3 for @xmath4 and @xmath5",
    ". the @xmath6 rows of @xmath2 may be viewed as model time series of length @xmath7 .",
    "we assume a gaussian distribution  @xcite , @xmath8 where the @xmath9 matrix @xmath10 is the empirical correlation matrix specific for the data under consideration . this matrix is input of the model and requires to be real symmetric with positive eigenvalues @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "in particular we have @xmath13 with @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the positive definite @xmath9 matrix @xmath16 is the model correlation matrix and due to our choice of @xmath17 , it is on average @xmath18 .    in applications of the real wishart model , correlated or not , square roots of characteristic polynomials and therefore branch cuts arise .",
    "for instance , gap probabilities related to the smallest and largest eigenvalue were found to possess a representation as averaged products of determinants in the denominator to half integer power  @xcite .",
    "other examples are the eigenvalue density in the ordinary and doubly correlated wishart model  @xcite , the distribution of the smallest eigenvalue  @xcite as well as universality considerations in scattering theory  @xcite .",
    "those square roots are serious obstacles in analytical calculations and a solution is urgently called for . to the best of our knowledge",
    "a comprehensive analytical strategy for averages over a product of characteristic polynomials to half integer power does not exist .",
    "for certain special cases some solutions are known  @xcite .",
    "the analytical calculations drastically simplify in the case that the empirical correlation matrix becomes doubly degenerate , because the square roots are not present anymore .",
    "although this case is empirically rarely justified , our results provide very good approximations for the case without such degeneracies . our main goal is a general approach to eigenvalue statistics in the real correlated wishart model , which to some extent outmanoeuvers the square roots of characteristic polynomials such that standard random matrix techniques apply .",
    "based on analytical calculations using supersymmetry  @xcite and on numerical simulations we verify that most of the statistical properties in the bulk , at the edges and for the outliers of an arbitrary , correlated real wishart ensemble do not depend on the degree of the degeneracy of the empirical correlation matrix .",
    "in particular , the spectral observables of a @xmath1 random matrix @xmath2 correlated with @xmath10 coincide with those of a @xmath19 random matrix correlated with @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the degree of degeneracy and @xmath22 is the @xmath23-dimensional identity matrix .",
    "this statement becomes exact for @xmath24 under very moderate assumptions on the empirical correlation matrix @xmath10 .",
    "the eigenvalue density of correlated wishart ensembles with non - degenerate spectrum was already studied by many other in @xcite .",
    "we will regain their results and additionally we derive results about the local spectral statistics .    as a by ",
    "product we also derive the sine and the airy kernel for real matrices in the bulk and at the soft edges , respectively , for the fully correlated case .",
    "importantly , we properly account for all efetov  wegner boundary contributions  @xcite which often pose substantial difficulties in supersymmetry calculations . to this end",
    "we apply rothstein s theory  @xcite and identify the results with those for the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) .",
    "we include outliers and discuss their positions and fluctuations , provided they are well  separated from all other eigenvalues .",
    "we show that most of the spectral observables are independent of the degree of degeneracy , and we thus claim that the distributions of the largest eigenvalue for the correlated real wishart ensembles with the empirical correlation matrices @xmath10 and @xmath25 are approximately equal in the limit of large matrix dimensions @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "we derive a representation of the cumulative density function in terms of a @xmath9 pfaffian ( @xmath6 even ) for the @xmath26 wishart ensemble with @xmath25 . for this purpose",
    "we start from an earlier result  @xcite and employ skew ",
    "orthogonal polynomials  @xcite .",
    "although the results are derived in an asymptotic limit , we find surprisingly good agreement with numerical simulations already for rather small matrix dimensions .",
    "this allows a quantitative as well as a qualitative spectral analysis in the wishart model without doublely degenerate empirical eigenvalues if @xmath27 and @xmath28 large .",
    "our study is structured as follows . in section  [ superrep ] ,",
    "we summarize the basics of the @xmath0-point function and present the corresponding supermatrix model .",
    "we also discuss the conditions on @xmath10 to ensure that the limit @xmath29 with @xmath30 $ ] is well  defined .",
    "the saddle point approximation of the supermatrix model is performed in section  [ sec : bulk ] in which we also derive a simple general relation between the macroscopic level density ( marginal density ) and the saddle point solution .",
    "furthermore , we study the bulk and the edges of the spectrum and derive the sine kernel on the local scale . in section",
    "[ sec : saddlepoint - edge ] we investigate possible outliers and the local statistics of the soft edges and derive the airy kernel .",
    "we also manage to express the cumulative distribution of the largest eigenvalue in terms of a pfaffian determinant . for illustrating purpose and to confirm our claims , we perform numerical simulations in section  [ numerics ] .",
    "we conclude in section  [ conclusion ] .",

    "we unfold the spectrum with the level density which depends on the empirical eigenvalues @xmath35 .",
    "importantly , on the original and on the unfolded scale , all @xmath0point functions may depend non  trivially on these empirical eigenvalues .",
    "one of the main results to be derived below is the emergence of the universal statistical features of the _ uncorrelated _ wishart ensemble after unfolding and under modest conditions on @xmath36 .",
