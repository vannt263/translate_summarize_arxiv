    "the time evolution of the chemical abundances in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , field stars , and globular clusters ( gcs ) of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) contains valuable information on its long - term star formation history and thus has been investigated in detail by many authors ( e.g. , da costa 1991 ; olszewski et al . 1991 ; russel & dopita 1992 ; dopita et al .",

    "2005 , c05 ; cioni et al . 2006 ) . the elemental abundance ratios of @xmath12 ( @xmath12 means alpha - elements ) , fe - peak , and neutron - capture elements in field stars and gcs of the lmc have been extensively investigated by spectroscopic observations .",
    "the observed differences in the abundance ratios between the lmc and the galaxy have been discussed in detail ( e.g. , hill et al .",
    "1995 , 2000 ; johnson et al .",
    "the radial and azimuthal variations of stellar metallicities in the the lmc disk has been investigated both observationally and theoretically in terms of its star formation and dynamical evolution histories ( geisler et al .",
    "2003 ; bekki & chiba 2005 ; cioni et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "one of the importance results in these previous studies is that the observed age  metallicity relation ( amr ) is more consistent with a model with a secondary `` starburst '' about a few gyr ago in the lmc ( e.g. , tsujimoto et al .",
    "1995 , t95 ; pt98 ) .",
    "although the possible presence of a past starburst ( or significantly enhanced star formation ) has long been discussed in other observational studies ( e.g. , butcher 1977 ; stryker 1983 ; bica et al .",
    "1986 ; bertelli et al .",

    "1998 , 1999 ; olsen 1999 ; smecker - hane et al . 2002 ; glatt et al . 2010 ; indu & subramaniam 2011 ) , the epoch and the strength of the burst were not well constrained .",
    "furthermore , owing to the lack of modern chemical evolution models with the latest chemical yields of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars and supernovae , it remained unclear how the long - term star formation history with a possible starburst could be imprinted on the detailed elemental abundance ratios of field stars and gcs in the lmc .",
    "recent photometric and spectroscopic observations of field stars and gcs have provided new clues for these unresolved problems in the lmc .",
    "for example , photometric studies of the stellar populations in the lmc have revealed the amrs of different local regions in the lmc disk ( e.g. , harris & zaritsky 2009 , hz09 ; rubele et al .",
    "2012 , r12 ) .",
    "the amr derived by hz09 show enhanced star formation rates of the lmc around 2 gyr , 500 myr , 100 myr , and 12 myr with the two peaks ( 500 myr and 2 gyr ) being nearly coincident with the star formation peaks observed in the smc .",
    "piatti ( 2011 ) has also shown that there was a burst of cluster formation around 2 gyr in the lmc and suggested that the lmc experienced strong tidal interaction with the smc and possibly with the galaxy .",
    "using deep near - infrared data from the vista near - infrared yjk@xmath13 survey of the magellanic system , r12 derived the star formation histories of different local regions in the lmc disk .",
    "they revealed the presence of peaks in sfrs around 3 gyr and 5 gyr ago for most of the subregions .",
    "glatt et al .",
    "( 2010 ) have recently found an enhanced cluster formation at 125 myr and 800 myr ago in their 324 populous star clusters for the lmc .",
    "furthermore , recent spectroscopic observations of field stars and gcs in the lmc have revealed intriguing chemical properties of the lmc ( e.g. , mucciarelli et al .",
    "2008 , pompia et al .",
    "2008 , p08 ; colucci et al .",
    "2012 , c12 , haschke et al .",
    "mucciarelli et al .",
    "( 2008 ) have shown that all four of the intermediate - age gcs which they investigated in the lmc have negligible star - to - star scatter in their chemical abundances of light , @xmath12 , iron - peak and neutron - capture elements .",
    "this implies that secondary star formation from gaseous ejecta of stars within the gcs did not occur so that the chemical abundances might be similar between intermediate - age field stars and clusters .",
    "p08 have found that [ ca / fe ] and [ si / fe ] in the lmc stars are lower than those of the galactic stars at the same [ fe / h ] whereas the [ o / fe ] and [ mg / fe ] are only slightly deficient in comparison with their galactic counterparts . c12",
    "have revealed the age - dependence of [ @xmath12/fe ] and [ fe / h ] among globular / star clusters with ages between 0.05 and 12 gyr and the significant enhancement of the neutron - capture elements ba , la , nd , sm , and eu in the youngest star clusters . the origin of these recent observational results has not yet been treated by chemical evolution models .    in spite of this progress in observational studies of the stellar populations of the lmc , theoretical models to explain the observations have not yet been fully developed .",
    "t95 tried to explain the observed [ o / fe][fe / h ] relation , the metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) , and the amr in a self - consistent manner by adopting a model in which the lmc had a starburst about 3 gyr ago and a steeper initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "they explained these observations , though the observational data points are much smaller than those that we can now access .",
    "pilyugin ( 1996 ) demonstrated that the observed [ fe / o ] versus [ fe / h ] relation can be reproduced only by the galactic wind model in which stellar ejecta can be preferentially expelled from the lmc .",
    "pt98 explained the observed amr and chemical abundance patterns of the lmc by considering `` non - selective stellar wind '' models in which some fraction of the stellar ejecta both from agb stars and sne can be expelled completely from the lmc and consequently can not participate in the chemical enrichment processes .",
    "these previous chemical evolution models did not incorporate the delay time distribution ( dtd ) of type ia supernova ( sne ia ) recently revealed by extensive sn ia surveys ( e.g. , mannucci et al .",
    "2006 ; sullivan et al .",
    "2006 ; totani et al . 2008 ; maoz et al .",
    "2010 ) and thus might not be regarded as realistic and reasonable .",
    "the construction of more sophisticated and realistic models is indispensable for discussing the above mentioned latest observational results .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to adopt a new chemical evolution model and thereby discuss the latest observational results on the chemical evolution and star formation history of the lmc .",
    "the observed dtd of sne ia is adopted in the new model so that the progenitor stars of sne ia can explode as early as @xmath14yr after their formation .",
    "these `` prompt sne ia '' can cause fundamental differences in the chemical evolution between the present model and previous ones ( e.g. , t95 ) in which the time delay between star formation and explosion of sne ia is assumed to be typically @xmath15 yr ( `` classical sne ia '' ) .",
    "the new model also incorporates the metallicity dependent chemical yields of agb stars ( e.g. , busso et al .",
    "2001 ; tsujimoto & bekki 2012 ; tb12 ) so that the chemical evolution of @xmath16-process elements can be investigated and compared with the observations .",
    "the new model is the so - called `` one - zone '' model , in which the time evolution of averaged chemical properties can be investigated .",
    "we explore a wide range of models with and without starburst and different star formation histories in the lmc so that we can discuss recent new observational results on different chemical properties of the lmc disk stars .",
    "for example , we will discuss ( i ) whether and how the previous starburst(s ) triggered by the lmc  smc",
    " galaxy interaction can be imprinted on the chemical abundance properties of the lmc , ( ii ) how the imf can control the chemical evolution , and ( iii ) how the accretion of metal - poor gas from the smc or high velocity clouds onto the lmc ( bekki & chiba 2007 , bc07 ; diaz & bekki 2012 , db12 ; bekki & tsujimoto 2010 ) influences the chemical evolution .",
    "it is timely to discuss the chemical evolution of the lmc in the context of the galaxy ",
    "smc tidal interaction , given that recent observational and theoretical studies have demonstrated that the tidal interaction is important not only for the star formation history of the lmc but also for the stellar and gaseous distributions of the magellanic system ( e.g. , olsen et al . 2011 ; db12 ) .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in  2 , we describe our new one - zone chemical evolution models in detail . in  3 , we present the results of the time evolution of the chemical abundances for models with different parameters . in  4",
    ", we discuss the results in the context of the imf , the long - term star formation history , and the gas accretion events in the lmc .",
    "the conclusions of the present study are given in  5 .",
    "we adopt one - zone chemical evolution models that are essentially the same as those adopted in our previous studies on the chemical evolution of the galaxy ( tsujimoto et al . 2009 ; tb12 ) .",
    "accordingly , we briefly describe the adopted models in the present study .",
    "the present model is improved in comparison with previous ones ( tsujimoto et al .",
    "2009 ) in terms of including the @xmath16-process elements and prompt snia self - consistently in the models .",
    "the lmc disk is assumed to form through a continuous gas infall from outside the disk region ( e.g. , halo ) for the last 13 gyr , as in previous chemical evolution models ( e.g. , tsujimoto et al .",
    "some fraction of gas with metals can be expelled from the lmc as stellar winds through energetic feedback effects of sne in some models of the present study ( e.g. , `` wind models '' , as described later ) .",
    "the star formation can be suddenly and significantly enhanced ( referred to as `` bursts of star formation '' or `` starburst '' ) . as demonstrated by theoretical studies , the galaxy  lmc ",
    "smc tidal interaction is important both for the formation of the magellanic stream and for reproducing the observed peaks of star formation in the lmc ( e.g. , bekki & chiba 2005 ; db12 ) .",
    "therefore , the adopted assumption of starburst is quite reasonable .",
    "although the infall of metal - poor gas from the smc and other dwarf galaxies can be important for the lmc chemical evolution , we discuss this later in  4 .",
    "we investigate the time evolution of the gas mass fraction ( @xmath17 ) , the star formation rate ( @xmath18 ) , and the abundance of the @xmath19th heavy element ( @xmath20 ) for a given accretion rate ( @xmath21 ) , imf , and ejection rate of ism ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the basic equations for the adopted one - zone chemical evolution models are described as follows : @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the mass fraction locked up in dead stellar remnants and long - lived stars , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are the chemical yields for the @xmath19th element from type ii supernovae ( sn ii ) , from sn ia , and from agb stars , respectively , @xmath29 is the abundance of heavy elements contained in the infalling gas , and @xmath30 is the wind rate for each element .",
    "the quantities @xmath31 and @xmath32 represent the time delay between star formation and sn ia explosion and that between star formation and the onset of agb phase , respectively .",
    "the terms @xmath33 ) and @xmath34 are the distribution functions of sne ia and agb stars , respectively , and the details of which are described later in this section .",
    "the term @xmath34 controls how much agb ejecta can be returned into the ism per unit mass for a given time in equation ( 2 ) .",
    "the total gas masses ejected from agb stars depends on the original masses of the agb stars ( e.g. , weidemann 2000 ) .",
    "therefore , this term @xmath34 depends on the adopted imf and the age  mass relation of the stars ( later described ) .",
    "thus equation ( 1 ) describes the time evolution of the gas due to star formation , gas accretion , and stellar wind .",
    "equation 2 describes the time evolution of the chemical abundances due to chemical enrichment by supernovae and agb stars .",
    "the star formation rate @xmath18 is assumed to be proportional to the gas fraction with a constant star formation coefficient and thus is described as follows : @xmath35 we assume that @xmath36 is different between ( i ) the `` quiescent phase '' , when the lmc shows an almost steady star formation , and ( ii ) the `` burst phase '' , when the lmc experienced a burst of star formation . in the present study , we investigate models with no burst ( referred to as `` standard models '' ) and those in which a starburst can occur only once ( `` burst models '' ) and twice ( `` double - burst models '' ) .",
    "the star formation rate is assumed to be constantly higher for @xmath37 in the first starburst and @xmath38 in the second one . the star formation coefficient ( @xmath36 ) is thus described as follows :    @xmath39    in the present study , a non - dimensional value of @xmath36 is given for each model .    for the accretion rate",
    ", we adopt the formula in which @xmath40 and @xmath41 is a free parameter controlling the time scale of the gas accretion . the normalization factor",
    "@xmath42 is determined such that the total gas mass accreted onto the lmc can be 1 for a given @xmath41 .",
    "although we investigated models with different @xmath41 , we finally adopt the models with @xmath43 gyr as reasonable ones for the lmc .",
    "this is mainly because the models with @xmath43 gyr can better explain the observations .",
    "the present results do not depend strongly on the parameter @xmath41 for a reasonable parameter range .",
    "the initial [ fe / h ] of the infalling gas is set to be @xmath44 and we assume a sn - ii like enhanced [ @xmath12/fe ] ratio ( e.g. , [ mg / fe]@xmath45 ) and [ ba / fe ] for the gas .",
    "this adoption of initial [ fe / h ] is reasonable for the present study which discusses stars with [ fe / h ] as low as @xmath44 .",
    "also , such adoption has been done in other chemical evolution models ( e.g. , tsujimoto et al .",
    "we discuss our parameter study for the above variables in  2.5 .",
    "we investigate models in which metals from agb stars and sne can be removed from the lmc through energetic stellar winds so that they can not be used for chemical enrichment of the lmc ism .",
    "these models are referred to as `` wind models '' for convenience .",
    "the wind models are further divided into two categories : `` selective wind models '' and `` non - selective wind models '' .",
    "only sne ejecta ( not already existing ism ) can be expelled from the lmc in the selective wind model , whereas both ejecta from sne and agb stars and already existing ism can be expelled from the lmc in the non - selective wind model . for comparison",
    ", we also investigate models in which there is no stellar wind and thus gaseous ejecta from all stars can be fully mixed with the ism ( `` non - wind models '' ) .    in the selective wind models ,",
    "some fraction , @xmath46 , of gaseous ejecta from sne can be mixed with ism for chemical enrichment processes whereas all agb ejecta can be mixed with ism .",
    "therefore , the wind rate @xmath22 is estimated only from the total mass of gaseous ejecta from sne @xmath47 at each time step .",
    "the total mass , @xmath48 , of ism that is removed from the lmc at each time step in the selective wind models is @xmath49    in the non - selective wind models , we adopt the same model as that used in pt98 in which @xmath50 is determined solely by the star formation rate : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a parameter ( in simulation units ) that can control how efficiently the ism with agb and sn ejecta can be removed from the lmc .",
    "we investigate non - wind ( i.e. , standard , burst , non - burst ) , selective wind , and non - selective wind models .",
    "we discuss our parameter study for the above variables in  2.5 .",
    "we adopt the nucleosynthesis yields of sne ii and ia from t95 to deduce @xmath53 and @xmath54 for a given imf .",
    "stars with masses larger than @xmath55 explode as sne ii soon after their formation and eject their metals into the ism .",
    "in contrast , there is a time delay ( @xmath31 ) between the star formation and the metal ejection for sne ia . we here adopt the following dtd ( @xmath33 ) ) for 0.1 gyr @xmath56 10 gyr , which is consistent with recent observational studies on the sn ia rate in extra - galaxies ( e.g. , totani et al . 2008 ; maoz et al .",
    "2010 , 2011 ) : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a normalization constant that is determined by the number of sn ia per unit mass ( which is controlled by the imf and the binary fraction for intermediate - mass stars for the adopted power - law slope of @xmath59 ) .",
    "maoz & badens ( 2010 ) detected a population of prompt snia in the lmc and showed that the number of prompt snia per stellar mass formed is @xmath60 .",
    "although we mainly investigate the `` prompt sn ia models '' with the above dtd , we also investigate the `` classical sn ia models '' with 1 gyr @xmath56 3 gyr ( e.g. , yoshii et al . 1996 ) .",
    "this snia lifetime in yoshii et al .",
    "( 1996 ) was deduced by using their galactic chemical evolution models that can be consistent with the observed [ o / fe][fe / h ] relations of the galactic stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "the fraction of the stars that eventually produce sne ia for 38@xmath61 has not been observationally determined and thus is regarded as a free parameter , @xmath62 .",

    ", we use the following formula ( renzini & buzzoni 1986 ) : @xmath85 where @xmath84 is in solar units and time @xmath86 is in years . by using the adopted imf and equations ( 9 ) and ( 10 )",
    ", we numerically estimate @xmath34 ( i.e. , how much agb ejecta can be returned into ism per unit mass ) in equation ( 2 ) at each time step .",
    "the adopted imf is defined as @xmath87 , where @xmath78 is the initial mass of each individual star and the slope @xmath88 corresponds to the salpeter imf ( salpeter 1955 ) .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath89 is a function of @xmath12 , @xmath90 ( lower mass cut - off ) , and @xmath91 ( upper mass cut - off ) .",
    "these @xmath90 and @xmath91 are set to be @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively ( so that the normalization factor @xmath89 is dependent simply on @xmath12 ) .",
    "we investigate models with different @xmath12 to find the model(s ) that can best explain the observed abundance patterns of stars in the lmc .",
    "we do not discuss models with different @xmath91 , because the effects of changing @xmath91 on the lmc chemical evolution are similar to those of changing @xmath12 .",
    "we mainly investigate the standard ( labeled as `` s '' ) , burst ( `` b '' ) , and double - burst ( `` db '' ) models in which stellar wind effects are not included at all ( i.e. , `` non - wind models '' ) . by using these non - wind models ,",
    "we demonstrate how the imf slope ( @xmath12 ) and the epochs of starburst ( @xmath94 and @xmath95 ) can influence the chemical evolution of the lmc .",

    "the time @xmath96 is the time that has elapsed since the model calculation started .",
    "therefore @xmath97 gyr ( 13 gyr ) represent the time when the calculation starts ( ends ) .",
    "previous observational and theoretical studies have suggested that there could be at least two epochs of enhanced star formation ( starburst ) about @xmath8 gyr ago and @xmath98 gyr ago ( e.g. , hz09 and db12 ) .",

    "table 1 summarizes the representative 26 models investigated in the present study .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the time evolution of star formation rates ( sfrs ) and [ fe / h ] of stars in the five representative models ( s1 , b1 , b6 , db1 , and db6 ) with different parameters controlling the lmc star formation history .",
    "no burst of star formation is assumed in s1 whereas only one burst is assumed in b1 and b6 .",
    "two bursts of star formation at different epochs are assumed in db1 and db6 .",
    "these models are chosen so that they can , in combination , show a wide range of star formation histories in figure 1 : they are just examples of possible star formation histories of the lmc .",
    "we investigate how the final chemical abundances depend on the lmc star formation history by using the results of models with different star formation histories .",
    "figure 2 shows the time evolution of [ mg / fe ] and the [ mg / fe][fe / h ] relation in the models with prompt and classical sne ia .",
    "it is clear from this figure that the models with prompt sn ia show no plateau in the [ mg / fe][fe / h ] relation owing to the earlier chemical enrichment by sne ia that can eject an fe - rich gas .",
    "figure 2 also shows that the time evolution of [ mg / fe ] depends on @xmath62 in such a way that [ mg / fe ] can steeply decrease with time in the model with larger @xmath62 .",
    "we discuss these in more detail for different models in the following sections .",
    "we mainly investigate ( i ) the present gas mass fraction @xmath101 , ( ii ) the stellar metallicity of the youngest stellar population , [ fe / h]@xmath102 , ( iii ) amr , ( iv ) [ mg / fe][fe / h ] relation ( as an example of [ @xmath12/fe][fe / h ] relations ) , ( v ) [ ba / fe][fe / h ] relation ( as an example of the time evolution of @xmath103process elements ) , and ( vi ) mdf .",
    "we compare these results with the corresponding observations for the lmc . in order to demonstrate clearly how different chemical properties of the lmc",
    "are compared with those of the galaxy , we also show the observational results for the galaxy .",
    "we estimate the total stellar mass ( @xmath104 ) of the lmc by using the observed @xmath105-band luminosity ( @xmath106 ) and the reasonable mass - to - light ratio of @xmath107 for the observed @xmath108 color ( bell & de jong 2001 ) . by using the observed total mass ( @xmath109 ) of the lmc ism ( bernard et al .",
    "2008 ) and @xmath104 , we can estimate @xmath110 .",
    "the observational error bar of @xmath110 is due largely to the uncertainty of the stellar mass - to - light ratio for the lmc .",
    "we adopt [ fe / h]@xmath111 as derived by luck et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for cepheid variables with ages of 1060 myr , because these youngest populations can have the present - day stellar metallicity of the lmc .",
    "each of the observed amrs shows a wide spread in each age bin ( represented by an error bar ) owing to the presence of stars with different [ fe / h ] at each age bin . although this could make it difficult for us to derive the best model , we try to give at least some constraints on some of the model parameters .",
    "we mainly investigate time evolution of [ mg / fe ] and [ ba / fe ] , because these abundances are more reliably derived from observations .",
    "the [ mg / fe][fe / h ] and [ ba / fe][fe / h ] relations are examples of [ @xmath12/fe][fe / h ] and [ @xmath16-process / fe ] relations , respectively , in this study .",
    "first we describe the five standard models with different imfs in order to demonstrate the importance of the imf slopes in the lmc chemical evolution . in these models , @xmath112 is chosen such that the final stellar metallicity ( [ fe / h]@xmath102 ) can be @xmath113 ( i.e. , the observed value ) .",
    "figure 3 shows the amrs for the five models as well as the observed [ fe / h ] of the lmc field stars at different age bins and and individual gcs .",
    "the amr in each model is simply a plot of [ fe / h ] at each time step ( i.e. , not average [ fe / h ] over a given age bin like observation ) .",
    "although the observational errors are not small for old gcs in the lmc , their data points are included to compare stars with the lowest [ fe / h ] in the models with the corresponding observations .",
    "the five models with no burst of star formation can reproduce reasonably well the overall trend of the observed amr , which implies that the amr alone can not be used for discriminating burst and non - burst models for the lmc .",
    "these models , however , appear to be less consistent with the observed [ fe / h ] around ages of 23 gyr ( i.e. , @xmath1141011 gyr ) owing to the presence of stars with significantly lower metallicities ( @xmath115 [ fe / h ] @xmath116 ) .",
    "the models with shallower imfs show higher [ fe / h ] at a given age , which reflects the fact that chemical evolution can proceed more rapidly owing to a larger amount of metals produced by a larger number of sne .",
    "it should be stressed that these standard models can not reproduce so well the amr around ages of 39 gyr ( i.e. , @xmath114410 gyr ) derived by hz09 in which the amr shows systematically lower [ fe / h ] for a given age in comparison with other observations by c05 and carrera et al .",
    "( 2008 , c08 ) .",
    "the reason for this apparent difference in the observed amrs between different observations could be related to different methods to determine ages and metallicities of stars in the observations .",
    "if the results by hz09 are closer to the true amr of the lmc , then the standard models with no burst can be regarded as less realistic models for the lmc evolution .",
    "although the large [ fe / h ] dispersion around an age of 2 gyr ( i.e. , @xmath117 gyr ) could be simply due to star formation from gas with different metallicities ( i.e. , inner higher and outer lower metallicities of the lmc ism ) , it could also be caused by a sudden and rapid infall of metal - poor gas from outside the lmc disk .",
    "if the observed dispersion is due to an external gas infall , then it would have profound implications for the lmc evolution .",
    "we will later discuss the implications in  4 .",
    "figure 4 shows that [ mg / fe ] slowly and monotonically decreases with time regardless of the adopted imfs .",
    "this time - dependence of [ mg / fe ] is simply a result of a later contribution of snia to the chemical evolution of the lmc .",
    "the more significant decrease of [ mg / fe ] with time can be seen in the models with steeper imfs owing to the greater contribution of snia to the chemical evolution in these models .",
    "the [ mg / fe][fe / h ] relations do not show a plateau at low [ fe / h ] .",
    "the lack of a plateau in the [ mg / fe][fe / h ] relations reflects the fact that sne ia can chemically pollute the lmc ism from a very early stage ( @xmath118 yr ) of its evolution .",
    "the lack of a plateau appears to be seen in the observed [ mg / fe][fe / h ] relation for [ fe / h]@xmath0 , though it is not so clear .",
    "the [ mg / fe][fe / h ] relations in the models with @xmath119 can reproduce reasonably well the overall trend of the observed [ mg / fe ] relation , though the observation shows a large [ mg / fe ] dispersion at a given [ fe / h ] .",
    "the model with a very steep imf ( @xmath120 ) shows systematically lower [ mg / fe ] and therefore can not reproduce so well the locations of stars in the [ mg / fe][fe / h ] relation .",
    "the models with shallower imfs show systematically larger [ mg / fe ] in the present standard models .",
    "owing to the observed large dispersion of [ mg / fe ] , it is currently difficult to determine which imfs ( @xmath121 or 2.55 or 2.75 ) can better explain the observed [ mg / fe][fe / h ] relation .",
    "the observed high [ mg / fe ] ( @xmath122 ) for higher [ fe / h ] ( @xmath123 ) can not be explained by any of the standard models in the present study .",
    "figure 5 shows that [ ba / fe ] starts to slowly increase with time about 2 gyr after the commencement of active star formation in the lmc disk . this slow [ ba / fe ] increase is due to the ejection of @xmath103process elements from low - mass ( @xmath66 ) agb stars .",
    "the observed systematically high [ ba / fe ] ( @xmath124 for most stars ) at [ fe / h ] @xmath0 seems to be better reproduced by the models with steeper imfs , though the very high [ ba / fe ] ( @xmath125 ) in some stars at such low metallicities can not be reproduced at all by any of the standard models in the present study .",
    "the reason for the higher [ ba / fe ] at [ fe / h]@xmath11 in steeper imfs is that the numerical ratio of sne ii with masses of @xmath126 to those with @xmath127 ( and thus the contribution of these sne to the chemical evolution ) can change in the steeper imf and consequently [ ba / fe ] can increase more significantly in the early history of the chemical evolution of the lmc .",
    "the maximum [ ba / fe ] in the model with the salpeter imf is at most [ ba / fe]@xmath128 , whereas most of the lmc stars at [ fe / h]@xmath6 show [ ba / fe]@xmath129 .",
    "these results strongly suggest that the lmc could have had a steeper imf ( at least steeper than the salpeter imf with @xmath121 ) in its star formation history ( if the lmc has not experienced starbursts ) .",
    "the observed very high [ ba / fe ] ( @xmath130 ) of some stars at [ fe / h]@xmath131 can not be explained at all by any of the standard models in the present study .      in the present study ,",
    "the @xmath112 for each model is chosen such that the final [ fe / h ] ( i.e. , [ fe / h]@xmath102 ) is consistent with the observed one ( @xmath113 ) . a smaller amount of metals can be ejected from sne in the models with steeper imfs owing to the smaller numbers of sne .",
    "therefore , ism in the models with steeper imfs needs to be more rapidly consumed by star formation and chemically enriched by sn ejecta to reach [ fe / h]@xmath133 .",
    "figure 6 shows that ( i ) the models with steeper imfs show smaller @xmath110 and ( ii ) the model with @xmath134 is the most consistent with the observed @xmath110 .",
    "these results suggest that the observed @xmath110 and [ fe / h]@xmath102 combine to support the steeper imf ( @xmath135 ) of the lmc .",
    "however this suggestion depends on the adopted assumption that no ism can be expelled from the lmc in the standard models .",
    "if a significant fraction of cold ism can be stripped from the lmc , even the models with shallower imfs ( e.g. , @xmath136 ) may be able to explain both @xmath110 and [ fe / h]@xmath102 .",
    "likewise , if a significant fraction of cold ism can be recently accreted onto the lmc , the models with rather steep imfs ( e.g. , @xmath137 ) may explain both @xmath110 and [ fe / h]@xmath102 too .",
    "the burst of star formation and the subsequent efficient production of metals can rapidly and significantly increase [ fe / h ] in the burst models .",
    "therefore , the chemical evolution in the quiescent phase of star formation in the burst models needs to proceed more slowly ( i.e. , smaller @xmath112 ) in comparison with the standard models so that the final [ fe / h ] can be as low as @xmath113 .",
    "figure 7 shows the amrs in the five burst models with different imfs and @xmath112 . the burst model b3 can not reproduce the observed amr owing to the systematically low [ fe / h ] in the quiescent phase of star formation",
    "the model b1 with the salpeter imf can better explain the amr of c05 and c08 whereas the models with steeper imfs ( b2 and b5 ) can explain better the amr by hz09 .",
    "the observed amr thus can not give strong constraints on the imf of the lmc .",
    "owing to the observed large [ fe / h ] dispersion at an age of @xmath8 gyr ( @xmath117 gyr ) , the amr alone can not allow us to make a robust conclusion as to whether the lmc experienced a burst of star formation at an age of 2 gyr ( i.e. , @xmath117 gyr ) .      as shown in figure 8 , the overall trends of the [ mg / fe ] evolution in the quiescent phase for the burst models",
    "are similar to those for the standard ones .",
    "the [ mg / fe][fe / h ] relations in the burst models show `` bumps '' ( a sharp increase followed by a decrease in the time evolution of [ mg / fe ] ) whose magnitudes depend on @xmath138 and @xmath12 .",
    "the observed locations of the lmc stars in the [ mg / fe]-[fe / h ] plane do not show clearly such a bump .",
    "however , if the two stars with [ mg / fe]@xmath139 at [ fe / h]@xmath140 and @xmath141 are removed from figure 8 , then the remaining stars appear to show a bump around @xmath142[fe / h]@xmath143 .",
    "furthermore , the apparent lack of stars with [ mg / fe]@xmath144 at [ fe / h]@xmath145 suggests that [ mg / fe ] has been decreasing since [ fe / h]@xmath146 .",
    "thus the higher [ mg / fe ] at [ fe / h]@xmath131 could be evidence of a starburst around @xmath117 gyr ( i.e. , 2 gyr ago ) .",
    "however , the observed [ mg / fe ] dispersion at [ fe / h]@xmath131 is so large that we can not make a robust conclusion as to whether a starburst occurred in the lmc about @xmath117 gyr ( i.e. , 2 gyr ago ) . also it should be noted that the smaller number of stars at [ fe / h]@xmath147 could be responsible for the apparent lack of stars with higher ( @xmath144 ) [ mg / fe ] .",
    "figure 9 shows that irrespective of the model parameters , [ ba / fe ] rapidly decreases soon after the starbursts owing to the ejection of fe - rich gas from prompt sne ia in the time evolution of [ ba / fe ] .",
    "the temporary [ ba / fe ] decrease is subsequently followed by its rapid and sharp increase due to chemical pollution by agb ejecta . owing to the rapid [ ba / fe ] increase , the burst models can show systematically higher final [ ba / fe ] in comparison with the standard models with no burst . therefore , the observed presence of stars with higher [ ba / fe ] ( @xmath148 ) at [ fe / h]@xmath149 could be more consistent with the burst models .",
    "the burst models with steeper imfs ( @xmath150 ) show [ ba / fe]@xmath151 at [ fe / h]@xmath152 , which suggests that the combination of a steeper imf and a secondary starburst could be closely associated with the origin of stars with [ ba / fe ] as large as 0.7 .",
    "however , very high [ ba / fe ] ( @xmath153 ) at [ fe / h]@xmath131 can not be explained by the present starburst models .",
    "these stars with very high [ ba / fe ] could have been formed directly from agb ejecta that did not mix well with the ism .",
    "figure 10 clearly shows that the burst model with the salpeter imf can not reproduce simultaneously the observed @xmath110 and [ fe / h]@xmath102 owing to efficient chemical enrichment . on the other hand , a larger amount of gas needs to be consumed for the ism to be chemically enriched to [ fe / h]@xmath154 in the models with steep imfs ( @xmath150 ) so that @xmath110 can become significantly smaller in the model .",
    "the models with @xmath155 yet different star formation histories in the quiescent phases can best reproduce both the observed @xmath110 and [ fe / h]@xmath102 .",
    "these results on the imf - dependences are essentially the same as those derived for the standard model .",
    "figure 11 shows the dependences of the amrs on imfs and star formation histories in the quiescent phase for the double - burst models .",
    "the derived imf dependence of amrs are very similar to those in the burst ones .",
    "the model db3 with steep imf ( @xmath156 ) and less rapid star formation in the quiescent phase is inconsistent with any observational results on the amr .",
    "the model db1 with the salpeter imf can better reproduce the observed amrs of c05 and c08 whereas the model db2 with moderately steep imf ( @xmath134 ) can be better fit to the amr by h09 .",
    "although the burst at @xmath157 gyr is as strong as that at @xmath117 gyr , the signature of the burst in the amr is less clear in the double - burst models .",
    "the observed amr shows a large [ fe / h ] dispersion in the youngest stellar population ( i.e. , [ fe / h ] ranging from @xmath131 to @xmath158 ) , and the presence of such relatively metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath131 ) stars at the present time is puzzling .",
    "the recent accretion of metal - poor gas and the resultant active star formation ( before the burst at @xmath157 gyr ) could result in the formation of such metal - poor stars and thus introduce a larger scatter in [ fe / h ] at the young populations .",
    "figure 12 shows that the time evolution of [ mg / fe ] in the double - burst models is characterized by two occurrences of sharp [ mg / fe ] increase / decrease after starbursts , which result in two bumps .",
    "the double - burst models show two bumps in the [ mg / fe]-[fe / h ] plane , though such bumps are not clearly seen in the observations .",
    "the final [ mg / fe ] is larger than 0 for all double - burst models owing to the last starburst at @xmath157 gyr , which is a feature that discriminates between the burst and double - burst models .",
    "the models ( db3 , 4 and 5 ) with steeper imfs show smaller final [ mg / fe ] and the final [ mg / fe ] in the model db1 with @xmath121 is more consistent with the observed one for the lmc field stars",
    ". the observed [ mg / fe ] of the field stars with @xmath159[fe / h]@xmath160 appears to increase from @xmath158 to @xmath98 , which may be regarded as the second bump due to the starburst at @xmath157 gyr .",
    "the second bump can be shown more clearly in the models db3 and db5 with steeper imfs ( @xmath150 ) .",
    "as noted in  3.2 , the observed large [ mg / fe ] dispersion at a given [ fe / h ] makes it difficult for us to confirm the presence ( or absence ) of the first and second starbursts in the observed [ mg / fe][fe / h ] relation .",
    "figure 13 shows that [ ba / fe ] rapidly decreases soon after the first starburst at @xmath117 gyr and then increases until the commencement of the second starburst at @xmath157 gyr for the double - burst models with different imfs ( in the time evolution of [ ba / fe ] ) .",
    "the increase of [ ba / fe ] after the second starburst can not be seen , because the 0.2 gyr difference between the present and the last starburst is not long enough for agb stars to have chemically polluted the lmc ism .",
    "owing to the first starburst , [ ba / fe ] can become significantly high ( up to @xmath151 ) in the double - burst models .",
    "however , the maximum value across all models is still significantly lower than those ( @xmath153 ) observed in some stars with [ fe / h]@xmath161 . the models with steeper imfs can show higher final [ ba / fe ] and they can better explain the clear differences in the locations of field stars in the [ ba / fe]-[fe / h ] plane between the lmc and the galaxy .",
    "figure 14 shows that the best model to explain both @xmath101 and [ fe / h]@xmath102 simultaneously is the one with @xmath134 among the double - burst models ( i.e. , db2 and db4 ) .",
    "this result combined with those in the standard and burst models strongly suggests that the imf of the lmc should be moderately steeper ( @xmath135 ) in its long - term star formation history .",
    "as demonstrated , the models with steeper imf can better explain the presence of the lmc field stars with [ ba / fe]@xmath3 and higher [ ba / fe ] of gcs at low metallicities ( [ fe / h]@xmath0 ) .",
    "it should be noted here that all ejecta from agb stars and sne are retained in the lmc for these non - wind models .",
    "thus , it can be concluded that a steeper imf ( @xmath162 ) can better explain the star formation and chemical evolution histories of the lmc , _ as long as the lmc has not lost a significant amount of its chemically enriched ism through stellar winds . _",
    "figure 15 shows that ( i ) the amrs are not so different between selective wind models ( w1@xmath163w4 ) with different @xmath12 , @xmath112 , and @xmath164 and ( ii ) chemical evolution proceeds significantly more slowly in the non - selective wind model ( w5 ) than in the selective ones until recently ( @xmath165 gyr ) so that the amr in the non - selective wind model shows systematically lower [ fe / h ] for a given age .",

    "both already existing ism and newly synthesized metals can be efficiently removed from the lmc in the non - selective wind models so that the chemical evolution of the lmc can proceed much more slowly . as a result of this",

    "there is no remarkable difference in the [ mg / fe ] evolution between the selective and non - selective wind models .",
    "figure 17 shows that the selective wind models can show higher [ ba / fe ] ( @xmath3 ) for [ fe / h]@xmath6 for a range of @xmath12 and @xmath164 .",
    "the model w2 with @xmath134 and @xmath170 shows [ ba / fe]@xmath171 without secondary starbursts , because fe - rich gas is ejected from the lmc disk whereas the agb ejecta containing @xmath16-process elements ( e.g. , ba ) can be retained and thus used for chemical evolution .",
    "these results imply that efficient removal of sne ejecta from the lmc disk is a way to significantly increase [ ba / fe ] without starburst(s ) .",
    "the models with steeper imfs show higher [ ba / fe ] , which is essentially the same as the results derived for the standard models .",
    "the final ( thus maximum ) [ ba / fe ] in the non - selective wind model at [ fe / h ] @xmath172 is lower than 0.4 , and therefore inconsistent with the observed value , which implies that the non - selective wind model is less promising than the selective wind one as a reasonable model for lmc chemical evolution .",
    "figure 18 shows that the selective wind model w1 with the salpeter imf appears to better fit the observed @xmath110 and [ fe / h]@xmath102 than the models with steeper imf ( @xmath173 ) for @xmath170 ( w2 ) .",
    "however , the model with steeper imf and @xmath174 ( w4 ) can also better explain the observed two quantities than that with the salpeter imf and @xmath174 ( w3 ) : it should be noted that the model w5 can also explain @xmath110 but does not show the observed high [ ba / fe ] at [ fe / h]@xmath131 .",
    "these results mean that if we carefully choose the two parameters ( @xmath12 and @xmath164 ) , the observation can be well reproduced . the non - selective wind model with the salpeter imf can also reproduce both @xmath110 and [ fe / h]@xmath102 reasonably well .",

    "the apparent bump in the observed [ mg / fe][fe / h ] relation at [ fe / h]@xmath131 can be better reproduced in models with starbursts .",

    "the significantly higher ( @xmath125 ) [ ba / fe ] observed in _",
    "some _ old , metal - poor gcs ( [ fe / h]@xmath0 ) can not be explained by any of these models , either .",
    "the selective wind models with the salpeter imf can better explain observations than the non - wind models with the salpeter imf , though the selective wind models need to assume an apparently large @xmath170 and can not accurately reproduce the [ ba / fe ] of the stars in the metal - poor gcs with [ fe / h]@xmath0 .",
    "this leads us to suggest that a steeper imf is required for explaining the different observed chemical properties of the lmc in a self - consistent manner .",
    "the removal of metals from sne can also significantly increase the [ ba / fe ] ( up to @xmath178 ) after a starburst if a large @xmath179 is chosen in the selective wind models .",
    "this implies that the selective removal of sne ejecta could be partly responsible for the observed rather high [ ba / fe ] ( @xmath178 ) in the lmc field stars .",
    "thus , there are two possible ways to explain the high [ ba / fe ] : one is star formation directly from ba - rich agb ejecta and the other is significantly efficient selective removal of sn ejecta .",
    "thus , as summarized in table 2 , the four different types of models can explain most of the observed chemical properties of the lmc reasonably well ( except the unusually high [ ba / fe ] ) , as long as the model parameters are carefully chosen . the observed amr and overall trends of the [ mg / fe][fe / h ] ( and equally the [ @xmath12/fe][fe / h ] ) and the [ ba / fe][fe / h ] relations can give less strong constraints on the imf and the star formation history of the lmc .",
    "table 3 describes how the four key chemical properties of the lmc constrain the imf and the presence or absence of past starbursts .",
    "the present study has shown that the standard , burst , and double - burst models with steeper imfs ( @xmath162 ) can explain well the observed @xmath132 and [ fe / h]@xmath180 in a self - consistent manner .",
    "furthermore such non - wind models can not only better explain the observed higher [ ba / fe ] at [ fe / h]@xmath181 in the lmc ( due to the steeper imfs which raise the @xmath182-process / fe ratio ) , but also can reproduce well the overall dependence of [ ba / fe ] on [ fe / h ] .",
    "although the selective wind models with the salpeter imfs ( @xmath121 ) can explain both @xmath132 and [ fe / h]@xmath102 in a self - consistent manner for a larger @xmath164 ( @xmath128 ) , they can not explain so well the observed [ ba / fe ] at [ fe / h]@xmath183 .",
    "therefore , the non - wind models with steeper imfs seems to be slightly better models for the adopted stellar yields .",
    "although it seems to be premature to observationally determine whether the imf of the lmc is clearly steeper than the salpeter one , a number of previous observations have suggested a steeper imf in the lmc .",
    "for example , mateo ( 1988 ) investigated the imfs of stars with masses ranging from @xmath184 to @xmath185 in the six clusters of the lmc and found that the slopes are typically @xmath186 .",
    "hill et al .",
    "( 1994 ) also found a steeper imf ( @xmath187 ) for young stars with masses larger than @xmath188 in the lmc and also suggested that the imf can be different below and above @xmath188 .",
    "holtzman et al . (",
    "1997 ) investigated the imf for stars on the main sequence which are fainter than the oldest turnoff and discussed the possibility of a steep imf with @xmath150 for the lmc dominated by young populations .",
    "as shown in figures 4 and 6 of this paper , rather steep imfs ( e.g. , @xmath189 ) can not be consistent with the observed chemical properties and amr of the lmc .",
    "the only difference in the non - wind models with steeper imfs and the selective wind ones with the salpeter ones is the [ fe / h]-dependence of [ ba / fe ] at lower [ fe / h ] ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "most of the observed field stars and gcs with [ fe / h]@xmath0 in the lmc show [ ba / fe]@xmath176 , which is more consistent with the non - wind models with steeper imfs .",
    "however the total number of data points in the observed [ ba / fe][fe / h ] diagram is sufficiently small that we can not make a robust conclusion as to whether the non - wind models or the selective wind ones are better in explaining the observed [ ba / fe ] trend with [ fe / h ] .",
    "thus it is undoubtedly worthwhile for future spectroscopic observations to investigate [ ba / fe ] and other @xmath16-process elements of the metal - poor stellar populations of the lmc with [ fe / h]@xmath0 to obtain better constraints on the imf and the ejection processes of sn ejecta in the lmc .",
    "the present study first investigated how a prompt sne ia influences the chemical evolution of the lmc and thereby predicted that [ @xmath12/fe ] decreases monotonically ( until a secondary starburst occurs ) with no remarkable plateau in the [ @xmath12/fe][fe / h ] relation for low [ fe / h ] .",
    "we should first investigate [ mg / fe][fe / h ] relations , firstly because this element is most reliably determined by the observations among @xmath12-elements , and secondly because its yield is most reliably predicted by nucleosynthesis calculations .",
    "the second best @xmath12-element for this investigation is ca .",
    "on the other hand , ti and si are not so good since ti is not well predicted by sn ii nucleosynthesis , and the observed determination of the si abundance involves a large uncertainty .",
    "the observed [ mg / fe][fe / h ] relation does not show the predicted trends so clearly partly because of the large dispersion in [ mg / fe ] at each [ fe / h ] .",
    "although the physical reasons for the large [ mg / fe ] dispersion are not so clear , one of the posssible explanations is described as follows .",
    "if different local regions have different star formation histories ( e.g. , due to different local gas densities and gas infall rates ) in the lmc , as observed in recent observations ( e.g. , hz09 and r12 ) , then they can have different [ mg / fe ] owing to different chemical enrichment histories .",
    "therefore , the observed large scatter can be due to different evolutions of [ mg / fe ] in different local regions of the lmc .",
    "the observed [ ca / fe][fe / h ] relation can be also used for discussing whether there is evidence for the prompt sne ia playing a significant role in the chemical evolution of the lmc .",
    "figure 19 shows the locations of the lmc stars on the [ ca / fe]-[fe / h ] plane as well as the predicted [ ca / fe][fe / h ] relations for three different models .",
    "these three models are chosen because they , in combination , show widely different [ ca / fe][fe / h ] relations of the lmc stars .",
    "it is clear that [ ca / fe ] decreases as [ fe / h ] increases without showing a clear plateau for [ fe / h]@xmath11 in the lmc stars , which is consistent with the predictions of the present models with prompt sne ia .",
    "in addition , the observed locations of the lmc stars on the [ ti / fe]-[fe / h ] plane clearly show a trend for a wide range of metallicity similar to [ ca / fe ] ( e.g. , c12 ) .",
    "however the [ si / fe][fe / h ] relation does not show such a clear trend owing to a larger [ si / fe ] dispersion for stars with [ fe / h]@xmath0 ( e.g. , figure 4 in c12 ) .",
    "these results on the [ ca / fe][fe / h ] and [ ti / fe][fe / h ] relations are supporting evidence that prompt sne ia have influenced the chemical enrichment history of the lmc .",
    "figure 19 also shows that there are significant differences in the distribution of field stars on the [ ca / fe]-[fe / h ] plane between the lmc and the galaxy .",
    "the lmc stars with [ fe / h]@xmath190 have systematically lower [ ca / fe ] in comparison with their galactic counterparts with similar metallicities . the significantly lower [ ca / fe ] in the lmc stars can not be easily explained by the models even with very steep imfs with @xmath191 , though the models with steeper imfs can show lower [ ca / fe ] . on the other hand , the observations do not show significant differences in the locations of field stars on the [ mg / fe]-[fe / h ] plane between the lmc and the galaxy .",
    "given that the models with rather steep imfs ( @xmath192 ) show significantly low [ mg / fe ] ( @xmath5 ) , the models with unusually steep imfs ( @xmath193 ) are unable to explain both the observed distributions of the lmc field stars on the [ ca / fe]-[fe / h ] and [ mg / fe]-[fe / h ] planes .",
    "so how can we explain these observations ?",
    "if ca can be expelled more effectively from the lmc ism during explosions of sne ii in comparison with other @xmath12-elements , then [ ca / fe ] becomes significantly lower than [ mg / fe ] as chemical evolution proceeds .",
    "we here suggest that nucleosynthesis of jet - induced sne ii can be responsible for the origin of the rather low [ ca / fe ] as follows .",
    "shigeyama et al .",
    "( 2010 ) have recently investigated hydrodynamical processes and nucleosynthesis in jet - induced sne and derived aspherical distributions of chemical yields of the sne .",
    "they have found that both the [ ca / fe ] and the [ mg / fe ] in the ejecta of a jet - induced sn ii can depend strongly on azimuthal angles @xmath194 ( where @xmath195 corresponds to the direction of the jet ) .",
    "they have also found that [ mg / ca ] can be lower in lower @xmath194 in their a3 model in which the total explosion energy of an aspherical supernova is @xmath196 erg and the chemical abundances of o , mg , fe , ca , cr , mn , and zn for each @xmath194 are investigated ( see their figure 1 for the @xmath194 dependences ) . if the jet - induced sne ii eject with lower @xmath194 ( where a larger amount of ca - rich gas exists ) can be more efficiently expelled from the lmc , then [ ca / fe ] in the lmc becomes more rapidly lower ( in comparison with [ mg / fe ] ) as the chemical enrichment proceeds .",
    "although it is not clear at this stage whether or not this more efficient removal of ca from the lmc is really possible , we here discuss how much more efficiently ca should be removed in order to explain the observed [ ca / fe][fe / h ] relation .",
    "we have investigated the selective wind model ( w6 ) in which ca is removed more efficiently by a factor of 1.75 from the lmc in comparison with other elements of sne ii ejecta .",
    "therefore , @xmath48 in the equation ( 5 ) is rewritten in the model w6 as follows : @xmath197 the parameter values of @xmath12 , @xmath198 , @xmath164 in model w6 are the same as those adopted in model w2 ( i.e. , @xmath134 , @xmath199 , and @xmath170 ) .",
    "figure 19 demonstrates that model w6 shows a steeper [ ca / fe ] decrease with [ fe / h ] and a rather low final [ ca / fe ] ( @xmath154 ) at [ fe / h]@xmath154 .",
    "furthermore , it is confirmed that the [ mg / fe][fe / h ] in the model is also consistent with observations . although the results of the model are broadly consistent with observations , it is not clear why some of the intermediate - age lmc gcs with [ fe / h]@xmath200 have higher [ ca / fe ] ( @xmath158 ) than the field stars with similar metallicities .",
    "the possible difference in [ ca / fe ] between the gcs and the field stars in the lmc could be related to the differences in the formation processes between field stars and gcs and thus is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we will discuss the origin of this intriguing difference in our forthcoming papers based on chemodynamical numerical simulations of the lmc .",
    "recent observational studies have investigated the amr for different local regions in the lmc and thereby discussed the spatially resolved star formation and chemical evolution histories of the lmc ( e.g. , hz09 and r12 ) .",
    "hz09 have found that there are peaks of star formation at roughly 2 gyr , 500 myr , 100 myr , and 12 myr ago in the lmc .",
    "r12 also have revealed the presence of peaks in the star formation rates at 2.0 gyr and 250 myr ago .",
    "recent numerical simulations on the formation of the magellanic stream have shown that the lmc and the smc could have experienced strong tidal interactions at about 2 gyr and 250 myr ago , and suggested that the two interactions could have significantly enhanced star formation in the lmc ( db12 ) .",
    "these recent observational and theoretical studies imply that the lmc might have experienced a burst of star formation at least twice , though the epoch and the strength of each burst have not been precisely determined yet . in the following discussion ,",
    "we focus on the possible starbursts at @xmath8 gyr and @xmath201 myr ago .",
    "as shown in previous theoretical models , past starburst events can be imprinted on the chemical abundances of the stellar and gaseous components of the lmc ( e.g. , russell & dopita 1992 ; t95 ) . in particular ,",
    "[ @xmath12/fe ] as a function of [ fe / h ] can significantly change during starburst events ( e.g. , t95 ) and thus can be used to give strong constraints on the epochs of the events .",
    "pt98 clearly showed that ( i ) the non - selective wind model with a secondary starburst about 2 gyr ago can better explain the observed amr and ( ii ) [ @xmath12/fe ] can significantly and rapidly increase during the starburst and then slowly decrease to the solar value ( e.g. , [ mg / fe]@xmath158 ) .",
    "the present study has predicted that the chemical signatures of the starburst about 2 gyr ago include ( i ) a rapid increase of [ @xmath12/fe ] followed by a rapid decrease , ( ii ) a rapid decrease of [ ba / fe ] followed by a rapid increase , and ( iii ) a time delay between the [ @xmath12/fe ] and [ ba / fe ] peaks .    however , as pointed out in previous sections , these three chemical signatures of the past starburst event around 2 gyr ago can not be clearly seen in the observational results .",
    "figure 20 shows [ mg / fe][fe / h ] and [ ba / fe][fe / h ] relations for the five burst models ( b4@xmath163b9 ) with different epochs and strengths of starburst .",
    "the results shown in this figure ( and figure 8) suggest that although the observed higher [ mg / fe ] ( @xmath125 ) at [ fe / h]@xmath131 can be consistent with the rapid increase of [ mg / fe ] due to the starburst event , the large scatter in [ mg / fe ] around [ fe / h]@xmath131 does not allow us to make a robust conclusion on the origin of the higher [ mg / fe ] . similarly , the observed larger [ ba / fe ] ( @xmath3 ) for [ fe / h]@xmath202 , which is consistent with the present starburst models , can not be regarded as strong evidence for the presence of a starburst about 2 gyr ago owing to the small number of stars with known [ ba / fe ] for [ fe / h ] @xmath202 .",
    "more observational data sets are necessary to investigate how the secondary starburst about 2 gyr ago might have changed the chemical evolution history of the lmc .",
    "the amrs derived by different observational studies are significantly different so that the comparison between the observed amrs and the simulated ones in the present study can not provide strong constraints on the nature of the past starburst events either .",
    "concerning a possible starburst about 0.2 gyr ago , a chemical signature of the starburst about 0.2 gyr ago is the sudden increase of [ mg / fe ] around [ fe / h]@xmath203 , as shown in the present double - burst models .",
    "there is a hint of such a [ mg / fe ] increase in the observational data for the lmc field stars by p08 , though the number of the stars is very small ( only three ) .",
    "if the starburst is strong enough , then it can be imprinted on the mdf of the lmc .",
    "figure 21 describes the mdfs for [ fe / h ] and [ mg / fe ] in the five double - burst models .",
    "the mdfs here are relative frequency histograms that are binned with 0.1 dex bin width and normalized to the most populated bin .",
    "clearly the mdf of [ fe / h ] show the double peaks for the five models and such double peaks are not observed in the previous observation by c08",
    ". the observed apparent lack of a bimodal mdf in c08 could be due to the small number of young and metal - rich samples in c08 .",
    "if the observational result is real , then it means that the starburst about 0.2 gyr ago is much weaker than modeled in the present study ( so that it can not be detected in the observed mdf ) .",
    "the amr derived for the lmc by hz09 ( in their figure 20 ) appears to show a sudden and significant decrease of [ fe / h ] around 1.5 gyr ago followed by a rapid increase of [ fe / h ] , though hz09 did not discuss the origin of the possible `` dip '' in the amr .",
    "the amrs for some local regions of the lmc derived by r12 also appear to show the dips whereas the amr by c08 does not clearly show the dip .",
    "if the observed dip around 1.5 gyr ago ( hz09 ) is real , it has profound implications on the gas accretion history of the lmc .",
    "one of likely explanations for the possible dip is that a large amount of external metal - poor gas ( [ fe / h ] @xmath204 , significantly smaller than the gaseous metallicity of the lmc about 2 gyr ago ) was accreted onto the lmc from outside the lmc disk and consequently [ fe / h ] rapidly and significantly decreased .",
    "the observed apparently rapid decrease of [ fe / h ] by almost 0.2 dex at [ fe / h]@xmath205 ( hz09 ) can give some constraints on the amount of gas accreted onto the lmc for a given metallicity of the metal - poor gas .    in order to discuss how the amr of the lmc can change owing to the infall of metal - poor gas from outside the lmc disk",
    ", we have investigated the amrs of models with gas infall yet without any starburst before infall .",
    "the purpose of this investigation is to show clearly how the dip of the amr can be formed during the infall of metal - poor gas ( thus not to reproduce the observed amr fully self - consistently ) .",
    "therefore , we think that the adopted somewhat idealized models would be enough to show clearly the formation of the dip in the amr due to the infall of metal - poor gas . we have mainly investigated how much gas needs to be accreted onto the lmc by using the results of the `` infall models '' in which metal - poor gas with [ fe / h]=@xmath206 can be accreted onto the lmc at 1.5 gyr ago . here",
    "the metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath207 is chosen just for a representative case to clearly show the formation of the dip in the amr ( we also investigated the infall models with [ fe / h]@xmath208 for comparison ) .    in the infall models , the following infall rate of external gas ( @xmath209 ) is added to the right side of the equation ( 1 ) : @xmath210 where @xmath211 is the total mass of the external gas that can infall onto the lmc for @xmath212 , where @xmath213 and @xmath214 are the epochs when the gas infall starts and ends , respectively .",
    "therefore , the gas infall rate is assumed to be steady and constant in the present infall models .",
    "we investigate the models with @xmath215 gyr and @xmath216 gyr .",
    "the chemical abundance patterns of the gas is assumed to be the same as that of the lmc halo .",
    "therefore , the term of @xmath217 ( where @xmath218 is the chemical abundance of each element in the infalling gas ) is added to the right hand side of equation ( 2 ) to calculate the evolution of @xmath219 . owing to the infall of metal - poor gas , the mean metallicity of the youngest population becomes significantly lower .",
    "therefore , a starburst needs to occur after the gas infall so that the final [ fe / h ] can be @xmath113 , as observed .",
    "we thus assume that starbursts can occur before and after accretion of the metal - poor gas onto the lmc disk in the infall models , because the models with this assumption can be consistent also with the observational results by hz09 ( i.e. , a possible starburst about 2 gyr ago ) .",
    "we have particularly investigated the four infall models ( i1@xmath163i4 ) with @xmath134 and @xmath220 , @xmath221 , @xmath222 gyr , @xmath223 gyr , @xmath224 , @xmath225 gyr , [ fe / h]@xmath207 in external infalling gas , and different @xmath226 and @xmath211 .",
    "these models were chosen because they can together show different degrees of sudden [ fe / h ] drop ( or different depths of the dip ) in the amrs . for comparison , we have investigated a model ( i5 ) with [ fe / h]@xmath208 in external gas for comparison .",
    "the model parameters for these models are shown in table 4 .",
    "figure 22 shows the amrs for the last @xmath227 gyr ( i.e. , @xmath228 gyr ) in the four infall models in which @xmath211 ranges from 0.1 to 0.4 in simulation units . @xmath229",
    "thus means that the total amount of external gas accretion is the same as the total amount of gas accreted onto the lmc from its own halo for the last 13 gyr .",
    "the value of @xmath226 in each model is chosen such that the final [ fe / h ] can be consistent with the observed one .",
    "for comparison , the amr of the burst model b2 without gas infall is shown in this figure .",
    "clearly stellar [ fe / h ] can rapidly decrease soon after the metal - poor gas is accreted onto the lmc with the magnitude of the decrease depending on the amount of the accreted gas ( @xmath211 ) .",
    "the model i3 with @xmath230 can show the dip of @xmath231 dex , which means that @xmath10 needs to be accreted onto the lmc for explaining the observed dip .",
    "other models with lower @xmath211 ( i.e. , i1 and i2 ) show less remarkable dips in the amrs and thus are less consistent with the observations . if the metallicity of the accreted gas is higher than the adopted one ( [ fe / h]=@xmath206 ) , then even a larger amount of gas needs to be accreted onto the lmc to form the remarkable dip in the amr . for example , if the infalling gas has [ fe / h]@xmath232 , then @xmath233 is required for explaining the dip of @xmath231 dex observed in the amr .",
    "we thus conclude that if the observed dip is real , then a massive accretion event of metal - poor gas with @xmath211 of at least @xmath10 is required to explain the observed magnitude of the dip .",
    "previous numerical simulations by bc07 and db12 demonstrated that the gas of the smc can be accreted onto the lmc after tidal stripping of the smc gas caused by the strong lmc ",
    "smc  galaxy interaction .",
    "these simulations showed that there could be two accretion events around 1.5 gyr and 0.2 gyr ago , which means that the first accretion event about 1.5 gyr ago is a promising candidate which can provide a large enough amount of gas to form the dip in the lmc amr .",
    "however , the total amount of the smc gas transferred to the lmc about 1.5 gyr ago in these simulations is less than @xmath234 for the total smc mass of @xmath235 .",
    "the predicted gas mass is much smaller than the required mass ( @xmath236 ) for explaining the observed dip .",
    "this means that the smc gas accreted onto the lmc is unlikely to explain the observed dip of 0.2 dex , if the total mass of the smc about 2 gyr ago is similar to that of the present smc ( @xmath237 ) .",
    "however , if the smc was originally much more massive , the required amount of gas mass could be transferred from the smc to the lmc .",
    "then where does such a large amount of metal - poor gas come from ?",
    "one possible scenario is that a gas - rich dwarf galaxy with a total gas mass of @xmath238 merged with the lmc about 1.5 gyr ago and the mixing of the gas with the lmc ism caused a significant decrease of [ fe / h ] .",
    "since the gas - mass of the dwarf should be similar to that of the lmc in order to explain the observed dip , the dwarf would have to have had a total mass similar to the lmc .",
    "this means that the lmc stellar disk could have been severely damaged by the violent dynamical process of such a major merger event .",
    "the thick disk and counter - rotating stellar components ( e.g. , subramaniam & prabhu 2005 ) might have been formed from this major merger event occurring in the lmc about 1.5 gyr ago . a merged dwarf",
    "as massive as the lmc should have a much lower star formation rate than the lmc so that it can have a low metallicity .",
    "this discussion depends on the assumption that the observed dip of 0.2 dex is real and the dip was caused by a massive gas accretion event .",
    "given that the amplitude of the dip provides information about the total mass of a gas - rich dwarf merging with the lmc ( or the total mass of gas accretion onto the lmc ) , it would be quite important for future extensive observational studies to confirm the presence or the absence of the dip(s ) in the amr .",
    "although the present models can reproduce reasonably well the overall trend of [ ba / fe ] with [ fe / h ] and the higher [ ba / fe ] ( @xmath139 ) for [ fe / h]@xmath143 in the lmc , they can not explain the stars with [ ba / fe]@xmath153 .",
    "we have confirmed that even the selective wind models with steep imfs and efficient metal ejection ( @xmath239 ) can show at most [ ba / fe]@xmath178 .",
    "this failure of the present one - zone chemical evolution models is related to the adopted assumption that agb ejecta can be mixed with ism soon after agb stars eject their @xmath16-process elements .",
    "if the agb ejecta does not mix well with the surrounding ism and consequently can be converted into new stars , then the stars can show rather high [ ba / fe ] : figure 1 in tb12 shows the observed rather high ( @xmath240 ) [ ba / fe ] in the envelope of agb stars with different metallicities .",
    "we thus propose that the stars with unusually high [ ba / fe ] ( @xmath153 ) in the lmc were formed as a result of incomplete mixing of ism and agb ejecta .",
    "a key question here is how energetic stellar winds from agb stars can cool down to become cold gas for star formation without mixing so well with the surrounding ism .",
    "recent hydrodynamical simulations have shown that secondary star formation directly from agb ejecta is possible in massive star clusters owing to the deeper gravitational potentials ( e.g. , bekki 2011 ) .",
    "although this secondary star formation appears to be a convincing mechanism for the formation of stars with unusually high [ ba / fe ] in the lmc gcs , it can not explain why some of the lmc _ field stars _ show such high [ ba / fe ] .",
    "one possibility for the field star formation from agb ejecta is that agb ejecta can assemble in the hi holes ( e.g. , kim et al .",
    "1999 ) , where ism can be almost completely blown away by sne , and then can be converted into cold gas there without mixing efficiently with chemically enriched ism .",
    "the new stars formed from agb ejecta in the hi holes can naturally have very high [ ba / fe ] .",
    "thus it would be important for observational studies to confirm whether the locations of young stars with very high [ ba / fe ] are more likely to be in the present hi holes .",
    "our future chemodynamical simulations will investigate whether this star formation from agb ejecta in hi holes is really possible in the lmc .",
    "we have investigated the chemical evolution of the lmc by using new one - zone chemical evolution models in which both chemical pollution by prompt sne ia and metallicity dependent chemical yields of agb stars are incorporated and the imf is a free parameter .",
    "we have particularly investigated three different types of models with or without starburst ( i.e. , standard , burst , and double - burst models ) so that we can discuss the importance of previous starbursts in the history of the chemical evolution of the lmc .",
    "we furthermore have investigated the wind models in which gaseous ejecta from agb stars , sne ia , and sne ii can be removed partly from the lmc owing to stellar feedback effects of sne and agb stars .",
    "the principle results of the models are summarized as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) the observed gas mass fraction ( @xmath241 ) and the metallicity of youngest stellar populations ( [ fe / h]@xmath242 ) in the lmc together give some constraints on the imf and the efficiency of gas removal by stellar feedback effects .",
    "both @xmath132 and [ fe / h]@xmath102 can be best reproduced by a steeper imf with @xmath134 for the standard ( i.e. , no burst ) models in a self - consistent manner , if the gaseous ejecta from agb stars and sne are not removed from the lmc ( i.e. , non - wind models ) .",
    "this tendency of steeper imfs to better explain @xmath132 and [ fe / h]@xmath102 simultaneously can be seen also in the burst and double - burst models .",
    "furthermore , the observed higher [ ba / fe ] ( @xmath176 ) of stars in gcs at [ fe / h]@xmath0 in the lmc is also more consistent with steeper imfs ( @xmath243 ) .",
    "\\(2 ) however , the models with the salpeter imf ( @xmath121 ) can also explain the observed @xmath110 and [ fe / h]@xmath102 , if significant fractions ( @xmath244 ) of gaseous ejecta from sne are _ selectively _ removed from the lmc ( i.e. , no removal of agb ejecta ) .",
    "these selective wind models are significantly more reasonable than the uniform wind ones proposed by pt98 in which ism , agb ejecta , and supernova ones are equally removed .",
    "this is because an unreasonably large amount of gas ( @xmath245 , or three times the present stellar mass of the lmc ) need to be removed from the lmc for the best uniform wind models with the salpeter imf",
    ". the wind models with the salpeter imf , however , can not reproduce well the observed higher [ ba / fe ] ( @xmath176 ) at lower [ fe / h ] ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "thus , although removal of sne ejecta could be important in the chemical evolution of the lmc , an imf steeper than the salpeter one is required for explaining @xmath110 , [ fe / h]@xmath102 , and [ ba / fe ] at low [ fe / h ] in a self - consistent manner .",
    "\\(3 ) the present models predict that [ @xmath12/fe ] starts to decrease monotonically only @xmath246  yr after the commencement of active star formation in the lmc owing to rapid chemical enrichment by ejecta from prompt sne ia .",
    "the observed [ ca / fe][fe / h ] relation with the apparent lack of the plateau can be consistent with models with chemical pollution by prompt sne ia rather than by classical ones .",
    "this suggests that the observed [ ca / fe][fe / h ] relation is supporting evidence for prompt sne ia playing a key role in the chemical evolution of the lmc .",
    "however , it should be noted that [ mg / fe ] does not so show such a clear trend as decreasing [ mg / fe ] with increasing [ fe / h ] ( like [ ca / fe][fe / h ] relation ) for the entire sample of stars and gcs .",
    "\\(4 ) the present models predict that if the lmc experienced a starburst about 2 gyr ago , [ @xmath12/fe ] can start to rapidly increase ( up to 0.3 ) at [ fe / h]@xmath200 owing to gaseous ejecta of sne ii and then soon decrease owing to the fe - rich ejecta from prompt sne ia .",
    "therefore , the best model predicts a `` bump '' in the [ @xmath12/fe][fe / h ] relation around [ fe / h]@xmath200 , though such a bump can not be so clearly seen in the observed [ @xmath12/fe][fe / h ] relation owing to the apparently large scatter of [ @xmath12/fe ] at [ fe / h]@xmath200 .",
    "the observed presence of stars with [ mg / fe]@xmath144 at @xmath247[fe / h]@xmath248 and the observed apparent lack of stars with [ mg / fe]@xmath249 at @xmath159[fe / h]@xmath160 can be consistent with the presence of the bump , though the smaller number of observational data points for [ fe / h]@xmath147 could be responsible for the apparent dip .",
    "\\(5 ) if the lmc experiences a secondary starburst , [ ba / fe ] temporarily decreases owing to fe - rich ejecta from sne ii and prompt sne ia then increases sharply owing to agb ejecta that is rich in @xmath16-process elements .",
    "for example , if the lmc experienced a starburst about 2 gyr ago when the lmc had [ fe / h]@xmath250 , then the lmc shows the [ ba / fe ] peak at [ fe / h]@xmath154 in the [ ba / fe][fe / h ] relation .",
    "furthermore , [ ba / fe ] can show its peak ( up to @xmath151 ) always after [ @xmath12/fe ] takes its peak value . as a natural result of this ,",
    "[ fe / h ] at the [ ba / fe ] peak is higher than that at the [ @xmath12/fe ] peak in the [ ba / fe][fe / h ] and [ @xmath12/fe][fe / h ] relations .",
    "these predicted trends of [ ba / fe ] are not so clearly seen in the observed [ ba / fe][fe / h ] relation owing to the large scatter of [ ba / fe ] . however , the observed larger [ ba / fe ] at [ fe / h ] @xmath154 is more consistent with the present burst models ( in particular with those of steeper imfs ) .",
    "however , the observed very large [ ba / fe ] @xmath251 at [ fe / h]@xmath200 in some field stars and gcs of the lmc can not be simply explained by any model in the present study .",
    "thus we have proposed that such very high [ ba / fe ] stars could be formed from agb ejecta that did not mix well with ism .",
    "\\(6 ) the observed amr has a large scatter , so the standard ( non - burst ) , burst , and double - burst models can be all consistent with the amr , which implies that the amr does not give strong constraints on the lmc star formation history .",
    "the present double - burst models have bimodal distributions of [ fe / h ] ( i.e. , two peaks in the mdf ) , which have not been observed yet . therefore ,",
    "the double - burst models are the least consistent with observations among the three different types of models investigated in the present study in terms of the mdf .",
    "accordingly , we suggest that the observationally inferred recent starburst around 0.10.5 gyr ago by hz09 should be weak so as to reproduce the observed mdf .",
    "\\(7 ) if the observed apparent dip ( i.e. , a sudden [ fe / h ] decrease by @xmath231 dex ) in the amr around 1.5 gyr ago is real , then it has a profound implication for the gas accretion history of the lmc .",
    "the present models predict that the dip could be due to the accretion of a large amount ( @xmath10 ) of metal - poor gas ( [ fe / h]@xmath11 ) from other gas - rich galaxies about 1.5 gyr ago .",
    "given that previous numerical simulations ( e.g. , bc07 and db12 ) demonstrated a gas transfer from the smc to the lmc caused by tidal stripping of the smc about 1.5 gyr ago , the smc gas could be responsible for the gas accretion event in the lmc .",
    "however , the required large amount of gas ( @xmath10 ) is much larger than the predicted amount ( @xmath252 ) in previous simulations .",
    "there can be two possible scenarios for the gas transfer .",
    "one is that the smc was originally much more massive than the present smc , as suggested by the recent modeling of the smc s rotation curve ( bekki & stanivirovic 2009 ) , so that a large amount of gas can be transferred from the smc to the lmc .",
    "the other is that the lmc experienced a major merger with a massive gas - rich dwarf galaxy .",
    "such a gas - rich major merger event may be responsible for the formation of the thicker and extended stellar disk observed in the lmc .",
    "\\(8 ) the observed rather low [ ca / fe ] ( @xmath5 ) at [ fe / h]@xmath6 in the lmc field stars can not be simply explained by the present models , in which all elements of sne are equally efficiently removed from the lmc .",
    "we have thus proposed that if ca can be ( by a factor of @xmath8 ) more efficiently removed from the lmc through supernova feedback effects in comparison with other elements , then the observed unusually low [ ca / fe ] and normal [ mg / fe ] for [ fe / h]@xmath6 can be simultaneously explained .",
    "although it remain unclear why such more efficient removal of ca should occur in the chemical enrichment history of the lmc , we have proposed that a characteristic nucleosynthesis of jet - induced sne can be associated with the origin of the field stars with unusually low [ ca / fe ] .",
    "the origin of the higher [ ca / fe ] in the intermediate - age gcs of the lmc remains unclear .",
    "\\(9 ) the differences in imfs and removal efficiencies of agb and sn ejecta between the lmc and the galaxy might be responsible for the observed clear differences in the locations of the stars in the [ @xmath12/fe][fe / h ] and [ ba / fe][fe / h ] relations between the two galaxies .",
    "our future chemodynamical simulations of the star formation and chemical enrichment histories in the lmc will investigate how and why the imf and the removal processes of stellar ejecta of the two galaxies might be different .",
