    "twisted accretion discs around rotating black holes are used for explanations of different observational phenomena .",
    "for example they are invoked to explain jet precession observed in certain active galactic nuclei ( agn ) ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) , warping of the accretion disc in the maser galaxy ngc 4258 ( e.g. @xcite ) , certain features of emission line profiles coming from agn ( e.g. @xcite ) etc .. @xcite proposed that shear velocities induced by the disc twist ( see below ) provide a mechanism of excitation of high frequency quasi - periodic oscillations observed in many astronomical objects . light curves , forms of emission lines of precessing twisted tori around a kerr black hole as well as their shapes as seen from large distances have recently been investigated numerically by @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies of thin twisted discs started from the seminal paper @xcite , who proposed a simple model of a stationary twisted disc , where a twisted disc was considered as a collection of circular rings interacting with each other due to viscous forces . in frameworks of this model bardeen and petterson came to the conclusion that a stationary twisted disc inclined with respect to the black hole equatorial plane at large distances from the black hole aligns with this plane at smaller radii - the effect called later as `` the bardeen - petterson effect '' .",
    "this alignment was explained as being due to the presence of gravitomagnetic force acting from the side of a rotating black hole on the disc rings .",
    "this force causes precession of orbital planes of free particles around a direction of the black hole spin and breaks the spherical symmetry of the problem .",
    "the bardeen and petterson approach was later developed and generalised on non - stationary twisted discs by e.g. @xcite .    in frameworks of hydrodynamical theory of perturbations",
    "@xcite pointed out that the simple model developed in the previous works is , in fact , inconsistent since it does not conserve all components of the angular momentum content of an accretion disc .",
    "they showed that a self - consistent model must , necessarily , contain perturbations of the disc density and velocity fields induced by the disc twist , which determine deviations of the gas particles motion in the disc from the circular one ( see @xcite for a qualitative explanation of this effect ) . in particular , the velocity perturbations should be odd with respect to the disc vertical coordinate thus having the structure of a shear flow .",
    "@xcite also found that when a sufficiently viscous disc is considered in the classical newtonian gravitational field of a point mass a typical alignment scale of a stationary twisted configuration decreases with decrease of the @xcite @xmath0 parameter ( see also e.g. @xcite ) and that non - stationary propagation of twisted disturbances through the disc has a diffusive character with a characteristic time scale being also proportional to @xmath0 ( also e.g. @xcite ) contrary to what was claimed in the previous studies .",
    "these two effects are determined by the well known degeneracy of the keplerian potential , which has orbital and epicyclic frequencies equal to each other .",
    "it was later shown by @xcite that in the opposite case of a low viscosity keplerian disc propagation of non - stationary twisted disturbances through the disc has a wave - like character with a typical speed of the order of speed of sound in the disc .",
    "these studies considered the gravitational field of a black hole as a field of a newtonian point mass with the gravitomagnetic force being treated as a classical force causing precession of the disc rings .",
    "@xcite considered post - newtonian corrections to equations describing velocity perturbations .",
    "they found that when a low viscosity stationary twisted disc is considered and the disc gas is rotating in the same sense as a black hole the bardeen - petterson effect does not take place .",
    "instead , there are radial oscillations of the disc inclination angle with amplitude increasing with decrease of the distance from the black hole .",
    "this effect was later confirmed by time dependent calculations made by @xcite .",
    "@xcite also provided a qualitative explanation of this effect and a general criterion of appearance of these oscillations .",
    "namely , they take place in a low viscosity stationary twisted disc when the signs of the apsidal and nodal precessions are the same . in the opposite case",
    "the disc aligns with the equatorial plane of the black hole for any value of viscosity .",
    "for example , the latter situation is realised when the black hole rotates in the direction opposite to the direction of the orbital motion of the gas in the disc , see @xcite and below or when a newtonian twisted disc around a massive binary star or a binary black hole is considered , e.g. @xcite .",
    "we are going to show below that this criterion is applicable to our fully relativistic problem as well and that whether the disc aligns with the equatorial plane or not depends on the direction of rotation of the black hole relative to the orbital motion .",
    "additionally , @xcite showed that the linear analysis made by @xcite and @xcite can be extended to the case of disc inclination angles , which are larger than the disc opening angle @xmath12 , where @xmath5 is the disc half thickness and @xmath1 is the radial coordinate , and the precise definition of the angle @xmath3 is made in such way that it is a constant independent on @xmath1 , see equations ( [ eq31 ] ) and ( [ eq32 ] ) below .",
    "this was done by employing a formalism based on the so - called `` twisted coordinate '' system introduced by @xcite .",
    "an analogous coordinate system has later been used by @xcite to consider the disc inclination angles of order of unity and , accordingly , to construct a non - linear theory of evolution of sufficiently viscous twisted discs .",
    "as we described above , all previous formalisms of description of the thin twisted discs were based either on the classical or post - newtonian treatments of the problem .",
    "it is , however , important to consider the problem in full general relativity .",
    "this is especially crucial either for the discs having a small value of @xmath13 or in the case of slowly rotating black holes having their rotational parameter @xmath14 , where a stationary accretion disc can be twisted at scales comparable to the black hole gravitational radius , @xmath15 .",
    "a formalism based on general relativity can also be very useful for a quantitative modelling of emission spectra coming from twisted disc as well as for accurate studying of many other physical processes occurring in such discs like e.g. their self - irradiation .    in this paper",
    "we construct a fully relativistic theory of thin twisted discs at radii larger than the radius of the last stable orbit around slowly rotating black holes , treating the effect of the black hole rotation in the linear approximation only .",
    "this essentially means that only one term in general equations of motion ( proportional to the rotational parameter @xmath6 and describing the gravitomagnetic force ) can be taken into account and all quantities entering in our final equations describing dynamics of twisted discs can be defined with help of the schwarzschild metric of a non - rotating black hole .",
    "we make the usual assumptions of smallness of the disc opening angle @xmath3 , the disc inclination angle @xmath16 with respect to the equatorial plane and its logarithmic derivative , @xmath17 .",
    "additionally , we neglect self - gravity of the discs . we generalise the twisted coordinate system of @xcite to the relativistic case and",
    "write down our general equations of motion in this generalised coordinate system .",
    "we show that these equations can be naturally split on two different subsets : 1 ) a set of equations describing the standard flat disc accretion and 2 ) a set of equations determining dynamics of variables related to the disc twist . as a set of the standard equations we use equations of the well known @xcite accretion disc model , which is the relativistic generalisation of the @xcite @xmath0-disc model .",
    "equations of the set 2 ) are used to derive a pair of equations ( [ eq50 ] ) and ( [ eq51 ] ) fully describing the dynamics and stationary configurations of twisted discs under our approximations .",
    "similar to the case of newtonian twisted discs ( see e.g. @xcite ) these equations can be formulated for two dependent complex variables - @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the second euler angle determining longitude of ascending nodes of the disc rings , and @xmath20 determining the form of velocity perturbations in the disc .    in the second part of the paper we study in detail shapes of stationary configurations , which are described by equation ( [ eq52 ] ) .",
    "we show that this equation contains only two independent parameters - @xmath0 assumed to be a constant throughout the disc and @xmath21 .",
    "when the disc gas rotates in the same direction as the black hole ( @xmath22 ) , for the gas pressure dominated @xcite models we find that there are three possible qualitatively different shapes of the twisted discs depending on values of @xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath0 is very small the disc exhibits oscillations of the inclination angle , which have a different character of amplitude and radial frequency behaviour at large distances from the black hole and close to the last stable orbit .",
    "the disc behaviour at large radii is the same as described by @xcite . on the other hand oscillations of the inclination angle close to the last stable orbit",
    "proceed in a different regime , with the amplitude and the radial frequency strongly growing towards the last stable orbit .",
    "when @xmath0 has moderately small values the oscillations are suppressed but the disc does not align with the black hole equatorial plane .",
    "the inclination angle is either monotonically growing towards the last stable orbit or exhibits a non - monotonic behaviour decreasing with decrease of @xmath1 at large radii and increasing again towards the last stable orbit at smaller radii . finally , when @xmath0 is sufficiently large the bardeen - petterson effect takes place .    in section 2",
    "we present our basic definitions , introduce the twisted coordinate system , describe fundamental equations of motions and the flat disc model used in our study . in section 3",
    "we derive our final equations ( [ eq50 ] ) and ( [ eq51 ] ) describing the dynamics and stationary configuration of the twisted discs .",
    "section 4 is devoted to analytical and numerical studies of the stationary twisted configurations .",
    "note that section 3 and section 4 can be read independently .",
    "we use the natural systems of units throughout the paper setting the gravity constant and the speed of light to unity .",
    "the metric signature is @xmath23 and the usual summation rule over repeating indices is implied .",
    "as was mentioned in introduction we assume that the black hole rotates slowly with the rotational parameter @xmath14 and derive our dynamical equations taking into account only leading terms in @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , for our purposes , it suffices to consider the metric of a kerr black hole in the boyer - lindquist coordinates taking into account only linear in @xmath6 terms @xmath24 it is easy to see that apart from the @xmath25 term the metric coincides with the metric of a non - rotating black hole written in the schwarzschild coordinates , see e.g. @xcite .    in the non - relativistic problems the dynamical equations for the twisted discs take simplest form in the so - called `` twisted coordinates '' introduced by @xcite . as we discuss in section 2.2 these coordinates",
    "are obtained from the cylindrical ones by rotation . in order to find a simple relativistic generalisation of the twisted coordinates we would like to bring the metric ( [ eq1 ] ) into another , the so - called spatially isotropic form , where the spatial part of the line element is proportional to the cartesian line element .",
    "this is done by the change of the radial coordinate @xmath26 which brings ( [ eq1 ] ) in the form @xmath27 where the radial and time coordinates are expressed in units of @xmath28 from now on . introducing the cylindrical coordinates @xmath29 we can rewrite ( [ eq3 ] ) in an equivalent form @xmath30 where @xmath31    the metric ( [ eq3 ] ) induces an associated orthonormal tetrad of one - forms @xmath32    we also use cartesian coordinates @xmath33 related to @xmath34 in the usual way .",
    "the twisted coordinates @xmath35 are obtained from the cartesian ones by rotation @xmath36 where the euler angles @xmath37 and @xmath38 are functions to be determined .",
    "the inclination angle @xmath16 is assumed to be small .",
    "it is evident that @xmath39 .",
    "since only @xmath40 is used below we omit the index @xmath41 later on .",
    "it is also convenient to use @xmath42 in our expressions and introduce the variables @xmath43 instead of @xmath16 and @xmath19 and the quantities @xmath44 where partial derivatives over @xmath45 and @xmath1 are denoted by dot and prime , respectively .",
    "the orthonormal one - forms associated with the twisted coordinate system are given by the expressions @xmath46",
    "@xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 see appendix a for their relation to the coordinate forms ( [ eq6 ] ) .",
    "when @xmath50 the twisted coordinates are reduced to cylindrical coordinates rotated with respect to the coordinates introduced above by angle @xmath19 and the forms ( [ eq9]-[eq12 ] ) coincide with the expressions ( [ eq6 ] ) .",
    "it is sufficient to have @xmath51 for ( [ eq9]-[eq12 ] ) to coincide with ( [ eq6 ] ) .",
    "clearly , this is due to the spherical symmetry of the schwarzschild space - time . ]",
    "the adjoint basis vectors @xmath52 are obtained from the duality condition @xmath53 .",
    "explicitly , we have @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57    in the limit of large @xmath1 the expressions ( [ eq9]-[eq16 ] ) tend to the corresponding expressions calculated for a flat space - time in @xcite .",
    "we project all our dynamical quantities and equations of motion onto the basis ( [ eq9]-[eq16 ] ) . in order to calculate covariant derivatives in this basis the connection coefficients , @xmath58 , should be used .",
    "their explicit forms are given in appendix a.    for our purposes we need covariant derivative of a vector and covariant divergence of a tensor projected onto the bases ( [ eq9]-[eq16 ] ) : @xmath59 where @xmath60 stands for covariant derivative .",
    "note that the indices of components of the tensor quantities as well as the ones of the connection coefficients projected onto our orthonormal bases can be raised and lowered with help of the minkowski metric @xmath61 .",
    "our equations of motion follow from the law of mass conservation @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the rest mass density , @xmath64 are components of four velocity , and equality to zero of covariant derivative of the stress energy tensor , @xmath65    we consider the stress energy tensor of a viscous radiative fluid @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the energy density and pressure , respectively , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the components of the metric and viscosity tensors , @xmath71 are the components of radiation flux .",
    "we have @xmath72 , where the thermal energy @xmath73 is assumed to be much smaller than the rest energy @xmath63 .",
    "the viscous stress tensor @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is dynamical viscosity , @xmath76 is the shear tensor and @xmath77 is the projection tensor .",
    "note that @xmath78    similar to the analysis of newtonian twisted discs in the fully relativistic case in the linear approximation in angle @xmath16 we can divide our equations of motion ( [ eq18 ] ) and ( [ eq19 ] ) in two parts having different symmetries with respect to the coordinates @xmath79 and @xmath80 : 1 ) a part describing an unperturbed flat disc and 2 ) a part describing the disc s perturbations associated with the disc s twist and warp .",
    "the first ( background ) part follows from standard models of relativistic flat disc accretion , where all dynamical quantities should be projected onto the basis ( [ eq13]-[eq16 ] ) with @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 formally set to zero .",
    "in this paper we would like to consider the simplest possible case of a relativistic geometrically thin optically thick stationary @xmath84disc as a background model , and use , accordingly , the results of @xcite , @xcite , hereafter nt , @xcite and @xcite , hereafter rh , to describe it .",
    "the perturbation part is treated in a way similar to what is done in @xcite , hereafter di , it is discussed in section 3 with some technical details relegated to appendix b.      for our purposes it is sufficient to consider only a few basic properties of the flat disc models .",
    "additionally , since we consider the case of a slowly rotating black hole in this section we neglect corrections due to a nonzero value of @xmath6 and discuss only accretion discs around a schwarzschild black hole , formally setting @xmath85 .",
    "however , certain basic expressions accounting for linear in @xmath6 corrections are shown in appendix b , for completeness .",
    "equations describing the relativistic flat disc models can themselves be split in two parts : the ones responsible for disc s structure and behaviour determined by effects occurring on a dynamical time scale and the ones determining the disc s structure and behaviour related to a slow viscous time scale .",
    "let us discuss the first group of equations temporarily neglecting viscous interaction between neighbouring rings of the disc . in this approximation",
    "the disc s gas is orbiting in the azimuthal direction with nearly geodesic four - velocity having only two components : @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "we use , accordingly , the standard expressions for geodesic circular motion in the field of a schwarzschild black hole @xmath88 where we set @xmath89 using the fact that we consider the disc situated close to the equatorial plane of a black hole and assume that the disc s gas is orbiting in positive direction with respect to the angle @xmath90 .",
    "an important quantity associated with the circular motion is its frequency with respect to a distant observer , @xmath91 . from equation ( [ eq23 ] ) we get @xmath92    the disc structure in the vertical direction is governed by equation of hydrostatic balance @xmath93 where we neglect @xmath94 .",
    "viscous interactions in the disc result in a slow drift of the disc s gas in the radial direction , and , accordingly , an additional radial component of four velocity , @xmath95 , appears .",
    "equations determining disc s properties related to this effect follow from the laws of conservation of the rest mass , energy and angular momentum , radiation transfer in the vertical direction and properties of viscous interactions in the disc .",
    "they allow one to complete the set of equations of the disc structure and obtain explicit expressions for basic quantities describing the disc .",
    "let us discuss some of these equations relevant for our purposes .",
    "the law of the rest mass conservation may be written in the form @xmath96 where the surface density @xmath97 and the rate of flow of the rest mass through the disc , @xmath98 , is a constant .    in the flat disc s models",
    "only @xmath99 and @xmath100 components of the viscous stress tensor are important . as is shown in nt and @xcite",
    "( see also rh ) the laws of energy and angular momentum conservation result in an explicit expression for integrated over the vertical coordinate @xmath99-component of the stress tensor . also ,",
    "integration of this component in these papers is performed over the proper vertical length @xmath101 , see ( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain a vertically integrated value of @xmath102 the nt and rh result should be additionally divided by @xmath103 . ]",
    "@xmath104 where the bar stands hereafter for vertically integrated quantities , @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "note that @xmath107 at the marginally stable orbit , when @xmath108 , where the disc truncates .",
    "the value of @xmath109 is obtained from ( [ eqn22 ] ) : @xmath110 . from ( [ eq21 ] ) and ( [ eq23 ] ) it follows another expression for @xmath111 , @xmath112 equating ( [ eq28 ] ) to ( [ eq26nn ] )",
    "we get @xmath113 taking into account that when @xmath114 the expression in the brackets tends to unity we get the well known result that @xmath115 is a constant in the nonrelativistic limit .    for our purposes",
    "we need an expression for kinematic viscosity @xmath116 . in this paper",
    "we employ the simplest possible approach assuming that @xmath117 does not depend on the vertical coordinate @xmath79 and use the standard @xcite and @xcite prescription for an estimate of this quantity assuming that it is proportional to the product of a characteristic disc scale height and sound speed , @xmath118 , in the disc @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the proper scale height of the disc related to a coordinate , @xmath5 , of the disc upper boundary in our coordinate system as @xmath121 , and @xmath9 is the usual shakura - sunyaev parameter .",
    "it is assumed to be a constant . from the hydrostatic balance equation ( [ eq25 ] ) it follows that @xmath122 . substituting this relation to ( [ eq30 ] )",
    "we finally define @xmath0 in such a way that @xmath123 using equations ( [ eq29 ] ) and ( [ eq30n ] ) we obtain an important relation @xmath124    finally , we are going to use the ratio @xmath125 in our calculations",
    ". it can be easily obtained from the results of nt provided that one takes into account a correction to the vertical balance equation of nt found in rh .",
    "when the disc is gas pressure dominated and the main source of opacity is determined by the thomson scattering , we have @xmath126 and for the gas pressure dominated disc with the free - free processes giving the main source of opacity we get @xmath127 where @xmath128 is a constant .",
    "note that in both cases @xmath129 at the marginally stable orbit .",
    "it is also important to note that the disc opening angle @xmath130 so defined does not depend on whether we use the boyer - lindquist or the isotropic coordinates .",
    "indeed , taking into account that @xmath131 and @xmath132 we have @xmath133 .",
    "the expressions for the flat nt model listed above are strictly valid only when the radial drift velocity is small : @xmath134 .",
    "this inequality is , however , broken when @xmath135 is small , and , when @xmath136 is very close to the position of the last stable orbit @xmath137 . assuming that the nt expressions can also give order of magnitude estimates even when @xmath138 let us estimate a value of @xmath139 , @xmath140 , where we have @xmath141 .",
    "the expression for @xmath142 follows from equations ( [ eq26 ] ) and ( [ eq30nn ] ) , @xmath143 while the speed of sound may be estimated as @xmath144 , see above . assuming that the new radial variable @xmath139 is small we have from ( [ eq27 ] ) @xmath145 we represent the quantity @xmath146 as @xmath147 , where @xmath148 , and @xmath149 , @xmath150 for the cases of the disc opacity dominated by the thomson scattering and free - free processes , respectively , see ( [ eq31 ] ) and ( [ eq32 ] ) . in the same limit",
    "we can set the values of all variables entering ( [ eqmm1 ] ) and the expression for @xmath151 excepting @xmath146 and @xmath152 equal to their values at @xmath10 .",
    "we get @xmath153 where we use ( [ eqmm2 ] ) . from this equation",
    "we obtain @xmath154 this equation tells that for typical values of @xmath0 and @xmath155 ( see e.g. @xcite , their equation ( 1 )  ) the value of @xmath140 is quite small .",
    "as described above we use equations ( [ eq19 ] ) written in the basis ( [ eq13]-[eq16 ] ) to obtain equations determining dynamics and stationary configurations of a twisted disc and we take into account that our assumption about smallness of the inclination angle @xmath16 allows us to decouple the set of equation ( [ eq19 ] ) onto two subsets : 1 ) the subset of equations describing the standard flat relativistic disc reviewed above ( the `` standard subset '' ) and 2 ) an additional set of equations determining propagation of warped and twisted disturbances through the disc and shapes of non - planar stationary configurations ( we call it later as a subset describing the disc twist ) . all equations of this additional subset depend harmonically on the angle @xmath156 ( or @xmath80 ) and can be obtained from the general set ( [ eq19 ] ) by a procedure employing symmetry of different terms in ( [ eq19 ] ) with respect to the vertical coordinate @xmath79 since in the approximation we use all terms in this subset are either even or odd with respect to the change @xmath157 . namely , let us call the equations of ( [ eq19 ] ) having the index @xmath158 as `` the horizontal part of equations '' and the equation with @xmath159 as `` the vertical equation '' .",
    "then , all terms of the horizontal part having the odd symmetry and all terms of the vertical equation having the even symmetry belong to the subset of equations describing the disc twist while all terms with the opposite symmetries belong to the standard subset .",
    "there are additional simplifications determined by the fact that we consider only the thin discs @xmath160 and slowly rotating black holes with @xmath14 .",
    "the first assumption allows us to consider only terms of order of @xmath161 in the horizontal part and terms of zero and second order in @xmath161 in the vertical equation .",
    "in fact , as we are going to show there is only one zero order term in the vertical equation describing precession of the disc rings due to the lense - thirring effect ( the so - called lense - thirring or gravitomagnetic precession ) .",
    "it is , therefore , proportional to @xmath6 .",
    "thus , this zero order term may also be classified as a `` small '' one due to our second assumption .",
    "a further simplification follows from the fact that the pressure @xmath68 , the thermal density @xmath73 and the dynamic viscosity @xmath162 are small in comparison with @xmath63 : @xmath163 .",
    "thus , these quantities enter in the horizontal part only in expressions containing differentiation over @xmath79 in order to provide terms linear in @xmath161 . in the vertical equation we set @xmath164 due to the same assumption .",
    "this results in absence of @xmath73 in all our expressions used below , see appendix b.    the second assumption allows us to suppose that a characteristic evolution time scale of propagation of twisted and warped disturbances through the disc , @xmath165 , is much larger than the disc dynamical time scale @xmath166 . indeed , for a non - rotating black hole with @xmath85",
    "the disc rings inclined with respect to each other can change their mutual orientations only due to interactions determined by either pressure or viscous forces . due to our first assumption",
    "these interactions are small and the corresponding time scales must be proportional to an inverse power of @xmath161 .",
    "for a slowly rotating black hole there is an additional characteristic time scale , @xmath167 , determined by the gravitomagnetic precession of the rings .",
    "it may be estimated as @xmath168 , see e.g. equation ( [ 2a11 ] ) . due to the small ratios @xmath169 and @xmath170 the time derivatives of the euler angles , and , accordingly , the variable @xmath82 defined in ( [ eqn8 ] ) can be neglected in all expressions entering in the horizontal part .    as was first noted by @xcite , hereafter pp , for the newtonian problem in order to get a self - consistent set of equations describing the disc twist one must take into account perturbations of velocity , gas density and pressure determined by the twisted disturbances in the disc . in our relativistic generalisation we must use perturbations of four - velocity , and , accordingly , assume that @xmath171 where the quantities with index @xmath172 are determined by the equations of the flat disc model described above . note that in a self - consistent approach we should consider perturbations of the dynamical viscosity , @xmath173 , and radiation flux , @xmath174 , as well .",
    "however , it can be shown that contribution of terms proportional to the unperturbed part of radiation flux , its perturbation and perturbation of the dynamical viscosity , is negligible in our equations at the required order of accuracy .",
    "this is related to the fact that the quantities @xmath175 and @xmath176 are proportional to @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "as we discuss above the terms proportional to @xmath177 give a contribution to the horizontal part of our equations being differentiated over @xmath79 and in the vertical part being multiplied by terms of zero order in @xmath161 .",
    "a direct examination of our set of the perturbed equations shows that this , in fact , does not happen in the linear approximation in angle @xmath179 .",
    "also note that the pressure perturbation @xmath180 does not enter in our set of final equations describing a twisted disc , see the next section .",
    "since both @xmath64 and @xmath181 obey the same normalisation condition @xmath182 the velocity perturbations @xmath183 are orthogonal to @xmath184 : @xmath185 , giving @xmath186 .",
    "the `` horizontal '' velocity perturbations @xmath187 are odd functions of @xmath79 while the `` vertical '' perturbation @xmath188 is an even function of the same coordinate .",
    "the horizontal part of the velocity perturbation is directly determined from our equations for the disc twist , see below .",
    "determination of the vertical part , @xmath188 requires some additional consideration .",
    "namely , as was first shown for the newtonian problem by @xcite , @xmath188 consists of two parts : @xmath189 , the first one is determined by a change of the coordinate @xmath79 with time of a given gas element while the second one is due to the non - coordinate character of our basis vectors ( [ eq13]-[eq16 ] ) .",
    "this results in evolution of projection of the velocity vector @xmath183 onto the vector @xmath190 even when a gas element has a fixed value of @xmath79 provided that either the euler angles are changing with time or there is a non - zero drift velocity component @xmath191 . in order to find @xmath192",
    "let us assume that @xmath193 .",
    "in this case we have @xmath194 , where @xmath195 is given by equation ( [ eq12 ] ) , and @xmath196 is the line element .",
    "using this equation , taking into account that @xmath197 and @xmath198 , see equations ( [ eq9 ] ) and ( [ eq10 ] ) , respectively , we get @xmath199 in what follows we set @xmath193 . this requirement is related to a specific freedom of choice between different twisted coordinate systems corresponding to the same physical situation .",
    "indeed , in order to construct our twisted coordinate system we add two euler angles to the set of the state variables describing our physical system while the number of dynamical equations remains the same .",
    "therefore , in the twisted coordinate system there is a freedom of choice between different sets of dynamical variables satisfying the same equations , which must be fixed by an additional requirement .",
    "as was discussed in @xcite the requirement @xmath193 fixes this freedom and leads to a choice of the most appropriate twisted coordinate system , where perturbations of the state variables are minimal .",
    "since the unperturbed parts of our variables and the perturbations enter in a different way in all equations below , we omit for simplicity the index @xmath172 characterising the unperturbed variables from now on .",
    "the horizontal part of our equations and the vertical equation are shown in appendix b , see equations ( [ 2a1]-[2a3 ] ) and equation ( [ 2a4 ] ) , respectively .",

    "for that we would like to express the density perturbation @xmath212 and the velocity perturbation @xmath204 entering ( [ 2a4 ] ) through @xmath203 using equations ( [ eq35]-[eq37 ] ) . since the resonance combination of terms containing the time derivatives does not enter in the vertical equations we can set @xmath213 when operating with equations ( [ eq35]-[eq37 ] ) .",
