    "<S> we present measurements of the linear stark effect on the @xmath0i@xmath1 @xmath0i@xmath2 transition in an er@xmath3-doped proton - exchanged linbo@xmath4 crystalline waveguide and an er@xmath3-doped silicate fiber . </S>",
    "<S> the measurements were made using spectral hole burning techniques at temperatures below 4 k. we measured an effective stark coefficient @xmath5khz / v@xmath6 in the crystalline waveguide and @xmath7khz / v@xmath6 in the silicate fiber . </S>",
    "<S> these results confirm the potential of erbium doped waveguides for quantum state storage based on controlled reversible inhomogeneous broadening .    </S>",
    "<S> because of their narrow homogenous line widths and corresponding long optical coherence times at low temperatures , rare - earth doped crystals ( re doped crystals ) have been the subject of much investigation for photon - echo based optical data storage and data processing @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , there has been additional interest in re doped crystals , spurred by proposals to extend their use to applications in the fast developing field of quantum communication and computation @xcite . in particular , re doped crystals are a promising material for the realization of a reversible transfer of quantum states between photons and atoms . </S>",
    "<S> such a quantum memory represents a basic building block for the so - called quantum repeater @xcite , which allows the extension of quantum communications schemes such as quantum cryptography @xcite to unlimited distances .    </S>",
    "<S> a original proposal for a quantum , as well as classical , memory in solid state material is based on controlled reversible inhomogeneous broadening ( crib ) of a narrow , spectrally isolated absorption line @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this protocol requires an atomic ensemble with a large optical depth , a long optical coherence time , and the ability to inhomogeneously broaden a single absorption line in the ensemble in a controlled and reversible way .    </S>",
    "<S> erbium doped waveguides are promising materials for the realization of crib , as interaction lengths ranging from many cm ( in the case of crystalline waveguides ) , to hundreds of meters or more ( in the case of amorphous optical fibers ) can easily be achieved , allowing for large absorption even at low doping concentrations . </S>",
    "<S> the 1.5 @xmath8 m , @xmath0i@xmath1 @xmath0i@xmath2 , transition in er@xmath3 is well matched to standard telecommunication fiber , which would allow simple interfacing of such a memory in a fiber communication network . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , recent investigations show that coherence times on the scale of @xmath8s can be obtained in er@xmath3 doped silicate fibers @xcite , and on the order of ms in er@xmath3 doped crystals @xcite . in this article </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the linear stark effect for the realization of crib in two different erbium doped waveguides , a crystalline linbo@xmath4 waveguide and a silicate optical fiber . </S>",
    "<S> our results confirm the potential of erbium doped waveguides for crib - based data storage .    in the presence of an external dc electric field , </S>",
    "<S> the energy levels of an atom with a permanent dipole moment are shifted ; this phenomenon is known as the linear dc stark effect . </S>",
    "<S> if the dipole moments are different for different electronic levels this shift leads to a shift in the associated optical transition frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the linear dc stark effect can be observed in re doped solids , where the dipole moment in the ion is induced by local electric fields . </S>",
    "<S> it has been measured for the @xmath0i@xmath1 @xmath9h@xmath10 transition in er@xmath3:linbo@xmath4 @xcite and er@xmath3,mg@xmath11:linbo@xmath4 @xcite crystals , using a differential technique @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition the effect has been measured in re doped bulk crystals such as eu@xmath3:yalo@xmath4 @xcite , pr@xmath3:ysio@xmath12 @xcite , pr@xmath3:yalo@xmath4 @xcite and pr@xmath3:laf@xmath4 @xcite as well as in sm@xmath11 doped borate bulk glass @xcite , an amorphous material . in order to achieve high sensitivity in the latter measurements , spectral hole burning techniques @xcite are used to isolate the effect of an electric field on a single homogenous line within an inhomogeneously broadened ensemble of atoms . </S>",
    "<S> to the best of our knowledge no measurements have been reported on re doped waveguides , neither crystalline nor amorphous .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider the linear stark effect where the transition frequency , @xmath13 , of an ion is shifted by the electric field according to the formula ,    @xmath14    here @xmath15 is the difference between the permanent electric dipole moments of the two states connected by the transition , @xmath16 is the applied dc electric field , @xmath17 is the lorentz correction factor , @xmath18 is the dielectric constant of the sample , and @xmath19 is the angle between the vectors @xmath20 and @xmath21 .    in a crystal , because of the ordered structure of the crystallin lattice , the dipole moments are aligned along a set of one or more well defined directions . </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry of the crystal along with the site symmetry at the rare - earth - ion position determines the number of directions . </S>",
    "<S> all ions with @xmath20 aligned along the same direction experience the same shift in their resonance frequency with an applied electric field and thus the application of a dc electric field leads to a shift or splitting of the spectral hole , depending on the number of possible directions . </S>",
    "<S> the projection of @xmath15 between the two states , along the direction of the applied electric field , can be determined by measuring the shift of the hole as a function of the electric field , as given by equation [ stark ] .    in an amorphous material , such as an optical fiber </S>",
    "<S> , the dipole moments are randomly orientated , such that the projection of @xmath20 along the direction of the applied electric field varies continuously for different ions in the solid . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , rather than a shift or splitting of the spectral hole , one observes a broadening as the absorption frequencies shift by different amounts , in different directions . assuming a lorentzian spectral hole </S>",
    "<S> , one can derive the shape of the hole for a given applied electric field . </S>",
    "<S> here we make the following simplifying assumptions as proposed by bogner et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> first , the dipole moments are randomly orientated in the solid . </S>",
    "<S> second , there is a distribution of magnitudes of @xmath15 which can be described by a maxwell distribution :    @xmath22 .   </S>",
    "<S> \\label{dipoledistribution}\\ ] ]    here @xmath15 is the difference in dipole moment between the two states , and @xmath23 is the most likely value of this difference . </S>",
    "<S> note that the width of the distribution and the value of @xmath23 are not independent .    with these assumptions the shape of the spectral hole , _ </S>",
    "<S> h(x ) _ , under application of an electric field , is given by @xcite    @xmath24 *   \\nonumber \\\\   </S>",

    "<S> waveguides we used an monochromatic laser to excite er@xmath3 ions from the @xmath28 ground state to the @xmath29 excited state , thereby creating a spectral hole at the frequency of the laser . </S>",
    "<S> we then decreased the laser intensity and scanned the frequency around the initial burning frequency three times while measuring the transmitted light as a function of time . </S>",
    "<S> together with an independent time - to - frequency calibration of the laser scan , this yields three spectral hole profiles . during the first scan </S>",
    "<S> there was no applied electric field , for the second scan we applied an electric field across the sample , as described below . </S>",
    "<S> finally , for the third scan , we switched off the electric field to demonstrate the reversibility of the stark induced line shift .    the first sample , a single domain , z - cut , proton - exchanged linbo@xmath4 waveguide ( dimensions 1 mm thick , 6 mm long , 6 mm wide ) is doped with er@xmath3 ( 0.5 at % ) , and mgo ( 5 mol % ) . </S>",
    "<S> we mounted the waveguide between two metal electrodes spaced by 1 mm and cooled it to 3.8 k using a pulse tube cooler ( vericold technologies ) . </S>",
    "<S> light , linearly polarized along the crystal c@xmath4 symmetry axis , was injected and collected with standard optical fibers mounted on two xyz positioners ( attocube systems ) and aligned with the input and output of the waveguide . </S>",
    "<S> the c@xmath4 symmetry axis was oriented parallel to the applied electric field and perpendicular to the light propagation direction . </S>",
    "<S> in addition we applied a magnetic field of approximately 0.7 t parallel to the c@xmath4 symmetry axis to reduce the width of the spectral hole @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we performed hole burning experiments as described above , with applied voltages ranging from -200 to 200 v , using a scannable cw external cavity diode laser ( nettest , tunics plus ) at a wavelength of 1531.00 nm . to measure the spectral hole we scanned the laser over 1.2 ghz in 500 @xmath8s and measured the transmitted light with a photodiode ( newfocus , mod . </S>",

    "<S> the line is a linear fit to the data , which passes through the point ( 0,0 ) , and gives an effective dipole moment difference of @xmath5khz / v@xmath6 . </S>",

    "<S> the frequency shift of the spectral hole , relative to the zero field position , as a function of electric field is plotted in figure [ crystal ] . </S>",
    "<S> the line is a linear fit to the data which passes through the point ( 0,0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dipole moment difference can be calculated from the slope of the line according to equation [ stark ] . </S>",
    "<S> we find an effective dipole moment difference @xmath5khz / v@xmath6 . the inset graph in figure [ crystal ] shows the position of the spectral hole measured after switching off the electric field for each applied field ; the spectral hole returns to the initial zero field position . </S>",
    "<S> this , plus the opposite directional shifts that were observed with positive and negative voltages , confirms the reversibility of the stark effect .    the observed single - frequency shift of the absorption line , under application of an electric field in the direction of the c@xmath4 symmetry axis , reflects the lack of inversion symmetry in the linbo@xmath4 crystal . </S>",
    "<S> this property allows for a single dipole moment direction , in contrast to observations of a `` pseudo stark splitting '' @xcite in centrosymmetric crystals , where the inversion symmetry results in dipole moments pointing in opposite directions .    the second sample , a sio@xmath30 fiber ( ino , er 407 fiber ) is doped as follows : er 0.07 ( at % ) , al 2.65 ( at % ) , ge ( 3.62 at % ) . the fiber ( length 65 cm ) was coiled with a diameter of 4 cm and sandwiched between two round metal electrodes spaced by 0.3 mm . </S>",
    "<S> we placed the sample in a @xmath31he/@xmath0he dilution refrigerator and cooled it to 50 mk . </S>",
    "<S> as the spectral hole width is sufficiently small at this temperature , application of a magnetic field was not necessary . </S>",
    "<S> we performed spectral hole burning experiments as described above , with applied voltages ranging from 0 to 120 v , using a cw external cavity diode laser ( toptica , dl 100 ) at a wavelength of 1531 nm . to measure the spectral hole we scanned the laser over 400 mhz in 800 @xmath8s . </S>",

    "<S> figure ( a ) shows the spectral holes ( transmitted intensity as a function of frequency ) with different applied electric fields , the holes are shifted vertically for clarity . </S>",
    "<S> the points are measured data and the lines are a fit to equation 3 . </S>",
    "<S> figure ( b ) is a plot of the fitted @xmath32 values from figure ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the line is a linear fit to the data , which passes through the point ( 0,0 ) , and gives an effective dipole moment difference @xmath7khz / v@xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the inset graph in figure ( b ) shows the width of the spectral hole ( fwhm ) measured after the applied field is turned off . ]    the spectral hole for each applied electric field is plotted in figure [ fiber]a . </S>",
    "<S> the points are the measured data and the lines are fits using equation [ hole ] . we find a close agreement between the predicted and observed hole shapes . </S>",
    "<S> the values of @xmath33 obtained from the fits for each applied electric field are plotted in figure [ fiber]b . </S>",

    "<S> let us now discuss our results in view of the controlled reversible inhomogeneous broadening required for the quantum memory proposal @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the broadening must be controllable in such a way that , starting with an ensemble of ions that absorb at @xmath34 , the transition frequency of the ion can be shifted to @xmath35 and then , at a later time , shifted again to @xmath36 , where @xmath37 varies continuously over the necessary bandwidth . for the storage of light pulses with a duration of 10ns , for example , the required frequency bandwidth is on the order of 100 mhz . in the crystal </S>",
    "<S> this broadening could be achieved by applying a position dependent electric field along the crystal , ranging from + 2 kv @xmath6 to 2 kv @xmath6 . in the fiber , </S>",
    "<S> the application of a spatially homogeneous electric field of approximately 3.5 kv @xmath6 is sufficient as it directly leads to a broadening of the spectral hole . in both the fiber and the crystal , switching the polarity of the applied field </S>",
    "<S> should reverse the broadening in the required way .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have presented measurements of the linear dc stark effect in an er@xmath3-doped proton - exchanged linbo@xmath4 waveguide , and an er@xmath3 doped silicate telecom fiber . </S>",
    "<S> we found effective dipole moment differences of @xmath5khz / v@xmath6 and @xmath7khz / v@xmath6 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these measurements demonstrate the suitability of er@xmath3 doped waveguides for solid state quantum memory protocols based on controlled reversible inhomogeneous broadening . </S>"
