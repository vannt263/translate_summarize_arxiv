    "in 1933 goeritz @xcite described a set of automorphisms of the standard unknotted genus two handlebody in @xmath0 , each of which extends to all of @xmath0 .",
    "he further observed that any such automorphism is a product of elements of this finite set .",
    "stated somewhat differently , goeritz identified a finite set of generators for the group @xmath2 , defined as isotopy classes of orientation - preserving homeomorphisms of the @xmath3-sphere that leave a genus two heegaard splitting invariant .",
    "goeritz theorem was generalized to heegaard splittings of aribtrarily high genus by powell @xcite , but the proof contains a serious gap . divides the handle , there are two adjacent ones that each contain pieces of @xmath4 .",
    "there is no apparent reason why this should be true .",
    "] so a foundational question remains unresolved : is the group of automorphisms of the standard genus @xmath5 heegaard splitting of @xmath0 finitely generated and , if so , what is a natural set of generators .",
    "the finite set of elements that powell proposes as generators remains a very plausible set .",
    "since the gap in powell s proof has escaped attention for 25 years , goeritz original theorem might itself be worth a second look .",
    "in addition , his argument is difficult for the modern reader to follow , is published in a fairly inaccessible journal and is a bit old - fashioned in its outlook . in view of the use that has been made of it in recent work on tunnel number one knots ( cf @xcite , @xcite ) it seems worthwhile to present an updated proof , in hopes also that it might be relevant to the open analogous problem for heegaard splittings of higher genus .",
    "the purpose of this note is to present such a proof , one influenced by the idea of thin position .",
    "one way to describe the outcome of this investigation is this : there is a natural @xmath1-complex @xmath6 ( which deformation retracts to a graph ) on which @xmath2 acts transitively .",
    "one can write down an explicit finite presentation for the stabilizer @xmath7 of a vertex @xmath8 and observe that the stabilizer acts transitively on the edges of @xmath6 incident to @xmath9 .",
    "in particular , if we add to @xmath7 any element @xmath10 of @xmath2 that takes @xmath9 to some adjacent vertex then the subgroup generated by @xmath7 and @xmath10 is exactly the subgroup that preserves the component in which @xmath9 lies .",
    "this in fact is all of @xmath2 , because it turns out that @xmath6 is connected .",
    "the proof that @xmath6 is connected can be viewed as the core argument in this paper .",
    "we outline the general setting , referring the reader to ( * ? ? ?",

    "let @xmath11 denote the standard unknotted genus - two handlebody in @xmath0 , with closed complement @xmath12 also a genus two handlebody .",
    "let @xmath2 denote the group of orientation - preserving homeomorphisms of @xmath0 that preserve @xmath11 .",
    "regard two as equivalent if there is an isotopy from one to the other via isotopies that preserve @xmath11 .",
    "any orientation preserving homeomorphism of @xmath0 is isotopic to the identity , so an element @xmath13 of @xmath2 is isotopic , as a homeomorphism of @xmath0 , to the identity .",
    "this gives an alternate view of @xmath2 : an element of @xmath2 corresponds to an isotopy of @xmath0 from the identity to a homeomorphism that preserves @xmath11 setwise .",
    "for @xmath14 , @xmath15 is a genus two heegaard splitting of @xmath0 . in the language of heegaard splittings , a _ reducing sphere _",
    "@xmath16 is a sphere that intersects @xmath17 transversally in a single essential circle and so intersects each handlebody in a single essential disk . since @xmath18 is separating in @xmath0 , @xmath19 is a separating curve in @xmath17 , which we will denote @xmath20 .",
    "a straightforward innermost disk argument shows that @xmath18 is determined up to isotopy rel @xmath17 by the circle @xmath20 .",
    "suppose @xmath21 is another reducing sphere , with the circles @xmath20 and @xmath22 isotoped to intersect transversally and minimally in @xmath17 .",
    "then the number of points of intersection @xmath23 is denoted @xmath24 .",
    "clearly @xmath25 if and only if @xmath18 and @xmath21 are isotopic since the only separating essential curve in either punctured torus component of @xmath26 is boundary parallel . since reducing spheres are separating , @xmath24 is always even .",
    "an elementary argument ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 2.5 ) ) shows that @xmath27 and in some sense characterizes ( up to multiple half - dehn twists about @xmath20 ) all spheres @xmath21 so that @xmath28 .",
    "see figure [ fig : pandq ]    [ tbh ]     this suggests a useful simplicial complex : let @xmath6 be the complex in which each vertex represents an isotopy class of reducing spheres and a collection @xmath29 of reducing spheres bounds an @xmath30-simplex if and only if @xmath31 for all @xmath32 .",

    "it follows that for any two reducing spheres @xmath18 and @xmath21 there is an orientation preserving homeomorphism of @xmath0 , preserving @xmath11 as a set , that carries @xmath18 to @xmath21 .",
