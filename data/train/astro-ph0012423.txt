    "the general geometry of a gravitational lensing situation is shown in figure 1 : the light path between observer o and source s is affected by a mass l between them . in a ",
    "strong \" lensing situation  lens and source are well aligned  two ( or more ) images s@xmath0 and s@xmath1 of the background source can be produced .",
    "they are separated by an angle which is proportional to the square root of the lens mass ( see below ) . for typical galaxy masses",
    "this angle is of order arcseconds .    if the lens is a galaxy which consists partly of stars ( and other compact objects ) , due to the graininess of the main lens , each of these ( macro-)images consists of many micro - images , which are separated by angles of order microarcseconds , and hence unresolvable .",
    "however , due to the relative motion between source , lens and observer , the micro - image configuration changes with time , and so does the observable total magnification .    from figure 1",
    ", one can easily derive the lens equation ( all angles involved are small : @xmath2 ) : @xmath3 this relation reduces to @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the deflection angle for a point lens ( @xmath6 - gravitational constant ; @xmath7 - speed of light ; @xmath8 - impact parameter of light ray ; @xmath9  mass of the lens ; @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12  angular diameter distances between observer - lens , observer - source , lens - source ) .",
    "the positions of the images are the solutions of the quadratic equation for @xmath13 . for perfect alignment ,",
    "i.e. @xmath14 , the circular symmetric image has a radius of @xmath15 this defines the relevant angular scale for gravitational lensing , the angular einstein radius @xmath16 of the lens (  typical \" lens and source redshifts of @xmath17@xmath18 0.5 and @xmath19@xmath18 2.0 were assumed for the numerical values on the right hand side ) .     and s@xmath1 of a background source s.",
    "if the lens has substructure ( e.g. , stars in a galaxy ) each macro - image is split into many micro - images .",
    "only the total magnification of all the microimages is observable .",
    "( the symbols are explained in the text . ) , width=377 ]    this angular scale translates into a length scale in the source plane : @xmath20 the value on the right hand side is typical for galaxy masses .",
    "this type of  macro \"- lensing can be directly observed in form of multiply imaged quasars , with images separated by angles of order a few arcseconds .",
    "image splittings of microarcseconds corresponding to stellar mass lenses can obviously not be detected directly .",
    "what makes  microlensing \" observable anyway is the fact that observer , lens(es ) and source move relative to each other . due to this relative motion , the micro - image configuration changes with time , and so does the total magnification , i.e. the sum of the magnifications of all the micro - images . and this change in magnification over time can be measured : microlensing is a  dynamical \" phenomenon .",
    "there are two time scales involved : the standard lensing time scale @xmath21 is the time it takes the source to cross the einstein radius of the lens , i.e.    @xmath22 where the same typical assumptions are made as above , and the effective transverse velocity @xmath23 is parametrized in units of 600 km / sec .",
    "this time scale results in discouragingly large values .",
    "however , we can expect fluctations on much shorter time intervals , due to the fact that the magnification distribution is highly non - linear , the sharp caustic lines separate regions of low and high magnification .",
    "so if a source crosses such a caustic line , we will observe a large change in magnification during the time it takes the source to cross its own diameter :    @xmath24 here the quasar size @xmath25 is parametrized in units of @xmath26 cm .",
    "for a more detailled presentation of lensing , see schneider et al .",
    "gravitational lensing and interstellar scintillation are both propagation phenomena , and in fact these two physical effects have quite a number of aspects in common .",
    "this is graphically demonstrated in figure [ fig2 ] . in both cases ,",
    "a signal emitted by a distant source is affected by some intermediate medium , so that the observer receives a modified signal .",
    "the physical effect of the medium in both cases is the _ deflection of electromagnetic waves _ ( restricted wavelength range in the case of scintillation ) , which causes    1 .",
    "shift of image position , 2 .   apparent magnification or demagnification of a source ( relative to the unaffected situation ) , 3 .",
    "distorted image shape , 4 .",
    "time variability due to relative motion of source , medium and observer , and 5 .",
    "occasionally multiplicity of images .    both lensing and scintillation can be used to better understand intrinsic properties of the source : size , structure , variability , as well as properties of the  medium \" : size , mass , transverse velocity .",
    "the effect of the medium can be dominated by one relatively strong interaction ( single screen ) , or by a sum of many uncorrelated weak effects ( multi screen ) .       about 10% of the roughly 60 known multiply imaged quasars have a measured time delay .",
    "together with a model of the lensing galaxy , this provides a determination of the hubble constant .",
    "myers ( 1999 ) has summarized the latest situation : values of the hubble constant determined from gravitational lensing tend to be lowish ( around 65 km / s / mpc ) .",
    "uncorrelated fluctuations in multiply imaged quasars are interpreted as microlensing by stellar mass objects .",
    "it can be used to determine the structure of quasars and the mass of the lensing objects .",
    "( wambsganss 2000 ) .",
    "giant luminous arcs found in rich galaxy clusters provide strong support of large masses for these clusters , which means that they are dominated by dark matter .",
    "even clusters at redshifts close to one still show ( weak ) lensing effects on background galaxies ( mellier 1999 ) .",
    "einstein rings ",
    "annular images due to perfect alignment between lens and source  are mostly known in the radio regime . since they are  extended \" ,",
    "they provide many more constraints on the deflecting potential than a few point - images of quasars .",
    "hence the lensing galaxies of einstein rings are probably those with the most accurately determined masses and mass distributions ( kochanek , keeton & mcleod 2000 ) .",
    "the most recent development of gravitational lensing is the discovery of  cosmic shear \" , the very weak lensing effect of large scale structure on background souces . in a kind of stimulated emission , four groups presented their uncorrelated detections within a few days this spring : bacon , refregier & ellis ( 2000 ) , kaiser , wilson & luppino ( 2000 ) , van waerbecke et al .",
