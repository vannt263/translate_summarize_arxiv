    "the phenomenology related to the qcd confinement / deconfinement phase transition has been the subject of intense investigation , both experimentally and theoretically ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite for a review of the topic ) . in comparison to qcd however",
    ", less information is known about the finite - temperature behavior of generic yang - mills ( ym ) theories , _",
    "i.e. _ with an other gauge group than su(3 ) and matter in other representations than the fundamental one .",
    "several results about a pure ym theory can be mentioned .",
    "first , there still exists a first - order deconfining phase transition with the gauge groups g@xmath6 ,",
    "su(@xmath7 ) , sp(2 ) and e@xmath8 @xcite . second , the equation of state ( eos ) above the deconfining temperature @xmath1 , appears to be nearly independent of the gauge group once normalized to the stefan - boltzmann pressure @xcite .",
    "below @xmath1 , the eos seems to be compatible with a hagedorn - type density of state with the hagedorn temperature @xmath9 playing the role of @xmath1 @xcite .    among other extensions of ym theories ,",
    "a particularly challenging case is the one with one flavor of massless majorana fermions in the adjoint representation of the gauge group .",
    "such a theory is supersymmetric and is the @xmath10 susy ym theory @xcite , the adjoint quarks being called the gluinos . as in ordinary ym theory , the behavior of @xmath10 susy ym theory can be guessed from the @xmath11-function .",
    "it has been exactly computed from instanton calculus @xcite , and reads @xmath12 for an su(@xmath3 ) gauge group .",
    "this form is compatible with asymptotic freedom , and it appears that @xmath10 susy ym is confining at @xmath13 , as in the ordinary ym case .",
    "several studies have been thus devoted to compute its spectrum with the gauge groups su(@xmath3 ) @xcite . moreover",
    ", the theory is expected to exhibit a deconfining phase transition : recent lattice results indicate that it is indeed the case , at least for su(2 ) @xcite",
    ". this might be the case for an arbitrary gauge group too , according to @xcite . at very high temperatures finally",
    ", the deconfined phase is expected to behave as a conformal gas of gluons and gluinos @xcite .    a peculiarity of su(@xmath3 )",
    "@xmath10 susy ym is that it is equivalent to one - flavor qcd at large @xmath3 provided that quarks are in the two - indices antisymmetric representation of the gauge group , which is isomorphic to the fundamental one at @xmath14 .",
    "this duality is called orientifold duality and has attracted a lot of attention since the pioneering work @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of the present work is to study the thermodynamic features of the deconfined phase of @xmath10 susy ym theory by resorting to the formalism described in @xcite .",
    "this formalism is based on a @xmath2-matrix approach that allows to model the bound states and scattering states of the system in an unified way @xcite . from the @xmath2-matrix ,",
    "the eos can be computed by resorting to the dashen , ma and bernstein s formulation of statistical mechanics  @xcite .",
    "such a formulation is particularly well suited for systems whose microscopic constituents behave according to relativistic quantum mechanics : in our framework , the deconfined phase is seen as a strongly - interacting gas of gluons and gluinos propagating in the plasma .",
    "note that the approach described in @xcite has already proven to reproduce accurately the current lattice data concerning the eos of ordinary ym theory for the gauge groups su(@xmath3 ) .",

    "to describe the high - lying hadronic spectrum , hagedorn  @xcite proposed a model in which the number of hadrons with mass @xmath15 is found to increase as @xmath16 ( @xmath17 is real ) : the so - called hagedorn spectrum .",
    "thermodynamical quantities are then undefined for @xmath18 .",
    "it is then tempting to guess that @xmath9 is the deconfining temperature , @xmath1 above which the new degrees of freedom are deconfined quarks and gluons rather than hadrons .    besides hagedorn s original work",
    ", it is known that the degeneracy of string states versus their mass is also that of a hagedorn spectrum , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "this result has implications in ym theory : glueballs are indeed frequently modelled by closed strings since the celebrated isgur and paton s flux tube model @xcite , inspired from the hamiltonian formulation of lattice qcd at strong coupling .",
    "according to this closed - string picture of glueballs , it has been shown that the eos of pure su(3 ) ym theory computed on the lattice is compatible with a glueball gas model in which the high - lying spectrum is modelled by the one of a closed bosonic string  @xcite .    in the non - susy ym case ,",
    "identifying the critical temperature to the hagedorn temperature of a bosonic closed string theory in @xmath19-dimensions agrees well with currently known lattice data @xcite : @xmath20 . correspondingly , in @xmath0 susy ym , we conjecture that the hagedorn temperature should be that of a non - critical ( _ i.e. _ well - defined in a 4-dimensional spacetime ) closed superstring theory .",
    "such a theory has been studied in particular in @xcite , where the usual hagedorn temperature is recovered for the bosonic case and where the ratio @xmath21 is found for the superstring .",
    "interestingly the same value has been recently found in a su(2 ) lattice simulation of @xmath0 susy ym thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "equation  ( [ tc ] ) thus provides an explanation to this value , finally leading us to the result @xmath22 that will be used throughout this paper .",
    "the results of ma , dashen and bernstein @xcite establishing the grand potential of an interacting relativistic particle gas , @xmath23 , expressed as an energy density , are summarized by the following virial expansion ( in units where @xmath24 ) .",
    "@xmath25\\text{.}\\ ] ] in this equation , the first term , @xmath26 , is the grand potential of the free relativistic particles .",
    "the second term accounts for interactions in the plasma and is a sum running on all the species , the number of particles included , and the quantum numbers necessary to fix a channel .",
    "the set of all these channels is generically denoted @xmath27 .",
    "the vectors @xmath28 and @xmath29 contain the chemical potentials and the particle number of each species taking part in a given scattering channel .    in",
    ", we can notice that the contribution of the bound states and scattering states are decoupled .",
    "below the threshold @xmath30 ( the threshold is a summation on the mass of all the particles included in a given channel @xmath27 ) , bound states appearing in the @xmath31-matrix spectrum are added as free additional species : @xmath32 is the grand canonical potential describing an ideal relativistic gas of the @xmath27-channel bound states . above @xmath30 ,",
    "the scattering contribution is expressed as an integration depending on a trace , taken in the center of mass frame of the particles in the channel @xmath27 , and is a function of the @xmath31-matrix , @xmath31 , of the system .",
    "@xmath31 is in particular a function of the total energy @xmath33 .",
    "the symmetrizer @xmath34 enforces the pauli principle when a channel involving identical particles is considered , and the subscript @xmath35 means that only the connected scattering diagrams are taken into account .",
    "@xmath36 is the modified bessel function of the second kind and @xmath37 where @xmath2 is the temperature .",
    "the notation @xmath38 denotes @xmath39 .    by definition",
    ", @xmath31 is linked to the off - shell @xmath2-matrix , @xmath40 , by the relation @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the free hamiltonian of the system .",
    "a way to obtain @xmath40 in two - body channels is to solve the lippmann - schwinger equation , schematically given by @xmath43 with @xmath44 the free propagator and @xmath45 the interaction potential . at this point",
    "we have to mention that , since we will focus on two - body channels only , the lippmann - schwinger equation is the relevant one to use . in three - body channels for example",
    ", faddeev equations should be used instead in order to eliminate the spurious solution of the lippmann - schwinger equation @xcite .    once eq .",
    "( [ pot0 ] ) is computed , all thermodynamic observables can be derived .",
    "for example , the pressure is simply given by @xmath46    the sum @xmath47 appearing in ( [ pot0 ] ) explicitly reads @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the number of particles involved in the interaction process , @xmath50 is a possible isospin channel , @xmath51 is the color channel , and @xmath52 is the spin / helicity channel ( the labels @xmath53 or @xmath54 must be dropped off if the charge conjugation or the parity are not defined ) . as in @xcite ,",
    "we assume that the dominant scattering processes are the two - body ones , and thus we only consider @xmath55 .    the normalized trace anomaly can also be computed by the following formula @xmath56 within this paper , we will give some results about the trace anomaly , as an indication .",
    "it is indeed mentioned in @xcite that some improvements must be done in order to obtain a reliable estimation of this quantity .",
    "a key ingredient of the present approach is the 2-body potential @xmath45 , encoding the interactions between the particles in the plasma .",
    "@xmath45 is chosen as in @xcite : it is extracted from the free energy @xmath57 between a @xmath58 pair at finite temperature , computed in quenched su(3 ) lqcd @xcite .",
    "note that unquenched results are available , but only small differences appear with respect to quenched calculations @xcite .    for the needs of our approach",
    ", this free energy has been fitted with a cornell potential screened thanks to the debye - hckel theory @xcite ( see appendix  b in @xcite ) .",
    "however as in @xcite , we prefer to use the internal energy @xmath59 as the interaction potential .",
    "this choice is still a matter of debate .",
    "nevertheless , it has given correct results in the ordinary ym case , as shown in @xcite .",
    "the casimir scaling seems very well respected between two static color sources in the @xmath13 sector @xcite .",
    "computations in the @xmath60 sector show a situation which is slightly different : the casimir scaling seems partly violated ( at most 20% ) for short distances and temperatures near @xmath1 @xcite . in this work , as in @xcite , we assume that the casimir scaling is verified .",
    "we use the lattice @xmath58-potential , as proposed in sec .",
    "ii in @xcite , and we rescale the color dependence to obtain the following form @xmath61 ,   \\label{used_pot}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 and where @xmath63 is the quadratic casimir of the representation @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath65 , adj , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 stand respectively for the pair , adjoint , singlet , @xmath69- and @xmath70-particle representation .",
    "for instance , @xmath71 for the su(@xmath3 ) gauge group , where @xmath72 denotes the fundamental representation .",
    "the values taken by ( [ color_scaling ] ) for the various color channels considered in this paper are given in tables [ tab : c0]-[tab : c3 ] in appendix  [ colorchan ] .",
    "let us note the presence of @xmath73 , since @xmath74 is fitted on a singlet @xmath58 potential for su(3 ) @xcite .",
    "the color dependence respecting the casimir scaling is the simplest form possible for two color sources .",
    "it has the same form as the one for the one - gluon exchange process , but our interaction contains other processes since it stems from a lqcd computation . in this work , all hyperfine interactions are neglected .",
    "we can expect that they are non - dominant with respect to the spin - independent contributions , since these processes are assumed to depend on the inverse square of the effective mass .",
    "with this hypothesis , we also miss the diagonal annihilation contributions .",
    "let us note that the annihilation mechanism , which does not respect the casimir scaling , is a contact interaction and is then vanishing for all non - s states .    in ,",
    "the long - distance behavior of the lattice potential @xmath75 , is subtracted since this term is assimilated , as suggested in @xcite , as a thermal mass contribution for the quasiparticles ( this also ensures the convergence of the scattering equation and the possibility to perform the fourier transform ) . indeed , when the quasiparticles are infinitely separated , the only remaining potential energy can be seen as a manifestation of the in - medium self - energy effects , @xmath76 .",
    "we thus encode these effects as a mass shift @xmath77 to the  bare \" quasiparticle mass @xmath78 , by following the arguments exposed in @xcite : @xmath79 where @xmath78 is independent of @xmath2 . in order to get the thermal mass for any particles ,",
    "we extract the first - order color dependence in agreement with the hard - thermal - loop ( htl ) leading - order behavior @xcite : @xmath80 where the quantity @xmath81 is assumed to be color - independent . as @xmath74 is fitted on a singlet @xmath58 potential for su(3 ) , we have here @xmath82 in particular , @xmath83 for the gluon and the gluino since they both belong to the adjoint representation of the gauge group .",
    "it comes naturally that @xmath77 for these particles is gauge - group independent in our model .",
    "looking at the behavior of @xmath84 ( see sec .",
    "v in @xcite ) , it can be seen that the particles become more and more light with increasing values of @xmath2 .",
    "so , they are less and less influenced by the short range part of the interaction ( where the casimir scaling is less satisfied ) . moreover , in this case , the casimir scaling is more and more satisfied .",
    "so we can expect that the fundamental hypothesis of our model is better verified at high values of @xmath2 .",
    "having established the quasiparticle properties , we have now all the ingredients to solve the lippman - schwinger equation leading to the on - shell @xmath2-matrix . it can be computed from ( [ ls ] ) as follows in @xcite : @xmath85 \\left[1 \\pm f_{p_2}(\\epsilon_2)\\right ] , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the energy in the center - of - mass frame , @xmath86 the asymptotic energy of the particle @xmath69 , and where the free two - body propagator is given by  ( [ g0 ] ) .",
    "the symbol @xmath27 stands for the particular channel considered .",
    "for ordinary @xmath87 states , @xmath88 is given by the fourier transform of the interaction @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the legendre polynomial of order @xmath91 , and @xmath92 with @xmath93 the angle between the momenta @xmath94 and @xmath95 . the spin @xmath31 is not indicated since our interaction is spin - independent .",
    "our potential has a spherical symmetry .",
    "we have then @xmath96 where @xmath97 .",
    "when at least one particle is transverse , we have to use the helicity formalism @xcite .",
    "it is very convenient to use , since a particular helicity state @xmath98 can be written as ( see appendix  [ helicity ] ) @xmath99 then , it can be shown that @xmath100 since our interaction is spin - independent .",
    "contrary to the @xmath2-matrix equation used in @xcite , we have included the in - medium effects , namely the bose - enhancement and the pauli - blocking . according to @xcite , these in - medium effects",
    "change the cross - section as follows , @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are respectively the cross - section in the vacuum and in the medium , and where @xmath104 is the distribution function of the @xmath105-species . if the species is a boson ,",
    "@xmath106 while if the species is a fermion , @xmath107 where @xmath108 is a possible chemical potential .",
    "the sign choice in ( [ med_effects ] ) also depends on the nature of the particles : @xmath109 for bosons and @xmath110 for fermions .",
    "let us note that these in - medium effects have a very small influence on the eos in our computations .",
    "therefore , the results obtained in @xcite remain valid .",
    "the haftel - tabakin algorithm is used to solve ( [ tosolve ] ) @xcite .",
    "the momentum integral is discretized within an appropriate quadrature , thus turning the integral equation in a matrix equation , namely , @xmath111 , where , schematically @xcite , @xmath112 and @xmath113 denotes the integration weight .",
    "the solution follows trivially by matrix inversion .",
    "it can be shown that the determinant of the transition function @xmath114 ( referred to as the fredholm determinant ) vanishes at the bound state energies , which provides a numerical criterion for solving the bound state problem .",
    "this strategy has already been successfully used to compute @xmath2-matrices in @xcite .",
    "once @xmath115 is known , the on - shell @xmath2-matrix is readily obtained as @xmath116 , with @xmath117 given by ( [ diff_mass ] ) .",
    "the haftel - tabakin algorithm is a reliable procedure to solve the @xmath2-matrix problem @xcite .",
    "recently , invoking the levinson s theorem , it has been shown that keeping only the bound - state spectrum in thermodynamical computations leads to strong violations of unitarity @xcite . in our calculations , we take into account the continuum as well the bound states , in order to keep unitarity . in a previous work @xcite , we have checked that the number of nodes that @xmath118 presents in the scattering region changes in parallel with the number of bound states .",
    "these behaviors are the reflections of levinson s theorem in our calculation .",

    "@xmath50 is the isospin of the particle , @xmath120 is the dimension of the spin / helicity representation , and @xmath121 is the dimension of the color representation .",
    "moreover , @xmath122 is the grand potential per degree of freedom associated to a bosonic species with mass @xmath15 , while @xmath123 is the grand potential per degree of freedom associated to a fermionic species with mass @xmath15 . for later convenience",
    ", the thermodynamic quantities will be normalized to the stefan - boltzmann pressure , which is defined as @xmath124    attractive interactions in a particular channel @xmath27 can lead to the formation of bound states with masses @xmath125 .",
    "as mentioned above , the energy of these states can be computed by looking at the zeros of the determinant of the transition function @xmath114 .",
    "they contribute also to the grand potential as new species via the formula @xmath126 in this sum , @xmath127 if no bound state exists in the channel @xmath27 at a given value of @xmath2 .",
    "the full form of the scattering part of ( [ pot0 ] ) is given in appendix  [ diff ] and is not recalled here for the sake of clarity .",
    "for obvious numerical reasons , all the possible channels contributing to @xmath23 can not be included into the sum  ( [ pot0 ] ) .",
    "so we need reliable criteria to select the most significant channels .",
    "when the total spin @xmath128 increases , the average value @xmath129 increases also .",
    "this is obvious for ordinary spin states , and this is shown in appendix  [ helicity ] for helicity states . for a bound state ,",
    "this means the increase of the mass , and then a reduced contribution to the grand potential .",
    "moreover , in a naive nonrelativistic picture , the strength of the orbital barrier increases with @xmath129 in a scattering process , which reduces the value of the corresponding @xmath2-matrix  ( [ tosolve ] ) ( see appendix  [ cross ] ) .",
    "so we decided to restrict the sum  ( [ pot0 ] ) to channels with the lowest values of @xmath129 .",
    "more precisely , a mean cross section @xmath130 is computed for each channel ( see appendix  [ cross ] ) .",
    "are only retained , the channels for which the value of @xmath130 is at least 25% of the value @xmath130 for the channel with the lowest value of @xmath129 . in this case , nearly all states with @xmath131 are retained in the sum .",
    "we have checked that the value of 25% is a good compromise between accuracy and computational effort .",
    "for instance , the inclusion of all @xmath132 states up to @xmath133 brings very weak modifications to the pressure , as it can be seen on fig .",
    "[ selection ] .",
    "channels : all @xmath52 channels considered in this paper with our criteria given above ( circle ) ; all channels such that @xmath134 ( square ) . parameters are given in sec . [ secparam ] , except for @xmath135  mev @xcite .",
    ", scaledwidth=70.0% ]      with the formalism described above , it is possible to compute bound states within the plasma ( see sec .  [ lseq ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is also interesting to compute bound states at @xmath13 , in order to check the validity of our model . in quenched su(3 ) lattice qcd , the potential between a static quark - antiquark pair at zero temperature is compatible with the funnel form @xcite @xmath137 where @xmath138 and @xmath139  gev@xmath140 ( standard values for the running coupling constant @xmath141 and the string tension @xmath142 at @xmath13 ) .",
    "again , we neglect the contributions of annihilation processes .",
    "since the fourier transform of @xmath143 is not defined ( because of a nonzero asymptotic value ) , a string - breaking value , @xmath144 , is introduced to make it convergent .",
    "@xmath144 is thus seen as the energy above which a light quark - antiquark pair can be created from the vacuum and breaks the qcd string .",
    "this scale is then subtracted and the potential effectively taken into account is @xmath145 , while @xmath146 is interpreted as an effective quark mass using the same arguments as those detailed in sec .",
    "[ properties ] @xcite .    according to the color scaling ( [ color_scaling ] ) ,",
    "the potential describing the interactions between two color sources ( with representations @xmath64 and @xmath147 ) at zero temperature , and thus only in a singlet gauge representation ( @xmath148 ) since confinement is present , is @xmath149 let us recall that the factor @xmath150 appears since the potential @xmath151 is fitted on a singlet @xmath58 pair for su(3 ) . in this case ,",
    "@xmath152 should rather be interpreted as the energy scale necessary to form two sources of color compatible with the existence of the two new color singlet pairs of particles created by the string breaking .",
    "for instance , it is expected that two gluelumps can be formed for the breaking of a string between two gluons ( a gluelump is a gluon bound in the color field of a static adjoint source ) .",

    "now , we will particularize the general formalism presented in the previous section for an @xmath10 susy ym theory . in such a theory",

    "both particles have a vanishing isospin .",
    "note that the nonsupersymmetric case was treated in @xcite .",
    "the gluons are transverse spin-1 bosons in the adjoint representation of the gauge group and thus , since the gluinos are their supersymmetric partners , they are majorana fermions of spin 1/2 belonging to the same representation .",
    "the two - body channels to be considered are @xmath132 , @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "the lowest corresponding spin / helicity states are given in appendix [ helicity ] , and the possible color channels can be found in appendix  [ colorchan ] .",
    "the possible interactions are then diagonal ones in @xmath132 , @xmath157 and @xmath158 pairs , as well as transition processes between @xmath132 and @xmath157 pairs .",
    "let us examine the different possibilities :    * as explained above , the interaction ( [ used_pot ] ) between two gluons or two gluinos follows strictly the casimir scaling and neglects all hyperfine corrections , annihilation ones included . *",
    "although this interaction is expected to take into account complicated exchanges ( since it stems from a lqcd calculation ) , it is interesting to look at the simplest possible feynman diagrams between two particles .",
    "two gluons or two gluinos can exchange a gluon , but the basic gluon - gluino interaction is a gluino exchange .",
    "so the choice ( [ color_scaling ] ) for the color factor is questionable for this particular interaction . to correct",
