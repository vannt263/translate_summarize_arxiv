    "the non - commutative deformations of an object , although are not rigorously defined at the moment , exist from a more philosophical point of view .",

    "it is supposed that in a smooth point , the algebra @xmath4 of functions on @xmath2 is a free associative algebra , and the imbedding @xmath5 gives the corresponding map of algebras @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the commutative algebra of functions on @xmath3 .",

    "the deformations of an object are described by a dg lie algebra @xmath10 of derivations of an appropriate resolution of the object . on the other hand , this",

    "very informally , we can say that the dg lie algebra @xmath10 is the quillen dual to the commutative algebra @xmath7 ( in reality , it is not true , it is true only for @xmath12 ) . keeping this point of view ,",
    "it is natural to describe the non - commutative deformations by an object quillen dual to @xmath4 .",
    "the quillen duality maps dg commutative algebras to dg lie algebras and vise versa , and it maps associative dg algebras to itself ( this duality is also known as the koszul duality for operads ) .",

    "then , applying the quillen construction again , we obtain an associative dg algebra which 0th cohomology is isomorphic to the initial algebra @xmath7 .    on the other hand , the deformation dg lie algebra @xmath10 can be constructed differently from the operadic point of view .",
    "the well - known example is the deformation theory of associative algebras .",
    "the associative algebras itself can be described as algebras over an operad @xmath15 .",
    "then there is a geometric construction of a free minimal resolution of the operad @xmath15 .",
    "namely , denote by @xmath16 the @xmath17-th stasheff associahedron ( of dimension @xmath18 ) .",
    "then this minimal model @xmath19 is the direct sum @xmath20 with the chain differential where @xmath21 denotes the chain complex with the stasheff cell decomposition . by definition ,",
    "an @xmath22 algebra is an algebra over this free operad . in other words , for a vector space @xmath23 , a map of operads @xmath24 is the same that an @xmath22 algebra structure on @xmath23 .",
    "consider the tangent space to the space of these maps at some point , denote this tangent space by @xmath25 .",
    "then we can construct from the differential @xmath26 in @xmath19 an odd vector field on the space @xmath27 $ ] as we explain in section 3 .",
    "in this case of associative algebras , this construction gives exactly the hochschild complex with the gerstenhaber bracket .",
    "this is the alternative construction of the deformation lie ( in general , @xmath1 ) algebra .",
    "the initial problem from which this paper was grown , is the deformation theory ( in the classical , commutative sense ) of the ( co)associative bialgebras .",
    "we tried to construct an @xmath1 algebra governing the deformations of an ( co)associative bialgebra .",
    "we supposed that the underlying complex of this @xmath1 algebra is quasi - isomorphic to the gerstenhaber - schack complex of the ( co)associative bialgebra .",
    "we had in mind the operadic construction with the stasheff associahedrons described above .",
    "then we constructed a compactification of some spaces @xmath28 introduced by maxim kontsevich .",
    "it turned out that the boundary strata of this , a very natural , compatification , are the products of not only the spaces @xmath29 , but some spaces with multiindices @xmath30 generalizing the space @xmath28 .",
    "then it turned out that the algebraic operations under these spaces form not a prop as was expected but a new algebraic concept called here a croc .",
    "we construct a croc @xmath31 for a vector space @xmath23 .",
    "then we have a construction which is a direct generalization of the construction with the minimal model @xmath19 in the stasheff case , but here this construction gives us an _ associative dg algebra _ , not a lie dg algebra .",
    "then we interpret this associative algebra as the associative algebra governing the _ non - commutative _ deformations of the initial bialgebra .",
    "in the same way we formulate a concept of a non - commutative homotopical bialgebra .",
    "we have analogs of all these constructions in the well - understood case of associative algebras . in this case",
    ", we also construct an associative algebra governing the non - commutative deformations . according to the quillen duality philosophy",
    ", we should have `` a map '' @xmath32),\\delta)$ ] where the latter is the associative algebra we constructed , and @xmath10 is the hochschild complex with the gerstenhaber bracket .",
    "we construct such a map explicitly .",
    "it happens , however , that in the case of ( co)associative bialgebras we _ can not _ construct such a map .",

    "it is a dg commutative algebra , conjecturaly the algebra of functions on the extended commutative moduli space in the formal neighborhood of the point corresponding to the initial bialgebra .",
