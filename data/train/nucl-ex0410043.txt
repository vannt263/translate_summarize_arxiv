    "the interest to the @xmath5 reaction at relativistic energies is mostly due to the possibility to observe the manifestation of the non - nucleonic degrees of freedom and relativistic effects in the simplest bounded system .",
    "large amount of the polarization data in deuteron breakup obtained at a zero degree last years can be interpreted from the point of view @xmath6 configurations in the deuteron , where relativistic effects are taken into account by the minimal relativization scheme with the dependence of the deuteron structure on single variable @xmath7 .",
    "in addition the considering of multiple scattering is required to obtain the agreement with the data@xcite .    on the other hand , it was shown that @xmath8 data for the pion - free deuteron breakup process @xmath9 in the kinematical region close to that of backward elastic @xmath10 scattering depended on the incident deuteron momentum in addition to @xmath7@xcite .",
    "the recent measurements of the tensor analyzing power @xmath0 of deuteron inclusive breakup on nuclear targets @xcite have demonstrated a significant dependence on the transverse secondary proton momentum @xmath11 being plotted at a fixed value of the longitudinal proton momentum .",
    "this forces one to suggest that description of this quantity requires an additional independent variable , aside from @xmath7 .    in this report",
    "the angular dependence of @xmath0 in deuteron inclusive breakup on hydrogen and carbon at 9 gev / c are presented .",
    "the results are compared with the relativistic calculations using paris , cd - bonn and karmanov s deuteron wave functions ( dwfs ) .",
    "the experiment has been performed using a tensorially polarized deuteron beam of the dubna synchrophasotron and the sphere setup described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the tensor polarization of the beam has been measured from the asymmetry of protons  from the   deuteron   breakup  on nuclear   targets , @xmath12 , at a zero angle and the momenta @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the vector polarization of the beam has been measured from the asymmetry of quasi - elastic @xmath14 scattering on @xmath15 target @xcite .",
    "the tensor and vector polarizations , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , were @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "a slowly extracted deuteron beam with a typical intensity of @xmath22 @xmath23/spill was directed onto a liquid hydrogen target of 30 cm length or onto carbon targets with varied length .",
    "the data at 9 gev / c of the deuteron initial momentum were obtained at secondary proton emission angles of 85 , 130 and 160 mr and proton momenta between 4.5 and 7.0 gev / c on hydrogen and carbon .",
    "the separation of the protons and inelastically scattered deuterons was done by the measurements of their time - of - flight ( tof ) over a base line of @xmath24 m. the residual background was completely eliminated by the requirement that particles are detected at least in two prompt tof windows .",
    "the results on @xmath0 versus the momentum of the secondary protons are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] by the solid and open symbols for carbon and hydrogen targets , respectively .",
    "the circles are the data of this experiment , while the triangles represent the data obtained earlier@xcite .",
    "the dashed , dash - dotted and solid lines are the relativistic calculations using paris@xcite , cd - bonn@xcite and karmanov@xcite dwfs .              the calculations performed in the framework of the light - front dynamics @xcite with the use of paris and cd - bonn dwfs fail to reproduce the @xmath0 data , while the use of karmanov dwf depending on two internal variables , @xmath7 and @xmath1 , is in a reasonable agreement with the data obtained at 85 mr .",
    "@xmath0 data obtained at fixed proton momenta of 6.0 , 6.5 and 7.0  gev / c are plotted versus transverse proton momenta @xmath1 .",
    "the symbols and curves are the same as in fig.[fig1 ] . again",
    "the use of dwf depending on two variables@xcite gives better agreement with the data ."
