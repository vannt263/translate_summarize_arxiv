    "as is well known the coupling of the electromagnetic field to a given external field via the chern - simons term @xmath0 in the lagrangian density will give rise to the rotation of linear polarization of the photons as they propagate in the background spacetime in which @xmath1 does not vanish @xcite . here",
    "@xmath2 is the electromagnetic vector field , the antisymmetric tensor of the electromagnetic field is @xmath3 and @xmath4 is its dual .",
    "such a rotation is independent of the frequencies , different from the faraday rotation experienced by the electromagnetic waves when they pass through a magnetic field .",
    "this phenomenon may be observable on large scales , for instances on astrophysical or cosmological scales a tiny coupling might induce a significant rotation angle potentially be observable by the current or near future experiments .",
    "the chern - simons coupling violates lorentz and cpt symmetries in the background , but the gauge symmetry is preserved in cases when @xmath1 is constant or a derivative of a scalar field , i.e. , @xmath5 . in cosmology such a rotation will change the angular spectra of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) , especially rotate partially the @xmath6 mode polarization into the @xmath7 mode one @xcite .",
    "since both @xmath6 and @xmath7 modes are changed , we can use the high quality cmb observational data to detect the rotation angle even though no explicit @xmath7 mode signal has been detected .",
    "this opened a new window to test the fundamental symmetries by the cosmological probe and since the first work @xcite it has stimulated many research interests in this field @xcite .",
    "currently the contraint on the homogeneous rotation angle from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) 9-year data is @xmath8 degree @xcite .",
    "if the external field @xmath1 is a constant vector , there will be inconsistencies between the electromagnetic and gravitational field equations if the law of gravity is governed by einstein s general relativity or its covariant extensions @xcite .",
    "alternatively the external field may be originated from derivatives of some scalar fields , e.g. , @xmath9 with @xmath10 a certain mass scale which indicates the cutoff energy scale of the effective theory and @xmath11 the dimensionless coupling constant .",
    "it is present in models where the scalar field @xmath12 is a pseudo goldstone boson produced by @xmath13 symmetry breaking . like axion",
    ", this scalar field has the shift symmetry and only couples to other matter derivatively .",
    "it is expected to interact with the electromagnetic field naturally via the chern - simons term .",
    "the field @xmath12 may take the role of dark energy @xcite or not @xcite .",
    "it was also motivated by the leptogenesis models @xcite in which the baryon number asymmetry is produced in thermal equilibrium @xcite , this violates one of the sakharov s conditions @xcite obeyed in traditional baryogenesis models because @xmath14 symmetry is violated by the evolution of @xmath12 along the time direction @xcite . in this case",
    "all the equations are consistent , but the rotation angle which depends on the scalar field is not homogeneous across the sky because the scalar field , as a dynamical component , has different values at different positions . the fluctuations , treated as small effects , will bring new distortions to the cmb spectra @xcite very similar to the effects of weak lensing on cmb @xcite . measuring",
    "the direction dependence of the rotation angle with the cmb data is important to investigate the dynamics of the new scalar field @xmath12 . up to now the cmb constraint on the power spectrum of the rotation angle from wmap",
    "7-year data was put in ref.@xcite based on the formalism developed in refs .",
    "they obtained the result that for the multipoles from @xmath15 to @xmath16 , there is no evidence of non - zero power spectrum for the rotation angle within @xmath17 .    in this paper",
    "we revisit this problem and compute the new constraints on the anisotropic rotation by analyzing the recently released wmap 9-year data combined with data from the ground based cmb experiments quad and bicep .",
    "we will not adopt any model for the scalar field .",
    "we find that the dominant effect on the cmb spetra of the anisotropic rotation angle is through the suppression factors of its variance so the current data put a strong constraint on the variance as well as isotropic part of the rotation angle . in comparison ,",
    "current observational data are not sensitive to the detailed shape of the power spectrum of the rotation angle .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the relevant formalism for computing the rotated power spectra of cmb . in sec .",
    "iii , we present our result of the constraint on the homogeneous and anisotropic rotation angle from current observational data . sec .",
    "iv is the conclusion .",
    "the full lagrangian density of the maxwell theory modified by the chern - simons term ( without other sources ) is [ lagrangian ] = -14f_f^+ p_a_^  .",
    "this lagrangian density is not gauge - invariant , but the action integral @xmath18 is gauge - independent because in this paper we only consider @xmath9 and it is easy to see that after integral by part the chern - simons term can be rewritten as @xmath19 .    when applying the modified theory to cmb , the chern - simons term is expected to be significant only in the era after recombination . before that , cmb photons coupled tightly to the electrons and the chern - simons coupling is negligible compared with the dominated compton scattering .",
    "after the last scattering off the electrons , the polarization direction of the photon rotated by an angle @xcite = -^0_lssp_dx^()=  , where the integral along the light path ( parameterized by @xmath20 ) is from the light source to the point of observation . for cmb",
    ", the light source is located at the last scattering surface and one can see that the rotation angle only relies on the total difference of the field between the source and the observation point , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 represents the position on the last scattering surface and @xmath23 is the conformal time .",
    "the observation point is fixed but on the last scattering surface the scalar field @xmath12 varies with the positions . in the spatially flat universe @xmath24",
    ", the rotation angle relies on the direction @xmath25 through the dependence of the field on the position .",
    "accordingly the stokes parameters of linear polarization got a rotation [ ro ] ( i)=(qiu )  , where we have used tilde to denote the rotated parameter .",
    "more details can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    on the full sky",
    "the temperature and polarization fields can be decomposed in terms of appropriate spin - weighted harmonic functions @xcite : t()&= & _ lma_t , lmy_lm ( ) + ( qiu ) ( ) & = & _ lm a_2 , lm _ 2y_lm ( )  .",
    "the expressions for the expansion coefficients are @xmath26 instead of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , it is more convenient to use their linear combinations @xmath29 the advantage of @xmath30 decomposition is that it is coordinate - independent and the @xmath6 and @xmath7 modes represent polarization patterns of opposite parity .",
    "the power spectra are defined as a_x,l^m^^ * a_x , lm= c^xx_l _ l^l _ m^m with the assumption of statistical isotropy . in the equation above ,",
    "@xmath31 and @xmath32 denote the temperature @xmath33 and the @xmath6 and @xmath7 modes of the polarization field , respectively . for gaussian theories ,",
    "the statistical properties of the cmb temperature / polarization maps are specified fully by these six spectra . without the rotation induced by the chern - simons coupling , @xmath34 .",
    "the chern - simons term has no effect on the temperature field .",
    "the rotated polarization field ( [ ro ] ) can be decomposed in the same way except the coefficients and the spectra should be denoted by tildes .",
    "we assume the field @xmath12 which induces the rotation is also a gaussian random variable , as we have done for studies of cosmic scalar fields in other cases .",
    "so we also have a power spectrum for the rotation angle . as usual , we separate the rotation angle into its background and fluctuation , ( ) = |+ ( )  , the background part @xmath35 is homogeneous across the sky and the perturbation @xmath36 as a scalar with zero mean can be decomposed by the spherical harmonics , ( ) = _ lmb_lmy_lm ( )  . with assumed statistical isotropy of @xmath37 , the angular power spectrum of the rotation angle",

    "( [ spectra1 ] ) and ( [ powerspectra ] ) by treating @xmath35 as a free parameter and @xmath54 as a positive otherwise undetermined function of @xmath61 , and then perform a global fit to the cmb data .",
    "this method is different from that developed in @xcite , which adopted a quadratic estimator to constrain the anisotropic rotation angle .",
    "the main difference is that in our method we treat the rotation angle as a gaussian random field , its statistics is isotropic , so that the rotated polarizations of cmb which were identified as the observables are also statistically isotropic and there will be no off - diagonal correlations between different multipoles @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "however , the quadratic estimator method considers the ensemble of cmb rotated by a fixed rotation angle @xmath63 which is not averaged and breaks the statistical isotropy of the rotated polarization field of cmb .",
    "hence the off - diagonal modes of the cmb correlations do not vanish and depend explicitly on the rotation angle @xmath63 , since the averaging is done only on the cmb ensemble .",
    "especially , in the quadratic estimator method , some of the cmb correlations contain @xmath64 terms , based on which the quadratic estimator is constructed .",
    "different from this , in our method both the unrotated cmb field and the rotation field are considered as gaussian random fields and have isotropic statistics .",
    "the averaging are done on both the cmb and rotation field ensembles , only the diagonal terms are nonzero and the results do not depend on @xmath51 in the coordinate space , but rather on its auto - correlation functions ( or its power spectrum @xmath54 ) .",
    "this point can be understood in detail by comparing the cmb @xmath49 correlation appearing in @xcite ( equation ( 9 ) ) and that in our paper .",
    "the cmb @xmath49 correlation in @xcite has off - diagonal modes , and its first term is @xmath65 , while the second term is @xmath64 . in our paper , the cmb @xmath49 correlation only has diagonal @xmath57 modes and only @xmath65 and @xmath66 terms appear in @xmath57 ( the @xmath65 term is the same as that in @xcite if @xmath35 is replaced by @xmath67 ) .",
    "so in our analysis it is necessary to model the shape of @xmath54 , in the quadratic estimator method it does not need to do so .    in our computations , besides the wmap 9yr temperature and polarization data @xcite ( including the low-@xmath61 tb , low-@xmath61 eb and high-@xmath61 tb data ) , we also adopt the quad data @xcite and the bicep data @xcite . as for the cosmological model , we use a flat @xmath68 universe with a cosmological constant .",
    "the free cosmological parameters are @xmath69 , where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the baryon density and cold dark matter density respectively , @xmath72 is the ratio of the sound horizon to the angular diameter distance at decoupling , @xmath73 is the optical depth to reionization , @xmath74 is scalar spectral index , @xmath75 is the tensor to scalar ratio of the primordial spectrum and @xmath76 defines the amplitude of the primordial scalar spectrum .",
    "compared with the choice for the cosmological parameters , it is difficult to choose the parameters for the anisotropic rotation angle . from eqs .",
    "( [ spectra1 ] , [ powerspectra ] , [ decomposition ] , [ decomposition1 ] , [ decomposition2 ] ) we note that the distortions to the cmb power spectra brought by the anisotropies of the rotation angle can be divided into two parts . the first part appears in @xmath77 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , in which the anisotropies of the rotation angle suppress the cmb angular power spectra through the variance @xmath60 via the factors @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the second one is @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , which depends on the detailed shape of @xmath54 . generally speaking ,",
    "the first one dominates the cmb power spectra distortions .",
    "therefore , the data will give a strong constraint on @xmath60 but a weak constraint on the shape of @xmath54 .",
    "furthermore , the constraint on @xmath83 coming directly from the @xmath84 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 terms is larger than that coming directly from the @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 terms . due to this",
    ", it is difficult to obtain a precise constraint on the shape of @xmath54 .",
    "we can only get a loose constraint on it .",
    "the method we adopted is to let @xmath60 runs freely with @xmath54 .",
    "more specifically , we adopt six binned @xmath54 parameters @xmath85 , which are the average values of @xmath54 in the multipole regions @xmath86 , [ 101,200],[201,300],[301,400],[401,500],[501,l_{max}]$ ] respectively ( @xmath87 is the largest multipole of @xmath54 we used ) , to model the shape of @xmath54 .",
    "so in this case , the general parameter space is p = \\ { _ b , _ c , _ s , , n_s , r , a_s , | , c^(0 ) , |c^_l,1 , |c^_l,2 ,    calculate six derived parameters @xmath88 where @xmath89 , which can be used to compare @xmath60 with @xmath90 .",
    "when running the program , we set a physical prior on @xmath60 and @xmath91 , that is @xmath92 and @xmath93 , but we do not require @xmath94 .",
    "the constraints on these parameters are illuminated in figure [ p_chib2 ] , from which no positive signal of nonzero cmb polarization rotation or possible anisotropies are found , but a strong constraint is obtained .",
    "more specifically , at 2@xmath95 level of confidence , the constraints are @xmath96 ( throughout this section , radian is adopted as the unit of the angle ) , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 respectively .",
    "compared with the results presented in @xcite , it seems that the constraint obtained here is tighter .",
    "however , it is difficult to directly compare them with each other , since the two methods differ in several aspects .",
    "first , as we mentioned at the beginning of this section , we treated the anisotropic rotation angle as a gaussian random field with isotropic statistics and use the rotated power spectra to constrain its anisotropies , while in @xcite the authors adopted the quadratic maps to estimate the fixed anisotropic rotation angle .",
    "second , we set a positive prior on the @xmath60 and @xmath54 .",
    "third , the bin size we adopted is @xmath110 , which is different from @xmath111 used in @xcite .    at the same time",
    ", one can see that the constraint on @xmath60 is much stronger than @xmath112 , which indicates that the distortion of the cmb power spectra induced by the anisotropies of the rotation angle is indeed dominated by the variance @xmath60 which appears as suppression factors in @xmath77 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "due to this , we consider another simpler way , in which the effects of @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 are ignored and the parameter space becomes p=\\ { _ b , _ c , _ s , , n_s , r , a_s , |,c^(0 ) } .",
    "the results are displayed in figure [ p_chic ] and the 2@xmath95 constraints are @xmath113 , @xmath114 .",
    "the constraints are similar to that obtained with the first way , but the constraint on @xmath35 becomes weaker and the constraint on @xmath60 becomes stronger .    , the variance of the anisotropies of the rotation angle @xmath60 , binned @xmath54 parameters @xmath91 and derived parameters @xmath115 . in obtaining this result",

    ", we obtain the following conclusions about the results : ( 1 ) currently the data put strong constraints on isotropic rotation angle @xmath35 as well as the variance of the anisotropic rotation angle @xmath60",
    ". we can conclude conservatively that @xmath97 ; ( 2 ) although a precise constraint on the shape of @xmath54 is not obtained , one can still give some weak constraints on it .",
    "detecting the rotation of the cmb polarization induced by the chern - simons coupling is now considered as an important way to test lorentz and cpt symmetries in the community .",
    "usually people only focus on the isotropic rotation .",
    "theoretically if the rotation is induced by a fixed vector , when including the gravity , the equations of motions are not consistent .",
    "alternatively if it is induced by the scalar field coupling , the rotation angle must be direction dependent and we should include the anisotropy of the rotation angle in the more consistent analysis .",
    "furthermore , measuring the anisotropy of the rotation angle is equivalent to determine the distribution of the scalar field on the last scattering surface and this is very important for us to probe the detailed dynamics of the scalar field . in this paper , in a model independent way , we studied the constraints on the anisotropic rotation angle by analyzing the recently released wmap 9-year data and the data from quad and bicep experiments .",
    "we found that even though current experiments have little to say about the shape of the power spectrum of the rotation angle , but they put strong constraint on its variance and its mean value ( the homogeneous part of the rotation angle ) .",
    "our result showed no significant evidence for a nonzero rotation angle .",
