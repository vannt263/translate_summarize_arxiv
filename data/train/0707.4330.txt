    "a lack of cold gas in the central parts of rich galaxy clusters , as revealed by high - resolution x - ray observations , has posed a `` cooling flow '' problem , requiring sources of heat to balance radiative cooling of an intracluster medium ( icm ) . among the proposed heating mechanisms ( see @xcite for review ) , energy injection from active galactic nuclei appears to be the most favorable , although it requires a central black hole to be more massive than observed @xcite and is unable to maintain a long term energy balance if jets are narrow @xcite .",
    "diffusive heating via thermal conduction and/or turbulent mixing may also be effective if the relevant diffusion coefficient is quite large and fine tuned ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "less well recognized is the icm heating by cluster galaxies that possess a lot of available energy in their motions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "* hereafter bs ) showed that resonant excitations of internal waves driven by orbiting galaxies produce heat at cluster centers comparable to radiative loss , provided the galaxy mass is large enough .",
    "using monte - carlo approaches , @xcite showed that dynamical friction of galaxies can be a distributed source of heat if the mass - to - light ratio of galaxies exceeds 10 .",
    "@xcite found that heating by dynamical friction reduces the growth rates of thermal instability .",
    "all these works suggest that the effects of galaxy motions on thermodynamic evolution of icm are by no means negligible .",
    "most of the studies cited above are based on the assumption that the energy lost by galaxies is all transferred to _",
    "thermal _ energy of the icm _ locally _ near the galaxies .",
    "this is apparently not the case because galaxy wakes are spatially extended , overlap with each other , and induce kinetic as well as thermal energies @xcite .",
    "the possibility of the icm stirring by galaxy motions is interesting because turbulence appears to be pervasive in the icm ( e.g. , @xcite ) and perhaps determines the characteristic strengths and scales of cluster magnetic fields ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although bs allowed for the spatial propagation of internal waves , they focused on linear gaseous responses in the wkb limit .",
    "* hereafter lbh ) explored nonlinear evolution of gravity waves , but their models considered a single galaxy on a radial orbit . in this letter , we extend lhb by considering a number of cluster galaxies on isotropic orbits . by varying the mass and number of galaxies ,",
    "we quantify the thermal and kinetic energies induced by galaxy motions and explore the level and shape of such driven icm turbulence .",
    "we consider a galaxy cluster in which the icm is initially in hydrostatic equilibrium under a dark matter potential @xmath9 .",
    "for the initial temperature of the icm , we adopt a simple form @xmath10 $ ] kev with the cooling radius @xmath11 kpc .",
    "we represent a rigid dark halo using an nfw profile with the characteristic mass @xmath12 and scale radius @xmath13 kpc @xcite .",
    "although we do not allow for the presence of a central dominant galaxy considered in lbh , the cooling core inside @xmath14 in our model still satisfies the condition for resonant excitation of gravity waves ( see  [ reso ] ) .",
    "to study the responses of the icm to member galaxies , we solve the ideal hydrodynamic equations : @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the time - varying gravitational potential due to the galaxies and @xmath19 is the volumetric cooling rate .",
    "the other symbols have their usual meanings .",
    "the effects of gaseous self - gravity and magnetic fields are ignored .",
    "we adopt an ideal gas law @xmath20 with @xmath21 .",
    "we run both adiabatic ( with @xmath22 ) and cooling ( with @xmath23 ) models by taking the cooling function @xmath19 used in @xcite .",
    "we consider a total of @xmath0 member galaxies distributed within 1 mpc .",
    "we assume that they follow isotropic and isothermal orbits with velocity dispersion @xmath24 km s@xmath25 , in which case the equilibrium galaxy number density is @xmath26 , where @xmath27 @xcite . under this distribution , about 13% of the galaxies",
    "are located within @xmath14 at any given time .",
    "we ignore back reaction of the icm to the galaxies since the energy lost due to dynamical friction is small ( lbh ) .",
    "we represent each galaxy using a plummer potential @xmath28 with mass @xmath29 and scale radius @xmath30 kpc ; the total perturbing potential is constructed as @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the position vector of the @xmath33-th galaxy at time @xmath34 .",
    "to simulate diverse cluster conditions , we vary the number and mass of the galaxies in the ranges of @xmath35 and @xmath36 . we report in this work the results only for models where all the galaxies have equal masses @xcite , we have confirmed that results are almost unchanged if the breaking mass @xmath37 in the mass distribution is equal to @xmath29 in the corresponding fixed mass case . ] .",
    "we follow the nonlinear evolution of the hot icm using a modified version of the zeus code @xcite , parallelized on a distributed - memory platform .",
    "our simulation domain is a cubic box with each side of 2 mpc ; the center of the box is located at the cluster center .",
    "we construct a logarithmically spaced cartesian grid with 256@xmath38 zones , with outflow conditions at all boundaries zones , and checked that the results are within less than 10% of those from 256@xmath38 runs .",
    "this suggests the energy dissipation caused by numerical diffusion is tolerable .",
    "see  [ heat ] . ] .",
    "the grid spacing is 0.3 , 4 , and 33 kpc at the center , the cooling radius , and the edge of the box , respectively .",
    "we have confirmed the accuracy of the code by comparing the test results for wakes produced by linear - trajectory perturbers with the analytic formula of @xcite .",
    "we first explore the responses of the adiabatic gas to a single galaxy moving either on a radial or a circular trajectory .",
    "bs showed that gravity waves excited by a galaxy with orbital frequency @xmath39 become trapped and amplify in the region where the local brunt - visl frequency @xmath40 exceeds @xmath39 .",
    "this finding was subsequently confirmed by lbh who ran numerical simulations for a radial - orbit galaxy .",
    "our aim here is to find the dependency of energy injection rate on the galaxy mass as well as on the shape of its orbit .",
    "figure [ fig_lbh]a shows the radial distributions of the radial orbit , circular orbit , and brunt - visl frequencies in our icm model . even without a central massive galaxy",
    ", @xmath40 remains almost flat inside @xmath41 kpc , allowing resonant excitation of gravity waves there . for models with a radial orbit ,",
    "the galaxy initially set to move with velocity @xmath42 from the origin has an average speed of @xmath43 until it reaches a turning point at @xmath44 ( black dot in fig .",
    "[ fig_lbh]a ) . for circular - orbit models ,",
    "the orbital speed is @xmath45 at @xmath46 kpc ( blue dot ) . in both cases ,",
    "the orbital period of the galaxy is @xmath47 , which is chosen to ensure @xmath48 inside @xmath14 .",
    "as the galaxy starts to move , it generates density and velocity perturbations , forming a gravitational wake and imparting some of its gravitational energy to thermal and kinetic energies of the icm . in general",
    ", the perturbations are a superposition of @xmath49- and @xmath50-waves . while high - frequency @xmath49-waves propagate",
    "out through a stratified background , outgoing @xmath50-waves reflected at , and remain trapped within , the resonance radius ( @xmath51 in our models ) .",
    "the gas near the center receives periodic kicks from the galaxy , enhancing the levels of density and velocity fluctuations .",
    "overall evolution of the models with a galaxy on the radial orbit is similar to that presented in lbh .",
    "figure [ fig_lbh]b shows a snapshot of the perturbed density in the orbital plane at @xmath52 for a model where a galaxy with mass @xmath53 orbits circularly at a near transonic speed ( mach number = 0.97 ) in the clockwise direction .",
    "it is apparent that perturbations periodically provided by the orbiting galaxy is focused to the central part .",
    "the associated vorticity is also well contained inside the resonance marked by a dotted circle , indicative of resonant excitation ( lhb ) .",
    "the density perturbations near the galaxy in a weak trailing shape are a characteristic feature of a wake for a circular - orbit perturber @xcite .",
    "as the galaxy orbits the cluster center and resonantly interacts with the background gas , the kinetic energy absorbed in the icm secularly increases ( approximately linearly ) with time , while showing some temporal fluctuations .",
    "we run a number of models with varying @xmath29 , and measure the rate @xmath54 at which kinetic energy increases inside @xmath14 .",
    "figure [ fig_lbh]c plots the resulting @xmath54 , which are fairly well fitted by @xmath55 and @xmath56 for the radial- and circular - orbit cases , respectively . for the model parameters we adopt , therefore , a galaxy on a radial orbit is about three times more efficient in driving kinetic energy into the icm than the circular - orbit counterpart , since it in the former orbit can traverse the central region directly ( bs ) .",
    "the dependency of @xmath54 on @xmath57 indicates that perturbations in all the models with a single galaxy are in the linear regime .",
    "we now consider more realistic cluster models in which the icm is continuously stirred by many member galaxies .",
    "we run nine adiabatic models as well as nine cooling counterparts .",
    "figure [ fig_ekdot ] plots time evolution of the kinetic energy @xmath58 of the icm inside @xmath14 for some of the adiabatic models .",
    "a sudden introduction of the galaxies causes the icm to respond abruptly , initiating an rapid increase of @xmath58 for @xmath59 . for models",
    "d ( @xmath60 , @xmath61 ) and e ( @xmath60 , @xmath62 ) , the perturbations are initially in the linear regime and soon begin to interact resonantly with the background gas .",
    "as gravity waves concentrate toward the center and amplify , @xmath58 grows secularly with time . for @xmath63 , @xmath58 in models d and e ( and other models with @xmath1 ) increases almost linearly at a rate @xmath64 .",
    "compared to the results of  [ reso ] , this corresponds to about 20 radial - orbit galaxies taking part in resonant excitation of the icm inside @xmath14 . on the other hand , in model a ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) where initial perturbations are very strong",
    ", @xmath58 stays almost constant at @xmath67 during its entire evolution , indicating weak or no resonant excitation .",
    "models b ( @xmath68 ) and c ( @xmath69 ) that have weaker initial perturbations than model a enhance @xmath58 to the saturation level @xmath70 for @xmath71 , after which @xmath58 again remains constant . at saturation ,",
    "the amplitudes of density fluctuations are about 40% relative to the mean value , easily disrupting galaxy wakes that would otherwise supply fresh perturbations for resonant excitation .",
    "consequently , resonant excitation becomes weak or even absent in a highly nonlinear background .",
    "unlike kinetic energy that grows with time when @xmath72 is sufficiently small , we find that thermal energy of the icm does not show a clear indication of resonant excitation .",
    "the total amount of thermal energy within @xmath14 driven by a mere introduction of the galaxies is @xmath73 , which is already large and stays more or less constant with time for all the models .",
    "this may be because kinetic energy is more prone to resonant excitation , or because the amount of heat supplied ( presumably at a rate similar to @xmath54 ) by resonant excitation is much smaller than @xmath74 , so that it does not readily manifest in the energy curves over time .",
    "the ratio of kinetic to thermal energies in a wake produced by a single galaxy with size @xmath75 and velocity @xmath76 is roughly @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the adiabatic sound speed of the icm @xcite .",
    "since this ratio is less than @xmath79 when @xmath80 for typical parameters we adopt , kinetic energy is certainly a much better tracer of resonant excitation .    to check if galaxy motions and the associated heating can solve the cooling flow problem , we repeat the simulations by including the radiative cooling explicitly .",
    "our models lose thermal energy at a rate @xmath81 from the cooling core . without any heat source , they would experience a cooling catastrophe within @xmath82 .",
    "it turned out that none of the models we considered were able to prevent , albeit considerably delay , the runaway cooling .",
    "for instance , the cooling model with @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( corresponding to model d ) undergoes a catastrophic event at @xmath83 , while the model @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( corresponding to model a ) develops a cooling flow in @xmath84 near the center",
    ". the heating rate due to resonant excitation is probably lower in the latter model , for which the perturbed kinetic energy saturates immediately .",
    "we have seen that motions of the member galaxies generate a large amount of kinetic energy in the icm .",
    "the kinetic energy is in the form of fluctuating isotropic velocity fields with vanishingly small mean values .",
    "we regard these spatially - uncorrelated , random gas motions as icm turbulence . to quantify the turbulence level , for each run we measure the velocity dispersions of the gas inside @xmath14 .",
    "figure [ fig_turb]a plots as open circles the resulting density - weighted 3d velocity dispersion @xmath85 averaged over @xmath86 as a function of @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the icm mass inside @xmath14 . filled circles give non - weighed velocity dispersions , which is larger than the density - weighted values by about a factor of 1.5 .",
    "consistent with the results of the previous subsection , @xmath76 increases linearly with @xmath89 until @xmath90 , beyond which @xmath76 is approximately constant at @xmath91 .    to characterize the turbulence driven by galaxy motions ,",
    "we calculate fourier power spectra of the compressive and shear components of icm velocities defined by @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "here , @xmath94 is the fourier transformed velocity and @xmath95 is the wavenumber .",
    "we then bin them spherically in the @xmath95-space and calculate the angle - averaged power spectra @xmath96 and @xmath97 as functions of the radial wavenumber @xmath98 .",
    "figure [ fig_turb]b shows @xmath99 and @xmath100 for models c and e at @xmath52 .",
    "the ratio of total power in the compressive to shearing parts is about 2.5 for both models , indicative of fairly subsonic turbulence ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the power index of the shearing part is @xmath7 in the inertial range for model e , which becomes steeper with increasing @xmath76 , yielding @xmath8 for model c. the compressive parts have similar slopes , although they have excess power at @xmath101 kpc scales , which appear to be associated with the mean galaxy separations .",
    "galaxies in a cluster contain a plentiful amount of energy in their orbital motions that can be transferred to turbulent kinetic and thermal energies of the icm ( e.g. , bs ; @xcite ) . in this letter",
    ", we have shown that resonant excitation of gravity waves driven by galaxy motions is efficient only when density and velocity fluctuations in the background are in the linear regime , while becoming inefficient when the background medium exhibits large amplitude fluctuations .",
    "although it is uncertain at what rate resonant excitation heats the icm , our numerical results suggest that heating by galaxy motions is insufficient to quench the cooling catastrophe .",
    "if the heating rate is similar to the kinetic energy injection rate @xmath54 we found , the energy balance between the heating and x - ray cooling requires @xmath102 .",
    "although rich clusters may contain enough number and mass of galaxies to satisfy this condition , resonant excitation will switch off when this condition is met .",
    "we thus conclude that heating by galaxy motions _ alone _ can not be the main solution to the cooling flow problem , although it can delay the catastrophic event significantly ( e.g. , bs ; @xcite ) .",
    "the two key parameters that control the rate of energy injection and the level of turbulence are the mass and number of galaxies .",
    "many uncertainties surround the observational determinations of the average galaxy mass , but a recent analysis using strong - lensing models shows that a cluster galaxy can have mass as large as @xmath103 including a dark halo @xcite . for rich clusters with @xmath104 inside 1 mpc , therefore , our numerical results suggest that icm turbulence driven solely by galaxy motions is probably in a saturated state with @xmath105 .",
    "given the many arbitrary choices for the cluster parameters , this value is in rough agreement with an analytic estimate of @xmath106 by @xcite who used scaling laws of hydrodynamic wakes without considering nonlinear saturation .",
    "note that the saturated @xmath76 is similar to those required to explain the observed magnetic field strength ( @xmath107 g ) in terms of energy equipartition ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the angle - averaged velocity power spectra of turbulence driven in our models are characterized by inertial - range slopes ranging from @xmath7 to @xmath8 .",
    "it is interesting to note that these are comparable to the values between @xmath108 and @xmath109 inferred from the observed pressure maps of the icm in the coma cluster @xcite , although density inhomogeneities created by recent infall / mergers ( e.g. , @xcite ) are likely to influence the pressure maps of the coma cluster that is dynamically young .",
    "obviously , there are other potential driving sources including agn and subcluster mergers , ram pressure stripping , etc",
    ". it will be interesting to see how turbulence driven by each process adds together when nonlinear effects as well as magnetic fields are considered .",
