    "mesoscopic circuits with multiterminal electron wave guides have interesting and useful physical properties .",
    "figure [ fig : setup ] shows an example of a circuit where a y - branch wave guide acts as a coherent beam splitter for electrons injected from a normal or superconducting reservoir .",
    "such a circuit with normal electron reservoirs ( nyn ) has been first suggested to test statistical properties of the fermi electrons by measuring current - current correlations in the arms of the splitter.@xcite this correlation is negative for the case of fermi statistics , which was indeed observed in the experiment.@xcite however , the correlations may change the sign and become positive ( similar to the case of bose particles ) when the electrons are injected from a superconducting reservoir ( nys).@xcite this effect is related to the cooper pairing in the superconductor .",
    "another kind of interference effect , namely a phase dependent conductance , has been predicted@xcite for a circuit geometry ( syn ) where the arms of the electron beam splitter are connected to a superconductor . in this case , the electrons undergo andreev reflection from the ns interfaces@xcite , picking up the superconducting phase at the connection points . the phase difference at the connection points",
    "is created by a supercurrent flowing along the surface of superconducting electrode , e.g. due to a presence of a magnetic field ( see fig . [",
    "fig : setup ] ) .",
    "the phase dependence of the conductance of such ns interferometers has been observed in a large number of experiments.@xcite    in this paper , we investigate the properties of current - voltage characteristics of sns interferometers , i.e. sys - circuits where the arms of the y - branch splitter and the injection lead are connected to superconducting electrodes , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "as is well known , the current between two superconductors at applied voltage @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the superconducting gap ) is governed by the mechanism of multiple andreev reflections ( mar).@xcite the fingerprint of this transport mechanism is the subharmonic gap structure ( sgs ) at @xmath4.@xcite in sns interferometers one should expect the sgs to be significantly modified and become sensitive to the superconducting phase difference ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ) .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the following qualitative argument .",
    "one may consider the interferometer as an sns junction ( @xmath5 ) which is coupled to the injection electrode @xmath6 via the y - branch wave guide .",
    "the sns junction contains bound andreev levels which are broadened due to the open connection to the injection lead .",
    "the andreev levels , the energy of which depends on the superconducting phase difference , produce resonances in the current transport between the superconducting reservoirs .",
    "these resonances will significantly modify the sgs , similar to the effect of superconducting bound states in long sns junctions.@xcite however , in the sns interferometers the resonance structures will be phase dependent.@xcite    the problem has become particularly interesting due to recent experiments on a three - terminal sns interferometer by kutchinsky et al .",
    ", @xcite in which phase dependence of the conductance structures has been observed . in this experiment ,",
    "the normal region of the interferometer was fabricated with diffusive two - dimensional metallic film .",
    "the effect will be more pronounced with a ballistic normal region , especially in the quantum transport regime , when the y - wave guide supports a small amount of conducting modes . in practice",
    ", such devices could be fabricated with etched or gated ballistic 2d electron gas in a multilayered semiconducting structure.@xcite quantum transport in ns interferometers has been investigated in refs . , and the resonance enhancement of the two - particle andreev current has been discussed . in sns interferometers",
    "the situation is more complex , since the interplay between the andreev bound states and mar will lead to resonances appearing in all multiparticle currents .",
    "the purpose of our study is to develop mar theory for sns interferometers , i.e. , to include the interference effect and the effect of andreev resonances in the mar calculation scheme@xcite and to analyze the phase dependent current - voltage characteristics ( cvc ) .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the model of the interferometer and derive equations for the mar scattering amplitudes . in section iii , we present the results of numerical calculation of the cvc of the interferometer , and in section iv , we present analytical perturbative analysis of the resonant current structures in the cvc .",
    "we consider the sns interferometer shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] , which consists of a normal - electron y - branch quantum wire , fabricated e.g. with etched or gated 2d electron gas , which is connected to two bulk superconducting electrodes .",
    "the superconducting electrode connected to the two arms of the splitter is ring shaped , so that magnetic flux can be sent through the ring to induce a superconducting phase difference @xmath7 between the connection points @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the current is sent through the interferometer by applying voltage @xmath10 between the electrode @xmath6 and the ring .",
    "our aim is to calculate the injected current as a function of the applied voltage and the phase difference , @xmath0 . to this end",
    "we shall apply the theory of coherent multiple andreev reflections ( mar ) , which is based on the calculation of scattering states created by incoming quasiparticles from the three superconducting terminals.@xcite for the sake of simplicity , we adopt a single mode description of the wires and model the splitter by a 3@xmath113 scattering matrix @xmath12 ( see eq .",

    "a coherent mar problem includes the following steps : first the recurrence for the scattering amplitudes is formulated by employing the boundary conditions at the scatterer and at the ns interfaces .",
    "then a solution for the recurrence can be constructed , from which the current is calculated . in the present case of a three - terminal junction standard mar technique can not be used directly . to solve this problem",
    "we will describe the andreev reflections from the two interfaces of the interferometer , seen by the injector @xmath6 , as a complex reflection from a single effective interface ; by doing this we reduce the 3-terminal problem to an equivalent 2-terminal problem , on which we can apply standard mar technique for a 2-terminal junctions developed in ref ..",
    "reflection from the interferometer ( left interface ) is then represented by a non - trivial transfer matrix that contains information about andreev states in the interferometer . to more",
    "clearly understand the effect of the phase difference on the injection current , we will neglect the length of the normal wires and assume all ns interfaces to be completely transparent .",

    "a similar analysis applies to the current injected from the interferometer , @xmath71 : in this case , the double resonance is formed by the andreev state at @xmath174 and the quasibound state at lower gap edge .",
    "the height of the double resonance peak is @xmath192 .",
    "a double resonance involving two andreev bound states occurs in the four - particle current injected from the right as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mar]d .",
    "the corresponding mar path is selected by the conditions @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "the resulting peak is situated at @xmath195 and has the hight @xmath196 . in the vicinity of the peak , @xmath197 , the expression for the resonant four - particle current becomes ,",
    "@xmath198 ^ 2+e_2 ^ 2{\\tilde \\gamma}_-^2 } , \\label{i4}\\ ] ] where @xmath199 the current peak under consideration is a full - scale current structure in a region of the ivc which in point contacts is dominated by non - resonant four - particle current , which is of the order @xmath200 . as any andreev resonance ,",
    "the four - particle current peak strongly depends on the phase difference ; it disappears at @xmath1 .",
    "the peak exists within the voltage interval @xmath151 and within the phase difference window @xmath201 .",
    "we note that the positions of all discussed current structures are proportional to the order parameter @xmath3 and therefore temperature dependent and scale with @xmath3 .",
    "we end this section with the discussion of cvc at large voltage , @xmath202 .",
    "the current at large voltage results exclusively from the single particle and pair currents .",
    "it is straightforward to calculate the single particle current at large voltage from eq .",
    "( [ i1appr ] ) , @xmath203 the first term in this equation is the current through the normal junction , while the second term is the single - particle contribution to the excess current , @xmath204 this excess current is large , @xmath205 , and negative , which reflects the suppression of the current onset at @xmath164 . the pair current contribution to the excess current is dominated by the resonance and is given by eq .",
    "( [ i2a ] ) .",
    "the total excess current to leading order in @xmath49 has the form @xmath206 the excess current in the interferometer is large and negative , in sharp contrast to quantum point contacts , where the excess current is small , @xmath207 , and positive.@xcite however , it turns to zero at @xmath86 , in agreement with our observation that in this case the interferometer behaves as a quantum point contact .",
    "the excess current achieves its minimum value at @xmath1 because of blockade of the pair current .",
    "we have investigated the phase dependence of the dc current - voltage characteristics ( cvc ) in sns interferometers consisting of two superconducting reservoirs connected by a y - shaped normally conducting quantum wire .",
    "we have developed a generalization of the existing coherent mar theory , which fully incorporates the effect of interference , as well as resonance effects due to andreev bound states in the interferometer .",
    "the phase dependent current - voltage characteristic @xmath0 has been numerically investigated for single - mode wires with length smaller than the superconducting coherence length . the analytical study of the current was performed using a resonance approximation in the limit of weak coupling of the interferometer to the injection lead .",
    "we found significant enhancement of the subgap current at finite phase difference compared to the case of zero phase difference .",
    "the enhancement is accompanied by a shift of the onset of the current at @xmath208 to smaller voltages , @xmath209 , and appearance of current peaks at @xmath174 and @xmath210 .",
    "these features are produced by resonant andreev reflection of the injected particles by the s@xmath211ns@xmath212 junction of the interferometer : they are most pronounced for weak coupling of the s@xmath211ns@xmath212 junction to the injection lead .",
    "the positions of all current structures are temperature dependent and scale with @xmath3 .",
    "we further found strong suppression of the current when the phase difference approaches @xmath213 : in this region all subgap current structures disappear and , moreover , the excess current at large voltage becomes negative ( deficiency current ) .",
    "the magnitude of the deficiency current is considerably large at @xmath1 .",
    "this effect results from the suppression of the andreev reflections from the s@xmath211n and s@xmath212n interfaces due to the interference in the arms of the beam splitter ( cf . a similar effect in ns interferometers@xcite ) .",
    "we conclude our discussion with some brief comments on the connection of the studied model to more realistic experimental devices based on 2d electron gas structures . in such devices ,",
    "the normal region has a typical size which exceeds the superconducting coherence length and it contains several conducting electronic modes .",
    "furthermore , the ns interfaces are not perfectly transparent .",
    "however , this effect is less important since the interface reflection coefficient in practice can be rather small ( @xmath214 ) .",
    "increasing the length of the arms of the interferometer will result in the appearance of new phase dependent current peaks due to increasing number of andreev states in the sns junction of the interferometer ( cf .",
    "ref .  ) .",
    "similarly , increasing the length of the injection lead will result in the appearance of current resonances which do not depend on the phase difference , due to @xmath7-independent superconducting bound states in this lead.@xcite in interferometers with multimode wires , the resonant current peaks will be smeared ; however , one should still expect some phase dependent resonant features similar to the case of diffusive ns interferometers @xcite .",
    "the interference effect leading to the large deficient current at large applied voltage will survive in multimode junctions .",
