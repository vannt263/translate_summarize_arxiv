    "since the discovery of the submillimeter population of galaxies ( smail , ivison , & blain 1997 ; hughes et al .  1998 ; barger et al .  1998 ; eales et al .",

    "remain about the population as a whole , foremost among these are the redshift distribution and dominant energy source heating the dust .",
    "detailed studies of individual sub - mm galaxies are crucial in answering these questions , however , progress has been slow since many sub - mm sources are extremely faint in their observed optical bands .",
    "several of the original potential bright optical counterparts are now suspected to be mis - identifications based on deep near - infrared observations ( smail et al .",

    "the molecular co line data for the sub - mm galaxies show the presence of sufficient molecular gas to fuel high levels of star - formation activity ( frayer et al .",
    "1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "however , the relative importance of agn and starburst activity in powering the high luminosities of the sub - mm population is still open to debate , as is the case with local ulirgs ( e.g. , sanders & mirabel 1996 ; genzel et al . 1998 ; veilleux , kim , & sanders 1999 ) . in order to understand the nature of the sub - mm population",
    ", we have been carrying out multi - wavelength observations of individual systems in the scuba cluster lens survey ( smail et al .",
    "this survey consists of 15 background sub - mm sources identified from sensitive sub - mm mapping of seven massive , lensing clusters .",
    "the advantage of this sample is that the amplification of the background sources allows for deeper source frame observations .    in this paper",
    "we report a redshift of @xmath8 for the sub - mm galaxy smmj04431 + 0210 ( n4 ) , obtained from near - infrared observations with the nirspec instrument on the keckii telescope .",
    "the galaxy n4 at @xmath9 , @xmath10 ( j2000 ) was previously identified as the likely sub - mm counterpart based on its extremely red i@xmath2k color ( smail et al .",
    "an increasing number of sub - mm sources are now believed to be extremely red objects ( eros [ @xmath11 ) due to their high dust content ( smail et al .",

    "since n4 is the brightest k - band ( 2.2@xmath6 m ) ero counterpart in the cluster lens survey , it is an ideal candidate for testing whether redshifts can be obtained for the scuba population in the near - infrared .",
    "in addition , n4 has a 850@xmath6 m flux density of only 1.6mjy , after correcting for lensing , making it one of the intrinsically weakest sub - mm sources yet identified",
    ". studies of weak sub - mm sources such as n4 are crucial to our understanding of the population as a whole since the majority of the sub - mm background arises from sources with s(850@xmath6m)@xmath5mjy ( blain et al .",

    ". we also report on follow - up co observations with the ovro millimeter array to search for molecular gas , as well as optical spectroscopy with the esi instrument on the keckii telescope to search for additional rest - frame optical and ultraviolet ( uv ) emission lines .",

    "n4 was observed with nirspec ( near infrared spectrograph ) on keckii on 2000 december 26 .",
    "nirspec is a spectrograph operating over 0.95 to 5.4@xmath6 m ( mclean et al .",

    "the seeing was typically 0@xmath18 during the spectroscopic observations . the 42@xmath19 length slit was placed at a position angle of @xmath20 to contain both n4 and the core of the bright nearby galaxy @xmath21 from n4 ( fig .",

    "we followed up the k - band detection of h@xmath0 by searching for the [ oiii]5007,4959 doublet and h@xmath22 line in h - band using nirspec .",
    "we used the same slit setup as done previously for k - band .",
    "the nspec6 filter was used since it is optimized on the redward side of h - band at the wavelengths of the redshifted emission lines .",
    "the nirspec data were combined in pairs at two different positions along the slit .",
    "this provided a zeroth - order background subtraction as well as removing the dark and bias levels from the data .",
    "pixel - to - pixel gain variations were removed by dividing by a normalized flat produced from halogen lamp images .",
    "the spectra were transformed to produce a linear spatial and wavelength scale using standard tasks in the iraf longslit package .",
    "observations of a star nodded along the slit provided spatial calibration , while neon and argon arc lamp lines as well as sky lines provided wavelength calibration . a linear background was subtracted from the frames as a function of wavelength to remove time variations in the sky emission .",
    "the spectra of bright calibration stars were used to correct for variations in the detector response as a function of wavelength .",
    "given its proximity , residual light from the nearby galaxy is present in the extracted spectrum of n4 after standard data reduction . in order to obtain the true continuum level and spectral slope for n4 , the wings of the galaxy light were subtracted from n4 as a function of wavelength .",
    "there is a natural trade - off between the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio of the final spectrum and the wavelength resolution over which the subtraction is done .",
    "we smoothed over two resolution elements in wavelength for the galaxy subtraction , which left a slight residual narrow paschen-@xmath0 emission line from the foreground galaxy ( @xmath23 ) at @xmath24 m .",

    "the esi data were taken in the high - resolution echelle mode which provided wavelength coverage from 3900   to 1100   at a resolution of approximately @xmath25 . a slit with a width of @xmath26",
    "the esi optical spectra were calibrated using the spectrophotometric standard feige 110 ( massey et al .  1988 ) .",

    "we observed using a random dithered pattern with about @xmath31 between adjacent dither positions .",
    "sixty second integrations were taken at each position .",
    "a total of 22 and 74minutes of on - source data were obtained in the k and j filters , respectively .",
    "the seeing - disks of the stars observed throughout the exposures varied from about @xmath32 to @xmath33 ( fwhm ) .",
    "sets of dark frames from each night were subtracted from each exposure to remove the dark current as well as the bias level .",
    "the dark - subtracted exposures were divided by a normalized skyflat .",
    "frames were sky - subtracted using temporally  adjacent images .",

    "is estimated to be better than 0.06 magnitude .",

    "the random probability of finding a bright ero similarly as red ( @xmath39 ) as n4 within the @xmath40 positional uncertainty of the scuba data is less than 0.1% , based on the observed ero surface densities for @xmath41 ( thompson et al .",
    "1999 ; smith et al .",
    "if we relax the sub - mm positional uncertainty and account for lensing , the likelihood of a chance coincidence with an ero is still less than 1% , and no other candidate red objects are nearby .",
    "the identification of n4 as the sub - mm counterpart has recently been confirmed by the detection of co emission from n4 at the h@xmath0 redshift with the iram pdb interferometer ( r. neri et al .",
    "2003 , in preparation ) .",

    "the high - level of extinction implied by the h@xmath0/h@xmath22 ratio is consistent with the non - detection of ly@xmath0 emission from the esi observations ( table 2 ) .",

    "the h@xmath0 emission is spread over 750@xmath37 ( fwzi ) , and using a radius of 1.0kpc we calculate a dynamical mass of @xmath55 , where the inclination ( @xmath56 ) is unknown",

    "therefore , the data for n4 are consistent with a narrow - line agn surrounded by an extended region of active star - formation ( baldwin , phillips , & terlevich 1981 ; veilleux & osterbrock 1987 ) or a powerful starburst with large - scale nuclear shocks driven by a nuclear superwind .",

    "the only x - ray data that currently exists for n4 are from _ rosat _ , and these data are not sensitive enough to constrain the fraction of the bolometric luminosity which may arise from an agn . given the unknown contribution from a possible agn and the uncertainty in the level of extinction , the star - formation rate ( sfr ) is fairly uncertain for n4 .",

    "future multi - wavelength observations should provide better constraints on the source of its immense luminosity .",
