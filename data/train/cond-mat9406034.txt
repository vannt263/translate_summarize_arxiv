    "reflectionless tunneling is a novel quantum interference effect which occurs when dissipative normal current is converted into dissipationless supercurrent at the interface between a normal metal ( n ) and a superconductor ( s ) @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the effect is observed as a peak in the differential conductance around zero voltage or around zero magnetic field @xcite .",
    "its name refers to the fact that , for full phase coherence , the andreev - reflected quasiparticle can tunnel through the potential barrier at the ns interface without suffering reflections .",
    "( the potential barrier can be the insulator ( i ) in an nis junction , or the schottky barrier in a semiconductor  superconductor junction . )",
    "application of a voltage or magnetic field destroys the phase coherence between electrons and holes , and thus reduces the conductance of the junction .",
    "we now have a good theoretical understanding of the effect , based on a combination of numerical @xcite , and analytical work @xcite .",
    "the basic requirement for reflectionless tunneling is that the normal region has a resistance which is larger than the resistance of the interface . in that case",
    "the disorder is able to open a fraction of the tunneling channels , _",
    "i.e. _ it induces the appearance of transmission eigenvalues close to one @xcite . as a result of these open channels ,",
    "the resistance has a linear dependence on the transparency of the interface , instead of the quadratic dependence expected for andreev reflection @xcite ( which is a two - particle process ) .",
    "the purpose of this work is to present a study of reflectionless tunneling in its simplest form , when the resistance of the normal metal is due to a second tunnel barrier , in series with the barrier at the ns interface .",
    "this allows an exact calculation , which shows many of the features of the more complicated case when the resistance of the normal region is due to disorder .",
    "furthermore , the double - barrier geometry provides an experimentally realizable model system , for example in tunneling from an stm into a superconductor via a metal particle @xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we consider the problem of a @xmath0 junction without disorder .",
    "we compute the resistance of the junction as a function of the transmission probabilities per mode @xmath6 and @xmath5 of the two barriers .",
    "the resistance at fixed @xmath5 shows a _ minimum _ as a function of @xmath6 when @xmath9 .",
    "the resistance in the minimum depends _ linearly _ on @xmath10 , in contrast to the quadratic dependence in the case of a single barrier . in section 3",
    "we apply a recent scaling theory @xcite , to find the influence on the resistance minimum of disorder in the region between the barriers ( length @xmath4 , mean free path @xmath3 ) .",
    "the resistance minimum persists as long as @xmath11 . in the diffusive regime ( @xmath12 )",
    "our results agree with a previous green s function calculation by volkov , zaitsev , and klapwijk @xcite .",
    "the analytical results are supported by numerical simulations , using the recursive green s function technique  @xcite .",
    "we conclude in section 4 .",
    "we consider a @xmath13 junction , where @xmath14 = normal metal , @xmath15 = superconductor , and @xmath16 = insulator or tunnel barrier ( see inset of fig .  1 ) . the transmission probability per mode of @xmath16 is denoted by @xmath17 .",
    "for simplicity we neglect the mode - dependence of @xmath17 . in this section ,",
    "we assume ballistic motion between the barriers .",
    "( the effect of disorder in the normal region is considered in sec .",
    "a straightforward calculation yields the transmission probabilities @xmath18 of the two barriers in series , @xmath19 where    [ eq : ab ] @xmath20    and @xmath21 is the phase accumulated between the barriers by mode @xmath22 ( with @xmath23 the number of propagating modes at the fermi level ) . if we substitute @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) , the coefficients @xmath26 and @xmath27 can be rewritten as    [ eq : abalpha ] @xmath28    since the transmission matrix @xmath29 is diagonal , the transmission probabilities @xmath18 are identical to the eigenvalues of @xmath30 .",
    "we use the general relationship between the conductance @xmath31 of the ninis junction and the transmission eigenvalues of the normal region  @xcite , @xmath32 which is the analogue of the landauer formula , @xmath33 for the conductance @xmath34 in the normal state .",
    "we assume that @xmath35 ( @xmath36 is the fermi wavelength ) and @xmath37 , so that the conductance is not dominated by a single resonance . in this case , the phases @xmath21 are distributed uniformly in the interval @xmath38 and we may replace the summations in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : carlo ] ) ,  ( [ eq : land ] ) by integrals over @xmath39 : @xmath40 .",
    "the result is @xmath41 these expressions are symmetric in the indices 1 and 2 : it does not matter which of the two barriers is closest to the superconductor .    in the same way we can compute the entire distribution of the transmission eigenvalues , @xmath42 . substituting @xmath43 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : tnphin ] ) , we find @xmath44    in fig .  1 we plot the resistance @xmath45 and @xmath46 , following from eqs .  ( [ gnsintphi ] ) and  ( [ gnintphi ] ) .",
    "notice that @xmath47 follows ohm s law , @xmath48 as expected from classical considerations .",
    "in contrast , the resistance @xmath49 has a _ minimum _ if one of the @xmath50 s is varied while keeping the other fixed .",
    "this resistance minimum can not be explained by classical series addition of barrier resistances . if @xmath51 is fixed and @xmath52 is varied , as in fig .  1",
    ", the minimum occurs when @xmath53 .",
    "the minimal resistance @xmath54 is of the same order of magnitude as the resistance @xmath47 in the normal state at the same value of @xmath52 and @xmath55 .",
    "( for @xmath51 , @xmath56 ) in particular , we find that @xmath57 depends linearly on @xmath58 , whereas for a single barrier @xmath59 .",
    "the linear dependence on the barrier transparency shows the qualitative similarity of a ballistic ninis junction to a disordered nis junction . to illustrate the similarity",
    ", we compare in fig .",
    "2 the densities of transmission eigenvalues throught the normal region .",
    "the left panel is for an nis junction ( computed using the results of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the right panel is for an ninis junction ( computed from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhot ] ) ) . in the nis junction",
    ", disorder leads to a bimodal distribution @xmath60 , with a peak near zero transmission and another peak near unit transmisssion ( dashed curve ) .",
    "a similar bimodal distribution appears in the ballistic ninis junction , for approximately equal transmission probabilities of the two barriers .",
    "there are also differences between the two cases : the nis junction has a unimodal @xmath60 if @xmath61 , while the ninis junction has a bimodal @xmath60 for any ratio of @xmath52 and @xmath55 . in both cases ,",
    "the opening of tunneling channels , _",
    "i.e. _ , the appearance of a peak in @xmath60 near @xmath62 , is the origin for the @xmath10 dependence of the resistance .",
    "let us now investigate what happens to the resistance minimum if the region of length @xmath4 between the tunnel barriers contains impurities , with elastic mean free path @xmath3 .",
    "we denote @xmath63 . when introducing disorder , it is necessary to consider ensemble - averaged quantities . to calculate the ensemble - averaged conductance @xmath64",
    ", we need to know the density @xmath65 of the transmission eigenvalues @xmath18 as a function of @xmath66 .",
    "it is convenient to work with the parameterization @xmath67 the density of the @xmath68 s is defined by @xmath69 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : tnphin ] ) we know that , for @xmath70 ( no disorder ) , @xmath71 for @xmath72 .    for @xmath73",
    "we obtain the density @xmath74 from the integro - differential equation  @xcite @xmath75 which is the large @xmath23-limit of the scaling equation due to dorokhov  @xcite and mello , pereyra , and kumar  @xcite .",
    "this equation describes the evolution of @xmath74 when an infinitesimal slice of disordered material is added . with initial condition ( [ eq : rhox0 ] ) it therefore describes a geometry where all disorder is on one side of the two tunnel barriers , rather than in between .",
    "in fact , only the total length @xmath4 of the disordered region matters , and not the location relative to the barriers .",
    "the argument is similar to that in ref .",
    "the total transfer matrix @xmath76 of the normal region is a product of the transfer matrices of its constituents ( barriers and disordered segments ) : @xmath77 . the probability distribution of @xmath76 is given by the convolution @xmath78 of the distributions @xmath79 of transfer matrices @xmath80 .",
    "the convolution is defined as @xmath81 if for all parts @xmath82 of the system , @xmath83 is a function of the eigenvalues of @xmath84 only , the convolution of the @xmath79 commutes  @xcite .",
    "the distributions @xmath79 are then called isotropic . a disordered segment ( length @xmath4 , width @xmath85 )",
    "has an isotropic distribution if @xmath86 .",
    "a planar tunnel barrier does not mix the modes , so a priori it does not have an isotropic distribution .",
    "however , if the mode - dependence of the transmission probabilities is neglected ( as we do here ) , it does not make a difference if we replace its distribution by an isotropic one .",
    "the commutativity of the convolution of isotropic distributions implies that the location of the tunnel barriers with respect to the disordered region does not affect @xmath74 .",
    "the systems in figs .",
    "3a , b , and c then have identical statistical properties .",
    "once @xmath74 is known , the conductances @xmath64 and @xmath87 can be determined from @xmath88 where we have substituted eq .",

    "the region near @xmath106 is of importance for the conductance ( since @xmath94 near zero corresponds to near - unit transmission ) .",

    "as the disorder becomes more dominant , a transition to a monotonic @xmath50-dependence takes place . in the limit of diffusive motion between the barriers ,",
    "our results agree with ref .",
    "@xcite .    throughout this paper",
    "we have assumed zero temperature , zero magnetic field , and infinitesimal applied voltage .",
    "each of these quantities is capable of destroying the phase coherence between the electrons and the andreev - reflected holes , which is responsible for the resistance minimum .",
    "as far as the temperature @xmath164 and voltage @xmath165 are concerned , we require @xmath166 for the appearance of a resistance minimum , where @xmath167 is the dwell time of an electron in the region between the two barriers . for a ballistic ninis junction",
    "we have @xmath168 , while for a disordered junction @xmath169 is larger by a factor @xmath170 .",
    "it follows that the condition on temperature and voltage becomes more restrictive if the disorder increases , even if the resistance remains dominated by the barriers .",
    "as far as the magnetic field @xmath171 is concerned , we require @xmath172 ( with @xmath173 the area of the junction perpendicular to @xmath171 ) , if the motion between the barriers is diffusive . for ballistic motion",
    "the trajectories enclose no flux , so no magetic field dependence is expected .",
    "a possible experiment to verify our results might be scanning tunneling microscopy of a metal particle on top of a superconducting substrate  @xcite .",
    "the metal - superconductor interface has a fixed tunnel probability @xmath55 .",
    "the probability @xmath52 for an electron to tunnel from stm to particle can be controlled by varying the distance .",
    "( volkov has recently analyzed this geometry in the regime that the motion from stm to particle is diffusive rather than by tunneling  @xcite . )",
    "another possibility is to create an ninis junction using a two - dimensional electron gas in contact with a superconductor .",
