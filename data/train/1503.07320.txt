    "many experiments have attempted to directly detect weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) dark matter candidates via their elastic scattering on target nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the lux experiment has recently limited the spin - independent cross sections to be under @xmath3 for 33 gev wimp mass  @xcite .",
    "a method that has commonly been used is to measure signals associated with the deposited energy of the nuclear recoil .",
    "however , background processes , such as those induced by neutrons , can mimic wimp signals  @xcite . to overcome this problem , a",
    "`` smoking gun '' wimp signal would be its unique directional event - rate dependence  @xcite . when viewed from the earth ,",
    "the average wimp velocity in galactic coordinates is from the cygnus direction , while the directions of background sources are fixed in an earth - based coordinate system .",
    "this effect can be seen by the directions of the recoiling nuclei that are strongly correlated with the directions of the incoming wimps  @xcite , and produce a diurnal variation of rates due the earth s rotation  @xcite .",
    "prospects for a working directional detector have focused on low pressure gas time projection chambers , such as drift - ii  @xcite , dmtpc  @xcite , newage  @xcite , mimac  @xcite , and the d@xmath4 prototype  @xcite , and emulsion techniques  @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of those detectors have been studied assuming they are either capable of reconstructing full three - dimensional ( 3d ) tracks  @xcite or only tracks projections on a particular detector - fixed plane ( 2d detector )  @xcite .",
    "it is found that of order tens of events are required to reject isotropy of recoil angle distributions , and the number of required events are one order of magnitude larger for a detector that can not measure the sense , defined as the absolute sign ( @xmath5 or @xmath6 ) , of the recoil vector .",
    "however , it is still a daunting task to fully reconstruct sub-100 kev nuclear recoil tracks .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a detector that can detect the polar angle of the recoil track with respect to a fixed @xmath7 axis , while the azimuthal angle is not measured . in the following ,",
    "we refer to this as a polar detector . in general ,",
    "since reconstruction of recoiling nucleus tracks is not required for a polar detector , the experimental realization can be more reliable and feasible .",
    "one issue for a directional dark matter detector is whether or not it possesses sense recognition capability , where we call the former a head - tail detector and the latter an axial detector .",
    "considerable technological effort is required to provide head - tail detection capability . throughout the paper ,",
    "the standard isothermal galactic halo model is used to model the wimp velocity distribution . in this case",
    ", a head - tail polar detector with @xmath7 axis aligned with the wimp wind direction has the same performance as a full 3d detector , because in this orientation the azimuthal distribution is completely flat and provides no information at all .",
    "one example of an axial polar detector is a stilbene crystal , which is an organic single crystal whose scintillation efficiency depends on the nuclear recoil direction relative to crystallographic axes  @xcite .",
    "recently , a new technique of columnar recombination ( cr ) has been shown to be capable of realizing a working axial polar detector  @xcite , without sense detection capability .",
    "the directional sensitivity in a cr detector comes from the dependence of electron - ion recombination level on the angle between recoil track and electric field . here",
    "the experimental signals are the scintillation light for the recombinations , and drift electrons from the surviving ionizations .    in most previous sensitivity studies such as those reported in refs .",
    "@xcite , the recoil energy is integrated out and only distributions with respect to angular variables are studied .",
    "when all the energies are integrated out , the shape of angular distribution does not depend on the wimp mass  @xcite and , thus , the distribution and the analysis are greatly simplified .",
    "however , we note that in a real experiment , all relevant information are used in order to achieve the highest possible sensitivity .",
    "thus , both energy and directional information are used simultaneously in this work .",
    "previous studies that did use both the energy and angular information  @xcite , treated the wimp mass as a known parameter that was kept at a fixed value in the fit . while this procedure is simpler to implement for producing plots of cross - section upper limits versus wimp mass , it is problematic for a general directional sensitivity calculation . in this study",
    ", we address this issue by treating the wimp mass as a nuisance parameter in a statistical framework that uses the well - established profile likelihood method .",
    "we study signals from spin - independent wimp - nucleus interactions , and assume zero background to provide benchmark results . for nonzero background experiments ,",
    "an observation of directionality still unambiguously leads to an observation of wimps , and the amount of directional sensitivity loss due to background is also studied .    in sections that follow ,",
    "we will start by calculating the distribution of observables , and then find the best orientations for various detector configurations using the standard profile likelihood method .",
    "later , the effects of background contamination are calculated for detectors in optimal orientations .",
    "finally , we study the performance of detectors using xenon target with various energy thresholds and wimp masses , and estimate the required detector exposure to see a three sigma directional signal .",
    "the general double - differential derivative of the recoil rate per unit target mass , with respect to nuclear recoil energy @xmath8 and solid angle @xmath9 in the nuclear recoil direction @xmath10 , can be expressed as  @xcite : @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the reduced mass of the wimp - nucleus system , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the wimp and target nucleus mass , respectively .",
    "@xmath15 is the form factor , @xmath16 is spin - independent wimp - nucleus cross - section , and @xmath17 is the number density of the wimp , where we use @xmath18 .",
    "the minimum wimp speed required for a recoil of energy @xmath8 is @xmath19 .",
    "the radon transform , @xmath20 , of the wimp velocity distribution @xmath21 represents the sum of the probability densities where the velocity projection on direction @xmath10 is equal to @xmath19 : @xmath22 in the standard isothermal galactic halo model , the distribution of wimp velocities @xmath23 relative to the target is maxwellian , with an average value of @xmath24 : @xmath25 in this case the radon transform is : @xmath26    the maximum recoil energy for a wimp with velocity @xmath27 is @xmath28 , and by reversing the formula , we obtain @xmath29 , with the definition @xmath30 .",
    "we also calculate the standard total rate @xmath31 when @xmath32 to be @xmath33 . for a a single target - nucleus type , the differential rate exhibits more physical meaning",
    "when it is expressed using @xmath34 and @xmath31 : @xmath35    it is convenient to define two variables : @xmath36 in a reference frame where the reference @xmath7 axis is parallel to the wimp wind direction , or the cygnus direction , the solid angle dependence reduces to polar angle @xmath37 dependence , and the differential rate can be expressed as : @xmath38    for simplicity , the peculiar velocity of the sun and the earth s orbital velocity about the sun are ignored and the velocity of earth @xmath39 is taken to be equal to the velocity of the local standard of rest @xmath40 . in this case the magnitude of @xmath39 and @xmath41 is same , which is usually given the value of 220 km / s .",
    "hence in this paper we use @xmath42 to represent the standard halo model .",
    "it is feasible to build a detector that is oriented at a fixed direction in space , where the wimp wind direction and the @xmath7 axis of detector form a fixed angle @xmath43 . in the frame of a detector system",
    ", the polar and azimuth angles of recoil @xmath44 and @xmath45 provide the directional information and the @xmath46 term in eq .",

    "the wimp wind direction is assumed to lie in the @xmath48 plane , without any loss in generality .",

    "( [ eqn : drdedcos ] ) .    for a detector where the only directional measurable is the polar angle @xmath44 , the azimuthal angle @xmath45 should be integrated out : @xmath52 for an axial detector where the sense of the recoil direction can not be distinguished",
    ", the distributions should be folded , as @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .",
    "now we consider a common case where a detector is fixed in the earth s coordinate frame .",
    "since the earth itself is rotating , the angle @xmath43 modulates with a period of one sidereal day .",
    "the wimp wind from cygnus is directed to the earth at a constant angle @xmath55 to the earth s polar axis , as shown in fig .",

    "since @xmath57 distributes uniformly within 0 and 1 when all energies and angles are considered , the appropriate distribution for the earth - fixed case , now in terms of ( @xmath59 ) , @xmath60 , is determined by replacing @xmath43 in eq .",

    "( [ eqn : costheta0 ] ) and integrating out @xmath45 .",
    "note that here , instead of using angular information only as in  @xcite , we use two and three dimensional distributions that include energy and sidereal time as additional variables .",
    "the most common method that is used in particle physics to determine significance of an observation is the profile likelihood ratio test statistic method .",
    "it uses a hypothesis test against a null or trivial hypothesis @xmath61 , where the data is assumed to correspond to the distribution of an alternative or interesting hypothesis @xmath62 .",

    "for example , a @xmath69 value of 0.00135 corresponds to a @xmath72 signal significance . in principle , the distribution @xmath73 needs to be obtained using monte carlo methods with high statistics .",

    "the sensitivity decrease for high wimp masses is due to the form factor , which suppresses the high energy recoils .",
    "the most sensitive wimp - mass value increases as the energy threshold increases , and is around 30 gev for a 10 kev threshold and 50 gev for a 30 kev threshold .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : q_mw - xffc2-mw2 ] shows that the performance of earth - fixed detectors follows the same behavior as space - fixed case with respect to wimp - mass and energy - threshold dependence , except for an overall sensitivity that is lower by a factor of about three , which is consistent with the general study in sec .",
    "[ sec : gen ] .",
    "we can also compare the decrease in sensitivity to the decrease in the observed event rate due to the energy threshold cut .",
    "for example , for a 30 gev wimp , an energy threshold change from 3 kev to 10 kev , decreases the sensitivity by only 23% , compared to the 71% decrease in the total number of observed events .",
    "this is due to the fact that most directional information comes from the high recoil energy events , so that a cut on low energy events has minor impact .",
    "for a detector with high energy threshold of 30 kev , a wimp mass in the intermediate range around 50 gev is most promising , with the sensitivity that is 3.2 times below that of a 3 kev - threshold detector for the same range .",
    "last three rows of table  [ tab : ensxe_neq9_n12 ] show the required point interaction numbers for a @xmath72 discovery under several wimp - mass and energy - threshold combinations . in a typical case of a 30 gev wimp mass and a 10 kev energy threshold ,",
    "the numbers are @xmath150 and @xmath151 , for space- and earth - fixed xenon polar detectors .",
    "these correspond to @xmath1 and @xmath152 kg@xmath2year exposures for a @xmath153 spin - independent wimp - nucleon cross - section .",
    "a columnar recombination detector using high pressure xenon - tma gas mixture can measure the angle between the nuclear recoil track and electric drift field  @xcite , without sense recognition capability .",
    "thus it is an axial polar detector .",
    "the columnar effect benefits from a high penning efficiency as the percentage of the xenon excitations that fall back to free electrons by ionizing the tma molecules . for electron and gamma energy deposit ,",
    "the penning efficiency is estimated to be around 10% and 20% in ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite , and also indirectly measured to be 10%-15% in high pressure xenon gas with tma mixture  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the primary scintillation from xenon is observed to be absorbed by the tma mixture  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the columnar recombination effect for the ionization channel has been seen for the alpha particle events as shown in fig .  5 of ref .",
    "@xcite , where , as a first approximation , the collected charge is a linear function of @xmath154 .",
    "further studies are needed to obtain a high penning efficiency for the high initial ionization density produced by nuclear recoils .    to date",
    ", no experimental results on the properties of nuclear recoils in a columnar recombination material is available .",
    "once a reliable detector response is available , a detector resolution can be straightforwardly included in our model to obtain the sensitivity . despite this limitation",
    ", we have tested a naive resolution smearing method for nuclear recoils based on the following considerations : ( a ) the recombination fraction of the electron - ion pairs ranges from 0.8 for recoils that are parallel(@xmath155 ) to 0.4 for those that are perpendicular ( @xmath156 ) to the field direction ; ( b ) an ionization work function of 76 ev for the electron - ion pairs ; and ( c ) 10% and 50% efficiency for the recombination ( scintillation ) and ionization channels with gaussian resolutions calculated from a fano factor  @xcite of 0.14  @xcite for xenon gas .",
    "the resulting sensitivity is only worsened by 7% relative to the zero resolution case .",
    "this can be understood as that the directionality is derived from an overall anisotropic phenomenon and not from a localized spot .",
    "reference  @xcite also noted that variations in angular resolution do not make much difference in the dark matter detection sensitivity .",
    "thus we do not expect a significant change to our sensitivity results by detector resolution effects .",
    "the performance of a directional dark matter detector with polar angle detection is studied for various configurations .",
    "a wimp - mass independent method is used to obtain the sensitivity of a general detector .",
    "in addition , a detector with xenon as target material is studied .",
    "we infer that :    * both axial and head - tail polar detectors have the highest sensitivity when the @xmath7 axis is aligned with wimp wind .",
    "however , the dependence of sensitivity to detector orientation is not monotonic for an axial detector . to obtain optimal performance when rotating with the earth",
    ", the @xmath7 axis should be oriented at 45 degree to earth s pole for an axial detector , while it should be aligned with earth s polar axis for a head - tail detector .",
    "* a head - tail polar detector can detect directionality with of order 10 or 20 events on a space- or earth - fixed basis . in the absence of sense detection capability , an order of magnitude more statistics is needed . * without using energy information simultaneously , the required statistics would be a factor of @xmath157 times higher for a space ( earth)-fixed axial detector",
    ". this conclusion will be useful for detector types in which partial directional information is available , such as a 2d planar detector . * a general axial polar detector with @xmath106 times the statistics has the same performance as a general full 3d tracking detector .",
    "however , in experimental practice , the target mass for a full 3d detector is limited because of diffusion effects , and accomplishing millimeter tracking is extremely challenging . on the other hand",
    ", a detector with polar angle sensitivity without head - tail discrimination requirement can use straightforward experimental techniques .",
    "in addition , it can be made in large volume with high - density gas , with a target mass that can be orders of magnitude larger than a conventional full 3d detector .",
    "we conclude that it is of great advantage to explore the directional dark matter detection technique using a senseless polar angle detection apparatus .",
    "* a space - fixed detector is generally found to be 3 and 2 times more sensitive than an earth - fixed detector , for axial and head - tail configurations .",
    "this ratio is an important factor when comparing the additional cost for a space fixed detector , since it has to rotate all the time with respect to the earth . in a space - fixed detector , to distinguish between the wimp signal from the galaxy coordinate and possible anisotropic background originating from the detector frame , manually reversing the detector @xmath7 axis direction for half of the measurement period should be useful .",
    "* in the presence of contamination by an isotropic background that mimics the energy shape of the signal , the decrease of directional sensitivity occurs at a rate that is less than the decrease of signal purity .",
    "thus a polar detector is robust against background .",
    "the space - fixed axial configuration is least affected by such backgrounds . * for an axial xenon polar detector , the decrease of sensitivity due to the effect of the energy threshold is much smaller than the decrease of the total event rate . a @xmath1 or @xmath152 kg@xmath2year exposure can reach a @xmath72 directional signal on a space- or earth - fixed basis with 10 kev energy threshold , for a @xmath153 wimp - nucleon cross - section and a 30 gev wimp mass .    the author would like to thank adam para , jonghee yoo , yeongduk kim and stephen olsen for useful discussions .",
