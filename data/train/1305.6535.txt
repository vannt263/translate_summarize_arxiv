    "heavy quarkonium states ( like @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) and their decay modes offer a laboratory to study the strong interaction in the non - perturbative regime . charmonium in particular has served as a calibration tool for the corresponding techniques and models @xcite .",
    "heavy quarkonium states can have many bound states and decay channels used to study and determine different parameters of standard model(sm ) and qcd from the theoretical perspective . in particular , the calculation of bottomonium masses@xcite",
    ", total widths , coupling constants@xcite and branching ratio can serve as benchmarks for the low energy predictions of qcd .",
    "in addition , the theoretical calculations on the branching ratio of radiative decays of heavy quarkonium states , are relatively clean with respect to the hadronic or semileptonic decays , and their comparison with experimental data could provide inportant insights into their nature and hyperfine interaction . in this regard ,",
    "we present the first theoretical study on the branching ratio of inclusive and decays .",
    "note that in order to calculate the branching ratio we have to get information about the masses and decay constants of the participating particles .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the masses can be obtained either by means of the experimental results i.e , the particle data group@xcite or by the theoretical methods .",
    "the decay constants , on the other hand , can be calculated theoretically via different non - perturbative methods . in this respect ,",
    "masses and decay constants and spectrums of heavy qurakonium states are calculated in the various approaches ( see for instance @xcite-@xcite ) . here ,",
    "firstly , we calculate the form factor of and decays in the framework of three - ponit qcd sum rules , secondly we calculate the branching ratio of inclusive and decays . in section 2 , we introduce the qcd sum rules technique for the form factors of inclusive and decays .",
    "last section is devoted to the numerical analysis and discussion .",
    "the three - point correlation function associated with the @xmath0 and @xmath1 vertex is given by @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the time ordering operator and @xmath10 is momentum of photon .",
    "each meson and photon field can be described in terms of the quark field operators as follows : @xmath11    we calculate the correlation function eq .",
    "( [ correlationfunc1 ] ) in two different methods . in phenomenological or physical side",
    ", it can be evaluated in terms of hadronic parameters such as masses , decay constants and form factors . in theoretical or qcd side ,",
    "on the other hand , it is calculated in terms of qcd parameters , which are quark and gluon degrees of freedom , by the help of the operator product expansion ( ope ) in deep euclidean region .",
    "equating the structure calculated in two different approaches of the same correlation function , we get a relation between hadronic parameters and qcd degrees of freedom .",
    "finally , we apply double borel transformation with respect to the momentum of initial and final mesons(@xmath12 and @xmath13 ) .",
    "this final operation suppresses the contribution of the higher states and continuum .",
    "we insert the complete sets of appropriate vector meson(@xmath14 ) and scalar meson(@xmath15 ) states ( regarding the conservation of the quantum numbers of corresponding interpolating currents ) inside correlation functions eq.([correlationfunc1 ] ) . here",
    ", vector state is either @xmath16 or @xmath17 and scalar state is @xmath18 state . after integrating over the @xmath19 and @xmath20 ,",
    "we get the following result for the correlation function eq.([correlationfunc1 ] ) : @xmath21 where .... contains the contribution of the higher and continuum states with the same quantum numbers .",
    "the matrix elements of the above equation are related to the hadronic parameters as follows : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the form factor of transition and @xmath24 is the polarization vector associated with the vector meson . using eq .",
    "( [ transitionamp ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ correlationfuncphys1 ] ) and considering the summation over polarization vectors via , @xmath25 the result of the phenomenological or physical side is as follows : @xmath26 we are going to compare the coefficient of @xmath27 structure for further calculation from different approaches of the correlation functions .",
    "theoretical side consists of perturbative(bare loop see fig .",
    "( [ bare ] ) and non - perturbative parts(the contributions of two gluon condensate diagrams fig .",
    "( [ gluon ] ) ) .",
    "we calculate it in the deep euclidean space ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) .",
    "we consider this side as : @xmath30      the perturbative part is a double dispersion integral as follows :        @xmath31    where , @xmath32 is called spectral density .",
    "we aim to evaluate the spectral density with the help of the bare loop diagram in fig.([bare ] ) .",
    "one of the generic methods to calculate this bare loop integral is the cutkosky method , where the quark propagators of feynman integrals are replaced by the dirac delta functions : @xmath33 then , using the cutkosky method we get spectral density as : @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the color number .",
    "note that , since three @xmath37 functions of integrand must vanish simultaneously , the physical regions in the @xmath38 - @xmath39 plane must satisfy the following inequality : @xmath40      we consider the two gluon condensate diagrams .",
    "note that , we do not add the heavy quarks condensates , because the heavy quark contributions are suppressed by the inverse of the heavy quark mass , so they can be safely neglected .",
    "now , as a nonperturbative part , we must add contributions coming from the gluon condensates presented in ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , ( d ) , ( e ) and ( f ) in fig .",
    "( [ gluon ] ) .",
    "these diagrams are calculated in the fock ",
    "schwinger fixed ",
    "point gauge@xcite where , the vacuum gluon field is as follows : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the gluon momentum and @xmath43 is the gluon field .",
    "in addition , the quark - gluon - quark vertex is used as : @xmath44    we come across the following integrals in calculating the gluon condensate contributions @xcite : [ e7323 ] i_0[a , b , c ] =  , +   + i_=  , where @xmath45 is the momentum of the spectator quark @xmath46 .",
    "these integrals are calculated by shifting to the euclidean space  time and using the schwinger representation for the euclidean propagator : [ e7324 ] = _ 0^d ^n-1 e^-(k^2+m^2 )  .",
    "this kind of expression is very easy for the borel transformation since [ e7325 ] b_^2 ( m^2 ) e^-p^2 = ( 1/m^2- )  .",
    "where @xmath47 is borel parameter .",
    "we perform integration over the loop momentum and over the two parameters which we use in the exponential representation of propagators @xcite . as a final operation",
    "we apply double borel transformations to @xmath12 and @xmath48 .",
    "we get the borel transformed form of the integrals in eq . ( [ e7323 ] ) as :    [ e7326 ] ( a , b , c ) & = & i ( m_1 ^ 2)^2-a - b ( m_2",
    "^ 2)^2-a - c u_0(a+b+c-4,1-c - b )  , +   + _ ( a , b , c ) & = & ( a , b , c ) p_+ ( a , b , c ) p _  , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the borel parameters .",
    "the function @xmath52 is as follows : _",
    "0(a , b ) = _ 0^dy ( y+m_1 ^ 2+m_2 ^ 2)^a y^b exp  , where [ e7328 ] b_-1 & = &  , + b_0 & = &  , + b_1 & = &  .    where the circumflex of @xmath53 in the equations is used for the results after the double borel transformation . as a result of the lengthy calculations we obtain the following expressions for the two gluon condensate",
    ": @xmath54 now , we can compare @xmath27 coefficient of eq .",
    "( [ correlationfuncphys2 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ correlationfuncqcd ] ) .",
    "our result related to the sum rules for the corresponding form factor is as follows :    @xmath55e^{\\frac{-s}{m^2}}e^{\\frac{-s^{\\prime } } { { m^{\\prime}}^2}}+\\pi_{nonper}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that , finally we have to set @xmath56 for the real photon .",
    "in this section we calculate the value of form factors and the barching ratios .",
    "we use , @xmath57 , @xmath58@xcite , @xmath59@xcite , @xmath60@xcite,@xmath61@xcite,@xmath62mev@xcite , @xmath63@xcite , @xmath64@xcite , @xmath65@xcite , @xmath66 @xcite and the full width for @xmath67 : @xmath68 mev@xcite .    to do further numerical analyses we have to know the value or range of the auxiliary parameters of qcd sum rules .",
    "those are the continuum thresholds ( @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) and the borel mass parameters ( @xmath71 and @xmath72 ) .",
    "the physical results are required to be either weakly depend on or independent of aforementioned parameters .",
    "therefore , we must consider the working regions of these auxiliary parameters where the dependence of the form factors are weak .",
    "we also consider the working regions for the borel mass parameters @xmath71 and @xmath72 in a way that both the contributions of the higher states and continuum are sufficiently suppressed and the contributions coming from higher dimensions operators can be ignored . with the aforementioned conditions , we get , @xmath73 and @xmath74 for decays and @xmath75 and @xmath76 for decays",
    ".    the continuum thresholds , @xmath69 and @xmath70 must not be greater than the energy of the first excited states with the same quantum numbers . in our numerical calculations",
    "the following regions for the continuum thresholds in @xmath38 and @xmath77 channels are used : @xmath78 and @xmath79 for @xmath38 and @xmath39 channels , respectively . here , @xmath80 is the mass of either @xmath81 or @xmath4 meson and @xmath82 is the mass of either @xmath16 or @xmath17 meson .",
    "note that , we follow the standard procedure in the qcd sum rules , where the continuum thresholds are suppossed to be independent of borel mass parameters and @xmath83 .",
    "however , this assumption is not free of uncertainties(see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the detailed analysis of the form factor shows us that dependence of form factor best fits into the following function : @xmath84 where we @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 for and @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 for decays .",
    "using @xmath91 in eq .",
    "( [ fitfunction ] ) , we obtain the @xmath92 and the @xmath93 for and decays , respectively .",
    "the errors in our numerical calculation are the results of both the interval of the working regions for the auxiliary parameters and the uncertainties of the input parameters .",
    "the matix element for the decay of and is as follows : @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath24 are the momentum and polarization of final state vector meson i.e. , either @xmath16 or @xmath17 mesons , @xmath96 is the polarization of real photon and @xmath97 is the momentum of initial scalar meson .    using this matix element",
    ", we get : @xmath98 where @xmath80 is mass of either @xmath81 or @xmath4 meson and @xmath82 is either mass of @xmath16 or @xmath17 meson .",
    "the decay width for decays is as : @xmath99    the branching ratio of can be evaluated with the eq .",
    "( [ ndecay])and the numerical value of @xmath100 that is as : @xmath101 this result is in good agreement with the experimental measurement@xcite which is : @xmath102 we get @xmath93 for decays .",
    "using this value we calculate the decay width as follows : @xmath103 this decay width and the measured branching ratio @xmath104@xcite allow us to evaluate the total width of @xmath4 .",
