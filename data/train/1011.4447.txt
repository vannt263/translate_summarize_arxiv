    "the investigation of hubbard type models with regard to solutions exhibiting modulated magnetic order is to a large extent motivated by ( in)elastic neutron scattering experiments on high - temperature superconductors ( for an overview cf . ref . ) . especially in the underdoped regime many compounds show a pronounced low energy spin response which is peaked away from the antiferromagnetic wave - vector . for overdoped samples of lanthanum cuprates it has been shown @xcite that these low energy incommensurate spin fluctuations vanish at the same concentration where superconductivity disappears thus suggesting a close relation between both phenomena .",
    "there are basically three possibilities which can account for the observed incommensurate spin response .",
    "first , the system can be close to a magnetic instability which in a random - phase approximation based treatment would strongly enhance the magnetic susceptibiliy at the corresponding wave - vectors .",
    "moreover , in case of a superconducting ( sc ) d - wave gap the depletion of low energy spectral weight induces quasi undamped low energy incommensurate spin excitations which merge at the antiferromagnetic wave - vector into the famous resonance peak .",
    "@xcite this scenario is very popular in optimally doped ybco , since the experimentally observed energy of the resonance peak scales with the sc transition temperature @xmath2 as expected for this model .",
    "however , one could also envisage a situation of real symmetry breaking in the spin channel where ( in terms of the above counting ) the second and third possibilities correspond to ordered phases in the transverse and longitudinal spin channel , respectively .",
    "since the charge couples to the square of the magnetic order parameter one expects in the latter case also a concomitant charge modulation . in lanthanum cuprates ( lco ) , doped with ba or codoped with nd or eu ,  @xcite the third scenario is now well established . in these compounds",
    "the spin response even becomes static and concomitant charge order appears , which first was evidenced through the coupling to the lattice @xcite but recently more directly through soft resonant x - ray scattering .",
    "@xcite the fact that the periodicity of the charge modulation is half that of the spin strongly suggests that these materials have a so called ` striped ground state ' , i.e. quasi one dimensional antiphase domain walls of the antiferromagnetic order host the doped charge carriers .",
    "a polarized neutron scattering study on la@xmath3nd@xmath4sr@xmath5cuo@xmath6@xcite in fact suggests that the magnetic order is one - dimensionally modulated although some two - dimensional noncollinear structure @xcite may not be excluded .",
    "it is worth noting that stripe textures have been predicted as stable hartree - fock ( hf ) saddle points of the hubbard model @xcite before they were found experimentally in cuprates ( and nickelates ) .",
    "however , it was realized early on that one has to include correlations beyond hf in order to correctly describe the experimental data in lanthanum cuprates . in the past years",
    "two of us have performed detailed investigations within the gutzwiller approximation ( ga ) supplemented with gaussian fluctuations which allowed for the explanation of the doping dependent incommensurability and various transport properties @xcite , the optical conductivity @xcite and magnetic excitations @xcite on the basis of striped ground states .",
    "non codoped lanthanum cuprates show a low energy inelastic incommensurability with a doping dependence rather similar to that of the codoped compounds suggesting the existence of some form of fluctuating and ( or ) disordered stripe order .",
    "moreover , below a doping @xmath7 the magnetic response rotates from vertical ( i.e. along the cu - o bond direction ) to diagonal , becoming static and one - dimensional with the associated modulation along the orthorombic @xmath8-axis , also in agreement with the stripe picture . on the other hand , direct probes of charge order are more difficult to obtain , leaving some room for the existence of incommensurate magnetic structures without charge order such as spirals .",
    "although there are good hints from local probes like nmr , nqr @xcite and tunneling@xcite that point to charge ordered states , it is worth examining the possibility that transverse spin ( spiral ) textures exist .",
    "even more controversial is the situation in ybco , the second class of high - t@xmath9 compounds which have been intensively investigated by neutron scattering ( ns ) experiments .",
    "@xcite since in optimally doped ybco the low energy incommensurate magnetic response shows up below t@xmath9 , one line of thought is that the signal corresponds to the dispersion of a bound exciton which is formed inside a d - wave superconducting gap .",
    "@xcite however , it should be noted that for underdoped ybco the observation of an incommensurate ( and even static ) spin response also above t@xmath9 @xcite raises questions about this interpretation . in any case , the lack of experimental evidence for charge modulation in ybco ( which if dynamic or disordered is of course hard to detect ) makes it difficult to conclusively attribute the incommensurate magnetic response to stripes as in codoped lco , though it has been successfully described within a model based on slowly fluctuating ( or disordered ) charge stripes .",
    "@xcite also the quantum oscillations found in underdoped ybco @xcite are compatible with a reconstruction of the fermi surface due to stripe order .",
    "@xcite    due to the lack of large single crystals other cuprate superconductors are less intensively studied by ns than the aforementioned compounds .",
    "however , a recent study has revealed elastic incommensurate magnetic peaks in an overdoped bi@xmath10pb@xmath11sr@xmath12cuo@xmath13 sample [ ( bi , pb)2201 ] codoped with iron .",
    "@xcite within the error bars the doping @xmath14 and the measured incommensurability @xmath15 seem to extend the relation @xmath16 ( which holds for underdoped lanthanum cuprates @xcite ) to large doping without saturation at @xmath17 .",
    "an alternative to stripes in order to account for the incommensurate spin response in cuprates is based on the formation of spirals .",
    "these textures are characterized by a homogeneous periodic and planar rotation of the cu moments with no associated charge modulation .",
    "thus at first glance spirals seem to be a promising candidate for those cuprates in which incommensurate magnetic fluctuations have been observed without charge fluctuations , and corresponding theories have been recently put forward in refs . .    within hubbard - type models",
    "spiral solutions have been investigated on the basis of hf ,  @xcite slave - boson ( or ga ) @xcite and dynamical mean - field @xcite calculations .",
    "the energies of stripes and spirals have been computed within hf @xcite and slave - boson methods @xcite based on the hubbard model .",
    "these latter investigations have found a strong influence of the ratio between next - nearest and nearest neighbor hopping @xmath0 on the respective stability of both textures .",
    "here our starting point is similar , however , we show that the low doping phase separation instability of spirals can lead to the formation of nanoscale charge and spin inhomogeneities with substantial spin canting .",
    "stripes and spirals should therefore be viewed only as limiting cases of these more complex spin and charge textures .",
    "we discuss our findings with regard to recent neutron scattering experiments on iron - codoped lanthanum @xcite and bismuth @xcite cuprate superconductors .",

    "@xmath41 the @xmath35-matrix becomes diagonal and the renormalization factors    @xmath42    reduce to those of the standard ga .",
    "spiral solutions are then computed by minimizing @xmath43 with respect to a homogeneous rotation of spins with wave - vector @xmath44 @xmath45 in the present paper we usually measure modulations with respect to af order @xmath46 ( lattice constant @xmath47 ) and set @xmath48 .",
    "stripe solutions are obtained by restricting the magnetization to the @xmath49 direction resulting in a modulation of @xmath50 with @xmath44 and a simultaneous modulation of @xmath51 with @xmath52 similar to our previous work .",

    "these double nesting points determine the maximum susceptibilities and are always found to lie along high - symmetry directions .",

    "however , we have checked by explicitly evaluating spirals and stripes within the three - band model that the conclusions of the present paper stay valid but the role of @xmath0 is played by the oxygen - oxygen hopping parameter . in fig .",
    "[ fig1b ] we also show data from recent neutron scattering experiments @xcite on fe - lsco . in these overdoped samples",
    "an elastic incommensurate spin response was found close to the dominant nesting vectors as extracted from arpes experiments .",
    "it was thus concluded that the induced incommensurate response signals an inherent instability of the itinerant charge carriers , being different from the low doping stripes arising from localized cu spins . within our calculations ( cf .",
    "[ fig1b ] ) the data are rather close to the incommensurability curve of stripes obtained for @xmath66 , which is the appropriate value for lsco .",
    "since our calculations are based on an itinerant approach , there is no ` dichotomy ' between low doping ` localized ' spin stripes and large doping itinerant ones , but both appear as different limits of the same model .",
    "in fact , at these large dopings one can also regard the stripes as arising from an instability of the ` nearby ' ( in energy ) paramagnet similar to the spiral case as discussed in context to fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in other words , increasing the doping one can go continuously from a stripe state at low doping to an itinerant spin - density wave ( sdw ) at high doping which disappears at a second order transition to become a uniform paramagnet .    at",
    "fixed doping one finds an analogous sdw instability with increasing @xmath24 . for @xmath66 and @xmath139",
    "the spin density wave instability occurs at @xmath140 and critical interaction @xmath141 .",
    "we can therefore view the @xmath142 stripes ( which have a similar periodicity ) as the realization of this instability whereas spirals for these parameters have higher energy .",
    "our ga calculations yield a charge modulation of only @xmath143 for the @xmath142 stripes at @xmath144 which should be considered as an upper bound since our calculation neglects the effect of fluctuations",
    ". it may be therefore experimentally difficult to distinguish between a stripe and spiral state in this doping range .",
    "for larger values of @xmath1 as relevant for e.g. bismuthate high - t@xmath9 cuprates we have found that spiral textures are lower in energy than stripes in which canting is not allowed .",
    "if this latter restriction is relaxed , stripes and checkerboard states with a substantial spin canting become again more stable .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that spirals are unstable at low doping towards phase separation so that stripes and checkerboard states can be seen as nanoscale phase separated states .",
    "it is interesting to remark that the more stable stripe at small doping is a novel kind of stripe with a fractional change in the phase of the order parameter as opposed to the usual @xmath145 change .",
    "these states can be experimentally detected because they have a finite bragg peak weight both at the commensurate af wave vector @xmath146 and at the incommensurate positions but can also be easily confused with phase separation among stripes and the commensurate antiferromagnet phase .    as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3](b ) and [ fig4](b ) the spin canting induces the flow of dm spin currents along the bonds of the lattice which are associated with the force flux @xmath117 . due to the breaking of inversion symmetry arising from the oxygen displacements",
    ", such dm spin currents may be associated with an electric polarization @xmath147 .",
    "@xcite    for the diagonal structure shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) , @xmath148 would point along the stripe but in alternate directions from stripe to stripe .",
    "on the other hand , in the nearly af ordered regions between the domain walls the dm spin currents and thus the electric polarization almost vanish .",
    "the spin canted stripe can therefore also be considered as a one - dimensional ` antiferroelectric ' with a vanishing net polarization .",
    "@xcite    in the overdoped regime and for sufficiently large @xmath1 spirals do not phase separate and under certain conditions may constitute the ground state in cuprate superconductors . in this regard ,",
    "the recent elastic ns study @xcite on ( bi , pb)2201 codoped with iron is interesting since it reveals incommensurate magnetic correlations with @xmath15 at a doping concentration @xmath14 .",
    "our present computations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1b ] suggest that the elastic neutron scattering data from ref . are compatible with vertical spirals",
    "provided that the value of the next - nearest hopping for bi2201 is in the range @xmath149 .",
    "lda calculations by pavarini and coworkers @xcite yield a value of @xmath150 for bi@xmath111sr@xmath111cuo@xmath151 where our results ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) suggest that vertical spirals are still more favorable than diagonal ones and may even dominate over stripes . naturally ,",
    "our computations which are for perfectly modulated spirals , can only be qualitative since the measured coherence length of the magnetic modulation @xcite is of the order of the iron distance",
    ". therefore additional effects like disorder and the magnetic moments arising from the fe dopants should also be taken into account which is , however , beyond the scope of the present paper .    in the underdoped regime",
    "it is unlikely that uniform spirals will survive .",
    "although for large @xmath1 the phase separated spiral has nominally lower energy than the stripes , the macroscopically phase separated state implies a charge imbalance @xmath152 per cu which would result in a prohibitive coulomb cost.@xcite even without long - range coulomb interaction a nanoscale phase separated state has lower energy .",
    "clearly the spin polarons , the checkerboard states as well as stripes , having charge inhomogeneities , will couple with impurities resulting in a spin and charge spin glass state consistent with experiments .",
    "since this state will have substantial spin - canting it becomes rather semantic to distinguish it from the disordered spiral ground state as proposed by sushkov .",
    "@xcite for small @xmath1 we expect that short - range diagonal stripes order dominates in this state as observed experimentally although with a correlation length of the static incommensurate response of the same order as the periodicity .",
    "@xcite one should therefore rather think of a disordered state with meandering stripe which can profit from the impurity potential .",
