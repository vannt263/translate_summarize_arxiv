    "according to general relativity and other alternative theories of gravity , photons are deflected and delayed by the curvature of space - time produced by any mass distribution . in the gravitational field of a static spherical mass",
    "the bending and delay are proportional to @xmath2 , where @xmath0 parametrizes the curvature of space and measures the degree of deviation of a gravity theory from general relativity @xcite .",
    "the most precise measurement of @xmath0 has been recently achieved in the cassini experiment @xcite by fitting the doppler data to the general - relativistic model used in the jpl orbit determination program @xcite .",
    "the odp calculates the time delay in the heliocentric frame and transforms it to the barycentric frame of the solar system by using spatial translations of participating bodies from the heliocentric to the barycentric frame .",
    "we demonstrate in this _",

    "the lorentz transformation of the gravitational field to the barycentric frame brings about the gravimagnetic , @xmath6 , component of the metric tensor @xcite .",
    "moreover , it makes _ all _ components of the barycentric metric time - dependent , so that its partial time derivatives do not vanish .",
    "this non - stationarity of the solar gravity in the barycentric frame is associated with the gravimagnetic field caused by the translational current of sun s matter @xcite .",
    "this _ letter _ shows that the barycentric orbital velocity of the sun gives rise to gravimagnetic shift of frequency , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the solar gravitational deflection of light , @xmath9 m / s is the barycentric velocity of the sun during the time of the cassini experiment 2002 , and @xmath10 is the speed of light . for the light grazing the solar limb @xmath11 rad , and @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , detection of the gravimagnetic frequency shift @xmath13 is to be _",
    "possible _ in ranging experiments like the cassini having precision @xmath14 , or better . during the time",
    "radio signal travels from the spacecraft to the earth the motion of the sun can be approximated as uniform along a straight line as the solar acceleration , @xmath15 , produces relativistic effect that is negligible for the cassini but may be detected in future experiments @xcite .",
    "this acceleration - induced frequency shift @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the distance spacecraft - observer , @xmath18 is the solar radius , and we have used @xmath19 as the radius of the solar orbit around the barycentre is about @xmath18 .    in what follows",

    "equation ( [ 0 ] ) is valid in the post - newtonian approximation and includes all relativistic terms of the order of @xmath44 in addition to the first term in the right side of equation ( [ -1 ] ) . in the precise experiments like the cassini some terms of the higher order of @xmath45",

    "the most important of these higher - order terms are included to the odp but are omitted here because we focus on the discussion of the velocity - dependent , gravimagnetic effects while the terms of the higher order are static .",
    "the odp computes doppler shift by differencing numerically the time delay equations ( [ -1 ] ) , ( [ 0 ] ) at the beginning , @xmath30 , and the end , @xmath32 , of the integration time .",
    "this procedure needs better theoretical understanding and is described here analytically in the approximation of a small impact parameter @xmath46 of the radio link that is sufficient for our subsequent discussion . in this approximation equation ( [ 0 ] )",

    "the asymmetry between subscripts 1 and 0 in the last term of equation ( [ 1az ] ) is because of the derivative @xmath68 that appears any time when one differentiates functions depending on @xmath69 as @xmath70 .",
    "the first two terms in the right side of equation ( [ 1 ] ) were obtained by @xcite .",
    "however , the analytic theory of the cassini experiment should also incorporate the term @xmath71 given in equation ( [ 1az ] ) .",
    "indeed , the r.m.s . value of data points in the cassini measurement corresponded to a one - way range rate of @xmath72 m / s @xcite .",

    "all time - dependent terms that are proportional to the barycentric velocity of the sun , @xmath94 , are called gravimagnetic @xcite and are associated with the gravimagnetic effect in the doppler shift .",
    "precise equations describing the lorentz transformation of the gravity field and their connection to the propagation of light are given in @xcite .",
    "as we are interested only in the gravimagnetic shift of frequency of the first order , it suffices to approximate equation ( [ c2 ] ) by making use of the taylor expansion of @xmath88 with respect to @xmath95 and to work with a few first terms .",
    "this reduces equation ( [ c2 ] ) to the post - galilean transformation @xmath96 it is important to emphasize that the term proportional to @xmath94 in equation ( [ 5 ] ) is , effectively , a linear order with respect to @xmath97 , as it is obtained from the contraction of @xmath98 from equation ( [ mat1 ] ) with time coordinate @xmath99 .",

    "statistical meaning of partial derivatives ( [ p1 ] ) and ( [ p2 ] ) is that they are components of the covariance matrix of the fitting parameters .",
    "the fact , that they have different functional dependence , points out that parameters @xmath0 and @xmath133 are uncorrelated and , hence , can be separated with confidence in the data fitting procedure .",
    "the cassini experiment was conducted in june 2002 when radio waves from / to the spacecraft had passed at the minimal distance @xmath140 @xmath18 from the sun .",
