    "given interactions of weak strength and masses in the range of 0.11  tev these generic wimps naturally give the observed dm density as a thermal relic of the expansion of the early universe .",
    "several extensions of the sm include such a wimp candidate , e.  g.  susy with conserved r - parity , where the lsp often is either the lightest neutralino @xmath0 or the gravitino @xmath1 .",
    "direct wimp pair production @xmath2 should be possible at the international linear collider  ( ilc )  @xcite for wimp masses of less than half the cms energy , @xmath3 .",

    "this detection channel does not only give additional information on the new particles , but it might as well be the only kinematically allowed process at the ilc .",
    "this is the case when only one new particle exists in the energy range of the ilc . in supersymmetric scenarios",
    "the other susy masses might be just above the production threshold , preventing the production of the lsp via the decay of heavier particles . without the need for heavier particles to be produced , isr searches extend the ilc reach on wimp masses to @xmath4  gev , just below half the cms energy .",
    "a model independent description of isr associated wimp pair production can be derived as in  @xcite . under the assumption of only one new particle responsible for the cdm the annihilation cross section of a wimp pair into an @xmath5 pair can be estimated from the observed dm relic density  ( fig .",

    "a good understanding of the material budget is important for the evaluation of the systematic effects from photon conversions on the event reconstruction .",
    "the angular dependence of the material budget that particles originating from the interaction point are exposed to on their way out through the tracking subsystems  ( vertex detector , tpc , intermediate trackers and support structures ) can be evaluated in the detector simulation by counting the number @xmath13 of photons generated and the number @xmath14 of photons not converted before reaching the ecal face .",

    "the lower cut on the photon energies ensures that the recoiling wimp system is non - relativistic .",

    "the loss of sensitivity to higher masses is due to the kinematic limit , while for lower masses the signal is increasingly reduced by the lower cut on the photon energies .",
    "figure  [ fig : k1](b ) shows the reach for the case where the wimps  ( @xmath49 , @xmath11 ) , couple only to right handed electrons and left handed positrons . even for unpolarized beams",
    "the reach covers large areas of the @xmath50 plane for masses up to 200  gev . with increasing beam polarizations",
    "the sm background is suppressed and the signal enhanced , resulting in a large increase of accessible values down to @xmath51 .",

    "as pointed out in section  [ sec:2 ] the shape of the photon distribution at the threshold provides information on the dominant partial wave of the production process .",
    "the energy distribution of isr photons from the sm background and the wimp production can be fitted with the wimp cross section of formula  [ eq : sigma ] , leaving the wimp mass and the partial wave @xmath9 as free parameters in the fit . for @xmath57  fb@xmath35 ( @xmath46 )",

    "although the luminosity is low compared with the ilc design , the s - wave production can be excluded on 3@xmath39 level , due to the assumed wimp couplings and beam polarization .",
    "the simultaneous mass fit performs significantly worse than the dedicated template fit of the previous section .",
    "since the mass can be determined independently from @xmath9 , a constraint could be imposed on it in the simultaneous fit .",
    "the expected improvement on the @xmath9 measurement has to be quantified .",
    "the study presented here shows that there is a good chance of a model independent detection of wimps at the ilc .",

    "both the detection sensitivity and the mass resolution is enhanced when polarized beams are assumed .",
