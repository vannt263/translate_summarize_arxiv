    "the question of non - local quantum correlations versus local realism , first raised in the famous epr paper @xcite , has held the interest of the physics community since .",
    "j. s. bell @xcite showed that the predictions of quantum mechanics are incompatible with any model based on local realism . the pioneering experimental work of a. aspect",
    "_ @xcite and others @xcite supports the predictions of quantum mechanics and contradicts local realism : bell inequalities applicable to the various experimental arrangements have been shown to be violated .",
    "it should be mentioned that some aspects of the experimental setups have been criticized and questioned @xcite .",
    "problems of experimental bias or enhancement of particular polarization states by detection systems were experimentally checked by t. haji - hassan _",
    "_ @xcite and found absent . and more recently kwiat _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have proposed and described an experimental arrangement that overcomes shortcomings of previous experiments .",
    "while experiments are still open to criticism , it is generally accepted that local realism is untenable . in this letter",
    "we assume that in nature there exist non - local correlations , as predicted by quantum mechanics , and we address the following question : can an experimenter _ non - locally tamper _ with non - local correlations , without violating relativistic causality ?    quantum mechanics predicts non - local correlations ; however , it does not provide an  explanation \" about what creates them .",
    "several theoretical models go beyond quantum mechanics and propose to explain the phenomenon of non - local correlations via a superluminal `` communication link '' @xcite .",
    "if one accepts the possibility of a communication link , then a natural next step would be to probe whether it is possible to tamper with this link and _ jam _ the superluminal communication @xcite .",
    "up to now , the possibility of jamming non - local correlations has not received due consideration , perhaps because of a tacit assumption that such tampering necessarily violates relativistic causality .",
    "( the expression _",
    "relativistic causality _ is used here to denote the principle that information can not be transferred at speeds exceeding the speed of light . ) in this letter we show that jamming of non - local correlations can be consistent with relativistic causality .",
    "our results are independent of the model used to describe how the non - local quantum correlations arise , that is , the nature of the superluminal communication link , and they apply to any jamming mechanism .",
    "jamming might take many forms .",
    "the following discussion does not discuss a mechanism for jamming ; rather , it defines the constraints that any jamming mechanism must obey in order to be consistent with relativistic causality . in order to derive and illustrate the constraints ,",
    "it is convenient to consider a particular experimental arrangement which can be subjected to jamming @xcite .",
    "we will consider an epr - bohm experimental arrangement to study pairs of spin-@xmath0 particles entangled in a singlet state @xcite .",
    "spacelike separated spin measurements on these pairs allow a test of the bell inequalities .",
    "suppose that two experimenters , alice and bob , perform the spin measurements .",
    "one particle of each entangled pair arrives at alice s analyzing station and the other particle arrives at bob s .",
    "when alice and bob get together and combine the results of their measurements , they will find violations of the bell inequalities , as predicted by quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "we now introduce a third experimenter , jim , the jammer , who has access to a jamming device which he can activate , at will , and tamper with the communication link between each entangled pair of particles .",
    "his action is spacelike separated from the measurements of alice or bob or from both of them .",
    "jamming acts at a distance to modify the correlations between the particles ; it disturbs the conditions which make possible the phenomenon of non - local quantum correlations .",
    "therefore , the correlations measured jointly by alice and bob will not agree with the predictions of quantum mechanics .",
    "jamming is truly non - local and can not be carried out within the framework of quantum mechanics .",
    "for example , consider three systems , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , in a quantum state @xmath4 .",
    "let experimenters near @xmath1 and @xmath2 measure @xmath5 and @xmath6 , with eigenstates denoted by @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the only freedom available to an experimenter near @xmath3 is the choice of what local operator @xmath9 to measure .",
    "but the probabilities @xmath10 for outcomes @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath13 are _ independent _ of the choice of operator @xmath9 .",
    "thus no measurement on @xmath3 can affect the results of the measurements performed on @xmath1 and @xmath2 , even if the three systems have interacted in the past @xcite .    in general",
    ", jamming would allow jim to send superluminal signals",
    ". the constraints that must be satisfied in order to insure that jim can not send superluminal signals are embodied in two conditions .",
    "the first condition , the _ unary condition _ , a necessary but not sufficient condition , requires that jim not be able to send signals to alice or bob _ separately_. in effect this condition demands that alice and bob , separately , measure zero average spin along any axis .",
    "explicitly , let @xmath14 and @xmath15 tally the number of spin - up and spin - down results , respectively , found by alice for a given axis . for the same axis ,",
    "let @xmath16 tally , in the absence of jamming , the joint results of alice and bob .",
    "the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote , respectively , the results ( @xmath19 or @xmath20 ) of the polarization measurements carried out by alice and bob .",
    "let @xmath21 tally , in the presence of jamming , the corresponding polarization measurements carried out by alice and bob .",
    "the unary condition imposes the following relations between @xmath16 and @xmath21 : @xmath22 a similar set of relations holds for the results @xmath23 and @xmath24 found by bob . hence regardless of",
    "whether jim has activated the jamming device , alice and bob will find that the average spin projection along any axis tends to zero , and jim can not send superluminal signals , separately , to either alice or bob .",
    "the unary condition allows a range of possibilities for the jammed correlations : from correlations which are only slightly different from those predicted by quantum mechanics , down to completely random correlations .",
    "in particular , the unary condition allows conservation of angular momentum , _ i.e. _ perfect anticorrelation of spin components along any parallel axes .",
    "as stated in the previous section , the unary condition is a necessary but not sufficient condition . for jamming to respect relativistic causality",
    ", we must also restrict the relationships in space and time among the three events @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 generated , respectively , by alice , bob and jim .",
    "1 shows the geometry of three different configurations of an epr - bohm experimental setup along with the corresponding minkowski diagrams of the events @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 . in the configuration shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) , jamming is _ not _ permitted . here",
    "alice and bob are in close proximity while jim is far away .",
    "if jamming were permitted , alice and bob could immediately after jim activates the jamming device  measure the spin projections of their respective particles and combine their results to determine the spin correlations .",
    "they would find spin correlations differing from the predictions of quantum mechanics and infer that jim activated the jamming device .",
    "the corresponding minkowski diagram , fig .",
    "1(b ) , shows that the future light cones of @xmath25 and @xmath26 overlap , in part , outside the future light cone of @xmath27 . a light signal originating at @xmath27",
    "can not reach this overlap region of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where alice and bob can combine their results .",
    "were jamming possible here , it would violate relativistic causality .",
    "1(c ) shows a configuration that would also permit superluminal signalling : jim obtains the results of alice s measurements prior to deciding whether to activate the jamming device .",
    "bob is far from both alice and jim .",
    "the corresponding minkowski diagram , fig .",
    "1(d ) , shows that @xmath25 precedes @xmath27 by a timelike interval and both @xmath25 and @xmath27 are spacelike separated from @xmath26 . since jim has access to alice s results",
    ", he can send a superluminal signal to bob by _ selectively _ jamming : for instance , suppose jim activates the jamming device only when alice obtains the value @xmath28 for the projection of the spin of a particle .",
    "bob will , then , find that the average spin component along a given axis does _ not _ tend to zero .",
    "the preceding can be demonstrated by comparing the results of the spin measurements @xmath23 and @xmath29 , carried out by bob in the absence of jamming , eqs .",
    "( 3 ) , and in the presence of selective jamming , eqs . ( 4 ) .",
    "the notation previously defined is used in eqs .",
    "( 3 - 4 ) .",
    "@xmath30    @xmath31    hence the results obtained by bob in the presence of selective jamming will be different from those obtained in the absence of jamming unless @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "however , the latter requirements imply that jamming , in this configuration , can not have any discernible effect , i.e. jamming in this configuration is impossible .    to eliminate configurations which allow violations of relativistic causality , as shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) to fig .",
    "1(d ) , we further restrict jamming by imposing a second condition , the _ binary condition_. the binary condition , which is manifestly covariant , demands that the overlap of the future light cones of @xmath25 and @xmath26 lie entirely within the future light cone of @xmath27 and therefore a light signal emanating from @xmath27 can reach the overlap region . the configuration shown in fig . 1(a ) and 1(b ) , which allows an overlap of the future light cones of @xmath25 and @xmath26 outside of the future light cone of @xmath27 , is therefore forbidden .",
    "the configuration shown in fig 1(c ) and 1(d ) , a configuration for selective jamming , violates the unary condition and it is also disallowed by the    [ fig : hyp ]    binary condition . a configuration which satisfies the binary condition",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "1(e ) and 1(f ) . the constraints to which a jamming configuration must conform , in order not to violate relativistic causality , are embodied in the unary and binary conditions .",
    "these conditions are manifestly lorentz invariant .",
    "however , the time sequence of the events @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 is not .",
    "a time sequence @xmath25 , @xmath27 and @xmath26 in one lorentz frame may transform into @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath25 in another lorentz frame . hence while one observer will claim that alice completed her measurements before jim activated his jamming mechanism and thus jim affected only the results of bob s measurements",
    ", another observer will claim that bob carried out his measurements first and jim affected only alice s results .",
    "similar situations are encountered in quantum mechanics where different observers in different lorentz frames will give conflicting interpretations of the same set of events .",
    "for example , with respect to an entangled pair of particles in an epr - bohm experiment , the question of which observer caused the collapse of the entangled state has no lorentz - invariant answer @xcite .",
    "if jamming is possible then one must accept the possibility of reversal of the _ cause - effect _ sequence @xcite ; however , the allowed configuration which satisfies the _ unary _ and _ binary _ conditions does not lead to contradictory causal loops , i.e. no _ effect _ can send a signal to its _",
    "cause_. indeed , consider one jammer , @xmath34 , who acts on the correlations between two spacelike separated events , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "we first recall that the unary condition precludes signalling to @xmath25 and @xmath26 , separately , by @xmath27 ; therefore , only the combined results of the measurements of @xmath25 and @xmath26 can reveal whether @xmath34 activated a jamming mechanism . in order to complete a contradictory casual loop",
    "one must gather the results of the measurements of @xmath25 and @xmath26 into the past light cone of @xmath27 and then send a signal to @xmath27 , the _ cause_.",
    "but the binary condition requires that the overlap of the future light cones of @xmath25 and @xmath26 be completely contained in the future light cone of @xmath27 , so the only place where information from @xmath25 and @xmath26 can be put together by means of ordinary signals is the future of @xmath27 .",
    "one might suppose that other jammers , using their non - local action , could somehow transmit the information from @xmath25 and @xmath26 into the past light - cone of @xmath27 .",
    "such a scheme would require at least two more jammers .",
    "since these jammers must have access to the results of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , we place @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( generated by @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) at timelight separations , respectively , from @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "events @xmath25 and @xmath26 are spacelike separated from each other and from @xmath27 , so @xmath35 and @xmath36 will either be spacelike separated from @xmath27 or in its future light cone .",
    "the cases of @xmath37 and @xmath38 are similar , so we discuss only @xmath37 ; however , the conclusions reached apply equally to @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the jammer , @xmath37 , can communicate the results of @xmath25 by jamming or not jamming the non - local correlations between pairs of entangled particles measured at events @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "notice that in order to communicate the result of a single measurement done at @xmath25 , @xmath37 must jam ( or not jam ) an ensemble of epr pairs .",
    "the result of a single measurement carried out at @xmath25 is recovered from the correlations determined from the combined measurements done at @xmath39 and @xmath40 .    for the jammer @xmath37 to gather the information at @xmath25 into the past light cone of @xmath27",
    "requires that both @xmath39 and @xmath40 lie in the past light cone of @xmath27 , i.e. @xmath27 lies in the overlap of the future light cones of @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "this requirement , however , is incompatible with the binary condition when applied to the triplet of events , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath35 , which requires that the overlap of @xmath39 and @xmath40 be contained within the future light cone of @xmath35 .",
    "this , in turn , implies that @xmath27 will lie in the future light cone of @xmath35 , contradicting the assumption that @xmath35 is either spacelike separated from @xmath27 or in @xmath27 s future light cone .",
    "consequently , at least one event @xmath39 or @xmath40 must be spacelike separated from @xmath27",
    ". therefore the introduction of @xmath37 does not help to gather the results of @xmath25 into the past light cone of @xmath27 .",
    "then , by induction , we find that no scheme to close a contradictory causal loop , by introducing any number of jammers , can succeed .",
    "in quantum mechanics non - local correlations are well established ; however , these correlations can not be used to send superluminal signals . in this letter",
    "we have raised the question of whether a form of non - locality beyond quantum mechanics ",
    "non - local tampering with quantum correlations  could also respect relativistic causality .",
    "we find that jamming configurations which obey two conditions  the _ unary _ condition , which forbids superluminal signalling to either of two experimenters , and the _ binary _ condition , which restricts the space - time configuration of the two experimenters and the jammer  respect relativistic causality .",
    "for these configurations , the cause - effect sequence might not be preserved in all lorentz frames ; however , they do not lead to contradictory causal loops .",
    "hence , we find that a stronger form of non - locality than that arising in quantum mechanics  action at a distance rather than non - local correlations  is consistent with relativistic causality .",
    "@xcite    the results presented in this letter are independent of the model used to describe the nature of the non - local correlations and apply to any jamming mechanism . experimental studies , to date , have not tested the possibility of jamming .",
    "we suggest that current and projected epr - bohm experiments test the possibility of jamming in configurations consistent with the constraints derived in this letter .",
    "the constraints on the jamming configuration , however , because of their generality , do not themselves suggest a preferred mechanism for carrying out the jamming procedure ."
