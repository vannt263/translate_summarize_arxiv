    "the results have been confirmed with intermediate-@xmath0 data , showing a 14@xmath2 increase in the widths with activity @xcite .",
    "the authors also analyzed changes in the mode amplitudes , power , and energy - supply rate from solar minimum to maximum and concluded that the variations probably arise from an increase of the damping only , since the net forcing of the modes remains constant .",
    "some of the authors noted that , even if no significant changes in global _ p_-mode excitation are evident , it may possibly change locally .",
    "possible mechanisms , in addition to a continuous turbulent source of excitation , are transient phenomena such as flares @xcite and cmes @xcite .    one potential source of damping of the acoustic waves is magnetic activity that is present on the solar surface .",

    "black contours denote active - region concentrations . ]",
    "we characterize the activity level on the analyzed days by computing a magnetic activity index ( mai ) .",
    "the 1@xmath17 noise level in a single mdi magnetogram is about 20 g @xcite . to reliably compute mai we first set all unsigned flux less than 2.5@xmath18 g to zero and correct images for outliers using a technique similar to",
    "that described in @xcite .",
    "we compute mai by summing the absolute values of the magnetic flux inside the analyzed areas and normalizing the sum by the total number of pixels in the areas instead of the number of nonzero pixels .",
    "we also compute mai using nso / kitt peak magnetograms ( kpm ) for comparison .",
    "the 1@xmath17 noise level of kpm data is about 5 g @xcite .",
    "similarly , we set all unsigned flux less than 2.5@xmath19 g to zero .",
    "then we multiply the kpm images by 1.7 to correct for the difference in scale as mdi shows a larger magnetic flux than kpm .",
    "the computed mais are shown in table 1 .",
    "the mdi magnetograms for 24 may 1996 and kpm data for the two days in 2003 are absent .",
    "the data analysis and cross - correlation function computation procedure is similar to that used in @xcite and briefly described as follows :    .unsigned magnetic field ( in gauss ) averaged over the whole area including active regions and the quiet area ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ , > , < , > , < , > , < , > , < \" , ]     the lifetimes of solar _ p _ modes computed in the area including active regions are shown in figure 2 .",
    "it is seen that the lifetime decreases as activity increases.the results are in agreement with all previous studies of the _ p_-mode lifetimes mentioned earlier .",
    "the percentage of the lifetime decrease for all analyzed days relative to the days in 1996 is listed in table 2 .",
    "the maximal lifetime variations are between solar minimum in 1996 and maximum in 2000 ; the relative variation averaged over all @xmath0 values and frequencies is about 13@xmath2 .",
    "the lifetimes in 2003 are closer to the lifetimes in 2000 , and the lifetimes in 1998 are closer to those in 1996 .",
    "the lifetime variations relative to 1996 are about 7@xmath2 in 1998 and about 10@xmath2 in 2003 .",
    "as seen in table 1 , the activity level was higher on the analyzed days in 2003 than in 1998 .",
    "the lifetimes computed in the quiet area are presented in figure 3 . after excluding active regions from the analysis",
    ", the lifetimes decrease with solar activity , although the decrease is smaller . on average ,",
    "relative to 1996 , the decrease in the lifetime is about 4@xmath2 in 1998 , 10@xmath2 in 2000 , and 8@xmath2 in 2003 .",
    "the daily variations of the lifetime in 1996 are within the uncertainties of the measurements .",
    "thus , excluding high magnetic activity regions increases the measured lifetime . from the difference between lifetimes and the magnetic field strength of the quiet area and the area including active regions , and also from the distribution of the active features on the solar disk on the analyzed days ( see figure 1 ) , we speculate that acoustic waves are affected more by large active regions as seen at solar maximum , and less by small sunspots with strong magnetic field .",
    "this is likely because the wavelengths of the acoustic waves are typically larger than the smaller sunspots and better matched with the large active regions .",
    "the lifetime computed in the quiet area still shows variations with activity cycle .",
    "what could cause the variations in the quiet area where there are no large - scale magnetic field concentrations ?",
    "one explanation could be that the convective properties change with solar cycle . as discussed in the introduction , houdek _ et al . _",
    "( 2001 ) found that damping of _ p _ modes increases as horizontal size of convective eddies decreases .",
    "it has been reported by some authors @xcite that the horizontal scale of the solar granules decreases from solar minimum to maximum , which perhaps indicates that the horizontal size of the convective eddies does indeed decrease .",
    "( 2008 ) reported that supergranular cells are smaller at solar maximum .",
    "however , other studies arrive at the contradictory conclusion that granular size increases with activity @xcite .    solar - cycle variation of the lifetime in the quiet area caused by purely structural perturbations in the convection zone should result in lifetime variations with no correlation with magnetic field strength . to test this",
    "we computed the average lifetime for each wave packet over the four epochs and normalized each of the lifetimes by the average .",
    "then we plot the normalized lifetimes of all wave packets analyzed _ versus _ mai computed in the area including active regions and the quiet area in figure 4 .",
    "the lifetimes obviously anticorrelate with mai for the area including active regions . in the quiet area",
    "we also see an inverse correlation of the lifetimes with mai .",
    "this suggests that the magnetic field somehow plays a role in the lifetime variation of _ p _ modes in the quiet sun .",
    "future work will involve more statistics to confirm the conclusions .",
    "all of the analyzed quiet regions have different levels of magnetic field ( see table 1 ) .",
    "some isolated pixels in the quiet regions have magnetic fields as strong as @xmath20500 g , which are the strong - field component of the network field at the supergranular boundaries @xcite .",
    "thus , the elements of heightened magnetic activity in the quiet regions could cause the residual lifetime variations in the quiet area .",
    "the mais of the analyzed quiet areas also show solar - cycle variations .",
    "one can clearly see the increase in mai from table 1 ( plotted in figure 5 ) corresponding to the days at solar maximum for both the area with active regions and the quiet area .",
    "most authors who analyzed solar - cycle variations of the irradiance and photospheric magnetic field reported little overall solar - cycle variations in the quiet - sun network elements arising from decaying active regions , and no variations in the intranetwork field @xcite .",
    "( 2007 ) reported solar - cycle related variations of the granulation contrast at the solar surface connected to the temperature differences between granules and intergranular lanes .",
    "the contrast variations may be due to changes in the physical structure under the surface or a varying amount of magnetic flux in the intergranular lanes .    the recently discovered horizontal magnetic field in quiet regions in the solar photosphere",
    "@xcite might also affect the propagation of the acoustic waves in the quiet sun in a way different from that of the vertical component of the magnetic field .",
    "as the authors speculate , the possible driving mechanism for the horizontal field is granular and supergranular convection and transformation of the field lines in response to the evolving flux distribution in the network and intranetwork field in the quiet sun .    in future work , we will analyze a large number of quiet areas to confirm temporal variations of the lifetimes of high-@xmath0 acoustic waves found in this work .",
    "we will also study variability of the apparent power of the acoustic modes in an area including active regions and a quiet area in different phases of the solar cycle .",
