    "the study of formalized provability can be traced back to the seminal 1931 paper by kurt gdel @xcite , where he first showed how any mathematical theory that is able to describe the arithmetic of natural numbers , such as peano arithmetic ( pa ) , also possesses the expressive power to reason about provability within said theory .",
    "for this , he first noted that sentences _ about _ numbers can be encoded using numbers themselves .",
    "gdel then showed that we can define in the language of arithmetic a formula @xmath16 that holds true if , and only if , @xmath17 encodes a formula that is provable in the theory .",
    "he also noted that many statements about provability may be captured in the language @xmath18 of modal logic .",
    "formulae in @xmath18 are built from a countable set of propositional variables @xmath19 by applying boolean connectives and the operator @xmath20 , together with its dual @xmath21 .",
    "the provability logic @xmath0 has as axioms the schemata @xmath22 and the inference rules _ modus ponens _ and _ necessitation _ :",
    "@xmath23 .",
    "the intended interpretation for provability logic is to read @xmath24 as `` @xmath25 is provable in @xmath26 '' for some formal theory @xmath26 .",
    "however , other interpretations for @xmath0 are possible . as was proved by k. segerberg @xcite , @xmath0 is complete with respect to its kripke semantics , albeit not _ strongly _ complete .",
    "l. esakia @xcite showed that @xmath0 is also complete with respect to its topological interpretation , and indeed it is strongly complete .",
    "m. abashidze @xcite and a. blass @xcite improved esakia s theorem by showing that @xmath0 is also complete with respect to a single space ; namely , an ordinal number with what is known as the _ order topology_. it follows from the results of l. beklemishev and d. gabelaia @xcite and the second author @xcite that @xmath0 is also complete for a large collection of spaces introduced by t. icard @xcite and some of its generalizations @xcite .",
    "these topologies find natural interpretations in the construction of models of the polymodal logics @xmath27 with @xmath28 modalities , although technical difficulties have stopped these results from being extended to uncountable @xmath28 .",
    "this work partially solves these issues .",
    "our goal is to show how one can start with any topological space @xmath29 that validates the axioms of @xmath0 and modify it slightly so as to obtain a class of spaces of the form @xmath30 with @xmath7 an ordinal , such that @xmath0 is strongly complete with respect to @xmath31 for each @xmath32 , where @xmath28 depends on @xmath11 ( although it may well be arbitrarily large ) .",
    "we call the spaces @xmath31 thus obtained _ generalized icard spaces . _",
    "we expect the present work to be of interest , as strong completeness of provability logic for single spaces is novel , and generalized icard spaces give a wide class of spaces which provide natural and easily described topological models for @xmath0 .",
    "the article consists of six main sections . in section",
    "[ secord ] , we review some facts about ordinal arithmetic and transfinite iterations of normal and initial functions .",
    "section [ sectopo ] reviews the topological semantics of modal logic . in section [ secrel ]",
    ", we introduce a class of models for provability logic called _ @xmath33-bouquets _ and prove the strong completeness of @xmath0 with respect to this class . in section [ secic ] , we introduce _ generalized icard spaces _ and our main result , strong completeness of @xmath0 , is proved in section [ secgl ] .",
    "we then finish with some concluding remarks .",
    "we will be dealing extensively with ordinal numbers and so we assume knowledge of elementary ordinal arithmetic , although we will review some basic facts , as well as some operations that will be of great importance . for a thorough review ,",
    "we refer the reader to , for example , @xcite .",

    ", the reader might want to check that the function @xmath82 coincides with the epsilon function .",
    "of course , lemma [ recexp].[rechypiv ] is not the only way to compute @xmath83 .",
    "two useful alternatives are given as follows :    [ explimits ] let @xmath42 be an ordinal , @xmath7 be an additively indecomposable limit , and @xmath53 be a nonzero - valued function on @xmath58 .",

    "since @xmath95 is additively indecomposable , we have that @xmath96 whence @xmath97 since @xmath98 was arbitrary , the claim follows .    for the second claim we have that , if @xmath89 , then @xmath99 and since @xmath100 it follows that @xmath101 .",

    "moreover , @xmath43 belongs to @xmath111 , since the function @xmath112 is normal and thus @xmath111 is closed .",

    "we next turn our attention to _ hyperlogarithms , _ which are iterations of _ initial , _ rather than normal , functions .    a function @xmath53 on the ordinals",
