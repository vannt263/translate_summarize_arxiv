    "it seems , particularly after the introduction of the inflationary paradigm ( ) , that the isotropic and homogeneous friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmological models are best suited for the description of the global structure and the evolution of the universe .",
    "however , a similar statement is not necessarily true when cosmologically moderate scales are thought of .",
    "there exists direct observational evidence in favour of the large scale isotropy of the observed universe , namely , the cobe data confirming a high degree of isotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) (; ) .",
    "however , the observational basis for the other standard assumption made in the frw cosmology , the homogeneity , is weaker",
    ". there exists observational evidence in favour of larger and larger structures ( e.g. ; ) .",
    "we think that there exists sufficient observational evidence ( discussed later in this paper ) to support a conjecture that we may live in a relatively large underdense region embedded in a globally frw universe .",
    "exploring observational properties of such a model is the aim of the present paper .",
    "the simple model presented in this paper is restricted by the two physical demands we impose on it .",
    "firstly , to be consistent with the cmbr isotropy it has to be spherically symmetric .",
    "secondly , the model should be very similar to an frw one at the beginning of the expansion , but become observably different at later times . in this manner",
    ", we could retain the accomplishments of the frw cosmology in dealing with early epochs , while gaining new freedom in modelling the more recent universe .",
    "the work on modelling voids of the lematre - tolman - bondi type in the expanding frw universe has been extensive .",
    "main results and references will be briefly discussed later .",
    "( an excellent review of the inhomogeneous cosmology exists : . ) nevertheless , the observable consequences of such a model have seldom been studied ( e.g. ; ) .    in the following section ,",
    "we briefly describe the ltb model .",
    "section [ void ] consists of a concise review of the main results in modelling ltb voids , a discussion of the observational background and the simple model of a local void presented here .",
    "the description of our results of numerical calculations is contained in section [ resnum ] the closing section contains a discussion and conclusions .    throughout this paper",
    "we use units in which @xmath1 , unless stated otherwise . moreover",
    ", we choose the cosmological constant @xmath2 .",
    "first , for the sake of notational clarity , let us recall the frw line element : @xmath3,\\ ] ] with @xmath4 .    now , let us consider a lematre - tolman ",
    "bondi ( , ) model for a spherically symmetric inhomogeneous universe filled with dust .",
    "the line element in comoving coordinates can be written as : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an arbitrary function of @xmath7 only , and the field equations demand that @xmath8 satisfies : @xmath9 with @xmath10 being an arbitrary function of class @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we have three distinct solutions depending on whether @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and they correspond to elliptic ( closed ) , parabolic ( flat ) and hyperbolic ( open ) cases , respectively .",
    "the proper density can be expressed as : @xmath17    whatever the curvature , the total mass within comoving radius @xmath7 is : @xmath18 so that @xmath19 also for @xmath20 everywhere we have @xmath21 and @xmath22 so that in the non - singular part of the model @xmath23 except for @xmath24 and @xmath25 is non - negative and monotonically increasing for @xmath26 .",

    "de sitter case .    for the closed and open cases the parametric solutions for the rate of expansion can be written as ( ):    [ parneg ] @xmath36 , \\quad     f^{2}<1 , \\ ] ] @xmath37    , \\quad f^{2}<1 , \\ ] ]    and    [ parpos ] @xmath38 , \\quad    f^{2}>1 , \\ ] ] @xmath39    , \\quad f^{2}>1 , \\ ] ]    with @xmath30 being again a function of integration of class @xmath11 and @xmath40 the parameter .",
    "the flat case ( @xmath28 ) has been extensively studied elsewhere ( ) .",
    "the model depends on one arbitrary function @xmath41 and could be specified by assuming the density on some space - like hypersurface , say @xmath42 .",
    "however , specifying the density on the past light cone of the observer is more appropriate .",
    "the cases of interest to us , ( [ parneg ] ) and ( [ parpos ] ) , correspond to closed and open models , respectively .    before we proceed ( in the next section ) to discuss the observational grounds for modelling a local void , we need to amplify the discussion of the ltb model by introducing basic features of the propagation of light",
    ". the high degree of isotropy of the microwave background forces us to the conclusion that we must be located close to the spatial centre of the local ltb void . in our discussion , for the sake of simplicity , we place an observer at the centre ( @xmath43 ) .    the luminosity distance between an observer at the origin of our coordinate system ( @xmath44 ) and the source at ( @xmath45 ) is ( ): @xmath46}^2,\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the absolute luminosity of the source",
    "( the energy emitted per unit time in the source s rest frame ) , @xmath48 is the measured flux ( the energy per unit time per unit area as measured by the observer ) and @xmath49 is the redshift ( blueshift ) for a light ray emitted at ( @xmath50 ) and observed at ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the light ray travelling inwards to the centre satisfies : @xmath51 and thus @xmath52 where the sign is determined by the fact that the light ray travels along the _ past _ light cone ( i.e. if @xmath53 , then @xmath54 ) .    without getting into a detailed discussion , which can be found in , or ,",
    "let us state that if the equation of the light ray travelling along the light cone is : @xmath55 using ( [ zero ] ) , we get the equation of a ray along the path : @xmath56 , \\ ] ] where @xmath57 =    { \\left .",

    "thus we have two contributions to the redshift",
    ". the cosmological redshift due to expansion , described by the first term with @xmath63 , and the gravitational shift due to the difference between the potential energy per unit mass at the source and at the observer .",
    "obviously , in the homogeneous case ( @xmath64 ) there is no gravitational shift .",
    "if we restrict ourselves to spatial scales that have been well probed observationally , i.e. up to a few hundred mpc , the most striking feature of the luminous matter distribution is the existence of large voids surrounded by sheet - like structures containing galaxies ( e.g. ) .",
    "these surveys ( see also ) give a typical size of the voids of the order 5060 @xmath65 mpc .",
    "there has also been some evidence ( ) with less certainty for the existence of larger underdense regions with characteristic sizes of about 130 @xmath65 mpc .",
    "also , dynamical estimates of the frw density parameter @xmath66 give very different results on different scales .",
    "the observations of galactic halos on scales less than about 10 to 30 mpc typically give ( see e.g. ) @xmath67 . on the other hand , smoothing the observations over larger scales ( @xmath68 , say @xmath69 ) indicates ( e.g. ) the existence of a less clustered component with a contribution exceeding 0.2 , and perhaps as high as @xmath70 .    at the same time",
    ", the large scale galaxy surveys ( some of the recent literature is given in ) firmly indicate a considerable excess in the number  magnitude counts for faint galaxies relative to predictions of homogeneous , `` no - evolution '' models",
    ". this excess could be the result of a non - standard galactic evolution or could be caused by rather exotic frw cosmology ( i.e. the deceleration parameter @xmath71 or a non - zero cosmological constant @xmath72 ) .",
    "however , it can also be treated as an observational indication of a very large ( on the scale of the redshift @xmath73 ) void . in the following ,",
    "we choose this latter option in interpreting the faint galaxies number counts and model the density distribution of a local void accordingly .",
    "( a somewhat similar model of a gaussian void as a function of the comoving coordinate can be found in . )",
    "we study a void with the central density equal to that of an frw model with the density parameter @xmath74 , asymptotically approaching the frw model with @xmath75 .",
    "since cosmological observations are done by detecting some form of electromagnetic radiation , the mapping obtained from them describes the density along the light cone .",
    "we describe the density distribution , as a function of the redshift @xmath76 , by : @xmath77 the choice of a rational function @xmath78 ( as opposed to , say , a gaussian distribution ) assures that the differential equations that we solve numerically ( already quite complex ) are not unnecessarily complicated further . in the numerical calculations presented in the next section we used the values @xmath79 , @xmath80 .",
    "the two density distributions presented there are parametrized by ( a ) @xmath81 and ( b ) @xmath82 , and are depicted in figure [ f1 ] .    in the following figures",
    "the results obtained for the ( steeper ) distribution ( a ) will be represented by dashed lines , while the results for the density distribution ( b ) will always be given as solid lines . also , since we study here the observations of the luminous matter , we present our results in the range of up to @xmath83 .",
    "( an observation of an object with a redshift in excess of this value would be hard to reconcile with standard frw cosmology . )",
    "the final question we wish to address in this section is that of shell crossing in the ltb models . the problem has been extensively studied ( for a detailed review and a complete list of references see ) .",
    "as seen from ( [ linel ] ) and ( [ dens ] ) shell crossing can occur when @xmath84 for some @xmath85 .",
    "this , in general , may lead to @xmath86 and a shell crossing singularity .",
    "different shells @xmath87 collide and the comoving coordinates become inadmissible .",
    "the singularity can be avoided , if the functions @xmath88 and @xmath89 both have at @xmath85 zeros of the same order as @xmath90 has .",
    "this , however , is not the case in the present work ( we assume @xmath91 and @xmath92 ) .    in the simple model presented here",
    ", shell crossing does occur .",
    "the physical significance of this can be viewed from diametrically opposite positions .",
    "one extreme is to regard a shell crossing singularity as unphysical and try to exclude it by assuming special initial conditions , as was the strategy in the work of bonnor and chamorro (; ) .",
    "however , this leads to difficulties with adjusting the model to observational data . in short : either the average density of the void is not appreciably lower than the density of the background , or the matter in the void is much older than outside .",
    "the second approach , best represented by sato and collaborators ( see e.g. ) , is to treat the shell crossing singularity as a physical entity . in this approach ,",
    "shell crossings numerically modelled as surface layers of matter are interpreted as rims of the expanding voids and correspond to the aforementioned sheet - like structures surrounding observed voids .",
    "an observationally acceptable ltb void , with the density distribution similar to that depicted in figure [ f1 ] , is too deep to escape shell crossing and , at the same time , allow for the simultaneous big bang throughout the whole space . since we see the latter property as very important in order to be able to incorporate the accomplishments of the frw cosmology in dealing with epochs preceding the matter dominated era , we choose to accept shell crossing as a price .",
    "the more so , that as will be shown in the next section the distribution ( [ densdistr ] ) , even though chosen on purely observational grounds , leaves us with a bonus : the shell crossing happens in the distant future .",
    "this , in our opinion , indicates that the ltb void studied here is applicable to the matter dominated era .",
    "( the fact that the ltb model does not allow for pressure is not perilous from our point of view .",
    "after all , the universe has been matter dominated since @xmath93 .",
    "the model is applicable to this era and may be thought of as a continuation of an earlier very nearly frw model , provided its density contrast at the time of decoupling , @xmath94 , is @xmath95 . )",
    "in general , an ltb model depends on three arbitrary functions ( see section [ model ] ) , @xmath96 and @xmath89 . since @xmath25 can be interpreted as twice the effective gravitational mass within comoving radius @xmath7 ( ) , then , in accordance with the discussion following ( [ mass ] ) , assuming its form is equivalent to a coordinate choice . in our calculations we used @xmath97 .",
    "the second function , @xmath30 , sets the initial singularity hypersurface of the model .",
    "since we want the region of highest density in our model to be fully equivalent to the frw universe , we set @xmath98 , thereby assuming a universally simultaneous big bang . in doing so , we give up a very important feature of an ltb model : an extra ( with respect to frw ) degree of freedom that would allow the age of the universe to be position dependent .",
    "however , we study the following two cases ( both with the simultaneous big bang hypersurface ) : the universe whose age is equal to that of the frw critical ( @xmath99 ) case and the universe with the age equal to that of the frw @xmath100 one .",
    "the parametrization of the cases is , respectively , ( i ) @xmath101 and ( ii ) @xmath102 , where in both cases we set the time coordinate of constant time hypersurface `` now '' so that it is equal to the age of the universe @xmath103 in the frw model with @xmath75 .",
    "the third ( `` curvature '' ) function , @xmath89 , is an unknown to be solved for in our calculations .",
    "since we are modelling an underdense comoving void in an frw universe , we choose the ltb hyperbolic ( @xmath104 ) case .    in a manner similar to that employed in , we assume that since all cosmological observations are necessarily done by detecting some form of electromagnetic radiation , the solution should progress along the light cone . the final set of equations we solve consists of the equations ( [ lightcone ] ) , ( [ zred ] ) and the equation describing the ratio of the local density ( [ dens ] ) to the density of the frw universe through the relation ( [ densdistr ] ) taken along the past light cone : @xmath105}{\\rho_{frw}[t(r)]}=\\frac{3f^{\\prime}(r){[t(r)+\\beta_0]}^2 } { 8 r^{\\prime}[t(r),r ] r^{2}[t(r),r]}=\\omega_{v}[z(r)].\\ ] ]",
    "the final form of the equations is quite unwieldy and we do not present them here . since @xmath106 ( the time of emission @xmath107 of a light ray observed at @xmath24 at @xmath108 )",
    "is now given by ( [ parpost ] ) and @xmath109 is governed by ( [ zred ] ) , the functions to be solved for are @xmath110 and @xmath111 , where the parameter @xmath40 becomes the function of position .",
    "the initial conditions for the integration have to be set at @xmath112 , since the analytic expressions ( [ parpos ] ) are singular at @xmath24 , where @xmath113 ( we have a flat @xmath74 frw universe there ) .",
    "we assume that for the initial radius @xmath114 ( we use dimensionless radius and time in the calculations ) corresponding @xmath115 and @xmath116 are given by their standard frw values",
    ". then @xmath117 and @xmath118 can be obtained from ( [ parpost ] ) , ( [ lightcone ] ) and ( [ zred ] ) .",
    "once the equations have been numerically integrated ( in all cases the accuracy of our numerical procedure was @xmath119 or better ) we use ( [ parpost ] ) to obtain @xmath107 for a given @xmath120 .",
    "the luminosity distance @xmath121 corresponding to this event is obtained with the use of ( [ lumdis ] ) and @xmath122 ( useful in studying the cosmological time scale ) is given by the parametric relation @xmath123 $ ] .",
    "the results of our numerical calculations for @xmath109 , where @xmath7 is the dimensionless comoving radius used in the calculations are depicted in figure [ f2 ] .",
    "the coordinate distance has no direct physical relevance , but our units here are such that @xmath124 corresponds to @xmath125 mpc , where @xmath126 is the usual coefficient in the observationally determined value of the hubble constant : @xmath127 .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath109 is as intuitively expected . in the `` older '' case ( ii )",
    "the redshift @xmath76 asymptotically converges to the frw @xmath128 behaviour .",
    "the additional gravitational shift caused by the mass distribution of the void is apparent on the scales comparable to that of the void ( @xmath129 ) . on intermediate to large scales",
    "the effect of a cosmological expansion is predominant . in the `` younger '' case ( i )",
    ", @xmath109 after an excess over the frw relation due to the gravitational shift induced by the void asymptotically tends to a limit that could , in accordance with the frw interpretation , correspond to the universe with the density parameter in the range @xmath130 . in both instances ,",
    "the convergence to the frw relation is marginally faster for the cases with steeper density distributions .",
    "however , one should not forget that the comoving distance is _ not _ an observable , whereas the luminosity distance @xmath131 is . in principle , provided we know its absolute luminosity @xmath132 , we can establish the luminosity distance , defined by @xmath133 , by measuring the energy flux @xmath134 of an observed object ( for a discussion of usual caveats associated with so - called `` standard candles '' see e.g. ; ) .",
    "it is the @xmath135 relation that is observationally relevant .",
    "let us recall that the frw equivalent of ( [ lumdis ] ) is : @xmath136    before we probe the observable properties of the solution , let us investigate the temporal evolution of the void .",
    "in doing so we seek answers to two important questions .",
    "first , how soon in the further evolution of the void the formation of a shell crossing singularity occurs .",
    "if this happens in the distant enough future , then our model is applicable to a sufficiently long cosmological epoch to be considered physical .",
    "secondly , we want to verify that at early times the density contrast @xmath137 , where @xmath138 and @xmath139 are matter densities in the void and in the background , in accordance with our conjecture that the model be very similar to an frw one at the beginning of the expansion .",
    "in general , the earlier the formation time of the void , the faster the growth of the density contrast . also , the rate of growth is increased in the cases of higher initial contrasts .",
    "( see . a very thorough numerical study of the evolution of general relativistic voids , including the ltb ones , can also be found in . ) in the study presented here , however , we did not assume a density distribution on some hypersurface of constant time as initial condition .",
    "the observationally based density distributions of figure [ f1 ] were given as functions of the redshift @xmath76 and since we numerically integrated the equations along the light cone , we are not yet in the position to examine the time evolution of the spatial distribution of the matter density .",
    "however , equipped with the solution for @xmath89 we can use ( [ parpost ] ) to obtain the values of the parameter @xmath140 corresponding to a given hypersurface of constant time @xmath141 throughout the space .",
    "then , using ( [ dens ] ) we get the spatial matter density distributions for the time @xmath142 .",
    "the results ( numerical solution points ) of this calculation for the future and past evolution of the steeper void ( a ) in the `` younger '' case ( i ) are presented in figures [ f3 ] and [ f4 ] , respectively .",
    "the density distribution in this case evolves fastest and , as such , is the most representative in estimating the time scales involved .",
    "figure [ f3 ] shows that the void expands outward increasing its density contrast and forming a very steep ridge on its boundary .",
    "this ( in accordance with ; ) leads to the eventual formation of a thin dense shell and the shell crossing singularity . of interest to us , however , is the time scale of this process . since the shell crossing occurs for @xmath143 , where @xmath144 is the present age of the universe",
    ", we conclude that our model is applicable to a satisfactorily long cosmological epoch .    at the same time , figure [ f4 ] clearly indicates that our model satisfies the requirement of similarity to the frw one at early cosmological times . at @xmath145",
    "the matter density is approximately constant everywhere . for the case depicted in figure [ f4 ]",
    "the density contrast is @xmath146 for @xmath145 ( @xmath147 for @xmath148 ) . in all cases at @xmath149 we have @xmath150 .",
    "there is hardly a trace of the void s presence .",
    "the @xmath122 relations for the cases of different `` ages of the universe '' are presented in figures [ f5 ] and [ f6 ] .",
    "there is some divergence from the frw behaviour , but for early cosmological times the relations tend to their frw counterparts .",
    "this asymptotic behaviour is in accordance with our assumption of a simultaneous big bang , @xmath151 , and with our setting the age of the universe in each case to be equal to that of the corresponding frw case . in both ( i ) and ( ii ) cases objects with similar redshifts are younger than their frw counterparts ( i.e. @xmath152 , when @xmath153 ) , but not significantly .",
    "those objects have marginally more time to form and evolve than their frw counterparts .",
    "let us now explore the @xmath135 relations resulting from our model .",
    "any nonstandard cosmological model to be of interest must pass two tests when confronted with observations . to be considered realistic , it is of utmost importance that its predictions do not contradict the linearity of hubble s law @xmath154 , well established on small scales .",
    "at the same time , it should be sufficiently different from the standard ( frw ) models to allow for significant reinterpretation of observational results .",
    "let us now apply these two tests to our model .",
    "figure [ f7 ] shows that ( in all cases studied here ) on large scales the ltb `` hubble relation '' between the redshift @xmath76 and the luminosity distance @xmath131 is reminiscent of the frw relation for the universe with the density parameter in the range @xmath130 .    at the same time ,",
    "inspection of figure [ f8 ] shows that on small scales very nearly linear `` hubble diagrams '' are obtained for both types of ltb voids and both time scales .",
    "if we recall ( , a good overview can be found in  5 of ) that the hubble diagram , extended to @xmath155 , follows the hubble s law with the redshifts scatter ( assuming identical absolute magnitudes of observed galaxies ) of @xmath156 20 % around the theoretical prediction , then we can claim that the redshift  distance ( redshift  magnitude ) relations inferred from our model are within the observational bounds . also , inspection of figure [ f8 ] shows that on small scales observationally indistinguishable from linear `` hubble diagrams '' are obtained .",
    "however , a different value for the hubble parameter ( constant ) is inferred , if we insist on interpreting the results of cosmological observations through an frw model .    also for larger observed redshifts ( see e.g. the results of mccarthy s survey of the state of the measurements of the infrared hubble diagram for radio galaxies , out to @xmath157 , in  5 of ) our results are well within the observational scatter .",
    "moreover , when the measurements of the hubble diagram are extended to large scales an interesting feature emerges .",
    "the slope of the diagram at @xmath158 seems to be consistent with the linear hubble law .",
    "however , at @xmath159 a hint of curvature appears . in the standard frw interpretation , this is presumed to be the result of relativistic corrections to the redshift  distance relation and of the fact that the galaxies observed at high redshifts are seen as they were younger and very likely more luminous than the galaxies observed at low redshifts .",
    "the fact that the redshift is observed to increase with distance , at least roughly in accordance with hubble s law , for redshifts out to in excess of unity , is usually heralded as one of the major observational confirmations of standard frw cosmology .",
    "it would be interesting to see how the predictions of our model withstand the same observational test .",
    "figure [ f9 ] depicts the logarithmic redshift ",
    "luminosity distance relations for both ltb voids and both time scales . a survey of measurements ( adapted from ) is also included .",
    "the @xmath135 relations for the frw cases with @xmath160 and @xmath100 are presented for comparison .",
    "it is now apparent that the redshift ",
    "luminosity distance relations inferred from our model are in agreement with observations",
    ". for small redshifts , say up to @xmath0 , they are observationally indistinguishable from the frw results .",
    "for intermediate redshifts in the range , say , @xmath161 , where the gravitational shift contribution to the overall redshift causes the most manifest departure from the frw relations , our results remain well within the observational scatter . in the range @xmath159 , where the `` hint of curvature '' in the redshift  distance relation is observed , our results fit the observations better than the frw @xmath162 prediction .",
    "however , a still better fit is provided by the frw @xmath163 curve .    due to the possible ( e.g. evolutionary ) corrections to the redshift",
    " distance relation and the minute dissimilarities between frw and ltb relations no assertions as to the best fit to observations seem irrefutable .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth noticing that the model presented here supplies us with means to reinterpret the correlation between the theory and observational results ( perhaps improving agreement between the two ) .    as a final element of the discussion of observational properties of our model with a local ltb void ,",
    "let us concentrate on the hubble parameter ( constant ) measurement . in a spherically symmetric model we have two `` hubble parameters '' : @xmath164 for the local expansion rate in the radial direction and @xmath165 for expansion in the perpendicular direction .",
    "usual definitions give :    [ hubble ] @xmath166 @xmath167    where @xmath168 denotes the proper distance , i.e. @xmath169 and @xmath170 . due to the fact that there are both gravitational and expansion redshifts contributing to the total @xmath76 ,",
    "neither of the hubble parameters @xmath171 , @xmath172 is fully analogous to the frw s @xmath173 .",
    "the closest analogy exists for small separations of the source and the observer .",
    "let us notice that the integral in ( [ grco ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath174 and for small @xmath175 can be neglected when compared to the first term of ( [ grco ] ) .",
    "expanding the logarithms on both sides we see that light emitted at ( @xmath50 ) and observed at ( @xmath176 ) satisfies for small @xmath120 or small ( @xmath177 ) : @xmath178 where @xmath107 is @xmath179 from ( [ lightcone ] ) with the initial condition @xmath180 . using ( [ hubblep ] ) and ( [ lumdis ] ) we get for small @xmath120 : @xmath181 which is formally analogous to the frw result .",
    "two main differences are that our relation is _ local _ and that from cosmological observations ( on small scales ) we obtain the angular hubble parameter @xmath182 rather than @xmath173 .",
    "in general , if we lived in a local ltb void and the @xmath76 vs. @xmath131 relation differed from the frw one as described in this paper , but we were biased by our theoretical prejudice and interpreted cosmological observations through an frw model , we would expect the value of the hubble parameter to be position , or rather @xmath131 , dependent .    to explore this possibility",
    "let us recall that in frw cosmology the exact result for the hubble relation ( @xmath76 versus @xmath131 ) in the matter dominated universe is ( ): @xmath183,\\ ] ] where @xmath184 is the deceleration parameter .",
    "on cosmologically very small distances we measure the same value of @xmath185 independently of the model ( we call this value `` the local measurement '' ) .",
    "this stems from the fact that , due to our assumptions , very close to the centre ( @xmath186 ) the model is well approximated by the frw universe with @xmath187 . obviously , if the universe were locally ltb rather than frw , then the hubble parameter based on the observed ( ltb ) values of @xmath76 and @xmath131 , but inferred through an frw relation ( [ hubblefrw ] ) , would be position ( redshift ) dependent .",
    "the dependence of the hubble parameter @xmath188 ( in units of the @xmath185 value as measured locally ) on the redshift @xmath76 is shown in figure [ f10 ] .",
    "for the sake of the clarity of presentation , only the results for the `` younger '' case ( i ) are included in the figure .",
    "qualitatively , the `` older '' case ( ii ) exhibits the same behaviour .",
    "quantitatively , as seen from the @xmath76 vs. @xmath131 relations of figure [ f7 ] and ( [ hubblefrw ] ) , the `` observed '' values of the hubble parameter ( in the units of the local measurement ) for the case ( ii ) become increasingly smaller than those of the case ( i ) ( @xmath189 smaller for @xmath157 ) .",
    "the @xmath190 relation depicted in figure [ f10 ] strongly depends on the choice of the frw case the choice of the deceleration parameter @xmath191 in ( [ hubblefrw]) through which we interpret the observations .",
    "the main feature in the frw @xmath162 interpretation is a distinct monotonic correlation between @xmath188 and @xmath76 ( or @xmath131 ) .",
    "the values of the `` observed '' hubble constant decrease with the redshift @xmath76 asymptotically approaching the background limit .",
    "if we interpret the results within the frw @xmath192 framework , the `` observed '' values of the hubble constant first decrease with @xmath76 and then asymptotically increase to some background limit .",
    "( this asymptotic behaviour becomes clearly visible only for very large @xmath76 . )",
    "the position of the minimum in @xmath188 depends on the size of the ltb void .",
    "neither of these patterns is evident in the reported measurements of the hubble constant .",
    "however , one has to remember that the measurements of the hubble constant come inseparable from their own observational uncertainties ( estimates of the distance using a distance ladder , corrections for peculiar motion etc . ) .",
    "moreover , it is not the broader idea of a local ltb void embedded in a globally frw universe that fails here .",
    "a choice of density distributions @xmath193 more complex than ( [ densdistr ] ) could result in a better agreement with observations .",
    "we think that the variance in @xmath190 exhibited in figure [ f10 ] is a valuable feature of the model . the ratios of the highest to the lowest value of the `` observed '' @xmath188 within the range of redshifts of figure [ f10 ] are @xmath194 .",
    "at the same time , the values of @xmath185 reported to date span the range @xmath195 to @xmath196 ( with standard errors quoted frequently as @xmath197 or less ! ) .",
    "inhomogeneities similar to the ltb void presented here might provide an explanation for this .",
    "the ltb voids presented here decrease their density contrasts ( the depth of the void with respect to the frw background ) when evolved back in time . at early times",
    "they are almost homogenized : at @xmath198 we have @xmath199 everywhere .",
    "this corresponds to a universe which at the beginning is very similar to the frw one , but different at late stages .    in a model utilizing a local ltb void , while retaining the accomplishments of the frw cosmology in dealing with epochs preceding the matter dominated era , we can gain new freedom in modelling the more recent universe .",
    "we can solve the age of the universe problem by assuming @xmath200 , provide the excess power observed on scales of 510,000 km s@xmath201 in modelling structure formation ( see ) and provide an explanation for the wide range of reported values of the hubble constant .",
    "the use of a locally inhomogeneous model enriches the spectrum of available interpretations .",
    "the ultimate question to be addressed , however , is the agreement between predictions of the model and observations .",
    "as has been demonstrated by the results of the present work , the observationally based density distributions spanning the range of @xmath130 satisfy the observational tests .",
    "the agreement with observations is achieved both in the case of the model with the `` age of the universe '' equal to that of the critical ( @xmath99 ) frw one and the `` older '' case with @xmath202 equal to the frw @xmath128 value . theoretical prejudice ( as powerful as the inflationary paradigm )",
    "might favour the critical frw model .",
    "the authors thank n. kaiser , a. krasiski and s. j. lilly for discussions .",
    "this work was supported by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada .",
