    "the qcd vacuum is known to be one of the most complicated states entangled with perturbative and strong nonperturbative fluctuations . in particular , the condensates of the quarks and gluons reveal their non - perturbative aspect and character . the quark condensate is taken as an order parameter associated with spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking ( s@xmath5sb ) which is probably one of the most important quantities for low - energy hadronic phenomena .",

    "[ fig : re ] at @xmath200 @xmath198 they bring the leading order term down to almost @xmath201 . thus it makes no sense to calculate the susceptibility for larger values of @xmath193 .",
    "even this limited range given in fig .",
    "[ fig : re ] might be interesting for practitioners of lattice gauge qcd calculations .",
    "those calculations suffer generally under the fact that by technical reasons they can not be performed with current quark masses corresponding to the physical pion mass .",
    "usually they have to use @xmath202 . in order to obtain a physical observable one",
    "has to extrapolate from the @xmath193 used in the lattice calculation to @xmath203 .",
    "there exist different extrapolation techniques as e.g. linear extrapolation , extrapolation by chiral perturbation theory @xcite , finite range extrapolation  @xcite , extrapolation by suitable chiral models @xcite , etc .",

    "in the present work , we have investigated the magnetic susceptibility of the qcd vacuum , based on the low - energy effective qcd partition function from the instanton vacuum .",
    "we first have constructed the effective partition function in the presence of the external vector and tensor fields as well as of the current quark mass .",
    "we have made the effective action gauge - invariant at the outset .",
    "we also have considered the meson - loop corrections which are a part of the @xmath0 corrections . to be consistent ,",
    "we have taken into account the effects of the finite width of the instanton size distribution as well as the tensor terms of the quark - quark interactions , since they are also of order @xmath2 . however , both these effects turn out to be negligibly small .",
    "the meson - loop corrections contribute to the magnetic susceptibility @xmath7 negatively and their chiral - log terms almost cancel those of the leading - order contribution .",
    "they contribute to the magnetic susceptibility for the up and down quarks by around @xmath1 . as a result , assuming for the up quarks ( and identically for the down quarks ) @xmath204 we obtain the magnetic susceptibility @xmath205 .",
    "these results are comparable to the estimates of the vector dominance and of the qcd sum rule approaches  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that @xmath7 is almost a linearly decreasing function of the current quark mass @xmath25 or of @xmath193 . to know this might be useful for the chiral extrapolation of lattice data for the magnetic susceptibility of the qcd vacuum .",
