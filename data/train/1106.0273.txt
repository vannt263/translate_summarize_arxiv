    "investigating the space of all quadratic invariant laminations played a crucial role in @xcite .",
    "an important idea of thurston s was , as we see it , similar to one of the main ideas of dynamics as a whole - to suggest a tool ( _ laminations _ ) allowing one to model the dynamics under investigation on a topologically / combinatorially nice object ( in case of @xcite one models polynomial dynamics on the julia set by so - called _ topological polynomials _",
    ", generated by laminations ) .    according to thurston ,",

    "@xmath1 is a closed family of chords inside the open unit disk @xmath2 .",
    "these chords meet at most in a common endpoint and satisfy some dynamical conditions ; these chords are called _ leaves ( of the lamination ) _ and union of all leaves from @xmath1 united with @xmath0 is denoted by @xmath3 . a natural _ direct _ way to associate a lamination to a polynomial @xmath4 of degree @xmath5 with a locally connected",
    "julia set is as follows : ( 1 ) define an equivalence relation @xmath6 on @xmath0 by identifying angles if their external rays land at the same point ( observe that @xmath6 on @xmath0 is @xmath7-invariant ) ; ( 2 ) consider the edges of convex hulls of equivalence classes and declare them to be the _ leaves _ of the corresponding _ lamination _",
    "@xmath8 .    by @xcite",
    "more advanced methods allow one to associate a lamination to some polynomials with non - locally connected julia sets ( by declaring two angles equivalent if impressions of their external rays are non - disjoint and extending this relation by transitivity ) .",
    "we call laminations , generated by equivalence relations similar to @xmath6 above , _ q - laminations_. they form an important class of laminations , many of which correspond to complex polynomials with connected julia sets . in all these cases the lamination is found through the study of the topology of the julia set of the polynomial",
    ".    the drawback of this approach is that it fails if the topology of the julia set is complicated ( e.g. , if a quadratic polynomial has a fixed _",
    "cremer point _",
    "thus , even though ultimately laminations are a tool which allows one to study both individual polynomials and their parameter space , in some cases it is not obvious as to what laminations ( or what equivalence relations on the circle ) can be directly connected in a meaningful way to certain polynomials . hence one needs a non - direct way of associating a lamination ( or , more generally , some combinatorial structure ) to a polynomial with a complicated julia set .",
    "a possibility here is as follows . for a polynomial @xmath9 ,",
    "consider sequences of parameters @xmath10 with @xmath11 having locally connected julia sets and associated lamination @xmath12 .",
    "these laminations @xmath12 ( systems of chords of @xmath0 ) may converge to another lamination ( system of chords of @xmath0 ) in the sense that the continua @xmath13 may converge to a subcontinuum of @xmath2 in the hausdorff sense , and the limit continuum @xmath3 then comes from an appropriate lamination @xmath1 ) . in this case",
    "the lamination @xmath1 is called the _ hausdorff limit _ of laminations @xmath12 ; one may associate all such hausdorff limit laminations to @xmath14 .    using this notion of convergence",
    "one can define the hausdorff closures of sets of laminations .",
    "hence the space of laminations useful for studying polynomials could be a closed set of laminations which contains the hausdorff closure of the set of all q - laminations , but is not much bigger .    to describe a candidate set of laminations we introduce a new notion of a _ sibling invariant lamination _ which is slightly more restrictive than the one given by thurston .",
    "the new definition is given intrinsically ( i.e. , by only listing properties on the leaves of the lamination ) .",
    "we show that the family of all sibling invariant laminations is closed and contains all q - laminations .",
    "the new definition significantly simplifies the verification of the fact that a system of chords of @xmath0 is an invariant lamination .",
    "thurston @xcite introduced the class of _ clean _ laminations .",
    "we use our tools to show that clean laminations are ( up to a finite modification ) @xmath15-laminations .",
