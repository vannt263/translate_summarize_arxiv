    "<S> we study the percolation phase transition in hierarchical scale - free nets . depending on the method of construction , the nets can be fractal or small - world ( the diameter grows either algebraically or logarithmically with the net size ) , assortative or disassortative ( a measure of the tendency of like - degree nodes to be connected to one another ) , or possess various degrees of clustering . the percolation phase transition can be analyzed exactly in all these cases , due to the self - similar structure of the hierarchical nets . </S>",
