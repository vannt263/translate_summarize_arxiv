    "introduction    about 40 years ago , finkelstein and misner considered integer - valued quantities that are conserved during time evolution as they are protected by a topological index finmis . these quantities , which may be used to characterize a field configuration of an appropriate field theory , were named `` kinks '' thereafter fin .",
    "the idea of kinks is simple and by now standard : suppose you are dealing with a field theory where the fields take values in a space @xmath1 of non - trivial topology ( such as , e.g. , in a @xmath2-model ; in gravity this non - triviality results from the required signature of the metric ) .",
    "now consider the map @xmath3 from a @xmath4 hypersurface @xmath5 into @xmath1 given by the initial values of the field(s ) .",
    "if @xmath5 has non - trivial topology ( possibly due to boundary conditions imposed on the fields on an originally trivial space ) , it may well happen that there is more than one homotopy class in @xmath6 . in this case the initial data , resp .",
    "@xmath3 , single out some element @xmath7 .",
    "as time evolution is a smooth deformation of the map @xmath3 , it will not move @xmath3 out of its original homotopy class @xmath8 .",
    "thus , @xmath8 is a conserved quantity and for @xmath9 ( 0 denoting the trivial homotopy class defined by the constant map ) the field configuration is said to have a kink ( characterized by @xmath8 ) .    in 3 + 1",
    "gravity on a spacetime @xmath10 with @xmath5 being a 3-sphere , one has @xmath11 , the group of all integers finmis , steen .",
    "the situation is unchanged , if @xmath12 and one requires spacetime to be ( appropriately ) minkowskian asymptotically .",
    "such spacetimes are characterized by a kink - number @xmath13 therefore . in subsequent works",
    "then it has been shown that all spacetimes with @xmath14 have a `` twisting light - cone structure '' and gravitational kinks were in part viewed as `` black holes without curvature singularities '' ( cf . ,",
    "e.g. , finpr , mccollum , desitterkinks ) .",
    "this connection of homotopical considerations with those concerning the causal structure becomes most transparent for 1 + 1 dimensional spacetimes , which , as often , may serve as a suitable laboratory to improve one s understanding of the role of kinks in gravitational theories dunn . here",
    "@xmath15 separates @xmath16 ( the space of real symmetric matrices ) into three regions characterized by the signatures @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "the latter of these regions is @xmath20 . with",
    "@xmath21 one obtains @xmath22 , so that there again is a winding number @xmath23 characterizing kinks ( cf .",
    "fig .  1 of vasilic for a nice illustration ) .",
    "on the other hand , given an explicit kink metric , such as e.g.  the `` bare kink '' ) dunn , bare @xmath24 it is easily verified that the lightcone turns upside down @xmath23 times when going from @xmath25 to @xmath26 along a ( @xmath4)-line @xmath5 ( cf .",
    "1(_a _ ) ) .",
    "each such half - turn of the lightcone clearly defines a non - contractible loop in @xmath20 , which may serve as generator of @xmath27 . of the form @xmath28 with @xmath29 or @xmath30 , all of which are parallelizable . in the case of a more general ,",
    "not parallelizable spacetime manifold @xmath31 the metric is a section of a non - trivial bundle and the above homotopical considerations have to be modified accordingly . ]    in the literature 1 + 1 kink metrics have often been written down in explicit coordinates only desitterkinks , dunn , vasilic .",
    "their kink nature is then usually shown by studying the behaviour of the lightcone as sketched briefly in the example above .",
    "consequently , one rarely finds any global analysis of the resulting spacetimes ( the papers hawkgiul being a positive exception , where the kink - number of the boundary components of a 3 + 1 spacetime @xmath31 is shown to be directly related to the euler characteristic of @xmath31 ) . in the present paper",
    "we want to fill this gap at least partially .",
    "moreover , our analysis will lead to a systematic way of constructing new kink spacetimes .",
    "in particular it will enable us to construct , e.g. , a one - parameter family of distinct kinks of given kink - number for _ any _ given 1 + 1 metric with a local killing symmetry .",
    "kinks with @xmath32 instead of @xmath21 may also be obtained , provided only that the metric allows for appropriate asymptotic regions ( say , asymptotically flat or desitter ) ; however , in these cases the kink - number will turn out not to be an intrinsic property of the spacetime but rather a feature of the chosen coordinates .    while there is no problem in just writing down kink - metrics ( cf .",
    "e.g. ) ) , the more interesting cases are certainly those where the metric fulfills some extra conditions . as an example , many flat or desitter kink - metrics ( also in 3 + 1 dimensions ) have been studied desitterkinks , dunn , vasilic , physletts . at first sight , however , these solutions seem to be in conflict with a well - established approach : any maximally extended multiply connected spacetime should occur as a factor space of the simply connected _",
    "universal covering _ solution ; but neither from minkowski space nor from the universal covering of desitter space , kink solutions could be obtained in this way wolf , iii .",
    "this apparent paradox is resolved by noting that  even when requiring simple connectedness  there is no unique maximal ( analytic ) extension of a manifold ( such a warning has e.g.  already been expressed in footnote 15 of gerochzit ) : take , for instance , minkowski space , cut out a point and construct the universal covering of this punctured plane , which now winds around the removed point infinitely often in new layers ( cf .",
    "e.g.  fig .",
    "5(_d _ ) ) . clearly",
    ", this solution is no longer geodesically complete at the removed point but nevertheless maximally extended , since adding the point again would yield a conical singularity . identifying different layers of this manifold , maximally",
    "extended @xmath33-kinks can be obtained ; only the corresponding 2-kink is extendible , since insertion of the point restores minkowski space .",
    "certainly , these latter kink solutions ( and in fact all flat kinks or kinks of constant curvature ) are never geodesically complete . on the other hand , there are plenty of complete kinks . and @xmath34 for @xmath35 ( e.g.  @xmath36 ) .",
    "as shown in iii , ii the maximal extensions of this metric are geodesically complete kinks of arbitrary kink - number . if @xmath37 these kinks are no longer geodesically complete but nevertheless inextendible , since the curvature diverges at the incomplete boundaries then ( e.g.  the solutions * g4 , r2 * in iii , ii ) . ] in the case that they have a killing symmetry , a complete classification has been provided in iii . in section 2",
    "we will show by the example of the bare kink how searching rigorously for maximal extensions and applying the factorization method of iii allows us not only to shed some light on the geometry of these kinks but even to derive a whole bunch of related new ones . the same concepts  when applied to `` incomplete universal coverings '' like the one mentioned above  will also yield more interesting examples of incomplete kinks .",
    "this is demonstrated for the flat case in section 3 and generalized to arbitrary metrics with a killing field in section 4 . in section 4 ( as well as at the end of section 2 and in appendix a ) we will also provide explicit coordinate representations for the newly obtained kink metrics .    much of the interest in spacetimes with non - trivial kink - number centres around such spacetimes which are locally solutions to the field equations of some gravity model , i.e.  of some appropriate gravity action . since e.g.all solutions of generalized dilaton gravity models have a killing field banks , kunstatter , i , the scheme of the present paper allows for the construction of kink spacetimes for any of these models .",
    "but also conversely , for any given metric with a ( local ) killing symmetry , and hence also for all the kink metrics it gives rise to ( cf .",
    "secs .  2 and 4 )",
    ", there is some gravity action for which the metric solves the corresponding field equations i. let us thus briefly recollect some results about those metrics .",
    "here it is advisable to use a non - conformal gauge for the metric , in contrast to what is useful on other occasions such as in string theory , where the action is invariant under rescalings of the metric by a conformal factor : ) below have been used with success in the literature banks , nonconf , kuschw .",
    "in particular we use this opportunity to gratefully acknowledge here the influence of w. kummer on our work . bringing to our attention the success of non - conformal gauge conditions in a 2d gravity model kuschw ,",
    "was essential for our interest in two - dimensional gravity theories , culminating finally in a series of papers on this subject . ]",
    "any 2d metric with a ( local ) killing field may be represented locally in the generalized eddington - finkelstein ( ef ) form @xmath38 for some function @xmath8 ( cf , e.g. , ii ) .",
    "the killing field in these coordinates is clearly @xmath39 , its length squared equals @xmath8 , and the curvature scalar is @xmath40 .",
    "for a given metric the function @xmath8 in ) is generically unique up to an equivalence relation @xmath41 , @xmath42 . only for minkowski and desitter space",
    "this is not quite true , because they have more than one killing field ( in fact three ) .",
    "for instance , minkowski space can be described by @xmath43 , where different choices of @xmath44 may correspond to qualitatively different killing fields @xmath39 : @xmath45 implies that @xmath39 generates translations ( timelike , null , or spacelike , according to @xmath46 ) , whereas for @xmath47 linear in @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) the vector field @xmath50 generates boosts .",
    ", resemble the rindler coordinates rindler , @xmath51 ( substitute @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) , where also @xmath54 generates boosts .",
    "however , the ef - coordinates cover a considerably larger portion of minkowski space ( cf .",
    "8(_b _ ) ) . ] likewise , ( anti-)desitter space of curvature @xmath55 is described by @xmath56 , and again there are three qualitatively different killing fields @xmath39 according to @xmath46 ( cf .",
    "e.g.iii,ii ) .",
    "if the metric @xmath57 is analytic , furthermore , then the function @xmath8 is characteristic for the whole spacetime and there is a unique analytic simply - connected extension where the boundary ( to be defined properly ) is either complete or a curvature singularity ( called `` global '' in iii ; without such a requirement the extension is not unique , as mentioned before ) .",
    "an exposition of simple rules of how to obtain this extension and its penrose diagram from a given function @xmath8 may be found in ii .",
    "the multiply connected global solutions can be obtained by factoring these universal coverings by discrete symmetry groups or , equivalently , by cutting out some region of the universal covering and gluing appropriately iii . whereas the first approach is favourable for a concise classification , the second one is more straightforward and shall be employed here .",
    "an in some sense prototypical example of a kink - metric is the `` bare kink '' dunn , bare @xmath58 its null - extremals are calculated easily to @xmath59 and it is thus clear that the lightcone tilts with increasing @xmath60 ( cf .",

    "<S> following finkelstein and misner , kinks are non - trivial field configurations of a field theory , and different kink - numbers correspond to different disconnected components of the space of allowed field configurations for a given topology of the base manifold . in a theory of gravity , </S>",
    "<S> non - vanishing kink - numbers are associated to a twisted causal structure . in two dimensions this means , more specifically , that the light - cone tilts around ( non - trivially ) when going along a non - contractible non - selfintersecting loop on spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> one purpose of this paper is to construct the maximal extensions of kink spacetimes using penrose diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> this will yield surprising insights into their geometry but also allow us to give generalizations of some well - known examples like the bare kink and the misner torus . however , even for an arbitrary 2d metric with a killing field we can construct continuous one - parameter families of inequivalent kinks . </S>",
    "<S> this result has already interesting implications in the flat or desitter case , but it applies e.g.  also to generalized dilaton gravity solutions . </S>",
    "<S> finally , several coordinate systems for these newly obtained kinks are discussed .    </S>",
