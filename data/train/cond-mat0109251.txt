    "since akimitsu and co - workers presented a remarkably high temperature ( @xmath8 39 k ) superconducting magnesium diboride mgb@xmath3 in the beginning of 2001  @xcite , much attention has been focused on this diboride material and some related boride compounds @xcite .",
    "the material mgb@xmath3 takes the layered structure of b - mg - b stacking and has a coupling between 2-dimensional ( 2d ) b - b layers  @xcite .",
    "according to several band calculations  @xcite , in the mgb@xmath3-type crystal structure there exist a strong covalent b - b bonding and an ionic b - mg bonding .",
    "the strong covalent b - b bonding and the presence of the ionic mg atoms lead to hole - like cylindrical fermi surfaces in mgb@xmath3  @xcite , and the holes are conducted in each 2d b - b layer .",
    "it is observed that the 2d b - b layers , like the cu - o layers in high-@xmath2 cuprates , play an important role in the electrical transport properties  @xcite .",
    "the superconductor mgb@xmath3 can then be beautiful realization of the essential physics of superconductivity in cuprates , without the complications of cu @xmath9 orbitals  @xcite .    in a previous paper  @xcite , on the basis of a theoretical model of the b - b layers analogous to the cu - o layers  @xcite , we investigated the ionic diboride compounds ( m@xmath10)(b@xmath11 , @xmath12e.g .",
    ", ( mg@xmath10)(b@xmath11 in the case of mgb@xmath1@xmath13 , and discussed their superconducting critical temperature @xmath2 .",
    "we made investigation into @xmath2 assuming a simple linear relation between @xmath2 and the inter - layer charging energy @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "in the present paper , instead of assuming the linear relation , we will analyze @xmath2 and @xmath4 in more detail on the basis of an original formula for @xmath2 presened in refs .",
    "@xcite , and also mention general boride compounds mb@xmath0 in which the interstitial ionic atoms m between b - b layers are not restricted to m@xmath10 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to grope for various possible boride compounds with @xmath2 over 39 k and to give a hint as to new material synthesis . in the viewpoint of our theoretical model ,",
    "the recently discovered 117-kelvin superconductor c@xmath5chbr@xmath6  @xcite is also discussed .",
    "we model the boride compounds mb@xmath0 ( m@xmath14 mg , be , etc . ) as quantum - capacitive josephson junction arrays ( jja ) with weakly coupled superconducting grains on a 3d lattice , following kawabata - shenoy - bishop ( ksb ) theory  @xcite , originally proposed to the high-@xmath2 cuprates with 2d cu - o layers and a coupling between the cu - o layers . in the present jja model ,",
    "the josephson coupling energy @xmath15 via the cooper pair tunneling within and between the b - b layers enhances the critical temperature @xmath2 , while the charging energy @xmath4 between the b - b layers depresses @xmath2 .",
    "the origin of @xmath4 is that , when the cooper pairs tunnel between the layers , local inter - layer charge unbalance is induced between the superconducting grains in jja .",
    "this charge unbalance gives rise to the electric fields between the grains and it costs the electromagnetic energies and destroys the phase coherence of superconductivity  @xcite . here , an important point for our analysis is that the interstitial ionic atoms , m , located between the b - b layers play a role of capacitors , reducing the charging energy @xmath4 by the electric polarization of the ionic atom .",
    "we estimate @xmath2 which is a function of @xmath4 .",
    "according to the ksb theory  @xcite , in the present jja model @xmath2 is expressed , with an unknown function @xmath16 , as @xmath17 and for zero charging energy @xmath18 it must reduce to a known equation @xmath19 which is the dimensionless critical coupling  @xcite in terms of the coupling anisotropy @xmath20 in the classical anisotropic 3d xy / jja system @xmath12@xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the inter - layer josephson coupling energy , @xmath23 the intra - layer one , and @xmath24@xmath13 . in the 3d limit @xmath25",

    "one of the promising course of attaining higher @xmath2 is certainly to search for new spacer molecules which expand the separation between c@xmath7 molecules  @xcite .",
    "however , it seems to be open to further discussion whether the only 2 % expansion of the lattice constant is sufficient for the increase of the electronic density of states which corresponds to rather drastic rise of @xmath2 from 52 to 117 k.    in the viewpoint of our theory , we would like to point out another possibility that the intercalation molecules would play a role of the capacitors in the c@xmath7 superconductors as discussed for the atoms m in the boride compounds mb@xmath0 . by the electric polarization of the neutral molecules , the intercalation molecules such as chbr@xmath6 may reduce the charging energy @xmath4 between the c@xmath7 molecules which constitute a 3d jja as superconducting grains on a 3d lattice .",
