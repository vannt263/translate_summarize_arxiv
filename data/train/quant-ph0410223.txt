    "the combination of two unique features makes matter - wave diffraction of noble gas trimers an outstanding enterprise .",
    "firstly , diffraction presently is the only experimental technique which allows to detect such very weakly bound clusters and to determine their properties @xcite .",
    "secondly , the helium trimer @xmath4he@xmath5 is the only molecule predicted to possess an efimov - type bound state @xcite under normal conditions @xcite .",
    "only recently did diffraction of atomic and molecular beams evolve towards a precise experimental technique .",
    "early pioneering experiments had proved diffraction for a sodium beam through a grating initially fabricated for x - rays @xcite , as well as for meta - stable helium @xcite and for neon @xcite through micrometer double - slits .",
    "later , transmission gratings with a period of @xmath6 nm had brought an improvement , but finally the production of reliable nano - scale transmission gratings with a period of only @xmath7 nm @xcite paved the way for quantitative matter diffraction experiments with an unparalleled spatial coherence across up to a hundred slits for a helium atom beam @xcite .",
    "unprecedented , matter diffraction also allows to investigate the coherence properties of very heavy molecules with many internal degrees of freedom such as fullerenes @xcite .",
    "classical wave optics can merely serve as an approximation to the underlying physical scattering process of atom diffraction .",
    "the hierarchy of the diffraction peak intensities in a diffraction experiment with neutral atoms or molecules is significantly affected by the weak van der waals surface force , which acts on atoms in the vicinity of the material grating .",
    "this was included in a quantitative theory in refs .",
    "@xcite which allowed , in comparison with experimental data , to characterize this surface force for the noble gases helium , neon , argon , and krypton , and the covalently bound d@xmath8 molecule @xcite , as well as for meta - stable helium and neon @xcite .",
    "moreover , there is no analog in wave optics for the diffraction of weakly bound small noble gas van der waals clusters such as the helium dimer @xmath4he@xmath8 and trimer @xmath4he@xmath5 .",
    "experimental evidence for these delicate molecules was for the first time unambiguously provided through the mass - selective property of grating diffraction @xcite .",
    "moreover , the comparatively large interatomic distance of @xmath9 nm in @xmath4he@xmath8 , implied by the small binding energy @xmath10mk @xcite , was shown to manifest itself as an apparent narrowing of the grating slits by @xmath11 .",
    "it was this size effect which rendered possible the determination of @xmath1 from experimental diffraction data @xcite .",
    "this allowed for comparison with modern realistic helium - helium potentials of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "numerical studies of the helium trimer relying on these helium - helium potentials @xcite , quantum monte carlo simulations @xcite , as well as quantum chemical _ ab initio _ calculations @xcite have long predicted two bound states for @xmath4he@xmath5 : a ground state at @xmath12mk and a shallow excited state at @xmath13mk @xcite .",
    "moreover , the excited state is believed to be an efimov - type state .",
    "originally in the context of nuclear physics , efimov @xcite had shown that if the scattering length of a pair potential exceeds the effective range of the potential by far then a universal series of bound states exists in the three - body system near the dissociation threshold .",
    "examples for such efimov states , however , have been searched for in vain in three - nucleon systems , leaving the three - atomic helium molecule presently as the only candidate .",
    "the @xmath4he@xmath5 excited state can not experimentally be distinguished from the ground state by its mass .",
    "however , due to the large difference in binding energy , both predicted states have markedly different interatomic distances : @xmath14 nm in the ground state and @xmath15 nm in the excited state @xcite .",
    "therefore , the size effect , which had previously played the essential role in the dimer diffraction experiment and which we show to be @xmath16 for a trimer , is expected to render the two states distinguishable .",
    "et al _ have analyzed the mole fraction of small helium clusters ( including atoms ) in a nozzle beam diffraction setup and showed that up to 7% can be trimers @xcite .",
    "this should be an ample amount for a quantitative analysis .",
    "the population ratio of ground state vs.  excited state trimers in the beam is , however , not known .",
    "it is therefore essential to provide sufficient experimental resolution for the small ground state in order to evaluate diffraction data from a mixed beam .",
    "a limitation in the resolution is posed by the period of the grating , @xmath17 nm , and the slit width , typically @xmath18 nm , which are both large compared to the ground state size . transmission gratings with smaller periods and slit",
    "widths are , however , presently not available .    to address this issue we consider diffraction from a custom transmission grating at oblique ( non - normal ) incidence , i.e.  the grating is rotated by an angle @xmath19 about an axis parallel to its bars .",
    "the grating typically consists of a @xmath20 nm thick layer of silicon nitride into which the slits have been etched in a lithographic production process @xcite . as the grating",
    "is rotated the upstream edges of its bars cut into the incident beam , partially shadowing the slits . by this effect",
    "the projected slit @xmath21 width ( perpendicular to the incident beam ) decreases more strongly with @xmath19 than the projected period @xmath22 .",
    "since the diffraction pattern is roughly governed by the squared slit function @xcite @xmath23 ^ 2\\ ] ] where @xmath24 denotes the diffraction order , one expects that at non - normal incidence more atoms or molecules are diffracted into higher diffraction orders .",
    "for example , at @xmath25 nm and an angle of incidence ( rotation angle ) of @xmath26 the ratio @xmath27 is twice as large as @xmath28 ( normal incidence ) while the diffraction angles , to good approximation , only increase by the ratio @xmath29 .",
    "this effect increases the experimental resolution . due to the shadowing",
    ", however , the fundamental results obtained earlier for atom diffraction at normal incidence can not be carried over unchanged .",
    "while we illustrate our results using the experimentally most interesting case of helium trimer diffraction , the general findings of this work equally apply to other weakly - bound trimers , possibly consisting of non - identical atoms . the article is structured as follows . in section [ sec",
    ": generaltheory ] we derive , from quantum mechanical scattering theory , the transition amplitude for an atom diffracted from a bar of finite thickness . in section [ sec : atomtiltedgrating ] we construct a periodic transmission grating from many bars and introduce the notion of a slit at non - normal incidence .",
    "we show that if the slits are not aligned with the direction of periodicity a characteristic asymmetry of the diffraction pattern arises which went unnoticed in a previous experiment @xcite .",
    "the asymmetry is relevant for the precise evaluation of experimental data . in section [ sec : trimerscatteringtheory ] we outline the general scattering theory approach to trimer diffraction and work it out in section [ sec : trimertiltedgrating ] for non - normal trimer diffraction from a grating . in section [ sec : trimersize ] we provide the link between diffraction data and the trimer bond length and discuss aspects of a helium trimer diffraction experiment .",
    "in a typical beam diffraction experiment with an average beam velocity of the order of @xmath30 m/s the kinetic energy per atom is a few tens of mev , much less than electronic excitation energies of the atom .",
    "therefore , we treat atoms as point particles and neglect their electronic degrees of freedom throughout this article . the de broglie wavelength @xmath31 associated with the atomic motion is typically of the order of @xmath32 nm whereas a typical length scale of the scattering object is @xmath7 nm .",
    "we shall , in the following , refer to this relation as the _ diffraction condition _ : @xmath33    the free hamilton operator for an atom of mass @xmath34 is @xmath35 .",
    "the interaction between the diffracting object and the atom will be described by a lennard - jones @xcite type surface potential @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the position of the atom .",
    "this interaction exhibits a strongly repulsive core at a distance @xmath38 from the diffracting object of the order of the atomic diameter , and it passes into a weak attractive @xmath39 van der waals potential at @xmath40 nm @xcite . due to the low kinetic energy of the atoms in the beam",
    "it is sufficient for the purposes of this work to model the repulsive part of the interaction by a hard core .",
    "the attractive part will be omitted for the moment and will be be included later in sec .",
    "[ sec : atomtiltedgrating ] .",

    "the babinet principle of wave optics states that two complementary objects , such as a slit and a bar of the same width , cause the same diffraction pattern outside the direction of illumination ( forward scattering ) @xcite .",

    "one grating bar is simply a special case of the general scattering object considered in the previous section . in the following we arrange @xmath83 identical bars to create a",
    "regularly spaced periodic transmission grating . while the simplest and most familiar situation in which the bars are aligned along their common shadow line ( @xmath84-axis , cf .",
    "[ fig : atom_scattering ] ) is treated in virtually every textbook on optics ( e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we are not aware of a more general treatment where the individual shadow lines are not parallel to the alignment axis .",
    "this situation arises naturally , however , for diffraction from a grating with bars of finite thickness at non - zero angle of incidence ( cf .",

    "we note that apart from the period an additional length scale of the grating is given by the distance between the bars . depending on the angle of incidence",
    "the ( projected ) distance can become small or even zero .",

    "the transition amplitude of a grating of @xmath83 bars with period @xmath85 along the @xmath86-axis can be written as the coherent sum of the spatially translated amplitudes of each bar :    [ eq : atom_transampl_gra ] @xmath87    in the second line , the sum has been carried out and replaced by the grating function @xcite @xmath88 whose argument is the momentum transfer along the direction of periodicity @xmath86 .",
    "( [ eq : atom_transampl_gra ] ) yields , in principle , a satisfactory description of the diffraction problem in terms of atom scattering from a bar . the literature on optics",
    ", however , commonly adapts a complementary point of view by focusing on the apertures ( slits ) between the bars rather than on the aperture stops ( bars ) themselves .",
    "this is expressed , for example , by the kirchhoff integral of optics @xcite . in recent work",
    "this viewpoint has also proven very useful in the field of atom and molecule diffraction from a transmission grating : small quantum mechanical effects such as the van der waals interaction @xcite between the atoms in the beam and the grating as well as the finite size of the helium dimer @xcite manifest themselves as an apparent reduction of the slit width of the grating . in these articles",
    "the respective quantities could be determined quite precisely by comparison of the reduced slit width with the true geometrical slit width . unlike for grating diffraction at normal incidence , however ,",
    "it is initially not evident how to define a slit in the case of non - normal incidence : the correct choice may depend on the angle of incidence .",
    "we provide , therefore , a mathematical prescription which converts eq .",

    "fig : in_trimer_cumulants ] yields @xmath356 for @xmath26 as compared to @xmath357 for normal incidence .",
    "this roughly twofold gain in sensitivity is expected to halve the final error bars on @xmath1 .    finally , since the population ratio of the two predicted @xmath4he@xmath5 states in the nozzle beam is generally unknown the situation of a mixed beam must be considered .",
    "to analyze this we have summed diffraction patterns as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : in_trimer_cumulants ] and [ fig : in_trimer_cumulants - ef ] for different population ratios .",
    "hereafter , we have used eq .",
    "( [ eq : trimer_intensity_cumul ] ) to determine , from the summed patterns , an average effective slit width @xmath160 and from this an average bond length @xmath1 .",
    "it turned out that the such determined @xmath1 varies almost linearly with the population ratio from the ground state value of @xmath1 ( pure ground state beam ) to the excited state value ( pure excited state beam ) .",
    "therefore , three possible outcomes of an experiment are to be expected . a value of @xmath358 nm would be attributed to the ground state and indicate a negligible ( or zero ) population of the excited state .",
    "equivalently , a result of about @xmath359 nm would doubtlessly provide evidence for the excited state and its large pair distance .",
    "thirdly , a value in between these two would indicate that both states are present and evidence for the excited state would still be available .",
    "a controlled variation of the accessible beam parameters might then allow to influence the population ratio in favor of either state and to measure the pair distance for one state with less disturbance by the other .",
    "motivated by the long - standing interest in the efimov effect @xcite we have studied the diffraction of weakly bound trimers in a typical matter optics setup . as an earlier diffraction experiment for the spatially extended helium dimer ( @xmath9 nm ) @xcite",
    "had indicated that the resolution provided by a custom @xmath18 nm transmission grating , at normal incidence , may be insufficient to resolve the helium trimer ground state ( @xmath14 nm predicted @xcite ) it had suggested itself to use oblique ( non - normal ) incidence at a rotated transmission grating for reducing the projected slit width .",
    "the partial shadowing of the slits caused by the finite thickness of the etched material grating has required , however , a revision of the theory of atom diffraction . in particular , the familiar mirror symmetry encountered in diffraction patterns from normal incidence is lifted for non - normal incidence .",
    "this effect was visible in fig .  5 of ref .",
    "@xcite but went unnoticed .",
    "it has been traced back to the non - alignment of the direction of periodicity of the grating with the shadow lines of its bars , or , equivalently , its slit lines .",
    "the weak attractive van der waals surface interaction , which introduces an additional but minor asymmetry , has been taken into account in a way similar to the case of normal incidence .    using atom diffraction as one building block , the multi - channel many - body quantum mechanical scattering theory approach of refs .",
    "@xcite has been extended to derive the constitutive formulas of trimer diffraction . while this procedure structurally partly parallels that of dimer diffraction it is mathematically more complex due to the additional atom .",
    "the resulting equations for the trimer diffraction pattern , however , have been readily interpretable and provide intuitive physical insight into diffraction of weakly bound molecules : the significant measurable quantity is the quantum mechanical expectation value of the `` width '' ( projected diameter ) of the trimer perpendicular to its flight direction . for identical boson trimers , such as the helium trimer ,",
    "the width is related to the molecular bond length by @xmath16 .",
    "this fact can be used , in principle , to determine @xmath1 from a matter diffraction experiment .    if a transmission grating of the type used earlier by grisenti _",
    "et al _ @xcite is rotated by @xmath26 the projected slits appear approximately half as wide as the nominal slits of the grating .",
    "this leads to an estimated doubling of the resolution , sufficient to determine the ground state pair distance of @xmath4he@xmath5 .",
    "moreover , should the @xmath4he@xmath5 efimov state , whose pair distance is predicted to be larger by almost an order of magnitude @xcite , exist and should its population in the beam be significant , it ought to be clearly distinguishable from the ground state solely by its size .",
    "we would like to thank r.  brhl , o.  kornilov , a.  kalinin , t.  khler and j.p .",
    "toennies for stimulating discussions .",
    "this research was supported by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft .",
    "earlier work has shown that at beam velocities typically encountered in matter diffraction experiments the effective reduction of the slit width due to both the van der waals surface interaction and the finite molecular size can be of the same order of magnitude @xcite . a quantitative determination of the atom transmission function @xmath108 , which was inserted into eq .",
    "( [ eq : atom_slitfunction ] ) , is therefore necessary . as in ref .",
    "@xcite we use the eikonal approximation to write @xmath360 $ ] for @xmath90 inside the slit , and @xmath361 outside .",
    "the phase function @xmath362 is given by @xcite @xmath363 where the straight path of integration @xmath364 must be taken to run parallel to the direction of incidence , and to cross the slit line @xmath91 at the position @xmath90 .",
    "the surface interaction @xmath365 at a position @xmath366 between two bars is calculated from the integration of an attractive @xmath367 potential of lennard - jones type ( the repulsive part has already been modeled by the boundary conditions in sec .  [",
