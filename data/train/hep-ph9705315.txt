    "supersymmetric models with conserved @xmath2-parity have in the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) a natural candidate for dark matter .",
    "this very appealing feature has motivated much work ( see @xcite for review and references ) and many increasingly sophisticated studies on the field .",
    "most of these analyses have concentrated in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with or without theoretical constraints on its wide parameter space .",
    "it is important , however , to keep an open mind to the possibility that this simplest supersymmetric generalization of the standard model may not be the one realized in nature .",
    "one should be careful not to identify the predictions of the mssm with those generic of low - energy supersymmetry . in this respect",
    "it is healthy to explore ( well motivated ) extensions of the mssm in search of phenomenological ( or cosmological ) consequences that are different from those expected in the minimal model .    perhaps among the best motivated extended models are those that include an additional @xmath0 factor in the gauge group , broken radiatively at some scale below @xmath5 by the vev of a standard model singlet @xmath1 .",
    "this type of models can be generically expected to arise as the low - energy limit of some string models @xcite and have a number of interesting consequences both at the phenomenological ( e.g. for @xmath6 and higgs physics ) and theoretical level ( e.g. they can accommodate a natural solution to the @xmath7-problem ) . for a detailed study of this kind of scenarios",
    "we refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite . in this letter",
    "we would like to consider the lightest neutralino in this type of models as a possible good dark matter candidate .",
    "we do not attempt a complete exploration of the parameter space of these models ( even wider than that of the mssm ) but rather focus on a particular region in which the lsp has properties completely different from those that could be expected in the mssm . as is described in the next section , in the region we study , the lsp is a neutralino mainly composed of the fermionic superpartner of the singlet used to break the extra @xmath0 .",
    "the relic density of such particle , computed in section  3 , turns out to be of the right order of magnitude for an interesting dark matter candidate , and the prospects for its laboratory detection are estimated in section  4 .",
    "finally , in section  5 we present some conclusions .",
    "the symmetry breaking sector in these models includes a chiral multiplet @xmath1 , singlet under the standard model gauge group but with a @xmath8 charge @xmath9 .",
    "this field couples in the superpotential [ super ] w = h s h_1 h_2 , to the usual higgs doublets @xmath10 , @xmath11 [ with @xmath8 charges @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively ; gauge invariance requires @xmath14 and the @xmath7 parameter is dynamically generated by the vev of @xmath1 as @xmath15 .",
    "the masses of the neutral gauge bosons @xmath16 and @xmath6 are m_z - z^2= , where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 are the gauge couplings of @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath8 respectively , and @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 are the vevs of @xmath24 with @xmath25 . for numerical work",
    "we use @xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath27 mixing angle is constrained experimentally to be less than a few times @xmath28 ( although larger values are allowed in some cases , e.g. , if the @xmath6 has leptophobic couplings ) .",
    "we will assume in this paper @xmath29 so that the requirement of a small @xmath27 mixing will force @xmath30 to be close to 1 .",
    "this constraint is less stringent for larger values of @xmath31 .",
    "the neutralino sector has an extra @xmath8 bino and an additional higgsino @xmath32 ( the _ singlino _ ) besides the four mssm neutralinos .",
    "the @xmath33 mass matrix reads ( in the basis @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) : @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the gaugino masses associated with @xmath8 , @xmath21 and @xmath20 respectively .",
    "if we assume unification of the gaugino masses at the gauge unification scale , @xmath44 are in the proportion @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a normalization constant . with this assumption ,",
    "the neutralino mass matrix depends ( for fixed charges ) on two unknown mass parameters , @xmath47 and @xmath31 ( through @xmath48 ) and the dimensionless @xmath30 . in fig .",
    "1 we give a contour plot of the lightest neutralino mass @xmath49 in the plane @xmath50 for @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "this mass is zero along a line in the half - plane @xmath53 . for the study of the region around this line ( where @xmath54 will be quite light ) it is useful to define the normalized neutralino state @xmath55 : & = & , [ n ] where @xmath56 ( when the @xmath27 mixing angle is small due to cancellations , @xmath57 ) ; @xmath58 ; @xmath59 and @xmath60",
    "this state gives a precise analytic description of the @xmath54 composition near the @xmath61 line .",
    "this is also shown in fig .  1 where the thick solid line delimits the area in which the lightest neutralino has a @xmath55 purity @xmath62 .",
    "in this region @xmath31 is typically large ( @xmath63 gev ) so that @xmath64 is expected to be small .",
    "to first order in @xmath64 we can approximate : [ pure ] .",
    "if we write = n_10+n_30_1 ^ 0 + n_40_2 ^ 0+n_50 , [ compo ] we find numerically @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 in the region of interest .",
    "this is our dark matter candidate and it is basically singlino dominated , with a small higgsino doublet component and an even smaller @xmath68 part .",
    "this result is independent of the assumption of unification of the gaugino masses and holds as long as they are large enough .",
    "more precisely , we would have obtained the same eq .",
    "( [ n ] ) provided @xmath69 at the electroweak scale .",
    "the rest of neutralinos ( and charginos ) have masses controlled by the large gaugino masses and @xmath48 and are thus much heavier than @xmath54 . in these models",
    "the typical soft mass scale is of order @xmath31 so that the spectrum of superpartners is expected to have masses of similar magnitude ( a possible exception could be the lightest stop because of a sizeable @xmath70 mixing ) .",
    "the fact that electroweak symmetry occurs at a lower scale ( and thus @xmath71 ) is a result of accidental cancellations among soft masses ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the lightest scalar higgs boson , @xmath72 , remains also at the electroweak scale ( roughly given by @xmath73 ) while the rest of higgs states ( two more scalars @xmath74 , one pseudoscalar @xmath75 and a charged pair @xmath76 ) have heavy masses comparable to @xmath31 .",
    "when @xmath54 is so light that the decay @xmath77 is kinematically allowed it gives an extra contribution to the invisible @xmath16 width .",
    "the lep constraint @xmath78 mev @xcite is however easily satisfied ; the coupling of @xmath54 to the @xmath16 boson is proportional to @xmath79 and this is small , first , because @xmath80 is close to 1 as required to suppress the @xmath27 mixing , and second , because @xmath64 is also small .    in the region of parameters described above , @xmath54 is the lsp and , with the assumption of conserved @xmath2-parity , becomes a possible candidate for cold dark matter .",
    "the present relic abundance of @xmath54 s ( @xmath81 ) is determined by their annihilation cross section at freeze - out , which , in the non - relativistic expansion applicable in this case , we write as _ ann v a + v^2 , [ sigma ] where @xmath82 is the relative velocity of @xmath54 s in the c.m .",
    "the freeze - out temperature @xmath83 ( and thus @xmath82 ) can be iteratively computed from the condition ( obtained from the equality of annihilation and expansion rates ) : x_f= , where @xmath84 is the planck mass , @xmath85 the number of relativistic degrees of freedom at @xmath83 ( @xmath86 ) and _ annv = a+(b - a ) , is the thermally averaged cross section @xcite . typically @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "for the range of masses we consider , @xmath89 , @xmath83 is above the qcd quark - hadron phase transition and below the electroweak phase transition .",
    "the neutralino relic density is then _",
    "h^2 = , [ omega ] where @xmath90 is the critical density and @xmath91 is the hubble constant in units of @xmath92 .",
    "@xmath54 s in that mass range can annihilate only into standard model fermion - antifermion pairs ( top quarks excluded ) .",
    "the relevant processes are mediated by @xmath16 , @xmath6 and neutral higgs bosons in the s - channel or by sfermions in the t - channel .",
    "the cross section formulae for the mssm @xcite can be easily generalized to our model . for the particle spectrum and neutralino composition described previously , the cross section is dominated by @xmath6 exchange with ( @xmath93 $ ] ) : a_f = _ f g_1 ^ 4 [ q_f^a q_]^2 , [ azp ] and b_f = b_zz^(f)+ ( -+)a_f , with b_zz^(f)=_f ( ) ^2 . in this formulas ,",
    "@xmath94 for leptons ( quarks ) in the final state , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 for a @xmath54 with composition as given by eq .",
    "( [ compo ] ) .",
    "the axial and vector @xmath8 charges of the final state fermions are q_f^a=  , q_f^v=  . the dependence of @xmath98 on these charges introduces some model dependence in the results .",
    "however , annihilation into @xmath99 usually dominates so that @xmath81 depends basically on @xmath100 , which is equal to @xmath101 if the bottom mass is generated by @xmath102 .",
    "other subdominant annihilation channels are discussed below :    @xmath103 the amplitude for @xmath104-mediated annihilation , which is usually dominant for higgsino lsp s , is proportional to @xmath105 , and therefore is doubly suppressed in our case : @xmath106 implies @xmath107 and , furthermore , @xmath108 and @xmath109 are very small .",
    "@xmath103 the t - channel contribution from sfermions , which are expected to have masses comparable to @xmath31 , is suppressed by extra powers of small yukawa couplings and/or the smallness of @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 .",
    "@xmath103 the amplitude for @xmath113 has a gauge part suppressed by the smallness of @xmath114 , @xmath115 .",
    "there is also a new part proportional to @xmath116 due to the new yukawa coupling in the superpotential ( [ super ] ) and , the sizeable value expected for @xmath91 ( @xmath117 from renormalization group analyses @xcite ) , can in principle compensate for the smallness of @xmath111 , @xmath112 .",
    "however , assuming @xmath118 , the @xmath75 contribution is suppressed with respect to the @xmath6 contribution by an extra factor @xmath119 .",
    "@xmath103 the same suppression factor appears for @xmath120 . in addition , the @xmath121 coupling goes like @xmath122 in the limit @xmath123 and thus is unimportant for @xmath106 .",
    "@xmath103 in the limit @xmath124 , the third scalar , @xmath125 , is singlet dominated and does not mediate the annihilation into fermions .",
    "@xmath103 more important can be the @xmath72 mediated annihilation ; the suppression factor @xmath119 can be compensated by the fact that @xmath126 can not be as heavy as @xmath31 and , in addition , there can be a resonant enhancement of the cross section for @xmath127 .",
    "nevertheless , we have checked numerically that this channel can also be neglected .",
    "first , the cp odd nature of the @xmath128 s - wave initial state forces @xmath72 to contribute to @xmath98 only to order @xmath129 .",
    "second , in these models the mass of @xmath72 receives extra contributions and is given by m_h^0 ^ 2=v_w^2 + _ rad m_h^0 ^ 2 , where the last piece , coming from loop corrections can also be sizeable .",
    "one sees that , even in the case @xmath51 , the tree - level mass can easily be as large as @xmath130 , and @xmath131 is never close to the pole for light @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath103 finally , as we showed above , the rest of neutralinos and the charginos are much heavier than @xmath54 and `` co - annihilation '' effects ( such as @xmath132 or @xmath133 ) play no role .",
    "figure  2 shows the relic density of @xmath54 s vs. its mass for different values of @xmath31 from 300 gev ( lower curve ) to 800 gev ( upper ) .    for concreteness ,",
    "we have fixed @xmath134 and @xmath135 in eq .",
    "( [ n ] ) and included higgs subdominant annihilation channels to compute the abundance .",
    "we use @xmath52 and fix @xmath136 , and @xmath137 . in the range of @xmath49 shown",
    ", @xmath6 gives the dominant annihilation channel , as explained above , so that larger @xmath31 reduces the annihilation rate making the relic abundance grow .",
    "for @xmath138 , @xmath72-exchange starts to be important and reduces significantly the relic density .",
    "smaller values of the @xmath8 charges would also tend to increase the abundance but , on the other hand , @xmath139 is lighter in that case and will become important for lighter values of @xmath49 .    in the figure , we show only the region @xmath140 , conservative limit which follows from a lower bound on the age of the universe of @xmath141 . taking the uncertainty in the hubble constant to be @xmath142",
    ", the cosmologically interesting range is @xmath143 if @xmath54 s form a significant fraction of the total dark matter in the universe .",
    "the upper bound @xmath144 sets a lower limit on the value of @xmath145 for which @xmath54 is a good cdm candidate , given fixed values of the charges and @xmath31 .",
    "this lower bound increases with @xmath31 and can be very small for low @xmath31 without conflicting with experimental bounds from @xmath104 decays .",
    "a non - negligible @xmath146 rate usually implies a sizeable @xmath6 production cross section at hadron colliders and one should check that the interesting region for @xmath81 is not in conflict with the non - observation of @xmath6 events ( basically @xmath147 ) at the tevatron cdf and d0 experiments . the lower limits on @xmath31 obtained by these experiments are model - dependent ( all the @xmath8 charges and masses of the possible decay products of @xmath6 enter the computation ) and we do not attempt such detailed analysis .",
    "we remark , however , that the supersymmetric decays of the @xmath6 ( in particular the invisible decay @xmath148 can be very important ) reduce significantly the @xmath149 branching ratio , so that the usual limits on @xmath31 are relaxed @xcite and can be easily evaded in our model .",
    "it is illustrative to compare our dark matter candidate with similar light higgsino candidates proposed in other supersymmetric models . in the mssm one such light neutralino , with composition @xmath150 , was studied in @xcite motivated by the susy interpretation of the cdf @xmath151 event .",
    "the @xmath152 coupling , proportional to @xmath153 , is reduced for @xmath106 .",
    "this suppresses the contribution to the invisible @xmath104 width and the @xmath154 cross - section , producing relic abundances in the interesting range .    in the nmssm , the minimal model extended by an extra singlet but no additional @xmath0 ,",
    "another light higgsino dark matter candidate was studied in @xcite ( for more general analyses of nmssm neutralino dark matter see @xcite ) . in this case",
    "@xmath155 with all three components of similar magnitude .",
    "the contribution to @xmath156 , also proportional to @xmath157 in this case , is further reduced by the non - negligible @xmath32 component . if @xmath158 , the relic abundance would be too large because @xmath32 s do not annihilate efficiently .",
    "our model is similar to the previous case but with @xmath32 dominant in the @xmath54 composition .",
    "now , however , @xmath54 s annihilate through @xmath146 .",
    "the rate is not too large due to the smallness of @xmath159 and the large mass of the @xmath6 boson , resulting in a relic abundance of the right order of magnitude .    finally , some comments from the model building point of view are in order .",
    "the region of parameter space we have examined corresponds to @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "such hierarchy of masses can not be easily accommodated in models with universal boundary conditions at a high energy scale ( a gut scale or the string scale ) and would rather point to models in which soft breaking is dominated by gaugino masses .",
    "models of this kind ( in the context of the mssm ) have been considered in the past @xcite . a renormalization group analysis of the evolution of parameters from low - energy to the string scale , with particular attention to symmetry breaking constraints , would be required .",
    "if @xmath54 s form the bulk of the dark matter in our galactic halo ( with density @xmath162 measured by its gravitational effects ) , we would like to estimate the prospects for its detection .",
    "we focus on direct detection experiments , which are the best suited for small mass wimps . in these experiments",
    "one hopes to detect calorimetrically nuclear recoils in specialized materials after elastic scattering with the flux of @xmath54 s . in the limit @xmath163 , the ( spin - dependent ) @xmath54-nucleus",
    "scattering proceeds by @xmath6 exchange and the rate of events per day and kg of material is @xcite [ rate ] r=(v)_sd , where @xmath164 is the nucleus mass , @xmath165 takes into account the nuclear form factor suppression and velocity distribution of @xmath54 s , and @xcite _ sd = m_r^2 ^ 2 . in this formula",
    ", @xmath166 is the spin of the nucleus , @xmath167 is the reduced mass of the @xmath54-nucleon system , @xmath168 ( @xmath169 ) is the quark spin content of the proton ( neutron ) , @xmath170 is the expectation value of the spin content of the proton ( or neutron ) group in the nucleus and finally d_q = g_1^2 , gives the effective neutralino - quark axial coupling .    for non - zero @xmath111 , @xmath112 there is also a scalar interaction mediated by @xmath72 exchange .",
    "the corresponding rate is of the form ( [ rate ] ) with a different form factor @xmath171 and @xmath172 replaced by _",
    "sc = m_r^2 ^ 2 .",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath173 are the nuclear charge and atomic number respectively .",
    "@xmath174 and @xmath175 , the effective scalar couplings of @xmath54 to protons and neutrons , are proportional to f_h^(p , n)=n_50(n_30 + n_40 ) , and @xmath176 are the proton and neutron masses , so that @xmath177 . for heavy nuclei , the @xmath178 factor can compensate for the smallness of @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath179 eventually dominates over the spin - dependent rate .",
    "we have computed the total rate ( spin - dependent plus scalar ) for two typical materials used in dark matter detectors , @xmath180ge and @xmath181si , both with @xmath182 .",
    "the results , as a function of @xmath49 , are presented in fig .  3 for the same choice of parameters used in fig .  2 .",
    "in each set of curves , the upper one corresponds to @xmath183 and the lowest to @xmath184 .",
    "for @xmath185 the curves are nearly indistiguishable : the spin - dependent rate is negligible and the scalar rate ( independent of @xmath31 ) gives all the effect .",
    "the small difference between the two limiting curves in each set shows that the scalar interaction provides the dominant effect .",
    "the rates obtained are below the current experimental sensitivity @xcite . for instance the cdms experiment , using germanium , is planning on obtaining a sensitivity of @xmath186 event / kg / day after a year of exposure .",
    "however , the next generation of experiments is expected to achieve sensitivities @xmath187 event / kg / day and therefore , we conclude that @xmath54 s could well be on the reach of near future experiments .",
    "in supersymmetric models with an extra @xmath0 ( broken at the tev scale by the vev of an standard model singlet @xmath1 ) the lsp neutralino can be singlino dominated .",
    "we have showed that the thermal relic density of this fermion , stable if @xmath2-parity is conserved , can be of the right order of magnitude to be a good cold dark matter candidate .",
    "we have also estimated direct detection rates at typical cryogenic devices in search of halo dark matter and found that they are typically small but may be reachable by the next generation of experiments .",
