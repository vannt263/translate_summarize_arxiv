    "a semiconductor heterostructure can be modelled by a system of equations describing ( with a certain degree of completeness and precision ) the state of the system .",
    "the equations depend on a set of structural and compositional data ( scd ) .",
    "essentially , these are the spatial dependence of the chemical composition ( including dopant profiles ) , the applied external fields , etc .",
    "the system s behavior ( response ) is described by functional data ( fd ) , such as the electric or thermal conductance , the energy dependence of the electron transmittance , the wavelength dependence of the optical absorption coefficient , etc .",
    "the fd can be computed using the solution of the equations , and are thus functionals of the scd .    to design a heterostructure for a certain application",
    "is to find a set of scd , which is physically ( and technologically ) achievable , such that the values of a chosen subset of fd will be within desirable ranges .",
    "the designer solves thus an inverse problem : inverting the functional dependence of the fd on the scd .",
    "this problem is rather ill - posed .",
    "the desired ranges of fp may be unachievable . generally speaking ,",
    "even if a certain desired set of fd values is achievable , the set of scd which achieves it is not unique .",
    "this absence of uniqueness is not bad in itself . if several solutions _ can be obtained _",
    ", then one may further optimize the design in terms of other properties which were not included in the original specifications .",
    "the difficulty is mathematical .",
    "inverting a one - to - one functional dependence can be a formidable task , which is further aggravated by the lack of uniqueness .    a brute - force approach to",
    "the problem is always possible : computing the fd for a set of achievable scd ( ideally all ) and selecting the best . in practice ,",
    "brute force optimization is restricted to rather small sets of parameters describing the fd .",
    "this is mostly due the fact that any conceivable penalty function will be non - convex .",
    "its graph will have a rather complex multi - valley shape . the search algorithm is forced to do a thorough investigation of this landscape and will eventually fail through run time limitations .",
    "the intelligent designer will partially avoid such restrictions by noting trends , trying to break the design into combining manageable blocks and locally improving promising configurations .",
    "thus , cases when the solution of the inverse problem is realizable by methods which are less costly than the brute force approach can be rather useful . even if one has to simplify somewhat the physical model , precious insights on new promising configurations can be obtained .    in this paper",
    "we will try to review the possible applications of inverse scattering techniques to some aspects of heterostructure design",
    ". our physical model for the electron states in the heterostructure will be the ( one band ) effective mass approximation for the envelope function of the ( conduction band ) electrons .",
    "the simplest approach is to assume a constant effective mass .",

    "various models can be considered for @xmath7 : a hartree self consistent potential , exchange - correlation corrections can be incorporated .",
    "the only requirement is that @xmath7 has to be an _",

    "the next step is to take into account the spatial dependence of the effective mass .",
    "the schrdinger equation with constant effective mass ( se ) for the envelope function , ( [ s1 ] ) , is replaced by the bendaniel and duke@xcite equation ( bdd ) : @xmath9 here the effective mass of the conduction band electrons @xmath10 $ ] is assumed to depend only on the local chemical composition @xmath5 .",

    "one could also select a nonzero value of @xmath34 at which ( [ refl ] ) is valid , such as the one corresponding to the transverse thermal energy at the desired operating temperature .",
    "since only the energy dependence of the reflectance is given , the first step in solving our problem is to find the sets of scattering data ( sd ) which are compatible with @xmath35 , _",

    "we show how to construct sd which correspond to real valued potentials @xmath36 with exponential decay at infinity from @xmath35 .",
    "physically , one might expect that the potential is determined by the its bound state energies and its resonances .",
    "the reflectance @xmath35 embodies only information on the transmission resonances : sharp minima of the reflectance .",
    "there is another type of resonance , the reflection resonances , analogous to the resonances that occur in three - dimensional potential scattering on a spherically symmetric potential .",
    "these are sharp _ phase _ variations of the reflection coefficients .",
    "the information on reflection resonances and on the bound states is not apparent in the reflectance .",
    "the transformations of the sd , which do not change the reflectance , will be discussed .",

    "the reference solutions have no bound states and simpler analytic properties",
    ". combinations of reflectance - preserving transformations can then be used to obtain the sd of other solutions to the phase reconstruction problem from the reference solutions , by dressing them up with bound states and reflection resonances .",
    "we will use pad approximation methods@xcite to represent the scattering data and to find parameterizations for a large class of solutions , corresponding to potentials which tend exponentially to zero at infinity .",
    "we will find that on this type of input data , the ( re)construction process amounts essentially to finding the roots of some polynomials and grouping them into subsets .",
    "in section [ rat ] we present a simple and efficient algorithm for solving the inverse scattering problem for scattering data in the form obtained in section [ pha ] .",

    "we show that obtaining chemical composition profiles and self - consistent potentials for them in the se in the inverse scattering approach is simpler than obtaining the self - consistent potential for a given chemical composition profile .",
    "we also discuss the functional equation which must be solved for obtaining the chemical ( effective mass ) profile corresponding to self - consistent potentials in the bendaniel and duke s equation .    for the reader s convenience , in appendix [ appa ] we give a brief outline of results from scattering and inverse scattering theory , which are needed and often referred to in the main body of the paper .",

    "we assume that the reflectance , @xmath35 , is known on the positive energy half - axis , @xmath40 .",
    "we want to construct sets of sd which satisfy ( [ refl ] ) .",
    "since the values of the sd for scattering by short - range and piecewise continuous potentials must satisfy the constraints@xcite which are enumerated at the end of appendix [ i - m ] , the function @xmath35 can not be arbitrary .",
    "it must be non - negative and smaller than unity , with the exception of @xmath41 , which is generically@xcite equal to 1 .",

    "the transmittance @xmath43 , where @xmath39 is the complex transmission coefficient , is readily recovered from @xmath44 .",
    "thus , we know the absolute values of the scattering data and we need the phases .      the problem of finding the phases of the scattering coefficients knowing only their absolute values on the real axis is underdetermined and has an infinite number of solutions . before considering the phase ( re)construction problem , we will introduce two types of transformations which modify the phases of the scattering data without changing the reflectance .",
    "let the set of scattering data @xmath45 be a solution of the phase reconstruction problem , _",
    "i.e. _ the scattering coefficients satisfy ( [ refl ] ) and the conditions enumerated at the end of appendix [ i - m ] .",
    "then , as mentioned above , if the sd ( [ sd ] ) , has no bound states , there is an unique solution to the inverse scattering problem : a potential @xmath36 in ( [ 2s ] ) such that the sd calculated for this equation coincide with ( [ sd ] ) .",
    "if @xmath39 has @xmath38 simple imaginary poles in the upper half plane , that is @xmath38 bound states , then a @xmath38-parameter family of potentials can be constructed , such that the sd of each potential coincides with ( [ sd ] ) .",
    "let now @xmath46 be a positive number , such that @xmath47 is not a pole of @xmath39 , _",
    "i.e. _ that @xmath48 is not a bound state of ( [ sd ] ) . define a new set of sd by the transformation : @xmath49 the new set of sd will also satisfy the conditions set out at the end of appendix [ i - m ] , so that a @xmath50-parameter family of potentials can be constructed with each potential having the sd ( [ lam1]-[lam3 ] ) .",
    "the transformation ( [ lam1]-[lam3 ] ) can also remove bound states .",
    "if the initial sd , ( [ sd ] ) , have a bound state for @xmath48 , then the transformation ( [ lam1]-[lam3 ] ) with @xmath51 changed into @xmath52 in the right - hand sides of the equations , transforms that bound state into an _",
    "anti - bound _ state  an imaginary pole of @xmath39 in @xmath53 , leaving all the others in place .",
    "let @xmath54 be an arbitrary complex number with nonzero real and imaginary parts .",
    "then , we can define a second type of reflectance preserving transformation of the sd ( [ sd ] ) : @xmath55 here and in the following , we use the notation @xmath56 for complex conjugation .",
    "the transformed sd , ( [ zet1]-[zet3 ] ) , have the same reflectance and bound states as ( [ sd ] ) and satisfy the conditions enumerated at the end of appendix [ i - m ] . using the inverse scattering method , one can construct from the sd , ( [ zet1]-[zet3 ] ) , a new @xmath38-parameter family of piecewise continuous potentials which goes to zero at infinity .",
    "the transformation ( [ zet1]-[zet3 ] ) has a simple interpretation .",
    "assume that the imaginary part of @xmath54 is much smaller than its real part , @xmath57 , and the initial reflection coefficients , @xmath58 , are slowly varying on the scale @xmath59 near @xmath60 .",
    "then , the new scattering data ( [ zet1]-[zet3 ] ) have a _ reflection resonance _ of width @xmath59 at @xmath60 . indeed , the phases of the new reflexion coefficients vary by @xmath61 in a small interval of width @xmath62 centered on @xmath60 .    a third type of transformation adds purely imaginary resonances to the reflection coefficients leaving the transmission coefficient unchanged : @xmath63 where @xmath51 is an arbitrary real number .",
    "the new sd will also satisfy the conditions enumerated at the end of appendix [ i - m ] .",
    "the reconstruction of the potential is done exactly as for the second type of transformation .",
    "a sequence of transformations of the second and third type can be written as : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is any polynomial whose zeros are invariant with respect to reflection through the imaginary axis , _ i.e. _ if @xmath54 is a zero , then @xmath66 is also a zero of the polynomial .",
    "such polynomials , normalized by the condition @xmath67 , satisfy @xmath68^*$ ] for real @xmath27 .",

    "thus , @xmath65 is completely determined .",
    "let us assume that we have found a solution of the phase reconstruction problem .",

    "one can obtain from it a solution for which the transmission coefficient has no poles in the upper complex half - plane ( _ i.e. _ no bound states ) .",
    "then , by a sequence of transformations of type ( [ zet1]-[la3 ] ) with suitably chosen parameters one can find a solution for which the reflection to the left coefficient has no poles or zeros in the upper half plane .    we will call this solution of the phase reconstruction problem _ the left reference solution_. the left reference solution s transmission coefficient , @xmath73 , and the reflection to the left coefficient , @xmath74 , are analytic and have no zeros in @xmath75 . in a similar way",
    ", we can define the right reference solution , for which @xmath76 and @xmath77 , are analytic and have no zeros in @xmath75 .",
    "the left and right reference solutions are connected by a transformation of type ( [ lp1]-[lp3 ] ) : @xmath78 here , the polynomial @xmath79 where the zeros of the polynomial @xmath80 coincide ( including multiplicities ) with the poles / zeros of @xmath74 in @xmath75 .",
    "taking into account([ro - r ] ) the polynomials are completely determined .",
    "the reference solutions are in a certain sense the maximally non - symmetric solutions .",
    "indeed , as shown in the next section [ rat ] , the potentials corresponding to the left / right reference solutions are identically zero for @xmath81 / @xmath82 .",
    "other solutions of the phase reconstruction problem can be obtained from the reference ones by adding bound states and reflection resonances with reflectance - preserving transformations of type ( [ lam1]-[la3 ] ) .",
    "the left reference solution s @xmath74 is analytic and has no zeros in @xmath75 .",
    "thus , the logarithm @xmath83 $ ] is also analytic in @xmath75 .",
    "the phase of the left reference solution ( which is equal to the imaginary part of @xmath83 $ ] ) can be obtained from the logarithm of its absolute value ( which is equal to the real part of @xmath83 $ ] ) , using a ( subtracted ) logarithmic dispersion relation ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "we will proceed in a different manner , which is more adequate with the physical context .",
    "the effective mass approximation is valid only for energies within an interval not exceeding several hundred millielectronvolts ( mev ) near the @xmath84 point minimum in the @xmath85 system ( or in the lattice matched @xmath86 systems ) .",
    "thus , two sets of scattering data having the same ( or close ) low and intermediate - energy behavior , but whose exact high - energy behavior is different , can be considered equivalent .",
    "we need a good approximation of the sd in the physically relevant range of energies , which obeys the high - energy constraints set forward in the appendix [ appa ] .",
    "the pad approximation method@xcite is a good framework for that .",
    "an added bonus , which will be apparent in the following section [ rat ] , is the simplification of the calculations needed for recovering the potential .",
    "we start with approximating the input design data for the reflectance by a type ii [ p , p+q+2 ] pad approximant@xcite : @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are polynomials of degrees @xmath90 and , respectively , @xmath91 with @xmath92 since the reflectance must be non - negative and less than 1 for all @xmath93 , the polynomials must satisfy @xmath94 on the positive half - axis .",
    "the second inequality ( [ r_e1 ] ) is strict for all @xmath40 and becomes an equality only for @xmath95 .",
    "this ensures that @xmath96 as it should be in the generic case@xcite .",
    "we can rewrite it in the form @xmath97 where the polynomial @xmath98 for @xmath99 .",
    "the polynomial @xmath100 is normalized by setting @xmath101 finally , the transmittance is approximated by the [ p+q+2,p+q+2 ] pad approximant : @xmath102    we can choose the coefficients of the polynomials in ( [ r_e ] ) as the parameters .",
    "these can be obtained from standard type ii pad fitting routines .",
    "taking into account ( [ r_e1 ] ) with equality at @xmath95 and ( [ r_e3 ] ) , the fit is obtained by solving a system of @xmath103 linear equations with @xmath103 unknowns ( the polynomials coefficients ) , which make the fit exact at @xmath103 chosen points .",
    "thus , the [ p , p+q+2 ] pad ( [ r_e ] ) is fully determined .",
    "( [ r_e4 ] ) does not introduce additional parameters .",
    "as we will see further on , it is advantageous to reparameterize in terms of the zeros and poles of ( [ r_e ] ) . since the reflectance and the transmittance are real and non - negative , the zeros and poles of ( [ r_e ] ) and ( [ r_e4 ] ) are either real negative or come in complex conjugate pairs .",
    "the only exception to this rule are eventual real positive zeros of @xmath100 , which have an even order of degeneracy ( generically = 2 ) .",
    "the heterostructure is transparent to bloch waves ( maximal transmission resonances ) at the energies corresponding to these degenerate zeros .",
    "now , we want to find the left reference solution by solving eq .",
    "( [ refl ] ) , @xmath104 with the reflectance given by ( [ r_e ] ) .",
    "the reflection to the left coefficient , @xmath74 , will be sought as a [ p , p+q+2 ] pad approximant in the variable @xmath27 @xmath105 with the normalization @xmath106 which agrees with ( [ r_e3 ] ) . as mentioned above",
    ", @xmath74 for the left reference solution of ( [ refl- ] ) is analytic in the upper half - plane and has no zeros there .",
    "then , the zeros of both the denominator and numerator of ( [ r- ] ) must lie in the lower complex half - plane .",

    "let us now use ( [ ro - r ] ) to represent all the polynomials involved in the equation ( [ refl- ] ) as products : @xmath110 here @xmath111 and @xmath112 are the zeros of @xmath113 , respectively @xmath100 , while @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the zeros of @xmath116 , respectively @xmath89 .",
    "taking into account the relation ( [ ksq ] ) , @xmath117 , we find the following relations between the zeros of the polynomials : @xmath118 these relations solve the problem up to the ambiguity of the signs of the square roots .",
    "let us show that the reference solution is unique .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the square - root function as maps the complex plane cut along @xmath119 onto the upper complex half - plane , _",
    "i.e. _ if @xmath13 is in the cut plane , then @xmath120 .",
    "since the zeros and poles of the reference solution can not lie in the upper half - plane the sign choices in ( [ p1]-[q1 ] ) are unique@xcite : @xmath121    it remains to show that if @xmath108 is one of the zeros , respectively poles , of ( [ r- ] ) , then @xmath109 is also a zero , respectively pole .",
    "this is obvious if @xmath108 is real@xcite or imaginary .",
    "otherwise , both the real and the imaginary parts of @xmath122 are nonzero .",
    "then , @xmath123 is also a zero ( pole ) of ( [ r_e ] ) , since as noted above these come in complex - conjugate pairs .",
    "but our definition of the square - root function leads to @xmath124    thus , ( [ r- ] ) with the zeros and poles given by ( [ p2]-[q2 ] ) is the unique left reference solution for the reflection to the left coefficient if the reflectance is given by the pad approximant ( [ r_e ] ) .",
    "we can readily recover the complex transmission coefficient of the reference solutions using the same approach .",
    "the ( complex ) transmission coefficient of the reference solution is given by the [ p+q+2,p+q+2 ] ( diagonal ) pad approximant @xmath125 normalized by setting the coefficient of @xmath126 in the polynomial @xmath127 equal to the coefficient of @xmath128 in the already determined polynomial @xmath116 , so that @xmath129 let 0 and @xmath130 be the zeros of the transmittance , ( [ r_e4 ] ) .",
