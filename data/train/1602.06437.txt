    "the search for additional higgses , after the one discovered so far @xcite and the possible evidence of a new ( pseudo)scalar state with mass around 750  gev @xcite , is one of the most important tasks of run 2 of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "it is widely known that extra spinless states with or without standard model ( sm ) quantum numbers can induce sizeable tree - level effects in the couplings of the discovered state , which have been under close scrutiny for three years now .",
    "it is also true that direct searches for new higgs states , as shown by the aforementioned recent preliminary results , could have a dramatic impact on lhc activities .",
    "these two facts seem already remarkable motivations to study the phenomenology of extra higgses at the present cern machine .    despite the obvious far - reaching consequences of a discovery of even a single additional scalar , the presence of another higgs would not be , by itself , an evidence for the naturalness of the weak scale : such a defining situation would still be pending upon the whole subject . just like for the case of a single higgs doublet , for which the hierarchy problem can be explained by its pseudo nambu - goldstone boson ( pngb ) nature",
    ", we would like to link the presence of extra higgs particles to natural theories of the fermi scale .",
    "in particular , we have in mind composite higgs models , where the mass of the lightest higgs state is kept naturally lighter than a new strong scale around @xmath11 tev by an approximate global symmetry @xcite , broken by sm interactions in the _ partial compositeness _",
    "paradigm @xcite .    in the minimal composite higgs model @xcite ,",
    "the only light scalar in the spectrum is a pngb , surrounded by spanned composite resonances roughly heavier by a loop factor .",
    "the underlying symmetries protect the higgs mass from quantum corrections thus giving a simple solution to the hierarchy problem . the only robust way to expect new light ( pseudo)scalars in the spectrum is to make them also pngbs . even in the case",
    "they are not expected to be as light as the sm higgs , it is interesting to find a mechanism for describing all the higgses as pngbs and to explain their mass differences .",
    "last , but not least for importance , in the case of extra higgs doublets with no vacuum expectation value ( vev ) nor couplings to quark and leptons , one could also have the possibility to describe neutral light states as possible composite dark matter candidates @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we aim at identifying among the lightest scalars at least two higgs doublets as this would lead to a composite 2-higgs doublet model ( c2hdm ) @xcite .",
    "the latter represents the simplest natural two higgs doublet alternative to supersymmetry .",
    "the composite higgses arising from a new dynamics at the tev scale ultimately drive the electro - weak ( ew ) symmetry breaking . to include them as pngbs",
    ", one has basically two different and complementary approaches : ( i ) to write down an effective lagrangian ( e.g. , _ a la _ strongly interacting light higgs ( silh ) @xcite ) invariant under sm symmetries for light composite @xmath12 higgses ; ( ii ) to explicitly impose a specific symmetry breaking structure containing multiple pngbs .",
    "we take here the second approach .",
    "in particular , we will study in detail models based on the spontaneous global symmetry breaking of @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "we will focus on their predictions for the structure of the ( pseudo)scalar spectrum and the deviations of their couplings from those of a generic renormalizable elementary 2-higgs doublet model ( e2hdm ) . in the @xmath13 limit the pngb states are in fact identified with the physical higgs states of doublet scalar fields of the e2hdm .",
    "deviations from the e2hdm are parametrized by @xmath14 , with @xmath15 the sm higgs vev .",
    "once the strong sector is integrated out , the pngb higgses , independently of their microscopic origin , are described by a non - linear @xmath16-model associated to the coset .",
    "we construct their effective low - energy lagrangian according to the prescription developed by callan , coleman , wess and zumino ( ccwz ) @xcite , which makes only few specific assumptions about the strong sector , namely , the global symmetries , their pattern of spontaneous breaking and the sources of explicit breaking ( we assume that they come from the couplings of the strong sector with the sm fields ) .",
    "the scalar potential is in the end generated by loop effects and , at the lowest order , is mainly determined by the free parameters associated to the top sector @xcite .    here",
    "we will focus on the unitarity properties of a c2hdm , namely , we will derive the bounds on the parameters of the model by requiring perturbative unitarity to hold at the energies reachable by the lhc . in fact , contrarily to the e2hdm , which is renormalizable ,",
    "the c2hdm is an effective theory .",
    "the pngb nature of the higgses leads to a modification of their couplings to matter with respect to the e2hdm case and , as a consequence , forces to a non - vanishing @xmath17-dependence of the scattering amplitudes .",
    "this means that the c2hdm is not unitary for energies above a critical value or , alternatively said , one needs to consider other new physics contributions ( e.g. , new composite fermions and gauge bosons ) to make the model unitary above that energy scale .",
    "since the fermion content of the model is not playing a role in the present investigation , we will not specify the fermion representation and we will not calculate the higgs potential generated by the radiative corrections .",
    "instead , we will assume the same general form of the higgs potential as in the e2hdm with a @xmath4 symmetry , the latter imposed in order to avoid flavor changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) at the tree level  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the energy region where the e2hdm and c2hdm are both unitary , it is interesting to compare the bounds on the additional higgs masses .",
    "in fact , due to a compensation amongst mass- and energy - dependent contributions , we find that regions not allowed in the e2hdm are instead permitted in the c2hdm for the most general configuration of their parameter spaces .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the c2hdm based on @xmath18 .",
    "we separately discuss two scenarios : the active one in which both higgs doublet fields acquire a vev and the inert one in which only one does . in section",
    "iii , the unitarity properties of the c2hdm are discussed by calculating all the 2-to-2-body ( pseudo)scalar boson scattering amplitudes and by deriving constraints through all these channels .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section  iv .",
    "some technical details of the derivation of the pngb kinetic terms are given in appendix a.",
    "we first discuss how we obtain two isospin scalar doublets from the spontaneous breakdown of the global symmetry , i.e. , @xmath0 . in order to clarify this ,",
    "we introduce the following fifteen @xmath19 generators : @xmath20 ,   \\notag\\\\ & t_s= -\\frac{i}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\delta_i^5\\delta_j^6-\\delta_j^5\\delta_i^6 ) , \\notag\\\\   & t_1^{\\hat{a } } = -\\frac{i}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\delta^{\\hat{a}}_i \\delta^5_j - \\delta^{\\hat{a}}_j \\delta^5_i ) , \\quad   t_2^{\\hat{a } } = -\\frac{i}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\delta^{\\hat{a}}_i \\delta^6_j - \\delta^{\\hat{a}}_j \\delta^6_i ) , \\notag\\\\ & \\text{with}~~(a , b , c=1\\text{-}3),~~(i , j=1\\text{-}6),~~(\\hat{a}=1\\text{-}4 ) .    \\label{so6_gen}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the above generators are classified into the seven unbroken generators @xmath21 and @xmath22 and the eight broken generators @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "we can confirm that @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the subalgebras which generate the @xmath25 subgroup by looking at the following commutation relations : @xmath26 = i\\epsilon^{abc}t_l^c,\\quad   [ t_r^a , t_r^b ] = i\\epsilon^{abc}t_r^c,\\quad   [ t_l^a , t_r^b ] = [ t_l^a , t_s ] = [ t_r^a , t_s]=0 ,   \\label{xx } \\\\ & [ t_l^a , t_{\\phi_\\alpha } ] = -\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^a t_{\\phi_\\alpha},\\quad   [ t_r^3,t_{\\phi_\\alpha } ] = -\\frac{1}{2 } t_{\\phi_\\alpha } , \\label{yy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 eq .  ( [ xx ] ) tells us that the commutation relations among @xmath21 and @xmath22 are closed plus that @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) generates the @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) subgroup of @xmath32 which is identified as the custodial symmetry of the sm higgs sector .",
    "furthermore , eq .  ( [ yy ] ) shows that @xmath33 transforms as the @xmath30 doublet with charge @xmath34 charge should be + 1/2 to get @xmath35 and @xmath36 for the upper component of the higgs doublet . ] .",
    "therefore the broken generators are associated with the pngbs , transforming as a ( * 4*,*2 * ) of @xmath25 .",
    "we then introduce the following two @xmath30 doublet scalar fields associated with @xmath33 as pngbs : @xmath37 where the @xmath38 s are the vevs of @xmath39 .",
    "the relation among @xmath40 , @xmath41 and the fermi constant @xmath42 will be discussed in section  ii - b .",
    "notice that , in order to assign the right hypercharge to fermions , one has to introduce also an extra @xmath43 . the electric charge @xmath44 will be then defined as usual by @xmath45 with the hypercharge @xmath46 given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the @xmath43 charge . in this paper , we do not discuss the fermion sector which is not relevant to the following analysis , so we can omit to include this extra @xmath43 group .      in general , once the coset space has been chosen , the low - energy lagrangian is fixed at the two - derivative level , the basic ingredient being the pngb matrix which transforms non - linearly under the global group .",
    "the kinetic lagrangian invariant under the @xmath19 symmetry can be constructed by the analogue of the construction in non - linear sigma models developed in @xcite , as @xmath49 where @xmath50 here",
    "@xmath51 is the pngb matrix : @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( [ ccwz2 ] ) , the covariant derivative @xmath53 is given by @xmath54 the expressions for @xmath55 up to @xmath56 are given in appendix  a.    in order to see how the gauge boson masses are generated , let us consider the fourth components of the higgs fields : @xmath57 with @xmath58 in this case , the matrix @xmath51 defined in eq .",
    "( [ u6 ] ) takes a simple form , @xmath59 where @xmath60 the 2-gauge boson terms are extracted from eqs .",
    "( [ ccwz1 ] ) , ( [ ccwz2 ] ) and ( [ u62 ] ) as @xmath61 and thus the gauge boson masses are given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 with @xmath65 being the weak mixing angle .",
    "notice here that the vev @xmath66 is different from the one @xmath67 in the sm as long as we take a finite value of @xmath1 .",
    "the relationship among @xmath66 , @xmath68 and @xmath42 is expressed as follows @xmath69 the ratio of the two vevs is defined by @xmath70 .",
    "similarly to the e2hdm , we can define the so - called higgs basis  @xcite in which only one of the two doublet fields contains the vev @xmath66 and the nambu - goldstone states @xmath71 and @xmath72 absorbed into the longitudinal components of @xmath73 and @xmath74 bosons , respectively : @xmath75 where @xmath76 in the above expressions , @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the physical charged and cp - odd neutral higgs boson , respectively , while @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the cp - even higgs bosons which in general can be mixed with each other . in this basis , the two - derivative terms for scalar bosons are extracted up to @xmath81 : @xmath82 where @xmath83 we see that the kinetic terms for @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath80 are not in canonical form and we need to rescale the fields : @xmath84 after this shift , we can define the mass eigenstates for the cp - even scalar bosons by introducing the mixing angle @xmath85 as : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is assumed to be the observed higgs boson with a mass of 125 gev .",
    "the mixing angle @xmath85 is determined by the mass matrix for the cp - even states calculated from the higgs potential , which will be discussed in the next subsection .",
    "the higgs potential is generated through the coleman - weinberg ( cw ) mechanism  @xcite at loop levels .",
    "there are two types of contributions to the potential , coming from gauge boson loops and fermion loops .",
    "the former contribution can be calculated without any ambiguities and it generates a positive squared mass term in the potential  @xcite .",
    "thus , ew symmetry breaking does not occur by the gauge loops alone .",
    "fermion loops can provide a negative contribution to the squared mass term , so their effect is essentially important to trigger ew symmetry breaking .",
    "however , the contribution from fermion loops depends on the choice of the representation of fermions .",
    "the structure of the higgs potential in the @xmath18 model has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite assuming several representations of fermion fields .",
    "they also assume that the explicit breaking of the global symmetry is associated with the couplings of the strong sector to the sm fields , that is , gauge and yukawa interactions .",
    "this assumption , dictated by minimality , allows one to parameterize the higgs potential , at each given order in the fermion and gauge couplings , in terms of a limited number of coefficients .",
    "if this assumption is relaxed , the parameter space of the c2hdm could be significantly enlarged .",
    "the form of the potential they obtain is given by the general e2hdm one , but each of the parameters is expressed in terms of those in the strong sector ( mainly associated to the top dynamics ) . in our paper , however , we do not explicitly calculate the cw potential and we do not specify the fermion representations , making our analysis applicable to different choices of them .",
    "in fact , while the coupling of the vector bosons is fixed by gauge invariance , more freedom exists in the fermion sector and , to specify the model , one must fix the quantum numbers of the strong sector operators which mix with the sm fermions , in particular with the top quark .",
    "the cw potential clearly depends on these choices . instead of performing the explicit calculation ,",
    "we assume here the same form of the higgs potential as that in the e2hdm .",
    "our results on the unitarity properties of the c2hdm will be expressed as bounds on the masses of the higgses which are free parameters in the e2hdm .",
    "once explicitly specified the model , we will have the possibility to check , by calculating the cw potential , if the composite higgs spectrum of that particular configuration satisfies the unitarity bounds .    in order to avoid fcncs at the tree level",
    ", a discrete @xmath4 symmetry  @xcite is often imposed onto the potential , which is what we also do here symmetry ( @xmath88 and @xmath89 ) is referred as the @xmath90 symmetry whose transformation can be expressed by a diagonal @xmath91 matrix form acting on the @xmath91 pngb matrix given in eq .",
    "( [ u6 ] ) . ] . under the @xmath4 symmetry ,",
    "the two doublet fields are transformed as @xmath92 .",
    "this symmetry can also avoid a large contribution to the ew @xmath93-parameter which could emerge in c2hdms from the dimension 6 operator in the kinetic lagrangian - parameter and to fcncs in c2hdms is faced also in @xcite where they discuss @xmath93-safe models based on different cosets , in particular so(9)/so(8 ) . ] .",
    "depending on the nature of the @xmath4 symmetry , i.e. , softly - broken or unbroken , the properties of the higgs bosons can drastically change . in the following ,",
    "we first discuss the softly - broken @xmath4 case and then we consider the unbroken case . for the latter case , the vev of @xmath94 must be taken to be zero to avoid the spontaneously breakdown of the @xmath4 symmetry . in analogy with the e2hdm",
    "we will refer to the former scenario as the active c2hdm , while the latter describes the inert c2hdm .",
