    "the new particle recently observed at around 125 gev at lhc @xcite has properties consistent with the standard model higgs boson .",
    "more precise measurements of its couplings will provide detailed information on the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "an impressive effort in the community is made to test the nature of the resonance  @xcite , whether is composite or fundamental , or even testing its scalar properties  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we assume that the discovered resonance is a _ fundamental _",
    "scalar , and ( at least partly ) responsible for ewsb .",
    "our objective is to show how lep indirect data , and now lhc direct higgs measurements are shaping our understanding of new physics from the so - far only resonance uncovered at the lhc , which we call `` the higgs '' below .",
    "we now proceed to set the notation used in the paper , from the higgs sector to the basis of effective operators adopted thorough paper .    in the sm , the higgs particle @xmath0 forms part of a @xmath1 doublet , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the vacuum expectation value of the neutral part of the doublet .",
    "the term in the lagrangian responsible for the gauge bosons masses is @xmath4 here the covariant derivative is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 are the pauli matrices , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the @xmath1 and @xmath9 gauge couplings respectively , and the corresponding gauge fields @xmath10 are @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "ewsb gives rise at the same time to the generation of the weak gauge boson masses and to their couplings @xmath13 , @xmath14 where we have defined the fields @xmath15 . in eq.([sm ] ) , valid at tree - level , we appreciate the presence of the custodial symmetry : in the limit @xmath16 , the masses of the three weak gauge bosons are equal , and the couplings to the higgs are identical .",
    "since the ewsb mechanism is at the origin of the mass of @xmath17 and @xmath18 and at the same time determines the couplings of the higgs to them , the study of the couplings of the higgs to electroweak bosons is expected to shed light on the ewsb mechanism . with this in mind , in this paper we deal with the coupling of the higgs to electroweak bosons . along the same philosophy",
    ", we are not considering anomalous coupling of the higgs with the gluon @xmath19 .",
    "this is a simplification , but also motivated by the tight direct bounds on strong production from the lhc .",
    "new physics able to modify the @xmath20 coupling would be necessarily charged under @xmath21 .",
    "an example would be a new heavy color triplet , such as the stop in supersymmetry .",
    "this colored particle would have an important effect in the higgs couplings to both gluons and photons , and their effect is very correlated such that the stop effect can be rephrased in terms of higher order operators  @xcite .",
    "as we said , in this paper we assume that the particle observed at lhc at 125 gev is the fundamental higgs particle @xmath0 , but we also suppose that there is new physics at higher energies which might induce some relatively small changes in the @xmath0 properties .",
    "specifically , we will concentrate on the @xmath13 couplings which are not of the form shown in ( [ sm ] ) .",
    "we will also assume that the effects beyond the sm can be described in terms of effective lagrangians valid up to a high - energy scale @xmath22 .",
    "how heavy has to be the new physics to fall into this analysis , based on effective operators ?",
    "all processes concerning the higgs at the lhc have relatively small energy exchange .",
    "for example , in the dominating production mechanism , gluon fusion , one can write the factorization _ prod ( g g h ) ( h gg ) ( -m_h^2 ) which is just based on the narrow width approximation  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in higgs production through gluon fusion , the typical exchange in momentum is @xmath23 , and new physics at a scale @xmath24 would lead to a sensible effective theory .",
    "the same reasoning follows for other production mechanisms , such as vector bosons fusion or associated production .",
    "let us consider the effective lagrangian _ eff = _ i _ i [ leff ] with the subset of operators @xmath25 which modify the @xmath13 vertices  .",
    "these operators have been investigated by @xcite before the lhc discovery , and by @xcite after the higgs discovery .",
    "the operators @xmath25 are dimension - six and thus they are suppressed by a high - energy scale @xmath22 . throughout our paper",
    "we use the convention and notations which were used in @xcite .",
    "the list of operators is not long .",
    "we start with operators containing the scalar field @xmath26 and its derivative .",
    "there is a first operator which breaks custodial symmetry at tree - level , @xmath27 and there are two which preserve it  ) , with a suitable parameter @xmath28 ; see ref .",
    ", @xmath29    the list continues with five operators involving the scalar field and the field strengths @xmath30 in this paper , we use the re - scaled field stregths @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "there is a first operator that contributes at tree - level to the @xmath33 mixing , @xmath34 and four other operators @xmath35    let us now discuss which operators we will consider in our paper .",
    "first , the two operators ( [ ophi1 ] ) and ( [ obw ] ) have tree level effect on precision electroweak observables and therefore are subject to very strict constraints . due to this reason , we will not consider them : the lhc is not providing more information on those operators .",
    "second , the operators ( [ ophi2 ] ) and ( [ ophi4 ] ) affect the @xmath13 couplings through a higgs field renormalization , so that the induced effect have the same form than in ( [ sm ] ) , namely it is of the form @xmath36 and @xmath37",
    ". such normalization effects will be rather hard to extract in the near future  , so we will not consider these two operators here . in summary , in this paper we will work out the consequences of the four operators @xmath38 , contributing to @xmath39 in ( [ leff ] ) when added to the sm lagrangian , with a total lagrangian @xmath40",
    "the four operators ( [ ow ] ) - ( [ obb ] ) contribute to precision electroweak observables measured for example at lep and at tevatron .",
    "the observed experimental values severely constrain the presence of those operators .",
    "let us start with data coming from measurements of @xmath18-pole observables , @xmath17-mass , and low energy experiments .",
    "the standard way to proceed is to use the @xmath41 , and @xmath42 parameters to find the bounds .",
    "the operators we are considering contribute at the one - loop level to @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .",
    "the corresponding expressions have been calculated in @xcite .",
    "they read s = & \\ { & 3   + & & +  2   + & & -   + & & -  24   } [ expressions ]    t =   & \\ { & _ b   + & & +    + & & +    } [ expressiont ]    u =   s^2  & \\ { &   + & & +   } [ expressionu ] here we have defined @xmath43 for @xmath44 .",
    "the quantities @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are @xmath48 couplings . to have limits on the @xmath49 using @xmath50 in ( [ expressions]-[expressionu ] ) we need to specify the value of @xmath22 in the logarithm ; we shall use @xmath51 tev .",
    "changing the value of @xmath22 does not change very much the limits we shall find on the different @xmath49 ; in fact , as we increase @xmath22 , the limits on @xmath49 tighten .",
    "the presence of the logarithm is because our operators affect @xmath50 at a one - loop order .",
    "as we will see , the induced @xmath49 for observables at lhc are at tree - level and do not have such logarithm of @xmath22 .    the adimensional parameters @xmath49 encode the strength coefficient @xmath52 of the operators as well as the ratio among the fermi scale @xmath3 and the new physics scale @xmath22 .",
    "an alternative , which is also used in the current literature , would be to specify the scale @xmath22 and show the limits on @xmath52 .",
    "if one chooses @xmath51 tev , any limit on a specific @xmath49 shown in our paper translates into a limit on the corresponding @xmath52 given by @xmath53 .",
    "we stress that the loops contributing to @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , as well as to the other observables contain quadratic divergences which cancel because we are using an effective lagrangian that contains gauge - invariant operators  @xcite .",
    "only the logarithmic terms remain ; we have kept only this logarithmic part of the calculation and not the constant terms .",
    "let us now move to the physics of the triple gauge - boson vertices @xmath54 , since the operators @xmath55 and @xmath56 have contributions at tree level , and therefore lep2 measurements can constrain them . in the presence of these two operators",
    "the relevant part of the total lagrangian ( [ ltotal ] ) contains three parameters , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 @xmath60 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + i e    \\ , [    \\ , ( w^-_{\\mu\\nu } w^{+ \\ , \\mu }     - w^+_{\\mu\\nu } w^-_{\\mu } ) a^{\\nu }     +   ( 1 + \\delta \\kappa_\\gamma ) \\ , w_\\mu^- w_\\nu^+ a^{\\mu\\nu }   ]   \\label{wwv}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined the field strengths corresponding to the abelian part , @xmath61 with @xmath62 .",
    "the deviations from the standard model due to the new parameters are given by @xcite @xmath63      to bound each operator we first use the recent limits found by erler @xcite on the electroweak parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the result of the fit to electrowek data for @xmath64 gev is @xmath65    imposing these experimental limits to each operator separately , i.e. , not allowing for cancellations between differents operators , and working at 95%cl , we obtain @xmath66 actually , it is @xmath67 and @xmath68 which restrict the @xmath49 parameters , with @xmath42 not playing a role .",
    "indeed , one expects the new physics effect on @xmath42 to be suppressed @xcite by @xmath69 respect to @xmath68 .",
    "now we would like to find the analogous bounds coming from @xmath54 data .",
    "we use the lep2 experimental limits on @xmath70 and @xmath59 as compiled by the pdg @xcite , @xmath71 we should stress that each of these bounds is obtained setting the other two parameters to their sm values , i.e. equal to zero . strictly speaking , the way these limits",
    "are extracted do not lead rigorously to individual bounds on @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "for example , if we wish to get a limit on @xmath72 with @xmath74 , we should allow the three parameters in ( [ g1z])-([kg ] ) to be non zero , in the proportions indicated by the equations and then compare with experiment .",
    "however , there is a way out to this problem .",
    "since the experimental bound on @xmath57 leads to the tightest constraint , and this depends only on @xmath72 , it is a very good approximation to neglect @xmath72 in ( [ kz ] ) and ( [ kg ] ) .",
    "actually , when we make this approximation , we realize that ( [ expkg ] ) is more constraining than ( [ expkz ] ) , so we can use only the limit coming from ( [ expkg ] ) . with these approximations",
    ", we can get bounds on the strength of the effective operators .",
    "working at 95%cl , we obtain @xmath75    we finally stress that lhc is also providing experimental data @xcite on the @xmath54 vertices which in the future may be competitive with the old lep2 data we use here .",
    "although we do not expect fine tuned cancellations among the contributions of different operators , it is interesting to see what happens when we consider two operators at the same time . since the structure of the operators @xmath55 and",
    "@xmath56 is very similar we shall consider the situation where they are both generated by new physics existing at higher energy scales and investigate the bounds coming from precision electroweak physics , including lep2 .",
    "for the same reasons we shall also consider the case where we have the simultaneous effects of @xmath76 and @xmath77 . in secs .",
    "[ ghazsec ] and  [ toy ] , we will provide examples of this common generation in the case of supersymmetry and extra - dimensions .    for this exercise we shall use the lep2 data , eqs .",

    "as expected , the contours in @xmath80 are ellipses .",
    "however , the contours in the plane @xmath81 are stripes because the corresponding operators on the one hand do no modify the @xmath54 vertices , and on the other hand they are custodial preserving , and thus there is a single constraint coming from the @xmath67 parameter .     and @xmath81 .",

    "the situation for staus is more promising , provided the staus have a large lr mixing . in this limit",
    "the induced coupling can be estimated as g_haz^(2 ) ( ) - ( ) ^2 where @xmath154 is the lightest stau , and @xmath155 is the off - diagonal mass term , @xmath156 , and we have taken the limit in the loop integrals of heavy stau .",
    "the limit on the anomalous coupling can then be translated in m_lr 30 m _ _  .    by going through this exercise",
    ", we see that the current dataset it not sensitive to charginos and charged higgs via the indirect probes we are discussing here  @xcite . in the case of the stau",
    ", the sensitivity depends largely on the amount of mixing between the two staus . but note that a large @xmath157 means that there would be a large gap between the two stau physical states , possibly getting into the dangerous region of charge breaking minima if @xmath1580 .",
    "as a final illustration of the effect of the bounds on effective operators on uv models , we use the example of a radion in warped extra - dimensions .",
    "we follow closely the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the coupling of the radion @xmath159 to massless gauge fields is loop induced and given by ( w^ w _ + b^ b _ ) [ radionff ] where we are neglecting the localized kinetic terms and trace anomalies . here",
    "@xmath160 in the usual randall - sundrum ( rs ) model , but can be smaller in the little randall - sundrum ( lrs )  @xcite .",
    "for example , with a cutoff of order 100 tev , one would expect @xmath161 . note that after ewsb , this coupling receives an extra contribution , suppressed by order the effective volume of the extra - dimension , i.e. @xmath162 .",
    "assuming there is no higgs - curvature mixing , and that the higgs is localized on the ir brane , the coupling of the radion to the higgs would be given by m_h^2 ^    integrating out the heavy radion , leads to the effective operator _",
    "bb - ( 2 ) ^2 = _ ww    the typical energies at which we are probing those anomalous couplings are @xmath23 , hence in our expansion of the radion dynamics , we are neglecting terms of order @xmath163 . in fig .",
    "[ radion ] , we present the limit in terms of @xmath164 , for the rs ( lrs ) model .",
    "the current limit on @xmath165 is about 700 ( 1100 ) gev , barring possible tuning into the tiny region at low mass .     for the bulk rs with @xmath166=30 ( blue - solid line ) and lrs ( @xmath167 ) ( red - dashed line ) . _ _ ]    note that the radion could also couple to the gluon , and modify the higgs production mechanism .",
    "however , for @xmath168 , the trace anomaly becomes an important contribution , and the coupling is modified by @xmath169 . here",
    "@xmath170 is the total beta function of order ( 1 - 10 ) , depending on the localization of colored fields in the extra - dimension . in this case , a partial cancellation in the radion coupling to gluons is conceivable , and could reduce its effect on the gluon fusion process .",
    "in this section we look ahead into the end of the year s run , and how the full dataset would affect the results presented in this paper . lacking a crystal ball",
    ", we must introduce some theoretical bias .",
    "our choice is to assume that the central values on the signal strengths @xmath90 will move towards the sm expected values , i.e. we shall set @xmath171 .",
    "moreover , we will estimate that the error bars would go down by a factor of two , assuming a total of 30@xmath138 fb of data .",
    "this is most probably a very optimistic estimate , as some of the signal strengths are not lying around the sm value , and in migrating towards it , the errors are not expected to scale so quickly .",
    "nevertheless , this exercise allows us to illustrate the impact of more precise data in the current analysis .    the effect on the @xmath172 is minimal , as we display in fig .",
    "[ epstot]a .",
    "as the central values on @xmath126 and @xmath127 channels move towards the sm , the reduction of the error bars is barely affecting the global fit .",
    "the situation for the @xmath129 is more encouraging . in fig .",
    "[ prospects - fig]a we show the improvement in the fit , and in fig .",
    "[ prospects - fig]b , the improvement on the limits on @xmath173 , both a factor @xmath174(1.5 - 2 ) .",
    "in this paper we have taken the approach that the higgs candidate is an elementary scalar and that the leading effects of new physics appear at the level of dimension - six effective operators .",
    "we focused on four operators which affect the couplings to electroweak gauge bosons , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath175 , to constrain deviations from the sm behavior , which we named @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "we started by looking at constraints from lep1 ( and low energy electroweak data ) and lep2 , which are especially restrictive for the @xmath121 operators .",
    "after lhc data is taken into account , limits on @xmath121 do not improve significantly , and we expect no sizeable improvement with the full 2012 dataset .    on the other hand , the operators @xmath122 , poorly constrained by lep data , contribute to the higgs to two photon coupling .",
    "the sensitivity with the current lhc data is better than lep by a factor @xmath105 . with more lhc data coming , we estimate those limits will improve by a factor of around two .",
    "we studied the impact of non - standard lorentz structures in the coupling of the higgs to @xmath108 .",
    "as the @xmath97 experimental analysis makes use of angular correlations between the two leptons in the @xmath17 decays , one could expect a modification of the efficiency to the cut on dilepton azimuthal angle .",
    "we found the effect is negligible , something one can qualitatively understand by realizing that the higgs would predominantly produce parallel leptons .",
    "we then performed a combined fit to lep and lhc data , with no significant changes respect to what we have already obtained using the individual channels .",
    "namely , limits on @xmath121 driven by lep , whereas @xmath122 is mostly determined by the lhc gamma - gamma signal .",
    "one particularly interesting anomalous coupling is the rare decay @xmath176 .",
    "both sets of operators can induce this coupling .",
    "we show that the limits on the decay width are at least an order of magnitude larger than the sm prediction .",
    "we then interpreted the limits in supersymmetry with light electroweak states , charged higgses , charginos and staus , to find that this dataset is only sensitive to staus , possibly with large mixing .",
    "besides supersymmetry , extra - dimensional scenarions are a possible source of these operators .",
    "we have discussed the effect of the exchange of a massive radion , and set limits in terms of its mass and scale of interaction of the order of the tev .",
