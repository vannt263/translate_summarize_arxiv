    "first , it must be emphasized that , because we did not fit all the wave function parameters including @xmath42 and @xmath43 in a single search , it is very possible that a good solution with a smaller d - state exists ( and we think this is quite likely ) .",
    "so , without a systematic @xmath200 fit , we do not know precisely how large a d - state probability is required by the data . here",
    "we present evidence of a large d - state . for comparison , note that the d - state probability in @xmath201h varies from about 7 - 9% , depending on the nn force model used ( see table v in ref .",
    "@xcite , for example ) and at least four times smaller than our estimate .",
    "( the p state probability in @xmath201h is also quire small , less than 0.16% ; if this were also increased by the same factor of four as the d - state , it would compare with our result for the nucleon . ) in the three nucleon bound state the d - state arises primarily from the large tensor force which is a feature of the one pion exchange ( ope ) part of the nn potential . if the force between two quarks is described by a combination of one gluon exchange ( oge ) and a confining interaction ( and/or ope , as some models suggest ) , and the confining interaction is a mixture of scalar and vector components , then a tensor force can arise from both the oge and the vector part of the confining interaction @xcite .",
    "it may be that this mechanism can produce a large d - state , but isgur , karl , and koniuk @xcite , using the harmonic oscillator model of isgur and karl @xcite find a very much smaller value .",
    "on the other hand , our findings are in line with the results of refs .",
    "@xcite on the importance of higher orbital angular momentum components in the baryon spectrum , affecting the nucleon mass by about 100 mev , and producing inversion of the relative positions of positive and negative parity nucleonic excitations ( unfortunately the breaking down of the contributions from each of the different partial waves included in those calculations was not reported ) .",
    "all that we can say here is that a large d - state can explain the dis observations .",
    "a dynamical calculation is needed to determine whether or not a large d - state is possible .",
    "if the correct explanation of the dis data is closer to solution 1 with the expected p - state and a much smaller d - state , then spin puzzle is easily explained by a nucleon wave function with modest angular momentum components .",
