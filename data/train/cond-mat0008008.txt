    "the electronic properties of one - dimensional ( 1d ) metals have attracted considerable attention for fifty years by now . starting with the work of tomonaga in 1950 @xcite and later by luttinger @xcite ,",
    "it has become clear that the electron - electron interaction destroys the sharp fermi surface and leads to a breakdown of the ubiquituous fermi liquid theory pioneered by landau @xcite .",
    "this breakdown is signalled by a vanishing quasiparticle weight @xmath1 in the presence of arbitrarily weak interactions .",
    "the resulting non - fermi liquid state is commonly called luttinger liquid ( ll ) , or sometimes tomonaga - luttinger liquid .",
    "the name `` luttinger liquid '' was coined by haldane @xcite to describe the universal low - energy properties of one - dimensional conductors .",
    "universality means that the physical properties do not depend on details of the model , the interaction potential , etc . , but instead are only characterized by a few parameters ( critical exponents ) .",
    "the range of validity of the ll model is usually set by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is an electronic bandwidth parameter and @xmath4 is the relevant energy scale , namely either the thermal scale @xmath5 or the applied voltage @xmath6 .",
    "quite remarkably , the ll concept is believed to hold for arbitrary statistical properties of the particles , e.g.  both for fermions and bosons .",
    "it provides a paradigm for non - fermi liquid physics and may have some relevance also for higher - dimensional systems , e.g.  in relation to high - temperature superconductivity .    in the model studied by tomonaga and luttinger , a special dispersion relation for the noninteracting problem",
    "was assumed , where one linearizes around the two fermi vectors @xmath7 present in 1d . at sufficiently low energy scales ,",
    "such a procedure should clearly be possible .",
    "in fact , we will see below that in a nanotube the dispersion relation is highly linear anyways . assuming a linear dispersion relation composed of left- and right - moving particles with fermi velocity @xmath8",
    ", one can equivalently express the noninteracting problem in terms of collective plasmon ( density wave ) excitations .",
    "technically , in the `` bosonization '' language @xcite , for the simplest case of a spinless single - channel system , these bosonic excitations can be expressed in terms of a displacement field @xmath9 such that the density fluctuations are @xmath10 .",
    "electron - electron interactions then describe a bilinear coupling of these density fluctuations , and therefore the full interacting problem can be written as a free theory in the displacement field : @xmath11 ^ 2 \\right ) \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the canonical momentum to the field @xmath9 . in the long - wavelength limit , one can approximate the fourier transform @xmath13 of the 1d interaction potential by a constant @xmath14 , and the dimensionless @xmath0 parameter in eq .",
    "( [ h1 ] ) is given by @xmath15^{-1/2 } \\;.\\ ] ] note that for repulsive interactions we always have @xmath16 , with small @xmath0 meaning strong interactions .",
    "the limit @xmath17 describes the fermi gas ( _ not_a fermi liquid ) , and the limit @xmath18 leads to a classical wigner crystal . the model ( [ h1 ] ) is equivalent to a set of harmonic oscillators and can therefore be solved exactly .",
    "the physical interpretation can be elucidated by the use of the bosonization formula for the electron operator itself @xcite .",
    "thereby , the creation operator for a right- or left - moving electron ( @xmath19 ) can be written in the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a lattice constant . using this expression ,",
    "it is a simple matter to show that the sharp @xmath22 fermi surface is smeared out for @xmath16 , with interaction - dependent power laws close to @xmath23 .",
    "physically , this is because the electron is an unstable particle and spontaneously decays into collective plasmon modes . including the spin-1/2 degree of freedom",
    ", one finds that the spin and charge plasmons also decouple and moreover propagate with different velocities @xmath24 .",
    "this phenomenon is called _ spin - charge separation _ and implies that the spin and charge degrees of freedom of an electron brought into a ll will spatially separate .",
    "note that in a fermi liquid @xmath25 and therefore this characteristic feature will not show up .",
    "spin - charge separation is intrinsically a dynamical phenomenon outside the scope of thermodynamics .",
    "an interesting and closely related issue concerns the fractionalized stable excitations of the ll .",
    "while it is easy to establish the spin - charge separation phenomenon in the bosonic plasmon basis , the nature of the expected fundamental `` quasiparticles '' with fractional statistics , similar to the famous laughlin quasiparticles in the fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) effect , is less clear . in a 1d hubbard chain , which is known to be a realization of the ll at low temperatures , well - defined spinon and holon",
    "excitations exist . for a spinless system",
    ", one can establish that quasiparticles scattered by a weak impurity potential have fractional charge @xmath26 and a statistical angle @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the fractional charge can have _ any _  even irrational  value .",
    "furthermore , for the topology of a ll on a ring , a complete characterization of the universal ll theory in terms of fractional - statistics quasiparticles has been provided recently @xcite .    in view of this discussion , it is understandable that , for many decades , experimentalists have attempted to find ll behavior . in the 1970s , the key interest was focused on quasi-1d organic chain compounds @xcite , where ll behavior is hard to establish because of complicated 1d-3d crossover phenomena and additional phase transitions into other states .",
    "the interest was revived a few years ago , when experimental observations of ll behavior for transport in semiconductor quantum wires @xcite and for edge states in fqh bars @xcite were reported . shortly after the theoretical prediction of ll behavior in metallic carbon nanotubes @xcite ,",
    "the to - date perhaps cleanest experimental observations of ll behavior were established in transport experiments for single - wall nanotubes ( swnts ) @xcite . the theory along with the experiments of ref .",
    "@xcite will be presented below . by now , there are also several other theoretical proposals for probing the ll state in _ bulk _  systems , e.g.  by investigating the tunneling density of states ( tdos ) of a 3d metal in an ultra - strong magnetic field @xcite , or by studying 2d arrays of regularly stacked nanotubes @xcite .",
    "carbon nanotubes were discovered in 1991 by iijima @xcite and have enjoyed exponentially increasing interest since then .",
    "the current status of the field has been summarized in a recent physics world issue @xcite , see also ref .",
    "@xcite . ignoring the end structure",
    ", one may think of a swnt as a graphene sheet , i.e.  a 2d honeycomb lattice made up of c atoms , that is wrapped onto a cylinder , with typical radius of order 1 - 2 nm and length of several microns . depending on the helicity of the wrapping ,",
    "the resulting swnt is either semiconducting or metallic . in our experimental setup",
    "discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , these two behaviors can be distinguished as follows . when the conductance @xmath28 of the tube is measured as a function of a gate voltage @xmath29",
    ", @xmath28 is virtually independent of @xmath29 for metal tubes , while @xmath28 varies exponentially with @xmath29 for semiconducting tubes .",
    "the discussion in this paper is limited to transport through _ metallic _ swnts , where ll behavior can be expected .",
    "@xmath30from the special band structure of a graphene sheet @xcite , one arrives at the characteristic dispersion relation of a metallic swnt shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "this band structure exhibits two fermi points @xmath31 with a right- and a left - moving ( @xmath19 ) branch around each fermi point .",
    "these branches are highly linear with fermi velocity @xmath32 m / s .",
    "the r- and l - movers arise as linear combinations of the @xmath33 sublattice states reflecting the two c atoms in the basis of the honeycomb lattice .",
    "the dispersion relation depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] holds for energy scales @xmath34 , with the bandwidth cutoff scale @xmath35 for tube radius @xmath36 . for typical swnts",
    ", @xmath3 will be of the order 1  ev .",
    "the large overall energy scale together with the structural stability of swnts explain their unique potential for revealing ll physics .",
    "in contrast to conventional systems , e.g.  semiconductor quantum wires , ll effects in swnts are not restricted to the mev range but may even be seen at room temperature .",
    "an additional advantage is that the approximation introduced by linearizing the dispersion relation in conventional 1d systems is here provided by nature in an essentially exact way . a basic prerequisite of the theory @xcite is the _ ballistic _ nature of transport in swnts .",
    "ballistic transport in swnts can be unambiguously established by various experiments , see below and ref .",
    "theoretical analysis @xcite has also suggested the absence of a diffusive phase in swnts , with the possibility of ballistic transport over distances of several @xmath37 m .",
    "schematic bandstructure of a metallic swnt .",
    "a right- and left - moving branch ( @xmath38 ) is found near each of the two fermi points @xmath39 with @xmath31 , corresponding to @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "right- and left - movers arise as linear combinations of the sublattices @xmath33 .",
    "the fermi energy ( dashed line ) is shifted away from neutrality by doping and/or external gates . ]    besides swnts , ll effects have also been observed in the tdos of multi - wall nanotubes ( mwnts ) @xcite .",
    "mwnts are composed of several concentrically arranged graphene shells , and under the assumption of ballistic transport , the only incomplete screening does not spoil the ll behavior @xcite . on the other hand , transport in mwnts",
    "has typical signatures of _ diffusive _ transport @xcite , and the theoretical situation must be regarded as unsettled at the moment .",
    "we shall therefore only discuss ( metallic ) swnts in this review .",
    "the structure of the article is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , the theoretical description of a metallic swnt in the ballistic limit is reviewed , where we focus on the low - energy regime @xmath42 .",
    "we shall derive the scaling forms of the nonlinear @xmath43 characteristics for bulk or end tunneling into a nanotube , and point to various experimental setups that can detect correlation effects in the transport .",
    "we shall also briefly outline a recent suggestion for a spin - transport experiment that could allow for the experimental verification of spin - charge separation . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , the experimental evidence for ll behavior found so far is reviewed .",
    "finally , in sec .  [ sec4 ] , we summarize and discuss some of the open problems that we are aware of .",
    "the remarkable electronic properties of carbon nanotubes are due to the special bandstructure of the @xmath44 electrons in graphene .",
    "there are only two linearly independent fermi points @xmath45 with @xmath31 instead of a continuous fermi surface .",
    "up to energy scales @xmath46 ev , the dispersion relation around the fermi points is , to a very good approximation , linear . since the basis of the honeycomb lattice contains two atoms , there are two sublattices @xmath33 , and hence two degenerate bloch states @xmath47 at each fermi point @xmath31 . here",
    "@xmath48 lives on the sublattice @xmath49 under consideration , and we have already anticipated the correct normalization for nanotubes .",
    "the bloch functions are defined separately on each sublattice such that they vanish on the other .",
    "one can then expand the electron operator in terms of these bloch functions .",
    "the resulting effective low - energy theory of graphene is the 2d massless dirac hamiltonian .",
    "this result can also be derived in terms of @xmath50 theory .",
    "wrapping the graphene sheet onto a cylinder then leads to the generic bandstructure of a metallic swnt shown in fig .",
    "writing the fermi vector as @xmath51 , where the @xmath52-axis is taken along the tube direction and the circumferential variable is @xmath53 , quantization of transverse motion now allows for a contribution @xmath54 to the wavefunction .",
    "however , excitation of angular momentum states other than @xmath55 costs a huge energy of order @xmath56  ev . in an effective low - energy theory",
    ", we may thus omit all transport bands except @xmath55 ( assuming that the swnt is not excessively doped ) . evidently , the nanotube forms a 1d quantum wire with only two transport bands intersecting the fermi energy .",
    "this strict one - dimensionality is fulfilled up to remarkably high energy scales ( ev ) here , in contrast to conventional 1d conductors .",
    "the electron operator for spin @xmath57 is then written as @xmath58 which introduces slowly varying 1d fermion operators @xmath59 that depend only on the @xmath52 coordinate .",
    "neglecting coulomb interactions for the moment , the hamiltonian is : @xmath60 switching from the sublattice ( @xmath33 ) description to the right- and left - movers ( @xmath38 ) indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] implies two copies ( @xmath31 ) of massless 1d dirac hamiltonians for each spin direction . therefore a perfectly contacted and clean swnt",
    "is expected to have the quantized conductance @xmath61 . due to the difficulty of fabricating sufficiently good contacts ,",
    "however , this value has not been experimentally observed so far .",

    "[ fig1 ] we observe that the wavelengths @xmath65 could occur , where the doping determines the wavevector @xmath66 . which of the wavelengths ( [ wavelength ] ) is ultimately realized sensitively depends on the interaction strength @xcite .",
    "let us now examine coulomb interactions mediated by an arbitrary potential @xmath67 .",
    "the detailed form of this potential will depend on properties of the substrate , nearby metallic gates , and the geometry of the setup . in the simplest case , bound electrons and the effects of an insulating substrate",

    "we neglect relativistic effects like retardation or spin - orbit coupling in the following .",
    "electron - electron interactions are then described by the second - quantized hamiltonian @xmath72 the interaction ( [ int0 ] ) can be reduced to a 1d form by inserting the expansion ( [ expa ] ) for the electron field operator .",
    "the reason to do so is the large arsenal of theoretical methods readily available for 1d models .",
    "the result looks quite complicated at first sight : @xmath73 with the 1d interaction potentials @xmath74 these potentials only depend on @xmath75 and on the 1d fermion quantum numbers . for interactions involving different sublattices",
    "@xmath76 for @xmath77 and @xmath78 in eq .",
    "( [ int0 ] ) , one needs to take into account the shift vector @xmath79 between sublattices .    to simplify the resulting 1d interaction ( [ general ] ) , we now exploit momentum conservation , assuming @xmath80 so that umklapp electron - electron scattering can be ignored .",
    "we then have `` forward scattering '' processes , where @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "in addition , `` backscattering '' processes may be important , where @xmath83 .",

    "this part of the electron - electron interaction is the most important one and will be seen to imply ll behavior .",
    "note that it is entirely due to the _ long - ranged _ tail of the coulomb interaction .",
    "all the remaining residual interactions come from short - ranged interaction processes , and since these are intrinsically averaged over the circumference of the tube , their amplitude is quite small and will ( at worst ) only cause exponentially small gaps",

    "( [ fs0 ] ) arises due to the hard core of the coulomb interaction . at such small length scales , the difference between inter- and intra - sublattice interactions matters . to study this term",
    ", one should evaluate @xmath93 from microscopic considerations .",

    "since these short - ranged interaction processes are averaged over the circumference of the tube , @xmath97 , and hence @xmath98 is very small .",
    "a similar reasoning applies to the backscattering contributions @xmath99 in eq .",
    "( [ general ] ) .",
    "because of a rapidly oscillating phase factor , the only non - vanishing contribution comes again from @xmath100 , and we can effectively take a local interaction .",
    "furthermore , only the part of the interaction which does not distinguish among the sublattices is relevant and leads to @xmath101 for the unscreened interaction ( [ unsc ] ) , @xmath102 with @xmath103 .",
    "for externally screened coulomb interaction , one may have @xmath104 .",
    "progress can then be made by employing the _ bosonization _ approach @xcite .",
    "for that purpose , one first needs to bring the non - interacting hamiltonian ( [ h0 ] ) into the standard form of the 1d dirac model .",

    "the plasmon velocities of the four modes are @xmath117 , and hence the charged @xmath118 mode propagates with significantly higher velocity than the three neutral modes .    for the long - ranged interaction ( [ unsc ] ) , the logarithmic singularity in @xmath119 requires the infrared cutoff @xmath120 due to the finite length @xmath121 of the swnt , resulting in : @xmath122 since @xmath123 , we get with @xmath124 m / s the estimate @xmath125 , and therefore @xmath0 is typically in the range @xmath126 to @xmath127 .",

    "in this section , we show first with electrostatic force microscopy ( efm ) that metallic nanotubes are ballistic conductors , an important ingredient for the possible observation of ll behavior .",
    "when nanotubes are attached to metallic electrodes , efm shows that a barrier is formed at the nanotube / metal interface .",
    "this fact is then exploited to observe ll behavior in nanotube devices via the tdos .",

    "the tip is held at constant height above the surface by first making a line - scan of the topography of the surface using intermittent - contact afm , and then making a second pass with the tip held at a fixed distance above the measured topographic features . in order to detect the electrostatic force",
    ", the cantilever is made to oscillate by an ac potential that is applied to the sample at the resonant frequency of the cantilever .",
    "this produces an ac force on the cantilever proportional to the local ac potential @xmath215 beneath the tip : @xmath216 the resulting oscillation amplitude is recorded using an external lock - in amplifier ; the signal is proportional to @xmath215 .",
    "calibration of this signal is made by applying a uniform @xmath215 to the whole sample and measuring the response of the cantilever .",
    "efm yields a signal that is proportional to the local voltage within the nanotube circuit .",
    "however , the signal is also proportional to the derivative of the local capacitance .",
    "this will vary as the geometry changes , yielding e.g.  different signals over a nanotube than over a contact at the same potential .",
    "however , @xmath217 does not vary appreciably as a function of distance along the nanotube .",
    "the measured signal should thus accurately reflect the local voltage within the nanotube .",

    "this indicates that the majority of electrons are transported through the bundle with no scattering .",

    "this confirms the theoretical predictions of very weak scattering in metallic swnts @xcite .",
    "this is also in agreement with previous low - temperature transport measurements which indicate that long metallic swnts may behave as single quantum dots @xcite , and room - temperature measurements of metallic swnts which sometimes exhibit low two - terminal resistance @xcite .",
    "the dominant portion of the overall resistance of 40  k@xmath159 thus comes from the contacts , indicating that the transmission coefficients for entering and leaving the bundle are significantly less than one and the contacts are not ideal . as discussed in the next section , this fact can be exploited to observe ll behavior in nanotube devices via the tunneling density of states ( tdos ) .",

    "let us next discuss possible origins of this behavior .",
    "the data demonstrates that tunneling into the rope has a significant dependence on energy that can not be described by the coulomb blockade model .",
    "one simple explanation for such behavior is that the transmission coefficients of tunnel barriers are strongly energy - dependent , with substantially increased transparency on the energy scale of the measurement .",
    "this would lead e.g.  to activated transport over the barrier , @xmath233 .",
    "however , the fact that the temperature dependence extrapolates to at , see inset of fig .  [ fig6 ] , is inconsistent with this functional form . the origin of this behavior appears to originate rather from the tdos of a ll which vanishes as a power law with energy , see eq .",
    "( [ tdos ] ) .",
    "the assumption that the conductance is limited by tunneling between the metal electrodes and the ll directly leads to the power - law temperature dependence @xmath234 at small bias , @xmath235 .",
    "similarly , for @xmath236 , ll theory predicts that @xmath237 .",
    "the exponent @xmath147 follows from the corresponding ( bulk - tunneling , see below ) exponent in the tdos .",
    "we therefore obtain @xmath238 .",
    "the devices used here were made in the following way .",
    "electron beam lithography is first used to define leads , and ropes are deposited on top of the leads .",
    "samples were selected that showed coulomb blockade behavior at low temperatures with a single well - defined period , indicating the presence of a single dot . the charging energy of these samples indicates a dot with a size substantially larger than the spacing between the leads @xcite .",
    "transport thus occurs by electrons tunneling into the middle ( `` bulk '' ) of the nanotubes .",
    "these devices are referred to as `` bulk - contacted . ''",
    "we can also use a second method , which was described in sec .",
    "[ efm ] , where the contacts are applied over the top of the nanotube rope .",
    "@xmath30from measurements of these devices in the coulomb blockade regime @xcite , we conclude that the electrons are confined to the length of the rope between the leads .",
    "this implies that the leads cut the nanotubes into segments , and transport involves tunneling into the ends of the nanotubes .",
    "this type of device is referred to as `` end - contacted . '' for end - contacted devices , similar temperature and voltage dependences of the conductance @xmath239 are observed .",
    "the obtained exponent @xmath240 is significantly larger than @xmath241 , the exponent obtained for bulk - contacted devices .",
    "the exponent of these power laws obviously depends on whether the electron tunnels into the end or the bulk of the ll .",
    "these exponents are related to the ll parameter @xmath0 by eq .",
    "( [ end ] ) and ( [ bulk ] ) , respectively . using the expected ll parameter @xmath242 ,",
    "see sec .",
    "[ sec22 ] , the expected exponents are @xmath243 and @xmath244 . the approximate power - law behavior as a function of @xmath207 or @xmath152 observed in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] follows the theory for tunneling into a ll .",
    "the predicted values of the exponents are in good agreement with the experimental values . remarkably , power - law behavior in @xmath207 is observed up to 300  k , indicating that nanotubes are lls even at room temperature .",
    "ll theory makes an additional prediction for this system . since the temperature and the voltage play an analogous role in the theory , the differential conductance for a single tunnel junction should obey the universal scaling form ( [ scal ] ) , together with a convolution of the derivative of the fermi distribution , see sec .  [ sec22 ] .",
    "hence it should be possible to collapse the data onto a single universal scaling curve . to do this ,",

    "in this review , we have discussed our recent observation of luttinger liquid behavior in transport experiments on individual metallic carbon nanotubes , along with the detailed theoretical description of this non - fermi liquid state .",
    "the situation in swnts seems rather clear by now , since the ballistic nature of transport can be unambiguously established .",

    "one proposed experiment could probe spin - charge separation by measuring the @xmath191 characteristics of a swnt in contact to two ferromagnetic reservoirs with continuously varying angle @xmath192 between the magnetization directions .",
    "another interesting issue concerns the experimental observation of friedel oscillations in nanotubes , i.e.  density oscillations in the conduction electron density around impurities or the end of the tube .",
    "these density oscillations should decay with a slow interaction - dependent power law ( slower than @xmath247 ) , and , interestingly , the oscillation period can depend on the interaction strength @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is of importance to achieve a better understanding of conduction electron spin resonance ( cesr ) in swnts .",
    "previous experimental attempts have not seen any esr peak , and one of the proposed reasons for its absence involves electron - electron interactions @xcite .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , there are no theoretical investigations concerning cesr for luttinger liquids including the gapless charge degrees of freedom . finally , the phonon backscattering correction to the conductance arising for long swnts at high temperatures should involve an anomalous @xmath248 scaling @xcite that remains to be seen experimentally .",
    "another line of research currently deals with multi - wall nanotubes which are known to exhibit diffusive transport .",
    "nevertheless , the tdos apparently shows very similar behaviors as in a swnt , and superficially it appears that luttinger liquid concepts also apply to mwnts .",
