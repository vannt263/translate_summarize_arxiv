    "the increase in @xmath1c/@xmath2c with galactocentric distance presumably reflects the reduced rates of star formation , and subsequent stellar nucleosynthesis and mass loss , that are characteristic of the outer galactic disk .",
    "the enrichment process , acting over the 4.6  gyr since the formation of the solar system , also offers a natural explanation for the reduction in the @xmath1c/@xmath2c ratio in the vicinity of the sun .",
    "the terrestrial value of @xmath1c/@xmath2c , which should approximate the interstellar value at the time of collapse of the solar nebula , is 89 ( lodders 2003 ) , while values close to 70 are typical of local interstellar clouds .",
    "estimates for the present - day , local ism value of @xmath1c/@xmath2c are usually obtained from absorption or emission studies of carbon - bearing molecules , which serve as proxies when direct measurements of the ambient carbon isotopic ratio are lacking .",
    "wilson ( 1999 ) , for example , derived an average @xmath1c/@xmath2c ratio of @xmath7 from millimeter - wave data on co and h@xmath6co emission for 13 local sources .",
    "more recently , milam et al .",
    "( 2005 ) added millimeter observations of cn in dense clouds to those of co and h@xmath6co and found an average for the present - day , local @xmath1c/@xmath2c ratio of @xmath8 . in this paper , we shall follow sheffer et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and take the ambient @xmath1c/@xmath2c ratio in the solar neighborhood to be @xmath9 ( see also sheffer et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "when molecular proxies are used to evaluate the interstellar abundance ratio of @xmath1c to @xmath2c , the values sometimes show evidence of chemical fractionation . while this is generally not the case in dense molecular clouds , where the processes responsible for fractionation are less effective ( see milam et al .",
    "2005 ) , fractionation can have a significant impact in diffuse clouds .",
    "detailed models predict that the fractionation processes in diffuse environments will not affect each interstellar molecule in the same way .",

    "+  h@xmath10  @xmath11  ch@xmath0  +  h ( elitzur & watson 1978 , 1980 ) , which has an activation energy of @xmath12 k. since ch@xmath0 is associated with cold diffuse clouds , its formation requires that nonthermal processes , such as magnetohydrodynamic shocks or propagating alfvn waves , provide the additional heating . as a result , the @xmath1ch@xmath0/@xmath2ch@xmath0 ratio is believed to be equilibrated and thus to be the best measure of the ambient carbon isotopic ratio in the diffuse ism .",
    "many observations ( e.g. , centurin & vladilo 1991 ; crane et al .",
    "1991 ; stahl & wilson 1992 ; centurin et al .",
    "1995 ) have confirmed this expectation for ch@xmath0 , revealing @xmath1ch@xmath0/@xmath2ch@xmath0 ratios very near 70 for local diffuse clouds .",

    "( 1995 ) give a weighted mean value of @xmath1ch@xmath0/@xmath2ch@xmath0 of @xmath13 for five sight lines to stars within approximately 500 pc of the sun .",

    "1993 ; casassus et al . 2005",
    "; stahl et al . 2008 ) have reported discrepant values of @xmath1ch@xmath0/@xmath2ch@xmath0 .",
    "vladilo et al .",

    "since both of these stars belong to the sco ob1 association ( at @xmath16  kpc ) , vladilo et al . ( 1993 ) suggest that @xmath1ch@xmath0/@xmath2ch@xmath0 may vary on scales of @xmath171 kpc or smaller , depending on the distance to the clouds .",
    "hawkins & jura ( 1987 ) found @xmath1ch@xmath0/@xmath2ch@xmath0 ratios of @xmath18 and @xmath19 toward 20  tau and 23  tau , respectively . because these stars are members of the nearby pleiades cluster ( @xmath20 pc ) , such small values of @xmath1ch@xmath0/@xmath2ch@xmath0 seem to challenge the view that a ratio near 70 characterizes the solar neighborhood .",
    "carbon - bearing molecules susceptible to fractionation , especially co , may exhibit @xmath1c - to-@xmath2c ratios that are either enhanced or reduced with respect to the ambient value .",
    "two competing processes are capable of altering the @xmath1co/@xmath2co ratio in diffuse molecular gas .",
    "selective photodissociation ( spd ) favors @xmath1co since it is the more abundant isotopologue and is thus protected to a greater extent via self shielding ( e.g. , van dishoeck & black 1988 ; visser et al .",
    "the process is effective in the case of co because the photodissociation of this molecule is governed by line absorption . at lower gas",

    "will deplete the carbon reservoir of @xmath2c .",
    "conversely , if @xmath2co is selectively destroyed through photodissociation , then the carbon reservoir will be enhanced in @xmath2c .",
    "any molecule arising from the remaining carbon in the reservoir should therefore possess a @xmath1c - to-@xmath2c ratio that is fractionated in the opposite sense compared to the ratio in co. such behavior is expected for cn because this molecule coexists with co in diffuse molecular clouds ( pan et al . 2005 ) .",
    "existing data on isotopologic ratios in co , cn , and ch@xmath0 for the well - studied sight line to @xmath23  oph offer some evidence that the chemical predictions are borne out .",
    "the diffuse gas in this direction has @xmath1co/@xmath2co = @xmath24 ( lambert et al .",
    "1994 ) , @xmath1cn/@xmath2cn = @xmath25 ( crane & hegyi 1988 ) , and @xmath1ch@xmath0/@xmath2ch@xmath0 = @xmath26 ( crane et al .",
    "thus , the ratios in co and cn are fractionated in opposing directions , while the ratio in ch@xmath0 is consistent with the presumed ambient carbon isotopic ratio .    in this investigation",
    ", we seek to measure @xmath1cn/@xmath2cn and @xmath1ch@xmath0/@xmath2ch@xmath0 ratios along lines of sight where @xmath1co/@xmath2co is either enhanced or reduced .",
    "recent uv surveys of @xmath1co/@xmath2co along diffuse and translucent sight lines ( sonnentrucker et al . 2007 ; burgh et al . 2007 ; sheffer et al . 2007 ) have typically yielded ratios consistent with the average value of @xmath1c/@xmath2c for local interstellar clouds . indeed , the weighted mean value of @xmath1co/@xmath2co for the 25 sight lines studied by sheffer et al .",
    "( 2007 ) is @xmath27 .",
    "however , there are some notable exceptions .",
    "enhanced ratios are found , not only in the direction of @xmath23  oph , but also toward @xmath28  oph  a and @xmath29  oph , where the respective @xmath1co/@xmath2co ratios are @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( federman et al .",

    "our goal is to obtain @xmath1cn/@xmath2cn and @xmath1ch@xmath0/@xmath2ch@xmath0 ratios for as many of these sight lines as possible , so that , when our results are combined with the existing data on @xmath1co/@xmath2co , the suite of measurements can be used to test the predictions of chemical models for diffuse clouds . we reexamine the sight line to @xmath23  oph as a check on our general methodology .",
    "we also obtain @xmath1ch@xmath0/@xmath2ch@xmath0 ratios toward the pleiades stars , 20  tau and 23  tau , to investigate potential scatter in the carbon isotopic ratio within the solar neighborhood .",
    "since high - quality data are needed to detect the weak features associated with @xmath2cn and @xmath2ch@xmath0 , the observations examined here also allow precise determinations of rotational excitation temperatures in cn .",
    "in some situations , these measurements can then be used to constrain the electron density , an important parameter for modeling the physical conditions within a given cloud ( e.g. , black & van dishoeck 1991 ) .",
    "it is widely understood that the cn molecule is maintained in radiative equilibrium with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) in interstellar space ( see the review by thaddeus 1972 ) .",
    "the cmb is the primary source of radiation in the universe at 2.64 mm and 1.32 mm , the wavelengths of the two lowest rotational transitions in cn . as a result ,",
    "cn excitation temperatures reflect the temperature of the cmb at these wavelengths , in the absence of any local sources of excitation . observed excitation temperatures in cn , in fact , do exhibit an excess over the temperature of the cmb , as derived from the far infrared absolute spectrophotometer ( firas ) onboard the _ cobe _ satellite ( @xmath36 k ; mather et al .",
    "1999 ; see also fixsen 2009 ) , but this excess is small ( @xmath37 k ; e.g. , palazzi et al .",
    "since electron impact should dominate any local contribution to cn excitation ( thaddeus 1972 ) , an observed excess provides an estimate for the density of electrons in the portion of the cloud traced by cn .    in order to investigate isotopologic ratios in cn and ch@xmath0 and",

    "an appendix gives results on weak ca  i and ca  ii absorption toward @xmath45 leo and @xmath45 vir , which were observed as unreddened standard stars to aid in the reduction of the mcdonald observatory data ( see  2.1 ) .",
    "principal data for this project were acquired with the harlan j. smith 2.7 m telescope at mcdonald observatory using the tull ( 2dcoud ) spectrograph ( tull et al .",
    "1995 ) in its high - resolution mode ( cs21 ) .",
    "the observations were carried out over the course of four observing runs between 2007 january and 2008 may .",
    "two winter runs ( 2007 january and 2007 december/2008 january ) provided data on 20  tau , 23  tau , and @xmath23  per , while spectra of @xmath28  oph  a , @xmath23  oph , and 20  aql were acquired during two summer observing sessions ( 2007 june and 2008 may ) . for all of the observations , the crossed - dispersed echelle spectrometer was configured with the 79 gr mm@xmath46 grating ( e1 ) , the 145 @xmath47 m slit ( slit 2 ) , and a @xmath48 ccd ( tk3 ) .",
    "order 56 of the e1 grating spectrum was centered at 4077  , enabling both the cn @xmath38@xmath49@xmath40 ( 0 ,  0 ) lines near 3874  and the ch@xmath0 @xmath42@xmath49@xmath40 ( 0 ,  0 ) transition at 4232  to be recorded with a single exposure@xmath49@xmath40 ( 0 ,  0 ) transition at 4300  and on the ca  i @xmath504226 and ca  ii @xmath503933 lines . ] .",
    "the grating tilt was adjusted slightly each night so that the interstellar features would not always fall on the same portion of the ccd .",
    "this helps to mitigate the effect of fixed pattern noise and reduces the chance that an instrumental glitch at a specific location on the ccd will negatively impact the observations .",

    ", @xmath45 lyr ( vega ; a0 v ; @xmath54 ) was observed for this purpose .",
    "calibration exposures for dark current and bias correction , flat fielding , and wavelength assignment were obtained during each of the observing runs .",
    "four 30-minute dark frames were acquired on the first night of a run , while a series of ten biases and ten flats were taken each night .",
    "for accurate wavelength calibration , th - ar comparison spectra were recorded throughout the night at intervals of 2@xmath493 hr .",
    "reduction of the raw mcdonald data employed standard routines within the image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) environment .",
    "first , the overscan region in each of the raw images was fitted with a low - order polynomial and the excess counts were removed from the exposure . an average bias was created for each night and was used to correct the darks , flats , stellar exposures , and comparison lamp frames .",
    "no dark correction was applied to any of the observations because the level of dark current was always found to be insignificant after the bias was removed .",
    "cosmic rays were eliminated from the stellar and comparison lamp exposures by setting the respective thresholds for detection to 50 and 25 times the mean of the surrounding pixels .",
    "any cosmic rays present in individual flat lamp exposures were effectively removed by taking the median of all flats for a given night .",
    "scattered light was modeled in the dispersion and cross - dispersion directions and subtracted from the stellar exposures and from the median flat .",
    "the flat was then normalized to unity and divided into the stellar and comparison lamp frames to account for ( first - order ) pixel - to - pixel variations across the ccd .",
    "one - dimensional spectra were extracted from the processed images by summing across the width of each order without weighting the individual pixels .    at this point ,",
    "the extracted spectra of the program stars were examined in pixel space to determine the pixel coordinates of the interstellar absorption lines .",
    "the combined spectrum of the unreddened star from each night was then inspected at these positions to determine whether any instrumental defects remained after flat fielding .",
    "no obvious glitches were found in the vicinity of cn or ch@xmath0 .",
    "however , low level fixed pattern noise was identified in some of the stellar spectra , particularly those with the highest s / n . to correct for these second - order fluctuations",
    ", the affected stellar exposures were divided by the normalized spectrum of the unreddened star for that night .",
    "the same technique , when applied to exposures with lower s / n , did not significantly improve the quality of the data and so was not adopted for these exposures .",
    "next , stellar spectra were calibrated in wavelength after identifying emission lines in the th - ar comparison spectra , typically 5 per order .",
    "the dispersion solution applied to a given stellar exposure resulted from an interpolation between the solutions derived from the th - ar lamp exposures that preceded and followed the stellar exposure .",
    "finally , the calibrated spectra were shifted to the reference frame of the local standard of rest ( lsr ) .",
    "all exposures of a given target from the multiple observing runs were coadded to maximize the s / n in the final spectrum . before inclusion in the sum ,",
    "each exposure was carefully examined , specifically near the expected positions of the @xmath2cn and @xmath2ch@xmath0 absorption features , to determine if any weak cosmic rays had survived the reduction process .",
    "when cosmic rays were identified , they were removed manually if they occurred far enough away from the interstellar features .",
    "if the cosmic ray affected an interstellar feature directly , then the exposure was removed from the sum .",
    "because the cn and ch@xmath0 lines reside in different echelle orders and the orders were coadded separately , an exposure removed from the sum in one order would not necessarily be removed in the other .",
    "thus , the total exposure times for the two spectral regions may differ somewhat ( see table 1 ) . further complicating the coaddition process was a slight change in the resolving power of the spectrograph from one run to the next .",
    "the measured widths of thorium emission lines in the th - ar comparison spectra indicate a resolving power of @xmath55 ( @xmath56@xmath57 km s@xmath46 ) was achieved during our run in 2007 january .",
    "this decreased to 150,000 ( 2.0 km s@xmath46 ) for the run in june of that year , but returned to 160,000 ( 1.9 km s@xmath46 ) and 168,000 ( 1.8  km  s@xmath46 ) for the runs in 2007 december and 2008 may , respectively .",
    "when combining exposures from multiple observing runs , the data were sampled at the dispersion of the lowest resolution spectra contributing to the sum .",
    "final coadded spectra were normalized to the continuum by fitting low - order polynomials to regions free of interstellar absorption within a narrow spectral window ( no more than 2  wide ) surrounding a given interstellar line .",
    "the immediate vicinity of the cn and ch@xmath0 lines in our mcdonald spectra are free of contamination by either telluric or instrumental features , making continuum normalization straightforward . in only one case",
    "did the placement of the continuum present any significant difficulties .",

    "1994 ) , the gas in an environment where co is fractionated by ice should be enhanced in @xmath1cn relative to @xmath2cn .",
    "in contrast , a high @xmath1co/@xmath2co ratio indicates that the molecular gas has been subjected to selective photodissociation , which preferentially destroys @xmath2co when only @xmath1co is self shielded . in regions where spd is occurring , the dissociated @xmath2c atoms are quickly ionized and incorporated into the pathways that lead to cn , which should result in enhanced @xmath2cn production .",
    "the data plotted in figure 19 are suggestive of the inverse relationship between @xmath1cn/@xmath2cn and @xmath1co/@xmath2co that is expected due to photochemical fractionation and the physical association of cn and co in diffuse cloud cores .",
    "virtually no data points populate the upper right or lower left quadrants of the figure where the fractionation of cn and co occurs in the same directions .",
    "the two data points that do ( just barely ) lie in these regions are for the sight lines to 20  aql ( in the lower left ) and @xmath23  per ( in the upper right ) .",

    "although the downward trend in @xmath1cn/@xmath2cn with increasing @xmath1co/@xmath2co is apparent , the correlation between these two parameters is rather shallow .",
    "in addition , the appearance of a trend is somewhat contingent upon the data points at the extremes .",
    "the sight line with the lowest @xmath1co/@xmath2co ratio ( and highest value of @xmath1cn/@xmath2cn ) is hd  73882 , while the highest values of @xmath1co/@xmath2co ( and lowest @xmath1cn/@xmath2cn ratios ) are found in the directions of @xmath28  oph  a and @xmath23  oph ( in order of increasing @xmath1co/@xmath2co ) .",
    "all of the @xmath1cn/@xmath2cn ratios between these extremes are consistent with the ambient value . yet the uncertainties in @xmath1cn/@xmath2cn toward hd  73882 and @xmath23  oph are among the smallest in the sample , giving credence to the perceived trend .",
    "the severity of cn fractionation depends not only on the effects that alter the relative abundances of @xmath1co and @xmath2co but also on the balance between co and c@xmath0 , the other major reservoir of carbon in diffuse gas .",
    "if co and c@xmath0 have roughly equivalent abundances , then any alteration in @xmath1co/@xmath2co will have an equal , but opposite , effect on @xmath1c@xmath0/@xmath2c@xmath0 and hence on @xmath1cn/@xmath2cn . if c@xmath0 dominates over co , however , fractionation in co will have less of an impact on @xmath1cn/@xmath2cn because there will be a larger pool of c@xmath0 ions that will maintain the ambient 12-to-13 ratio .",
    "the reverse is also true .",
    "when co dominates , co fractionation will have a greater influence on the ratio of @xmath1cn to @xmath2cn .",
    "a detailed modeling effort to track how the relative abundance of each isotope ( and isotopologue ) of interest depends on the physical conditions in the cloud and the parameters of the external uv radiation field is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "instead , we employ a simple , analytical method to estimate the fraction of carbon that is locked up in co along a given line of sight based on the measured isotopologic ratios in cn and co. in what follows , we define @xmath158cn@xmath159cn@xmath160cn@xmath161cn@xmath162 = 1/[n(^{12}$]cn@xmath163cn@xmath164 $ ] as the fraction of cn molecules that take the form of @xmath2cn .",

    "here , we note that the @xmath1co/@xmath2co ratio in the direction of hd  210121 is consistent with 70 and so does not show strong evidence of fractionation , meaning that @xmath89(co ) can not be determined .",
    "an unfractionated value of @xmath1co/@xmath2co toward hd  210121 is also consistent with the suggestion by welty & fowler ( 1992 ) that the uv radiation field incident on the cloud in this direction ( the high - latitude molecular cloud dbb 80 ; see de vries & van dishoeck 1988 ) is lower than the average interstellar field .",
    "finally , the low values of @xmath89(co ) we find toward hd  73882 and hd  154368 are surprising considering the much larger uv optical depths in these directions ( adopting @xmath186 in both cases ) . the larger values of @xmath183 indicate that the sight lines to hd  73882 and hd  154368 probe deeper into their respective clouds , where a majority of the carbon is expected to be in the form of co rather than in neutral atomic or ionic form",

    "thus , instead of surmising that there is a very low fraction of elemental carbon in co in the lines of sight to hd  73882 and hd  154368 , we suggest that we are seeing the effects of a separate fractionation process in cn , which acts to lower @xmath1cn/@xmath2cn such that the enhancements due to co fractionation are not as large as expected .",

    "while all of these ratios are consistent with an ambient @xmath1c/@xmath2c ratio of 70 , the exact correspondence between the ratios in neutral and ionized carbon suggests that there is a real difference between those ratios and that found in c@xmath263o .",
    "since these observations sample gas in a well - known photon - dominated region ( pdr ) , it is reasonable to assume that the slight increase in the @xmath1c@xmath263o/@xmath2c@xmath263o ratio over the ambient value is the result of selective photodissociation .",
    "an application of equation ( 2 ) to these measurements , with the substitution of @xmath89(@xmath2c@xmath0 ) for @xmath89(@xmath2cn ) , would yield a value of @xmath89(co ) = 0.76 , which is consistent with expectations for gas in a dense molecular cloud like that in orion .",
    "we contrast this result with the values of @xmath89(co ) we obtain toward the diffuse molecular clouds in ophiuchus , namely 0.40 toward @xmath28  oph  a and 0.45 toward @xmath23  oph .",
    "the ophiuchus results are appropriate for sight lines that probe the transition region between diffuse and dense clouds , where the conversion of c@xmath0 into co is expected to occur",
    ".    beyond isotopologic ratios , the high quality optical spectra examined in this investigation allowed us to obtain precise rotational excitation temperatures for both @xmath1cn and @xmath2cn .",
    "our weighted mean value of @xmath3(@xmath1cn ) = @xmath4 k implies an excess over the temperature of the cosmic microwave background of only @xmath5  mk .",
    "this excess is considerably smaller than that suggested in the recent survey by syk et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , but is also reduced compared to the excess found by palazzi et al .",
    "both of these previous studies indicated the need for an additional excitation mechanism beyond electron and neutral collisions ( and the cmb ) to account for the observed excitation of cn .",
    "the more modest excess found here eliminates the need for such a mechanism in the general ism .",
    "only three sight lines in our sample exhibit significant excesses in @xmath3 over the cosmic microwave background temperature .",
    "for the clouds in these directions , we derived upper limits to the electron densities in the range 0.3@xmath490.9 @xmath251 .",
    "the rotational excitation temperatures observed in @xmath2cn , from strong detections of the @xmath66(0 ) and @xmath66(1 ) lines in four directions and the first interstellar detection of the @xmath67(1 ) line , show no excess over the temperature of the cmb .",
    "we are grateful to yaron sheffer for allowing us the use of his program ismod and to dan welty for suggesting that we include the vlt sight lines in our analysis .",

    "five components comprise the fit .",
    "these have lsr velocities of @xmath4912.7 , @xmath498.9 , @xmath496.4 , @xmath491.5 , and + 0.5 km s@xmath46.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]      in this appendix , we provide results on weak ca  i ( @xmath504226 ) and ca  ii  k ( @xmath503933 ) absorption toward the stars @xmath45 leo and @xmath45 vir , which served as unreddened standard stars for our mcdonald observations .",
    "although @xmath45 lyr was also observed once as a standard , strong stellar lines in the vicinity of ca  i and ca  ii  k , as well as lower s / n , prevent any interstellar features from being discerned in this direction .",
    "table 10 presents the equivalent widths of ca  i and ca  ii  k for the other two stars along with previous measurements and upper limits from the literature .",
    "figure 21 shows our fits to the observed ca  ii  k profiles . for @xmath45 leo , the fit results in a total column density of @xmath87(ca  ii ) = @xmath265 @xmath266",
