    "many strongly correlated ( layered ) materials with quasi two dimensional ( 2d ) structure show fluctuating or static stripe order ( unidirectional density wave states ) over a substantial range of temperatures.@xcite in particular , there has been considerable interest in studying whether or not stripes are inextricably connected to the high temperature superconductivity that occurs in the cuprates.@xcite however , characterizing the stripe order in these materials is difficult due to the complex and strongly correlated nature of these materials , and the presence of significant amounts of quenched disorder.@xcite    from the symmetry view point , there is no difference between a unidirectional charge density wave state ( cdw ) in a weakly interacting quasi-2d system and a stripe - ordered state of a strongly correlated system .",
    "cdw states can occur in the weak coupling limit only if there are sufficiently well nested portions of the fermi surface . since this is non - generic in more than 1d , one would like to identify what is special about those higher dimensional materials in which nested fermi surfaces appear .",
    "moreover , for a layered quasi-2d material with tetragonal @xmath0 symmetry , the cdw ground state can either be bidirectional ( checkerboards ) maintaining the point group symmetry of the lattice , or unidirectional ( stripes ) with a reduced symmetry , and again we would like to understand what physics governs this choice .",

    "the existence of a unidirectional cdw was first detected by transmission electron microscopy ( tem).@xcite angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes )  @xcite measurements have shown that the cdw ordering wavevector nests large portions of the fermi surface , which are in turn gapped , thus strongly indicating that the cdw is a consequence of fermi surface nesting .",
    "more recent x - ray scattering and stm measurements have confirmed the existence of the cdw and its unidirectional character in great detail.@xcite detailed studies of the fermi surface topology using arpes  @xcite and positron annihilation  @xcite support the notion that the cdw is the result of a nesting - driven fermi surface instability .",
    "however , the driving force for the strong breaking of the point group symmetry ( @xmath4 ) produced by the unidirectional cdw formation in @xmath1te@xmath2 has not been clear previously",

    "@xmath41 , and equivalently the @xmath6-fs is best nested by @xmath42 . however , away from the half filling , @xmath43 does a poor job in nesting the @xmath6-fs and conversely for @xmath42 .",
    "note that @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are related by the @xmath29 symmetry of the host lattice . on the other hand , the wavevector @xmath48 ( and its @xmath29 symmetry related vectors ) , which perfectly nests the full fs for @xmath28 , does a reasonable job in nesting both the @xmath5-fs and the @xmath6-fs",
    "thus , for small @xmath27 , there are two independent candidates ( not related to each other via @xmath29 symmetry ) for the cdw ordering wavevectors : @xmath49    to see which ordering vector is preferred , we now compute the corresponding charge density ( lindhard ) susceptibility , @xmath50 . for a given wavevector @xmath51 at a given temperature @xmath52 , @xmath53 where the integral is over the first brillouin zone , @xmath54 is the band index , and @xmath55 .",

    "the calculated susceptibility has a maximum at a wavevector @xmath77 close to @xmath67 or @xmath78 , depending on whether the temperature , @xmath79 or @xmath80 , in agreement with our analysis of the fs .",
    "the precise location of @xmath77 shifts slightly as a function of @xmath52 , but so long as @xmath81 , the maximum always lies close to @xmath82 , so this deviation does not significantly affect the resulting picture of the phase diagram .",

    "since @xmath67 nests only the @xmath5 portion of the fs , there is little competition between the ordering tendency at @xmath67 and at the symmetry related vector , @xmath87 .",
    "thus , as we shall show below , wherever cdw ordering with wavevector @xmath67 occurs , simultaneous ordering occurs at @xmath87 , making this a state with `` checkerboard '' order .",
    "however , since ordering at wavevector @xmath78 opens a gap on the entire fs , it prevents ordering at the symmetry related vector , @xmath88 ; when @xmath78 is the preferred ordering vector , the resulting state has `` stripe '' order .",
    "to obtain an explicit phase diagram , we add an electron - phonon coupling and solve the resulting model in mean - field approximation .",
    "thus , we investigate the following mean - field hamiltonian @xmath89 where the sum over @xmath51 runs over the possible ordering vectors , @xmath90 and all harmonics , such as @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "the order parameter @xmath93 for the cdw with the ordering vector @xmath51 is related to the lattice distortion @xmath94 through @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the electron - phonon coupling , and the dimensionless effective interaction @xmath97/[m\\omega^2_{{\\mathbf{q}}}]$ ] , where @xmath98 is the phonon frequency and @xmath99 is the ion mass .",

    "fortunately , in the present case , for the most part the transitions are continuous , or at worst weakly first order .",
    "therefore , the phase boundaries can be identified by expanding the mean - field ( landau ) free energy to low order in powers of @xmath101 .",

    "one consequence of remaining local cdw correlations above @xmath12 will be the presence of peaks in the structure factor at positions corresponding to the bragg vectors of the ordered state , but with width inversely proportional to the thermal correlation length.@xcite however in the case of a stripe phase , more dramatic effects can be expected . if there is only a single transition ; then the  stripe liquid \" phase above @xmath12 does not break any of the lattice symmetries , and consequently equivalent peaks in the structure factor should appear both at the stripe ordering vector , and at the conjugate wavevector ( rotated by 90@xmath162 ) .",
    "such behavior has already been seen , albeit only in the magnetic scattering , in the stripe liquid phase of la@xmath163sr@xmath164nio@xmath165.@xcite on the other hand , a two stage transition is also possible with an intermediate ,  stripe nematic \" phase,@xcite in which stripe fluctuations are sufficiently violent to restore translation , but not the full @xmath29 symmetry of the host crystal ; in such a phase , the peaks at the stripe ordering wave vector should be stronger ( possibly , much stronger ) than those at the conjugate wavevector . in this case",

    "arpes,@xcite one can estimate the mean - field transition temperature to be @xmath166k , which is an order of magnitude greater than the theoretical value of @xmath72 and also greater than @xmath167 .",
    "hence , the theory predicts that @xmath1te@xmath2 should have a unidirectional cdw ordered phase ( stripes ) with ordering vector approximately equal to either @xmath114 or @xmath168.@xcite this is consistent with the experiments@xcite which find stripe order with @xmath169 in the present non - doubled unit cell notation.@xcite with the simplified band - structure used in the present analysis , @xmath170 ( mod @xmath171 ) , however , as mentioned above , the maximum of the susceptibility occurs at a slightly different weakly temperature dependent wave - vector ; at @xmath172k , the maximum occurs at @xmath173 , which is almost identical to the experimental results at comparable temperatures .",
    "moreover , the mean field theory predicts that the phase transition into the stripe ordered phase from higher temperature phase is a second order phase transition .",
    "this is also consistent with recent experimental results.@xcite    even though we are dealing with a stoichiometric phase with an integer number of electrons per unit cell , if the transition is continuous , then ( at least for commensurability @xmath174 ) the cdw ordered state just below @xmath12 is generically incommensurate , in the sense that the ordering vector is not locked to the lattice .",
    "this follows from the fact that the lowest order term which locks the cdw to the lattice is proportional to @xmath175 and so is irrelevant ( for @xmath176 ) in the renormalization group sense@xcite at @xmath12 .",

    "another subtlety of the problem derives from the existence of te bilayers in @xmath1te@xmath2 .",
    "if the bilayer splitting , @xmath181 , it can be ignored , and a single transition occurs as treated in the present work .",

    "charge density waves often break the point group symmetry of the host lattice .",
    "this phenomenon is particularly common in strongly correlated materials including many transition metal oxides which exhibit stripe order .",
    "the strong interactions present in those ( @xmath184-band ) systems make the physics of pattern selection more difficult to study from a microscopic viewpoint .",
    "however , one may hope that extrapolating from the weak coupling limit ( solved in the present paper ) may give some insight into the deeper issues of pattern selection in highly correlated materials .",
    "the underlying physics that is responsible for the existence of a cdw state in the present class of reasonably weakly interacting quasi-2d systems is the existence of a hidden 1d character of the band structure . in the present paper ,",
