    "port hamiltonian systems represent an important class of systems used in modelling , analysis and control of physical systems , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "these representations are used in lumped parameter system analysis and control stemming from e.g. , mechanical systems , electrical systems , electromechanical systems , power systems .",
    "one of the main features of such systems is the passivity property , i.e. , the internal energy of the system at some time is lower than or equal to the sum of the stored energy in the past and the externally supplied energy in the interval between the past and the present ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "passivity is essential for stability analysis and controller synthesis represented by techniques such as passivity based control ( pbc ) and interconnection and damping assignment ( ida ) , see e.g. , @xcite . for instance , in the case of large power systems , consisting of synchronous machines interconnected through transmission lines , the passivity ( dissipativity ) analysis of its port hamiltonian modelling is important for the stability assessment of such systems and for further control design , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "however , physical modelling often leads to ( port hamiltonian ) systems of high dimension , usually difficult to analyse and simulate and unsuitable for control design .",
    "hence , model reduction is called for . in the systems and control",
    "literature there are many results on model order reduction with preservation of properties and/or structure .",
    "for example , passivity preserving model reduction is discussed in e.g. , @xcite and structure preservation is considered in e.g. , @xcite for symmetric systems , @xcite for mechanical systems , @xcite for port hamiltonian systems .    in the problem of model reduction moment",
    "matching techniques represent an efficient tool , see e.g. @xcite for a complete overview for linear systems . using a numerical approach based on krylov projection methods the ( reduced order ) model is obtained by efficiently constructing a lower degree rational function that approximates a given transfer function ( assumed rational ) . the low degree rational function matches the given transfer function at various points in the complex plane .",
    "if the interpolation points are at zero , then the pad approximation problem is solved .",
    "if the interpolation points are finite , then the general rational interpolation problem is solved . in the case of multiple - input multiple output ( mimo ) systems the problem",
    "is called tangential interpolation , i.e. , finding an approximation that interpolates a transfer matrix at selected points along selected directions , see @xcite for further details . if the interpolation points are at infinity , the problem is called partial realization and has been studied in e.g. , @xcite and references therein .    alternatively , for single - input single - output ( siso ) systems , a system theoretic , time - domain approach",
    "to moment matching has been taken in @xcite . in short , the notion of moment of a linear , minimal system has been related to the unique solution of a sylvester equation , see also , e.g. , @xcite , for previous results .",
    "furthermore , the moments are in one - to - one relation with the steady - state response ( provided it exists ) of the given system driven by a signal generator , which `` contains '' the interpolation points .",
    "the moments have also been connected to the solution of a dual sylvester equation , and shown to be in one - to - one relation with the well - defined steady - state response of the given system driving a ( generalized ) signal generator . used for model reduction , the time - domain approach yields simple and direct characterizations of all parameterized , reduced order models that match a prescribed set of moments of a given system at a set of _ finite _ interpolation points .",
    "the classes of reduced order models that achieve moment matching contain subclasses of models that meet additional constraints , i.e. , the free parameters are useful for enforcing properties such as , e.g. , passivity , stability or relative degree , irrespective of the choice of interpolation points .    recently , in @xcite the rational interpolation problem for linear port hamiltonian systems has been addressed using krylov projection methods , yielding reduced order models that match the moments of the given port hamiltonian system at a set of prescribed finite or infinite interpolation points . improved procedures for mimo systems have been developed in @xcite , where a near - optimal port hamiltonian approximation that satisfies a set of tangential interpolation conditions is proposed .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite the partial realization problem for port hamiltonian systems has been considered .",
    "the procedure therein involves finding a change of coordinates such that the hamiltonian becomes the square of the norm of the state vector , since a direct application of the krylov methods does not yield a port hamiltonian approximant .",
    "then the krylov projections are computed and applied to the system in the new coordinates , resulting in a port hamiltonian model that matches the markov parameters of the given system .",
    "note that the hamiltonian of the approximant is again the square of the norm of the reduced order state vector .",
    "in this paper we study the problem of computing low order approximations that match a set of prescribed moments at a set of finite or infinite points , of a given siso , port hamiltonian , linear system and preserve the port hamiltonian structure , in the framework of time - domain moment matching , as described in the following problem .",

    "compute _ the families _ of _ parameterized _ reduced order models that match the moments of a given port hamiltonian system at a set of finite or infinite interpolation points ( in this case the models match a set of prescribed markov parameters ) .",
    "2 .   characterize the families of reduced order models which satisfy the following properties : the models match the moments of the given port hamiltonian system and _ preserve the port hamiltonian structure_. in other words , from the classes of models that achieve moment matching we find the reduced order models that inherit the port hamiltonian form.@xmath0    in the case of matching at finite interpolation points we obtain families of parameterized _ state - space _ , reduced order port hamiltonian models that approximate the given port hamiltonian system .",
    "all the reduced order state - space models share the same transfer function . in the siso case ,",
    "the state space parameters are used to enforce additional structure constraints such as diagonal hamiltonian function , diagonal dissipation , etc . however , at the moment we are not able to determine which of the original variables and their meaning is retained in the reduced order model . in the mimo case the free parameters can be used to define appropriate directions such that the reduced order models satisfy prescribed sets of tangential interpolation conditions . regarding the computational aspect , we establish connections between the models from the families of _ parameterized _ port hamiltonian reduced order models that achieve moment matching and the counterpart approximations obtained using krylov projections , i.e. , there is a relation between the free parameter and the krylov projector .    since , to the best of the authors knowledge , the existing moment matching techniques do not yield an a priori approximation error bound and assuming the interpolation points are free parameters , we can use existing results from the literature to choose these parameters in order to improve the accuracy of the approximation , e.g. , in the sense that the @xmath1 norm of error decreases , although it is not the scope of the paper .",
    "we study the problem of markov parameters matching , i.e. , the partial realization problem , by extending the time - domain moment matching results to the case of interpolation points at infinity .",
    "we define the notion of moment for a class of linear , descriptor representations , associated to the transfer function of the given system , in terms of the ( unique ) solutions of _ generalized _ sylvester equations and their dual counterparts .",
    "in particular , the markov parameters of a given system are the moments of the associated descriptor realization at zero . furthermore",
    ", we relate the moments to the steady - state response , provided it exists , of the descriptor realization driven by / driving signal generators . performing model reduction we obtain several families of parameterized , ( descriptor ) reduced order models that match a set of prescribed moments of the descriptor realization associated to the transfer function of a given linear system . in particular , matching at zero yields classes of reduced order models that match the markov parameters of the given linear system .",
    "as in the rational interpolation case , we establish relations between the _ parameter _ which define the family of the port hamiltonian approximation that matches a set of markov parameters and a krylov projector , giving insight into the computational issue of the proposed solution .",
    "+ finally , we apply these results to linear port hamiltonian systems , resulting in _ families _ parameterized of state - space , reduced order port hamiltonian models that match the markov parameters of the given port hamiltonian system .",
    "note that the free parameters can be used to enforce additional physical structure to the approximant .",
    "we mention that , to our knowledge , there is no structured procedure to determine the number of interpolation points needed .",
    "however , based on @xcite the number of interpolation points can be related to the order of the dynamics associated to the higher order hankel singular values of the given system . to conclude , we mention that the scope of the paper is not to address computational issues , but to propose a system - theoretical based framework for port hamiltonian reduced order modelling , consistent with the existing theory and suitable for future _ nonlinear _ extension .    to give the complete picture , we compute several ( equivalent ) families of reduced order port hamiltonian models , starting from the unique solution of a sylvester equation and its",
    "_ dual counterpart_. the families exhibit the same type of properties , without additional advantages or disadvantages , obtained however through different parameterizations .",
    "this argument is consistent with the rational krylov projection modelling where the left and the right projection are dual to each other .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sect_prel ]",
    "we give a brief overview of the definition of moments and moment matching for linear port hamiltonian systems , as well as of the family of parameterized reduced order models that achieve moment matching at a set of finite interpolation points .",
    "we also recall the procedures to obtain a port hamiltonian approximation using krylov projections for both siso and mimo systems .",
    "we present existing choices of interpolation points which yield accurate ( in some sense ) approximations .",
    "the section is completed with the formulation of the model reduction problem to be solved , a particular case of the [ prob_redmod_prose ] for matching at finite interpolation points . in section [ sect_markovm ]",
    "we study the general problem of time - domain moment matching for a class of descriptor representations associated to the transfer function of a given linear system .",
    "in particular we show that matching the moments of the descriptor realization at zero is equivalent to matching the markov parameters of the given system .",
    "moreover , we obtain the classes of reduced order models that match a set of the markov parameters of the given system .",
    "these models are then related to their krylov projection counterparts .",
    "based on section [ sect_prel ] , in section [ sect_ph_match ] we discuss the problem of moment matching at a set of finite interpolation points , with preservation of the port hamiltonian structure , and characterize the port hamiltonian reduced order models .",
    "furthermore , we give a necessary and sufficient condition for a reduced order model that achieves moment matching to be a port hamiltonian model .",
    "we describe the families of parameterized state - space port hamiltonian approximations , the free parameters of which can be used to enforce further properties .",
