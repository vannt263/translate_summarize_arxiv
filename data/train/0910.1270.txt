    "[ fig.prb12 ] and [ fig.prb13 ] may be a consequence of a certain irreversible behavior around the peak - effect region , so that experiments with varying temperature and corresponding measurements with varying magnetic field ( and at fixed @xmath26 ) may not give exactly the same results .",
    "+ in order to discuss these features in the @xmath28 curves that show the peak effect , we plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig.prb6 ] a selected @xmath28 curve for @xmath35 t .",
    "we define the temperatures @xmath36 as the temperature at the local minimum , @xmath37 as the temperature at the local maximum of the @xmath28 curve , respectively , and @xmath38 as the distance on the temperature scale between the local maximum of the resistance at @xmath37 and the sharp increase in @xmath28 at the transition to the normal state near @xmath3 ( see fig .  [ fig.prb6 ] ) .",
    "a minimum in the resistance @xmath28 at @xmath36 close to @xmath3 , as observed in electrical transport measurements on , e.g. , v@xmath0si @xcite , nb@xmath0ge , mo@xmath0si @xcite , @xmath39h - nbse@xmath40 @xcite , nb @xcite , ceru@xmath40 , ceco@xmath40 , yb@xmath0rh@xmath41sn@xmath42 @xcite , and yba@xmath40cu@xmath0o@xmath43 @xcite , has usually been interpreted as a manifestation of the peak effect . in all these cited experiments , such a minimum was observed without the aid of a superimposed ac field . only in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors used a configuration comparable to ours by cycling of the main magnetic field prior to their measurements on v@xmath0si in order to restore the signature of the peak effect . in our measurements on nb@xmath0sn",
    ", however , such a characteristic feature in @xmath28 appears by the continuous application of a shaking field @xmath5 , which allows us to restore the peak effect in a very convenient and efficient way with a high data - point density .",
    "this shaking field @xmath5 exerts a periodic lorentz force on the magnetic flux lines , in combination with an additional constant force induced by the used transport current @xmath44 .",
    "as soon as these combined forces exceed the pinning force , the flux lines will be depinned and the resulting dissipative motion causes a finite resistance for @xmath45 . according to an explanation of the peak effect by pippard @xcite",
    ", the fll softens in the peak - effect region , i.e. , the shear modulus is vastly reduced , the fll becomes less rigid , and the flux lines can bend and adjust better to the pinning sites .",
    "since the resulting pinning is stronger in the peak - effect region , the motion of the flux lines is hindered and therefore the resistance decreases .",
    "this increased pinning strength leads to an increase in the critical current , which can also be observed as a drop in the real part of the ac susceptibility ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "+ to prove that the observed features in @xmath28 at @xmath36 coincide with the magnetically determined peak effect , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig.prb15 ] the results from figs .",
    "[ fig.prb3]b and [ fig.prb4 ] in one magnetic phase diagram .",
    "the lines correspond to the position of the center of the peak - effect region and seem to match for both data sets , which strongly supports the interpretation of the observed drop in resistance at @xmath36 as a signature of the peak effect .",
    "the vertical and horizontal bars drawn in this figure are derived from the widths of the respective features that we ascribe to the peak effect .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig.prb15 ] shows the magnetic - field dependence of the width @xmath46 on the magnetic - field scale for both data sets , where we have converted @xmath38 according to @xmath47 .",

    "@xcite investigated the same nb@xmath0sn crystal by studying the higher harmonics of the ac magnetic susceptibility @xmath48 .",
    "the peak effect was detected in magnetic fields between @xmath49 and @xmath50 t , and the resulting magnetic phase diagram is in line with ours ( fig .  [ fig.prb15 ] ) .",
    "+   + in the following we discuss the dependence of the observed features in @xmath28 on the transport current @xmath44 , on the oscillation frequency @xmath29 , and on the amplitude @xmath5 . reducing the transport current to @xmath27ma",
    "leads naturally to more scattered data in figs .",
    "[ fig.prb5 ] as compared to the measurements for @xmath19ma shown in figs .",
    "[ fig.prb4 ] .",
    "noteworthy , flux - line motion sets in at @xmath51 t and below for @xmath27ma ( fig .",
    "[ fig.prb5]b ) , while it already occurs in @xmath35 t for the higher transport current @xmath19ma ( fig .",
    "[ fig.prb4]b ) .",
    "this trend can be explained if one assumes , in line with the anderson - kim flux creep theory @xcite , that a large transport current leads to a higher mobility of flux - line bundles due to the stronger lorentz force as compared to a situation with a small current @xmath44 .",
    "+ the existence of a threshold frequency above which a finite resistance below @xmath3 abruptly sets in seemingly deviates from the findings by risse _",
    "@xcite on amorphous mo@xmath0si films , where a linear dependence of the resistance below @xmath3 on the frequency of the shaking field was reported , without any threshold frequency .",
    "we note , however , that while the maximum amplitude of the shaking field in our measurements , @xmath52mt , was comparable to that used by risse _",
    "( @xmath53mt ) @xcite , the frequencies used in ref .",
    "@xcite were usually between @xmath54khz and @xmath55khz , much higher than those used in our experiment ( @xmath56khz , @xmath24khz for most experiments ) .",
    "therefore , a possible threshold frequency may have gone unnoticed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and/or the different material parameters and degree of disorder may play a certain role here .",

    "the vortex system can be equilibrated if the amplitude @xmath5 of a shaking field fulfills @xmath57 with @xmath58 . for too small values of @xmath5",
    "the shaking field can not fully penetrate the sample , and parts of the sample remain unaffected by the ac magnetic field .",
    "such an argument may explain the observation of a threshold value @xmath59 for @xmath5 above which the peak effect can be observed in our @xmath28 data . to make a quantitative comparison with the above prediction we assumed the validity of bean s critical - state model , where @xmath60 is assumed to be spatially constant .",
    "we estimated @xmath61ma and @xmath62a / m@xmath11 from a corresponding measurement of the current - voltage characteristics in @xmath35 t and at @xmath63k and using a voltage criterion @xmath64v . with the sample width @xmath65 mm and the measuring current @xmath66ma",
    ", we obtain the condition @xmath67mt in @xmath35 t and at @xmath63k .",

    "the measured value @xmath76 is lower than this estimated value .",
    "in addition , considering the fact that corresponding measurements with @xmath77khz give almost the same @xmath78 values , we can not confirm the in @xcite predicted linear dependence of @xmath78 on @xmath29 .",
    "+ we note that the effects of ac transport currents on the flux - line lattice can be similar to those of a superimposed shaking field produced by an ac coil as it has been shown by gittleman and rosenblum @xcite who used radio frequencies for their transport current , but without investigating the peak effect any further .",
    "higgins and bhattacharya @xcite measured the peak effect using an ac source for the transport current ( @xmath79ma , unknown frequency ) with a standard lock - in technique , but without the aid of a superimposed shaking field .",
    "+ in our experiment , the square - wave excitation of the measuring current corresponds to a leading measuring frequency @xmath80hz , with rapidly decreasing amplitude of the higher harmonics .",
    "using the total current @xmath74ma and applying ampre s law ( with the sample approximated by a cylinder of equal cross section @xmath10mm@xmath11 ) we obtain a self field at the sample surface of the order of @xmath81 t . both the used measuring frequency and this self field",
    "are well below the here reported threshold values ( @xmath82hz , and @xmath83 t , respectively ) , above which the shaking has shown to become effective , and we therefore conclude that the influence of the measuring current is negligible when compared to that of the external main shaking field .",
    "+ we finally want to point out that the technique of measuring @xmath28 with an external continuously oscillating magnetic field may be more sensitive to explore the peak effect than inferring it from corresponding magnetization @xmath4 measurements alone , at least in some parts of the magnetic phase diagram of a sample . while the peak - effect feature is not discernible at temperatures higher than @xmath84k in the @xmath4 data shown in figs .",
    "[ fig.prb3 ] , the resistivity data ( taken in combination with an ac magnetic field ) reveal the peak - effect region also in this high - temperature region of the magnetic phase diagram .",
    "the absence of a corresponding signature in our resistivity data for magnetic fields larger than @xmath85 t , however , can be explained with a strongly increasing @xmath60 with decreasing temperature , so that a condition similar to @xmath86 can no longer be fulfilled due to technical limitations for the amplitude @xmath5 .",
    "we expect , however , that larger shaking amplitudes @xmath5 do , in principle , allow to study the peak effect also in higher magnetic fields and at lower temperatures .",
    "we have reported on the , to the best of our knowledge , first observation of the manifestation of the peak effect in resistivity data that is induced by the continuous application of an external oscillating magnetic field @xmath6 .",
