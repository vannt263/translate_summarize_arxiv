    "to further enhance the low - level radiation detection capabilities of the pacific northwest national laboratory shallow underground laboratory ( @xcite ) , the development of a low - background liquid scintillation counter is underway .",
    "the instrument is being developed to measure a range of low - level beta - emitting isotopes collected in the environment such as tritium , @xmath2c , strontium isotopes , and others . such measurements impact a range of sciences including studies of environmental transport mechanisms , biological radio - isotopic dating , radioactive fallout , or tracking of nuclear accident effluent ( @xcite ) .",
    "liquid scintillation counting ( lsc ) identifies radioactive decay through detection of the ensuing scintillation photons produced by charged particles emitted into the scintillation cocktail .",
    "the photons are detected and this signal is amplified with one or more photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) for processing in a data acquisition system .",
    "liquid scintillation counting provides a mechanism for counting @xmath0 and @xmath1 emitters down to very low concentrations , due primarily to the high detection efficiency achievable through the use of a scintillation cocktail detection medium .",
    "measurement of tritium , @xmath3h , is useful for bench - marking a system s performance .",
    "typical commercial low - background liquid scintillation counters can achieve detection limits on the order of 1  bq of @xmath3h per liter in the presence of @xmath41  count per minute ( cpm ) backgrounds for 1000 minute ( min ) counting times .",
    "for the present study , consider the extrapolation of the decrease in lower limit of detection as a function of decreased background count rate , as shown in figure  [ fig : lowbackground ] for a series of counting times .",
    "the @xmath3h counting efficiency in the extrapolated example is 35% for a constant sample size of 10  ml ( @xcite ) . a combination of decreasing the background to the order of ten to one hundred counts per day and increasing the counting times to days results in a lower limit of detection more than an order of magnitude lower than typically achieved in commercial instruments .",
    "the design presented in this report aims to reduce the background to a range from 0.01 to 0.07  cpm . in the case of tritium ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lowbackground ] ) this results in detection limits between 0.05 and 0.2  bq / l depending on the number of days a sample is counted .",
    "these estimates employ currie s equation for minimum detectable activity ( mda ) , given in equation [ eq : toycurrie ] ( @xcite ) , where c@xmath5 is the background count rate ( cpm ) , t@xmath5 is the background count time ( min ) , @xmath6 is the counting efficiency , v@xmath7 is the sample weight ( grams ) , and t@xmath7 is the sample count time ( min ) . @xmath8 the factor of 60 is used to express the mda in terms of bq / g .",
    "when the measurement is quantified for liquid volumes , the sample weight is replaced by a volume ( milliliters , ml ) resulting in a mda reported in units of bq / ml . the constant 2.71 is the frequently used value to account for a zero blank case corresponding to a 5% probability of false negatives and 4.65 accounts for a 5% probability of making type  i or type  ii errors .",
    "the currie equation provides a consistent way of quantitatively evaluating measurements and is valuable for revealing the potential value of a custom low background lsc system .",
    "foreshadowing the background estimates described in section  [ sec : backgroundestimates ] , the ultra - low - background liquid scintillation counter ( ulb lsc ) under development is expected to lower detection limits by more than a factor of 10 in comparison to commercial systems located in surface laboratories . in some cases , the result of the background reduction",
    "is used to directly improve the mda of the measurement . in other cases , the 10 - 100 reduction factor in background rate",
    "is used as a trade - off with other factors in the currie equation ( such as sample mass or volume ) to reach the same target mda for a given measurement .",
    "for example , an improved mda may allow greater reach of age - dating in a geochronology scenario while a fixed mda for expected levels of tritium in water implies reduced sample size .    a companion paper submitted to the j. radioanal .",
    "( @xcite ) evaluates in detail a number of specific cases .",
    "a summarized selection of three examples from that analysis is presented here to demonstrate the potential use of a ulb lsc system :    ( * # 1 * )  a campaign of measurements of tritium backgrounds in natural spring waters was conducted prior to construction of a repository for radioactive waste ( @xcite ) .",
    "a total of 124 springs were sampled and each sample was electrolytically enriched in tritium ( 20@xmath9 enrichment ) .",
    "liquid scintillation counting was employed to measure the resulting tritium concentrations using a lsc system having 20 - 23% detection efficiency and a background rate of 1 - 2  cpm , resulting in an mda of 0.3  bq / l .",
    "the electrolytic enrichment step required 139  hours / sample and each sample was counted seven times for 30  minutes .",
    "together this is approximately 6  days of total process time per sample . in the case of a low background lsc system with a background rate reduced to 0.01  cpm",
    ", the spring water samples could be counted without the electrolytic enrichment step achieving the same mda in 195  minutes of lsc counting . including the seven - fold replicate counting , the total process time would remain less than 1  day .",
    "( * # 2 * )  a method for determination of @xmath10sr levels in food samples is comprised of the combustion , dissolution , precipitation , extraction chromatography , ion exchange chromatography , and final precipitation of a 140  g food sample ( @xcite ) .",
    "this complex process requires two days to convert the food sample into an lsc sample for analysis with a 1220  quantulus  low - background lsc .",
    "an mda of 0.1  bq / kg was achieved with 100  minute count times . lowering the background to 0.1 or 0.01  cpm would reduce the sample size to 50 or 22  g , respectively , for an equivalent mda , potentially reducing the scale of the complex sample preparation process .",
    "( * # 3 * )  as part of the @xmath11u decay chain , @xmath12ac is present in both the water column and ocean sediment .",
    "the parent @xmath13pa is particle - reactive , taking residence in ocean floor sediment , while @xmath12ac is non - particle reactive and is released to the water column .",
    "thus @xmath12ac concentration in excess of that supported by the @xmath11u concentration in the water represents a tracer of water transport from the ocean floor on time scales comparable to the 21.8  year half - life of @xmath12ac ( @xcite ) .",
    "typical measurements of @xmath12ac in this context rely upon chemical isolation of a pure actinium fraction for electroplating followed by a 3 - 4  month in - growth period after which the more readily measured daughter @xmath12th is alpha - counted .",
    "the lowest limit of quantification reported in sea water is for an 80-l sample containing @xmath1410,000 atoms of @xmath12ac / l ( @xmath1410  @xmath15bq / l ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "achieving roughly the same level of sensitivity is possible if the purified ac fraction is counted for approximately 2  days on a lsc system having a background rate of 0.1  cpm , without waiting for daughter in - growth to perform the measurement .    in summary",
    ", these three potential applications together begin to demonstrate how an ultra - low background lsc could allow for processing and evaluating samples in significantly shorter _ total process time _ and/or reduce the sample sizes required in current techniques .",
    "the ultra - low - background instrument suggested above is only achievable by both siting the instrument in a location shielded from cosmic - ray products and incorporating background reduction methods in the system design .",
    "for example , a report shows the performance of commercial quantulus systems , comparatively , in surface and underground locations ( @xcite ) .",
    "roughly a factor of three background reduction was obtained in the quantulus system operated underground .",
    "the report also studied the impact of scintillation vial volume ( 1 - 7  ml ) on detection sensitivity for @xmath2c demonstrating 0.1 - 0.3  cpm background rates are achievable in the underground location .",
    "the 3800 meters - water - equivalent ( mwe ) overburden shielding largely eliminates the background rate due to cosmic - ray products and thus implies the limiting backgrounds for the system are the naturally occurring radioactivity in the laboratory and/or the instrument s components .",
    "the present article presents a design analysis for a lsc system targeting a background rate in the range of 10 - 100 counts per day ( cpd ) , equivalent to 0.07 - 0.007  cpm .",
    "the ulb lsc shield design is based on a number of general principles , experience with similar shields already present in the pacific northwest national laboratory ( pnnl ) shallow underground laboratory , and a few initial parametric simulation studies .",
    "each of these three types of consideration is presented in - turn within this section .",
    "the key innovation for the ulb lsc system is the implementation of low background shielding best practices around a novel approach to the scintillation light collection ( @xcite ) .",
    "a hollow light guide cut out of the copper interior shielding and coated with a specularly reflective material will guide the photons emitted from the liquid scintillator around a 90-degree curve .",
    "the curved shape minimizes interaction of the intrinsic radioactivity in the pmts with the scintillation volume while maintaining light collection efficiency for decay events in the sample volume .",
    "this section presents the basis for the initial shield development and concludes with a detailed description of the shield design that leads to a more refined background estimation .",
    "the nature of low - background measurements necessitates the shielding design follow a set of guiding principles .",
    "the starting point for shielding gamma rays in any system is using a high - density material , often lead , to block external gamma rays from the detector .",
    "the decay of @xmath16pb and daughters , however , induces a bremsstrahlung background within the lead shield . in low - background systems , high purity oxygen - free high - conductivity ( ofhc ) copper is often used as a liner inside the lead shielding to attenuate the bremsstrahlung radiation .",
    "the amount of ofhc copper needed to reduce the induced bremsstrahlung background is reduced by inserting a layer of low - background lead into the shield design .",
    "a combination of these shielding materials will create an effective shield against gamma backgrounds .",
    "shielding against cosmic - ray by - products ( protons , neutrons , and muons ) is best accomplished by locating the system underground .",
    "the first few meters of overburden will screen - out protons , but tens of meters of overburden are required to reduce the cosmic - ray - induced neutron flux to a level at or below the level of neutrons emitted by the surrounding rock .",
    "the environmental neutrons produced through @xmath17 reactions of u and th chains in the surrounding rock and concrete , as well as those from the spallation of cosmic - ray by - products , are reduced using a combination of a neutron moderator ( water or polyethylene ) and a neutron absorbent material ( boron or cadmium ) .",
    "the muon background can not be removed by introducing absorbing materials or moderators . instead , scintillation panels are used as an active veto to tag counts coincident with muon events .",
    "ideally these scintillation panels provide complete 4@xmath18 coverage and are sufficiently thick to provide energy discrimination between muons passing through the plastic and environmental 2615  kev gamma - rays .",
    "this is typically accomplished with 2@xmath19-thick plastic scintillator panels .",
    "given the above general low background design principles , prior designs of low background systems were considered as points of reference for the ulb lsc development .",
    "there are two existing low background shields in the pnnl shallow underground lab that have had sufficient data collection to draw some inferences on design choices .",
    "an array of fourteen high - purity germanium ( hpge ) detectors ( cascades ) ( @xcite ) is used for sample counting and is housed within a necessarily large lead shield .",
    "it has been observed there are neutron scattering features in the hpge spectra collected from the instrument .",
    "it is believed the amount of lead present in the shield is acting as a spallation target for muons , producing the high - energy neutrons that are seen in the hpge detector array .",
    "thus , if it is possible to maintain a compact shield with only the minimum required lead thickness , it is possible to limit the muon - produced neutron background ( @xcite ) .",
    "the activation of copper has been a deterrent to using an inner copper liner for bremsstrahlung shielding in some low - background systems ( @xcite ) .",
    "while these concerns may be valid for surface level systems , simulations with high energy spallation neutrons have yielded the copper activation levels shown in table  [ tab : cuactlevels ] for a depth of 75  mwe ( @xcite ) .",
    "these numbers show that the background rate from copper activation is small relative to the other contributors .",
    "in addition , placing a 2.5-cm - thick ofhc copper shield inside the cascades system lowered the overall background level observed in the hpge crystals .",
    "it was concluded that the addition of the copper shield helped to mitigate the bremsstrahlung photon background from the lead ( @xcite ) without adding an additional background component . the low activation levels and",
    "clear shielding benefits of using an inner copper layer promoted the incorporation of an inner copper shield into the ulb lsc .",

    "it is believed this accounts for a residual several dozen counts per day in each proportional counter operated in this shield .",
    "this confirms the principle of when feasible , ensure a nearly full coverage by plastic scintillator panels .",
    "second , the proportional counter array was used to make a measurement of the neutron flux within the shield by filling a proportional counter with @xmath3he .",
    "this resulted in a thermal neutron flux measurement of @xmath29  neutrons/@xmath30/second ( @xcite ) .",
    "the proportional counter shield is _ very _ similar to the shield plan for the ulb lsc system and thus the neutron flux measurement provides a method for estimating the expected thermal neutron - induced background rate . since the proportional counter array employs 2@xmath19-thick , 30% borated polyethylene sheets to moderate and absorb neutrons , the ulb lsc shield should use at minimum these same features to reach a neutron flux similar to that measured in the proportional counter shield .      to inform the thicknesses of the graded shield layers ,",
    "simple geant4 simulations were performed to assess the backgrounds produced by the room gamma - ray background , @xmath16pb activity in the lead shield , and a low background photomultiplier tube .",

    "the geant4 radioactive decay and low energy electromagnetic processes are employed to create sources of background within the geometric model of the ulb lsc shield , described in section  [ subsec : simgeo ] .",

    "<S> liquid scintillation counting is especially useful for measuring charged particle ( e.g. , @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) emitting isotopes with no ( or very weak ) gamma - ray yields . </S>",
    "<S> the combination of high - efficiency detection of charged particle emission in a liquid scintillation cocktail coupled with the low - background environment of an appropriately - designed shield located in a clean underground laboratory provides the opportunity for increased - sensitivity measurements of a range of isotopes . to take advantage of the 35 meters - water - equivalent overburden of the underground laboratory , </S>",
    "<S> a series of simulations have evaluated the scintillation counter s shield design requirements to assess the possible background rate achievable . </S>",
    "<S> this report presents the design and background evaluation for a shallow underground , low background liquid scintillation counter design for sample measurements .    </S>",
