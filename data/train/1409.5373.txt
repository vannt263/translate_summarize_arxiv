    "in our experiment we create an effectively 2d system by means of a tight axial confinement along the @xmath85-direction .",

    "both parameters uniquely determine the effective 2d scattering length @xmath1 of the system . in our measurements",
    "@xmath88 is constant and we tune @xmath1 by changing @xmath86 via a magnetic feshbach resonance . unlike in 3d , there is a two - body bound state for all interaction strengths in two dimensions . in the bcs limit ( @xmath89 ) ,",
    "it is weakly bound and the size of the dimers , which is on the order of @xmath1 , is much larger than @xmath88 .",
    "thus , the dimers have a 2d character . on the contrary ,",
    "in the bec limit the dimers are much smaller than @xmath88 .",
    "they are thus not influenced by the axial confinement , and internally have a 3d character .",
    "however , the behavior of the dimers can be described in the 2d framework regardless of their internal structure . in particular , the scattering processes in this system can be mapped onto those of purely two - dimensional interactions .",
    "we review here the concepts of 2d scattering length and confinement induced two - body bound state",
    ".    * 2d scattering length . * the 2d scattering length @xmath1 is defined from low - energy scattering of particles @xcite . for this purpose",
    "we consider the scattering amplitude of two atoms with relative momentum @xmath90 and energy @xmath91 colliding in the continuum above the ground state of the harmonic oscillator in @xmath85-direction .",
    "for sufficiently low @xmath92 we have @xmath93 and higher excitations in the @xmath85-direction do not affect the collision .",
    "this regime is experimentally relevant here for all magnetic fields since @xmath94 .",
    "the scattering amplitude for atoms then reads @xmath95 with @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "this formula is valid for all values of @xmath96 as long as @xmath92 is sufficiently low @xcite . in particular , from the definition of the 2d scattering length @xmath1 according to @xmath97 $ ] for @xmath98 we deduce @xmath99 for all magnetic field values .",
    "this definition includes the underlying three - dimensionality of the scattering events up to the two - body sector .    in the weak confinement limit ( @xmath100 ) realized far on the bec side , we obtain @xmath101 which constitutes an energy - independent effective coupling constant .",
    "this is the expected low - energy limiting behavior for a short ranged potential whose range @xmath102 is much smaller than @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "expression ( [ a2d3 ] ) can be used to compare the molecules on the bec side to two - dimensional bosons with coupling constant @xmath103 by replacing @xmath104 @xcite and @xmath105 .",
    "we then obtain @xmath106 for @xmath107 g , demonstrating that the fermionic system realizes strongly coupled two - dimensional bosons in this limit .",
    "( [ a2d2 ] ) for the 2d scattering length has been employed for the whole crossover in ref .",

    "* confinement induced bound state . * the confinement along the @xmath85-direction induces a two - body bound state with binding energy @xmath108 for all values of the 3d scattering length @xmath86 .",
    "the corresponding binding energy @xmath108 is found from @xcite @xmath109 from the binding energy an associated length scale @xmath110 can be defined according to @xmath111 .",
    "this length scale can be used to quantify the interactions of the system .",
    "however , only far on the bcs side of the crossover , where @xmath112 and the internal structure of the dimer is two - dimensional , this length scale coincides with the 2d scattering length .    this limit is reached for magnetic fields @xmath113 g .",
    "far on the bec side , in contrast , @xmath108 approaches the binding energy of the 3d system since the size of dimer is much smaller than @xmath88 and thus the effect of the strong confinement on the dimer vanishes .",
    "the difference between @xmath1 and @xmath110 reaches almost three orders of magnitude at @xmath107 g .",
    "the interaction strengths at the critical temperature using both definitions are listed in table i.    far on the bec side ( @xmath114 ) , the critical temperature can be computed from the theory of weakly coupled two - dimensional bosons .",

    "we start our experimental sequence by transferring a 3d fermi gas of @xmath8li atoms in states @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xcite from a magneto - optical trap into an optical dipole trap ( odt ) .",
    "this surfboard - shaped trap has an aspect ratio of @xmath117:@xmath118:@xmath119:@xmath120:@xmath121 and is far red detuned ( @xmath122 nm ) from the optical transition .",
    "the gas is then evaporatively cooled into degeneracy at a magnetic offset field of @xmath14 g on the bec side of the broad feshbach resonance at @xmath123 g @xcite .",
    "we therefore obtain a 3d molecular bose - einstein condensate ( mbec ) consisting of about @xmath124 molecules with negligible thermal fraction .",
    "this sample is finally transferred into a standing - wave optical dipole trap ( swt ) as illustrated in fig .",
    "1a in the main text .",
    "the swt is created by two elliptical focused @xmath125 nm gaussian beams , which intersect under an angle of @xmath126 .",
    "this leads to a standing wave interference pattern where the maxima have a distance of @xmath127 m .",
    "the ellipticity of the beams is chosen such that the interference maxima have a circular symmetry in the xy - plane . at the position of the swt",
    ", the magnetic offset field has a saddle point .",
    "it leads to an additional weak magnetic confinement ( anti - confinement ) in radial ( axial ) direction .",
    "the measured trap frequency of the magnetic confinement in radial direction is @xmath128}$ ] . at a magnetic offset field of @xmath14 g ,",
    "the combined trapping frequencies for the central layers of the swt are given in the main text and lead to an aspect ratio of @xmath129 . in order to align the relative position of the atoms in the odt with one layer of the swt",
    ", we apply a magnetic field gradient in z - direction , which can shift the atoms up or down in the odt . to optimize the fraction of atoms transferred into this single layer",
    ", we furthermore decrease the vertical size of the atoms in the odt by modulating the position of the odt in the transverse x - direction on a time scale much faster than all trapping frequencies .",
    "this creates a time averaged potential where the width of the trap in x - direction is increased by a factor of approximately 5 . in order to further reduce the extension in z - direction of the sample , we ramp to a magnetic offset field of @xmath130 g over @xmath131ms",
    "this reduces the repulsive interaction and thus the size of the sample . after the transfer into the swt , we ramp back to @xmath14 g , where we further evaporatively cool the sample by simultaneously applying a magnetic field gradient and lowering the trap depth",
    "this also allows us to control the total number of particles .    in order to access higher temperatures in a controlled fashion",
    ", we can then apply a heating procedure . for the lowest three temperatures , we hold the sample in the swt at @xmath14 g for a variable time ( @xmath132s ) during which it is heated by technical noise . for higher temperatures",
    ", we parametrically heat the sample by modulating the depth of the swt with variable amplitude . after letting the sample equilibrate for @xmath133ms , we ramp the magnetic offset field to the value we want to investigate , where we wait for an additional @xmath134ms before probing the system .",
    "all magnetic field ramps are performed with ramp speeds @xmath135g / ms . to ensure adiabaticity of the magnetic field ramps , we compare the temperature of a sample held at an offset field of @xmath136 g to the temperature of a sample which was ramped across the feshbach resonance to @xmath137 g and back in the same time .",
    "we find that for this ramp speed the two temperatures agree within their uncertainties .",
    "all magnetic field ramps are thus adiabatic , and we probe the crossover in an isentropic way .",
    "in order to probe the distribution in the layers of the swt , we use a radio - frequency tomography technique .",
    "we apply a magnetic field gradient along the z - axis to make the transition frequency @xmath138 between states @xmath10 and @xmath139 spatially dependent on z. the dependence of @xmath138 on the magnetic field is given by @xmath140khz / g .",
    "we can thus visualize the density distribution by counting the number of transferred atoms as a function of the transition frequency . to minimize the line width of the transition , we need to exclude interaction effects and three - body losses .",
    "hence , we first remove the particles in state @xmath9 by applying a resonant laser pulse for about @xmath141s . to minimize heating and losses ,",
    "this is done at a magnetic offset field of @xmath142 g , where the atoms are not bound into molecules at our temperatures and interactions are comparatively weak .",
    "although we still observe significant heating , the thermal energy is small compared to the trap depth and it is therefore not expected that particles get transferred between the individual layers . after a ramp back to @xmath14 g , we apply a magnetic field gradient of approximately @xmath143g / cm along the z - axis .",
    "we thus achieve a difference of approximately @xmath144hz in transition frequency between atoms in neighboring layers .",
    "we then drive the @xmath10-@xmath139 transition and record the number of transferred particles using state - selective absorption imaging along the y - axis as a function of frequency ( see fig .",
    "s[fig : figures1 ] ) .",
    "[ ! htb ]    the large central maximum at @xmath145mhz in fig .",
    "s[fig : figures1 ] corresponds to atoms in the central layer .",
    "note that only a fraction of atoms is transferred to state @xmath139 , and thus the displayed atom number is considerably lower than the total atom number in the trap .",
    "the neighboring layers lie at roughly @xmath146mhz and @xmath147mhz which was confirmed in previous measurements where several layers were filled . by repeating the tomographic measurement",
    ", we can assure that the position of the layers is stable within a range of @xmath148 over time scales of more than a week .",
    "we fit the distribution shown in fig .",
    "s[fig : figures1 ] with three gaussian profiles of the same width and thus estimate the fraction of atoms in the non - central peaks to be @xmath149% .",
    "note that this value is a conservative upper bound and overestimates the number of atoms in the non - central layer for two reasons : the magnetic field gradient applied during the measurement tilts the trap and thus removes a large percentage ( approximately @xmath150% ) of all atoms before the transition is driven .",
    "since the central layer is filled with more atoms and to higher energies than the surrounding layers , a greater fraction of atoms will be lost from the central layer .",
    "in addition , the atom numbers detected in the non - central peaks are at the detection limit , and are thus influenced by phenomena such as dispersive non - resonant interactions between the imaging light and atoms in state @xmath10 .",
    "the phase space density of atoms in the non - central layers is low , and we therefore expect them to follow a thermal distribution . hence , their influence on the measured condensate fraction , peak condensate density and temperature is negligible .",
    "however , the in situ density distribution may be influenced .",
    "this is discussed in section [ subsec : systematic_errors ] .",
    "in contrast to theory , where the dimensionality of a system can easily be set , experimental realizations of low dimensionality will always remain an approximation .",
    "for instance , a two - dimensional system can be realized by strongly confining particles in one of the three spatial dimensions .",
    "however , there will always be a residual influence of the third dimension .",
    "its magnitude can be determined by comparing the relevant energy scales of the system ( the temperature @xmath55 , the chemical potential @xmath151 and dimer binding energy @xmath38 ) to the axial oscillator energy @xmath39 . for @xmath152 , particles populate the axially excited trap levels .",
    "we ensure the absence of a significant population of these excited levels by performing a measurement which is explained below .",
    "this includes the center - of - mass motion of atom pairs .",
    "however , depending on the dimer binding energy @xmath38 the internal structure of atom pairs can be three - dimensional . for @xmath24 ,",
    "the internal structure of the pairs is 2d . for @xmath153 ,",
    "the pairs are deeply bound and their internal 3d structure is not resolved . hence , only for @xmath25 which in our system occurs at an interaction strength @xmath154 , the internal structure of the pairs might affect the behavior of the system .    estimating this effect is complicated :",
    "a theoretical treatment beyond the two - body sector is extremely difficult due to strong interactions , and experimental studies would require even larger trap aspect ratios or smaller atom numbers , both of which are currently unfeasible .",
    "we estimate the population of axially excited states due to finite @xmath55 and @xmath151 by investigating the system s momentum distribution in the axial direction .",
    "this measurement is performed similar to the technique described in @xcite and it relies on the same principles as the previously used band - mapping technique @xcite .    [ !",
    "htb ]    we release the sample from the swt , let it expand for a time - of - flight of @xmath155ms , and measure its vertical extension . in the non - interacting limit ,",
    "atoms in the axial ground state of the trap have a gaussian wave function in the axial direction .",
    "their axial expansion can then be described by the dispersion of a gaussian wave packet , which is independent of the number of atoms in the axial ground state .",
    "s[fig : figures2 ] shows the axial width @xmath156 , which is determined from a gaussian fit to the density distribution , as a function of the number of prepared atoms per spin state @xmath157 in the weakly interacting fermi regime at @xmath158 g and at the coldest attainable temperature .",
    "one observes that the axial width is independent of the number of atoms up to approximately @xmath159 atoms per spin state . for @xmath160",
    "the axial width starts to increase with growing @xmath157 .",
    "this change in behavior indicates population of the axially excited states , where the atoms have additional momentum in axial direction .",
    "the obtained critical atom number @xmath161 is in agreement with the expectations for a trap with the given aspect ratio and anharmonicities . by keeping the atom number below @xmath161",
    ", we can thus ensure that for the investigated temperature only a negligible fraction of atoms populates the axial excited state .",
    "this measurement is performed in the fermionic regime , where due to the pauli principle multiple occupation of trap levels is suppressed .",
    "all other measurements presented here are performed at lower magnetic fields , closer to the bosonic limit ( @xmath162 ) .",
    "the measurement performed at @xmath158 g ( @xmath163 ) thus represents an upper bound on the fraction of particles in the axially excited states as for lower fields the atoms tend to form molecules which occupy lower energy states .    to ensure the absence of a significant amount of axial excitations also for lower magnetic fields and higher temperatures , we make use of the relation between the radial size of a harmonically trapped gas and the energy of the highest occupied oscillator level .",
    "we compare the radial size of each sample to that of the measurement at @xmath158 g , where we have excluded significant population of axially excited states . for this comparison",
    ", we estimate the radial fermi radius @xmath164 by the radius where the particle density reaches the noise floor for a particle number @xmath161 at a magnetic field of @xmath158 g",
    ". then we integrate the number of particles outside this radius . in this way",
    ", we obtain @xmath165 , an estimate for the number of particles whose energy is larger than @xmath39 . assuming that all degrees of freedom are equally occupied , the number of particles in axially excited states is given by @xmath166 .",
    "we find that @xmath167 for all interactions strengths below @xmath168 and temperatures below @xmath169 .",
    "furthermore , for all @xmath170 , the fraction of axially excited particles is @xmath171 .",
    "note that this estimate for the axially excited fraction is conservative , as it assumes constant trap frequencies .",
    "it does not take into account that the radial trap frequency decreases by up to about @xmath172% when the magnetic field is decreased to @xmath28 g .",
    "this leads to an increase in the corresponding fermi radius by up to approximately @xmath120% , and to a corresponding overestimation of @xmath173 .",
    "we have thus measured the phase diagram of a quasi-2d system with small but finite influence of the third dimension .",
    "this influence has to be considered when comparing the experimental data to true 2d predictions .",
    "recent theoretical work shows that these effects influence the system and can lead to a higher critical temperature @xcite .",
    "in order to probe the momentum distribution of the sample , we use the combination of an interaction quench and a matter wave focusing technique described in detail in the main text and in @xcite .",
    "we turn off the optical swt , and let the sample expand ballistically in the weak magnetic potential , which is confining in the radial direction . due to the harmonic shape of this potential , the in situ momentum distribution of the 2d sample is mapped to a spatial distribution after an expansion time of @xmath174 . in our case , @xmath175hz , which leads to @xmath46ms .    to obtain the actual in situ momentum distribution",
    ", it is fundamentally important that interactions are negligible while the gas is expanding , since they would result in a redistribution of momentum . due to its large aspect ratio",
    ", our sample expands rapidly in z - direction .",
    "thus , its density drops rapidly and interactions between the expanding particles are quenched .",
    "however , for large interactions strengths there is still residual scattering , which can affect the obtained momentum distribution .",
    "we thus minimize the interactions by quickly ramping to the lowest accessible interaction strength on the bec side ( @xmath28 g ) on a timescale shorter than @xmath37s just before releasing the sample from the swt .",
    "this procedure leads to a negligible scattering rate during the expansion @xcite and projects correlated pairs of atoms onto tightly bound molecules .",
    "the measured momentum distribution thus does not contain the relative momentum of the atoms in a pair , but only the center - of - mass momentum of the pair .",
    "thus , fermionic cooper pairs and bosonic molecules yield the same signature of enhanced low - momentum density in the pair momentum distribution . as a consequence ,",
    "information about the tan contact @xcite can not be obtained from the pair momentum distribution .",
    "we validate that this method does not alter the temperature of the system by comparing the momentum distributions obtained with and without the interaction quench both below ( @xmath136 g ) and above ( @xmath176 g ) the resonance . in both cases",
    "the observed temperature are consistent within the experimental uncertainties .",
    "furthermore , we confirm that the measured non - gaussian fraction @xmath75 remains unchanged for low magnetic fields where pairs are deeply bound .",
    "this is achieved by comparing data with and without the magnetic field ramp . for high magnetic fields",
    "however , we can not directly access @xmath75 without projecting correlated pairs into molecules .",
    "we thus need to make sure that we probe the properties of the interacting system at the original magnetic field , i.e. that the sample does not adapt to the interaction strengths at lower magnetic fields during and after the ramp . to estimate this effect ,",
    "we prepare a sample at @xmath137 g at a high temperature where we expect @xmath177 and perform the rapid ramp without releasing the sample from the trap .",
    "we find that it takes more than @xmath178ms for the momentum distribution to adapt to the interaction strength at the new magnetic field value of @xmath28 g and develop a non - gaussian fraction .",
    "this is two orders of magnitude larger than the timescale of the rapid ramp ( @xmath179s ) .",
    "hence , the influence of the rapid ramp technique on the measured quantities can be neglected .",
    "we use absorption imaging along the z - axis ( see fig.1 , main text ) to determine the integrated column density @xmath180 . to obtain a reasonable signal - to - noise ratio",
    "we set the imaging intensity to @xmath181 .",
    "thus , for zero detuning one obtains @xcite @xmath182 where @xmath183 is the transmitted intensity after the atomic cloud , @xmath184 is the initial intensity before the atomic cloud , @xmath185 is the effective saturation intensity , @xmath186 is the effective scattering cross section and the optical density @xmath187 is defined as @xmath188 .    due to the uniform intensity distribution of the imaging beam at the position of the atoms , @xmath189 is independent of @xmath190 and @xmath191 to a good approximation . in order to calibrate @xmath192",
    ", we take several subsequent data sets of a pure atomic sample at @xmath193{g}$ ] both with our regular imaging settings and with a @xmath194{db}$ ] attenuated imaging intensity .",
    "we then use equation ( [ eq : imagingrewrite ] ) and adjust @xmath192 such that the rhs yields the same result both for the regular and the low - intensity setting . averaging over the data sets",
    "then results in @xmath195 .",
    "the systematic uncertainties are estimated by the minimum and maximum @xmath192 obtained for the individual data sets .",
    "this leads to a systematic uncertainty of @xmath196 for the atom number @xmath157 and the peak density @xmath51 , and a negligible uncertainty for @xmath55 and @xmath75 .",
    "in addition , we independently measure the power of the imaging beam and thus determine the imaging intensity to be @xmath197 .",
    "this justifies using the literature value @xmath198 @xcite for @xmath186 .    on the bec - side ,",
    "the binding energy of the molecules shifts the resonance frequency which leads to a decreased detection efficiency . using in situ images at different fields",
    ", we calibrate this factor for our imaging settings . for magnetic fields below @xmath52 g , it deviates from @xmath199 and reaches @xmath200 at @xmath28 g .",
    "this leads to a systematic uncertainty of up to @xmath120% in atom number @xmath157 and peak density @xmath51 for the affected magnetic fields .",
    "more details about the systematic uncertainties can be found in section [ subsec : systematic_errors ] .",
    "the duration of our imaging pulse is @xmath201{\\mu s}$ ] . due to the small mass of @xmath8li ,",

    "we observe that all atoms are bound in molecules after this expansion experiment at all investigated temperatures for magnetic fields @xmath209 g .",
