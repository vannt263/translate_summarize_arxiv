    "inflation , as the paradigm of the early universe , has not only solved a lot of fine - tuning problems of the big bang theory , but also predicted the primordial scalar and tensor perturbations .",
    "the primordial tensor perturbations , i.e. primordial gravitational waves ( gws ) @xcite@xcite@xcite , have arisen great attentions after the bicep2 collaboration s announcement of the detection of b - mode signal in the cmb ( around @xmath1 ) @xcite , which was interpreted by them as the imprint of the primordial gws , though this result is doubtful due to the foregrounds of polarized dust emissions @xcite@xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "the detection of primordial gws would verify general relativity ( gr ) and strengthen our confidence in inflation and quantum gravity@xcite , and also put more constrains on inflation models and modified gravity at the same time . besides the cmb experiments which mainly aimed at detecting low frequencies ( @xmath2 hz ) gws , many experiments relate to higher frequencies based on other methods , such as pulsar timing array ( @xmath3 hz ) , laser interferometer detectors ( @xmath4 hz ) ,",
    "will be carried out in the coming decades . however , since the amplitude of the gws would stay constant after they are stretched outside the horizon , and decrease with the expansion of the universe after they reenter the horizon , the primordial gws with longer wavelength provide the most of opportunities for the detection @xcite",
    ". therefore , the cmb observations , especially the cmb b - mode detections , are still the most promising experiments to detect the primordial gws if they actually exist .",
    "einstein s gr is the most accepted theory of gravity .",
    "however , it might be required to modify when dealing with the inflation in the primordial universe and the accelerated expansion of the current universe . during the matter and radiation dominated era ,",
    "modified gravity has several effects on the cmb spectra , such as the lensing contribution to b - modes @xcite and the variation of propagating speed @xmath0 of primordial gws @xcite@xcite , we are especially interested in the latter in this paper , see e.g.@xcite for the case with the scalar perturbation . in gr , graviton is massless and propagates along the null geodesics , so the propagating speed @xmath0 of gws is naturally set to be unity , i.e. the speed of light .",
    "but in modified gravity , e.g. , the low - energy effective string theory with high - order corrections @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , and also modified gauss - bonnet gravity @xcite , and generalized galileon ( horndeski theory @xcite ) @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , and beyond horndeski theories @xcite,@xcite , and the effective theory of fluids at next - to - leading order in derivatives ( e.g.@xcite ) , @xmath0 might deviate from unity .",
    "because the value of @xmath0 determines the time of horizon crossing of gws , during the recombination the change of @xmath0 can result in a shift of the peak position of the primordial b - modes , see @xcite@xcite , for example .",
    "in this paper , we focus on the effect of the variation of @xmath0 during slow - roll inflation on the cmb b - mode polarization , and show how it offers a distinct way to test the modified gravity theories .",
    "we find that the step - like variation of @xmath0 may result in an oscillating modulation to the b - mode polarization spectrum , which can hardly be imitated by adjusting other cosmological parameters .",
    "the intensity of the modulation is determined by the ratio of @xmath0 before and after the variation , which depends on the dynamics of theoretical models .",
    "this oscillating modulation is so rich in feature that it may easily be discriminated from the variation of other parameters or other features .",
    "thus provided that the foreground contribution is under control , high - precision cmb polarization observations will be able to put tight constraint on the variation of @xmath0 , and so the corresponding theories .",
    "we begin with the action for the gws mode @xmath5 , e.g.@xcite@xcite s_(2)=dd^3x a^2 q_t8 , [ action2 ] where @xmath5 obeys @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath8 is regarded as effective planck scale @xmath9 , @xmath0 is the propagating speed of primordial gws , and the prime is the derivative with respect to the conformal time @xmath10 , @xmath11 . during slow - roll inflation , the slow - roll parameter @xmath12 , as well as _",
    "q = q_th q_t1 , s = c_thc_t1are required , e.g. , see @xcite for a recent study .    here",
    ", we will mainly focus on the effect of varying @xmath0 , i.e. , the condition @xmath13 might be broke at some point , on primordial gws spectrum . noting that the effects of varying sound speed of primordial scalar perturbations on the scalar power spectrum have been investigated in @xcite@xcite .",
    "we do not get entangled with the details of ( [ action2 ] ) and the evolution of background , and will assume that the background is the slow - roll inflation , which is not affected by the variation of @xmath0 , and set @xmath8 constant and @xmath14 .",
    "we will discuss a possibility of such a case in appendix a. in addition , there may be a mass term @xcite@xcite in ( [ action2 ] ) , which might also be time - dependent @xcite , but we will not involve it .",
    "we can expand @xmath5 into fourier series as @xmath15 , where _ ij(,)=_=+,^()_ij ( ) , [ hij]where the polarization tensors @xmath16 are defined by @xmath17 , @xmath18 , which satisfy @xmath19 , @xmath20 , the commutation relation for the annihilation and creation operators @xmath21 and @xmath22 is @xmath23=\\delta_{\\lambda\\lambda^{\\prime}}\\delta^{(3)}(\\mathbf{k}-\\mathbf{k}^{\\prime})$ ] .",
    "we define @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "thus we get the equation of motion for @xmath26 as u_k^+(c_t^2 k^2- ) u_k=0.[eom1 ]    to phenomenologically investigate the effect on primordial gws spectrum induced by varying @xmath0 , we assume that the variation of @xmath0 can be described by a step - like function c_t=\\ {    ll c_t1(_0 ) +    . , where @xmath27 is the transition time .",
    "we take the background evolution to be the slow - roll inflation .",
    "of course , it is also provided that the sudden change of @xmath0 wo nt affect the background evolution .",
    "then , we have @xmath28 , and the equation of motion ( [ eom1 ] ) becomes u_k^+(c_t^2 k^2- ) u_k=0,[eom2 ] where @xmath29 . the solution to eq.([eom2 ] ) is familiar , we can write it as u_k1&= & , _ 0 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the first and second kind hankel functions of @xmath32-th order , respectively .",
    "these coefficients @xmath33 are functions of the comoving wave number @xmath34 , but constants with respect to conformal time @xmath10 . @xmath35 and @xmath36 are determined by the initial condition .    here , we set the initial condition as the standard bunch - davies(bd ) vacuum .",
    "therefore , when @xmath37 , which corresponds to perturbations deep inside the horizon , u_k~e^-ic_t1k.[bd ] when @xmath38 , @xmath39 in eq.([solution ] ) should approximate to eq.([bd ] ) .",
    "allow for the hankel function @xmath40 and @xmath41 when @xmath42 , we get c_1,1=,c_1,2=0 .    the coefficients @xmath43 and @xmath44 are determined by requiring @xmath26 and @xmath45 to be continuous at @xmath46 , i.e. the matching condition",

    ", we have |u_k2|=| c_2,1-c_2,2 | .",
    "therefore , we obtain the power spectrum of primordial gws as p_t & = & _ = + , |h_(,k)|^2 = p^inf_t | c_2,1-c_2,2|^2,[spectrum ] where p^inf_t=2h_inf^2/^2 [ pgr]is that of standard slow - roll inflation without modified gravity , i.e. @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is the hubble parameter during inflation , which sets the scale of inflation .",

    "v2 ] , we see that the tt - mode spectrum is hardly affected by the oscillating primordial gws power spectrum , since the contribution of gws to tt - mode spectrum is negligible , compared with the scalar perturbations .",
    "the case of ee - mode polarization spectrum is actually also similar .",
    "thus the main effect of varying speed of primordial gws is on the b - mode polarization , which makes the b - mode polarization spectrum show its obvious enhancements or suppressions to the reionization bump and oscillations around the recombination peak .    in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the authors have pointed out that it is possible to set to one the propagating speed of gws by a proper redefinition of the metric .",
    "they got the gravitational waves spectrum in their eq.(12 )  same \" as the standard one in the form .",
    "however , since they have made a redefinition of the time coordinate and the scale factor in eq.(9 ) , the variation of their @xmath80 with respect to @xmath81 after redefinition is not the same as the variation of @xmath82 with respect to @xmath83 .",
    "therefore , the oscillating feature induced by a step - like @xmath0 is encoded in @xmath80 , the result in both frame should be the same",
    ".    it might also be a concern whether such a b - mode polarization spectrum can be imitated by adjusting other cosmological parameters or not . in eq.([tau ] ) , the optical depth @xmath78 is relevant with the height of the reionization bump .",
    "we show the bb - mode spectrum with different @xmath78 in fig.[fig : v3 ] .",
    "we see that the change of @xmath78 can only alter the overall amplitude of bb - mode spectrum at low multipoles , but hardly create the oscillation .",
    "in addition , in inflationary models with pre - inflation era , the reionization bump could also be suppressed ( e.g.@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) or enhanced ( e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "however , similarly , these models also only alter the overall amplitude of the bb - mode spectrum , without oscillation , at low multipoles .",
    "these results indicate that although the bb - mode spectrum may be modified by other ways , the oscillating modulation leaded by varying the speed of primordial gws is difficult to be imitated .",
    "thus the measure of b - mode polarization spectrum provides an appropriate way for testing the corresponding gravity physics in the primordial universe .",
    "in low - energy effective string theory and modified gravity theories , the propagating speed @xmath0 of primordial gws may deviate from unity .",
    "we calculated the spectrum of primordial gws , assuming that @xmath0 has a step - like variation and the background of slow - roll inflation is not affected by it .",

    "our paper again highlights the significance of b - mode polarization measures in exploring the fundamental physics of primordial universe .    here , we only postulate a simple step - like variation of @xmath0 , which , however , might be far complicated in some modified gravity models , as well as accompanied by the variation of @xmath8",
    ". the effect could be non - trivial in more general cases , which is under study .",
    "but in a certain sense , a smooth change of @xmath0 will induce oscillations too , see e.g.@xcite for the case of scalar perturbations , so we expect that the case of gws is similar .",
    "when we focus on the b - mode polarization spectrum , the assumption we adopted is that after inflation the propagating speed @xmath0 is unity , which may also be relaxed .",

    "the simplest extension of the lowest - order action is e.g.@xcite _ correction~- ( c_1 r_gb^2+c_2 g^ _ _ ) [ action3]where @xmath86 , and @xmath87 is the gauss - bonnet term , @xmath88 is the inverse string tension , @xmath89 is a parameter allowing for different species of string theories , @xmath90 and @xmath91 are coefficients .",
    "we have neglected the terms with @xmath92 and @xmath93 , since both do not contribute to gws .",
    "the introducing of ( [ action3 ] ) will affect not only the gws , but also the adiabatic scalar perturbations , of course , it is interesting to check its effect on the latter .",
    "however , for our purpose , we will regard @xmath94 as the spectator field , so that the effects of ( [ action3 ] ) on the background and the scalar perturbations are negligible .",

    "of course , the variation of @xmath97 could be more complicated than a step - like evolution , which would be harder to deal with .",

    "<S> we find that the step - like variation of @xmath0 during slow - roll inflation may result in an oscillating modulation to the b - mode polarization spectrum , which can hardly be imitated by adjusting other cosmological parameters , and the intensity of the modulation is determined by the dynamics of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> thus provided that the foreground contribution is under control , high - precision cmb polarization observations will be able to put tight constraint on the variation of @xmath0 , and so the corresponding theories . </S>"
