    "let @xmath3 be a closed , not necessarily convex lattice polygon and @xmath15 its interior .",
    "define @xmath16 , the possible midpoints of the inner edges of a lattice triangulation of @xmath3 .",
    "proof : the injection from @xmath17 to @xmath18 is clear . + on the other hand all unimodular triangles are @xmath19-equivalent to @xmath4-translates of @xmath20 , so they do nt contain interior points from  @xmath18 .",
    "notation : for a subcomplex @xmath21 of a triangulation of @xmath3 and @xmath22 , if there is an edge through @xmath23 in @xmath21 we denote it by @xmath24 .",
    "we use a lexicographic order on @xmath25 : @xmath26 \\mbox { or } [ y_1= y_2\\mbox { and } x_1<x_2].\\ ] ]      proof of theorem  [ thm : hay ] : + the idea is to run through @xmath18 lexicographically , and at each step to add an edge through @xmath28 .",
    "we will see that in each step there are at most two possibilities to put the new edge through @xmath23 .",
    "we proceed by induction on the totally ordered set @xmath31 , thus proving that the number of haystacks with respect to some @xmath28 is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the number of predecessors of @xmath23 in  @xmath18 .",
    "thus after the final step ( that is , after processing the largest @xmath23 in @xmath31 ) we have obtained that there are at most @xmath34 unimodular triangulations of  @xmath3 .",
    "now for some @xmath28 consider a haystack @xmath27 with respect to @xmath23 .",
    "we want to add a `` needle '' to our haystack so that the resulting subcomplex will again be a haystack .",
    "so we consider the set @xmath35 of possible endpoints @xmath36 of edges through @xmath23 , with @xmath37 : @xmath38\\}\\mbox { is a haystack } \\big \\}.\\ ] ] we want to prove that @xmath39 for all @xmath28 .",
    "we say that @xmath36 is * visible * from  @xmath23 if the edge @xmath40 $ ] crosses no other edge or integral point .",
    "consider @xmath41 as @xmath42 is visible from @xmath23 we have @xmath43 .",
    "furthermore @xmath44 holds for all @xmath45 .",
    "( see figure  [ alpha.fig ] ) .",
    "we now order @xmath46 by the angles @xmath47 of @xmath48 with the @xmath49-axis turning counter - clockwise and starting by @xmath50 , so that we have @xmath51 .",
    "indeed , we never have @xmath52 , otherwise @xmath53 would lie on a line , but then one of the two points @xmath54 would not be visible from @xmath23 , because both are @xmath55 .",
    "we say that a triangle @xmath59 $ ] is * empty * if there is no edge through it and no @xmath60-points in its interior .",
    "the triangle @xmath59 $ ] is empty as @xmath46 contains all points in @xmath61 $ ] visible from @xmath23 .",
    "the midpoint @xmath62 is half - integer , @xmath63 , as @xmath59 $ ] is empty .",
    "we also have @xmath64 , and so @xmath65 $ ] , since the triangle @xmath59 $ ] is empty .",
    "additionally it has area @xmath66 , otherwise the triangle would nt be empty .",
    "* case 1 : * suppose first that @xmath30 .",
    "+ the triangle @xmath74 $ ] is unimodular as @xmath75= \\frac{1}{2 } $ ] ; so there are no integer points between the line @xmath76 and the line @xmath72 .",
    "the edge @xmath77 has nonempty intersection with these two lines ( but does nt cross @xmath78 $ ] , since @xmath56 ) .",
    "but where could a third point @xmath79 ( other than @xmath80 ) be ?",
    "the line @xmath81 is parallel to @xmath72 , we have @xmath82 ; and @xmath83 for all @xmath42 .",
    "so all points of @xmath46 are on the same side of @xmath81 as @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "so @xmath36 is on or beyond the line @xmath72 and hence the edge through @xmath23 starting at @xmath36 would necessarily cross the edge @xmath77 .",
    "so there can be no other point @xmath36 in  @xmath35 , that is , @xmath86 .",
    "* case 2 : * the situation for @xmath87 is similar : + the edge through @xmath88 must be @xmath89 $ ] , otherwise it would cut @xmath78 $ ] or @xmath90 $ ] ; in the first case we would have @xmath91 and in the second case @xmath85 would nt be visible from  @xmath23 . and @xmath92 $ ] is again unimodular , so there is no possibility for a third @xmath42 .    our theorem 1 and its proof clearly extend to a more general situation , namely the case of a not necessarily simply connected lattice polygon ( which may have holes ) , possibly with additional , fixed inner edges .",
    "we can define the capacities @xmath93 ; see  @xcite . from sublinearity of @xmath0",
    "it follows by fekete s lemma @xcite that the limit capacities @xmath94 exist .",
    "theorem  [ thm : hay ] yields the upper bounds @xmath95 which includes the best known upper bounds for all @xmath96 ( compare @xcite ) .",
    "in generating triangulations with the `` haystack approach '' as in the proof of theorem 1 , one will in many situations have @xmath97 .",
    "so probably our upper bound @xmath98 for the limit capacity @xmath99 is not sharp ."
