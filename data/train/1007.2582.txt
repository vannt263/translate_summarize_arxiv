    "within the taxonomic system of tholen ( 1984 ) , m asteroids have featureless spectra and red spectral slope over the visible wavelength range ( 0.34  1.04 @xmath0 m ) and medium visual albedos ( 0.1  0.3 ) .",
    "tholen and barucci ( 1989 ) identify approximately 40 m - type asteroids using the tholen ( 1984 ) class definition .",
    "the m - types are presumed to be the progenitors both of differentiated iron - nickel meteorites and enstatite chondrites ( gaffey 1976 ; cloutis et al .",
    "1990 ; gaffey et al .",
    "some authors have proposed alternative meteorite linkages , such as ch , cb ( bencubbinite ) ( hardersen et al . 2005 ) , or other carbonaceous chondrites ( vilas 1994 ) .",
    "m - class albedos generally match those of nickel - iron meteorites , leading some to propose that these asteroids are the collisionally - produced fragments of differentiated metal cores ( bell et al .",
    "this interpretation requires parent bodies heated to at least 2000 @xmath6 to produce iron meteorites ( taylor , 1992 ) .",
    "however , based on recent findings , these interpretations are being challenged .",
    "polarimetric measurements ( lupisko & belskaya 1989 ) and radar observations ( ostro et al .",
    "1991 ; 2000 ; magri et al . 2007 ; shepard et al .",
    "2008 ) of selected m - type asteroids have revealed a large variety of surface properties that are in some cases inconsistent with only a metallic composition .",
    "shepard et al . ( 2008 ) , in a radar survey of 14 m - type asteroids , find that only four objects ( 16 psyche , 216 kleopatra , 758 mancunia , and 785 zwetana ) have radar albedos high enough to be dominantly metallic .",
    "+ the first estimations of the bulk density of m - asteroids 16 psyche ( 1.41.8 @xmath7 ) and 22 kalliope ( 2.4 @xmath7 ) gave values surprisingly lower than expected ( viateau 2000 ; kocheva 2003 ; britt et al .",
    "2002 ; margot & brown 2003 ) .",
    "these low densities are not consistent with predominantly metal composition , and require very high values for the bulk porosity . however , these values have been disputed and recently shepard et al .",
    "( 2008 ) estimates a very high bulk density for 16 psyche ( 7.6@xmath83.0 @xmath7 ) , more consistent with a metal composition .",
    "descamps et al .",

    "is the evidence for hydrated minerals on the surfaces of some m - type asteroids ( jones et al .",
    "1990 ; rivkin et al . 1995 ; 2000 ; 2002 ) , inferred from the identification of an absorption feature around 3 @xmath0 m typically due to the first overtone of h@xmath9o and to oh vibrational fundamentals in hydrated silicates .",
    "rivkin et al .",
    "( 1995 ; 2000 ) proposed splitting the m - types into _ wet _ w - class asteroids ( those which show the 3 @xmath0 m band ) , and _ dry _ m - class asteroids ( those which do not show the 3 @xmath0 m band ) .",
    "if the 3 @xmath0 m band on m - type asteroids is due to hydrated minerals , then these objects might not be anhydrous and igneous as previously believed and the thermal scenarios for the inner main belt may need a revision ( e.g. bell et al .",
    "gaffey et al . ( 2002 ) propose alternative explanations for the 3 @xmath0 m band : materials normally considered to be anhydrous containing structural oh ; troilite , an anhydrous mineral that shows a feature at 3 @xmath0 m , or xenolithic hydrous meteorite components on asteroid surfaces from impacts and solar wind implanted h.    recent spectroscopic observations in the visible and near infrared region show that the spectra of m asteroids are not uniformly featureless as previously believed .",
    "in addition to the 3 @xmath0 m band , faint absorption bands in the 0.9 @xmath0 m region have been identified on the surfaces of some m - type asteroids ( chapman & gaffey , 1979 ; hardersen et al . 2005 ; clark et al .",

    "six asteroids , investigated in the visible range at the ntt and tng telescopes , were separately observed in the near infrared at the mauna kea observatory 3.0 m nasa infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) in hawaii during several runs in 2004 - 2008 ( table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "our survey was devoted to the investigation of asteroids belonging to the e , m and x classes , following the tholen ( 1984 ) taxonomy . here",

    "like most of the loral ccds , the dolores chip is affected by moderate - to - strong fringing at red wavelengths . despite taking as much care as possible in the data reduction process , some asteroid spectra show residual fringing that impedes identification of absorption bands in the 0.9 @xmath0 m region .    for the infrared spectroscopic investigation at the tng telescope we used the near infrared camera and spectrometer ( nics ) equipped with an amici prism disperser .",

    "( rayner et al .",
    "spectra were recorded with a slit oriented in the north - south direction and opened to 0.8 by 15 arcseconds .",
    "a dichroic lens reducing the signal below 0.8 @xmath0 m was used for all observations .",
    "objects were consistently observed near the meridian to minimize airmass , but total integration time varied from @xmath12 6 to 30 minutes , depending on the strength of the signal relative to sky lines .",
    "visible and near - infrared spectra were reduced using ordinary procedures of data reduction with the software packages midas and idl as described in fornasier et al .",
    "( 2004a , b ) . for the visible spectra , the procedure includes the subtraction of the bias from the raw data , flat  field correction , cosmic ray removal , sky subtraction , collapsing the two  dimensional spectra to one dimension , wavelength calibration , and atmospheric extinction correction .",
    "the reflectivity of each asteroid was obtained by dividing its spectrum by that of the solar analog star closest in time and airmass to the object .",
    "spectra were finally smoothed with a median filter technique , using a box of 19 pixels in the spectral direction for each point of the spectrum .",
    "the threshold was set to 0.1 , meaning that the original value was replaced by the median value if the median value differs by more than 10% from the original one .    for observations in the infrared range ,",
    "spectra were first corrected for flat fielding , then bias and sky subtraction was performed by producing a - b and b - a frames .",
    "the positive spectrum of the b - a frame was shifted and added to the positive spectrum of the a - b frame .",
    "the final spectrum is the result of the mean of all pairs of frames previously combined .",
    "the spectrum was extracted and wavelength calibrated . for the ntt - sofi spectra , this last step was performed acquiring the spectrum in the blue and red grisms of a xenon lamp , and comparing the observed lines with those of a reference table , obtaining the dispersion relation . for the tng - nics spectra , due to the very low resolution of the amici prism ,",
    "the lines of ar / xe lamps are blended and can not be easily used for standard reduction procedures .",
    "for this reason , the wavelength calibration was obtained using a look - up table which is based on the theoretical dispersion predicted by ray - tracing and adjusted to best fit the observed spectra of calibration sources .",
    "finally , the extinction correction and solar removal was obtained by division of each asteroid spectrum by that of the solar analog star closest in time and airmass to the object . for the irtf data , after the normal data reduction procedures of flat - fielding , sky subtraction , spectrum extraction , and wavelength calibration , each spectrum was fitted with the atran atmospheric model for telluric absorption features ( lord 1992 ; bus et al . 2002a , 2003 ; sunshine et al .",
    "this procedure required an initial estimate of precipitable water in the atmospheric optical path using the zenith angle for the observation and the known @xmath13values ( average atmospheric water ) for mauna kea .",
    "this initial guess was iterated until the best fit between predicted and observed telluric band shapes was obtained , and an atmospheric model spectrum was generated ( bus et al .",
    "2003 ) . following this ,",
    "each asteroid spectrum was divided by the atmospheric model and then ratioed to each star spectrum , similarly reduced , before normalization at 1.2 @xmath0 m .",
    "the software and procedures used for data reduction are described in demeo et al .",
    "the final spectra we report are averages of 3 - 5 asteroid / star ratios , calculated to minimize variations due to standard star and sky variability .",
    "usually , 2 - 5 different standard stars were observed on any given night at the telescope .",
    "we used only `` solar '' standard stars , and each standard star was observed 1 - 3 times per night .",
    "the stellar and asteroid spectra were cross - correlated and , if necessary , sub - pixel shifts were made before ratioing the asteroid to the star .",
    "this reduction step is needed to reduce the noise and/or the changes in the final asteroid slope due to small changes in the wavelength dispersion between asteroid and star observations , introduced by instrumental flexure .",
    "the infrared and visible spectral ranges of each asteroid were finally combined by overlapping the spectra , merging the two wavelength regions at the common wavelengths and utilizing the zone of good atmospheric transmission to find the normalization factor between the two spectral parts . for the tng and irtf data the overlapping region goes from @xmath12 0.86 to 0.94 @xmath0 m , and we took the average value over the 0.89 - 0.91 @xmath0 m region of the visible spectrum to normalize the infrared spectrum . for the ntt data ,",
    "the overlapping region is very small so we took the average value over the 0.95 - 0.96 @xmath0 m region to normalize the spectra .",

    "first , a linear continuum was fitted at the edges of the band , that is at the points on the spectrum outside the absorption band being characterized",
    ". then the asteroid spectrum was divided by the linear continuum and the region of the band was fitted with a polynomial of order 2 or more .",
    "the band center was then calculated as the position where the minimum of the spectral reflectance curve occurs , and the band depth as the minimum in the ratio of the spectral reflectance curve to the fitted continuum ( see table  [ band ] ) .",

    "to constrain the possible mineralogies of our asteroids ( those with both visible and near infrared spectra ) , we conducted a search for meteorite and/or mineral spectral analogs .",
    "we used the publicly available relab spectrum library ( pieters 1983 ) , which consisted of nearly 15,000 spectra in november of 2008 . for each spectrum in the library ,",
    "a filter was applied to find relevant wavelengths ( 0.4 to 2.45 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "then , a second filter was applied to reject spectra with irrelevant albedo values ( i.e. brightness at 0.55 @xmath0 m too high or too low ) .",
    "this process produced a list of approximately 4000 relab spectra of appropriate brightness and wavelength coverage for comparison to the asteroid .",
    "relab spectra were normalized to 1.0 at 0.55 @xmath0 m , and then a chi - squared value was calculated relative to the normalized input asteroid spectrum .",
    "we used the asteroid wavelength sampling to resample the laboratory spectra by linear interpolation .",
    "this allowed a least - squares calculation with the number of points equal to the wavelength sampling of the asteroid spectrum .",
    "the relab data files were sorted according to chi - squared , and then visually examined for dynamic weighting of spectral features by the spectroscopist . given similar chi - squared values , a match that mimicked spectral features was preferred over a match that did not .",
    "we visually examined the top 50 chi - squared matches for each asteroid .",
    "no specific grain - size sampling filter was applied , and many of the best matches found were of slab or sanded slab ( or rough - cut ) surfaces .",
    "the importance of our second filter is that we constrained the search for analogs to those laboratory spectra with brightness ( reflectance at 0.55 @xmath0 m ) roughly comparable to the albedo of the asteroid . for the asteroid albedo value",
    ", we generally used the iras albedo published by tedesco et al .",
    "for the darker asteroids ( below 10% albedo ) , this is a fairly well - known number .",
    "the uncertainty for brighter asteroid albedos ( above 10% albedo ) is relatively larger .",
    "this is because at equivalent geocentric and heliocentric distances , a darker asteroid will have stronger thermal flux , allowing a more precise and more accurate albedo determination . to account for this , we filtered out lab spectra if brightness differed by more than @xmath8 3% in absolute albedo for the darker asteroids in our sample ( albedo less than 10% ) , and we filtered out lab spectra if brightness differed by more than @xmath8 5% in absolute albedo for the brighter asteroids ( albedos greater than 10% ) .",
    "for example , if an asteroid s albedo was 20% , we searched over all lab spectra with 0.55 @xmath0 m reflectance between 15% and 25% . if an asteroid s albedo was 7% , we searched over all lab spectra with reflectance between 4% and 10% .",
    "once the brightness filter was applied , all materials were normalized before comparison by least - squares .",
    "we note that mismatches between asteroid albedo and meteorite 0.55 @xmath0 m reflectance occurs for a few well - known meteorite - asteroid pairings , such as vesta ( albedo about 40% ) and heds ( many of which have 0.55 micron reflectances of 25 - 30% ) .",
    "the last filter to be applied was a `` no lunar sample '' filter , and this will be explained further in the next section .",
    "our search techniques effectively emphasized the spectral characteristics of brightness and shape , and de - emphasized minor absorption bands and other parametric characteristics .",
    "[ here table 5 ]    [ here figures 6 , 7 and 8 ]    the best matches between our observed sample and meteorites ( from the relab database ) are reported in table  [ tab ] and in figs  [ fig6 ] ,  [ fig7 ] , and  [ fig8 ] .",
    "most best matches resulted in iron meteorites ( i m ) , pallasites ( pall ) , or enstatite chondrites ( ec ) , as suggested in the literature for the m - type asteroids .",
    "some meteorite matches are quite good , while for some asteroids ( 16 psyche , 22 kalliope , 69 hesperia , 216 kleopatra 755 quintilla , 872 holda ) the best meteorite match we found does not satisfactorily reproduce both the visual and near infrared spectral behavior",
    ". the relab spectral library does not contain cb meteorite spectra , so the suggested analogue of cb bencubbinites ( hardersen et al . 2005 ) remains spectrally untested .",
    "in contrast , the relab spectral library contains many samples of other carbonaceous chondrites , only one of which was found as a best match in this study ( 498 tokio was best fit with a cv carbonaceous chondrite , but its albedo is anomalously low ( 7% ) within the m class ) .",
    "this would seem to provide evidence against the suggestion of vilas ( 1994 ) that carbonaceous chondrites are analogues for the m - type asteroids .",
    "in fact , cv chondrites are usually associated with k - type asteroids ( moth - diniz et al .",
    "2008 ; clark et al .",
    "2009 ) , or with b - type asteroids ( clark et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "the only asteroid to result in an enstatite chondrite best match is 161 athor .",
    "neither the asteroid nor the enstatite chondrites ( in general ) show absorption features , so the match is purely based on spectral slope and albedo .",
    "iron meteorites matched both featureless asteroids ( 69 hesperia , 97 klotho , 224 oceana , 325 heidelberga , 849 ara ) and asteroids with bands ( 16 psyche , 216 kleopatra , 110 lydia , 135 hertha , 338 budrosa , 347 pariana , 369 aeria , 860 ursina , and 872 holda ) .",
    "in particular , we note that relab file c1mb46 ( of the iron meteorite landes which has silicate inclusions ) was selected as a best fit for 5 different asteroids ( 135 hertha , 224 oceana , 347 pariana , 22 kalliope , and 872 holda ) .",
    "this spectrum shows a faint absorption band at 0.9 @xmath0 m , probably due to the silicate inclusions . of concern , of course , is the fact that this sample was measured as a slab , not as a particulate .",
    "pallasites were the best matches for 785 zwetana ( no bands ) , 110 lydia , 250 bettina , 22 kalliope , and 55 pandora ( all with bands ) .",
    "several asteroid matches resulted in different relab spectral files ( c1mb43 , ckmb43 , and cmmb43 ) of the same meteorite , the stony - iron pallasite esquel .",
    "the differences between these spectra are that c1mb43 is of a sanded metal area on an esquel slab , measured from one incidence angle , while cmmb43 is of the same sanded area measured from two different incidence angle directions ( averaged ) , and ckmb43 is a metal - rich powder of the meteorite with a grain size less than 63 @xmath0 m . in a recent paper , cloutis et al .",
    "( 2010 ) study in detail the physical reasons for the spectral differences observed as a function of sample preparation .",
    "this example illustrates a typical issue with a library database search .",
    "the same sample can look spectrally different depending on measurement illumination and grain size circumstances .",
    "such spectral differences result not from compositional differences , but from measurement circumstances .",
    "this indicates that the spectral differences between the asteroids found to match these meteorites ( 110 lydia , 22 kalliope , and 55 pandora ) , are insignificant according to the spectral library .",
    "we note that the peculiar object 516 amherstia ( which we have suggested be reclassified as an s - type ) was found to be similar to a laser - irradiated ordinary chondrite ( oc ) .",
    "similarly , asteroid 441 bathilde was best fit with a laser - irradiated sample of olivine . unlike 516 amherstia , 441 bathilde",
    "does not show absorption features , so the spectral match is based on slopes , shape , and brightness only .",
    "nevertheless , we note with amusement that highly space weathered materials can not be ruled out as a surface composition for 441 bathilde , based on the excellent agreement between the asteroid and the laboratory spectra of a simulated weathered olivine .",
    "m - type asteroid spectra , being largely featureless , were very often fit with a lunar soil sample during the automated part of our relab search .",
    "for example , 55 pandora , which has a band at 0.9 @xmath0 m , was well fit with relab file csls65 , which is a spectrum of apollo program sample 61221,114 , a lunar highland soil from the apollo 16 landing site .",
    "like m - type asteroids , lunar soils tend to be very steeply spectrally sloped . when they are most mature ( highly space - weathered ) , lunar soils tend to show only very minor silicate absorption features , like m - type asteroids .",
    "thus , without applying a `` no lunar sample '' filter in our search , we would have been led to the conclusion that some m - type asteroids are covered with lunar - soil - like materials .    in sum ,",
    "our method of searching for meteorite analogues emphasized the spectral characteristics of brightness and shape , and de - emphasized minor absorption bands .",
    "automated chi - squared algorithms will always result in such an emphasis .",
    "we attempted to account for this by selecting fits with good band mimickry over poor band mimickry when chi - squared values were comparable , however there are some cases where weak ( 1 - 2% ) bands are not faithfully matched ( e.g. 110 lydia ) .",
    "only spacecraft mission sample returns will ultimately allow us to answer the question `` could a featureless iron meteorite be considered an analogue of an asteroid which has a band ? ''      [ here table 6 ]    [ here figure 9 ]    we ran a spearman rank correlation ( spearman 1904 ) to search for possible correlations between our sample s spectral characteristics and their orbital and physical parameters .",
    "the spearman correlation function gives a two - element vector containing the rank correlation coefficient ( @xmath22 ) and the two - sided significance of its deviation from zero ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath22 varies between -1 and 1 ; if @xmath24 is close to zero , then there is no correlation and if @xmath24 is close to 1 , then a correlation exists .",
    "the significance ( @xmath23 ) is a value in the interval @xmath25 .",
    "a small value indicates a significant correlation .",
    "we consider a strong correlation to have @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and a weak correlation to have @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "our sample includes 29 asteroids observed in the visible range .",
    "we eliminated 516 amherstia from all further analysis because spectral properties diverge completely from all others .",
    "in fact , it displays strong 0.9 and 1.9 @xmath0 m features , putting it into the sq - class in the bus - demeo system .",
    "23 asteroids were observed both in the visible and near infrared range .",
    "we analyse the whole sample as well as the subsamples we consider most likely to be the most metal rich ( those without the 0.9 @xmath0 m absorption band ) and those containing silicates , presenting the 0.9 @xmath0 m band , and belonging to the xk type in the bus - demeo taxonomy .",
    "among our spearman rank correlation test results , we find weak anti - correlations between the slopes @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , and the asteroids rotational period ( table  [ stat ] ) .",
    "belskaya & lagerkvist ( 1996 ) found that m  asteroids have a faster mean rotational period compared to s and c type asteroids .",
    "they interpreted this as an indication of an higher mean density that allows m  asteroids to survive energetic collisions without disruption , which increases their rotational angular momentum .",
    "one possible explanation is that fast rotators have a higher density , so they have a composition metal rich , which is characterized by steeper spectral slope .",
    "the slow m - type rotators may have a smaller mean density and so a smaller amount of metals in their composition , which is characterized by a less steep spectral slope .",
    "from our spearman rank correlation tests , there also appear to be significant correlations between slope and semi - major axis , and albedo ( table  [ stat ] ) . the continuum slope ( @xmath14 ) and the 1.1 - 1.6 @xmath0 m slope ( @xmath32 )",
    "are correlated with semi - major axis @xmath33 , while the slope in the visible range ( @xmath34 ) is only weakly correlated with @xmath33 ( fig .  [ fignn ] ) .",
    "asteroids in our sample with the 0.9 @xmath0 m feature show a correlation between @xmath14 versus @xmath33 , and a weaker corelation between @xmath32 versus @xmath33 . it must be noted that our sample size is small .    considering all 29 asteroids in our sample ,",
    "a weak anti - correlation exists between the @xmath34 and the albedo , in particular the anti - correlation becomes stronger for asteroids not showing the silicatic band at 0.9 @xmath0 m .",
    "so the visual slope tends to increase with decreasing albedo .",
    "the correlation of the continuum slope to the semi - major axis together with the anti correlation of the visible slope to albedo indicates that our sample derived from tholen m - type asteroids tend to be dark in albedo and red in near - infrared slope with increasing semi - major axis .",
    "this is true in particular for featureless subset of our sample that we consider most likely to be iron rich .",
    "darkening of albedo plus reddening of the slope is a typical effect of space weathering seen on lunar samples and silicate rich asteroids . using statistical arguments , lazzarin et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have shown that space weathering probably occurs on all asteroid types .",
    "nevertheless , space weathering effects have not been fully investigated for metallic rich surfaces .",
    "if space weathering acts on m - type asteroids as it does with s type asteroids , then asteroids that are closer to the sun might be expected to show stronger spectral changes because of the higher abundance of solar wind ions .",
    "our results indicate an opposite trend .",
    "a few measurements exist on the effect of space weathering on enstatite chondrite and iron and stony iron meteorites ( e.g. vernazza et al .",
    ". an irradiated sample of the eagle enstatite chondrite meteorite revealed a slight reddening of the spectral slope and no more than 3% darkening of the visual albedo .",
    "for the vaca muerta mesosiderite meteorite vernazza et al .",
    "( 2009 ) found again a reddening in the spectral slope and a darkening of the visual albedo .",
    "grain size effects can play an important role in the slope changes as well .",
    "britt and pieters ( 1988 ) studied the bidirectional reflectance properties of some iron - nickel meteorites for different surface roughness .",
    "they found that the spectra of m - type asteroids show good agreement with those of iron meteorites with surface features in the range of 10 @xmath0 m to 1 mm , that is larger that the wavelength of incident light .",
    "meteorites with these roughness values are diffuse reflectors and show the classic red slope continuum of iron , with pratically no geometric dependence on reflection .",
    "on the other hand , a decreasing of the meteorite surface roughness changes the reflectance characteristics : complex scattering behaviour is seen for roughness in the 0.7 - 10 @xmath0 m range , while for roughness values @xmath35",
    "0.7 @xmath0 m the reflectance is characterised by two distinct components , the specular one which is bright and red sloped , and the nonspecular one which is dark and flat . moreover , cloutis et al .",
    "( 1990 ) found that the spectra of three iron meteorites reddened with increasing grain size .",
    "+ thus , the correlation of the continuum slope to the semimajor axis together with the anti correlation of near - infrared slope to albedo are not easily interpreted .",
    "they may reflect a different surface composition of different m - type asteroids , and/or a combination of surface composition , grain size and space weathering effects that are not yet fully understood .",
    "there are 30 asteroids having m - type visible wavelength and albedo properties that were investigated in this study .",
    "one was removed due to its similarity to an s - type asteroid ( 516 amherstia ) . of the remaining 29 asteroids ,",
    "16 have detectable faint absorption features .",
    "the shape and slopes in the continuum , visible , and near infrared varies greatly when tholen m - class objects have their spectral measurements extended .",
    "all were found to be classifiable in the extended wavelength taxonomy defined by demeo et al .",
    "our search for meteorite analogs concluded that the shape of the spectra could be modeled by a variety of iron and stony iron meteorites , as well as pallasites , enstatite chondrites , and irradiated mixtures .",
    "however , this method of search de - emphasizes the small absorption features . to investigate the significance of the shallow absorption features found in our sample , we used a linear ( geographical ) spectral mixing model .",
    "one possible avenue for investigation is the mixture of the totally featureless , red - sloped metallic meteorites with orthopyroxenes , which are thought to create the weak 0.9 @xmath0 m feature .",
    "to constrain the surface composition of our sampled asteroids and the abundance of silicate material needed to reproduce the weak 0.9 @xmath0 m band seen on some spectra , we created spatially segregated ( geographical ) mixtures of several terrestrial and meteoritic materials in different grain sizes .",
    "we considered endmembers from among all the samples included in the us geological digital spectral library @xmath36 ) and in the relab database .",
    "the synthetic spectra that we created were compared with the asteroid spectra using the known iras albedo and the v+nir spectral behavior and slope as constraints . a few percent ( less than 2% ) of orthopyroxenes or hydrated silicates ( goethite ) added to iron meteorites allowed us to reproduce the weak spectral feature around 0.9 @xmath0 m .",
    "unfortunately , the synthetic spectra did not match both albedo , spectral slope , and band depth and center of the observed asteroids .",
    "moreover , synthetic spectra do not give unique results , as we can obtain similar spectra by adding more components or changing the grain size properties of minerals .",

    "the spectral behaviour of both mixtures does not completely match all the spectral characteristics of 22 kalliope .",
    "figure  [ mixture ] emphasizes our results that a ) it is not easy to fully reproduce the 0.9 @xmath0 m band , asteroid albedo and spectral slope simply enriching an iron meteorite with some silicates , b ) the 0.9 @xmath0 m band could be reproduced both with a small amount of anhydrous silicates such as orthopyroxene , but also with some hydrated silicates like goethite .",
    "this last possibility can not be completely ruled out .",
    "it would support the hypothesis of the presence of hydrated materials on some m - type asteroids , as inferred by rivkin et al .",

    "( 1990 ) identified the 0.9 @xmath0 m feature in the spectra of some enstatite chondrites .",

    "( 1982 ) have shown that the physical state of the surface plays an important role in the relative contribution of metal to the spectrum of a silicate - metal mixture .",
    "if the surface is spotty with separate areas of pure silicate and pure metal , the spectrum differs very little from that of pure silicate , even in the case of 50% metal content .",
    "but if metal and pyroxene particles were mixed , the presence of 50% metal almost completely suppresses the pyroxene bands and the spectrum appears to be indistinguishable from that of the pure metal .",
    "thus , our spectra could have a fairly high concentration of silicate materials , as long as the surface composition is well - mixed .",
    "the results of our search for meteorite analogs confirm that these objects originally in the tholen m - class could be the parent bodies both of iron ( or stony - iron ) meteorites and enstatite chondrites .",

    "<S> m - type asteroids , as defined in the tholen taxonomy ( tholen , 1984 ) , are medium albedo bodies supposed to have a metallic composition and to be the progenitors both of differentiated iron - nickel meteorites and enstatite chondrites . </S>",
    "<S> we carried out a spectroscopic survey in the visible and near infrared wavelength range ( 0.4 - 2.5 @xmath0 m ) of 30 asteroids chosen from the population of asteroids initially classified as tholen m - types , aiming to investigate their surface composition . </S>",
    "<S> the data were obtained during several observing runs during the years 2004 - 2007 at the tng , ntt , and irtf telescopes . </S>",
    "<S> we computed the spectral slopes in several wavelength ranges for each observed asteroid , and we searched for diagnostic spectral features . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm a large variety of spectral behaviors for these objects as their spectra are extended into the near - infrared , including the identification of weak absorption bands , mainly of the 0.9 @xmath0 m band tentatively attributed to orthopyroxene , and of the 0.43 @xmath0 m band that may be associated to chlorites and mg - rich serpentines or pyroxene minerals such us pigeonite or augite . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison with previously published data indicates that the surfaces of several asteroids belonging to the m - class may vary significantly . </S>",
    "<S> + we attempt to constrain the asteroid surface compositions of our sample by looking for meteorite spectral analogues in the relab database and by modelling with geographical mixtures of selected meteorites / minerals . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm that iron meteorites , pallasites , and enstatite chondrites are the best matches to most objects in our sample , as suggested for m - type asteroids . for 22 kalliope </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrate that a syntetic mixture obtained enriching a pallasite meteorite with small amounts ( 1 - 2% ) of silicates well reproduce the spectral behaviour including the observed 0.9 @xmath0 m feature .    </S>",
    "<S> the presence of subtle absorption features on several asteroids confirms that not all objects defined by the tholen m - class have a pure metallic composition .    </S>",
    "<S> a statistical analysis of spectral slope distribution versus orbital parameters shows that our sample originally defined as tholen m - types tend to be dark in albedo and red in slope for increasing value of the semi - major axis . </S>",
    "<S> however , we note that our sample is statistically limited by our number of objects ( 30 ) and slightly varying results are found for different subsets . if confirmed , the albedo and slope trends could be due to a difference in composition of objects belonging to the outer main belt , or alternatively to a combination of surface composition , grain size and space weathering effects .    </S>",
