    "in previous papers ( kato 2004 , 2008 ) , we showed that in a _ deformed _ relativistic keplerian disk , inertial - acoustic oscillations ( and g - mode oscillations ) are resonantly excited .",
    "the deformation required for the excitation is a warp or a one - armed plane - symmetric spiral pattern .",
    "the inertial - acoustic oscillations resonantly excited in the above deformed disks well describe the 3:2 twin high - frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( hf qpos ) observed in black hole x - ray binaries , if the disk region where the oscillations are excited is surrounded by a hot corona ( torus ) ( kato and fukue 2006 ) . in khz qpos in neutron - star x - ray binaries , the frequencies of the twin qpos change with time with correlation .",
    "these correlated time change of twin khz qpos can be accounted for , if the deformation has a time - dependent precession ( e.g. , kato 2007 ) .",
    "any successful models of qpos of neutron - star x - ray binaries , however , should account for the observed frequency correlations not only between twin khz qpos but also those among khz qpos and low - frequency qpos ( lf qpos ) ( psaltis et al .",
    "1999 ; boutloukos et al .",
    "2006 ) .    concerning disk oscillation modes that are excited in one - armed deformed disks , we find by a careful inspection of mathematical stability analyses by kato ( 2008 ) that the one - armed c - mode oscillations are also resonantly excited in addition of inertial - acoustic oscillations ( and g - mode oscillations ) ( see subsection 4.2 ) .",
    "this is of interest in relation to observations , since the one - armed c - mode oscillations have low frequencies and thus they are one of possible candidates of low - frequency qpos ( lf qpos ) .",
    "disk oscillations that are excited in one - armed deformed disk are thus inertial - acoustic oscillations ( and g - mode oscillation ) and c - mode oscillations .    in this paper , we examine frequency - frequency correlations among the disk oscillations that are resonantly excited , in order to compare them with observed correlations of qpos . the oscillation modes considered here are three oscillation modes , i.e. , two basic inertial - acoustic oscillations among excited inertial - acoustic ones and the one - armed c - mode oscillation . comparisons with observations are made to cir x-1 , since frequencies of twin khz qpos and lf qpos to this source are carefully examined recently ( boutloukos et al .",
    "we present here the essential part of the model ( kato 2004 , 2008 ) , although the model has various variations .",
    "the disk we consider is a geometrically thin , relativistic disk .",
    "the disks are assumed to be deformed from an axially - symmetric steady state by some external or internal cause .",
    "the deformation is taken to be eccentric in the disk plane , i.e. , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the azimuthal wavenumber of the deformation . concerning the symmetry of the deformation with respect to the equatorial plane ,",
    "two cases are considered .",
    "one is the case where the deformation has no vertical asymmetry , i.e. , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is zero or a positive integer specifying the number of node(s ) in the vertical direction .",
    "the other is the case where the deformation is asymmetric with respect to the equator , i.e. , @xmath8 .",
    "the latter deformation ( i.e. , @xmath4 and @xmath8 ) is a kind of tilt or warp .",
    "the deformation is assumed to have a time - dependent precession , i.e. , it rotates in the azimuthal direction with time - dependent angular velocity .",
    "the angular velocity of the precession is denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath9 is positive the precession is prograde , while it is retrograde when @xmath10 . in the case of neutron star , unlike the case of black hole , it has a surface , and the disk surrounding the star has strong radiative and magnetic couplings with the star .",
    "we assume that this is one of possible causes of time - dependent precession of disks .",
    "for example , pringle ( 1992 , 1996 ) and maloney et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have shown that radiative force from the central star can lead to corrugation of the disk .",
    "even initially planar disks are unstable to warping ( pringle 1996 ) .",
    "movies made by pringle and his collaborators show that the disk precession is time - dependent and it can drastically change even the direction of the precession .",
    "we consider oscillations on the disks described above .",
    "disk oscillations are generally described by ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the angular velocity and azimuthal wavenumber ( @xmath14 ) of the oscillations , respectively , and @xmath13 is an integer ( @xmath15 ) describing the number of node(s ) of the oscillations in the vertical direction ( see kato et al 2008 for detailed classification of disk oscillations ) . for a set of ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) ,",
    "there are two different kinds of modes of oscillations , except for the case of @xmath16 . in the case of @xmath16",
    ", we have inertial - acoustic oscillations ( p - mode ) alone , which consist of nearly horizontal motions ( motions in the disk plane ) . in the case of @xmath17",
    ", we have two different modes of oscillations .",
    "one is gravity oscillations ( g - mode ) .",
    "the other is corrugation waves ( c - mode ) ( @xmath18 ) or vertical - acoustic oscillations ( vertical p - mode)(@xmath19 ) .",
    "the oscillation modes that are treated in this paper are the inertial - acoustic mode ( @xmath16 ) [ and the g - mode ( @xmath17 ) ] and the c - mode oscillations ( @xmath18 ) with @xmath20 .      a nonlinear coupling between the disk deformation characterized by ( @xmath9 , @xmath5 , @xmath7 ) and an oscillation with ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) brings about oscillations described by ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) , where various combinations of @xmath24 are possible .",
    "these oscillations are hereafter called intermediate oscillations .",
    "these intermediate oscillations have resonant interaction with the disk at particular radii where the dispersion relation of the intermediate oscillations is satisfied .",
    "there are two kinds of resonance for the same set of ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) . in one of them",
    ", resonance occurs through horizontal motions , while it occurs through vertical motions in the other one .",
    "we call the former resonance a horizontal resonance , while the latter resonance a vertical resonance ( kato 2004 , 2008 ) .    after making the resonant interaction with the disk , the intermediate oscillations nonlinearly couple with the deformed part of the disks to feedback to the original oscillation of ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) ( see figure 1 of kato 2004 ) .",
    "this nonlinear feedback processes amplify or dampen the original oscillations , depending on the types of oscillations and of resonance .",
    "careful stability analyses have been done by kato ( 2008 ) ( see also kato 2004 ) in the case where the deformation has no precession , i.e. , @xmath25 .",
    "here , we outline how the results derived by kato ( 2008 ) to the case of @xmath25 are generalized to the case of @xmath26 .      as mentioned in the previous section , there are two kinds of resonance , i.e. , horizontal and vertical resonances .",
    "hereafter , we restrict our attention only to the horizontal resonance , since in the case of no precession , the resonance that can excite disk oscillations is the horizontal resonance alone ( kato 2004 , 2008 ) . in the case of @xmath25 ,",
    "the condition of the horizontal resonance is @xmath27 ^ 2-\\kappa^2=0 $ ] ( kato 2004 , 2008 ) , where @xmath28 is the angular velocity of disk rotation and taken to be the relativistic keplerian one , @xmath29 , when its numerical figure is required , since we consider geometrically thin disks .",
    "the symbol @xmath30 is the epicyclic frequency .",
    "if the deformation has a precession , the condition for horizontal resonance is generalized to @xmath31 ^ 2-\\kappa^2=0 , \\label{2.1}\\ ] ] where arbitrary combination of @xmath24 is allowed .",
    "equation ( [ 2.1 ] ) gives resonant radii as functions of @xmath11 for a given set of @xmath9 and @xmath12 ( see figures 1 and 2 ) .",
    "to find whether the resonance excites or dampens the oscillations , we must examine ( i ) the sign of work done on the oscillations at the resonant radii and ( ii ) the sign of the wave energy of the oscillations ( kato 2008 , see also kato 2004 ) .",
    "for example , if a positive work is done at a resonant radius on an oscillation of a positive energy , the oscillation is amplified .",
    "analyses made by kato ( 2004 , 2008 ) show that the sign of the work done by resonance on oscillations at a resonant radius is governed by the sign of @xmath32 at the resonant radius , when the deformation has no precession .",
    "let us denote resonant radii given by equation ( [ 2.1 ] ) by @xmath33 and the work done on oscillations by the resonance at @xmath33 by @xmath34 .",
    "then , in the case where the deformation has a precession with angular frequency @xmath9 , we have @xmath35 _               { \\rm resonance } , \\label{2.2}\\ ] ] where sign(@xmath36 ) represents the sign of @xmath36 , and",
    "the subscript resonance denotes the value at @xmath33 .",
    "the wave energy , @xmath37 , of oscillations depends on whether the main part of oscillations exist inside or outside the corotation radius defined by @xmath38 .",
    "if it exists inside the corotation radius , the wave energy is negative . in the case",
    "where @xmath39 , the oscillations are excited by resonance , if the work done on the oscillations by resonance is positive @xmath40 . in the case of @xmath41",
    ", on the other hand , @xmath42 excites the oscillations .      for oscillations to be excited efficiently , the resonant radius must be in the propagation region of the oscillations . in the case of inertial - acoustic oscillations with @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the propagation region",
    "is described by @xmath43 while it is @xmath44 in the case of g - mode oscillations .",
    "in addition to the inertial - acoustic oscillations and g - mode oscillations , we consider in this paper the c - mode oscillations ( @xmath18 ) with @xmath20 .",
    "their propagation region is described by ( e.g. , kato 2001 , kato et al .",
    "1998 , 2008 ) @xmath45 when local approximations are adopted , where @xmath46 is the vertical epicyclic frequency ( kato 1990 ) and slightly smaller than @xmath47 ) .",
    "descriptions in the previous section give us necessary materials for specifying the oscillation modes that are really excited by resonance .",
    "we now examine this issue by using the so - called propagation diagram of oscillations .",
    "if an arbitrarily large precession is allowed , various oscillations can be excited . in order to simplify situations by excluding less realistic cases ,",
    "we restrict our attention here only to the oscillations that can be excited even in the limit of no precession , and study how the frequencies of such resonantly - excited oscillations are affected by the presence of precession of deformation .",
    "that is , we restrict our attention only to horizontal resonance .",
    "cases of inertial - acoustic oscillations ( and g - mode oscillations ) and c - mode oscillations are considered separately below , since the resonant radii are different in these cases .",
    "examination of excitation conditions of inertial - acoustic oscillations on the propagation diagram has been made in a previous paper ( kato 2008 ) in the case of no precession ( see figures 1 and 2 of kato 2008 ) . here",
    "we extend it to cases where the deformation has precession .",

    "thick ( both solid and dotted ) curves give the frequency - radius relation for resonant excitation of one - armed ( @xmath20 ) inertial - acoustic oscillations [ see equation ( [ 2.1 ] ) and examine the signs of @xmath34 and @xmath37 ] .",
    "the dotted parts of the thick curves are , however , inside the evanescent region of the oscillations [ see equation ( [ 2.3 ] ) ] , and thus excitation on the part will be practically inefficient .",

    "two cases of @xmath25 and @xmath54 hz are shown .",
    "the thin dotted curves are the frequency - radius relation of resonance that leads the oscillations to damping .    as shown in figure 1 , one - armed oscillations that are excited are not unique . in a finite range of radius ,",
    "oscillations are excited with different frequencies [ see the sentence just below equation ( [ 2.1 ] ) ] .",
    "furthermore , two oscillations can be excited at the same radius .",
    "one has higher frequencies than @xmath28 at the resonant radius , while the other is smaller than @xmath28 .    here",
    ", we assume that the oscillations whose group velocity is slower will be excited till a larger amplitude than those with a faster group velocity , since they stay a place for a longer time and the resonance condition is maintained for a longer time .",
    "if we adopt local approximations , the group velocity of oscillations vanishes at the boundary between the propagation region and the evanescent region , which is specified by @xmath51 or @xmath52 in the case of one - armed oscillations . if this consideration is adopted , the most predominantly excited oscillations are those with @xmath51 in the case of the higher frequency oscillations and those with @xmath52 in the case of the lower frequency oscillations . then , combining this condition and the resonant condition given by equation ( [ 2.1 ] ) , we have , as the condition determining the resonant radius , @xmath55 if the deformation has no precession , @xmath25 , this condition gives @xmath56 and the resonance occurs at @xmath57 when the central source has no spin , where @xmath58 is the schwarzschild radius given by @xmath59 . among a series of resonant radii given by equation ( [ 2.1 ] ) , the resonant radius given by equation ( [ 4.1 ] )",

    "[ in the case of corrugation waves , the resonant radius is different from @xmath60 .",

    "although two cases of @xmath25 and @xmath54 hz are shown in figure 4 , the difference of two curves of @xmath76 in two cases of @xmath25 and @xmath54 hz is little , when the curves are in the propagation region of the oscillations . in the right - lower corner of figure 4 , the curve of @xmath76 crosses again the curve of @xmath73 when @xmath10 , and the curve of @xmath76 enters into the propagation region of the corrugation waves for large value of @xmath78 . in order to show this , an enlargement of the right - lower corner of figure 4",
    "is shown in figure 5 .    as in the case of inertial - acoustic oscillations ,",
    "the group velocity of the c - mode oscillations vanishes at the boundary of the propagation and evanescent regions .",
    "hence , we consider that the c - mode oscillations predominantly excited by the resonance are those that satisfy simultaneously @xmath73 and @xmath76 . combination of these two equations gives @xmath79 this is the resonant condition for the most predominantly excited c - mode oscillations . the resonant radius determined by this condition",
    "is denoted by @xmath80 .",

    "the radius - precession relation specified by equation ( [ 4.6 ] ) is shown in figure 3 in the case of @xmath70 and 0.3 with @xmath72 .",
    "arguments in subsection 4.1 show that the inertial - acoustic oscillations that are dominantly excited on the deformed disks are those whose frequencies are specified by @xmath61 , @xmath67 , and @xmath62 [ see equations ( [ 4.2 ] ) and ( [ 4.3 ] ) ] .",
    "( oscillations with @xmath68 are not considered here , since their frequency is rather high and will be outside of observations . ) among these three oscillations , the oscillation of @xmath62 will be less important in observational view points .",
    "this is because the propagation region of the oscillation is outside the resonant radius @xmath60 and extended infinitely .",
    "this suggests that the oscillation will not remain for a long time around the resonant radius , since it propagates away outside . on the other hand ,",
    "the propagation regions of waves with @xmath61 and @xmath67 are inside the resonant radius .",
    "the waves are , thus , partially trapped between the resonant radius , @xmath60 , and the inner edge of the disk , and remain in that region for a long time , different from the wave with @xmath62 .",
    "next , we should emphasize here that one - armed oscillations with @xmath61 are not always observed only with their own frequency @xmath61 .",
    "they may be observed with the two - fold frequency when the disk region where the oscillations are excited is surrounded by a hot corona and when we observe high energy photons that are reprocessed in the corona ( see figures 2  4 by kato and fukue 2006 ) .",
    "based on these two considerations , we think that the frequencies related to the twin hf qpos observed in black - hole and neutron - star binaries are @xmath83 and @xmath67 .",
    "the corrugation waves that are excited are also one - armed , and thus by the same reason mentioned above they will be observed with the twofold frequency , @xmath84 .",
    "it is further noted that they are trapped inside the resonant radius , @xmath80 .    in summary , we take the picture that the main frequencies to be observed are @xmath85 in the order of increase of frequency . as discussed below , @xmath84 will correspond to the low - frequency qpo ( lf qpo ) , and @xmath83 and @xmath67 correspond to the lower and upper khz qpos , respectively .",
    "if the deformation has no precession , the frequency ratio of @xmath83 to @xmath86 is just 2 to 3 , independent of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",

    "requirement of such a high value of @xmath3 is compatible with what required in the previous paragraph to describe the lf qpo  lower khz qpo correlation .",
    "we have applied a resonantly - excited disk - oscillation model to cir x-1 in section 5 .",
    "a comparison of observational data with the model suggests that the spin of the central source of cir x-1 is rather high , i.e. , @xmath94 .",

    "such a high spin , as well as a high eccentric orbit of cir x-1 , may suggest that the system is young .",
    "comparison of observations and the model suggests that the disk of cir x-1 has a retrograde precession and it varies in the range of 100 hz @xmath107 200 hz ( see figures 6 and 7 ) . for khz qpos to be excited by retrograde precession , the absolute value of the precession must be less than a few hundred hz ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "otherwise , inertial - acoustic oscillations can not have resonant interaction with disk deformation , i.e. , we have no khz qpos .",
    "that is , the range of variation of qpo frequencies is related to the magnitude of precession and the range of its variation .    here",
    ", we more closely discuss the relations among precession , resonant radius , and frequency of resonant oscillations .",
    "if precession is retrograde and its absolute value is smaller than a critical value , resonance occurs at two different radii for each of inertial - acoustic and corrugation waves ( see figure 3 ) . for each case of inertial - acoustic and corrugation waves , we call the resonance at the outer radius an outer resonance , and the resonance at the inner radius an inner resonance ( see section 5 ) . in the case of cir x-1 ,",
    "as shown in section 5 , the resonance that can describe observations is the outer one ( see also that the gradients of three curves of @xmath108 , @xmath67 , and @xmath84 are all positive in figures 6 and 7 ) . in cir x-1 ,",
    "the frequencies of oscillations resonantly excited at the inner resonance are higher than those observed , as long as conventional mass of neutron stars are adopted . the fact that oscillations at the inner resonance are not observed in cir",
    "x-1 suggests that the inner disk region of cir x-1 is highly disturbed .",
    "one of possible causes of such disturbances will be strong couplings of the inner disk region with the surface of the central source through strong magnetic fields and high spin of the central source .",
    "the cases where the observed twin khz qpos are the oscillations excited at the outer resonance will be rare , compared with the cases where they are those excited at the inner resonance , since the twin qpos in many sources have higher frequencies than those in cir x-1 .",
    "that is , in the sources where the high - frequency twin qpos have really frequencies close to or higher than one khz , they will be resonant oscillations at the inner resonance and the precession will be small or prograde .",
    "it is noted that in the case where the precession is slow or prograde , the outer resonance will be observationally less interesting , since the frequencies excited there are too low or the outer resonance itself is absent ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "let us briefly demonstrate an example in which qpos occur at the inner resonance .",
    "sco x-1 has twin khz qpos in the 800  1100 khz range , a @xmath10745 hz horizontal - branch oscillation ( hbo ) , and a @xmath107 6 hz normal - branch oscillation ( nbo ) . here",
    ", we examine the possibility that the observed twin khz qpos correspond to @xmath83 and @xmath67 , and the 45 hz oscillation to @xmath84 , as in the case of cir x-1 .",
    "the observed frequencies and their changes of the lower and upper khz qpos can be roughly described by assuming that the precession of the disk deformation is prograde and @xmath109 , when @xmath3 is taken to be zero ( see figure 3 of kato 2007 ) . if @xmath3 is zero , however , there is no corrugation wave ( @xmath110 ) and we can not account for a @xmath107 45 hz oscillation by our present model .",
    "as mentioned in section 5 , the frequency correlation between @xmath83 and @xmath67 is little affected by changing the value of @xmath3 , while the frequency of @xmath84 is strongly affected by @xmath3 .",
    "hence , by adjusting the value of @xmath3 we can describe a 45 hz qpo by @xmath84 .",
    "our preliminary results show that both frequencies of twin khz qpos and of hbo can be accounted for by our model with @xmath111 is rather high compared with the conventional one adopted as the mass of neutron stars , but will be still in the range allowed theoretically and observationally .",
    "] and @xmath112 , the precession being nearly zero or weakly prograde . a @xmath107 6hz normal - branch oscillation ( nbo ) might be a manifestation of the slowly precessing disk deformation required in our model .",
    "it is noted here that we have adopted @xmath84 ( not @xmath81 ) and @xmath83 ( not @xmath61 ) as frequencies of lf qpo and the lower khz qpo , respectively .",
    "this is , however , not always the case in all sources , unless the disks are surrounded by coronae .",
    "hence , some caution will be necessary when we make comparison of the model with observations .",
    "for example , the frequency of lf qpo may be @xmath81 in some objects .",
    "hereafter , we mention the basic assumptions involved in the model , and discuss validity of these assumptions .",
    "first , we have assumed that ( i ) the disk is deformed in an eccentric form ( @xmath4 ) in the state when the qpos are observed .",
    "there seems no clear observational evidence for or against this assumption .",
    "there are , however , numerical simulations that support a relation between disk deformation and appearance of qpos .",
    "magnetohydrodynamical simulations of accretion flows by machida and matsumoto ( 2008 ) show a formation of a torus in the central region of disks and its quasi - periodic deformation into a one - armed form at a certain phase of the flows .",
    "they show that this deformation gives rise to a low - frequency quasi - periodic variation of mass accretion rate , and further that in this deformed state , high - frequency qpos of the order of one hundred hz appear ( the mass is taken to be 10 @xmath113 ) .",
    "it is not clear , however , whether such disk deformations are related to the disk deformation required in the present disk - oscillation model .",
    "the second requirement involved in the present model is that ( ii ) the deformation must have a time - dependent precession .",
    "this time - dependent precession is necessary to bring about a change of resonant radius and thus to account for the frequency change of qpos .",
    "it is uncertain whether such precession really exists in neutron - star binary sources . by couplings through magnetic and radiation fields , the accretion disks surrounding a neutron star will have strong interaction with the surface of the star",
    "this may be one of possible causes of time - dependent precession of deformed disks ( see subsection 2.1 ) .",
    "the papaloizou  pringle instability in a torus , however , will not be at least the cause of the disk precession in cir x-1 , since the precession required to describe the observations is retrograde .",
    "the hectohertz qpos might be a manifestation of the precession , but if so , it is not clear why they are not always observed in the phases where qpos appear .",
    "third , it is assumed that ( iii ) one - armed ( @xmath20 ) disk oscillations excited on disks are observed with the two - fold frequency .",
    "that is , we assume that the resonant region of the geometrically thin disks where qpos are excited is surrounded by a hot corona ( a torus ) and the observed qpo photons are those reprocessed in the corona to higher energy . if such a picture is taken , we can expect the two - fold frequency in the case of one - armed oscillations ( see figures 2  4 by kato and fukue 2006 ) . at the phase when the qpos are observed in black hole sources ( i.e. , the very high state ) ,",
    "the spectra really show coexistence of a disk component and a corona ( a torus ) .",
    "it is uncertain , however , that such corona ( torus ) exists even in the case of neutron - star x - ray sources , since in the case of neutron stars , a hot corona will be weakened by presence of abundant soft photons from the surface of the star .",
    "fourth , an important assumption involved in our model is that ( iv ) dominantly excited oscillations are those with zero group velocity .",
    "this is an approximate procedure .",
    "in the future , it will be necessary to solve global disk oscillations with relevant boundary conditions in order to clarify whether this approximate procedure is allowed as the first approximation .",
    "another important issue to be reminded here is whether the outward propagation oscillations , characterized by @xmath62 and @xmath68 , can be really regarded as less important , compared with the oscillations characterized by @xmath61 and @xmath67 . unlike the epicyclic resonant model by abramowicz and klu ' zniak ( 2001 ) and klu ' zniak and abramowicz ( 2001 ) , in the present disk - oscillation model , the appearance of the twin qpos is not a result of mutual interaction of twin oscillations . in the present model , twin oscillations",
    "are independently excited by interaction with the disk deformation . in this reason , there is no direct amplitude relation between the twin oscillations in the present model .",
    "trk ( 2008 ) found a frequency  amplitude relation of the observed twin qpos .",
    "such correlations can not be accounted for in this model , unless nonlinear evolutions of the excited oscillations are considered .",
    "finally , we should notice a close relation between our present model and the relativistic precession model by stella and vietri ( 1999 ) .",
    "in the latter model , the upper and lower khz qpos are interpreted , respectively , as a frequency of disk rotation , @xmath28 , and periastron precession frequency , @xmath114 , at a certain radius , which is a free parameter . in the present disk - oscillation model ,",
    "the frequency of the upper khz qpo is @xmath115 ( which is close to @xmath28 ) , and that of the lower one is @xmath116 . in the present mode",
    ", the radius specifying these frequencies is the radius of resonance , @xmath60 , which is determined by coupling between the oscillations and the disk deformation .",
    "further , in the model by stella and vietri ( 1999 ) , the frequency of low - frequency qpo is the nodal precession frequency , @xmath117 , at a radius , which is again a free parameter . in our model",
    "the frequency of low - frequency qpo ( lf qpo ) is the frequency of corrugation waves , which is @xmath118 , but the radius specifying the value of @xmath118 is the resonant radius given by @xmath80 .",
    "the author thanks the referee for invaluable comments on comparison of the model with observations .",
    "the author also thanks m. abramowicz , w. kluniak , r. matsumoto , s. mineshige , m. bursa , j. horak , m. machida , g. tr \" ok , for helpfu discussions during the yitp workshop yitp - w-07 - 14 on `` quasi - periodic oscillations and time variabilities of accretion flows '' .",
    "this workshop was financially supported by the yukawa institute of theoretical physics at kyoto university ."
