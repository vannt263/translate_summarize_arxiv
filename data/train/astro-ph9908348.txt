    "efforts to improve the sensitivity of redshift - independent distance estimators as peculiar velocity probes exploit correlations in the physical properties of the objects used .",
    "one such correlation , between absolute magnitude , @xmath7 and hoessel s ( 1980 ) ` structure parameter ' , @xmath8 ( @xmath9\\right|_{r_{m}}$ ] ; logarithmic slope of the luminosity profile at a metric aperture , @xmath10 ) was employed by lauer & postman ( 1994 , hereafter lp ) for a sample of optically selected brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) in 119 aco ( abell , corwin & olowin 1989 ) hosts , to reduce the scatter in bcg @xmath7 from 0.33 to 0.24 mag .",
    "subsequent analysis suggested a large - scale coherent bulk flow  a result in conflict with current cosmological models ( e.g. strauss & willick 1995 ) .",
    "hudson & ebeling ( 1997 ) speculated that this scatter may be further reduced via corrections for bcg environment .",
    "we explore this possibility with an independent , x - ray selected data set .",
    "x - ray selection has significant advantages over optical selection : ( @xmath11 ) diffuse x - ray emission from cluster cores identifies bona - fide clusters and reduces superposition effects , which in optical catalogues , can overestimate cluster richness .",
    "( @xmath12 ) x - ray parameters provide a more physical reflection of the nature of cluster environments .",
    "( @xmath13 ) x - ray surveys are background limited and thus free from problems in estimating local background galaxy number density .",
    "additionally , surveying the _ whole sky _ using a single detector avoids biases present in optical catalogues , assembled from disparate survey characteristics ( e.g. aco ) .",
    "we search for diffuse emission above an x - ray flux limit of @xmath14 erg s@xmath1 @xmath2 in the latest reduction of the _ rosat _ all - sky survey ( rass ii ) .",
    "the resulting database is paired with coordinates for aco clusters with published redshifts , @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath16 clusters for which the aco coordinate lies within @xmath17 arc - minutes of the x - ray centroid form a parent sample .",
    "composite images frequently show coincidences between peaks of x - ray emission and projected position of dominant galaxies ( lazzati & chincarini 1998 ) .",
    "bcg candidates for our sample are identified via this positional coincidence . in over 90% of cases ,",
    "positional coincidences are unambiguous . when no candidate is found close to a local x - ray centroid , the dominant elliptical closest to the global cluster x - ray centroid is adopted as the bcg candidate .    for @xmath18 clusters , for which photometric zero point accuracy @xmath19 mag .",
    ", we measure structure parameter , @xmath8 at 10 @xmath20 kpc and @xmath5-band absolute metric aperture magnitude , @xmath7 within elliptical apertures of this semi - major axis ( excluding contaminating sources ) of all ellipticals within x - ray peaks .",
    "figure [ fig2.comphist ] compares @xmath8 distributions for the lp sample and a subset of the x - ray sample ( for which positional coincidences are unambiguous ) . ( a ) the mean value of the x - ray distribution ( @xmath21 ) is higher than the lp sample ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "( b ) the lp data show excess low-@xmath8 ( @xmath23 ) galaxies .",
    "conversely , the x - ray selected sample shows an excess contribution from high-@xmath8 ( @xmath24 ) galaxies .",
    "the distribution of x - ray selected bcg candidates appears shifted to high-@xmath8 values .",
    "( c ) despite larger sample size , the x - ray selected distribution occupies a narrower range of @xmath8 than the lp case .",
    "( d ) the x - ray sample histogram is more gaussian than the lp sample .",
    "comparing identifications in 49 clusters common to both samples , we find @xmath25 of these hosts have different bcg candidates , depending upon selection method . in every common cluster in which lp find a low-@xmath8 ( @xmath26 ) bcg , our objective technique selects a different candidate , always with higher @xmath8 than the optically selected bcg .",
    "thus , x - ray selection reduces contaminating effects evident in optical samples , preferentially selecting high-@xmath8 bcg candidates and producing a more homogeneous sample .",
    "figure [ fig3.magalpha ] does not show any @xmath7-@xmath8 correlation ( c.f .",
    "4 ) . appealing to a speculated correction for environment ( hudson & ebeling 1997 ) , we consider 152 clusters with reliably determined x - ray luminosities , @xmath27 .",
    "the response of @xmath7 to @xmath27 ( figure [ fig4.triframe ] ) does not indicate a correlation in any interval of @xmath8 .",
    "hence , despite the homogeneity of x - ray selected samples , these candidates remain relatively poor standard candles .",
    "the scatter remains @xmath28 mag .",
    "dominating any dipole signal that may be present as the result of a coherent bulk streaming motion .",
    "the @xmath7-@xmath8 correlation in optical bcg samples ( hoessel 1980 , lp ) is principally constrained at low-@xmath8 . above @xmath29 ,",
    "scatter about the mean relation increases and no correlation is evident .",
    "x - ray selection preferentially samples this high-@xmath8 regime .",
    "therefore @xmath7-@xmath8 correlations result from galaxies not coincident with x - ray centroids .",
    "such galaxies are less likely to reflect the dynamics of the underlying cluster potential than x - ray centroid coincident bcg(s ) in the same host .",
    "the existence of @xmath7-@xmath8 correlations may signal biases in selection procedure via inclusion of poor tracers of cluster peculiar velocity .",
    "since homogeneous samples of x - ray coincident sources fail to improve bcg reliability as standard candles , perhaps their usefulness in cosmic flow studies has been overstated .",
