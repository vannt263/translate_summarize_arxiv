    "high redshift galaxy populations are now being detected back to 780 million years after the big bang ( spectroscopically confirmed:@xmath0=6.96 ; iye  @xcite ) , probing into the epoch of cosmic reionization ( e.g. , fan  @xcite ; hu & cowie @xcite ) .",
    "many of these very distant galaxies show evidence for star formation activity ( e.g. , taniguchi  @xcite ) . some are even found to be hyperluminous infrared galaxies ( hlirgs ; bertoldi  @xcite ; wang  @xcite ) with far - infrared ( fir ) luminosities exceeding 10@xmath15 , suggesting vigorous star formation and/or agn activity . to probe the earliest stages of galaxy formation and the importance of agn in this process ,",
    "it is necessary to study the star formation characteristics of these galaxies .    a good diagnostic to examine the star - forming environments in distant hlirgs are observations of molecular gas , the fuel for star formation .",
    "the by far brightest and most common indicator of molecular gas in galaxies is line emission from the rotational transitions of carbon monoxide ( co ) , which was detected in @xmath1640 galaxies at high redshift ( @xmath0@xmath91 ; see solomon & vanden bout @xcite for a review ) .",
    "these observations have revealed molecular gas reservoirs with masses of @xmath910@xmath17  in these galaxies , even in the highest redshift quasar known , j1148 + 5251 at @xmath0=6.42 ( walter @xcite , @xcite ; bertoldi @xcite ) .",
    "although co is a good tracer of the total amount of molecular gas in a galaxy , due to the relatively low critical density of @xmath18@xmath2 required to collisionally excite its lower @xmath19 transitions , it is not a reliable tracer of the dense molecular cloud cores where the actual star formation takes place .",
    "recent studies of nearby actively star - forming galaxies have shown that hydrogen cyanide ( hcn ) is a far better tracer of the dense ( @xmath20@xmath2 ) molecular gas where stars actually form ( e.g.  gao & solomon @xcite , @xcite , hereafter :  gs04a , gs04b ) . in the local universe",
    "it was found that the hcn luminosity ( @xmath5 ) scales linearly ( unlike @xmath21 ) with the fir luminosity ( @xmath11 ) over 78 orders of magnitude , ranging from galactic dense cores to ulirgs ( wu et al.@xcite ) . as @xmath11 traces the massive star formation rate ( unless agn heating is significant ) , this implies that hcn is also a good tracer of star formation .",
    "hcn has now also been detected in five galaxies at @xmath0@xmath92 ( solomon  @xcite ; vanden bout  @xcite ; carilli  @xcite , hereafter :  c05 ; wagg @xcite ; gao  @xcite , hereafter :  g07 ) .",
    "adding a number of upper limits obtained for other high-@xmath0 galaxies , these observations indicate that the more luminous , higher redshift systems systematically deviate from the linear @xmath5@xmath22 correlation found in the local universe ( g07 ) , and hint at a rising slope of the relation toward high @xmath11 and/or @xmath0 . to further investigate this apparent non - linear ,",
    "rising trend , our aim has been to extend the range of existing hcn observations beyond redshift 6 and to higher @xmath11 .    in this letter , we report sensitive vla observations of  emission toward the @xmath0=6.42 quasar j1148 + 5251 , the highest redshift source detected in co. a previous , less sensitive search for  emission in this source has yielded no detection ( c05 ) .",
    "we use a concordance , flat @xmath23cdm cosmology throughout , with @xmath24=71mpc@xmath25 , @xmath26=0.27 , and @xmath27=0.73 ( spergel  @xcite ) .",
    "we observed the  transition line ( @xmath28ghz ) toward j1148 + 5251 using the vla in d configuration in 10tracks on 2004 june 21 and 26 ( these observations were discussed by c05 ) , and between 2007 may 01 and 13 . at the target redshift of 6.419 , the line is shifted to 23.892873ghz ( 11.96 mm ) .",
    "the total integration time amounts to 80hr .",
    "observations were performed in fast - switching mode using the nearby source 11534 + 49311 ( at @xmath29 distance to j1148 + 5251 ) for secondary amplitude and phase calibration .",
    "observations were carried out under very good weather conditions with 26 antennas [ including 9 expanded very large array ( evla ) antennas in 2007 ] :  the phase stability was excellent ( typically @xmath715@xmath30 phase rms for the longest baselines ) .",
    "the qso 3c286 was observed as a primary flux calibrator .",
    "the resulting flux scale is accurate within the standard 15% uncertainty .    in 2004 , two 25mhz wide intermediate frequency bands ( ifs ) with seven 3.125mhz channels each were observed simultaneously , one centered at the  line frequency ( 23.8929ghz ) , and one centered at 24.0430ghz for continuum monitoring .",
    "this leads to an effective bandwidth of 21.875mhz for both the line and continuum observations , corresponding to 274  at 23.9ghz . for lines as broad as co ( 279  fwhm ; bertoldi  @xcite )",

    "the fir luminosity is thought to originate dominantly from dust - reprocessed light of young massive stars , and thus to be a good tracer of the star - formation rate ( sfr ) in a galaxy .",

    "this trend appears to get stronger toward the even more fir - luminous @xmath0@xmath92 systems ( @xmath11/@xmath5=1525@xmath14 on average )",
    ". the lower limit of @xmath11/@xmath5@xmath96600 obtained for j1148 + 5251 is consistent with such a rising trend toward high-@xmath0 systems , and extends it toward higher redshift ( fig .",
    "[ f2]b ) . due to the fact that the high-@xmath0 sources also have systematically higher @xmath11 than the nearby galaxies",
    ", it remains unclear whether we observe a rising trend with redshift or with @xmath11 ( fig .",
    "[ f2]c ) , or both .",
    "krumholz & thompson ( @xcite ) argue that @xmath22/@xmath5 is expected to be higher for galaxies with a median ( molecular ) gas density @xmath51 close to or higher than the critical density @xmath52 required for excitation of the observed hcn transition than for galaxies with lower @xmath53 . in their case , they define star formation efficiency as the fraction of the mass that is converted into stars per dynamical time of the system . note that this is different than the star formation rate per unit total gas mass .",
    "they argue that the non - linear relation between @xmath11 and @xmath6 ( e.g. , kennicutt @xcite , @xcite ; gs04b ; riechers @xcite ) arises due to the fact that co traces all gas .",
    "the star - formation rate is then dictated by the density @xmath54 divided by the free - fall time @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) , giving the standard schmidt - law : star formation rate @xmath57 , or @xmath11 @xmath58@xmath59 . for molecules like hcn , which only trace the small fraction of dense gas clouds directly associated with star formation in normal galaxies , @xmath55 is roughly fixed by @xmath60 .",
    "hence the star formation rate shows a linear relationship with @xmath54 , or @xmath11 @xmath61@xmath62 .",
    "however , in extreme galaxies , where @xmath51 in the molecular ism approaches @xmath63 , @xmath55 again becomes relevant ( i.e. , hcn emission no longer selects just the rare , dense peaks whose density is fixed by @xmath52 , but instead traces the bulk of the ism , whose density can vary from galaxy to galaxy , and thus the variation of @xmath54 and @xmath55 re - enter the calculation ) , and the relationship approaches @xmath11 @xmath61@xmath59 ( and @xmath5 @xmath64 ) .",
    "interestingly , current data show a marginal trend for a changing power - law index at the highest luminosities of the type proposed by krumholz & thompson .",
    "this change in power - law index from 1 to 1.5 would suggest that , in these extreme luminosity systems , @xmath51 approaches @xmath65 .",
    "more systems at high luminosity are required to confirm this trend of changing power - law index .",
    "like most of the @xmath0@xmath92 hcn - detected sources , j1148 + 5251 is a quasar .",
    "it has been found that , even for such strong agn galaxies , the bulk of @xmath11 is likely dominatly heated by star formation in most cases ( e.g. , carilli  @xcite ; omont @xcite ; beelen  @xcite ; riechers @xcite ) .",
    "however , based on radiative transfer models of the dust sed of j1148 + 5251 , li  ( @xcite ) argue that this source may currently undergo a ` quasar phase ' , in which agn heating of the hot and warm dust contributes significantly to @xmath11 .",
    "if correct , this may be an alternative explanation for the elevated @xmath11/@xmath5 in this galaxy .",
    "the ( rest - frame ) ir properties ( tracing emission from hot dust ) of j1148 + 5251 are similar to those of other @xmath0@xmath96 quasars with much lower @xmath11 ( tracing emission from warm dust ) , and even to local quasars ( jiang  @xcite ) .",
    "this supports the assumption that the hot dust in j1148 + 5251 is dominantly heated by the agn ; however , the lack of a correlation between @xmath66 and @xmath11 in quasars indicates that the warm dust may still be dominantly heated by star formation .",
    "moreover , j1148 + 5251 follows the radio - fir correlation for star - forming galaxies ( carilli  @xcite ) , which also suggests a starburst origin for the dominant fraction of @xmath22 .",
    "furthermore , one of the @xmath0@xmath92 hcn detections and some of the meaningful limits are submillimeter galaxies without a known luminous agn , but are still offset from the local @xmath11/@xmath5 relation .",
    "it thus appears unlikely that agn heating alone can account for the higher average @xmath11/@xmath5 in the high-@xmath0 galaxy sample .      even when assuming the highest @xmath11/@xmath5 of 2835 found among all hcn - detected galaxies in table [ tab-2 ] , the depth of our observations is sufficient to detect a galaxy with the redshift and @xmath11 of j1148 + 5251 ( @xmath0=6.42 ) in hcn emission at a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath94.5 .",
    "to first order , our lower limit thus is consistent with previous suggestions ( g07 ) that @xmath22/@xmath5 ratios in high redshift sources lie systematically above those for nearby galaxies .",
    "the scatter around this trend is still significant , and will primarily be improved by increasing the number of hcn - detected galaxies at high @xmath0 . in addition , it will be important to improve on the main sources of error for the individual high-@xmath0 detections ( e.g. , signal - to - noise limited hcn / co linewidth ratio , accuracy of the fir sed fit , agn bias of @xmath11 ) .",
    "the statistical and individual results , so far , would even be consistent with an even stronger increase in @xmath22/@xmath5 toward the highest @xmath0 and/or @xmath11 .",
    "our study of j1148 + 5251 may hint at such an effect . clearly , it is desirable to obtain more sensitive observations of this source to further investigate this issue .",
    "due to its superior collecting area and high calibrational stability , the vla is ideally suited for such a sensitive study .",
    "although j1148 + 5251 is the most co- and fir - luminous @xmath0@xmath96 galaxy known , 80hr of vla observations were necessary to obtain the current limit . in a favourable case",
    ", the  line may have a strength of about 1.5 times the current rms . to obtain a solid 5@xmath38 detection of such a line , of order 1000hr of observations with the vla would be required .",
    "due to improved receivers and antenna performance , the fully operational evla will be by a factor of two more sensitive to spectral lines of several 100  width ( such as in j1148 + 5251 ) , but will still require long integration times .",
    "studies of dense gas at @xmath0@xmath96 thus appear to require an order of magnitude increase in collecting area , such as offered by future facilities like the ska phase i demonstrator ( e.g. , carilli @xcite ) , which can serve as a low frequency counterpart to the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) .",
