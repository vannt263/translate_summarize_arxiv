    "the atacama large millimeter and submillimeter array ( alma ) , the largest millimeter and submillimeter interferometer ever built , is currently under construction in the northern chile with the collaboration between east asia , europe , and north america @xcite .",
    "the alma is composed of up to eighty high - precision antennas , located on the chajnantor plain of the chilean andes in the district of san pedro de atacama , 5000  m above sea level .",
    "the alma covers the wavelength range from 0.3  mm to 9  mm with an angular resolution of up to . the atacama compact array ( aca ) is designed to improve the short baseline coverage of the alma , especially for the observations of extended structures at submillimeter wavelength @xcite .",
    "the aca consists of four 12  m telescopes to obtain the single - dish data and twelve 7  m telescopes to obtain short baseline interferometric data .    however , ground - base astronomical observations in the millimeter and submillimeter ranges are strongly affected by the fluctuation of the tropospheric water vapor distribution ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the correction of phase fluctuations due to the spatial and temporal variations of the tropospheric water vapor content is extremely important in millimeter and submillimeter interferometry .",
    "several kinds of techniques have been proposed and performed for reducing phase fluctuations in millimeter and submillimeter interferometry ( see @xcite for a review ) , such as fast switching phase calibration @xcite , paired array phase calibration @xcite , and radiometric phase calibration @xcite .",
    "although the alma site is one of the best sites for the millimeter and submillimeter astronomy @xcite , atmosphere in this area is often affected by the phase fluctuations due to water vapor @xcite .",
    "the phase correction methods for the alma and the aca are therefore highly needed to be considered and tested .",
    "@xcite conducted a series of simulations of a phase correction scheme for the aca using water vapor radiometers ( wvrs ) .",
    "the wvrs can measure the tropospheric water vapor content directly with observing a water vapor line in centimeter or millimeter wavelength . in the proposed aca phase calibration scheme ,",
    "the wvrs are attached to the 12  m antennas at the four corners of the twelve 7  m array ( hereafter we call this as the reference rectangle ) .",
    "the changes of the tropospheric water vapor content aloft measured with the wvrs is transferred into the excess path lengths of the arriving radio waves .",
    "the excess path lengths measured at the four corners of the reference rectangle are then fitted to a simple two - dimensional slope or a screen .",
    "then the phases of the antennas inside the reference rectangle can be compensated and calibrated .",
    "their simulation succeeded to compensate the atmospheric phase well , which strongly support the use of the proposed phase correction scheme .    to confirm this simulation study observationally and discuss further , we performed the proposed phase correction scheme for the aca using the submillimeter array ( sma ; @xcite ) . here",
    "we present measurements with the sma at 230  ghz , analyze the datasets under the proposed scheme , and discuss the results of the corrected phase variations .",
    "our experiment is to clarify how effectively the proposed compensation scheme works under the conditions of the real atmosphere .",
    "we construct a reference triangle composed of three antennas , and make a flat phase plane or a screen with observing a strong point source ( section  [ sect - mdr ] ) . the phases of antennas inside the reference triangle can be interpolated , while the phases of antennas outside can be extrapolated .",
    "we then compare the observed and the predicted phases of the point source .",
    "standard deviations and temporal structure functions of the observed ( uncorrected ) and the corrected phases are also compared ( section  [ sect - res ] ) .",
    "finally , we discuss the usefulness of the interpolation and extrapolation phase correction schemes using a phase screen , and also discuss the validity of the `` frozen - flow '' hypothesis ( section  [ sect - dis ] ) .",
    "the purpose of our experiment is to investigate observationally the proposed phase compensation method for the aca using the sma .",
    "the reasons of using the sma for this experiment are that the sma is the interferometer operating at submillimeter wavelength , which is the same as the aca , and that the antenna configuration of the array is applicable for this experiment .",
    "the aca uses the wvrs for the phase compensation , but for this experiment using the sma , since the sma does not have wvrs , we observed a strong point source to measure the phase directly to perform the proposed aca phase conpensation method .",
    "the measurements were carried out on august 26 , 2004 using all eight antennas of the sma on mauna kea in hawaii , and on september 7 , 2004 using seven antennas ( the antenna 8 was not used in this measurement ) .",
    "the antenna configuration is depicted in figure  [ fig - conf ] .",
    "the shortest and the longest baseline lengths are 11.6  m ( antenna 1 to antenna 8) and 179.2  m ( antenna 4 to antenna 6 ) , respectively .",
    "the measurements were performed at 240.0  ghz for the august 26 , 2004 measurement and 230.5  ghz for the september 7 , 2004 measurement ( both frequencies are at the upper side band ) .",
    "correlator bandwidth in both measurements was 2  ghz for each side band .",
    "we observed b@xmath1 ( j@xmath2 ) in both days for 1.157 and 0.469 hours , respectively , with the integration time for one data point ( one integration number ) of 5.16 seconds .",
    "the integration number is the number of our data recorded every integration time since the measurements started , and the ranges of the integration number for the target source turned to be 2321  3128 and 140  467 for the august 26 and september 7 measurements , respectively .",
    "the 230  ghz flux density of this source at the time was about 6 jy , strong enough to detect in one integration with high signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the data were stored in the sma data archive directories 040826_01:23:23 and 040907_05:22:09 .",
    "hereafter we call the former dataset as `` 040826 '' and the latter `` 040907 '' .",
    "( 80mm,100mm)figure1.eps        we reduced the data using the owens valley radio observatory software package mir adopted for the sma .",
    "we only used the upper side band data .",
    "the data were calibrated based on the antenna - base calibration .",
    "we confirmed that all the final results did not change with the reference antennas in the antenna - base calibration .",
    "here we explain the procedure to construct a phase screen using a reference triangle and the comparison between the observed and estimated phases .",
    "the schematic diagram is depicted in figure  [ fig - screen ] .",
    "[ cols=\"^ , < , < , < , < \" , ]      the degree of the improvement of the phase fluctuation after the phase correction , however , depends on the reference antenna of the antenna - based gain calibration . if the interpolated antenna is close to the reference antenna , the improvement of the phase fluctuation is small , but if the interpolated antenna is far from the reference antenna , the improvement of the phase fluctuation is large .",
    "in addition , the final results , namely the residual phase fluctuations , do not depend on reference antennas . in figure  [ fig - ba ]",
    ", we show examples of the observed and subtracted phases with different reference antennas for the antenna - based gain calibration under the same reference triangle [ 2 , 4 , 7 ] . as can be seen , the standard deviations of the observed phases largely depend on the reference antennas , but that of the subtracted phases converges into one .",
    "furthermore , in case of the interpolation scheme ( figure  [ fig - ba]a ) , subtracted phases improve in all the three reference antenna cases , but in case of the extrapolation scheme ( figure  [ fig - ba]b ) , subtracted phases improve in some reference antenna cases and some do not .",
    "( 160mm,100mm)figure6.eps    these can be explained as follows : observed phase with the antenna x using the antenna @xmath3 as the reference antenna for the antenna - based gain calibration , @xmath4 , can be expressed as @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the absolute phase observed with the antenna x and the reference antenna @xmath3 .",
    "the estimated phase with interpolation or extrapolation , @xmath8 , can be expressed as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the absolute estimated phase at the antenna x. both of the above equations depend on the absolute phase of the reference antenna @xmath3 . on the other hand ,",
    "the final result , which is the subtraction between the observed and the extimated phases , is expressed as @xmath11 which does not depends on the reference antenna , and therefore the subtracted phase converged into one result , as shown in figure  [ fig - ba ] .    to evaluate the effectiveness of the phase correction more quantitatively , we re - define the phase to that refers to the center of the reference triangle .",
    "consider a reference triangle composed of three antennas , a , b , and c ( figure  [ fig - convert]a ) .",
    "the observed phases for these three antennas after the antenna - base gain calibration using the reference antenna @xmath3 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , can be expressed as @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath7 are the absolute phases at the three antennas of the reference triangle and at the reference antenna @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "we then consider the phase for the interpolated or extrapolated antenna @xmath21 .",
    "the absolute and the observed phases for the antenna @xmath21 can be expressed as @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively , and the relation between @xmath22 and @xmath23 can be written as @xmath24    now , we re - define the phase , which is , not measure from the reference antenna @xmath3 , but from the center of the triangle ( see figure  [ fig - convert]b ) .",
    "first , we define @xmath25 as @xmath26 we can consider this phase as the phase of the center of the triangle relative to the reference antenna @xmath3 . if we subtract the phase @xmath25 from other phases , these phases will be the phases refer to the center of the triangle : for example , the phase of antenna @xmath21 relative to the center of the reference triangle can be expressed as @xmath27 if we substitute @xmath25 in equation  ( [ eq - avephi ] ) into this equation , the equation can be written as @xmath28                                                       \\nonumber \\\\    & = & \\phi_t - \\frac{1}{3}(\\phi_{a } + \\phi_{b } + \\phi_{c}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the final form of this equation does not include the phase of the reference antenna @xmath29 , and only depends on the absolute phase of the target antenna @xmath30 relative to the absolute phase of the center of the triangle , @xmath31 .",
    "( 160mm,100mm)figure7.eps      we then compare the relationship between the distance from the interpolated / extrapolated antennas to the center of the reference triangle and the subtracted / unsubtracted ( corrected / uncorrected ) root mean square ( rms ) of the phase fluctuation , which is depicted in figure  [ fig - sd ] .",
    "we separated the interpolated and the extrapolated antennas , and also separated the large and small phase fluctuation data for each dataset ( see table  [ tab - def ] ) .",
    "the uncorrected ( observed ) phase fluctuations are similar or increase with the distance from the center of the reference triangle .",
    "the corrected ( subtracted ) phase , on the other hand , shows different behavior between the interpolated and extrapolated results .",
    "the interpolated results show improvement in phase fluctuation , especially for the longer distance antennas , and in most cases , rms phase turned to be constant , or sometimes better in the longer distance antennas than the shorter distance antennas .",
    "this suggests that the phase correction efficiency depends mainly on the distance ; better phase correction efficiency at longer distance .",
    "this may be because the longer distance antennas are closer to an edge of a reference triangle , namely close to a baseline of two reference antennas ( i.e. , one dimension ) , and the estimated phase turns to be closer to the real phase than the two dimension case ( i.e. , estimating phase close to the center of the reference triangle with three antennas ) .",
    "exception for this result is the earlier part ( the integration number range of 140  199 ) of the dataset 040907 ( figure  [ fig - sd]e ; see also figure  [ fig - resid2]a ) , which is largely affected by the @xmath32 ambiguity .",
    "this interpolation result suggests that the phase correction scheme for the aca will work properly , as far as the phase does not fluctuate too large ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the extrapolated results , on the other hand , show improvement in some cases , but often turn to be worse .",
    "generally , the phase fluctuation increases with the distance from the center of the reference triangle .",
    "this indicates that the extrapolation of the phase screen does not work well for the phase correction .",
    "there are huge rises of the corrected phases around the distance of 140  m from the center of the reference triangle in all the extrapolation results ( see figures  [ fig - sd]b , d , f , and h ; compare with the observed rms phases , the corrected rms phases increase significantly ) .",
    "these data points are mostly the extrapolated phases of the antennas 2 , 3 , and 5 from the reference triangle [ 2 , 4 , 6 ] , [ 2 , 4 , 7 ] , [ 3 , 4 , 6 ] , and [ 4 , 5 , 6 ] .",
    "we will discuss this later in section  [ sect - dis-140 m ] .      to characterize the troposheric fluctuation ,",
    "the structure function @xcite is often used . here , to evaluate the time variation of phase quantitatively , we use the temporal structure function , @xmath34 , which can be defined as @xmath35^{2}\\rangle , \\label{eq - tsf}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the characteristic integration time interval ( in our data , this corresponds to the integration number interval ) , and @xmath37 is the phase at integration time @xmath21 .",
    "the angle bracket `` @xmath38 '' means the time ensemble .",
    "we denote @xmath39 as the rms of the temporal structure function @xmath40 .",
    "we compare @xmath39 of the corrected and uncorrected phase for the interpolated and extrapolated data as a function of integration time intervals .",
    "we show some examples in figure  [ fig - temp ] , which displays the temporal structure functions before and after the interpolation scheme on the antenna 1 and that in the extrapolation scheme on the antenna 3 with the reference triangle [ 2 , 4 , 6 ] .",
    "the plots show that rms phase ( corresponds to @xmath39 above ) rises to a maximum value as integration number interval ( corresponds to @xmath36 in the equation  [ eq - tsf ] ) increases , and tend to be flat at this maximum value .",
    "if the maximum value for the corrected phase turns to be lower than the uncorrected phase , the temporal structure function plots tell that the phase correction worked well .",
    "the interpolation scheme improves the phase , while the extrapolation scheme makes the phase fluctuation worse .",
    "in the previous section , we showed that the interpolation phase correction scheme worked well in our experiments , which supports the use of this scheme for the aca . here",
    "we discuss the possible explanations for the success of the interpolation scheme and failure of the extrapolation scheme , the application of our results to the aca phase correction scheme , and the validity of the `` flozen - flow '' model .",
    "the results of our experiments exhibit that the interpolation scheme provides a better phase correction than the extrapolation approach .",
    "the difference between these two schemes can be compared in figure  [ fig-1d ] ( simplified to one - dimensional example ) .",
    "the interpolation scheme is calculated under the three boundary conditions of the three antenna phases surrounding the antennas to be corrected , while the extrapolation scheme is calculated for antennas outside a reference triangle , namely only one boundary condition on one side , and no boundary condition on the other sides .",
    "therefore , the extrapolation results deviate more than the interpolation results due to more degrees of freedom or more uncertainties . furthermore , the distortion of the wave front is caused by the variations of the water vapor distribution in the troposphere that move across an interferometer .",
    "the situation between the atmosphere and the interferometer is depicted in figure  [ fig - frozen ] .",
    "smaller scale water vapor `` clumps '' cause a smaller phase variations , and larger scale `` clumps '' cause a larger phase variations . in case of the interpolation scheme ,",
    "the water vapor clumps larger than the separation of the reference antennas can be corrected by the phase screen , and only the small fluctuation remains .",
    "( 80mm,100mm)figure9.eps    on the other hand , since the extrapolation scheme is calculated with only one boundary condition , the water vapor clumps detected with the reference triangle may not be related to that detected with the extrapolated antennas , and therefore resulted as a large variation of phase ( larger the distance from the center of the reference triangle , larger the phase variations ; but see section  [ sect - dis-140 m ] for the difference in the phase correction results between the antennas located along or perpendicular to the wind direction from the reference triangle ) .",
    "( 80mm,50mm)figure10.eps      although our results support the aca phase correction scheme , there are some differences between our experiments and the proposed scheme .",
    "one is the difference in sites ; our experiments were done at the summit of mauna kea , hawaii , but the alma site is located at chajnantor , chile . therefore the atmospheric conditions between these two sites may have different characteristics . however , past several site testing results using radio seeing monitors indicate that the structure functions , which characterizes the water vapor clumps in the atmosphere , of these two sites do not differ much @xcite .",
    "hence this point will not be a problem .",
    "the other is the difference in the antenna configuration of our tests and the actual configuration of the wvrs in the aca , namely the configuration of a phase screen .",
    "our experiments uses three antennas to create a phase screen , and therefore one phase plane is naturally created without any offset from measured phases .",
    "the aca , however , uses four wvrs , so that a fitting is needed to create a phase screen , which produces some difference between the measured phases and the estimated phase screen .",
    "this difference may create some errors in the phase correction , which leads to larger phase fluctuations after the correction than our results .",
    "indeed , as mentioned in section  [ sect - res - comp2 ] , the phase correction works better near the edge of the reference triangle ( i.e. , near one baseline ) , supporting this concern",
    ". it would be the future study to compare the phase correction results using phase screens derived from three antennas and that from four antennas .",
    "in general cases , the phase fluctuation gradually increases with the increase of distance from the center of the reference triangle to the interpolated or extrapolated antennas in our experiments .",
    "however , as mentioned in section  [ sect - res - comp2 ] , the corrected phases of the extrapolation scheme suddenly rise up around the distance from the center of the reference triangle of 140  m , much more ( almost twice worse ) than the original observed phase fluctuation .",
    "( 80mm,50mm)figure11.eps    the large scatter is possibly due to the orientation ( direction ) of the center of the reference triangle to the extrapolated antennas .",
    "figure  [ fig-140 m ] presents an example configuration of the reference triangle [ 2 , 4 , 6 ] for the extraordinarily large rms phase fluctuation data point for the antenna 3 .",
    "the extraordinary 140  m phase fluctuation data all have similar orientation , which is almost along the north - south direction .",
    "the meteorological parameters on the two observation days show that the prevailing wind direction is either east or west .",
    "this wind direction is almost perpendicular to the orientations of the antenna configurations with the extraordinary 140  m fluctuations on both days ( figure  [ fig-140 m ] ) .",
    "a possible explanation for this extraordinary phenomenon is as follows : the time variations of the atmospheric phase are usually approximated by a `` frozen - flow '' model @xcite : the time scale to develop / cease a turbulence is much longer than the time taken for a turbulent field to pass across the reference triangle by wind .",
    "hence the turbulence of water vapor is generally ` frozen ' in the atmosphere , and the wind transport the water vapor turbulences above an interferometer without changing the size of the turbulences ( figure  [ fig - frozen ] ) . under this `` frozen - flow '' hypothesis , the antennas outside the reference triangle but along the wind direction ( for example , the extrapolated antenna a in figure  [ fig - frozen ] ) , the observed phase will not be largely different from the estimated phase by the extrapolation of the phase screen , since the water vapor turbulences that pass in front of the antennas are similar to that pass in front of the reference triangle .",
    "therefore the phase fluctuation after the phase correction gradually increases with the distance from the center of the reference triangle .",
    "indeed , some of the corrected phases for the extrapolated antennas are improved from the uncorrected phases ( see figure  [ fig - sd ] ) , and most of those extrapolated antennas are located along the wind direction from the reference triangles . however , the antennas outside the reference triangle but perpendicular to the wind direction ( for example , the extrapolated antenna b in figure  [ fig - frozen ] ) , the observed phase will be largely different from the estimated phase by the extrapolation of the phase screen , since the water vapor turbulences that pass in front of the antennas are different from that pass in front of the reference triangle . therefore the phase fluctuation after the phase correction generally make results worse .",
    "the location between the antennas that caused the `` 140  m phase fluctuation '' and the center of the reference triangle is almost perpendicular to the wind direction of the observed days , and other antennas are along the wind direction .",
    "we therefore conclude that the results of the extrapolation scheme including the `` 140  m phase fluctuation '' can be explained by `` flozen - flow '' model .",
    "we performed an interferometric phase correction with the interpolation or extrapolation of the phase screen defined by three reference antennas using the sma .",
    "this interpolation method is proposed for the aca in the alma .    according to the comparisons of the standard deviations of corrected and uncorrected phases , relations between the phase standard deviation and the distance from the center of the reference triangle , and the temporal structure functions of the rms phase",
    ", the interpolation scheme improves phase fluctuation while the extrapolation scheme does not .",
    "this result can be explained by the boundary conditions of phase in these schemes ; in case of the interpolation scheme , the phase corrected antenna is inside the triangle of three reference antennas , so the phase inside the triangle can be well defined ( more known boundary conditions , more precisions or less phase errors and deviations ) .",
    "the extrapolation scheme , on the other hand , only has partial boundary conditions , and therefore less precision .    in the extrapolation scheme results ,",
    "there is a sudden large phase fluctuation at the distance from the center of the reference triangle of about 140  m. according to the meteorological parameters on those observing dates and the antenna configurations , this `` 140  m phase fluctuation '' is occurring only at the antennas located from the center of the reference triangle perpendicular to the wind direction .",
    "this `` 140  m phase fluctuation '' can be explained by the frozen - flow model .    although there are some differences between the configuration of our experiments and that in the proposed phase correction scheme for the aca , our results based on the actual observations and the simulation results done by @xcite promise the success of the phase correction for the aca .",
    "we would like to thank kazushi sakamoto and koh - ichiro morita for fruitful discussion .",
