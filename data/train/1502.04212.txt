    "let us consider a non - convex higher order variational problem in the one - dimensional case , which is the obstacle problem for the energy as proposed in @xcite : @xmath1=\\varepsilon^2 \\int \\kappa^2 ds + \\int ds - \\int_{\\{u=\\psi\\ } } ( 1-\\alpha)\\ ds.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here a smooth function @xmath2\\rightarrow\\mathbb{r}$ ] called an _",
    "obstacle _ ( function ) , a constant coefficient @xmath3 , and a continuous function @xmath4\\rightarrow(0,1)$ ] are given .",
    "the function @xmath5 is an admissible function constrained above the obstacle , and @xmath6 , @xmath7 denote the curvature and the arclength of the graph of @xmath5 respectively . the first term of the energy is called _ bending energy _ , the second term _ tension _ , the third term _",
    "adhesion energy _ , and @xmath8 is called _",
    "adhesion coefficient_. the multiple constant of the tension is normalized to one .",
    "the adhesion coefficient @xmath8 can be inhomogeneous so that it may depend on a space variable . according to @xcite , this problem",
    "is motivated to determine the shape of membranes , interfaces or filaments on rippled surfaces ( as figure [ membranes ] ) in certain mesoscopic or nearly mesoscopic settings .",
    "the coefficients @xmath9 and @xmath8 and the obstacle function @xmath10 depend on the setting of materials , scaling and so on . in this case",
    "the graph of @xmath5 is a membrane . in this paper",
    "we consider the one dimensional model so when one considers a membrane it depends on only one direction and invariant in other direction in our setting .",
    "in addition , we regard the bending energy which is a higher order term as a perturbation , that is , only consider for sufficiently small @xmath3 .",
    "cc    , width=188 ]    , width=188 ]    a characteristic point of this energy is to contain the adhesion energy . by this energy",
    ", surfaces shall reasonably adhere to the obstacle in order to decrease the energy .",
    "accordingly , there may occur patterns as drawn in figure [ membranes ] in this model .",
    "however that law is complicated .",
    "one of physical and mathematical concerns is to perceive such pattern formation .",
    "we shall first take the simplest approximation @xmath11 in order to consider the case @xmath9 is sufficiently small .",
    "this approximation simplifies the problem ( [ problem1 ] ) thus we can obtain many fine properties for minimizers ( this is one of the important results of this paper , see theorem [ regezero ] ) .",
    "it is rigorously stated in theorem [ regezero ] , but roughly speaking the shape of any minimizer of @xmath12 is as drawn in figure [ membrane ] .",
    "there occur `` edge '' singularities at the free boundary and their angles are determined by the adhesion coefficient at the place of the free boundary , symbolically @xmath13 ( young s equation ) .",
    "this condition has been formally given in @xcite .",
    "however , even if @xmath11 , the energy is not convex and may admit that there exist multiple minimizers lacking consistency in their shape .",
    "that is to say , for instance , either of two different states as drawn in figure [ membrane ] might be a minimizer for the same energy .",
    "since this minimizing problem is considered to be a physical model , this non - uniqueness may be due to some small effect , perhaps , of higher order terms .",
    "therefore , restoring the effect of the bending energy , it is expected to ameliorate the approximation .",
    "cc     [ membrane],width=188 ]     [ membrane],width=188 ]    the main goal of this paper is a formulation of a singular perturbation by the bending energy , that is , to characterize the limit of minimizers of @xmath14 as @xmath15 rigorously . to this end",
    "we utilize the notion of @xmath0-convergence established by de giorgi @xcite in the 70 s ( more precisely , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) which is a convergence of energy functionals for minimizing problems .",
    "the idea of this convergence is to identify the first nontrivial term in an asymptotic expansion for the energy of perturbed problems .",
    "our main singular limit result is rigorously stated in theorem [ gammathm ] , but roughly speaking as follows :    [ mainthm1 ] if we define the singular limit energy @xmath16 by @xmath17:=\\int_{\\partial\\{u>\\psi\\}}4(\\sqrt{2}-\\sqrt{1+\\alpha})\\ d\\mathcal{h}^0,\\ ] ] then the @xmath0-convergence holds with respect to @xmath18-norm : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a certain space of admissible functions @xmath21 .    from this theorem , the following asymptotic expansion is also valid for our problem in some sense ( see @xcite , @xcite ) : @xmath22 thus it means that @xmath16 is the main effect of the bending energy and its quantity only depends on the @xmath23-measure ( the number ) of the free boundary and the adhesion coefficient there .",
    "since the adhesion coefficient at the free boundary determines the contact angle there ( @xmath13 ) as mentioned above , it also means that the effect is determined by the number of `` edge '' singularities and their angles .",
    "thanks to our singular limit result and geometrical intuition for the minimizing problem of @xmath16 , we can easily find a key effect of the bending energy .",
    "for example , if @xmath24 and there are multiple minimizers of @xmath12 then the one which has less number of edges shall be a minimizer of @xmath14 when @xmath3 is sufficiently small . more precisely , by theorem [ mainthm1 ] and the fundamental theorem of @xmath0-convergence , we obtain the following :    [ limitcoro ] if @xmath25 in @xmath18 and any @xmath26 is a minimizer of @xmath14 in ( [ problem1 ] ) , then @xmath5 minimizes @xmath16 among minimizers of @xmath12 in ( [ problem1 ] ) .",
    "it turns out that we can characterize the limit of minimizers of @xmath27 as @xmath15 by our theorem .",
    "an important point of our proof of theorem [ mainthm1 ] is to prove the liminf condition of @xmath0-convergence ( see definition [ gammaconv ] ) . the proof is mainly separated into two parts .",
    "the first part is to prove that it suffices to consider more regular sequences which are `` close '' to a minimizer of @xmath12 in some sense .",
    "to state it rigorously , we introduce a notion called _ @xmath28-associate _ which explains closeness of functions .",
    "especially , the part regarding how to coincide with @xmath10 is a key point because adhering or detaching leads to a discontinuous transition in our energy .",
    "we replace a general sequence by @xmath28-associate of @xmath29-regularity converging to a minimizer of @xmath12 so that all quantities in the energy are well - defined with no increase of the energy .",
    "the second part is to obtain a lower estimate for functions @xmath28-associated with a minimizer of @xmath12 . by this procedure , we are able to handle the energy geometrically and establish a modica - mortola type inequality to prove the liminf condition .",
    "now let us briefly survey some mathematical problems related to our problem from two viewpoints",
    ".      in the non - adhesive case @xmath30 , the energy in ( [ problem1 ] ) is consisting of the total squared curvature functional and the length functional : @xmath31 so - called _ euler",
    "s elastic energy_. the critical points of the energy are called _ elastica _ ( usually under boundary conditions and the length constraint for a curve @xmath32 ) .",
    "this problem is first considered by euler in 1744 @xcite .",
    "numerous authors have considered this variational problem or related problems under various constraints in order to analyze the configuration of elastic bodies ( see @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite including a very well - written summary of the history of elastic problems by one section ) . however , there are still many unclear points in this problem because of difficulties of a higher order problem .",
    "our problem is the variational problem for the euler s elastic energy with the adhesion term under an obstacle - type constraint , thus it seems to have similar difficulties . to circumvent such difficulties",
    ", we regard the bending energy as a perturbation in this paper .    obstacle problems , which are variational problems under obstacle - type constraints , are motivating problems invoking free boundaries and have been studied for a long time ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a typical model is for the area functional ( or the dirichlet energy , the linearized version ) : @xmath33 under a boundary condition . here",
    "@xmath5 is a function on a bounded smooth domain @xmath34 .",
    "this is so - called the unilateral plateaux problem .",
    "this problem invokes the free boundary @xmath35 and in the non - coincidence set @xmath36 the graph of a solution @xmath5 is a minimal surface ( or harmonic ) . generally ,",
    "if an energy is convex , bounded and coercive in a sense as ( [ problem3 ] ) then the classical variational inequality approach can work .",
    "thus we can obtain many fine properties of solutions ( at least in the linearized case ) , for instance the uniquely existence , further the regularity of solution and of its free boundary @xcite .",
    "the problem ( [ problem3 ] ) corresponds to the case no bending @xmath11 and no adhesion @xmath30 in our problem ( [ problem1 ] ) . in the problem ( [ problem3 ] )",
    ", we only obtain a natural singular limit even if the energy is perturbed by bending ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 9.5 ) .",
    "therefore , in the non - adhesive case , it seems that higher order terms can be neglected when @xmath37 unlike our problem .",
    "our problem is closely related to the alt - caffarelli type variational problem @xcite which is a model of cavitation : @xmath38 under a boundary condition , where @xmath39 is a certain function .",
    "this is not an obstacle problem explicitly but the solutions are automatically constrained above zero , thus it is equivalent to the problem with the constraint @xmath40 ( flat obstacle problem ) .",
    "this problem is one of important interface models and has been generalized variously ( for example , see @xcite generalizing the first term , @xcite the second term , or their references ) . especially , yamaura @xcite considered a non - linearized case , namely the case that the first term is replaced to the area functional .",
    "our problem is a generalization of the ( one - dimensional ) non - linearized alt - caffarelli problem regarding obstacle .",
    "indeed , if @xmath11 and @xmath41 in ( [ problem1 ] ) then it is equivalent to @xmath42 since @xmath43 in @xmath44 .",
    "thus the result in this paper is particularly valid for ( [ problem4 ] ) with area functional instead of the dirichlet energy and with continuous @xmath45\\rightarrow(0,1)$ ] .      in view of singular perturbation by @xmath0-convergence for variational problems ,",
    "there are some related results especially in phase transition models .",
    "one of the most celebrated results is , owing to modica - mortola @xcite ( and @xcite , @xcite ) , for the energy arising from the van der waals - cahn - hilliard theory of fluid - fluid phase transitions : @xmath46 where @xmath47 satisfying a volume constraint and @xmath48 is a double - well potential function ,",
    "usually it is taken as @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "they proved that the singular limit ( @xmath0-limit ) of the energy is proportional to the area of a transition layer .",
    "these works are generalized to the vector - valued case , anisotropic cases and multi - well potential cases ( see @xcite and references cited there ) .",
    "furthernore , there are several higher order version results for the following energy : @xmath51 one of the earliest studies is for the functional arising from the theory of smectic liquid crystals introduced by aviles - giga @xcite .",
    "the authors considered the case that @xmath52 satisfies certain boundary conditions and @xmath48 is a `` single - circle - well '' potential @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "the energy ( [ problem5 ] ) or ( [ problem6 ] ) or similar one also arises from , for example the theory of solid - solid phase transitions , thin - films and magnetism .",
    "there are several singular limit results for them ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the number of results of higher order singular perturbations are limited compared with the first order cases .",
    "our result is one of the higher order singular perturbations and means that the problem ( [ problem1 ] ) can be regarded as a phase transition model as above .",
    "the cost of transition between the phase @xmath55 and @xmath36 is determined by the place of a transition layer .    as mentioned above , a key point in our proof of the liminf condition of @xmath0-convergence",
    "is to reduce a general sequence to a sequence which is easy to handle .",
    "we mention that this concept resembles the `` slicing '' technique used in @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in  [ presec ] we prepare some notations and definitions . in  [ ezerosec ] we first consider the case @xmath11 and derive some properties of minimizers of @xmath12 .",
    "they are useful to prove our singular limit result . in  [ gammaconvsec ] we state our main singular limit theorem ( theorem [ gammathm ] ) , and we prove it in  [ liminfsec ] and  [ limsupsec ] .",
