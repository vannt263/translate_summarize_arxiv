    "in a previous work @xcite we introduced conical manifolds as submanifolds of @xmath0 , giving the following definition :    [ defvarieta ] a conical manifold @xmath1 is a complete @xmath2-dimensional @xmath3 sub manifold of @xmath4 which is everywhere smooth , except for a finite set of points @xmath5 . a point in @xmath5",
    "is called vertex .",
    "these kind of manifold have many common features with other singular manifolds present in literature , as the _ cone - manifolds _ studied by hodgson and tysk @xcite , the _ piecewise linear manifolds _ ( see , e.g @xcite ) , or the _ orbifolds _ ( @xcite ) ; in @xcite these links are briefly examined .    furthermore , the geodesic problem on a singular manifold is studied by degiovanni and morbini , in @xcite . in section [ sezconfronto ]",
    "we will point out the common feature and the main differences between our approach and the degiovanni and morbini one .    in our previous work we gave the following definition of geodesic , which seems to be appropriate for these kind of problems ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition 2 ) ) .",
    "[ defgeod ] a path @xmath6,m)$ ] is a geodesic iff    *   the set @xmath7 is a closed set without internal part ; * @xmath8\\smallsetminus t$ ] ; * @xmath9 is constant as a function in @xmath10 .    by this definition",
    ", we were able to prove a deformation lemma that allows us to apply the main theorems of the calculus of variation in the large .",
    "in particular we can estimate the number of geodesics using the ljusternik - schnirelmann theory ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1 ) ) .    in this work",
    "we will associate to each geodesic @xmath11 an index @xmath12 similar to the morse index , that allows us to obtain some information on the qualitative properties of the geodesics . by this index we state also",
    "an analogous of the morse relations that hold in the smooth case .    as usual , given @xmath13 , we set @xmath14,{\\mathbb r}^n)|\\gamma(0)=p,\\gamma(1)=q , \\gamma([0,1])\\subset m \\right\\},\\ ] ] the suitable path space , and a functional @xmath15 @xmath16 moreover we set @xmath17 @xmath18 under suitable assumption , if @xmath1 is a generic smooth manifold , we know that the following morse relations hold .",
    "@xmath20 where @xmath21 is the set of geodesics , @xmath22 is the poincar polynomial ( in the variable @xmath23 ) of the couple @xmath24 , @xmath25 is a formal series with coefficient in @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the morse index of the geodesic @xmath11 , i.e. the signature of the second variation of the energy .",
    "furthermore , if we take a geodesic @xmath11 s.t . @xmath28 and @xmath29 for some @xmath30",
    ", then we have that @xmath31 ( for some references on morse theory the reader can check , for example @xcite , @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "coming back to conical manifold , the usual definition of @xmath27 makes no sense since the energy is not differentiable .",
    "however , under suitable assumptions , we can define the index of a geodesic as the formal polynomial @xmath32 according to ( [ morseclass3 ] ) . in this case",
    "the morse relations ( [ morseclass ] ) and ( [ morseclass2 ] ) become @xmath33 @xmath34 in this work we prove that @xmath12 is a good definition , i.e. does not depends on @xmath35 and that ( [ morseconic ] ) and ( [ morseconic2 ] ) hold .",
    "we have also that , while in a smooth manifold , for a generic geodesic , @xmath12 is a monome in @xmath23 , for a geodesic in a conical manifold this is not true . then we have introduce the multiplicity of a geodesic ( definition [ mult ] ) as @xmath36 we show some examples in which an high multiplicity , or a 0 multiplicity of a geodesic occurs .",
    "also , the definition of index that we give , allows us to make a comparison between our approach to conical manifold and the approach of degiovanni , marzocchi and morbini ( section [ sezconfronto ] ) , which is based on the concept of the _ weak slope _ ( see @xcite ) , and was presented in @xcite",
    "in this section we present some peculiarities of the study of geodesics in conical manifold , which motivate definition [ defgeod ] .",
    "also , we resume briefly some result contained in @xcite which will be useful for this paper .",
    "usually there are two ways to introduce geodesics in a smooth manifolds : at first we can formulate a cauchy problem , i.e. , given @xmath37 , @xmath38 , we look for a continuous curve @xmath39 s.t .",
    "@xmath40 otherwise we can choose a suitable path space and an energy functional , for example , the space @xmath41 and the functional @xmath42 previously defined , and we look for critical points of the energy .",
    "contrarily to the smooth case , these two methods are not equivalent for manifolds which have conical singularities , and each one of them have some peculiarity .",
    "if we try to solve the cauchy problem we have neither uniqueness nor continuous dependence from starting condition : david stone ( see @xcite , @xcite ) showed that there are piecewise linear manifold with a vertex @xmath43 ( indeed a special case of conical manifolds ) in which , given a point @xmath44 , there is a family of minimal geodesics solving ( [ pbcau ] ) that are the same straight line between @xmath44 and @xmath43 , then start again from @xmath43 with different angles .",
    "so ( [ pbcau ] ) has many solutions , and there is no reasonable criterion to choose one of these geodesics instead of another .",
    "now , taken an euclidean half cone , we can represent it as a circular sector in a plane , in which the straight edges are identified .",
    "taking @xmath43 on these edges , we represent the geodesics as straight lines starting from @xmath43 . in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] we show two sequence of geodesics , respectively the continuous and the dotted lines , approaching the edges of the circular sector . it is easy to see that a dotted and a continuous line can not be too close , even if they approach the geodesic which start from @xmath43 and goes to the vertex . even in a familiar case",
    "we are not able to say how can a geodesic pass through the vertex , in order to have continuous dependence from initial data .",
    "also , if we take two points , say @xmath43 and @xmath44 , symmetrical respect to the vertex , we can say that there are always two minimal geodesics joining them , even if @xmath43 and @xmath44 are as close as we want ; so it is not possible to define a normal neighborhood of the vertex .",
    "thus we can not hope to define a global exponential map .",
    "the functional approach , on the contrary , gives us an easy result on minimal geodesics . to finding",
    "minima is useful to extend @xmath42 in the whole space    @xmath45,{\\mathbb r}^n)|\\ \\gamma(0)=p,\\gamma(1)=q\\right\\}\\ ] ]    and to look at minima of @xmath42 with the constraint @xmath46 ; in this way we know that @xmath42 is lower semi continuous for the @xmath47-weak topology and the set @xmath48 is weakly compact in @xmath49 , because @xmath1 is complete : then the problem @xmath50 has a solution , and we can formulate the following theorem .",
    "[ min ] let @xmath1 be a conical manifold ; let @xmath51 .",
    "then , the energy functional @xmath52 has a minimum .    just proved .",
    "however , this approach is not completely useful , because the energy is not smooth , so there is no easy way to define a critical point of energy different from minimum . in the cited work we gave a",
    "_ generalized _ definition of geodesic ( definition 2 ) which seems to be the right one for these kind of problems .",
    "in fact , although this is a local definition , it let us show two deformation lemmas typical of the calculus of variation in the large ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2 and theorem 7 ) ) .",
    "this lemmas are crucial for this work and are briefly recalled here . in the next section",
    "we will provide also some sketch of the proof of these results .",

    "these lemmas allow us to prove that the definition of the index @xmath12 is a good definition .",
