    "low frequency ( 330 - 200  mhz ) rf is needed for phase rotation and early cooling in the currently proposed neutrino factory  @xcite and muon collider  @xcite designs .",
    "the magnitude of the required magnetic fields are of the order of 1.75  t for the phase rotation and around 3  t in the early cooling lattices .",
    "the rf gradients specified are between 12 and 15  mv / m  @xcite .",
    "experimental data exists on the operation of 805  mhz vacuum rf in magnetic fields .",
    "these were obtained with two very different cavity types : 1 ) a multi - cell cavity with open irises  @xcite , and 2 ) a single ` pillbox ' cavity with irises closed with cu plates or be windows  @xcite,@xcite .",
    "both showed significant problems and will be discussed in this article .",
    "there is very little data on operations of 201  mhz vacuum cavities in significant magnetic fields , although experiments are underway with local fields of about 1  t on a limited part of the cavity .",
    "tests are planned for the 201  mhz cavity in fields of the order of 3  t and geometries that can be made close to those in the machine designs .",
    "there is also data on the dc operation of a test cavity in high pressure hydrogen gas that showed no magnetic field dependence  @xcite .",
    "however , there may be other problems arising when an ionizing beam passes through such a gas filled cavity ; in addition , such gas filled cavities can not be used in the later stages of cooling for a muon collider because the coulomb scattering in the gas would cause too much emittance growth .",
    "we first discuss the gas filled cavity experiments and the possible problems with their use with ionizing beams ; then we consider the experiments and models of vacuum cavities ( no gas in them ) in magnetic fields .",

    "it was found that at lower pressures , the breakdown gradient follows the paschen prediction , but at higher pressures the gradient is limited to values ( 50  mv / m for cu ) close to those observed ( @xmath0 in the open multi - cell cavity discussed in sec .",

    "this similarity in the observed maximum gradients suggests that the initiating mechanism for breakdown in the high pressure gas , and vacuum cavities is the same .",

    "tollestrup  @xcite has studied the likely effects of a muon beam passing through gas filled rf cavities .",
    "it is concluded that the lifetime of the electrons and ions produced by the ionization of those beams are long compared with the likely duration of the muon beams .",
    "it is further concluded that such electrons in the cavity will be driven backwards and forwards as the rf voltage oscillates , and that this will lead to heating of the gas and loss of the rf energy .",
    "the final @xmath1 of three different cavities exposed to @xmath2 muons are estimated and given in table  [ tab : table1 ] .",
    ".[tab : table1 ] final @xmath1 of three cavities . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]      the above is a very approximate analysis .",
    "a full simulation of the problem is being pursued .",
    "the simulations were done with uniform magnetic field ; tracks were only simulated from the single maximum gradient location ; electron impacts were assumed at @xmath3 to the surface ; the thermal diffusion calculation ignored the rise time shape and used an approximate calculation ; both current scale and space charge strength were normalized to fit data . however",
    ", if this simple approach can qualitatively fit the data , it should allow a qualitative extrapolation to 201  mhz and other materials .",
    "a fuller simulation should provide more quantitative results . the red curved line in fig .",

    "these data ( not shown ) lie at somewhat lower breakdown gradients and presumably correspond to a now higher value of the fowler - nordheim @xmath5 .",
    "but since @xmath5 , has not been redetermined from dark current measurements of the damaged cavity , this analysis with that data is not possible .",
    "the black line in the plot shows the dependence predicted by the twist model  @xcite , which does not fit the data well .",
    "the dashed lines show the calculated breakdown limits for be .",
    "the horizontal red line indicates the gradient limit from the assumed model without magnetic fields , assuming the local field limit to be 7  gv / m .      without an external magnetic field , breakdown gradients",
    "have been observed to follow approximately a @xmath6 behavior ( see .",
    "[ vacnofield ] ) . under the assumptions used here  @xcite ,",
    "the local field at breakdown is independent of the frequency ; this implies that @xmath5 decreases approximately as @xmath7 using this assumption , and using the appropriately modified diffusion depth , the predicted breakdown limits at 201  mhz , for cu ( solid blue line ) and be ( dashed blue line ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fit ] . the predicted 201  mhz breakdown gradients",
    "are seen to be a factor of 2 to 2.5 below those for 805  mhz .",
    "this factor comes primarily from the higher expected @xmath5 , but also from the longer rf pulse duration and thus longer time to heat and melt the surfaces . at the higher gradients specified for neutrino factory phase rotation and cooling ( 15  mv / m at b@xmath8 3  t )",
    "are well above this prediction .",
    "the pillbox cavity used in the above experimental study has , more recently , been tested  @xcite with one of its two be window replaced by a flat cu plate with an easily replaceable central ` button ' .",
    "the button had dimensions such that the local field on the tip was 1.7 times that on the outer cu ` iris ' .",
    "the intent was to allow a study of magnetic field dependent breakdown as a function of materials , the assumption being that breakdown would occur at the high gradient on the tip of the button .",
    "the cavity was found to operate with gradients on the button significantly higher ( by approximately a factor of 1.7 ) than had been observed without the button .",
    "it was noted however that this breakdown occurred with gradients on the iris , and on the flat support plate , that were essentially the same as those present without the button .",
    "this suggested that breakdown was not occurring on the button , but rather at other locations that did not have the 1.7 times field enhancement : on the irises and/or the flat button support plate .",
    "when the cavity was later disassembled it was indeed found that was there little damage on the button , where the field was maximum .",
    "but there was significant damage in a distinct band from 3 to 6  cm on the tin coated cu support plate ( see fig .",
    "[ button]a ) .    these observations are consistent with the breakdown mechanism described in this paper .",
    "superfish  @xcite calculations showed that the fields on the be window opposite the button and support plate were maximal just in the band 3 to 6  cm , where the damage was observed ( see fig .  [ button]b ) . in this model , emission from the cu button , falling on the be is less liable to cause damage and breakdown , whereas the emission from the be focused onto the cu plate should cause damage just where the gradients were maximal on the be .",

    "there are several possible approaches to these breakdown problems in a muon collider or neutrino factory .",
    "* redesign the phase rotation and cooling channels to use lower rf fields .",
    "this approach would clearly hurt performance , and , in addition , risks a slow deterioration of performance as occasional breakdown events continue to spray cu around the cavity - as observed in the pillbox tests .",
    "* use cooling lattices with high pressure hydrogen gas in the rf cavities .",
    "no degradation of rf performance has been observed in a small 805  mhz test cavity with axial magnetic fields and rf gradients similar to those in vacuum cavities .",
    "if the loading from beam induced electrons is not a problem , or is slowed by introducing gas impurities , then this solution should offer no loss of performance in early cooling stages .",
    "but to cool to very low emittances , it will probably require lattices with lower courant snyder @xmath9 at the absorber than can be achieved in the rf . in this case , the addition of hydrogen gas at the higher @xmath9s in the rf would cause unacceptable emittance growth .",
    "so for later cooling , high pressure hydrogen gas is probably not a solution .",
    "* build cavities with exceptionally good surfaces so that the @xmath5 is sufficiently low initially that no breakdown occurs . with atomic layer deposition ( ald )",
    "this may be a realistic option  @xcite .",
    "the fear would be that a single breakdown spoils the surface in such a way that there will be a cause of further breakdown and a conditioning that approaches the same gradient limits seen in a conventional cavity .",
    "* design lattices with magnetic field shielded from the rf .",
    "the above prediction suggests that so long as the field is less than about 0.2  t , no adverse effects will be observed .",

    "further 805  mhz tests would be needed to explore solutions for these lower frequencies .",

    "the ` pillbox ' cavities that have so far been tested have relatively complex shapes , and the simulations of their performance with fields in differing directions are complex .",
    "it would thus be desirable to test a simple pillbox shaped cavity whose performance would be far easier to simulate . the cavity should be designed so that it can be mounted in the center of the of the lab g magnet in at least two orientations : with its axis parallel to the solenoids and perpendicular to that angle .",

    "the coils would be separately powered so that the sensitivity to deviations from the insulated condition can be studied .",
    "the rf cavity would be operated at liquid nitrogen temperatures in order to minimize the radiation falling on the superconducting coils that will be very close to its surfaces . there would be a vacuum both outside the rf cavity ( for thermal insulation ) and inside the cavity , although the quality of the latter should be higher , and would be separately monitored .",
    "super - insulation and an outer liquid nitrogen shield are needed but not shown .",
    "tuning of the cavity would be provided by axially squeezing or stretching the cavity . a variant of this experiment",
    "would have be windows , making it into more of a pillbox design and raising the accelerating field .",
    "this would not provide such complete magnetic insulation but , because of the special properties of the be might still have acceptable performance .",
    "it is proposed that this and the following experiments would be carried out on a multi - experiment test stand . to allow ease of assembly ,",
    "mounting of instrumentation , and making changes , all connections ( rf , cryogens , magnet and instrumentation leads etc . ) would be brought in through a single support plate ( on the right side in the illustration ) .",
    "the vacuum container would be in the form of a dome that joins to the support plate with a single flange , and can thus be easily removed without disturbing the connections .",

    "the next experiment would be of a multi - cell magnetically insulated cavity ( fig .",
    "[ multi ] ) .",
    "this would test the magnetic insulation in a geometry similar to that required in the 201  mhz acceleration for phase rotation or early cooling .",
    "in addition , it would address the problem of joining cavities inside the bore of the solenoids .",
    "this joint does not need to carry much rf current , nor does it need to hold high vacuum ( since there is vacuum on both sides ) . the method requiring simple axial pressure",
    "is shown in the figure , but other ideas may be explored .",
    "it should be noted that this experiment , and the previous one , test a model of the 201  mhz lattices that would be used in the phase rotation , neutrino factory cooling , and the early cooling in a muon collider .",
    "later 6d cooling will require compact higher field ( 10 - 15  t ) solenoids in order to focus the beams to lower @xmath9 s and thus cool to lower emittances .",
    "test coils could conveniently be tested on the proposed test stand , since it would allow for easy mounting , cooling and testing with easily accessible instrumentation .",

    "the final step would be to add the required hydrogen absorber .",
    "the details of the lattice , whether it is a snake  @xcite or guggenheim  @xcite configuration for instance , would not change the nature of the components needing test . figure  [ later ]",
    "is thus not meant as a definitive design of the required lattice , but rather as a test of the kind of components needed ; the cavity shapes shown are not those with true magnetic insulation .",
    "the true shapes with their coils are yet to be determined .",
    "figure  [ later ] is thus intended only as an illustration of the direction of the required r & d.      the experiments already planned with the 201  mhz cavity in several tesla fields could show satisfactory performance .",
    "if however this is not the case , then whatever solutions are proposed on the basis of the 805  mhz tests will need to be demonstrated at 201  mhz .",
    "the main results and predictions of the model presented in this paper can be summarized as :    * a review of models for breakdown without external magnetic fields suggests that the initiation of breakdown is best explaned by ohmic heating due to field emission current at asperities .",
    "the dependence of breakdown on frequency , pulse length and cavity materials can be explained by the competing processes of asperity destruction and the creation of new asperities .",
    "* we have proposed a model for damage in rf cavities operated in significant axial magnetic fields .",
    "the model fits the existing data reasonably well .",
    "* the model also fits some otherwise surprising results from a pillbox cavity with a be window facing a cu plate with a central button . *",
    "the model predicts relatively low gradient breakdowns at 201  mhz in magnetic fields .",
