    "simulating finite density qcd is one of the outstanding problems in lattice gauge theory @xcite . because of the sign problem",
    "no reliable numerical simulations of finite density qcd with three colors exist even in the strong coupling limit @xcite .",
    "this is a rather frustrating situation in view of the current intense interest in finite density qcd fueled by the phenomenology of heavy ion collisions , neutron stars , early universe and color superconductivity .",
    "therefore even a qualitative description of strongly coupled qcd at finite density using field theoretical methods is quite welcome .",
    "strongly coupled qcd at finite quark chemical potential @xmath0 has previously been studied analytically both in the euclidean @xcite and in the hamiltonian @xcite formulations . except for @xcite ,",
    "the consensus is that at zero or low temperatures strong coupling qcd undergoes a first order chiral phase transition from the broken symmetry phase below a critical chemical potential @xmath1 to a chirally symmetric phase above @xmath1 . in this work",
    "we calculate the equation of state of strongly coupled qcd at finite @xmath0 using wilson fermions and show that in the phase with spontaneously broken chiral symmetry the quark fermi sea has negative pressure indicating its mechanical instability .",
    "this result is in qualitative agreement with those obtained using continuum field theory models with four  point interactions @xcite .",
    "we begin by defining our effective hamiltonian for strongly coupled qcd which was first derived by smit @xcite .",
    "henceforth we adopt the notation of smit @xcite , set the lattice spacing to unity ( @xmath2 ) and work in momentum space .",

    "are denoted by @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively , and summation convention is implied .",
    "three of the four parameters in this theory are the wilson parameter @xmath6 , the current quark mass @xmath10 and the effective coupling constant @xmath11 which behaves as @xmath12 with @xmath13 being the qcd coupling constant .",
    "the fourth parameter @xmath3 is in general _ not _ the total chemical potential @xmath14 of the interacting many body system .",
    "as shown below the interaction will induce a contribution to @xmath14 which is momentum dependent .",
    "we shall therefore refer @xmath3 as the `` bare '' chemical potential .",
    "our strategy is to construct an ansatz which obeys the equation of motion corresponding to @xmath15 at finite @xmath0 and use it to calculate the equation of state of cold and dense quark matter . in free space",
    "this ansatz has the same structure as the free lattice dirac field and obeys the free lattice dirac equation with a mass term which is interpreted as the dynamical quark mass @xcite .",
    "temporarily dropping color and flavor indices , this ansatz is given by @xmath16 the annihilation operators for particles , @xmath17 , and anti ",
    "particles , @xmath18 , annihilate an interacting vacuum state and obey the free fermion anti  commutation relations .",
    "the properties of the spinors @xmath19 and @xmath20 are given in @xcite .",
    "the equation of motion for a free lattice dirac field fixes the excitation energy @xmath21 to be @xmath22 where @xmath23 plays the role of the dynamical quark mass or , equivalently , the chiral gap .",
    "we now introduce temperature @xmath24 and @xmath0 simulatneously into our formalism and take the @xmath25 limit to construct an ansatz for finite @xmath0 .",
    "this is accomplished by subjecting the @xmath17 and @xmath18 operators in eq .",
    "( [ eq : psip ] ) to a generalized thermal bogoliubov transformation as in thermal field dynamics @xcite @xmath26 the thermal field operators @xmath27 and @xmath28 annihilate a quasi  particle and create a quasi  hole at finite @xmath24 and @xmath0 , respectively , while @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the annihilation operator for a quasi  anti  particle and creation opertor for a quasi  anti  hole , respectively .",
    "the thermal annihilation operators annihilate the interacting thermal vacuum state @xmath31 _ for each @xmath24 and @xmath0_. @xmath32 the thermal doubling of the hilbert space accompanying the thermal bogoliubov transformation is implicit in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : avac1 ] ) and ( [ eq : avac2 ] ) where a vacuum state which is annihilated by thermal operators @xmath27 , @xmath33 , @xmath29 and @xmath34 is defined .",
    "since we shall be working only in the space of quantum field operators it is not necessary to specify the structure of @xmath31 .",
    "the thermal operators satisfy the fermion anti ",
    "commutation relations just as the @xmath17 and @xmath18 operators in the free space ansatz .",
    "the coefficients of the transformation are @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , where @xmath39^{-1}$ ] are the fermi distribution functions for particles and anti  particles .",
    "they are chosen so that the total particle number densities are given by latexmath:[\\ ] ] from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ved ] ) we can evaluate the difference of the vacuum energy densities in the wigner ",
    "weyl ( @xmath68 ) and nambu  goldstone ( @xmath69 ) phases of the theory .",
    "we find @xmath70 and therefore the true ground state of our interacting many body system is in the phase with broken chiral symmetry .",
    "having solved the gap equation for the dynamical quark mass we proceed to determine the equation of state of cold and dense quark matter .",
    "we present results obtained with a vanishing current quark mass and wilson fermions for @xmath6 = 0.25 to leading order in @xmath56 since in this case we observe both first and second order chiral phase transitions .",
    "the pressure of the cold and dense quark matter is obtained by numerically evaluating the thermodynamic potential density . in figure  [ fig2 ]",
    "we plot the pressure as functions of quark number density for @xmath11 = 0.8 and 0.9 . in both cases",
    "we find the pressure to be negative in the broken symmetry phase and therefore the quark fermi sea is mechanically unstable with an imaginary speed of sound .",
    "our conclusion regarding the quark matter stability at finite density is consistent with results obtained using the nambu  jona ",
    "lasinio model @xcite and the effective instanton induced t  hooft interaction model @xcite . in both @xcite and @xcite mean field calculations show that cold and dense quark matter is unstable in the phase with spontaneously broken chiral symmetry and lead the authors to speculate the formation of quark droplets reminiscent of the mit bag model .",
    "in this work we studied strongly coupled qcd in the hamiltonian lattice formalism at finite density using wilson fermions . starting from an effective hamiltonian we constructed and an ansatz which exactly diagonalizes the hamiltonian to second order in field operators for all densities .",
    "this ansatz obeys the free lattice dirac equation with a chemical potential term and a mass term which plays the role of the dynamical quark mass .",
    "this mass and the total chemical potential of the interacting many body system were determined to lowest order in @xmath56 by solving a coupled set of equations obtained from the equation of motion .",
    "we find a first order chiral phase transition with naive fermions while the order of the phase transition can be either first or second for wilson fermions . as in earlier studies using continuum four  fermion interaction models",
    "we find that the quark fermi sea is mechanically unstable in the phase with broken chiral symmetry .",
    "our results for the equation of state of cold and dense quark matter should certainly be verified in any future numerical simulation of finite density qcd .",
