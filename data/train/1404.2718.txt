    "the detection of magnetic fields in the cspn has been a subject of considerable interest recently .",
    "the presence of magnetic fields on cspn could shed some light on the magnetic field of planetary nebulae ( pne ) themselves , and hence on the role of magnetic fields on the shaping of pne @xcite . yet",
    ", magnetic fields on cspn have proved elusive and so far , no clear , unambiguous spectropolarimetric detection of a magnetic field in a cspn has been possible @xcite .",
    "spectropolarimetry of cspn is challenging because they are intrinsically faint and must be observed at relatively low spectral resolutions , which leads to cancellations attenuating the , already weak , polarimetric signals . additionally , cspn present a relatively low number of spectral lines , which hampers _ line addition _ techniques that exploit the collective contribution of hundreds ( or even thousands ) of spectral lines to increase the signal - to - noise ratio @xcite .    here",
    "we follow a different approach .",
    "we aim at constraining the magnetic field on cspn statistically , combining the overall information of all available observations to constrain the magnetism of cspn ( in a way similar , but more general , to the analysis of magnetic fields in rr lyrae of * ? ? ?",
    ". a common procedure would be combining the inferred values of the field strengths ( obtained for example , from least - squares fitting ) in a histogram .",
    "however , this is unsuitable because on the one hand , noise introduces large uncertainties and degeneracies in the determination of the field that are not properly propagated when carrying out a histogram ; and on the other , the magnetic field is not a directly measurable quantity , it is _ inferred _ from observations .",
    "consequently , a robust inference of the distribution of magnetic fields in cspn is better done within the bayesian formalism ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a similar approach ) .",
    "in fact , we will follow a hierarchical bayesian approach similar to that recently follower by @xcite to estimate the distribution of eccentricities in the orbits of binary stars and exoplanets ; but unlike them , here , we carry out the full hierarchical bayesian analysis .",
    "in magnetized atmospheres , spectral lines show a characteristic circular polarization pattern dominated by the zeeman effect .",
    "if the zeeman splitting is sufficiently small so that it does not dominate the broadening of the spectral lines , and assuming that the magnetic field is roughly constant along the line of sight ( los ) and has a dipolar topology in the stellar surface , this circular polarization flux pattern @xmath0 can be simply modeled as ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the previous expression can be considered as a multiobject and multiline approach to magnetic field detection .",
    "we do not have any a priori information on @xmath102 , which is a scale variable .",
    "a convenient uninformative prior in these cases is the jeffreys prior @xmath111 because it distributes probability uniformly in the logarithm : it is as likely to find @xmath102 between 0.1 and 1  g , as between 10 and 100  g @xcite .",
    "this prior is improper ( its integral is not finite ) and here , it yields an improper posterior too .",
    "for that reason , a cutoff @xmath112 has to be chosen . for any informative data set ( peaked @xmath113 ) , the value of the cutoff becomes irrelevant but for , perhaps , ridiculously small values ; for less informative ( i.e. , flatter ) @xmath113 , we must check the sensitivity of the results to the value of @xmath112 .",

    "a characteristic of the likelihood displayed in equation ( [ eq08 ] ) is that it only depends on the maximum likelihood estimation of the longitudinal field , @xmath44 and of the coefficients @xmath53 ( the coefficients @xmath115 represent just a scaling of the likelihood and are of no importance for our purpose ) . according to equation ( [ eqa9 ] )",
    ", @xmath53 can be obtained from the uncertainty in the estimation of @xmath44 , as computed by @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can make use of the recent results of @xcite and use their estimations to upgrade our observations",
    ". note that , since their results represent a longitudinal magnetic field averaged on the stellar surface , they have to be multiplied by 4 to account for the dipolar dilution @xcite .",
    "according to fig .",
    "[ fig : posterior_b ] , the addition of the observations of @xcite barely modifies the posterior distribution @xmath114 . the results point to a very small value of @xmath102 .    from the posterior of the hyperparameter",
    ", we derive the posterior probability of the longitudinal field for all the sources as @xmath116 this distribution depends on the cut - off @xmath112 , but only weakly for @xmath112 ranging between @xmath117-@xmath118  g. although we do not display the figure , choosing @xmath119  mg , @xmath15 is below @xmath120250  g in absolute value with 95% probability .",
    "more interesting is to consider the distribution of @xmath4 , the magnetic field strength of the dipole , which can be obtained from the distribution of @xmath15 assuming that the dipole inclination angle of the different cspn is randomly ( isotropically ) oriented in space , which seems reasonable since there is no clear evidence for a preferential orientation of pne themselves @xcite .",
    "this computation is not possible in the general case in which @xmath15 is interpreted as an average longitudinal field over the stellar surface .",
    "then , a - priori , @xmath4 follows a maxwellian distribution : @xmath121 proceeding as above we derive the distribution of dipolar magnetic field strength from all the observed sources as @xmath122 it is interesting to compare this equation with eq .",
    "( 7 ) of @xcite and point out the differences .",
    "although the two formalism assume an isotropic distribution of fields , our approach is more general for the following reasons : i ) we use a fully bayesian approach in which we model the observed stokes profiles to correctly propagate all uncertainties in the observations to the magnetic field distribution , while @xcite use the maximum likelihood estimation of the @xmath15 and ii ) we take into account that each source can have a different magnetic field strength and that it is known with imprecision .",
    "figure [ fig : posterior_bmod ] shows the corresponding probability density function ( solid ) and the cumulative distribution ( dotted ) for the data of @xcite alone and what happens when we add the data of @xcite . from this , the dipolar magnetic field strength is larger than 3 mg and smaller than 400 g with 95% probability . note that this result is independent of @xmath112 , since equation  ( [ eq11 ] ) is not divergent for @xmath123 , unlike equation  ( [ eq10 ] ) .",
    "an important property of @xmath113 is its ability to concentrate for large @xmath124 .",
    "consider , for example , an ensemble of objects with similar spectra that are observed with identical uncertainties @xmath125 ( hence , they have similar @xmath53 ) ; they only differ in their magnetic field strength ( i.e. , @xmath126 ) .",
    "then , the maximum of @xmath113 ( or @xmath127 ) in equation  ( [ eq08 ] ) will lie at @xmath128 where @xmath129 . in the first case ,",
    "the observations are inadequate ( too noisy , and therefore , @xmath53 too large ) , for the estimated @xmath130 to be informative .",
    "@xmath113 is relatively flat near @xmath131 and when multiplied by the jeffreys prior , the posterior clearly diverges towards smaller values , always reaching its maximum a - posteriori ( map ) value at the cut - off , @xmath132 , which is not very helpful .",
    "an illustration of this situation is given by one of the dotted lines in figure  [ fig : posterior_b_newmeasurements ] , which corresponds to an incomplete subset of just four observed objects from table  [ tab : table ] .",
    "the two other dotted lines correspond to different subsets with the same number of objects . in those other cases",
    ", @xmath113 has a maximum at some non - zero value @xmath133 , which is noticeable also in the posterior @xmath134 .",
    "but they are notably wider ( spanning several hundreds of gauss ) than the likelihood obtained from the full set of observed objects ( gray solid line ) . in fact",
    ", it can be shown that for large values of @xmath135 , the width of @xmath113 converges to 0 as @xmath136 .",
    "therefore , @xmath113 becomes more and more informative on the value of @xmath102 as we accumulate observations ( @xmath137 ) , even if the individual observations are too noisy to get a clear detection ( cf .",
    "solid gray line in figure  [ fig : posterior_b_newmeasurements ] ) . in a sense",
    ", this is a generalization of _ multiline addition techniques _ in which the collective contribution of many individual spectral lines from an object is used to increase the signal - to - noise ratio of the polarization pattern @xcite . here , the collective contribution of many different objects contribute to constrain the statistical distribution of fields .",
    "it is also interesting to see how a few _ better _ observations may affect the estimates .",
    "for example , consider that we observed two objects with well - defined @xmath44 , but with a much better precision than up to now ( say , @xmath125 is a factor 100 better ) , i.e. , in case we had a clear detection for some ( perhaps , different ) object .",
    "figure  [ fig : posterior_b_newmeasurements ] shows how @xmath114 change from the original ( solid grey line ) for three different values of @xmath44 .",
    "likewise , we also display in dotted grey line what happens if we only take into account 4 of the available observations .",
    "this demonstrates that , although there is not a single detection of magnetic fields , adding more objects produces a collapse of the posterior .",
    "we have introduced two major simplifications in the method which are not essential .",
    "the first one regards noise estimation .",
    "we have assumed that the variance of the observed quantities ( @xmath125 and @xmath138 ) was known for the derivation the likelihood functions ( see appendix ) , and that they are independent of wavelength .",
    "their actual values have been independently estimated from the intensity fluctuations in the continuum windows between spectral lines . estimating the unknown variance of a set of measurements is a fundamental problem in bayesian theory which can be done independently ( like here ) or consistently within the bayesian analysis itself by assigning ( e.g. , non - informative , jeffreys ) priors to @xmath125 and @xmath138 , and marginalizing these parameters .",
    "we have not pursued this more general approach here to keep our main argument simple .",
    "secondly , the approximation in equation  ( [ eq03 ] ) has allowed the analytical derivation of equation  ( [ eq08 ] ) .",
    "this approximation is accurate beyond the strict limits stated above .",
    "when the more general equation  ( [ eq02 ] ) is required , the integrals in equation  ( [ eq08 ] ) have to be performed numerically using markov chain monte carlo methods or alike , depending on the dimensionality of the problem .",
    "an important characteristic of the analysis presented is that it naturally allows integration of new data to improve the magnetic field estimates .",
    "we have already shown how things change when the data of @xcite is added to the observations of @xcite . from the analysis of all the available observations",
    "so far we have obtained the upper - limit of 400 g.    our analysis here suggests several ways in which such estimates can be improved . as shown above , the mere addition of new observations helps constraining the magnetic field distribution , even when no clear detection in the individual objects is possible",
    ". the constraints on the global distribution can be even stronger when either the new observations have a better ( lower ) noise level , or if clear detection on individual objects is achieved .",
    "the analysis presented in this paper is not limited to any particular spectral range , provided that the weak - field approximation holds .",
    "observations at different spectral windows can be straightforwardly included in the analysis after computing their corresponding @xmath139 , @xmath44 , and @xmath125 values ( although in some cases it might be advisable to consider the general expression for the likelihood ( eq .",
    "( [ eq02 ] ) ) . given that the amplitude of the zeeman stokes @xmath18 scales with @xmath7 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , spectropolarimetry of the paschen and brackett series should be favoured .",
    "the joint analysis of linear and circular polarization would impose stronger constrains on the magnetic field distribution under the , very likely , assumption of isotropic distribution of fields for the observed objects .",
    "the zeeman effect generates linear polarization patterns which are usually smaller than those of circular polarization and that are , in the weak - field approximation , proportional to the square of the transversal component @xmath140 of the magnetic field to the los ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , we understand that the detection of linear polarization is extremely improbable , given that no reliable detection of circular polarization has been achieved so far .    additionally , magnetic alignment of dust grains creates linear polarization in the continuum from which we may infer the presence of a magnetic field ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the information thus obtained is not quantitative and can not be directly included in our formalism .",
    "yet , it may provide important general and symmetry constraints and bounds that could be implemented within the bayesian methodology .",
    "finally , it is clear that the approach presented here can be applied to other sets of objects ( e.g. , white dwarfs ,  ) once they can be assumed to belong to the same magnetic class , i.e. , they are all characterized by the same statistical distribution of fields .",
