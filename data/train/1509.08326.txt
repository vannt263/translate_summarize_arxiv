    "only flip - flops between resonant states ( in the sense of resonant with the applied microwave pulse ) are considered .",
    "most importantly , the nature of the detuning fields , whether effective magnetic fields fields originating from other spins or contributions which are non - magnetic in origin ( in the broad sense that they do not probe the @xmath25 component of the donor , which can be electric fields ) is not well - understood .",

    "we can also include contributions from paramagnetic spin centers ; we can calculate @xmath31 using each randomly generated configuration of spins .",
    "these simulations indicate lorentzian distributions for the calculated @xmath36 distributions .",
    "thus in our simulations we obtain @xmath36 from a randomly generated cauchy distribution , characterised by a half - width @xmath37 .",
    "to this we can also add some other detuning strain component of non - magnetic origin , @xmath38 generated from an independently generated distribution .",
    "we follow convention and consider one of the spins to be the qubit spin of interest ( `` spin a '' ) and all other spins ( whether resonant with the microwave pulse or not ) to be the bath spins ( `` b spins '' ) . the hahn echo decay of spin a",
    ", @xmath39 is constructed from the product of all contributions from pairs formed with the @xmath34-th bath spin : @xmath40 where the sum denotes additional ensemble averaging over @xmath41 randomly generated configurations of donors with spin a at the center ( each involving a product over pairs ) .",
    "we consider first the case where both spins in the @xmath34-th pair are resonant with a microwave pulse . and the effect of the basic hahn sequence @xmath42 .",

    "the important splitting is : @xmath57    it vanishes at the ct as @xmath58 , regardless of the overhauser magnetic splitting @xmath59 , provided it is not large enough to perturb the mixing of the donor spin states ( and hence the values of @xmath12 ) . in our cluster numerics , the @xmath60 are calculated always in the presence of the overhauser field .",
    "but for typical overhauser fields , and even reasonable applied magnetic field gradients @xmath61 , the perturbation to the value of @xmath60 is negligible .    for such resonant spins we obtain , @xmath62 where @xmath63 are simple analytical expressions ( derived in the appendix ) .",

    "the expression is slightly more complicated , but is given in the appendix .    in the mixing regime ( @xmath4 t ) , there are several such non - resonant transitions which are forbidden at high magnetic field @xmath70 which lead to non - zero coupling via @xmath71 terms at low fields due to the mixing .",
    "for example , for the experimentally studied @xmath16 ct at @xmath72 g , there is some non - zero probability of dff at low fields if the neighbouring spin b is in any of the states @xmath73 as well as @xmath74 .",
    "the transition matrix elements for these are given in the appendix .",
    "for each of the @xmath75 configurations in eq.[clusters ] the donors are randomly assigned to one of the @xmath76 spin states of the si : bi system and the appropriate contribution is calculated .",
    "given the modest @xmath70 in the mixing regime , polarisation effects are neglected .",
    "the results of the numerical cluster simulations and averages are shown in fig.[fig2 ] for two densities corresponding to the experiments in @xcite and for @xmath37 ranging from @xmath77 khz .",
    "this figure is a key result of this work .",
    "one striking feature shown at both low and high sample densities is a``saturation point '' where increasing the magnetic detuning no longer causes an increase in the coherence time ; we attribute this to the point at which all non - resonant flip - flop channels are fully suppressed .",
    "the other very evident result is the large difference between this saturation point and the exponential decays which were measured at the ct , which corresponded to a considerably longer @xmath0 time .",
    "to understand the results further , it is insightful to consider some limiting cases of eq.[total ] . for zero detuning , @xmath19 for an esr - allowed transition , eq.[total ] reduces to : @xmath78 } \\label{iddff}\\ ] ] hence we can have @xmath79 ( thus zero decoherence ) at magnetic field values where :    @xmath80    provided the spin pair were in a @xmath44 or @xmath50 and thus yielded a singlet state after the @xmath81 pulse . at these points ,",
    "the i d and dff effects interfere destructively and the hahn echo pulse fully refocuses the full dipolar interaction .",
    "fig.[fig3 ] illustrates a range of such dipolar refocusing points ( drps ) for si : bi . this refocusing effect is stronger than seen in a dynamical decoupling sequence as full",
    "recoupling occurs for arbitrary pulse interval @xmath82 , in a hahn sequence @xmath42 ; but it requires that the spins in the pair are prepared in specific states , thus the effect is not accessible with current ensemble experiments on si : bi but may become feasible in future applications with single spin pairs .",
    "further details of drps are in the appendix .    for the experimentally studied case , at high fields , given detunings typical in silicon , we have only the @xmath27 contribution , thus we obtain @xmath83 and : @xmath84 } \\label{iddff}\\ ] ] in this high - field limit , there is no dff and the behaviour becomes fully insensitive to the overhauser field .",
    "conversely , near the ct , we see that since @xmath85 for the ct states and they are free to flip - flop , while the i d term is eliminated , hence , eq.[total ] reduces to @xmath86 } \\label{dff}\\ ] ] for a dipole allowed esr line . for the ct in the experimental study @xcite , @xmath87",
    "; in the high field ( bare spin ) limit , @xmath88 . in principle , the same spin pairs contribute to both limits , with a one - to - one mapping one can see the i d and dff would involves a simple time rescaling of @xmath89 ^ 2/[\\frac{1}{2}(1+p_u(b_\\text{ct}))(1-p_d(b_\\text{ct } ) ) ] \\approx 8 $ ] .",
    "thus , whatever the couplings distribution and whatever the density or method of ensemble averaging , one might expect a factor @xmath90 increase in @xmath15 at the ct .",
    "this is a significantly smaller enhancement than the factor @xmath91 measured .",
    "we show below that numerics using randomly generated pairs yield good agreement with the widely used i d expression @xcite .",
    "thus , the discrepancy appears to arise entirely at the ct point and is fully independent of the form of the overhauser field ( provided it is of magnetic origin and thus depends on @xmath92 ) .",
    "to a very good approximation , both measured decays as well as the coherence decays calculated here , at either cts and in the instantaneous diffusion high - field limit , were found to be of exponential form : @xmath93 this is in contrast to spectral diffusion , where observed decays are typically @xmath94}$ ] with @xmath95 .",
    "previous approaches to simulation of i d used stochastic approaches @xcite which more naturally give rise to exponentials ; but here however , we use quantum bath methods to calculate the coherence , with no random flip - flop rate introduced as in @xcite . the one - cluster forms @xmath96 are not dissimilar in form to those used for spectral diffusion , thus it is important to understand how the exponential behavior arises . in @xcite two types of clusters employed in modelling nuclear spin",
    "spectral diffusion gave very different decays , although the @xmath96 were of exactly the same form .",
    "the key difference was that in the one case , the bath was numerous , thus the single central - spin decay is representative of all realisations .",
    "in other words the realisation average in eq.[clusters ] ( ie the sum ) @xmath97 is unimportant ; only the cluster product is important .",
    "this behaviour typically gives non - exponential decay .",
    "in contrast , for an alternative mechanism in @xcite only a few clusters contributed appreciably .",
    "thus the behavior fluctuates considerably from one central spin to another ; this case yields decays with exponential character and extensive averaging @xmath98 s is required to obtain smooth decays .    for i d and undamped dff , to a good approximation , the timescale of the decay is set by the single closest neighbouring donor which is resonant or can flip - flop .",
    "the more distant donors mainly serve to damp revivals of the oscillatory coherence functions eq.[iddff ] and eq.[dff ] .",
    "thus we can provide a heuristic ( but quite accurate ) estimate of the coherence decay at the ct as the survival probability of each central spin state .    by using the binomial theorem",
    ", we can show that the probability of a given donor having _ no _ neighbours closer than a distance @xmath99 is : @xmath100 where @xmath101 is a representative mean separation distance .",
    "the dipolar coupling strength at a distance @xmath99 , averaged over orientations is : @xmath102 the characteristic timescale of decay , set by a neighbour at @xmath99 is found from equation eq .",
    "[ dff ] to be @xmath103    the coherence is constructed as an average over many configurations of donor positions ( eq .  [ clusters ] ) and we can use the above to convert the exponential probability in eq.[exp ] from @xmath99 into a temporal form @xmath104 . if there is a nearest neighbour at distance @xmath99 then the coherence survives for a time @xmath105 as given above .",
    "we consider the regime where @xmath106 thus where resonant spins flip - flop freely while all other channels are damped .",
    "taking then @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the density of resonant donor spins ( only 10@xmath109 of the spins are resonant with the central spin ) we obtain the coherence decay at ct in this regime @xmath110 with : @xmath111    for @xmath112 , this yields @xmath113 ms at the ct , in very good agreement with the cluster calculations , but about a factor of @xmath114 shorter than the measured value . since @xmath22 ^ 2/[\\frac{1}{2}(1+p_u(b_\\text{ct}))(1-p_d(b_\\text{ct}))]$ ] , we also obtain @xmath115 ms at high fields , at this density , in good agreement with standard expressions for instantaneous diffusion .",
    "an important question is whether highly enriched 50 ppm @xmath2si samples in @xcite are above or below the @xmath106 regime or whether non - resonant spins contribute apprecialy .",
    "a simulation for @xmath112 indicates that the @xmath2si dominate overhauser fields with a lorentzian @xmath30 distribution of width @xmath116khz , thus @xmath117 hz , even including a contribution from other donors .",
    "fig.[fig2](b ) indicates that there is still a large , even dominant contribution from non - resonant spins .",
    "proximate @xmath2si nuclei ( within tens of angstroms of the central spin ) would provide a strong enough perturbation @xmath118 khz to damp flip - flops of resonant states at cts ; but for enriched samples , they will affect only a very small proportion of donors .",
    "given the modest overhauser fields present in current experiments , we conclude that decoherence at clock transitions includes a very substantial contribution from direct flip - flops with non - resonant spins .",
    "we have shown that quantum bath calculations can not account for measured electronic spin coherence @xmath0 times at clock transitions if only detuning fields of magnetic origin are included and so much of the enhancement found over the high field limit is due to non - magnetic detunings of unknown origin . despite these uncertainties , some robust conclusions are still possible . were it not for non - magnetic detunings , the coherence times at cts could be about an order of magnitude shorter and enhancements over the high field limit would be modest .",
    "the study identifies a regime where non - resonant flip - flops are fully suppressed but where , because of the ct , resonant spins ( not detuned by non - magnetic fields ) are fully released from the overhauser field . here",
    "they may interact and entangle via the dipolar interaction , but may also be selectively detuned , if required , by electric fields .",
    "we identify also dipolar refocusing points where in future , if qubit detunings and state preparation is possible , the full dipolar interaction can be eliminated by a simple hahn echo sequence of arbitrary pulse spacing .",
