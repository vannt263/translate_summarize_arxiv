    "continuous time random walks ( ctrws ) ( @xcite , @xcite ) are models describing the motion of individual particles ( or any other conserved quantity ) probabilistically . since their introduction they have found many applications in physics , among other reasons , due to the fact that they allow exploring possibilities which go beyond the classical paradigm of diffusive transport .",
    "their simplest realization , known as a separable ctrw , is defined in terms of two probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) : the step - size pdf , @xmath0 , and the waiting - time pdf , @xmath1 .",
    "it is well - known that when the step - size pdf is gaussian and the waiting - time pdf is exponential , the fluid limit ( in which only long - time , large - distance information is retained ) yields diffusive equations .",
    "these choices intrinsically imply the existence of finite characteristic length and time scales associated to the underlying microscopic transport mechanism .",
    "however , there is a large number of physical , biological and social systems  @xcite in which the dominant transport mechanism lacks either a well - defined characteristic length scale or a well - defined characteristic timescale or both . instead , the characteristic transport scales diverge with the system size and/or lifespan . for instance",
    ", this happens whenever transport takes place via avalanches .",
    "transport events as a result have a maximum size that is only limited by the system size @xmath2 , and a characteristic size that diverges with some power of @xmath2 .",
    "this situation has been encountered , to list just a few examples , while investigating the transport of both particles and energy out of magnetically - confined fusion plasmas  @xcite , in the propagation of forest fires  @xcite , earthquakes  @xcite , solar flares  @xcite and the transport of magnetic vortices in type - ii superconductors  @xcite .",
    "it is possible to construct ctrw models that lack characteristic scales by choosing @xmath0 and @xmath1 from the family of stable lvy distributions  @xcite .",
    "the fluid limit is then expressed in terms of transport equations that contain fractional differential operators  @xcite , which are essentially non - local and non - markovian .",
    "there is evidence , both numerical and experimental , that models generated in this manner provide a reasonably effective description of transport for some of the aforementioned problems  @xcite .",
    "although the formulation of ctrw models in finite systems is straightforward  @xcite , their fluid limit equations and associated propagators are much harder to obtain than in infinite domains . in this work we will study the formulation of ctrws on a finite one - dimensional system with periodic boundary conditions ( the unit circle ) and work out its fluid limit in a rigorous way for an arbitrary stable lvy distribution .",
    "we envision that the formalism introduced in this paper might find application in systems in which particles or energy are amenable to trapping and/or avalanching processes along a periodic direction",
    ". a possible example might be the investigation of heat transport in single - wall carbon nanotube ( swnt ) nanorings , which have gained recent attention due to their interesting transport properties  @xcite , such as aharonov - bohm effects , magnetotransport or establishment of persistent currents .",
    "some molecular dynamical simulations have found that linear swnts seem to exhibit heat conductivities divergent with the nanotube length , which suggests that a characteristic length scale might be lacking  @xcite .",
    "if these observations apply to nanorings as well , the periodic ctrw here presented might provide an adequate model for their effective description .",
    "other possible applications might be to the modeling of some types of transport in turbulent plasmas confined in a ( multi-)periodic system , such as those found in the ( quasi - spherical ) sun or in earth - based ( toroidal ) magnetic confinement devices with interest for fusion energy production  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : ctrwpergme ] we derive the generalized master equation ( gme ) for a time - translational invariant , separable ctrw on the circle . in section [ sec : fluidlimit ] we work out the fluid limit of such family of ctrws introducing , in particular , the appropriate form of the riemann - liouville operators on the circle .",
    "the computation of the propagator of the fluid limit equations in the homogeneous case is presented in section [ sec : propagator ] .",
    "we discuss its asymptotic behaviour and give analytical solutions for @xmath3 in the markovian case .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "finally , [ sec : applevy ] and [ sec : fdorealine ] give a brief survey on stable lvy distributions and fractional calculus , respectively .",
    "we consider that the dynamics takes place on the unit circle , @xmath4 , parameterized by @xmath5 .",
    "sometimes it is useful to view the unit circle as @xmath6 , where the quotient is taken with respect to the equivalence relation @xmath7 for any @xmath8 .",
    "functions on @xmath4 can then be identified with the set of periodic functions on @xmath9 with period @xmath10 .",
    "explicitly , given @xmath11 , its extension to a periodic function on @xmath9 is @xmath12 { } & x & \\mapsto & f([x ] ) , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 $ ] is the ( unique ) representative of the equivalence class of @xmath14 which belongs to @xmath15 . obviously ,",
    "if @xmath16 , @xmath17 . finally , every function @xmath18 considered in this paper is assumed to have a fourier series expansion , @xmath19 with coefficients given by the formula : @xmath20    as mentioned above , we restrict ourselves to the case of separable ctrws with time - translational invariance .",
    "this means that the ctrw is defined by two pdfs , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , called the _ step - size _ pdf and the _ waiting - time _ pdf , respectively . here , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath0 gives the probability that a particle located at @xmath26 jumps to @xmath27 after having waited at @xmath26 for a lapse of time @xmath28 .",
    "since @xmath29 is unbounded , this may imply an arbitrary number of turns around the circle .",
    "finally , @xmath0 and @xmath1 verify the normalization conditions , @xmath30 & & \\int_0^\\infty\\psi(\\tau,\\theta){\\mbox{d}}\\tau = 1 , \\",
    "\\forall\\theta\\in [ 0,2\\pi).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we denote by @xmath31 the density of particles normalized to the total number of particles , i.e. @xmath32 .",
    "the gme for the time evolution of @xmath31 corresponding to this class of ctrws can be derived as follows  @xcite .",
    "first , note that the normalized density of particles is equal to the probability of finding one particle at @xmath26 at time @xmath33 .",
    "this probability can be rewritten as : @xmath34 where @xmath35 gives the probability that the walker arrives at @xmath26 at time @xmath36 , and @xmath37 gives the probability of staying at @xmath26 for a lapse of time @xmath28 .",
    "clearly , one has : @xmath38 then , we rewrite : @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the probability that a single walker arrives at @xmath26 at time @xmath33 by performing exactly @xmath41 jumps . obviously , for an arbitrary ctrw the function @xmath40 satisfies the following recurrence relation : @xmath42 where the sum in front of the integral explicitly accounts for the fact that particles can arrive at @xmath26 from @xmath43 through jumps of length @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath46 provides the needed initial condition .",
    "adding over all possible values of @xmath41 , we find an equation for @xmath47 : @xmath48    we proceed now to carry out the previously described periodic extension to the real line .",
    "trivially , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 also satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eq : qj1 ] ) . in @xmath9",
    ", we can make the change of variables @xmath52 and use the periodicity properties of @xmath49 , @xmath53 and @xmath51 , together with the additivity of the integral with respect to the interval of integration , and convert eq .",
    "( [ eq : qj1 ] ) into : @xmath54 this equation is formally identical to eq .  ( 12 ) from ref .",
    "@xcite , which appears in the derivation of the gme in an infinite system .",
    "the main difference is that @xmath55 , whilst positive , is no longer a probability density in @xmath9 , since as a periodic function it is no longer integrable .",
    "this does not invalidate the procedure , because the convolution theorem still applies .",
    "consequently , we can take the final result : eq .",
    "( 24 ) of ref .",
    "namely , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is also a periodic function defined by : @xmath58}{{\\cal l}[\\breve\\eta(\\theta , t)]}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath59 $ ] stands for the laplace transform with respect to @xmath33 .",
    "again , @xmath60 is not a probability density function in @xmath9 even when positive because it is periodic and thus non - integrable .",
    "we need to restrict the integrals to @xmath15 to recover the probabilistic interpretation .",
    "to do so , we simply reverse the manipulations which led us from ( [ eq : qj1 ] ) to ( [ eq : qj2 ] ) , recasting the gme ( [ eq : gmeinf ] ) as @xmath61 with @xmath62 from this expression it is obvious that @xmath63 is positive - definite and periodic in its first argument , @xmath64 , for any @xmath43 .",
    "furthermore , the normalization of @xmath0 in @xmath9 implies the normalization of @xmath63 in @xmath4 , @xmath65 so that @xmath63 is a probability distribution on the circle .",
    "hence , the gme ( [ eq : gmeper ] ) is written in terms of functions on @xmath4 and makes manifest that the dynamics of @xmath31 is well - defined on the circle .",
    "it is worth pointing out that ( [ eq : barp ] ) expresses the fact that particles can wind around the circle an arbitrary number of times , and hence is a consequence of the non - trivial topology of the manifold on which the ctrw takes place .",
    "actually , @xmath63 shows up as the effective step - size pdf on the circle and is related to the original step - size pdf , @xmath0 , through ( [ eq : barp ] ) .",
    "this relation is in fact the _ ballooning transform _ that was introduced in the plasma physics literature in the late 70s to deal with pdes formulated on toroidal geometries  @xcite",
    "[ fig : compare_gauss ] and [ fig : compare_cauchy ] compare @xmath0 and @xmath63 when @xmath0 is a gaussian and a cauchy distribution ( see [ sec : applevy ] ) , respectively . as expected , the effect of topology is much more relevant for lvy distributions with algebraic tails than for the gaussian .",
    "since we will be especially interested in the fluid limit of the ctrw when @xmath0 and/or @xmath1 are lvy distributions ( which only have a finite number of finite integer moments ) , we can not carry out the calculation by the standard method of expanding the gme using moments of these distributions .",
    "the appropriate procedure involves going to the fourier ( for space ) and laplace ( for time ) domains .",
    "the fluid limit , which implies retaining only the dynamical information pertaining to the longer times and larger distances , corresponds to taking the limits @xmath66 , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 stand respectively for the fourier and laplace variables .",
    "since @xmath63 is periodic with period @xmath10 , we can expand it in a fourier series with respect to its first argument : @xmath69 recalling the definition of @xmath63 in terms of @xmath0 , the coefficients of this expansion are : @xmath70 where in the third equality we have performed the change of variables @xmath71 and in the fourth equality we have used that @xmath72 .",
    "hence , the @xmath73-th coefficient in the fourier expansion of @xmath63 with respect to its first argument is exactly the value of the fourier transform of @xmath0 with respect to its first argument at @xmath74 .",
    "this relation is characteristic of the aforementioned ballooning transform  @xcite .    following ref .",
    "@xcite , we proceed by inserting this expansion in ( [ eq : gmeper ] ) , @xmath75 now , we expand both sides in fourier series with respect to @xmath26 and equate coefficients , @xmath76 since @xmath77 and @xmath78 we obtain : @xmath79    let @xmath80 be the characteristic exponent of @xmath21 , i.e. @xmath81 . the fluid limit is defined by taking @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , eq .  ( [ eq : gmeperfourierinhom ] ) in the fluid limit is written as @xmath83    at this point we need to make choices for the step - size and waiting - time pdfs .",
    "a natural choice is to take stable lvy distributions , which satisfy the central limit theorem  @xcite .",
    "thus , following ref .",
    "@xcite , we will assume first that the waiting - time pdf is a positive extremal lvy distribution ( see appendix a ) . performing a ( non - analytic , in general ) expansion of the laplace transform of @xmath1 around @xmath84 and keeping the lowest order terms : @xmath85,\\ ] ] where @xmath86 if @xmath87 and @xmath88 if @xmath89 , which corresponds to an exponential waiting - time pdf .",
    "the convolution in the second integral of ( [ eq : gmeperfourierinhomfl ] ) in the fluid limit yields : @xmath90\\approx a_\\gamma\\tau^{-\\gamma}s^{1-\\gamma}\\tilde n(\\theta',s)\\ ] ] where we have made use of ( [ eq : levyextremallaplace ] ) .",
    "then , eq .  ( [ eq : gmeperfourierinhomfl ] ) in laplace space reads : @xmath91 now , multiplying both sides by @xmath92 , using ( [ eq : caputo ] ) and ( [ eq : caputolaplace ] ) and laplace inverting : @xmath93    as for the spatial part , we will consider the case in which @xmath80 is the characteristic exponent of a general lvy distribution ( see [ sec : applevy ] ) with parameters dependent on @xmath26 : @xmath94+i\\mu(\\theta)k & \\hspace{0.4cm}\\alpha\\in(0,1)\\cup(1,2],\\\\[8pt ] \\hspace{-5.2cm}-\\sigma(\\theta)|k|+i\\mu(\\theta ) k & \\hspace{-1.6cm}\\alpha = 1 , \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] restricting ourselves to @xmath95 for @xmath96 .",

    "given a symmetric lvy distribution ( @xmath145 ) , it is well - known that the fluid limit propagator in an infinite , homogeneous system is invariant under rescaling of the so - called _ self - similarity variable _ , @xmath146 , and the propagator ( with initial condition localized at the origin ) at @xmath147 decays as @xmath148 .",
    "things work quite differently in a periodic system , in which the notion of self - similiarity does not make sense . for the time evolution of the propagator on the circle ( @xmath145 ) at @xmath149 , @xmath150 ,",

    "then , @xmath161 and we can give a closed expression for the propagator : @xmath162 it is instructive to work out the approximate form of the propagator for small @xmath33 and in the vicinity of @xmath149 directly from eq .",

    "although there are numerous results concerning ctrws in infinite systems , much work still remains to be done on their finite - size formulation . in this paper",
    "we have performed a detailed study of time translationally invariant , spatially inhomogeneous , separable ctrws on the circle , in order to investigate how the topology can affect the form of the generalized master equation and the corresponding fluid limit equations .",
    "we have found that , in order to formulate the ctrw on the circle , a non - trivial transformation of the step - size pdf must be carried out which is strongly reminiscent of the ballooning transform familiar to plasma physicists . during the derivation of the fluid limit of these periodic ctrws , it was shown that the standard riemann - liouville operators need to be reformulated on the circle .",
