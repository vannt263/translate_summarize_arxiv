    "longitudinal dipole excitations in quantum dots ( qd s ) under applied magnetic fields have been observed in photo - absorption experiments in the far infra - red region,@xcite and more recently in raman scattering experiments.@xcite these modes are excited by the dipole operator @xmath0 , and the resonance frequencies in the magneto - optical absorption spectrum of a qd with asymmetric parabolic confinement potential are found to be independent of the electron - electron interaction and of the number of electrons in the dot , and they coincide with the single - electron transition frequencies .",
    "this statement , known as the generalized kohn theorem , was demonstrated some years ago by peeters@xcite for a two - dimensional qd under an external magnetic field ( @xmath1 ) perpendicular to the plane of motion of the electrons .",

    "differently from the density channel , in the spin channel all the strength is mainly concentrated in one collective low energy mode .",
    "the peak energy is lower in the spin than in the density channel .",
    "this is due to the character of the tdlsda particle - hole residual interaction , which is attractive but weak in the spin channel , and repulsive and rather strong in the density channel , shifting the tdlsda response from the single - particle one in opposite directions.@xcite increasing the value of @xmath1 , the spin mode becomes progressively softer .",
    "the tdlsda predicts the existence of a spin instability when the energy of the spin mode goes to zero at some critical @xmath1 value@xcite .",
    "a spin mode with this feature has been observed in gaas quantum dots@xcite using raman spectroscopy , as well as in quantum wells@xcite in a perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "in particular , in the quantum well experiment , evidence for the spin instability at some values of electron density and @xmath1 has been reported.@xcite the agreement between our calculation and the experimental findings of schller et al . in qd s is qualitatively good for low @xmath1 values ( see also ref . ) .",
    "the lack of experimental observation of collective spin states at larger @xmath1 values might be considered the signature of the above mentioned instabilities .",
    "however , it can not be excluded that landau damping , which in this energy range is particularly strong , prevents its experimental observation .",
    "besides , correlations beyond tdlsda which are important for non - integer filling factors , might also quench the spin mode .",
    "the dipole and spin dipole responses of a 3d quantum dot in a magnetic field of arbitray direction have been analyzed by means of real time simulations within tdlsda .",
    "the fragmetation of the strength due to the non circular shape of the qd and to the @xmath25 angle between the magnetic field @xmath31 and the axis perpendicular to the plane of motion of the electrons has been studied .",
    "the density dipole strengths splits in three collective states which are exactly found at the energies predicted by the generalized kohn theorem . by changing the values of @xmath25 and of @xmath1",
    ", some strength moves from one state to another in a way which could be easily detected .",
    "the spin dipole strength is mainly exhausted by a single , soft collective mode whose energy goes to zero as @xmath1 increases , and as the direction of the applied magnetic field goes from perpendicular to parallel to the plane containing the dot .",
    "for some values of @xmath31 , tdlsda predicts spin instabilities similar to these observed in raman spectroscopy experiments .    a key result from our study is the circumstantial evidence that it is possible to develop a 3d code implementing tdlsda with a magnetic field in an arbitrary direction with very high accuracy .",
    "this opens the possibility of addressing the far - infrared response of more complicated systems , such as double qds@xcite or quantum rings vertically coupled , whose description using the density - density or spin - density correlation functions@xcite is prohibitive .",
