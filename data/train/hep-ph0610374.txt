    "recent lattice qcd simulations suggest the existence of such excitations in the heavy quark sector @xcite . in the light quark sector , it is theoretically predicted that there exist light collective modes in the sigma- and pi - channels , as the soft modes of the chiral phase transition @xcite .",

    ", the thermal mass does not break the chiral symmetry .",
    "although the validity of the htl approximation may be violated around @xmath2 , lattice simulations suggest a large quark mass near but above @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "if the quarks have large thermal masses near @xmath2 , they can affect the properties of mesonic excitations , especially in the light quark sector @xcite , and also the chiral transition at finite temperature .",

    "we explore the effects of the thermal mass on the chiral phase transition and mesonic excitations at finite temperature in a simple model .",
    "we employ the propagator obtained in the htl approximation for the quarks , with the thermal mass @xmath0 introduced as a parameter .",
    "we also adopt a chirally - symmetric four - fermi interaction in the scalar and pseudoscalar channels . using this model ,",
    "we show that the order of the chiral transition does not change , while the value of the chiral condensate is suppressed , when @xmath6 is included .",
    "it will be shown that even at finite @xmath0 , there are soft modes of the chiral transition in the scalar and pseudoscalar channels @xcite . using these modes , we study the effect of @xmath0 on the mesonic excitations above @xmath2",
    ".    how does the thermal mass of the quark affect the properties of mesonic excitations ?",
    "naively , a mesonic excitation below the expected threshold energy , @xmath7 , is tightly bounded , since the decay process into quark and anti - quark is forbidden below @xmath8 .",
    "we show in the present work , however , that the effect of the thermal mass is completely contrary to this statement ; if the quark has the spectrum calculated in the htl approximation with a thermal mass @xmath0 , the decay rate of the mesonic excitations is enhanced below the energy @xmath1 .",
    "it is discussed that these decay rates mainly originate from the continuum in the quark spectrum which physically corresponds to the landau damping of the quasi - quarks .",

    "before we present the model employed , let us first briefly review the property of the quark propagator in the high temperature limit of qcd , in order to see the emergence of the gapped collective excitations in the quark spectra . in this limit , the retarded quark propagator is calculated by the htl approximation as @xmath9^{-1 } , \\label{eq : s}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the quark self - energy in the one - loop level with @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite .",

    "since the excitation spectra @xmath26 becomes @xmath0 at @xmath27 , @xmath0 is called the thermal mass . the spectral functions eq .",

    "it is therefore plausible that the quarks have large thermal masses in the non - perturbative region near @xmath2 .",
