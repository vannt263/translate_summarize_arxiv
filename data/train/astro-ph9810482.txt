    "since the pioneer studies on the cosmological nature of quasar redshifts ( eg .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) several works have provided useful insights on the environment of quasars such as the recent works of @xcite and @xcite . at low redshifts , @xmath3",
    ", recent results suggest that quasars are placed in similar environments to galaxies ( @xcite ) , or in groups of 10 - 20 galaxies ( @xcite ) . in this respect at high redshifts , @xmath4 ,",
    "the evidence of different environments for radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars is compelling ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "radio - loud quasars are mainly associated with rich abell clusters and radio - quiet quasars reside either in groups or in the outskirts of clusters .",
    "it should be noted that due to the lack of suitable low redshift quasar samples the majority of observational works concern intermediate redshifts , @xmath5 .    on the theoretical side the discussion of the influence of quasar activity on the formation and evolution of nearby galaxies has been present during the last decades .",
    "the surrounding galaxy environment would be responsible for triggering and fueling the quasars as first suggested by @xcite , where interacting galaxies and mergers are efficient at transporting gas into the inner regions of the host galaxy .",
    "the evolution of the rate of galaxy interactions in clusters would allow an understanding of the observed clustering of galaxies around radio - loud quasars ( @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , the large range of influence of a quasar may have implications for structure formation . according to @xcite and",
    "@xcite quasars may ionize the surrounding medium up to several megaparsecs away .",
    "a different approach is adopted by other authors ( see for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , where a fraction of the energy released by quasars is transferred via energetic outflows to the gaseous medium .    in order to shed some light on this subject we have computed the angular and projected cross - correlation function of target quasars and agns from the @xcite catalog , and galaxy tracers from the edinburgh - durham galaxy catalog ( @xcite ) . we have also explored the possible astrophysical effects of quasar activity by means of hydrodynamical cosmological numerical simulations which take into account momentum transfer to the gas at the time of maximum quasar activity . as an attempt to model these effects",
    "we have considered here a simple scheme following the model of @xcite .",
    "quasar - galaxy association in the models are quantified by computing the spatial quasar - galaxy cross - correlation function and we derive the projected cross - correlations which may be compared to observations .",
    "our target sample consists of quasars and agns selected from the @xcite catalog , hereafter vcv , which comprises angular positions , redshifts , and photometric data for 11,358 quasars and 3,334 agns and provides the most recent compilation of quasars and agns .",
    "the edinburgh - durham southern galaxy catalog , hereafter cosmos survey ( @xcite ) , was used as a suitable tracer of the galaxy distribution .",
    "this survey provides angular positions and photographic magnitudes in the @xmath6 band for over two million galaxies .",
    "we have restricted our study to the region @xmath7 given the lower quality in the photographic material in the northern hemisphere .",
    "we adopt a limiting apparent magnitude @xmath8 as a compromise between plate quality and depth .",
    "we have estimated the galaxy redshift distribution function for different apparent limiting magnitudes as derived by @xcite ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "taking into account these results we have adopted a target redshift cutoff @xmath9 since the fraction of cosmos galaxies beyond this redshift is less than @xmath10 for limiting magnitude @xmath8 .",
    "we have excluded from our analysis targets with @xmath11 .",
    "this avoids a few nearby objects for which fixed projected spatial bins correspond to very large angular areas dominating projected correlations . with the above restrictions the resulting sample of targets consists in 103 quasars and 226 agns in the region @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "the tracer sample comprises 1,982,847 galaxies brighter than @xmath8 in the same area .",
    "our analysis consists of the computation of the mean excess with respect to the average number density of cosmos galaxies as a function of angular separation @xmath15 ) , and projected distance ( @xmath16 ) from vcv targets .",
    "@xmath17    @xmath18    @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the mean number of target - galaxy pairs ( vcv - cosmos ) and random - galaxy pairs ( random - cosmos ) at angular separation @xmath23 and projected separation @xmath24 respectively .",
    "we have considered cross - correlations for @xmath25 and @xmath26 to exclude the cross - correlation with the host galaxy . in order to directly compare the results of quasars and agns",
    "we have restricted the redshift distribution of agns to fit that of quasars .",
    "this new restricted sample of agns has 116 objects and was obtained by imposing to the original agns sample a radial gradient through a monte - carlo rejection algorithm that provides a similar redshift distribution to quasars . therefore , both angular and projected cross - correlation functions can be directly compared . in figure 1",
    "we show the corresponding redshift distributions of galaxies with @xmath27 ( @xcite ) , quasars , agns , and restricted agns . as can be seen , in this figure a negligible fraction of cosmos galaxies",
    "are expected beyond our limiting redshift @xmath28 .",
    "the different redshift distributions of quasars and agns and the similar redshift distributions of quasars and restricted agns can also be appreciated .    in figures 2 to 5",
    "are shown the resulting angular and projected correlation for quasars @xmath29 and the restricted agn sample @xmath30 , both with cosmos tracers at limiting magnitude @xmath31 . in these figures error",
    "bars correspond to uncertainties derived from the bootstrap resampling technique developed by @xcite with 20 bootstrap target samples .",
    "figure 2 shows a lack of strong quasar - galaxy angular correlations @xmath32 , consistent with the results derived by @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the agn - tracer angular cross - correlation function @xmath33 as shown in figure 3 is consistent with a power - law with significant correlation signal for @xmath34 .",
    "as can be seen in figure 4 the quasar - tracer projected cross - correlation function @xmath35 shows a statistically significant positive signal for quasar - tracer projected separations in the range @xmath1 . on smaller scales , @xmath36",
    ", there is a marked decrease of the correlation amplitude which makes @xmath37 .",
    "this behavior contrasts with the smooth power - law trend of @xmath38 shown in figure 5 for the restricted sample of agn targets .",
    "thus , a significant difference in the environment of quasars and active galaxies is implied by our analysis .",
    "while the latter show a correlation function similar to that of the general galaxy population , the projected quasar - galaxy correlation function , @xmath39 , indicates a significant departure from a power law at small scales .    by comparing the projected correlation functions",
    "@xmath39 and @xmath40 it can be seen their similar correlation amplitude on scales @xmath41 .",
    "this result indicates that quasars and agns reside in similar global galaxy density enhancements and suggesting that the effective influence of quasars on galaxy formation is restricted to scales @xmath42 .",
    "in an attempt to analyze the influence of quasars on environment we have performed numerical simulations using the hydra code , developed and kindly made available by h. couchman .",
    "initial positions and velocities of particles were generated using the zeldovich approximation corresponding to the cdm power spectrum .",
    "we have adopted two different values of the density parameter @xmath43 and @xmath44 both with baryonic density parameter @xmath45 .",
    "simulations corresponding to @xmath46 model were normalized according to cosmic background temperature fluctuations as determined by measurements of the cobe satellite , which implies present rms mass fluctuation in a @xmath47 sphere radius @xmath48 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have taken the same @xmath49 value for the @xmath43 model in order to make them of comparable present mass density fluctuations and to emphasize the dependence of the results on the ratio of baryonic - to - total density .",
    "the computational volume corresponds to a periodic cube of side length @xmath50 measured at @xmath51 .",
    "we have followed the evolution of @xmath52 particles for the two cdm models adopted , @xmath44 and @xmath43 with the same value of the hubble constant ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "the mass of the gas and the dark matter particles are @xmath54 and @xmath55 respectively for the @xmath44 model and @xmath54 and @xmath56 for the @xmath43 model .",
    "we use an analytic fit to the cdm power spectrum of the form    @xmath57^{1/2 } } \\left ( \\frac{\\ln(1 + 2.34q)}{2.34/q } \\right ) ^{2}\\ ] ]    where @xmath58 mpc @xmath59 , @xmath60 exp ( -@xmath61 and @xmath62 is the value of the baryon density parameter imposed by nucleosynthesis theory ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the initial conditions correspond to redshift @xmath63 and the evolution was followed using a variable time - step resulting typical runs of 1000 steps .",
    "we have adopted the start of quasar activity in the models at @xmath64 which coincides approximately with the redshift of observed maximum abundance of quasars . at this redshift , we identify local mass density maxima and associate the quasar with the highest density particle .    in order to analyze the effects of quasar energetics on galaxy formation we have applied a simple scheme following the model developed by @xcite in hydrodynamical numerical simulations . in this plain scheme",
    "it is assumed that a fraction ( @xmath65 ) of the total energy input by a quasar ( @xmath66 ) is in the form of momentum transfer to the surrounding gas .",
    "this is accomplished by increasing the radial component of the velocities of gas particles within a given radius at @xmath64 where we assume one quasar becomes active in each simulation . according to @xcite ( see also @xcite ) this increase of radial velocities amounts to @xmath67 for particles within a sphere of radius @xmath68 . here",
    ", @xmath69 refers to the total energy in units of @xmath70 emitted by the quasar in its lifetime ( @xmath71 ) , and @xmath72 is the baryonic density parameter in units of 0.05 .",
    "the quasar position is chosen to coincide with the highest gas density particle in the simulations .",
    "it should be recalled that the simulated box is not typical regarding the number density of quasars since to match observed quasar abundance estimates only 1 out of @xmath73 such boxes should have a quasar .",
    "our rather small box size adopted is mainly to improve the numerical resolution of the simulations .    using a standard friends - of - friends algorithm we define gaseous clumps that should be associated to galactic halos in the simulations .",
    "each given initial condition is evolved with and without quasar activity .",
    "we take advantage of the identical initial conditions for each pair of simulations for a suitable analysis of the environmental effects of quasars .",
    "we compute the spatial quasar - galaxy correlation function in the set of simulations with quasar energy release and we compare the quasar - galaxy cross - correlation function with the galaxy - galaxy correlation functions of the set of simulations without quasars .",
    "for the latter , the centers of the galaxy - galaxy correlations correspond to the maximum gas density particles that defined the quasars at @xmath64 in the former .",
    "the resulting spatial quasar - galaxy correlation function @xmath74 corresponding to 20 pairs of simulations are shown in figures 6 and 7 ( @xmath75 and @xmath76 respectively ) which display the strong suppression of galaxy formation in the neighborhood of the quasars ( @xmath77 ) consistent with no correlation at these scales , and a maximum in @xmath74 at @xmath78 since the power - law behavior at larger scales is not affected by the model .",
    "for comparison , in these figures is also shown the spatial galaxy - galaxy correlation function with center galaxies defined in the previous paragraph . in both figures ,",
    "errorbars correspond to poisson estimates , @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the number of galaxies in each bin and @xmath81 is the expected number in a uniform distribution .    comparing the spatial correlation functions of the models a stronger galaxy suppression at small scales",
    "is seen in the lower density ( @xmath75 ) model .",
    "this is due to the higher relative fraction of baryons which are affected by the momentum transfer in this case . in the @xmath46 model",
    "the dark matter is dominant by a factor 3 allowing the retention of more gas in the quasar neighborhood than in the low density models .    in figures 8 and 9 ,",
    "we show the projected quasar - galaxy correlation function of the models @xmath16 . in the small angle approximation @xmath39",
    "is related to the spatial correlation function @xmath74 by :    @xmath82    with @xmath83 is a normalization constant which includes the probability @xmath84 that a tracer galaxy is at distance @xmath85 , and @xmath86 is the distance to the @xmath87 quasar . we have used a schechter function fit ( @xcite ) to the luminosity function of cosmos tracer galaxies , with parameters @xmath88 , @xmath89 , a flat cosmology , and a linear @xmath90-correction term @xmath91 .",
    "the model projected quasar - galaxy correlation function on scales @xmath92 has a similar behavior than the observed cross - correlation . by inversion of equation 4",
    "using the observed @xmath39 we derive negative values of the spatial cross - correlation function @xmath74 on these scales , which stress the relevance of this observational effect .",
    "the simplicity of our adopted scheme of energy release of quasars , the small size of the simulated box and the restricted dynamical range impose further limitations on the models .",
    "considering these shortcomings , we conclude that the results of the models analyzed reasonably reproduce the observations .",
    "the quasar - galaxy projected cross - correlation function @xmath93 shows a maximum at @xmath94 and is consistent with no correlation for @xmath95 .",
    "the inversion of such a projected correlation function requires a negative spatial correlation on scales @xmath96 indicating strong effects of quasars in their local environment .",
    "the corresponding angular cross - correlations are roughly consistent with no signal detection .",
    "in contrast to the behavior of quasar - tracer correlations , we find that both angular and projected agn - galaxy cross - correlation functions are consistent with the usual power - law shape .",
    "the agreement of @xmath39 and @xmath40 at scales @xmath97 , suggests that both quasars and agns reside in similar global galaxy enhancements .",
    "the analysis of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations allows us to study the effects of energy input by the quasars to the surrounding gaseous medium .",
    "the model developed by @xcite considers a typical energy input of @xmath98 to the gas which develops a shell of present radius @xmath99 originally at a speed of @xmath100 .",
    "the implementation of this scheme in our numerical simulations shows that a relative lack of galaxies in the neighborhood of quasars may arise naturally in these models providing support to the viability of this scenario .",
