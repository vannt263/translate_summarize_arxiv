    "autoresonance ( ar ) is a generic nonlinear phase - locking phenomenon in classical dynamics .",
    "it yields a robust approach to excitation and control of nonlinear oscillatory systems by a continuous self - adjustment of systems parameters to maintain the resonance with chirped frequency perturbations .",
    "applications of ar exist in many fields of physics , examples being atomic and molecular systems @xcite , nonlinear optics segev , josephson junctions @xcite , hydrodynamics bendavid , plasmas @xcite , nonlinear waves @xcite , and quantum wells @xcite .",
    "most recently , ar served as an essential element in the formation of trapped anti - hydrogen atoms at cern @xcite and in studying the effect of fluctuations in driven josephson junctions @xcite .",
    "while the classical ar is well understood , the investigation of the quantum - mechanical limits of the problem has started only recently @xcite .",
    "the present study focuses on the interrelation between the classical and quantum descriptions of the autoresonant transition in the simplest case of a driven duffing oscillator ( modeling a driven diatomic molecule @xcite or a josephson junction @xcite , for example ) governed by the hamiltonian    @xmath9    where @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the chirped driving frequency and @xmath12 .",
    "we will assume that initially our oscillator is in a thermal equilibrium with the environment at temperature @xmath13 , but the chirped system s response is sufficiently fast to neglect the effect of the environment on the out - of - equilibrium dynamics @xcite .",
    "classically , in autoresonance , after passage through the linear resonance at @xmath14 , the driven oscillator gradually self - adjusts its oscillation frequency to that of the drive by continuously increasing its energy fajans , yielding a convenient control of the dynamics by variation of an external parameter ( the driving frequency ) .",
    "the transition to the classical ar by passage through linear resonance has a threshold on the driving amplitude , scaling as @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "this threshold is sharp if the oscillator starts in its zero equilibrium , but in the presence of thermal noise it develops a width , scaling as @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "both the ar threshold and its width have their quantum - mechanical counterparts , which will be discussed in this work .",
    "when the problem of autoresonant transition is dealt with quantum - mechanically , two questions must be addressed .",
    "first , what are the differences between the classical and quantum evolutions of the chirped - driven nonlinear oscillator ? in dealing with this question , ref .",
    "@xcite suggested that the natural quantum - mechanical limit of the classical ar is a series of successive landau - zener ( lz ) @xcite transitions or energy ladder climbing ( lc ) , where only two adjacent energy levels of the driven oscillator are coupled at any given time .",
    "in contrast , the classical ar behavior takes place when many levels are coupled at all times during the excitation @xcite .",
    "we will adopt and further develop this point of view here and describe different regimes in the problem in terms of two dimensionless parameters @xmath17suggested in gilad .",
    "these parameters are defined via the three physical time - scales in the system , i.e. the inverse rabi frequency @xmath18 , the frequency sweep time scale @xmath19 , and the characteristic nonlinearity time scale @xmath20 ( the time of passage through the nonlinear frequency shift between the first two transitions on the energy ladder ) .",
    "then , by definition    @xmath21    ( this parameter measures the strength of the drive ) , and    @xmath22    ( a measure of the nonlinearity in the problem ) .",
    "we will show in this work that this parameter space describes all limiting cases of quantum - mechanical evolution in our system , including quantum initial conditions , the subsequent transition to either lc or ar , and the associated threshold phenomenon .",
    "note , that @xmath17have a meaning only in the case of a chirped system , because of the new time scale , @xmath23 , associated with this case .",
    "the second question , which must be addressed in the quantum - mechanical formulation of our problem is that of quantum fluctuations . as mentioned above , in the presence of thermal noise , the classical ar transition probability develops a width , scaling as @xmath16 with temperature prl",
    "nevertheless , at very low temperatures , the quantum fluctuations should be taken into account .",
    "recent experiments by kater et al .",
    "@xcite demonstrated quantum saturation of the width of the phase - locking transition in superconducting josephson junctions at sufficiently low temperatures , confirming the prediction that @xmath13 in the classical width formula @xcite should be replaced by an effective temperature , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 for high temperatures and saturates at @xmath26 at low temperatures .",
    "the experimental results imply that the fluctuations only determine the initial conditions of such a non - equilibrium oscillator and do not affect its time evolution . in this work",
    ", we will address the effect of quantum  fluctuations in the ar problem theoretically and provide further justification of using the classical ar threshold width formula with @xmath13 replaced by @xmath24 .",
    "the scope of the paper will be as follows . in sec . ii we will use the quantum - mechanical energy basis in the rotating wave approximation and compare the driven dynamics of our oscillator in the quantum and classical regimes numerically .",
    "section iii will present the analytic description of the transition to phase - locking in terms of the @xmath27 parameter space in both classical ar and quantum lc regimes .",
    "in the same section , the theory will be compared with numerical simulations .",
    "section iv will focus on the effect of quantum fluctuations on the width of the phase - locking transition .",
    "finally , we will address the phase space dynamics in the problem in sec .",
    "v by solving the quantum liouville equation for the wigner function numerically and compare the phase space evolution with that in the energy basis .",
    "our conclusions will be summarized in section vi .",
    "we write the wave function of the oscillator governed by eq.(eq : hamiltonian ) , @xmath28 , in the energy basis @xmath29 of the undriven ( @xmath30 ) hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "the associated schrodinger equation yields    @xmath31    where we approximate the energy levels @xcite    @xmath32    @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "we assume a weak coupling , @xmath36 , and , consequently , neglect the nonlinear correction of order @xmath37 in the coupling term .",

    "note , that @xmath7 characterizes the strength of the coupling between the adjacent levels , while @xmath50 is associated with the nonlinearity in the problem and determines the degree of classicality in the system ( see sec .",
    "note also that the rotating frame here is _ chirped _ instead of the usual , fixed frequency frame and , thus , there remains an explicit time dependence in eq .",
    "( [ eq : slow eq . ] ) .",
    "our goal is to analyze these slow evolution equations , but first , we discuss different limits in the driven system in @xmath27 parameter space .",
    "the comparison between the classical ar and the quantum lc regimes was first discussed by marcus et al .",
    "@xcite , who suggested the nonlinear resonance classicality criterion , @xmath51 , by requiring that the classical resonance width would include more than two quantum levels .",
    "since the chirp rate cancels from this creterion , the latter characterizes the nonlinear resonance phenomenon in the system driven by constant frequency drive as well .",
    "the chirping introduces a new effect , i.e. a possibility of a continuous self - adjustment of the energy of the oscillator to stay in resonance with the drive .",
    "this yields a new condition , separating the classical ar and quantum lc transitions , where the dynamics of the chirped system is very different . in the lc transition ,",
    "only two levels are coupled at a time and the system s wave function climbs the energy ladder by successive lz transitions @xcite .",
    "for example , eq .",
    "( [ eq : slow eq . ] ) yields the following two - level transformation matrix for the @xmath52 transition    @xmath53    we can calculate the time of the @xmath54 transition , @xmath55 by equating the diagonal elements in this matrix , i.e. @xmath56 , so the time interval between two successive transitions is @xmath57 . on the other hand ,",
    "the typical duration @xmath58 of each lz transition has two distinct limits @xcite . in the non adiabatic ( sudden )",
    "limit ( @xmath59 ) , @xmath58 is of the order of unity , while in the opposite ( adiabatic ) limit , @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , by comparing @xmath61 and @xmath58 , we expect to see well separated successive lz steps , i.e. the lc , provided @xmath62 which describes both the sudden and the adiabatic limits .",
    "in contrast , the classical ar transition requires @xmath6 , which coincides with the nonlinear resonance classicality criterion mentioned above , when @xmath63 . in section v , a different argument will be suggested to explain why classical mechanics yields the correct description of the transition to autoresonance when a stronger inequality , @xmath64 , is satisfied , even when the system starts in the quantum mechanical ground state .",
    "next , we discuss the numerical solutions of the problem and compare different regimes of chirped - driven dynamics .",
    "we have solved eqs .",

    "for example , we observe two groups of resonant and nonresonant levels at @xmath72 , separated by a valley centered at about @xmath73 .",
    "we find that the location of the resonant levels is determined by the slow time , i.e. @xmath74 , as shown above .",
    "thus , the resonant ( phase - locked ) state in the system is efficiently controlled via the driving frequency and a given final state can be reached ( and maintained ) by terminating the frequency chirp at the desired energy level .",
    "we also see that there exists a single highly occupied level in the resonant group of levels at any given time , indicating successive lz transitions , as expected in the lc regime .",
    "our second numerical example is presented in fig .",

    "[ flo : p2=8 ] , a clear separation between the resonant @xmath78 and nonresonant @xmath79 groups of levels is seen in the figure .",
    "we see that , typically , several levels are excited in the resonant group , but their number is small , so the driven dynamics can not be considered as classical .",
    "the last example ( see fig .",
    "[ flo : p2=0.2 ] ) corresponds to the classical regime , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "one observes a separation between resonant and nonresonant groups at @xmath83 .",
    "note that in all our numerical examples about 50% only of the initial state is transferred to the continuing phase - locked state , leading to the question of resonant capture probability , which is discussed next .",
    "for a given set @xmath84 we define the resonant capture probability ,    @xmath85    where @xmath86 is the number of the level separating the resonant and nonresonant groups of levels at sufficiently large times . for a given value of @xmath50 ,",

    "we calculate the resonant capture probability by solving eqs .",
    "( [ eq : slow eq . ] ) numerically subject to initial conditions , @xmath93 ( the ground state ) , for different values of @xmath27 and @xmath94 . for a fixed @xmath50 ,",
    "the capture probability @xmath87 is a monotonically increasing , smoothed step function of @xmath7 .",
    "we define the threshold for _ efficient _ phase - locking transition , @xmath95 , as the value of @xmath7 for 1/2 capture probability , i.e. @xmath96 . the full circles in fig .",

    "one can also see the oscillating pattern of the threshold @xmath95 at @xmath100 , where the transition to phase - locking involves a mixture of lc and multi - level lz steps .",
    "next , we calculate the threshold for phase - locking transitions analytically .     resonant capture probability ( the threshold for phase - locking transition ) obtained by solving the schrodinger eq .",
    "( [ eq : slow eq . ] ) subject to initial condition in the ground state .",

    "any given time only two levels are coupled , and the dynamics can be modeled by successive lz transitions . in this case , we can calculate the probability of each transition separately , and multiply the probabilities .",
    "the two level transformation matrix ( trmatrix ) in the energy basis for the @xmath102 transition yields the transition probability via the lz formula @xcite    @xmath103    where @xmath104 .",

    "thus , the capture into resonance occurs in the first few lz transitions and one can choose @xmath110 ( see fig .",

    "one can see a very good agreement between the two results in the lc limit ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "however , in the intermediate regime ( @xmath100 ) , oscillations in @xmath95 are observed before convergence at the predicted lc line .",
    "these oscillations are due to the mixing of more than two neighboring levels in passage through resonance ( see fig . [",

    "the classical ar phenomenon is now well understood @xcite .",

    "it should be emphasized that the simulation results in the figure are solutions of the _ quantum - mechanical equations _ ( [ eq : slow eq . ] ) with parameters in the classical regime , while the probabilities of capture were calculated using the proper transition level @xmath118 for each value of @xmath50 , as defined in eq .",

    "another observable of the phase - locking transition mentioned above is the width of the transition , which we define as the inverse slope @xmath119 of the phase - locking probability at @xmath120 .",
    "this width depends on the initial conditions governed by the thermal equilibrium with the environment .",
    "classically , the thermal width of the autoresonant transition scales as @xcite    @xmath121    however , at very low temperatures , the classical thermal noise becomes negligible , but quantum fluctuations remain .",
    "recent experiments in josephson circuits @xcite demonstrated quantum saturation of the transition width at the value obtained from eq.([eq : transition width ] ) , but with @xmath122 replaced by the energy @xmath123 of the ground level . more generally , it was suggested to calculate the width by replacing @xmath124 in the classical formula by an effective temperature , @xmath125 , in agreement with the experimental results .",
