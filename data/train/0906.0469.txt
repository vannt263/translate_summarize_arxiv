    "the production of strange particles has always been a key observable in heavy - ion reactions and its enhancement was one of the first suggested signatures for quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) formation @xcite .",
    "the predicted enhancement of strangeness production in nucleus ",
    "nucleus collisions relative to proton ",
    "proton reactions was established experimentally some time ago @xcite .",
    "it was also found that this enhancement is increasing with the strangeness content of the particle type @xcite .",
    "however , there are several aspects that make a straightforward interpretation of the experimental results difficult .",
    "one of them is the fact , that the strangeness enhancement seems to increase towards lower energies @xcite .",
    "another open issue and the topic of this publication is the dependence of the enhancement on the system size .",
    "the latter is quantified by the number of `` wounded ''",
    "nucleons from the colliding nuclei that participate in the reaction .",
    "a previous analysis investigated the pion , kaon , @xmath4 , and @xmath0  production in ( near-)central nucleus ",
    "nucleus collisions of nuclei with different mass numbers @xcite .",
    "it turned out that the enhancement sets in already for very small systems and seems to saturate for nuclei with mass number above 30 , i.  e. number of participants above 60 .",
    "the present study extends the investigation of the enhancement to non - central pb+pb collisions and to the production of @xmath1  and @xmath2  hyperons .    in the context of statistical models ,",
    "which generally have been quite successful in describing particles yields , the experimentally observed strangeness enhancement for large systems is due to the increase of the reaction volume , which weakens the influence of strangeness conservation on the production rate @xcite . in @xcite",
    "this has been modeled by the transition from a canonical ensemble to a grand - canonical one . for comparison of the corresponding statistical model results to experimental data ,",
    "the relation between the size of the ensemble volume @xmath5 and the experimentally accessible number of wounded nucleons @xmath6   has been assumed to be @xmath7 .",
    "the parameter @xmath8 , which accounts for the locality of the strangeness conservation , is usually fixed to @xmath9  7  @xmath10 @xcite . however , this approach does not provide a satisfactory description of the data @xcite . a better agreement with global strangeness production at the sps",
    "can be achieved by deriving the ensemble volume from a percolation of elementary clusters @xcite . a similar ,",
    "although simplified , line of argument is put forward in the so - called core - corona picture @xcite . here a heavy - ion collision is considered a superposition of a hot and dense core and a low density peripheral corona region .",
    "while the core region corresponds to a large fireball , which experiences collective expansion and for which particle production should be describable via a large volume canonical ensemble , or equivalently by a grand - canonical statistical ensemble , the corona is supposed to exhibit the features of simple nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "the contributions of the core and the corona depend on both the size of the colliding nuclei and the centrality of the collision and can be determined via glauber model calculations @xcite .",
    "this concept has recently been applied quite successfully to the system - size dependence of strangeness production at rhic energies @xcite .",
    "the comparison of measurements with hadron  string transport models , such as urqmd or hsd , provides insight into the question whether nucleus ",
    "nucleus collisions can be described in a hadronic scenario or whether a contribution from an additional partonic phase is needed . even though these models are not able to describe the enhancement of multi - strange particle yields in central nucleus ",
    "nucleus collisions @xcite , their predictions are generally close to the measured values for particles containing a single strange quark .",
    "their comparison to the measured system - size dependence might therefore reveal effects that go beyond the dominating influence of the reaction geometry , such as multi - pion fusion processes and , in the case of anti - baryons , absorption in dense nuclear matter .",
