    "diffusive transport is central in many areas of physics , chemistry , biology and soft matter  @xcite . however , while the mathematics of diffusive processes in dilute and simple media is fairly well developed and understood  @xcite , many interesting and relevant diffusive processes take place in strongly non - ideal conditions .",
    "these include a wealth of different highly dense media , from non - ideal plasmas  @xcite to biological membranes  @xcite , media with complex topological structures , including porous media  @xcite and living cells  @xcite and strongly confining environments  @xcite .",
    "crowding and confinement effects on diffusion - influenced phenomena still pose fundamental yet unanswered questions .",
    "concerning molecular mobility , for example , several computational and experimental indications exist of anomalous diffusion in the cell cytoplasm as a result of amount and type of crowding  @xcite , suggesting that living cells behave much like fractal or otherwise disordered systems  @xcite .",
    "however , strong evidences also exist in favour of normal ( brownian ) diffusion , crowding and confinement resulting in this scenario in ( often nontrivial ) modifications of the diffusion coefficient  @xcite .",
    "another related issue is that of diffusion - limited reactions  @xcite , which are ubiquitous in many domains in biology and chemistry , touching upon problems such as association , folding and stability of proteins  @xcite and bimolecular reactions in solution  @xcite , including enzyme kinetics  @xcite , but also the dynamics of _ active _ agents  @xcite .",
    "many theoretical studies have tackled these and related problems under different angles  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a full theoretical comprehension of transport in non - ideal media remains an elusive task , fick s law itself and the very notion of effective diffusion coefficient being questionable in a disordered medium  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider the subtle link between macroscopic transport equations , such as the diffusion equation , and microscopic processes , modeling the stochastic dynamics of some agents .",
    "the purpose of our study is two - fold .",
    "one the one hand , we wish to understand in greater depth the delicate procedure of obtaining mean - field transport equations from microscopic , agent - based stochastic models , paying special attention to what exactly is _ lost _ in going to the continuum .",
    "the idea is that sometimes it may prove simpler or more effective to describe a complex transport process ( or a simple one occurring in a complex _ milieu _ ) at the microscopic level . on the contrary , it is sometimes better to deal with macroscopic equations .",
    "it is thus important to investigate how the two levels of description interface with each other . on the other hand , as a result of our investigation , we will derive new macroscopic equations that provide useful analytical tools for exploring particle transport in non - ideal fluids in complex environments .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec:1 ]",
    "we discuss the general framework of simple exclusion processes ( seps ) , which constitute the basic tool of our microscopic description , as well as the process of obtaining mean - field equations from seps . in section  [ sec:2 ] ,",
    "we move a step forward and consider microscopic exclusion processes involving agents characterized by a _",
    "finite _ size , as opposed to standard seps .",
    "we introduce in particular the notions of _ point - like _ and _ extended _ crowding and discuss the formalism with reference to the problem of gravitational sedimentation .",
    "we then go on in section  [ sec:3 ] to propose , based on a simple analogy , a modified diffusion equation appropriate for describing transport in non - ideal fluids of @xmath0-dimensional hard spheres at high densities .",
    "the obtained equation allows one to recover a known result for the basic problem of particle flux at a spherical absorbing boundary in self - crowding media .",
    "finally , a summary of the main results obtained in this paper is drawn in the last section .",
    "simple exclusion processes are space - discrete , agent - based stochastic processes modeling some kind of transport according to specific rules and bound to the constraint that no two agents can ever occupy the same site .",
    "seps occupy a central role in non - equilibrium statistical physics  @xcite .",
    "while the first theoretical ideas underlying such processes can be traced back to boltzmann s works  @xcite , seps were introduced and widely studied in the 70s as simplified models of one - dimensional transport for phenomena like hopping conductivity  @xcite and kinetics of biopolymerization [ 5 ] . along the same lines , the asymmetric exclusion process ( asep ) , originally introduced by spitzer  @xcite , has become a paradigm in non - equilibrium statistical physics  @xcite and has now found many applications , such as the study of molecular motors  @xcite , transport through nano - channels  @xcite and depolymerization of microtubules  @xcite .",

    "a ( discrete - time ) master equation for the above sep can be obtained by averaging over many monte carlo cycles performed according to rule   @xmath24 + q^{-}_{i+1 } [ p_{i+1}(k ) - p_{i , i+1}(k ) ] \\nonumber \\\\                              & -q^{+}_{i } [ p_{i}(k ) - p_{i , i+1}(k ) ] - q^{-}_{i } [ p_{i}(k ) - p_{i , i-1}(k)]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined the one - body and two - body site occupancy probabilities @xmath25here @xmath26 denotes averages performed over many independent monte carlo cycles performed until time @xmath27 starting from the same initial condition .",

    "it is interesting to note that in the case of equivalent sites , which translates to a constant diffusion coefficient , the diffusive part of eq .",
    "becomes linear , _ i.e. _ the microscopic exclusion rule is _ lost _ in the diffusive part . in the case of zero field ,",

    "incidentally , this has to be the reason why the mean - field approximation does lose all the _ memory _ of the microscopic exclusion constraint and the diffusion equation is recovered for equivalent sites in the absence of a field .",

    "it is possible to substantiate and further illustrate the above considerations by showing that the transport equations for point - like and extended - size crowding for homogenous systems in a gravitational field allow to recover the appropriate equations of state ( eos ) for fully penetrable spheres ( fpss ) and totally impenetrable ( _ i.e. _ hard ) spheres ( tiss ) , respectively .",

    "the nice thing about this exercise is that we can derive an equation of state ( eos ) from the sedimentation profile .",

    "justification for eq .  , it is instructive to consider how the classical problem of diffusion to an absorbing sphere is modified in a non - ideal fluid .",

    "the aim of this procedure is to derive mean - field equations suitable for describing transport processes in many - body systems in highly non - ideal conditions .",
    "we have identified two strategies for doing so .",
    "the first route , termed _ point - like _ crowding , leads from a standard simple exclusion process to the mean - field equation  . for a homogenous medium in the absence of a field",
    "this reduces to a simple diffusion equation , which is why we have dubbed this scenario _ point - like _ crowding . only for inequivalent sites and/or in the presence of a field",
    "does the microscopic exclusion constraint survives in the mean - field limit .",
    "the second strategy , named _ extended - crowding _ , takes inspiration from a modified microscopic exclusion process in one dimension involving extended agents , the so - called @xmath55-asep  @xcite . by extending an argument originally put forward by lebowitz and percus in 1967 ,",
    "coupled to a local density approximation , we have posited a modified nonlinear diffusion equation suitable for studying in an effective manner transport processes in dense systems of hard spheres , eq .  .",

    "while extended crowding is indeed appropriate for diffusion of hard spheres , the continuum limit of point - like crowding exclusion processes is only appropriate for systems of fully penetrable spheres .",
    "therefore , when one takes the continuum limit , all signatures of the microscopic exclusion constraints are lost in the diffusive part of the transport equation .",
    "we note that eq .",
    "provides a sensible description of diffusion in a non - ideal fluid in the case where the problem has spherical symmetry .",
