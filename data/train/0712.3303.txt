    "the aim of the _ spitzer _ gould belt ( gb ; allen et al . in prep . ) and c2d @xcite legacy surveys is to build a complete mid - infrared record of star formation in all of the large molecular clouds within 500  pc , largely dominated by the gould belt itself .",

    "this emission is most likely pah - feature emission @xcite excited by the young , high mass stars in w40 @xcite , 20  to the east .",
    "we found structured @xmath5 nebulosity at the site in 2mass atlas images , but few sources .",
    "the region is flanked by two _ infrared astronomy satellite _ ( iras ) sources ( iras  18275 - 0203 and iras  18274 - 0205 ) , and _ midcourse space experiment _ ( msx ) coverage of this region reveals only a few additional point sources .",
    "no deep x - ray images of this region are available .",
    "we obtained 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0  @xmath0 m imaging of 5.1 square degrees of the serpens - aquila rift with irac @xcite onboard _ spitzer _ @xcite as part of the gb legacy survey ( pid : 30574 ) on 27 october 2006 . in this letter , we focus on the 14  @xmath6  10  field of view centered on serpens south ( r.a . ,",

    "serpens south appears to be associated with a filamentary cloud seen in absorption against pah emission from w40 ( fig .",
    "[ pretty1 ] ) . thus the distance to w40 ( 550  @xmath12  150  pc",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is an upper limit to the distance to serpens south .",
    "the serpens main cluster has local standard of rest ( lsr ) velocities in the range 6 - 11 , when observed in the isotopologues of co @xcite , with gaussian fwhm widths of @xmath13 .",
    "thus , its molecular line emission can be separated from that associated with w40 , which occurs in the lsr range of 2 - 6  @xcite , and is spatially compact .",
    "the sma data clearly show that the velocities of iras 18275 - 0203 and the nearby embedded source are the same as that of the serpens main cluster , and not of the w40 cluster .",
    "we therefore assign the distance of 260  @xmath12  37  pc @xcite to serpens south .",
    "this is consistent with more recent results for the entire serpens - aquila rift @xcite .",
    "we identify likely ysos from their excess infrared emission over that expected from a typical photosphere and high infrared flux compared to extragalactic contaminants @xcite .",
    "these candidates are classified as class  i ( protostar ) or class  ii ( pre - main sequence star with disk ) ysos by the their value of @xmath14 , the linear least squares fit to their spectral energy distribution ( log  @xmath15  vs.  log  @xmath16 ) through the four irac bandpasses @xcite . in this way",

    "half of the sources in this field of view are located in a region that stands out as both relatively high in surface density and dominated by sources that are protostellar . of the ysos",

    "( 2000 ) = 18:30:03 , @xmath702:01:58.2 , making up the core of the serpens south cluster ( fig .",
    "[ pretty1 ] ) . in this core ,",
    "77% of the ysos are protostellar , with a mean density of 430  pc@xmath3 .",
    "this dense grouping appears elongated in an alignment similar to the dust filament seen in absorption ( 150@xmath19 east of north ) .",
    "the asymmetric distribution suggests that the mean surface density of 430  pc@xmath3 in the core is likely a significant underestimate . to demonstrate this",
    ", we note that the median projected distance between nearest neighbor ysos here is 132 , or 3700  au .",
    "sources uniformly spaced at a density of 430  pc@xmath3 are 214 apart , or 5600  au .      to characterize the two dimensional structure of the serpens south cluster",
    ", we have constructed a nearest neighbor surface density map of all the _",
    "spitzer_-identified ysos ( fig .  [ surf1 ] ) .",
    "the method used to generate these maps is documented in @xcite that defines a circle that contains the nearest @xmath20 sources . from this radial distance , a surface density",
    "is directly computed as @xmath21 @xcite . ] , though we have used @xmath22 nearest neighbors here to sample the surface densities at higher fidelity ( 33% uncertainty ; * ? ? ?",
    "the elevated density is evident in the center of the map , with a peak density of 1600  pc@xmath3 .",
    "the apparent boundary contour for the dense cluster core is 590  pc@xmath3 , a more reasonable mean surface density than was measured over the poorly matched circular area used in section  [ i d ] above .",
    "lower density star formation along the dust filaments is also apparent at densities from 50 to 120  pc@xmath3 .",
    "the overall structure is elongated , reflecting the same orientation and extent as the filamentary cloud structures seen in absorption ( fig .  [ pretty1 ] ) .",
    "the serpens south core s high mean surface density ( @xmath2430  pc@xmath3 ) , exceptionally large fraction of class  i sources ( 77% ) , and relatively large membership ( 48 , with 43 more along the 0.5  pc cloud filaments ) suggest both a very recent onset of star formation ( within the typical lifetime of the protostellar phase , @xmath23  yr , cf . * ? ? ? * ) and high star formation rate ( @xmath1190  @xmath24  myr@xmath25 in the core , assuming the above protostellar phase lifetime and 0.5  @xmath24 per source ) .",
    "visually , the region bears some resemblance to the serpens main cluster @xcite that we have shown lie at similar distances . in fig .",
    "[ sbs1 ] , we present 6.5  @xmath6  6.5  ( 0.5  pc  @xmath6  0.5  pc ) 8  @xmath0 m images of the dense cores of both the serpens south and serpens main clusters , overplotted with the positions of _ spitzer _ identified class  i and class  ii sources @xcite . over these fields of view",
    ", the two regions have nearly identical numbers of ysos with excess infrared emission and similar protostar fractions ( 55 at 71% and 54 at 57% in serpens south and serpens main , respectively ) . however , serpens south is more concentrated and confined to its filament axis than serpens main , as evidenced by median nearest neighbor distances between ysos of 3700  au and 4800  au , respectively .",
    "these results suggest that serpens south is at least as young and as prolific a star forming region as serpens main , though sampling statistics prevent us from making any claims beyond similarity . at larger scales ,",
    "both serpens main and serpens south are active star forming sites embedded in larger , less dense , less extinguished distributions of ysos . given the high likelihood that both clusters are associated with the serpens - aquila rift and their structural and evolutionary similarity over such a large projected distance from each other ( 197  or 15  pc ) , we speculate that the initial conditions of this region play a strong role in defining these qualities .",
    "serpens south joins a growing number of young clusters that are protostar rich and asymmetrically structured .",
    "the more typical asymmetric clusters ( e.g. ngc  1333 , iras  20050 + 2720 , ggd  12 - 15 ) have evolved to the point that star formation is active throughout most sites of dense gas in their natal clouds .",
    "this is supported by their large numbers of protostars ( active current star formation ) , their larger numbers of stars with disks ( star formation in the recent past ) , and the distributions of both yso types that appear to reflect the typically filamentary dense gas distributions @xcite .",
    "serpens south has a particularly high protostar fraction though ( 59% ; ngc 1333 is 29% protostars , excluding transition disks ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and it is part of a dense , dusty cloud filament that is currently forming stars at a rather low surface density compared to the core . if the rest of the filament continues forming stars within the next few @xmath26  yr , we speculate that this region could evolve into an asymmetric cluster of similar number of sources and protostar fraction to the aforementioned asymmetric examples .",
    "therefore , the serpens south cluster could be described as a _",
    "protocluster _ , a region with a sufficiently high star formation rate to produce a large number of stars before gas dispersal processes ( outflows , radiation , etc . ) from the growing cluster membership terminate the process .",
    "given its close proximity , follow - up observations ( e.g. to characterize the gas distribution and kinematics ) and detailed analysis should offer a new and unique view of the earliest stages of clustered star formation .",
    "we thank t. dame and e. winston for providing data from @xcite and @xcite in electronic form .",
