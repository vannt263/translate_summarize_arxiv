    "at zero temperature and shear stress , a packing of frictionless spheres undergoes the jamming transition when its volume fraction @xmath6 is varied across a critical value @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this transition is denoted as point j in the jamming phase diagram @xcite .",
    "although @xmath7 may vary with protocols @xcite , it has been demonstrated that the maximally random jammed packings of hard spheres with single size ( mono - disperse ) usually exist at a well - defined volume fraction @xmath8 @xcite , which is also the most probable volume fraction for hard spheres to jam at @xcite .",
    "when the spheres are deformable and interact via pairwise short - range repulsion , a marginally jammed solid is formed when the volume fraction is slightly greater than @xmath7 .",
    "marginally jammed solids have multiple critical scalings with @xmath9 of some mechanical and geometrical quantities such as the pressure , bulk modulus , shear modulus , and coordination number ( average number of interacting neighbors per particle ) @xcite , implying the criticality of point j. point j is isostatic @xcite , i.e. the coordination number @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the dimension of space .",
    "the isostaticity is the minimum requirement of particle constraints to maintain mechanical stability and plays a key role in the control of properties of typical jammed systems such as glasses @xcite .",
    "therefore , understanding point j is a good starting point to study some long - standing problems , e.g. glass transition @xcite and the unusual thermal properties of glasses @xcite .",
    "the jamming transition at point j is puzzling compared to conventional critical phenomena . for instance , during the jamming transition , there is no apparent structural change .",
    "consequently , a diverging static correlation length , e.g. the density correlation length present in the long wave - length limit , that can be observed in typical phase transitions is lacking .",
    "however , jammed packings of mono - disperse spheres still exhibit nonanalytic density fluctuations different from simple liquids @xcite : the static structure factor @xmath3 in the long wave - length limit , where @xmath12 is the magnitude of the wave vector , while in simple liquids @xmath2 is quadratic with @xmath13 .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath14 indicates that jammed mono - disperse systems are hyperuniform @xcite .    to successfully avoid crystallization ,",
    "a binary mixture of particles with two sizes ( bi - disperse ) is usually employed .",
    "although some mechanical and vibrational properties of marginally jammed solids do not qualitatively depend on the ratio of the two particle sizes , we are short of systematic knowledge about how the particle - size ratio might affect jamming . for bi - disperse systems , it is also tempted to assume that either the large or the small particles can be taken as representative to describe the properties of the whole system .",
    "for instance , one may assume that @xmath2 measured for large particles and small particles are identical , so that the observation of @xmath3 in jammed mono - disperse systems is universal and all jammed systems are thus hyperuniform .    in this paper",
    ", we study whether and how the particle - size ratio affects the properties of jammed binary mixtures . by increasing the ratio @xmath1 of the diameter of the two species from @xmath15",
    ", we observe an increase of the critical volume fraction @xmath7 and a decrease of the bulk modulus accompanied with the increase of rattlers ( particles with no interacting neighbors ) .",
    "most importantly , the inclusion of bi - dispersity qualitatively changes the static structure factor @xmath2 especially in the long wave - length limit .",
    "the linear behavior of @xmath2 in the long wave - length limit is thus only valid for jammed mono - disperse systems .",
    "the systems studied consist of @xmath16 frictionless spheres with the same mass @xmath17 , contained in three dimensional cubic boxes with length @xmath18 and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "half of the particles have a diameter @xmath19 , while the other half have a diameter @xmath20 with @xmath21 .",
    "particles interact via short range harmonic repulsion : the inter - particle potential @xmath22 when the separation between particles @xmath23 and @xmath24 , @xmath25 is less than the sum of their radii @xmath26 , and zero otherwise .",
    "this numerical model has been widely used in the studies of jamming , and is a typical model of granular materials , glasses , and foams .",
    "we vary the diameter ratio @xmath1 from @xmath27 to @xmath28 to carry out a systematic study of its effects on the properties of the jammed systems .",
    "we note that most of the reported studies have focused on two specific values of @xmath1 : @xmath29 and @xmath30 . to generate jammed packings of frictionless spheres",
    ", we quickly quench random configurations at high temperatures and fixed volume fraction to the local energy minima using l - bfgs minimization routine @xcite .",
    "we tune the volume fraction until a packing with desired pressure is obtained . in order to reduce quench rate dependence , we start at a volume fraction which is pretty close to the destination , so that tuning the volume fraction does not lead to significant particle rearrangements .",
