    "however , during the _ einstein _   observation of 1980 , several years prior to the _ exosat _  detections , it displayed a 0.510 kev luminosity of @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the source can therefore be classified as a transient x - ray binary .",
    "nevertheless , such systems typically exhibit accretion outbursts that last only weeks to months ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whereas exo  0748676  was persistently detected at luminosities of @xmath9 by various satellites for over 24 years .",
    "similar prolonged accretion episodes continuing for years to decades have been observed for a few other systems , which are termed quasi - persistent x - ray binaries ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "september , observations with the proportional counter array ( pca ) onboard the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _",
    "( _ rxte _ ) and _ swift _ s x - ray telescope ( xrt ) indicated that the x - ray flux of exo  0748676  was declining @xcite .",
    "optical and near - ir observations of the optical counterpart , uy  vol , performed in 2008 october showed that the optical emission had also faded compared to the brighter x - ray state @xcite .",

    "although the soft spectral component has been ascribed to low - level accretion @xcite , it is most often interpreted as thermal surface radiation from the cooling neutron star @xcite . according to this model",
    ", the accretion of matter compresses the neutron star crust , which induces a series of electron captures , neutron emissions and pycnonuclear fusion reactions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the heat energy released in these processes is spread over the neutron star via thermal conduction .",
    "the neutron star cools primarily via neutrino emissions from the stellar core , as well as photon radiation from the surface .",
    "the former depends on the equation of state of cold nuclear matter and the central density of the neutron star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the neutron star core reaches a thermal steady state in @xmath12  years , yielding an incandescent emission from the neutron star surface set by the time - averaged accretion rate of the system , as well as the rate of neutrino emissions from the stellar core ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "when combined with estimates of the outburst history , observations of quiescent neutron stars can constrain the rate of neutrino emissions , thereby providing insight into the interior properties of the neutron star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "once the steady state is reached , the neutron star core temperature will not change appreciably during a single outburst , but the temperature of the crust can be dramatically altered . in regular transients that have a typical outburst duration of weeks to months , the crustal heating processes will only cause a slight increase in the crust temperature @xcite",
    ". however , in quasi - persistent x - ray binaries the prolonged accretion episodes can cause a significant temperature gradient between the neutron star crust and core .",
    "once the accretion ceases , the crust is expected to thermally relax on a time scale of years , until equilibrium with the core is re - established @xcite . during the initial stages of the quiescent phase the thermal emission",
    "will therefore be dominated by the cooling crust , whereas eventually a quiescent base level is reached that is set by the thermal state of the core @xcite .",
    "this provides the special opportunity to separately probe the properties of the neutron star crust @xcite .    in 2001 , the neutron star x - ray binaries ks  1731260  and mxb  165929  both made the transition to quiescence , following accretion episodes of 12.5 and 2.5 years , respectively @xcite .",

    "therefore , we also fitted the neutron star temperatures obtained for exo  0748676  to a powerlaw and found decay indices of @xmath119 and @xmath120 for the _ chandra _  and _ swift _  data sets , respectively .",
    "the _ swift _",
    "observations indicate that a possible break in the quiescent lightcurve may have occurred @xmath121  days after the cessation of the outburst ( see section  [ subsec : decay ] ) . by fitting a broken powerlaw function",
    ", we obtain a decay index of @xmath62 before the break , which steepens to @xmath63 thereafter .",
    "however , since these slopes are consistent with being equal , further observations are required to confirm whether a break has indeed occurred .",
    "the decay parameters that we find for exo  0748676  are comparable to that obtained by @xcite for xte  j1701462 .",
    "these authors found that the quiescent lightcurve breaks @xmath122 days post - outburst and report decay indices of @xmath123 and @xmath124 before and after the break , respectively .",
    "@xcite note that possible cross - calibration effects between _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  might introduce small shifts that also allow a single powerlaw decay with slope @xmath125 .",
    "the cooling curves of ks  1731260  and mxb  165929  appear to have steeper decays with indices of @xmath126 and @xmath127 , respectively @xcite . due to the scarcity of data points",
    "it is unclear whether a break occurred in the quiescent lightcurves of the latter two sources @xcite .",
    "the powerlaw fits show no indications that the quiescent lightcurve of exo  0748676  is levelling off .",
    "thus , it is also possible that the neutron star temperature continues to decay further and that the core is cooler than suggested by the exponential decay fits and the 1980 _ einstein _  detection . the relatively slow decrease of exo  0748676",
    "might then reflect that the crust has a high conductivity , albeit lower than that of the neutron stars in ks  1731260  and mxb  165929 .",
    "further observations are thus required to determine whether the neutron star crust in exo  0748676  has nearly cooled down and to be able to draw firm conclusions on the crust and core properties .",
