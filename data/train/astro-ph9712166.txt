    "particle  particle collisions among electrons , and electrons and ions , are rare in rarefied hot plasmas , such as the ones thought to be responsible for the high energy emission in seyfert galaxies .",
    "it is therefore unclear if the plasma in these sources can be described by a thermal , maxwellian distribution , especially during the fast variations often observed in their x  ray flux and spectrum . on the other hand the osse observations of the brightest seyfert galaxies ( i.e. ngc 4151 and ic 4329 , see e.g. zdziarski , johnson & magdziarz 1996 , madejski et al .",
    "1995 ) show the presence of a high energy cut  off , highly indicative of a thermal nature of the underlying plasma .",
    "similar indications are obtained from the sum of 60 combined spectra of 27 seyfert galaxies ( zdziarski et al .",
    "1995 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a new thermalization mechanism , based on the process of synchrotron and cyclotron self  absorption .",
    "electrons embedded in a magnetic field emit and absorb their own cyclo  synchrotron radiation and can exchange energy by exchanging photons .",
    "we will show that complete thermalization occurs ( in a few cooling times ) in sources magnetically dominated and when the radiation is completely self  absorbed . increasing the amount of compton cooling makes the peak of the maxwellian distribution to shift to lower energies , with the development of a high energy tail .    using the found equilibrium electron distribution",
    "we compute the comptonization spectra in the framework of the two  phase model of haardt & maraschi ( 1991 ) and haardt , maraschi & ghisellini ( 1994 ) .",
    "we calculate how the hot magnetized plasma , above a relatively cold accretion disk , reaches a steady state equilibrium distribution through synchrotron self  absorption and by comptonizing the seed photons coming from the disk .",
    "we show that as long as the hot phase is magnetically dominated , the equilibrium temperatures and mean energies of the emitting plasma are in agreement with the existing observations , quite independently of the size of the region .",
    "there is however an important difference with respect to a pure thermal scenario , in which particles are assumed to always be in thermal equilibrium . here ,",
    "in fact we consider the case of continuous injection of new , energetic electrons , up to some maximum energy @xmath0 .",
    "this implies that :    \\1 ) to reach steady state requires some form of escape of the injected electrons in order to avoid a pile up of cold electrons . also reacceleration could occur , but we do not consider this case here .",
    "\\2 ) the final distribution is sensitive to the mean energy of the injected electrons , i.e. to @xmath1 , and to the spectral shape of the injected distribution .",
    "\\3 ) we neglect the possible role played by electron ",
    "positron pairs created by the produced @xmath2rays .",
    "this could be a self  regulating mechanism to keep @xmath1 small ( see ghisellini , haardt & fabian , 1993 ) .",
    "here we assume a given fixed value of @xmath1 .",
    "note that the model proposed here is an hybrid between non  thermal and thermal models , because it assumes a continuous injection of electrons ( and not a re  heating ) , which nevertheless reach a thermal ( or quasi ",
    "thermal ) distribution .",
    "previous related studies on the subject of synchrotron reabsorption have been made by ghisellini , guilbert & svensson ( 1988 , hereafter ggs88 ) by ghisellini & svensson ( 1989 ) , and by de kool , begelman & sikora ( 1989 ) .",
    "these studies demonstrated that a quasi ",
    "maxwellian distribution can form at the low energy end of an otherwise power law distribution . in these cases , in fact , electrons were injected at very high energies ( @xmath3 ) and thin synchrotron emission was the main cooling process .",
    "the problem of deriving the equilibrium distribution in the presence of self ",
    "compton losses was briefly discussed by ghisellini & svensson ( 1989 ) .",
    "the present paper differs from previous work because we study a regime where cyclo  synchrotron emission is almost completely self  absorbed , and the main cooling mechanism is due to the inverse compton of photons produced in a relatively cold accretion disk .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section 2 we describe the main assumptions of the model and the used equations , in section 3 we describe our results , which are then discussed in section 4 .",
    "assume that in a region of dimension @xmath4 relativistic electrons are injected at a rate @xmath5 [ @xmath6 s@xmath7 between @xmath8 and @xmath1 . a tangled magnetic field @xmath9 of energy density @xmath10 makes them radiate synchrotron ( s ) photons .",
    "these photons , together with photons produced externally to the region , interact with the electrons by the inverse compton ( ic ) process .",
    "if the electron distribution extends to a @xmath1 of the order of a few , the synchrotron spectrum is completely self absorbed , and the total radiation energy density ( @xmath11 ) may be dominated by the photons produced externally .",
    "we will assume @xmath12 .",
    "due to self absorption and the presence of external photons , this does @xmath13 correspond to the prevalence of the synchrotron luminosity over the inverse compton one .",
    "the electron distribution @xmath14 is the result of the injection , the s and ic losses , and the energy gain due to self absorption ( ggs88 )    @xmath15 + q - { n \\over t_{\\rm esc}}\\ , \\eqno(1)\\ ] ] where the momentum @xmath16 is measured in units of @xmath17 and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the cooling rates for synchrotron and inverse compton losses , respectively :    @xmath20    @xmath21 equation ( 3 ) assumes that the compton cooling is in the thomson regime .",
    "the kinetic equation ( 1 ) differs from the analougous equation ( 2 ) of ggs88 by the inclusion of the compton loss term @xmath19 .",
    "the factor @xmath22 is defined below .",
    "the last term represents electron escape from the plasma region with the escape time being @xmath23 .",
    "we use @xmath24 .",
    "we assume that the radiation energy density @xmath11 is dominated by an external soft photon distribution , and by the ` hard ' radiation produced by comptonizing these photons .",
    "the soft photons are assumed to arise from the reprocessing of half of the hard radiation by cold matter in the vicinity of the active region as detailed in haardt & maraschi ( 1991 ) . in steady state ,",
    "all the power injected in the form of relativistic electrons balances the escaping luminosity .",
    "part of the power escapes as kinetic energy flux and part is converted into radiation , mainly at high ( uv and x  ray ) energies , via ic .",
    "the ratio of the two depends upon the ratio of the escape and the ic cooling timescales .    since the cyclo ",
    "synchrotron emission is completely self  absorbed , it is the ic process which is mainly responsible for the radiation losses , even if @xmath25 . the compton process becomes efficient after a time @xmath26 , which is the timescale required to build up the soft photon radiation field . after this time the radiation energy density can be written as @xmath27 ( \\gamma-1 ) d\\gamma \\ , \\eqno(4)\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is a numerical coefficient ( of order unity ) which depends on the geometry ( @xmath29 for a sphere and @xmath30 for a slab ) .",
    "we use @xmath31 .",
    "the factor @xmath32 accounts for the enhancement of the photon density due to thomson scattering with the electrons , the optical depth of which is @xmath33 at equilibrium , the number of injected electrons must be balanced by the number of escaping electrons . in steady state",
    "the optical depth becomes @xmath34    the factor @xmath35 in equation ( 1 ) describes the heating of the electrons and their diffusion in energy .",
    "it is defined as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the power spectrum emitted by a single electron through the synchrotron process , and @xmath38 is the radiation mean intensity due to the s and ic process , with the former dominating the absorption ( and hence the heating ) .",
    "@xmath38 is calculated by @xmath39 \\eqno(7)\\ ] ] where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the emissivity and the absorption coefficient of cyclo - synchrotron radiation , as calculated in ggs88 .",
    "since we are dealing with mildly relativistic electrons , we must specify the cyclo ",
    "synchrotron emissivity of the single electron .",
    "most existing expressions are either nonrelativistic or only valid at large harmonics ( petrosian 1981 ) .",

    "this expression ( i ) has the correct cooling rate , equation ( 2 ) , when integrated over frequency , ( ii ) has the correct frequency dependence , @xmath44 , at large harmonics ( @xmath45 ) in the nonrelativistic limit , ( iii ) has the correct frequency dependence , at large harmonics in the ultrarelativistic limit , and ( iv ) the agreement at smaller harmonics , @xmath46 , is better than 40% at @xmath47 .",
    "for @xmath48 we use the usual synchrotron formula averaged over isotropically distributed pitch angles ( see , e.g. , ggs88 ) .    the kinetic equation ( 1 )",
    "can be solved for @xmath14 as a function of @xmath5 , the magnetic field @xmath9 , and the size @xmath4 .",
    "equivalently , besides @xmath4 , one can specify the injected and the magnetic compactnesses .",
    "the total ( including rest mass ) injected compactness is @xmath49 where @xmath50 and where @xmath51 is the volume of the region .",
    "the magnetic compactness is defined as @xmath52    in the two phase model for seyfert galaxies , the high energy radiation could be produced by a uniform corona ( haardt & maraschi 1991 ) or by localized active regions ( possibly highly magnetized ; haardt , maraschi & ghisellini , 1994 ) . assuming the second possibility , the dimensions of each region , or blob , is of the order of a few schwarzschild radii .",
    "( i.e. @xmath53 cm ) .",
    "observations of the high energy continuum and variability in seyfert galaxies indicate that their compactness is of the order of 1300 ( done & fabian , 1989 ) .",
    "we then assume that @xmath54 is in these range of values .",
    "our assumption of @xmath25 then also fixes the range of @xmath55 .",
    "when escape is not important ( i.e. , for @xmath56 , see below ) we have @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the average of @xmath2 over @xmath5 .",
    "the ratio of the cooling time scale , @xmath59 , to the escape time , @xmath60 , is given by @xmath61 this is always less than unity for @xmath62 , implying that electrons cool rather than escape for sufficiently large compactnesses .",
    "below we use @xmath63 10 or 30 .    electrons may also thermalize through coulomb energy exchange ( e.g. , stepney 1983 , dermer & liang 1989 , nayakshin & melia 1996 , pilla & shaham 1997 ) . the thermal electron - electron coulomb energy exchange rate can be approximated with ( e.g. , stepney 1983 ) @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the coulomb logarithm , typically @xmath66 10 - 20 , and @xmath67 is the dimensionless temperature .",
    "the thermal average of equation ( 2 ) becomes @xmath68 thermalization by synchrotron selfabsorption dominates when @xmath69 , which gives @xmath70 @xmath71 for @xmath72 .",
    "one sees that the coulomb process dominates for small temperatures and large @xmath73 ( i.e. , large electron densities ) . from equations ( 5b ) , ( 9 ) , and ( 10 ) , we find that the thomson optical depth is given by @xmath74 thermalization by synchrotron selfabsorption then dominates for temperatures @xmath75",
    "figure 1 shows the evolution of the electron distribution towards the equilibrium configuration .",
    "the injected electrons have a gaussian energy distribution peaking at @xmath76 .",
    "the magnetic field has a value @xmath77 g and the injected power corresponds to @xmath78 .",
    "the size of the source is @xmath79 cm .",
    "as can be seen , the equilibrium shape of @xmath80 is reached in a time @xmath81 , about equal to the nonrelativistic cooling time ( see eq .",
    "13 ) . with the assumed input parameters , the synchrotron terms ( emission , absorption and energy diffusion ) in the kinetic equation are dominant over compton losses .",
    "gains and losses in this case almost perfectly balance . as a result",
    "the equilibrium electron distribution is a maxwellian .",
    "figure 1 also shows that the high energy part of the maxwellian distribution is formed earlier than the low energy part , due to the higher efficiency of exchanging photons of the high energy electrons .",
    "a slower evolution takes place after 0.1(r / c ) , as balance between electron injection and electron escape is achieved on a time scale of a few @xmath60 . only then have both the shape and the amplitude of @xmath82 reached their equilibrium values .",
    "the equilibrium distributions for different values of the injected power are shown in figure 2 .",
    "the magnetic compactness is set to @xmath83 , corresponding to @xmath84 g for @xmath79 cm . in all cases ,",
    "the injected distribution is @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is a normalization constant and @xmath87 .",
    "the minimum lorentz factor is @xmath88 .",
    "the resulting mean injected lorentz factor is @xmath89 .",
    "as long as @xmath90 , the distribution is a quasi ",
    "perfect maxwellian at all energies .",
    "this is the result of the quasi  perfect balance between energy gains and losses , as also seen in fig .",
    "2 : compton losses ( not balanced by a corresponding compton heating term ) are a small perturbation . as @xmath54 increases towards values @xmath91 , compton losses start to be relevant , competing with synchrotron processes . at high energies ,",
    "losses overcome gains , and the electrons diffuse backwards in energy , until the subrelativistic regime is reached . only in this regime ,",
    "the increased efficiency of synchrotron gains ( relative to losses ) halts the systematic backward diffusion in energy , and a maxwellian can form ( see ghisellini & svensson 1989 ) .",
    "we can evaluate the temperature of this part of @xmath92 [ or , equivalently , of @xmath82 ] by fitting a maxwellian to the the low energy part of the distribution , up to energies just above the peak .",
    "the resulting temperatures are plotted in figure 3 as a function of @xmath94 .",
    "as can be seen , for low values of @xmath54 the temperature is quasi  constant , and decreases for @xmath54 greater than 1 .",
    "also shown in figure 3 is the behavior of the  effective temperature \" @xmath95 , defined by [ @xmath96 : @xmath97 where the average is over the electron distibution @xmath92 .",
    "as expected , for small @xmath54 , @xmath95 is well approximated by @xmath98 , while the effective temperature is larger than @xmath98 for @xmath99 , as a result of the shift of the maxwellian part to small energies , and the corresponding appearence of the high energy tail .    along the sequence , the optical depth increases from @xmath100 for @xmath101 to @xmath102 for @xmath103 , according to equation ( 16 ) . for our parameters and",
    "@xmath104 , equation ( 17 ) becomes @xmath105 , which is plotted as the solid line in figure 3 .",
    "one sees that that synchrotron self absorption dominates the thermalization for all cases with @xmath54 smaller than about 60 . for the case",
    "@xmath106 100 , one can not neglect coulomb thermalization .    with the values of @xmath107 and @xmath73 ,",
    "it is of interest to calculate the compton parameter @xmath108 defined by @xmath109 which is also plotted in figure 3 . at equilibrium ,",
    "@xmath73 is given by equation ( 16 ) and @xmath107 can not exceed the value of @xmath110 obtained by doing the average in equation ( 18 ) over the injected distribution @xmath5 .",
    "this implies that @xmath108 has a maximum possible value , @xmath111 .",
    "this limiting value is reached only when radiative cooling is negligible .",
    "the actual value of @xmath108 is then further constrained by the amount of radiative cooling .    for @xmath112 , @xmath113 , but the amount of compton cooling ( dominant in this cases )",
    "keeps the value of @xmath108 close to unity . the fact that @xmath114 is to be expected : this value ensures equal power between the comptonized radiation and the soft seed photon emission .",
    "for @xmath115 , @xmath111 is instead less than unity : compton cooling is negligible , and the actual value of @xmath108 is only slightly less than @xmath111 , due to synchrotron losses , which , albeit small , are in these cases dominant over compton losses .      in figure 4 , we show the radiation spectra corresponding to some of the equilibrium electron distributions of figure 2 .",
    "each spectrum consists of several continuum components :    \\i ) the self ",
    "absorbed synchrotron spectrum ( s ) ;",
    "\\ii ) the comptonized synchrotron spectrum ( ssc ) ;    \\iii ) the thermal soft component ( bump ) ;    \\iv ) the spectrum resulting from comptonization of the photons from the thermal bump ( ic ) ;    \\v ) the compton reflection component .    in addition ,",
    "not shown in the plots , fluorescence line emission from photoionized iron in the accretion disk and absorption features due to partially ionized warm gas along the line of sight are expected to be present in the spectrum .",
    "for each model the values of the compactnesses of the compton ( ssc+ic ) component and the synchrotron component are calculated as discussed in  2 . in the adopted geometry , neglecting the disk albedo , the compactness corresponding to the soft photon input is @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the compactness available for radiation production , defined as the difference between the injected and the escaping @xmath118 compactnesses , i.e. subtracting the rest mass energy of the electrons from the total energy .",
    "the temperature of the soft radiation is then calculated assuming black body emission from a region of radius @xmath4 .",
    "the synchrotron and soft component are then comptonized in a plane parallel slab following the prescriptions described in haardt ( 1994 ) . for the synchrotron component",
    "we assume a homogeneous source function within the scattering medium , while the thermal soft photon input is localized below the active region , giving rise to anisotropic compton emission ( haardt 1993 ) . a face - on line of sight is assumed for all the spectra .",
    "the following features may be noticed :    for @xmath119 , the comptonized spectrum is bumpy , due to the small value of @xmath73 and the large value of @xmath120 . as reported in figure 3 , the @xmath108 parameter is smaller than unity , making compton losses relatively unimportant .",
    "the synchrotron component , albeit self  absorbed , is more important than the comptonized power .",
    "the luminosity in the thermal  bump \" ( in the uv ) is roughly half of the synchrotron luminosity ( in the ir )",
    ". therefore , ssc and the ic components have approximately the same luminosity ratio as between the synchrotron and the thermal  bump \" luminosities .",
    "angular pattern , where @xmath121 is the viewing angle ( here , @xmath122 ) .",
    "note also that , while the ssc emission is isotropic at all energies , the ic component is not : the emission of the first order scattering in the @xmath123 direction is depressed ( haardt 1993 ) . at higher energies , both the ic and the ssc components are isotropic , and here",
    "their luminosity ratio has the expected value .",
    "] due to the anisotropy compton effect , _ the 210 kev band is dominated by the ssc component _ , rather than by the ic .",
    "this is in contrast to the general view interpreting the high energy emission in seyfert galaxies as due to comptonization of thermal bump photons . here",
    "the thermal bump and the x  ray flux are not directly related .",
    "increasing @xmath54 up to 1 , the compton cooling becomes more important ( @xmath108 approaches 1 ) , making i ) the the synchrotron component ( and the related ssc ) weaker , and ii ) the hard x  ray slope flatter .",
    "for @xmath124 the comptonized spectra have the typical ic power law shape , with increasing ( steeping ) spectral indices as @xmath54 increases .",
    "the reason for this steepening even for constant @xmath125 , is explained in detail in haardt , maraschi & ghisellini ( 1997 ) .",
    "finally , note that for @xmath126 , the high energy part can be described by an exponential , since the electron distribution is a quasi ",
    "perfect maxwellian in the entire energy range . for @xmath124 ,",
    "the electron distribution is more complex ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , resulting in a more complex radiation spectrum above @xmath127500 kev .",
    "the relevant quantities for the synchrotron thermalization process are the injected and the magnetic compactnesses .",
    "these parameters are independent of radius , and therefore the process should be largely independent upon the size of the source .",
    "however , since @xmath128 ( equation 11 ) , the same value of @xmath129 now implies @xmath130 gauss . in turn",
    ", the increase of the magnetic field implies that the energy range of the electrons emitting optically thick synchrotron radiation is reduced .",
    "this affects the synchrotron emission for small values of @xmath54 , which now can have an optically thin component from the most energetic electrons .    for illustration",
    ", we have repeated our calculations assuming a source size of @xmath131 cm , i.e. few schwarzchild radii for a galactic black hole .",
    "for @xmath132 the resulting equilibrium electron distributions are almost identical to the @xmath79 case , since the synchrotron radiation is completely self  absorbed . for @xmath119 ,",
    "the results are similar , but the resulting effective temperatures are smaller ( by a factor 2 for the @xmath101 case ) , due to the presence of a thin synchrotron component .",
    "the computed radiation spectra are shown in figure 5 .",
    "they exhibit the same basic features as seen in the extragalactic case ( fig .",
    "4 ) , but with two major differences : i ) as expected , the synchrotron emission is more important , with a corresponding more relevant ssc component contributing to the x  ray spectrum for @xmath126 .",
    "the increased synchrotron cooling makes the comptonized components steeper than the corresponding cases in figure 4 ; ii ) the peak energies of the thermal  bump \" and the synchrotron emission are now in the soft x  ray and uv bands , respectively .",
    "we have shown that the exchange of cyclo  synchrotron photons in a self absorbed source is a very efficient thermalizion mechanism , especially when the density and temperature of the plasma prevent the thermalization via particle  particle processes .    in our calculations",
    "we assume that the magnetic energy density in the flaring corona dominates over both gas and radiation pressure .",
    "this is sensible assumptions in the picture of an active corona .",
    "in fact the accretion mechanism is thought to amplify the magnetic field via some sort of dynamo process , and eventually particles in the corona are energized via buoyancy and reconnection of the field lines .",
    "regardless of the largely unknown physics of such processes , it is conceivable that the particles , ( and the radiation field they create because of cooling ) , can not be energetically dominant , as their energy is ultimately drained from the ( amplifield ) magnetic field .",
    "note that this argument is true only if the reconnection timescale is larger than the cooling timescale for a radiating electron , something we have implicitly assumed allowing for steady state particle injection .",
    "we now discuss how the main results of the model change by varying some of the input parameters .",
    "as already mentioned , we have assumed , for all shown cases , an injected electron distribution @xmath133 with @xmath87 , resulting in @xmath89 .",
    "the emitted radiation spectrum is basically controlled by @xmath73 , since its value , coupled to the condition @xmath134 , determines the physical conditions in the source . since @xmath135 ( eq .",
    "16 ) , the assumed _ shape _ of the injected distribution is not important , as long as different distributions have the same @xmath58 .",
    "changing @xmath54 and @xmath58 by the same factor hence gives rise to the same photon spectrum , provided that the condition @xmath136 is matched , and that the synchrotron emission is mostly self  absorbed .",
    "in other words , the same spectra shown in , e.g. , figure 4 , would be obtained for values of @xmath54 different than those indicated if an input distribution with a different @xmath58 were used .",
    "it is important to note that the value of @xmath58 can not be taken too large , as it changes the fraction of self  absorbed synchrotron radiation .",
    "as long as the synchrotron emission is mostly self  absorbed , the spectra obtained for the same value of @xmath73 and @xmath137 are indeed identical . going to very large @xmath58 , the conditions of self - absorption breaks down : the electrons cool down mainly because of synchrotron losses , with neglibible comptonization , changing completely the resulting radiation spectrum .    as can be inferred from the shown cases ,",
    "the value of @xmath4 is largely unimportant : its value determines the peak frequencies of the synchrotron and bump components , but not the main characteristics of the electron and radiation spectra .",
    "the thermalization process described in this paper is operating whenever energetic electrons and some magnetic field is present , but it becomes of great interest in the study of the high energy spectrum of compact sources when the mean energy of the electrons is less than a few mev and when the magnetic field is energetically dominant .",
    "these conditions ensure that the synchrotron spectrum is completely self  absorbed , and the entire electron distribution is influenced by self  absorption .",
    "this also ensures that the synchrotron emission does not overproduce the observed ir ( optical ) emission observed in radio  quiet agn ( galactic black hole candidates ) .",
    "however , the cyclo  synchrotron process does contribute to the ir ( optical ) emission , thought to be mainly due to reprocessing of the primary disk radiation by , e.g. , dust .",
    "since the same electrons contribute also to the x  ray band , simultaneous variability in the ir and x  ray bands should clearly identify this component , allowing the determination of the fraction of synchrotron radiation .",
    "its relative importance decreases by increasing the injected compactness ( see fig .",
    "an important outcome of our calculations concerns the x  ray emission . if the magnetic field is dominant ( i.e. its energy density is larger than the radiation energy density ) and the comptonization parameter @xmath108 is smaller than unity , the scattering of internal cyclo ",
    "synchrotron photons is more important than the scattering of the external ,  disk \" photons .",
    "the variability pattern expected in our model is therefore rather complex , since different components can contribute in different bands , and their relative importance depends on the magnetic field dominance .",
    "when synchrotron emission is important , the 210 kev emission could be only indirectly related to the uv bump photons .",
    "simultaneous uv and x  ray variability ( though with different amplitudes ) should allow the determination of the importance of the synchrotron and ssc components .",
