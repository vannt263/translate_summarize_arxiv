    "in past thirty years , the effective theory studies on physics of light vector meson resonances(@xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) have attracted much interests .",
    "works in this field have helped us to understand various aspects on low energy qcd and properties of light vector mesons . a challenging subject in these studies",
    "is to construct a well - defined chiral expansion theory at vector meson scale . in ref.@xcite authors",
    "have developed a chiral expansion theory including vector mesons . in this framework one",
    "can successfully deal with two - vector - meson processes ( one vector meson is in initial state and one is in final state)@xcite .",
    "however , it was also pointed out in ref.@xcite that this framework is failed to study single - vector - meson processes .",
    "so far , the most studies on single - vector - meson processes are still limited at the lowest order of vector meson four - momentum expansion and @xmath2 expansion .",
    "theoretical reason is that convergence of momentum expansion in these processes is unclear , and technical reason is that the calculation beyond the leading order is very difficult .",
    "for example , method of chiral perturbative theory(chpt)@xcite is impractical for these processes because more and more free parameters are required as perturbative order raising .",
    "obviously , this is a serious problem that has to be resolved , since it makes the models calculations being not controlled approximations in that error bars can not be put on the predictions . although there are some attempts to resolve these problem in terms of resumming the momentum expansion at vector meson scale@xcite , the resummation was not yet used in phenomenological studies of vector mesons so far .",
    "the purposes of this present paper are to study chiral expansion in single - vector - meson processes systematically in the framework of chiral quark model , and to overcome the difficulties mentioned in above .",
    "our studies will be not only resumming momentum expansion of vector mesons , but also beyond the leading order of @xmath2 expansion .    the convergence of the chiral expansion is a fundamental requirement for any chiral model . in this paper , a broad class of chiral quark model will be checked by this requirement .",
    "the simplest version of the chiral quark model is in ref.@xcite , that was originated by weinberg@xcite , and has been extended to some different versions@xcite .",
    "the constituent quark model in ref.@xcite is different from other versions in refs.@xcite .",
    "the massless pseudoscalar mesons are treated as fundamental dynamical field degrees of freedom in the former , but are treated as composite fields of quarks in the latter . in section 5 of this paper , we will show that the chiral quark models in refs.@xcite can not yield convergent chiral expansion in single - vector - meson processes , and the effective lagrangian derived from these chiral quark models can not give unitarity s - matrix for vector meson physics .",
    "therefore , in this paper , our studies will be within the framework of a chiral constituent quarks model proposed by manohar and georgi@xcite(quote as mg model hereafter ) .",
    "it is the simplest and practical model for achieving our goal . in view of this model , in energy region between chiral symmetry spontaneously breaking(cssb ) scale(@xmath14gev ) and the confinement scale(@xmath15gev ) , the dynamical field degrees of freedom are constituent quarks(quasi - particle of quarks ) , gluons and goldstone bosons associated with cssb(it is well - known that these goldstone bosons correspond to lowest pseudoscalar octet ) . in this quasiparticle description ,",
    "the effective coupling between gluon and quarks is small and the important interaction is the coupling between quarks and goldstone bosons .",
    "the effective action describing interaction of goldstone bosons can be obtained via integrating out freedoms of quark fields .",
    "the mg model and its extension have been studied continually during the last fifteen years and got great success in different aspects of phenomenological predictions in hadron physics@xcite .",
    "low energy limit of the model has been examined successfully@xcite . in this present paper ,",
    "the mg model will be extended to include lowest vector meson resonances(quote as extended manohar - georgi model or emg model hereafter ) in terms of wccwz realization for spin-1 mesons@xcite .",
    "the advantages of approach of the mg model are that , in principle , high order contribution of the chiral expansion can be computed completely , and only fewer free parameters are required .",
    "so far , however , there are still no any systematic studies beyond the lowest order of the chiral expansion due to technical difficulties . after freedoms of fermions",
    "are integrated out , traditionally , the determinant of dirac operator are regularized by some standard methods , such as schwinger proper time method@xcite , or heat kernel method@xcite , and are expanded in powers of momentum of mesons . in terms of this method ,",
    "the effective action can keep chiral symmetry explicitly order by order .",
    "however , it is very difficult to capture arbitrary order contribution in chiral expansion by means of the above method . in this present paper",
    ", we will propose another equivalent method to evaluate the effective action via calculating one - loop diagrams of constituent quarks directly .",
    "we call it as proper vertex expansion method . by this method , the effective action is expanded in numbers of external vertices instead of external momentum . the effective action with",
    "n external vertices is just connective n - point green function of emg model in presence of external fields .",
    "it includes all order contribution of the momentum expansion .",
    "thus in terms of this method , the chiral theory at vector meson energy scale can be studies up to all orders of the momentum expansion .",
    "another challenging subject is to study vector meson physics beyond large @xmath16 limit . in the other words , how can we calculate meson loops systematically and consistently ? at vector meson energy scale , it can be expected that the contributions from pseudoscalar meson loops play important and highly nontrivial role .",
    "this is due to the following reasons : 1)empirically , for vector meson physics , the contribution from pseudoscalar meson loops is about @xmath17 .",
    "the conclusion is obtained because the width of @xmath10-meson is generated dynamically by pion loops and @xmath18 is suppressed by @xmath2 expansion according to standard @xmath2 argument@xcite .",
    "it indicates that the contribution from pseudoscalar meson loops is not small so that it can not be omitted simply .",
    "2 ) since both pseudoscalar mesons and constituent quarks are fundamental dynamical field degrees of freedoms at this energy scale , theoretically , loop effects of pseudoscalar mesons should be also considered as well when effective action is derived by loop effects of constituent quarks .",
    "3)for physical value @xmath19 , the @xmath2 expansion is not convergent very rapidly .",
    "due to the above reasons , in this paper we will also study contribution from pseudoscalar meson loops systematically",
    ". the calculations on meson loops will suffer ultraviolet(uv ) divergent difficulty . at vector meson energy scale , loop effects of pseudoscalar",
    "mesons cause @xmath20 mixing which will destroy ozi rule@xcite if this contribution is not to be an appropriate value . in the other words",
    ", it can insure ozi rule for @xmath13 to choose an uv cut - off appropriately .",
    "thus , very fortunately , the ozi rule for @xmath13 provides a natural way to determine all uv - dependent contributions in the meson loop calculations .",
    "the unitarity of s - matrix is a fundamental requirement for any quantum field theory .",
    "it is well - known that the unitarity of s - matrix of an effective theory can not be insured in full energy region , but only be insured in energy region below an energy cut - off .",
    "the consistency of this effective theory requires masses of all resonances should be smaller than this cut - off . in the other words",
    ", it indicates that the cut - off @xmath21 in emg model should satisify @xmath22 for su(2 ) and @xmath23 for su(3 ) at least . in general , a low energy effective field theory of qcd",
    "is a well - defined perturbative theory in @xmath2 expansion .",
    "thus the unitarity of s - matrix of low energy effective field theory has to be satisfied in order by order in @xmath2 expansion . for emg model , the unitarity of s - matrix",
    "will be examined explicitly in this paper .",
    "we will see that the meson - loop effects play an essential role for meeting the requirement of the unitarity .",
    "the phenomenology of vector meson physics is very rich .",
    "for example , the vector meson dominance(vmd ) and universal coupling for vector mesons , which are good approximation for vector meson physics@xcite , should be satisfied in the leading order of the chiral expansion . in this present paper",
    ", we will achieve various phenomenological results : 1)the decays for @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "2 ) dynamical width for @xmath10-meson and breit - wigner formula for propagator of resonance .",
    "3 ) @xmath8 mixing and @xmath5 decay .",
    "the mass difference between @xmath10 and @xmath11 are also predicted . we will show that , for resonance particles with large width(e.g . ,",
    "@xmath10 ) , the mass parameter in its propagator is not just the its physics mass .",
    "4)pion form factor and @xmath24 pion - pion phase shift .",
    "some nontrivial phase in pion form factor are revealed too .",
    "5 ) individual light current quark masses at vector meson energy scale .",
    "the quark masses are model - dependent and are necessary to extend our study to @xmath12 and @xmath13 mesons .",
    "6)the anomalous decays @xmath6 and @xmath25 .",
    "all above results resum all information of the momentum expansion of vector mesons and are up to the next to leading order of @xmath2 expansion .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 the manohar - georgi model and its extension are reviewed . in sect .",
    "3 , the relevant effective action is derived at the leading order of @xmath2 expansion .",
    "this effective action includes all order contribution of the chiral expansion in powers of vector meson four - momentum square .",
    "the calculation on pseudoscalar meson loops will be included in the following sections . in sect .",
    "4 , decays for @xmath3 and @xmath26 are studied . in sect .",
    "5 , the unitarity of s - matrix is examined explicitly and breit - wigner formula for @xmath10-propagator is obtained . in sect .",
    "6 , the @xmath8 mixing and @xmath27 decay are studied .",
    "the isospin breaking parameter @xmath28 is predicted at energy scale @xmath29 . in sect .",

    "the light quark masses are predicted in sect .",
    "9 and a brief summary is in sect .",
    "for interpreting physics below cssb scale , manohar and georgi provides a qcd - inspired description on the simple constituent quark model . at chiral limit",
    ", it is parameterized by the following @xmath31 invariant chiral constituent quark lagrangian @xmath32 here @xmath33 denotes trace in su(3 ) flavour space , @xmath34 are constituent quark fields , @xmath35 can be fitted by beta decay of neutron .",

    "the constituent quark fields transform as matter fields of su(3)@xmath50 , @xmath51 @xmath36 is su(3)@xmath50 invariant field gradients and @xmath37 transforms as field connection of su(3)@xmath50 @xmath52 thus the lagrangian (  [ 2.1 ] ) is invariant under @xmath53 .    for achieving the purposes of this present paper , mg model",
    "must be extended to including lowest vector meson resonance and beyond chiral limit . the light quark mass matrix @xmath54 is usually included into external spin-0 fields , i.e. , @xmath55 , where @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are scalar and pseudoscalar external fields respectively .",
    "the chiral transformation for @xmath59 is @xmath60 thus @xmath59 and @xmath61 together with @xmath44 and @xmath62 can form su(3)@xmath63 invariant scalar source @xmath64 pseudoscalar source @xmath65 .",
    "then current quark mass dependent term is written @xmath66 eq .  ( [ 2.19 ] ) will return to standard quark mass term of qcd lagrangian , @xmath67 , in absence of pseudoscalar mesons at high energy for arbitrary @xmath68 .",
    "it means that the symmetry and some underlying constrains of qcd can not fixed the coupling between pseudoscalar mesons and constituent quarks .",
    "hence @xmath68 is treated as an initial parameter of the model and will be fitted phenomenologically .    from the viewpoint of chiral symmetry only , an alternative scheme for incorporating vector mesons",
    "was suggested by weinberg@xcite and developed by callan , coleman et .",
    "al@xcite . in this",
    "treatment , vector meson resonances @xmath69 transform homogeneously under su(3)@xmath63 , @xmath70 where @xmath71 then extended manohar - georgi model(emg model ) is parametered by the following su(3)@xmath50 invariant lagrangian @xmath72 we can see that there are five initial parameters @xmath73 and @xmath74 in emg model .",
    "these parameters can not be determined by symmetry and should be fitted by experiment .",
    "the effective lagrangian describing interaction of vector meson resonances will be generated via loop effects of constituent quarks .",
    "it should carefully distinguish emg model from enjl - like models@xcite which seem to be similar to emg model .",
    "the difference is that there are kinetic term of pseudoscalar mesons in emg model , but this term is absent in enjl - like models .",
    "it makes there is a extra constrain on constituent quark mass @xmath75 in enjl - like models , and this constrain requires constituent quark mass @xmath75 around 300mev .",
    "however , in sect . v we will point out that this value of @xmath75 can not insure convergence of chiral expansion in single - vector - meson processes .",
    "the essential subject of nonperturbative qcd is to obtain a low energy effective action of light hadrons , which belongs to the leading order of @xmath2 expansion . in chiral quark model ,",
    "this effective action is generated via loop effects of quarks , i.e. , integrating over degrees of freedom of quark .",
    "this path integral can be performed explicitly .",
    "the determiant of fermion obtained by path integral are usually regularized by heat kernel method . in this method ,",
    "the effective action is expanded in powers of momentum of mesons .",
    "it is very difficult to use this method to calculate high order contribution of momentum expansion . in this present paper",
    ", we will derive the effective action via computing the feymann diagrams of quark loops directly instead of performing path integral .",
    "we start with constituent quark lagrangian  ( [ 2.22 ] ) , and define vector auxiliary field @xmath76 , axial - vector auxiliary field @xmath77 , scalar auxiliary field @xmath78 and pseudoscalar auxiliary field @xmath79 as follows @xmath80 where @xmath81 are su(3 ) gell - mann matrices and @xmath82 .",
    "then in lagrangian  ( [ 2.22 ] ) , the terms associating with constituent quark fields can be rewritten as follow @xmath83    the effective action describing meson interaction can be obtained via loop effects of constituent quarks @xmath84 where @xmath85 is time - order product of constituent quark fields , @xmath86 is interaction part of lagrangian  ( [ 3.2 ] ) , @xmath87 is one - loop effects of constituent quarks with @xmath88 auxiliary fields , @xmath89 are four - momentas of @xmath88 auxiliary fields respectively and @xmath90 to get rid of all disconnected diagrams , we have @xmath91 obviously , in eq .",
    "( [ 3.6 ] ) the effective action @xmath92 is expanded in powers of number of external vertex and is expressed as integral over external momentum .",

    ", the effective action can be obtained , and in principle it can include all information on resumming momentum expansion . practically , however , it is tedious to express the effective action completely . in this section ,",
    "we only derive those effective action relating to phenomenological studies on @xmath10 and @xmath11 physics in next sections . for simplifying the expression of the effective action , some good approximation will be used .",

    "it is crucial and challenging to prove the unitarity of @xmath166-matrix for low energy effective theories of qcd .",
    "this problem has been solved satisfactorily in this paper .",
    "the unitarity has been proved order by order in @xmath2 expansion .",
    "it yields a strong constrain for all effective theories of low energy qcd , that the transition amplitude must be real at the leading order of @xmath2 expansion .",
    "this constrain can be used to examine whether an effective theory is eligible or not .    in this paper",
    ", we study a number of phenomenological processes successfully .",
    "it should be pointed out that our studies are different from one in all previous literature , since high order contributions of momentum expansion and @xmath2 expansion are included in ours consistently .",
    "some new features are revealed in this papers : 1 ) for wide resonances , the mass parameter in its propagator is in general different from its physical mass",
    ". however , the difference between them is model - dependent . so that the masses of resonances enter effective lagrangian only as a parameters .",
    "their physical masses should be predicted by relevant scattering processes .",
    "2 ) in @xmath5 decay , a nonresonant background is allowed , but the contribution from this back ground is very small .",
    "3 ) there are three nontrivial phases in pion form factor ( fig .",
    "all of these phases are generated by pion loops and are momentum - dependent .",
    "up to the next to leading order of @xmath2 expansion , all results in emg model are factorized by @xmath127 , @xmath97 , @xmath169 , @xmath158=(0.75 , @xmath170 decay of neutron ) , @xmath171 , ksrf ( i ) sum rule ) , @xmath75=(480mev , chiral coupling constant at @xmath147 ) , @xmath172=(0.54 , zweig rule ) and masses of pseudoscalar mesons . so that emg model provides powerful theoretical predictions on low energy meson physics . furthermore , since strange quark mass has been extracted from pseudoscalar meson spectrum , the calculation of this paper can be easily extend to cases including @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "these studies will be found elsewhere .",
