    "in a separate paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereinafter paper i ) , we have performed an extensive analysis of the problem of finding satisfactory calibrations of several relations between different polarimetric parameters and the geometric albedo .",
    "our analysis was based on using for calibration purposes a sample of asteroids for which we have reliable independent estimates of the albedo , based on accurate measurements of their size , reliable estimates of their absolute magnitude , and using the known relation linking the size , geometric albedo and absolute magnitude of an asteroid , namely : @xmath0 [ eqn : dhpv ] where @xmath1 is the diameter expressed in km ( assuming the object is spherical ) , @xmath2 is the absolute magnitude ( in the johnson @xmath3 band by definiton ) and @xmath4 is the geometric albedo ( again , in the johnson @xmath3 band ) .",
    "a list of asteroids suited for the purposes of calibration was published by shevchenko and tedesco ( 2006 ) , hereinafter @xcite . in recent years",
    "we have performed campaigns of polarimetric observations of objects belonging to the @xcite list , in order to obtain for them accurate polarimetric measurements .",
    "paper i presented the results of our analysis of these asteroids . by analyzing the phase -polarization curves of the objects , namely the variation of the linear polarization @xmath5 as a function of the solar phase angle is the degree of linear polarization with a sign that is defined to be positive when the plane of polarization is found to be perpendicular to the sun - observer - target plane ( scattering plane ) , and negative when the plane of polarization is parallel to the scattering plane .",
    "the solar phase angle , herein after referred to simply as the `` phase angle '' , is the angle between the directions to the sun and to the observer , as seen from the target object .",
    "] , we computed a variety of polarimetric parameters that are known to be diagnostic of albedo , including the polarimetric slope @xmath6 and the extreme value of negative polarization @xmath7 ( for an introduction to the basic notions of asteroid polarimetry , that we will not repeat here , see paper i ) .",
    "in addition , we also considered some new polarimetric parameters , including the @xmath8 parameter suggested by @xcite , as well as a new parameter , named @xmath9 , that we introduced in paper i.    in order to derive accurate values of the above polarimetric parameters from available data , in paper i we focused our analysis on asteroids for which we have a good number of polarimetric measurements satisfactorily sampling the phase - polarization curves , and we made use of the following exponential - linear relation to fit the phase - polarization curves of the objects under scrutiny : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the phase angle expressed in degrees , and @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 are parameters whose values have to be determined by means of best - fit techniques .",
    "the above analytical representation has been found in the past to be well suited to fit phase - polarization curves @xcite .",
    "note that this relation does not take into account the possible presence of a polarization surge at very small phase angles .",
    "this effect , found by @xcite and @xcite to be possibly present in the case of a couple of very - high albedo asteroids , ( 64 ) angelina and ( 44 ) nysa , respectively , is rather negligible for the purposes of the present analysis .",
    "we do not analyze angelina because we already did it in paper i. we note also that the available measurements obtained for this object at very small phase angles have error bars too large to be accepted by our severe selection criteria adopted in paper i. in the case of nysa , which is analyzed in the present paper , the few measurements suggesting a surge of negative polarization at phase angles @xmath15 do not seem to produce any important consequence on the overall fit of its phase - polarization curve , although we will see below that this asteroid seems to be rather peculiar in some aspects .    using the exponential - linear relation ,",
    "we were able to find suitable calibrations of several relations between the geometric albedo and polarimetric parameters , generally described in the form : @xmath16 where @xmath4 is the geometric albedo in @xmath3 light and @xmath17 is one of several possible polarimetric parameters characterizing the morphology of available phase - polarization curves .    in paper",
    "i , that was exclusively focused on the issue of the calibration of different albedo - polarization relations , we analyzed @xmath18 asteroids belonging to the @xcite list .",
    "however , we could also compute the most relevant polarimetric parameters for a larger number of other asteroids , not included in the above - mentioned list , because they were not suitable for the specific purposes of paper i. in this paper , we present our results for the remaining objects .",
    "in particular , we consider all available polarimetric data , taken from different sources , including the pds , and recent papers @xcite . for each object",
    "we computed different estimates of the albedos using the same methods used in paper i.    moreover , in the present paper we also present a more extensive analysis of the distribution of different polarimetric parameters among the asteroid population , using all available data , and we also analyze some interesting relations between different polarimetric parameters .",
    "this was beyond the scope of the analysis performed in paper i , but we investigate now such relations , including some that in the past were considered to be directly diagnostic of surface properties , including the typical sizes of regolith particles .",
    "in paper i ( tables 2 , 3 , and 5 ) we listed a summary of several polarimetric parameters and corresponding albedo values obtained for @xmath18 objects from @xcite .",
    "these asteroids , for which we made an effort to obtain new polarimetric meaurements , were chosen for the purposes of calibration of different possible albedo - polarization relations . here",
    "we consider an additional set of @xmath19 asteroids that are not included in @xcite .",
    "these asteroids were chosen from those that , in our judgment , have phase - polarization data of sufficiently good quality to derive the major polarimetric parameters with an accuracy high enough for use in the present study . in terms of requirements concerning data quality and coverage of the phase - polarization curves",
    ", we made our selection using the same criteria already adopted and described in paper i.    table 1 shows for these objects the polarimetric slope @xmath6 , resulting from the computation of a simple linear fit of a minimum of five @xmath5 measurements obtained at phase angles larger than @xmath20 , as well as some other parameters considered in paper i. apart from @xmath6 , these parameters were obtained from fitting an exponential - linear fit ( eq.@xmath21[eqn : abc ] ) to the whole phase - polarization curves .",
    "these parameters include another independent estimate of the polarimetric slope , that we called @xmath22 , obtained as the first derivative of the exponential - linear curve computed at the inversion angle @xmath23 ; the extreme value of negative polarization @xmath7 ; the @xmath9 parameter introduced in paper i ( defined as the difference between the values of @xmath5 formally corresponding to phase angles of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively , according to the best - fit of eq.@xmath21[eqn : abc ] ) , and the @xmath8 parameter defined by @xcite .",
    "the low associated uncertainty of the inversion angle @xmath23 comes also from the best - fit of the exponential - linear relation described in paper i.    [ tab : tab1 ]    [ cols=\">,>,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the difference between the polarization slopes @xmath6 and @xmath22 consists only in the way they are computed . in paper",
    "i , we showed that the use of @xmath6 or @xmath22 gives very similar solutions , apart from marginally better rms deviations in the case of using @xmath6 .",
    "so , in practical situations the use of either @xmath6 or @xmath22 is mainly dictated by the available polarimetric data .",
    "it is important to note that in paper i we considered two kinds of calibration of the slope - albedo and @xmath7 - albedo relations .",
    "the first was obtained by fitting all data available for all the objects of our dataset .",
    "the second was obtained by removing from the analysis asteroids that according to @xcite have albedos lower than @xmath26 .",
    "this was suggested by the evidence that the slope - albedo and ( even more ) the @xmath7 - albedo relation tend to saturate at low - albedo .",
    "we showed that the linear best - fit solutions obtained by exluding low - albedo asteroids from the analysis give smaller rms deviations of the data , and should therefore be preferred , but only in narrower intervals of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , because at values of @xmath27%/@xmath28 and @xmath7 deeper than @xmath29% , there is an unsolvable ambiguity between objects of quite different albedo , but sharing the same values of @xmath6 ( or @xmath22 ) and @xmath7 .",
    "we found also that the slope - albedo relation calibrated against asteroids of all albedos can still be used to derive a decent albedo estimate for any object , whereas the use of the @xmath7 - albedo relation calibrated against asteroids of all albedos should not be used , since the resulting errors on the derived albedos are exceedingly high .    in table 2",
    "we list the albedo values obtained from the values of different polarimetric parameters considered in paper i. we give , whenever possible , two values of albedo obtained from the @xmath6 slope , one corresponding to the calibration of the slope - albedo relation using all calibration asteroids considered in paper i , and one corresponding to the calibration obtained considering only the objects having albedo larger than @xmath26 .",
    "the latter albedo value is given only for asteroids having @xmath30 .",
    "as for the albedo computed using @xmath7 , we use only the calibration obtained in paper i for asteroids having albedo larger than @xmath26 , and we list the corresponding albedo only for asteroids having @xmath7 not reaching @xmath31% . in so doing ,",
    "we are following our own recommendations as explained in paper i. in the case of @xmath22 and @xmath9 , the resulting albedo values given in table 2 are based on the whole set of calibration asteroids , including also low - albedo objects . in paper i",
    "we showed that in the case of @xmath9-based albedos , the resulting values are generally very reliable . in the case of @xmath22 , however , it should be better to exclude from the calibration the asteroids having albedo smaller than @xmath26 ( as in the case of @xmath6 just mentioned ) .",
    "the albedo values listed in table 2 corresponding to @xmath22 must therefore be taken with some caveat , since some overestimation of albedos , specially for high - albedo objects , is likely present .",
    "[ eqn : abc]).,width=332 ]    from table 2 , we can see that most albedo values are obtained from computation of the @xmath22 and @xmath9 polarimetric parameters , obtained from a fit of the phase - polarization curve using eq.@xmath21[eqn : abc ] .",
    "in general , the agreement among the albedos obtained using different polarimetric parameters is quite good .",
    "this confirms that , depending on the available data , reliable albedo values can be obtained even from a fairly small number of polarimetric measurements .",
    "the best polarimetric parameter to be used depends case by case upon the available data , and we have outlined in paper i how to proceed in practical situations .",
    "the albedo values obtained from the @xmath9 parameter tend to vary in a more limited interval with respect to what we find using other polarimetric parameters .",
    "this is particularly true for the highest - albedo objects , ( 44 ) nysa , ( 214 ) aschera , and ( 2867 ) steins , included in our sample .",
    "these asteroids belong to the old @xmath32-class defined by tholen @xcite ; in the more recent classification by @xcite they are classified as @xmath33 .",
    "there is some problem concerning in particular ( 44 ) nysa .",
    "as shown in table 2 , we find extremely high values , up to @xmath34 or even above , using the slope - albedo relation calibrated against all asteroids considered in paper i , regardless of their albedo . by using calibrations obtained by dropping low - albedo asteroids",
    ", the resulting albedo tends to decrease down to @xmath35 .",
    "this was one of the main reasons in paper i to compute alternative calibrations based on the exclusion of the darkest calibration objects . in the case of the @xmath36 - albedo relation ,",
    "we obtain for nysa a still high value around @xmath37 . a slightly more moderate value , around @xmath38 , is found using the @xmath9 parameter .",
    "the extremely shallow polarimetric slope of nysa is shown in fig.@xmath39[fig : nysa ] . in this figure ,",
    "note also the very low value of the phase angle corresponding to @xmath7 .",
    "the albedos of ( 214 ) aschera and ( 2867 ) steins , turn out to be much lower than in the case of ( 44 ) nysa .",
    "also for another @xmath32-class asteroid , ( 434 ) hungaria , that is now classified as @xmath40 by @xcite , we find a much more moderate albedo value , slightly above @xmath41 .",
    "in general terms , @xmath32-class asteroids are those for which the choice of the polarimetric parameter chosen to derive the albedo makes the most difference , and for which it is highly recommended to use calibrations of the polarimetric slope and of @xmath7 that are computed by excluding low - albedo objects from the computation . in other words , albedo values in columns 2 and 4 of table 2 should not be used for @xmath32-class objects . in this way , with the notable exception of ( 44 ) nysa , the albedo values obtained are generally in reasonable mutual agreement , ranging approximately between @xmath41 and @xmath42 , a range that one might expect corresponds to a real variation among the objects of this class .",
    "it is also interesting to note in table 2 the high albedo values found for the @xmath12-class asteroid ( 863 ) benkoela , ranging from @xmath41 to @xmath38 , depending on the adopted polarimetric parameter .",
    "this is the only example of @xmath12-class objects in our sample .",
    "further observations of other members of this fairly rare class , which is thought to have a composition dominated by olivine , are needed to confirm this preliminary result .",
    "when looking at the data displayed in table 2 , one should take into account that this table lists also a number of so - called barbarian objects , which are known to exhibit peculiar polarimetric properties , and in particular a very wide width of the negative polarization branch , up to about @xmath24 in phase @xcite .",
    "for these objects , it is likely that the peculiar morphology of the phase - polarization curve can prevent us from deriving the albedo using the same polarimetric parameters developed for normal asteroids .",
    "asteroids ( 234 ) barbara ( the prototype of the barbarian class ) , ( 172 ) baucis , ( 236 ) honoria , ( 387 ) aquitania and ( 980 ) anacostia , included in table 2 , are all barbarians . for them , we see significant differences in the albedo values derived using different polarimetric parameters . the albedos derived using the @xmath9 parameter , tend to have values around @xmath43 , whereas in the case of using @xmath22 the corresponding value tends to be around @xmath44 . in both cases , ( 980 )",
    "anacostia seems to have a higher albedo than the other barbarians in our sample .    if we exclude barbarians , we see that the albedo values derived using different parameters show a remarkable consistency .",
    "we conclude therefore that it may be risky to try and derive albedos for barbarian objects using the conventional polarimetric parameters , due to their unusual polarimetric behaviour .",
    "the situation is much more promising for the vast majority of `` normal '' asteroids .",
    "the availability of a data set of phase - polarization curves of sufficiently good quality to obtain best - fit representations using the exponential - linear relation also allows us to make some updated investigations of the polarimetric behavior of different classes of asteroids , not limited to the determination of the geometric albedo .     for all asteroids considered in this paper and in paper i.,width=332 ]    [ eqn : abc]).,width=332 ]     for all asteroids",
    "conidered in this paper and in paper i.,width=332 ]    in particular , we can analyze the distributions of the inversion angle @xmath45 , and of the phase angle corresponding to @xmath7 , as shown in fig.@xmath21[fig : istalfinv ] and [ fig : istphasepmin ] , respectively .",
    "since the early days of asteroid polarimetry it has been known that the inversion angle occurs at phase angles close to @xmath46 . in recent years , however , some important exceptions have been found , as shown in fig.@xmath21[fig : istalfinv ] . by looking at the low - end distribution of @xmath45",
    ", there are two objects characterized by an inversion angle around @xmath20 . in the case of asteroid ( 14 ) irene",
    ", we can not draw any conclusion because its phase - polarization curve is not of a very good quality and new observations are needed to better understand its true behaviour .",
    "the case of ( 419 ) aurelia , conversely , is much more interesting .",
    "this asteroid belongs to the old @xmath47 taxonomic class identified by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "( 419 ) aurelia is no longer identified as an @xmath47 class in more recent taxonomic classifications based on reflectance spectra that no longer cover the blue part of the spectrum .",
    "asteroids previously classified as @xmath47 are now included in the modern @xmath13 class @xcite .",
    "we know , however , that the original @xmath47-class asteroids can be distinguished based on their polarimetric properties . in particular ,",
    "these asteroids are characterized by small values of @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "in addition to aurelia , three other @xmath47-class asteroids in our sample show low values of @xmath45 , around @xmath48 .",
    "they are ( 335 ) roberta , ( 704 ) interamnia ( analyzed in paper i ) , and ( 1021 ) flammario , although in the case of flammario the available polarimetric data are noisy . the excellent phase - polarization curve of ( 704 ) interamnia , one of the calibration asteroids used in paper i , is shown here in fig.@xmath21[fig : interamnia ] .",
    "in addition to the above - mentioned @xmath47-class asteroids , another asteroid , ( 214 ) aschera , exhibits an inversion angle of about @xmath49 . this is a very high - albedo asteroid , and its properties will be discussed below .",
    "a few other objects exhibit relatively low values of @xmath45 around @xmath50 .",
    "we have seen , however , that for them we still need additional observations to better cbaracterize their phase - polarization curves .    at the other end of the distribution of @xmath45 , we see some objects characterized by values well above @xmath46 . these are the barbarian asteroids already mentioned above .",
    "four of them , ( 172 ) baucis , ( 234 ) barbara , ( 387 ) aquitania , and ( 980 ) anacostia have inversion angles above @xmath51 .",
    "( 236 ) honoria and ( 679 ) pax have slightly lower inversion angles around @xmath52 .",
    "the single object exhibiting an inversion angle of about @xmath53 is ( 21 ) lutetia .",
    "this object is one of the two asteroids observed by the rosetta probe ( the other being ( 2867 ) steins , also included in our tables ) .",
    "lutetia has fairly unusual properties .",
    "it was classified in the past as an @xmath54-class , possibly metal - rich , asteroid @xcite , but the observations performed before and during the rosetta fly - by , using different techniques , have shown that the composition of this asteroid seems to be more compatible with that of some classes of primitive meteorites @xcite .",
    "the high value of the inversion angle of ( 21 ) lutetia confirms that the surface of this asteroid is unusual .",
    "the distribution of the inversion angle of polarization among asteroids appears to be today much wider and interesting than in the past .",
    "the @xmath45 parameter appears to be useful to distinguish classes of asteroids with unusual surface properties . in the case of barbarians , there are reasons to believe that these objects might be the remnants of the first generation of planetesimals accreted in the first few @xmath55 years of our solar system s history ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . in the case of objects exhibiting small values of @xmath45",
    ", it is interesting to note that this property , typical of asteroids belonging to the old @xmath47 class of @xcite , has been found to be shared also by a few cometary nuclei @xcite .",
    "this interesting result tends to strengthen other pieces of evidence of a possible link between @xmath47-class asteroids and comets , already suggested by the fact that comet wilson hurrington was first discovered as an asteroid ( numbered 4015 ) , classified as @xmath56 and another @xmath47-class asteroid , ( 3200 ) phaeton , is known to be the source of the geminid meteors ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "perfectly overlap in this plot .",
    "the solid curve is the best - fit curve using the exponential - linear representation ( eq.@xmath39[eqn : abc]).,width=332 ]    the distribution of the phase angle corresponding to @xmath7 , @xmath57 , is shown in fig.@xmath39[fig : istphasepmin ] .",
    "we see a confirmation of the fact that @xmath7 is mostly found at phase angles between @xmath58 and @xmath25 .",
    "a few exceptions exist , however .",
    "we find four asteroids having @xmath57 between @xmath59 and @xmath60 , namely ( 44 ) nysa , ( 71 ) niobe , ( 214 ) aschera and ( 2867 ) steins .",
    "we have already seen that ( 44 ) , ( 214 ) and ( 2867 ) are high - albedo asteroids belonging to the old @xmath32-class . as for ( 71 ) niobe ,",
    "it is classified as @xmath40 by @xcite .",
    "its albedo , according to our results listed in table 2 , is high , though not as extreme as those of nysa , aschera , and steins .",
    "its phase - polarization curve , however , does not include data at phase angles less than about @xmath58 , so the formal value of @xmath57 listed in table 1 for this asteroid is still very uncertain , and could be considerably wrong",
    ". it seems , anyway , that a very low value of @xmath57 can be a common feature among high - albedo asteroids , although some of them , like the @xmath40-class ( 434 ) phocaea and the @xmath12-class ( 863 ) benkoela do not share this property .",
    "it is possible that for the highest - albedo asteroids , having very shallow polarimetric slopes , determination of the inversion angle and the phase angle of @xmath7 might turn out to be more uncertain than the results presented here .",
    "we have already seen in fig.@xmath21[fig : nysa ] , however , that the low value of @xmath57 for ( 44 ) nysa , seems well defined , and does not appear to be affected by a possible polarization opposition effect .",
    "though not so densely sampled , the same can be seen for the phase - polarization curve of ( 214 ) aschera , shown in fig.@xmath21[fig : aschera ] .",
    "we note that very low values of @xmath57 are known also for two centaur objects , ( 2060 ) chiron and ( 10199 ) chariklo , and for the tno object ( 5145 ) pholus @xcite .",
    "a fundamental difference with respect to high - albedo asteroids is that for objects at high heliocentric distances @xmath7 is much deeper , and suggests low - albedo surfaces . at the other end of the @xmath57 distribution , there are five asteroids having phase angle of @xmath7 between @xmath61 and @xmath20 .",
    "these are the five barbarian asteroids discussed above . having a very wide negative polarization branch , it is not too surprising that these objects tend also to have @xmath7 at larger phase angles than usual , and this feature might be related to the same surface properties that determine the wide negative polarization branch .",
    "we note , however , that ( 21 ) lutetia , which also exhibits a large value of the inversion angle , is a perfectly normal asteroid as far as @xmath57 is concerned .",
    "polarimetric slope _ versus _ phase angle of @xmath7 for the whole sample of asteroids considered in tables 1 and 2 and paper i. note that higher values of @xmath22 correspond to lower values of albedo .",
    "objects having fewer than @xmath62 polarimetric measurements are indicated by open , green symbols.,width=332 ]     polarimetric slope _ versus _ inversion angle @xmath23 for the whole sample of asteroids considered in table 1 and paper i. asteroids for which we have fewer than @xmath62 polarimetric measurements are indicated by open , green symbols.,width=332 ]",
    "in fig.@xmath39[fig : alfpminhabcall ] we present an @xmath57 - @xmath22 plot for all the asteroids considered in this paper ( table 1 ) and including also those considered in paper i. the meaning of this figure is clear if we consider that the polarimetric slope ( @xmath6 , or , as in this case , @xmath22 , to consider a larger number of objects ) is diagnostic of the albedo .",
    "in particular , low - albedo asteroids have higher values of @xmath22 , and _ viceversa_.    from the figure , we see that the objects tend to split into two groups , characterized by different average values of slope ( i.e. , albedo ) .",
    "this is expected considering that the main belt population is dominated by two superclasses , namely the moderate - albedo @xmath63-class , and the low - albedo @xmath14-class .    in the lower part of the plot shown in fig.@xmath39[fig : alfpminhabcall ] ,",
    "corresponding to moderate to high - albedo objects , we see a general trend of decreasing albedo for increasing @xmath57 .",
    "a similar trend , but slightly less pronounced , may be seen also in the upper part of the plot .",
    "low - albedo objects ( having higher values of the polarimetric slope @xmath22 ) , tend to display values of @xmath57 which look more confined .",
    "asteroids having @xmath57 below @xmath64 are found only among high - albedo objects , as already seen in section@xmath21[distributions ] .",
    "most asteroids in fig.@xmath39[fig : alfpminhabcall ] are located in the region between about @xmath58 and @xmath25 of @xmath65 .",
    "the right part of the plot is occupied by barbarian asteroids , which tend to cluster at values of @xmath22 intermediate between those of low- and high - albedo objects .    in fig.@xmath39[fig : alfinvhabcall ] we show a plot of the @xmath22 polarimetric slope _ versus _ the inversion angle @xmath45 .",
    "again , we can see a clear splitting between low - albedo asteroids and the rest of the population . in both groups",
    ", there is a trend for an increase of @xmath22 ( equivalent to a decrease of the albedo ) for increasing @xmath45 .",
    "this behaviour is possibly less sharp among low - albedo objects , and @xmath47-class asteroids clearly do not follow this trend , with ( 419 ) aurelia occupying the most extreme top - left location in the plot .",
    "all asteroids , independent of their albedo , tend to share the same interval of inversion angles , except for the barbarians , which occupy the high - end of the @xmath45 range .",
    "interesting enough , the location of the barbarians in this plot tends to correspond to an extrapolation towards larger values of @xmath45 of the relation between @xmath45 and @xmath22 exhibited by intermediate to high - albedo asteroids .",
    "we note again also the location of ( 21 ) lutetia , that with an @xmath45 angle of @xmath53 , lies in between barbarians and `` normal '' asteroids .",
    "figs.@xmath21[fig : alfpminhabcall ] and [ fig : alfinvhabcall ] suggest a correlation between inversion angle and phase angle of @xmath7 which is clearly shown in fig.@xmath21[fig : alfpminalfinvall ] .",
    "such a correlation , which may look straightforward , has not been explored much in the past .",
    "we note that this correlation is present for all but a few objects located at low values of @xmath45 and @xmath57 ( one of them being ( 44 ) nysa ) , and that the location of the barbarians corresponds to the extrapolation of the linear trend exhibited by `` normal '' asteroids .",
    "the interpretation of the features discussed so far is not immediately obvious , but we believe this could be a useful input for current models of light scattering from rocky and/or icy planetary surfaces .     inversion angle _ versus _ phase angle of @xmath7 for the whole sample of asteroids considered in table 1 and paper i. objects having fewer than @xmath62 polarimetric measurements are indicated by open , green symbols.,width=332 ]     _ versus _ inversion angle @xmath23 for the whole sample of asteroids listed in this paper and in paper i. objects having albedo values determined by @xcite are plotted in color .",
    "different colors correspond to different intervals of albedo , as specified in the figure.,width=332 ]    finally , we show in fig.@xmath21[fig : pmininv ] the relation between @xmath45 and @xmath66 .",
    "this is a classical relation analyzed in the past by different authors to derive information on the likely properties of the particles which typically form the surface regolith of the asteroids ( for a classical review , see * ? ? ?",
    "again , our analysis includes not only the objects listed in table 1 , but also the @xmath18 asteroids included in the @xcite list that we considered in paper i. in fig.@xmath21[fig : pmininv ] the objects for which we have an albedo value given by @xcite are indicated by color symbols , using different colors for different albedo classes .    figure [ fig : pmininv ] can be considered as an updated version of the analogous figure shown by @xcite in the _ asteroids ii _ book .",
    "we note that @xcite showed that asteroid data in the @xmath7 - @xmath23 plane are found in a domain which is intermediate between one occupied by coarse rocks and one occupied by very thin lunar fines composed of particles smaller than @xmath67 @xmath68 m , according to laboratory measurements .",
    "we confirm that most asteroids of our sample occupy the region already found by @xcite .",
    "asteroids of increasingly higher albedo tend to occupy regions at the top of the asteroid domain , but there is some mixing at low albedo values , with some objects having small @xcite albedos , below @xmath69 , which are found in this plot mixed with asteroids having albedos larger than @xmath70 .",
    "one of the mixed objects is ( 2 ) pallas , with its albedo of @xmath71 according to @xcite , an unexpected value for an object belonging to the @xmath13-class , as discussed in paper i.    the major difference with respect to the classical results by @xcite , however , is the presence of some objects which are located well outside the typical domain of asteroids , which are found much closer to or within the domain found by @xcite for very pulverized material .",
    "these asteroids are barbarians : ( 234 ) barbara , ( 172 ) baucis , ( 387 ) aquitania and ( 980 ) anacostia , which all have inversion angles above @xmath51 , and ( 236 ) honoria , with an inversion angle above @xmath72 .",
    "these objects occupy clearly anomalous locations in fig.@xmath39[fig : pmininv ] .",
    "another object with a relatively high value of the inversion angle ( @xmath53 ) in fig.@xmath39[fig : pmininv ] is ( 21 ) lutetia . with a @xmath7 value of about @xmath73",
    ", this asteroid would also be located in the domain of very pulverized rocks and lunar fines , according to @xcite .",
    "observations carried out from the ground and by the rosetta probe during its fly - by of lutetia have already provided evidence that this asteroid is unusual in several respects .",
    "it is encouraging , however , to mention that , according to @xcite , the thermal inertia of lutetia is quite low , in very good agreement with the hypothesis that its surface could be rich in fine dust .",
    "any further attempt of interpretation , however , must be postponed to future investigations .",
    "the results of an extensive analysis of available asteroid polarimetric data , carried out in this paper and in paper i , confirm that the study of the polarimetric properties of these objects is extremely interesting and a powerful tool for their physical characterization .",
    "several results shown in the previous sections deserve further studies mainly on the theoretical side , because we now have a wealth of information to test and extend current models of light - scattering phenomena . in particular , we find that some features of the negative polarization branch of phase - polarization curves ( distributions of @xmath45 and @xmath57 and the mutual relation between these parameters ) are particularly interesting .",
    "the location of barbarian asteroids in the @xmath7 - @xmath74 plane suggests that their surfaces are covered by extremely fine dust particles .    in this paper and paper i we give albedo values obtained from polarimetric parameters for a data - set of @xmath75 asteroids .",
    "this data - set will hopefully increase rapidly in the years to come , as an effect of new campaigns of polarimetric observations .",
    "some problems are certainly still open , including the apparently very high albedo of asteroid ( 44 ) nysa .",
    "this is not atypical , as in general , high - albedo , @xmath32-class asteroids tend to display a rather large variation of albedo , depending on the choice of the polarimetric parameter adopted to obtain it .",
    "this implies that the calibration of the relation between geometric albedo and polarization parameters could yet see some further improvement .",
    "we expect progress in the field to come in the near future from different directions",
    ". one possible development would be a systematic use of spectro - polarimetry .",
    "this will allow observers to profit from the results from spectroscopy and polarimetry , separately , plus the product of this merging of two separate techniques , namely the study of the variation of the linear polarization as a function of wavelength .",
    "pioneering work in this respect has been already done by @xcite using broad - band polarimetric data obtained in different colours , while some of us have recently started a systematic campaign of spectro - polarimetric observations of asteroids at the vlt and wht telescopes which has already provided encouraging results @xcite .",
    "finally , another essential input is provided by the _ in situ _ observations of the asteroid ( 4 ) vesta performed by the dawn spacecraft .",
    "vesta is the only asteroid for which a clear variation of the degree of linear polarization as a function of rotation has been convincingly demonstrated ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "some of us have recently carried out an extensive analysis of available `` polarimetric lightcurve '' data of ( 4 ) vesta , by computing the location of the sub - earth point on vesta at the epoch of different , ground - based polarimetric observations , in order to understand the relations with the varying , average properties of the surface seen by ground - based observers at different epochs , and to look for possible correlations with the albedo , topography and composition @xcite . in this study we provided the first example of `` ground - truth '' in asteroid polarimetry .",
