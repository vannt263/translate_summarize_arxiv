    "since the discovery of quasicrystals in 1984  @xcite , quasiperiodic tilings ( such as penrose tilings ) and random rhombus tilings  @xcite have been extensively studied as paradigms of quasicrystal structure .",
    "quasicrystals are metallic alloys exhibiting exotic symmetries that are forbidden by usual crystallographic rules : octagonal , decagonal , dodecagonal or icosahedral symmetries .",
    "nonetheless , the existence of sharp bragg peaks in their diffraction patterns demonstrates a long - range translational and orientational order . as compared to _ perfect _ quasiperiodic tilings , specific degrees of freedom called `` phason flips '' are active in _ random _ tilings . despite their random character , the latter still display the required long - range quasiperiodic structure .",
    "when tiles are appropriately decorated with atoms , random tilings become excellent candidates for modeling real quasicrystalline materials  @xcite . therefore the statistical mechanics of random tilings",
    "is of fundamental interest for quasicrystal science . in particular",
    ", the configurational entropy of their phason fluctuations contributes to the free energy of quasicrystal , and might be a key ingredient in order to understand quasicrystal stability  @xcite .    in parallel , random tilings have become an active field of research in discrete mathematics and computer science ( see  @xcite for instance ) , and many challenging questions remain open for investigation in this field .",
    "the relation between random tilings and integer partitions provides an important tool for the calculation of random tilings entropy  @xcite .",
    "integer partitions are arrays of integers , together with suitable inequalities between these integers .",
    "one - to - one correspondences can be established between integer partitions and tilings of rhombi filling specified polyhedra .",
    "however , it seems that such strictly controlled `` fixed '' boundary conditions inflict a non - trivial macroscopic effect on random tilings  @xcite , even in the thermodynamic limit , lowering the entropy per tile below the entropy with free or periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this effect _ a priori _ makes difficult a calculation of free - boundary entropies _ via _ the partition method .",
    "this boundary sensitivity is well described , for the simple case of hexagonal tilings  @xcite , in terms of a spectacular effect known as the `` arctic circle phenomenon '' : the constraint imposed by the boundary effectively freezes macroscopic regions near the boundary , where the tiling is periodic and has a vanishing entropy density . outside these `` frozen '' regions the entropy density is finite and we call the tiling `` unfrozen '' .",
    "the boundary of the unfrozen region appears to be a perfect circle inscribed in the hexagonal boundary .",
    "the entropy density varies smoothly within the unfrozen region , reaching a maximum equal to the free boundary entropy density at the center .",
    "this quantitative result has never been generalized to higher dimension or codimension tilings , because its generalization requires the knowledge of the free boundary entropy if one wants to use the same proof as in the hexagonal case .",
    "however , thanks to numerical simulations , it has recently been conjectured by linde , moore , nordhal  @xcite that in dimensions higher than 2 , the corresponding arctic region should be a polytope itself , with flat boundaries .",
    "it was further conjectured ( by destainville and mosseri  @xcite and independently by propp  @xcite ) that in this case the entropy density should be spatially uniform and maximal in the unfrozen region .",
    "these conjectures renew the interest for the partition method since the relation between both entropies becomes amazingly simple in this case .",
    "on the other hand , except an early ansatz  @xcite and some exact numerical results for small tilings  @xcite ( up to about 300 tiles ) , almost nothing is known about the entropy of codimension - one tilings of dimension larger than 2 .",
    "note also that some numerical monte carlo simulations provided an estimate of the entropy of ( codimension 3 ) 3-dimensional random tilings with icosahedral symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the present paper is devoted to a numerical investigation of codimension - one three - dimensional tilings .",
    "thanks to a powerful transition matrix monte carlo algorithm , we achieve precise estimates of both fixed- and free - boundary entropies . the latter is calculated via a modified partition method , which produces tilings with fixed boundaries that do not impose any strain to the tilings , thus generalizing a former two - dimensional approach  @xcite .",
    "comparing both entropies , we support the above conjecture with good confidence .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section  [ ptbc ] reviews the relation between random tilings and integer partitions , introduces the different boundary conditions considered in this paper , and describes the arctic region phenomenon conjecture .",
    "section  [ mc ] describes our monte carlo method and our numerical results .",
    "discussions and conclusions are displayed in the last section .",
    "in this paper we consider three - dimensional tilings of rhombohedra which tile a region of euclidean space without gaps or overlaps .",
    "a standard method  @xcite to generate tilings of rhombohedra ( or of rhombi in two dimensions ) consists of selecting sites and tiles in a @xmath1-dimensional cubic lattice , then projecting them into a @xmath2-dimensional subspace with @xmath3 .",
    "the difference @xmath4 is called the codimension of the tilings .",
    "the class of symmetry of a tiling is determined by both its dimension and its codimension and we denote tilings with such a symmetry by @xmath5 tilings .",
    "we consider in this paper codimension - one , three - dimensional random tilings ( i.e. @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) .",
    "these @xmath8 tilings are composed of four different rhombohedra .",
    "all rhombohedra have identical shapes but they occur in four possible different orientations . each rhombohedron is the projections of one of the four different three - dimensional faces of a four - dimensional hypercube",
    ". the interested reader can refer to [ @xcite ] for a review on codimension - one tilings .",
    "the correspondence between codimension - one tilings and _ solid partitions _ , a reformulation of the cut - and - project method , is analyzed in detail in reference [ @xcite ] , and generalized to higher codimensions in reference [ @xcite ] .",
    "we now define three - dimensional solid partitions .",
    "consider a three - dimensional array of sides @xmath9 .",
    "fix an integer @xmath10 , called the _",
    "height _ of the partition problem . put non - negative integers in the array , no larger than @xmath11 , with the constraint that these integers decrease in each of the three directions of space .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are indices attached to the boxes of the array ( @xmath15 ) , we denote by @xmath16 the integral variables attached to these boxes ( the _ parts _ ) .",
    "our partition array contains @xmath17 parts .",
    "the partition constraint is @xmath18 and @xmath19 whenever @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "figure  [ mapping32 ] displays the tiling / partition correspondence in two dimensions for easy visualization .",
    "plane partitions are @xmath23 arrays of non - negative integers smaller than a _ height _ @xmath11 and decreasing in each row and column ( left ) .",
    "this correspondence is constructed as follows : stack 3-dimensional cubes above the boxes of the partition so that the height of each stack ( center ) equals the value of the corresponding partition box ( left ) .",
    "then project this stacking along the ( 1,1,1 ) direction of the cubic lattice .",
    "faces of the cubes project to rhombi .",
    "the so - obtained rhombus tiling fills a hexagon of sides @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath11 ( center ) .",
    "following the same construction in three dimensions , four - dimensional hypercubes are stacked above the three - dimensional partition array , with the heights of the stacks equal to the corresponding parts .",
    "then project into three dimensions along the ( 1,1,1,1 ) direction of the hypercubic lattice .",
    "like in the hexagonal case , the so - obtained tilings fill a polyhedron , a `` rhombic dodecahedron '' ( @xmath26 ) of integral sides @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath11 ( see the outer frame in figure  [ octa ] ) . the total number of tiles , @xmath30 we call tilings with rhombic dodecahedron boundaries `` @xmath31-tilings '' and denote their configurational entropy per tile  @xcite by @xmath32 .    the source of configurational entropy can be easily understood in either the tiling or the partition representation .",
    "figure  [ flip ] illustrates the basic `` tile flip '' in both the @xmath33 and the @xmath34 tilings . in each case",
    "interior tiles are rearranged without disturbing the surface of a region . in terms of the equivalent partition ,",
    "the height of one partition element increases or decreases by one unit .",
    "this elementary local move is ergodic , and every legal tiling can be reached by a succession of such flips ."
