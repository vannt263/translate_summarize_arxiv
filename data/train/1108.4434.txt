    "the discovery of fe - k line emission in galaxy clusters ( mitchell 1976 ; serlemitsos 1977 ) showed that their x - ray emitting intracluster medium ( icm ) contains significant amounts of processed elements created by supernovae .",
    "different types of supernovae synthesize different ratios of elements .",
    "in particular , type ia supernovae ( @xmath3 ) produce large amounts of fe and ni .",
    "meanwhile , core - collapse supernovae ( @xmath4 ) produce lighter elements such as o , ne and mg .",
    "si - group elements ( si , s , ar , and ca ) are produced by both supernova types . by measuring specific elemental abundances within the icm , we can separate the relative contributions to the chemical enrichment by different types of supernovae ( werner 2008 ; bhringer & werner 2010 and references therein ) . such measurements place important constraints on models of supernova explosions ( dupke & white 2000 ; de plaa 2007 ; simionescu 2009 ) .    previous results for clusters and groups pointed to a centrally peaked fe abundance distribution , coupled with a relatively flat o abundance profile , in cool core systems .",
    "based on such measurements , it was proposed that the relative contribution of @xmath3 to the enrichment of clusters increases towards their central regions ( finoguenov 2000 ; bhringer 2001 ; tamura 2001 ; finoguenov 2002 ; matsushita 2003 ) . the central fe abundance peaks in cool core clusters",
    "were expected to form primarily by @xmath3 with long delay times , as well as stellar mass loss in the cd galaxies ( bhringer 2004 ; de grandi 2004 ) .",
    "@xmath5 products such as o , ne , and mg were , on the other hand , produced early in the formation history of clusters at @xmath63 and were thought to be well mixed throughout the icm . because @xmath5 also produce large amounts of si and s , this scenario predicts shallower central gradients for the distributions of si and s than for fe , resulting in si / fe and s / fe ratios that increase with radius .",
    "the predicted si / fe gradient has , however , not been seen and the observed radial profiles of the si / fe ratios are in most clusters consistent with being flat , indicating that si is just as peaked as fe ( bhringer 2001 ; finoguenov 2002 ; tamura 2004 ; sanders 2004 ; durret 2005 ; de plaa 2006 ; werner 2006a ; sato 2007 , 2008 ; matsushita 2007 ) . moreover , contrary to previous claims , simionescu ( 2009 ) show that in hydra a and in a sample of other nearby clusters of galaxies the o abundance is also centrally peaked .",
    "the observed centrally peaked distribution of @xmath5 products suggests that the metallicity gradients form early in the history of clusters and persist for a long time , or that the enrichment by the winds of the evolved stellar population is significantly more efficient than previously thought ( simionescu 2009 ) .",
    "centrally peaked @xmath5 products are also observed in the core of the centaurus cluster and have been interpreted as being either due to continuous or intermittent star formation over the past @xmath08 gyr , or due to the early enrichment during the formation of the central galaxy ( see sanders & fabian 2006 ) .",
    "this is the third in a series of papers analysing a deep ( 574 ks ) _ chandra _ observation of m87 , the dominant galaxy of the virgo cluster .",
    "the first two papers ( million 2010 , hereafter paper i ; werner 2010 , hereafter paper ii ) focus on the effect of the agn on the surrounding hot plasma .",
    "this paper focuses on the history of chemical enrichment of the central regions of the virgo cluster .",
    "many previous studies of this subject utilize _ xmm - newton _ or _ suzaku _ because of their better spectral resolution .",
    "however , the far superior spatial resolution of _ chandra _ , which allows us to better separate out obvious complications due to substructure ( as well as the sheer number of photons already collected with _ chandra _ ) allow us to probe the detailed distribution of metals with greatly improved accuracy over previous work .",

    "as discussed in paper i , beyond the innermost core and the x - ray bright arms , the gas can be well described by an isothermal model at each radius .",
    "we use partial annuli that vary in width from 10 to 30 arcsec , with @xmath0250,000 net counts in each of a total of 36 regions .",
    "background spectra were determined using the blank - sky fields available from the chandra x - ray center ( see paper i for details ) .",

    "a significant enhancement , or ` bump ' , in the fe and si ( and possibly s ) abundances is seen at @xmath2930  kpc .",
    "this is approximately the radius at which the bright x - ray arms terminate .",
    "as discussed in paper  i , this bump may be due to the uplift of cool , metal - rich material in the wake of buoyantly rising radio bubbles .",

    ".    the si / s abundance ratio profile ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fesis]f ) is an interesting cross check upon the determination of these abundances . because both elements are created in roughly equal quantities by both @xmath5 and @xmath3 ( see iwamoto et al .",

    "2006 ) , the si / s abundance ratio is insensitive to the relative fraction of supernovae that explode as @xmath5 and @xmath3 .",
    "any trend in the si / s abundance ratio profile is instead primarily affected by a change in the average yields of @xmath5 and @xmath3 as a function of radius . the si / s abundance ratio is consistent with being flat as a function of radius and its observed mean value is @xmath34 solar .",
    "the systematic uncertainties involved in the modelling of si and s lines are relatively small due to the favorable location of their lines in the 23  kev range , where no residual fe - l emission is present .",
    "possible biases due to multi - temperature structure are minimized by our choice of extraction regions which avoid clear density and temperature inhomogeneities and have an approximately isothermal azimuthal temperature structure ( see paper i ) .",
    "nonetheless , we performed detailed spectral simulations of multi - temperature plasmas to investigate possible biases due to residual structure and projection effects .",
    "we mixed apec thermal models with slightly different temperatures and metallicities , where the cooler plasma is more enriched than the hotter one .",
    "the simulated gas mixtures span a grid of possible projection effects and unresolved temperature structure .",
    "we fitted these simulated spectra with a single temperature model . the potential bias in si / fe , s / fe and si / s ratios was always less than 10  per cent .",
    "furthermore , we note that systematic uncertainties related to the effective area calibration of the acis detectors around the si edge would be likely to affect the si and s abundance profiles differently .",
    "therefore , the striking similarity of the si / fe and s / fe profiles strongly indicates that the detection of these trends is robust .      the top row of fig .",
    "[ fig : arca ] shows the ar ( left ) and ca ( right ) abundance profiles .",

    "our spectral fits reveal that the ar and ca abundances are relatively insensitive to small changes in the temperature and fe abundance",
    ". therefore , systematic uncertainties on these measurements are likely small .    the ar and ca abundance profiles ( fig .",

    "the elements observed in the x - ray emitting gas of clusters of galaxies reveal the integrated chemical enrichment history by supernovae .",
    "the standard picture of chemical enrichment in clusters of galaxies for at least the past 12 years has been an early enrichment by @xmath5 products that are now well mixed in the icm , in combination with a later contribution by @xmath3 , which have longer delay times and primarily enrich the region surrounding the cd galaxy .",

    "2003 ) this scenario can plausibly produce centrally peaked abundance profiles of sn@xmath2 products .",
    "another possible mechanism contributing to the observed centrally peaked distribution of sn@xmath2 products is strong early enrichment of the lowest entropy x - ray emitting gas and inefficient mixing of this material with the surrounding icm . if the lowest entropy x - ray emitting gas currently seen in the virgo cluster core was at high redshift located in the environments of massive galaxies during their epoch of maximum star formation , then this material may have become enriched significantly by sn@xmath2 products .",
    "as the cluster formed , this low entropy sn@xmath2 enriched gas will naturally sink and accumulate at the base of the cluster potential . assuming that it does not become well mixed with the surrounding icm as it does so and it does not cool out of the hot phase",
    ", this may lead to the observed peak in metal abundances .",
    "we explore other possible explanations for the observed abundance ratio profiles .",
    "each of these mechanisms predicts a central enhancement in the si / fe , s / fe , ar / fe , and ca / fe ratios and each of them might , to some degree , contribute to the observed radial trends .",
    "a stellar imf , which is flatter ( has a smaller @xmath96 in equation 2 , therefore producing more massive stars ) in the central regions of the cluster would produce a central increase of si - group elements .",
    "the ratios of chemical elements produced by @xmath5 are a strong function of the mass of the progenitor . to examine the effect of the imf on the predicted abundance ratios , we vary its slope @xmath96 .",
    "[ fig : alpha ] shows the predicted abundance ratios assuming a steepening imf as a function of radius and a radially constant relative fraction of @xmath3 , @xmath97 .",
    "this fraction was chosen to lie within the range suggested by the si / fe abundance ratio profile and it only affects the normalization of the predicted profiles .",
    "the explanation of the observed range of values in the radial profiles of the si / fe and s / fe ratios by a radial trend in the imf would require extremely steep imf at larger radii .",
    "moreover , this scenario would produce very large central increases of the ne / fe and mg / fe ratios , which we would clearly detect even given the systematic uncertainties in the ne and mg abundance determinations .    while we can not rule out a small radial trend in the stellar imf",
    ", it can not be responsible for the large observed ranges in the abundance ratios .",
    "we examine the effects of a possible radial trend in the @xmath5 pre - enrichment , i.e. the metallicity of the stars that produce the supernovae on the radial profiles of abundance ratios in the icm .",
    "[ fig : metals ] shows the predicted abundance ratios assuming that the metallicity of the @xmath5 progenitors is increasing as a function of radius .",
    "the yields of @xmath5 as a function of the initial metallicity are from nomoto ( 2006 ) and the absolute metallicity of @xmath98 is equal to solar .",
    "we assume a constant relative fraction of @xmath3 ( @xmath97 ) and the salpeter imf .",
    "the plot shows that @xmath5 with a lower initial metallicity produce higher si / fe and s / fe ratios .",
    "enrichment from infalling , low - entropy systems , which may be dominated by @xmath5 with relatively low metallicity progenitors during starbursts , could have contributed to the observed central peaks in the abundance ratios .",
    "we note that @xmath5 with a very low initial metallicity ( @xmath99 ) would produce large si / fe , s / fe , mg / fe , ca / fe , ar / fe , si / s , and ar / ca ratios and small ne / fe and ni / fe ratios that do not match our observations",
    ". therefore , bulk of the metals observed in the icm could not have been produced by extremely low metallicity stars .",
    "there is a growing evidence for a diversity in @xmath3 explosions ( see sullivan 2006 ; pritchet 2008 ; mannucci 2006 ) .",
    "while a population of brighter sn  ia with a slow luminosity decline is more common in late - type spiral and irregular galaxies with recent star formation ( indicating a short delay time between their formation and the explosion ) , a fainter and more rapidly decaying population of sn ia is more common in early - type galaxies ( hamuy 1996 ; ivanov 2000 ) .",
    "this diversity should be reflected in the abundance yields with the brighter sn  ia producing more ni and less si - group elements than the fainter ones .    based on early work with _ xmm - newton _ , finoguenov ( 2002 ) argue that the diversity in the sn  ia population would explain the distribution of chemical elements in the virgo cluster .",
    "the variation of the peak brightness , which correlates with the production of @xmath100ni and anti - correlates with the production of si - group elements , can also be explained in the framework of the delayed detonation models by a variation of the deflagration - to - detonation transition density ( transition from subsonic to supersonic flame velocities ) .",
    "[ fig : div ] presents the expected yields for a variety of @xmath3 explosion models from iwamoto ( 1999 ) , with the wdd1 , wdd2 , wdd3 and w7 models on the x - axis .",
    "we assume a constant relative fraction of @xmath3 , @xmath97 .",
    "the w7 model represents a pure deflagration explosion mechanism .",
    "the wdd models represent delayed - detonation explosions and the last digit indicates the density at which the flame velocity becomes supersonic ( deflagration - to - detonation transition density ) in units of @xmath101  g  @xmath75 .",
    "this transition density is likely dependent on the composition of the progenitor ( see jackson 2010 ) .",
    "matching our observed si / fe and s / fe profiles , given the existing @xmath3 yields , would require that the centre of the galaxy has been enriched almost solely by wdd1 supernovae while the outer regions almost solely by wdd3 .",
    "the contribution by sn  ia with longer delay times and larger si / fe ratio would be the largest in the centre of the galaxy , but any realistic enrichment scenario predicts an enrichment by a mixture of different types of sn  ia at all radii .",
    "this model predicts a large central increase in the ar / fe and ca / fe abundance ratios that seem to be in conflict with the observed relatively flat profiles .",
    "the predicted mg / fe profile is relatively flat in agreement with observations .",
    "the strongest prediction of this model is the @xmath102 per cent rise in the ni / fe abundance ratio with the increasing radius .",
    "our observed ni / fe profile , which is unfortunately dominated by systematic uncertainties , suggests a relatively flat radial distribution .",
    "the o / fe ratio of @xmath103 solar determined in the centre of m  87 with the _ xmm - newton _ reflection grating spectrometers ( werner et al .",
    "2006b ; these data resolve the o line and the individual lines of the fe - l complex ) is significantly lower than the values predicted by the proposed enrichment scenarios .",
    "these best fit o / fe ratios are consistent with the values determined using the ccd type detectors on _ xmm - newton _ ( matsushita et al .",
    "either the measurements strongly underestimate the o abundance or some key aspect of the chemical enrichment of the hot icm / ism is not understood . using the recently updated atomdb atomic database , the best fitting o / fe ratios are 50 per cent larger compared to the previous version , indicating that at least part of the discrepancy might be a modeling issue .",
    "furthermore , all of our proposed enrichment scenarios are incompatible with the rising o / fe abundance profile reported from _ xmm - newton _ ( bhringer et al",
    ". 2001 , finoguenov et al .",
    "2002 , matsushita et al .",
    "however , measurements of the o line emission at @xmath104  kev with ccd detectors suffer from significant systematic uncertainties due to a combination of limited spectral resolution , residual gain uncertainties , coupled with incomplete modelling of the detector oxygen edge and possible incomplete subtraction of the o line emission from the galactic foreground ( which could bias the o abundance measurement in the outskirts of m  87 high ) .",
    "these systematic uncertainties force us to treat all current o abundance measurements with caution .",
    "more robust measurements of the o / fe profile will be possible with the calorimeters on the _ astro - h _ satellite .",
    "using a deep ( 574  ks ) _ chandra _ observation of m87 , we performed the best measurements to date of the radial distributions of metals in the ambient central icm of the virgo cluster .",
    "we conclude that :    * the abundance profiles of fe , si , s , ar , ca , ne , mg , and ni are all centrally peaked .",
    "* the abundance profiles of si and s are more centrally peaked than fe , challenging the standard picture of chemical enrichment in galaxy clusters , wherein sn  ia products are thought to dominate the central enrichment . rather , despite a negligible current star formation rate in m87 and the continuing enrichment by sn  ia , the integrated relative contribution of core collapse supernovae to the enrichment is higher in the central low entropy core than in the surrounding icm .",
    "the observed abundance patterns are most likely due to one or more of the following processes : continuing enrichment by winds of a stellar population which has been pre - enriched mainly by sn@xmath2 products ; intermittent formation of massive stars in the central cooling core on time scales shorter than the continuing enrichment by sn  ia ; or strong early sn@xmath2 enrichment of the lowest entropy x - ray emitting gas that is subsequently not well mixed and does not cool out of the hot icm phase .",
    "* other processes , such as stellar initial mass function that changes with radius , changes in the pre - enrichment of core - collapse supernova progenitors , and diversity in the elemental yields of sn  ia , might have also contributed to the observed radial profiles . *",
    "although systematic uncertainties prevent us from measuring the o abundance robustly , indications are that it is about 2 times lower than predicted by the enrichment models .",
