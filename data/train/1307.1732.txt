    "simulations of lattice qcd ( lqcd ) are in practice the only reliable approach to qcd thermodynamics which covers the broad region of strongly interacting matter properties from the hadron gas at low temperatures to a deconfined quark gluon plasma phase at high temperatures .",
    "recently , finite temperature lqcd simulations have overcome the difficulties of reaching the low physical light quark masses and approaching the continuum limit which makes this theoretical laboratory now a benchmark for modeling qcd under extreme conditions .",
    "we are going to present a combined effective model reproducing the equation of state of hadronic matter as obtained in recent lattice qcd simulations @xcite .",
    "the model should reproduce basic physical characteristics of processes encountered in dense hadronic matter , from the hot qcd phase through the critical temperature region till the lower temperature hadron resonance gas phase . in medium properties of hadrons are different from those in the vacuum .",
    "the very notion of the mass shell should be modified , as was postulated quite long ago @xcite .",
    "the interaction becomes effectively nonlocal due to the mott effect and hadrons eventually gradually dissolve into quarks and gluons in the high temperature phase .",
    "then , with the increasing temperature , quark masses are less and less important although the massless stefan - boltzmann limit would be eventually reached only at extremely high temperature",
    ".    it has been shown that the equation of state derived from that time qcd lattice calculation @xcite can be reproduced by a simple hadron gas resonance model . the rapid rise of the number of degrees of freedom in lattice qcd data around the critical temperature @xmath0 mev , can be explained quantitatively by a resonance gas below the critical temperature @xmath1 @xcite .    for higher temperatures the model",
    "is modified by introducing finite widths of heavy hadrons @xcite with a heuristic ansatz for the spectral function which reflects medium modifications of hadrons .",
    "this fits nicely the lattice data , also above @xmath1 as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] .",
    "this mott - hagedorn type model @xcite has been constructed to fit nicely the lattice data , also above @xmath1 where it does so because it leaves light hadrons below a mass threshold of @xmath2 gev unaffected .",
    "the description of the lattice data at high temperatures is accidental because the effective number of those degrees of freedom approximately coincides with that of quarks and gluons .",
    "the qgp presence in this region is formally simulated here by the smart choice of the mass cut - off parameter such that cut - off defined stable light hadrons provide the same number of degrees of freedom as partonic components of the qgp .",
    "the considered model is here gradually refined to take into account those physical processes present in the full qcd treatment .",
    "the uniform treatment of all hadronic resonances , without artificial stability island , is reached by a state - dependent hadron resonance width @xmath3 given by the inverse collision time scale in a resonance gas @xcite .    in order to remove this unphysical aspect of the otherwise appealing model one has to extend the spectral broadening also to the light hadrons and",
    "thus describe their disappearance due to the mott effect while simultaneously the quark and gluon degrees of freedom appear at high temperatures due to chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement .    in the present contribution we will report results obtained by introducing a unified treatment of all hadronic resonances with a state - dependent width @xmath3 in accordance with the inverse hadronic collision time scale from a recent model for chemical freeze - out in a resonance gas @xcite .",
    "the appearance of quark and gluon degrees of freedom is introduced by the polyakov - loop improved nambu ",

    "the model is further refined by adding perturbative corrections to @xmath4 for the high - momentum region above the three - momentum cutoff inherent in the pnjl model .",

    "[ fig.1 ] we show the results for the thermodynamic quantities ( pressure , energy density and squared speed of sound ) of the mhrg model at this stage .",
    "the nice correspondence with results from lattice qcd is not accidental for the temperature region @xmath44 mev , where has been shown in @xcite that a hadron resonance gas perfectly describes the lattice qcd data . for @xmath45",
    "the broadening of the spectral function ( [ one ] ) which affects at this stage of the model only the hadronic resonances with @xmath46 leads to the vanishing of their contribution at about @xmath47 while the light hadrons with masses @xmath48 are not affected and gradually reach the stefan- boltzmann ( sb ) limit determined by their number of degrees of freedom . as has been noted in @xcite , this number ( @xmath49 ) accidentally ( or by duality arguments )",
    "coincides with that of the quarks and gluons ( @xmath50 ) for @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , imposing that all mesons lighter than @xmath2 gev are stable provides us with a sb limit at high temperatures which fakes that of quarks and gluons in the case for three flavors .",
    "although providing us with an excellent fit of the lattice data , the high - temperature phase of this model is unphysical since it ignores the mott effect for light hadrons . due to the chiral phase transition at @xmath1 , the quarks loose their mass and therefore the threshold of the continuum of quark - antiquark scattering states is lowered . at the same time",
    "the light meson masses , however , remain almost unaffected by the increase in the temperature of the system .",
    "consequently , they merge the continuum and become unbound - their spectral function changes from a delta - function ( on - shell bound states ) to a breit - wigner - type ( off - shell , resonant scattering states ) .",

    "later , within the njl model , a microscopic approach to the thermodynamics of the mott dissociation of mesons in quark matter has been given in the form of a generalized beth - uhlenbeck equation of state @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "as a microscopic treatment of the mott effect for all resonances is presently out of reach , we introduce an ansatz for a state - dependent hadron resonance width @xmath3 given by the inverse collision time scale recently suggested within an approach to the chemical freeze - out and chiral condensate in a resonance gas @xcite @xmath55 which is based on a binary collision approximation and relaxation time ansatz using for the in - medium hadron - hadron cross sections the geometrical povh - hfner law @xcite . in eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) the coefficient @xmath56 is a free parameter , @xmath57 is the partial density of the hadron @xmath58 and the mean squared radii of hadrons @xmath59 obtain in the medium a temperature dependence which is governed by the ( partial ) restoration of chiral symmetry . for the pion this was quantitatively studied within the njl model @xcite and it was shown that close to the mott transition the pion radius is well approximated by @xmath60 and a pion cloud contribution @xmath61 where from the vacuum values @xmath62 fm and @xmath63 fm one gets @xmath64 fm .",
    "a key point of our approach is that the temperature dependent hadronic radii shall diverge when hadron dissociation ( mott effect ) sets in , driven basically by the restoration of chiral symmetry . as a consequence , in the vicinity of the chiral restoration temperature",
