    "it is believed that particle settling and growth are important processes leading to the planet formation in protoplanetary disks .",
    "observationally some evidences of dust size growth have been proposed based on dust continuum emission from the protoplanetary disks , such as smaller power - law indices of spectral energy distributions ( seds ) in sub - mm to cm wavelength bands , and fainter trapezium feature of 10@xmath3 silicate emission , compared with those of the interstellar dust grains ( e.g. , beckwith & sargent 1991 ; miyake & nakagawa 1993 ; beckwith et al .",

    "meanwhile , theoretically the initial stage of dust evolution when micron - sized interstellar dust particles grow into centimeter - sized particles with settling toward the disk midplane have been studied analytically and numerically ; for example , weidenschilling ( 1980 ) and nakagawa et al .",

    "( 1993 ) and weidenschilling ( 1997 , 2004 ) s works in local turbulence induced by the shear between the dust layer and the gas near the disk midplane ( see also weidenschilling & cuzzi 1993 and references therein ) .",
    "in addition to the shear - induced turbulence , it is thought that there exists global turbulent motion in the protoplanetary disks , which is caused by thermal convective and/or magneto - rotational instabilities ( e.g. , lin & papaloizou 1980 ; balbus & hawley 1991 ) .",
    "the turbulent motion of the gas is known to affect the dust evolution processes ; turbulence induced relative motion increases the mutual collision rate , that is , the growth rate of the dust particles ( e.g. , vlk et al . 1980 ) , turbulent mixing motion lets the particles move diffusively ( e.g. , cuzzi et al . 1993 ) , and turbulent eddies trap the dust particles ( e.g. , klahr & henning 1997 ; cuzzi et al .",
    "2001 ; johansen et al .",
    "on the other hand , the disk instabilities , namely , the existence of turbulent regions depend on the spatial and size distributions of the dust particles ( e.g. , mizuno et al .",
    "1988 ; sano et al .",
    "2000 ; nomura 2004 ) .",
    "therefore , self - consistent treatment of the evolution of the dust particles and the turbulent regions ( the disk instabilities ) is needed in order to understand the very beginning of planet formation process in protoplanetary disks before the dust particles settle toward the disk midplane and form a dusty layer , which could lead to the planetesimal formation .",
    "moreover , recent observations have been providing a huge amount of data of spectra and seds of dust continuum emission as well as molecular line emissions from protoplanetary disks . theoretically reproducing these observational data",
    "have been also developed using detailed disk models ( e.g. , kenyon & hartmann 1987 ; miyake & nakagawa 1995 ; chiang & goldreich 1997 ; dalessio et al .",

    "thus , we should carefully model the dust evolution in the disks and compare the model predictions with the observational data in order to interpret the observations and understand what is actually going on in protoplanetary disks . the seds of young stellar objects have been tried to be modeled by numerically simulating the dust size growth and settling processes in the disks ( suttner & yorke 2001 ; tanaka et al .",

    "we also discuss the dust evolution in a globally turbulent disk in  4 .",
    "finally , the results are summarized in  5 .",
    "as a disk model , we adopt the minimum mass solar nebular model ( e.g. , safronov 1969 ; hayashi 1981 ; hayashi et al . 1985 ) in order to examine basic behavior of the dust evolution under a simple physical condition of the gas and compare the results with analytic calculation ( see  [ sect3 ] ) . in this model",

    "the shape of the dust particles is simply assumed to be a compact sphere in this paper . we note that the dust shape ( mass / area ratio ) affects the dust evolution through the drag coefficient and the sticking rate ( see next subsection ) , and many numerical studies have dealt with the effects of the dust shape , taking into account fractal structure of dust aggregates ( e.g. , weidenschilling & cuzzi 1993 ; ossenkopf 1993 ; weidenschilling 1997 ; suttner & yorke 2001 ; dullemond & dominik 2005 ) .",
    "now , we assume that the disk is axisymmetric and rotates around the central star at nearly keplerian velocity , and set the dust and gas velocities relative to the keplerian velocity , @xmath36 , as @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "as far as the dust particles are small enough , the timescale for initial velocity of dust particles decaying due to the gas drag force is much shorter than the keplerian time and the timescale of collision between dust particles ( e.g. , nakagawa et al . 1981 ) .",

    "by numerically solving the coagulation equation for settling dust particles ( eq . [ [ eq12 ] ] ) , we obtain the dust size distributions at a given time and disk height at the earth s ( 1au ) , jupiter s ( 5.2au ) , or neptune s ( 30au ) orbits . as an initial condition",

    "figure [ f2 ] shows the time evolution of spatial dust mass distribution obtained by our numerical calculation at the orbits of @xmath83 ( a ) 1au , ( b ) 5.2au , and ( c ) 30au .",

    "these characteristic heights are defined in nsh86 ( see fig.1 of nsh86 ) ; to put it briefly , the vertical velocity , @xmath91 ( eq .

[ [ eq10 ] ] ) , above @xmath93 , and the gas density , @xmath94 , is larger than the dust density , @xmath27 , above @xmath95 .",
    "the vertical velocity , @xmath91 , dominates the radial velocity , @xmath92 , again below @xmath96 where the dust density is high enough that the gas drag force hardly affects the radial motion of the dust particles .",
    "if most dust particles settle below @xmath97 , the dust layer becomes gravitationally unstable and could fragment into planetesimals .",
    "the dashed , dotted , dot - dashed , and solid lines in figure [ f2 ] represent the dust surface density below @xmath98 , and @xmath90 , respectively . as time goes on , the dust particles settle toward the disk midplane and more mass is included in the lower layer of the disk . in figure [ f3 ]",
    "we plot the dust settling time at which 70% of the total dust mass settles below @xmath99 ( @xmath86 ) at the orbits of @xmath82au ( squares ) , 5.2au ( circles ) , and 30au ( diamonds ) .",
    "together with them , the dust settling time obtained by nsh86 is also plotted ( triangles with solid lines ) .",
    "the figure shows that the numerical results are in good agreement with the analytic results , and most dust particles settle below @xmath97 , which leads to the formation of a gravitationally unstable dust layer , within about @xmath0 , @xmath100 , and @xmath1 yrs at the orbits of @xmath831 , 5.2 , and 30 au , respectively , in a quiescent disk .",

    "now , we can see from figure [ f1 ] that the larger dust particles which have grown at the disk surface layer settle more rapidly toward the midplane with growing larger and larger .",
    "these processes lead to a bimodal size distribution near the midplane at the inner disk ( e.g. , weidenschilling 1997 ) .",

    "the drag coefficient always follows epstein s law at @xmath104 and 30au in this model , where @xmath32 is much larger ( @xmath114 and @xmath115 cm , respectively ) .",
    "the timescale of the dust size growth and settling is shorter at the inner disk where the effect of gravitational force of the central star is stronger .",

    "we plot the resulting largest dust radii at @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) and @xmath82au ( squares ) , 5.2au ( circles ) , and 30au ( diamonds ) .",
    "the largest dust radii , @xmath116 , at @xmath85 are obtained applying a criterion , @xmath117 , to the dust size distribution at @xmath118 ( cf .",
    "thin solid lines in fig .",

    "is also plotted ( triangles with solid lines ) .",
    "the figure shows that the numerical results are in good agreement with the analytic results within a factor of two , except at @xmath93 .",
    "the dust radii at @xmath93 are larger in the numerical calculation because the relative velocity between dust particles due to the thermal brownian motion , which works efficiently for small dust particles , is taken into account in the numerical calculation , but not in the analytic calculation in nsh86 .",
    "both numerical and analytic calculations show that the dust particles grow and their radii finally reach about 20 , 7 , and 1 cm at the orbits of @xmath831 , 5.2 , and 30 au , respectively , just before they settle below @xmath97 .",
    "we note that the orbital decay is very little in a quiescent disk ; during settling from @xmath119 to @xmath97 , the dust particles move radially by @xmath120 , 0.20 , and 2.8au at the orbits of @xmath82 , 5.2 , and 30au , respectively , according to nsh86 .    here",
    "it should be commented that although we simply assume a totally quiescent disk in this section , in reality it is expected that the shear between the dust layer and the gas induces turbulence locally near the midplane as the dust particles settle ( e.g. , cuzzi et al .",
    "1993 ; weidenschilling & cuzzi 1993 ; weidenschilling 1997 ; cuzzi & weidenschilling 2005 ) .",
    "actually if we compute the richardson number , @xmath121 ( e.g. , sekiya 1998 ; chandrasekhar 1961 ) , we can find that @xmath122 and the shear instability will occur below @xmath95 at each orbit . in such a turbulent layer the dust particles do not concentrate in the midplane and migrate inward very rapidly once they grow large enough as we will see in next section ( although it is different in point that this is local turbulence ) .    in conclusion , our numerical calculation have confirmed that nsh86 s approximate treatment of the dust size growth and settling processes are appropriate for describing the dust settling time and the evolution of the largest dust size in an ideally quiescent disk , although they did not take into account the dust size distribution explicitly .",
    "this will be because most dust mass is included in the dust particles with the largest sizes , and the dust settling time is controlled by the largest dust particles which have the highest settling velocity .",
    "in this section we discuss the dust evolution in the disk in which global turbulent motion exists induced by , for example , thermal convective and/or magneto - rotational instabilities .",
    "first , we examine the vertical motion of one dust particle , not the mean motion which we have treated in the previous sections . the equation of motion of a dust particle ( eq.[[eq6 ] ] ) in the vertical direction is written as @xmath123 the vertical velocity of the gas in a turbulent medium is generally given by @xmath124 , where the overline means a time average and the prime is a fluctuation due to the turbulent motion .",
    "now we put the mean velocity to be @xmath125 since we assume the hydrostatic equilibrium . as the component of turbulent fluctuation",
    ", we simply adopt an oscillating motion of @xmath126 , which models the motion of the largest turbulent eddy with a velocity @xmath127 and a frequency @xmath128 ( @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the eddy size ) . in this case , equation ( [ eq17 ] ) has a general solution that consists of a mean motion part , @xmath131 , and a fluctuation part , @xmath132 , caused by the turbulent motion of the gas , @xmath133 where @xmath134 and @xmath135}}{\\displaystyle{[(\\omega_{\\rm k}^2-\\omega_{\\rm t}^2)^2+d_g^2\\omega_{\\rm t}^2]^{1/2}}}},\\ \\ \\",

    "if we think a more realistic case , the turbulent velocity of the gas , @xmath143 , will be modeled by a superposition of eddies with various sizes , velocities , and frequencies , which is often decomposed into fourier components ( e.g. , landau & lifshitz 1959 ) . in this case the term for fluctuating motion ( [ eq19.2 ] ) is also given by a superposition of oscillations with various frequencies .",
    "now , the mean motion part ( [ eq19.1 ] ) shows the settling of the dust particle toward the disk midplane . from equation ( [ eq19.0 ] ) we can derive the particle velocity , which also consists of a mean motion , @xmath144 , and a fluctuation , @xmath145 , as @xmath146 where @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",

    "we note that in a quiescent disk in which @xmath153 , a general solution of equation ( [ eq17 ] ) is simply given by the mean motion part , @xmath131 , in equation ( [ eq19.1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the dust particles always settle toward the disk midplane ; the motion of a large dust particle which satisfies @xmath154 is oscillation around @xmath84 , damped ( that is , the particle settles toward the disk midplane ) with a timescale of @xmath155 , while a smaller particle ( @xmath149 ) settles with a timescale of @xmath156 without oscillation ( e.g. , nsh86 ) .",
    "next , we will discuss the radial motion of the dust particles in a turbulent disk .",
    "when the dust particles are small enough , their motion is strongly coupled with the turbulent gas motion .",
    "if the particles grow and reach a critical radius , they are released from the turbulent eddy trapping and migrate toward the central star ( see e.g. , klahr & henning 1997 for more detailed description of the dust particle motion in a turbulent eddy ) . the critical radius , @xmath157 , is roughly estimated by comparing the friction time between the gas and dust particles , @xmath158 , with the turnover time of the largest turbulent eddy , @xmath159 , and given by @xmath160 the critical radii at @xmath831 , 5.2 , and 30au are @xmath161 , 80 , and 6 cm , respectively .",

    "the figure shows that more than 70% of the total dust mass moves toward the central star very rapidly within about 70 , @xmath192 , and @xmath193 yrs in a strongly turbulent disk ( @xmath181 ; solid lines ) , while about @xmath194 , @xmath195 , and @xmath196 yrs in a weakly turbulent disk ( @xmath178 ; dashed lines ) , at the orbits of @xmath831 , 5.2 , and 30 au , respectively .",
    "the timescale of the dust size growth is shorter at the inner disk where the particle density is higher .",
    "figure [ f5 ] shows the resulting size distributions of mass density of dust particles , @xmath101 , normalized by @xmath197 at ( a ) @xmath82au , @xmath198 yr , ( b ) @xmath104au , @xmath199 yr , and ( c ) @xmath107au , @xmath108 yr , in a strongly turbulent disk ( @xmath181 ) .",
    "figure [ f5.5 ] is the same as figure [ f5 ] , but in a weakly turbulent disk ( @xmath178 ) , at ( a ) @xmath82au , @xmath200 yr , ( b ) @xmath104au , @xmath105 yr , and ( c ) @xmath107au , @xmath201 yr .",
    "we note that the normalization factor in fiugres [ f5 ] and [ f5.5 ] is different from that in figure [ f1 ] ; @xmath197 used in fiugres [ f5 ] and [ f5.5 ] is the initial dust density , @xmath202 and @xmath203 for @xmath10au and @xmath11au , respectively , while @xmath27 used in figure [ f1 ] is the dust density at a specific time and spatial position defined in equation ( [ eq14 ] ) .",
    "the thick solid , dashed , and dot - dashed lines in each figure represent the size distributions at @xmath119 , @xmath204 , and @xmath205 , respectively .",
    "the time used in the figures is when 70% of the dust particles grow large enough to migrate toward the central star very rapidly at each orbit , @xmath5 ( see fig .",
    "we can see from the figures that at each orbit , @xmath5 , the size distributions of smaller dust particles are almost identical at each height , while those of larger particles are very different . in the strongly turbulent disk ( @xmath181 ; fig .",
    "[ f5 ] ) the smaller particles have similar size distributions at each height mainly because the turbulence induced motion dominates the relative velocity and the dust size growth ( e.g. , weidenschilling 1984 ) in almost all disk heights , @xmath13 ; i.e. , @xmath206 independent of @xmath13 .",
    "meanwhile , in the weakly turbulent disk ( @xmath181 ; fig .",
    "[ f5.5 ] ) the differential vertical velocity , @xmath207 , dominates the relative velocity at @xmath208 where the gravitational force in the vertical direction is strong , while the turbulence induced relative velocity , @xmath75 , is dominant near the disk midplane .",
    "therefore , the dust particles grow more rapidly at the disk surface , @xmath208 , and small particles are replenished from lower disk layers via the turbulent mixing , which works so as to uniform @xmath101 .",
    "consequently , the size distributions of smaller particles are not very different at each height also in the weakly turbulent disk .",
    "while the diffusive motion of turbulent mixing is strong enough to prevent the settling for the smaller particles , the larger particles can not be sustained because of weak coupling with the gas and settle toward the disk midplane .",
    "so , the larger particles near the disk surface deplete as we can see from the figures .",
    "the depletion is more remarkable in the weakly turbulent disk ( e.g. , dubrulle et al .",
    "1995 ; cuzzi et al .",
    "1996 ; cuzzi & weidenschilling 2005 ) .",
    "the gaps appear around @xmath209(7 , 4 , and 1.1)@xmath210 at @xmath82 , 5.2 , and 30au , respectively , in figures [ f5 ] and [ f5.5 ] , owing to the discontinuities of the approximate treatment of the turbulence induced relative motion at @xmath211 ( see eq . [ [ eq22 ] ] ) .",
    "our result that the most dust particles migrate toward the central star at a very short timescale suggests that global turbulent motion should cease for the planetesimal formation in protoplanetary disks .",
    "unless the strength of turbulence is weak , the density of dust particles around the disk midplane will be low enough because of the turbulent stirring so that they can not collisionally grow into planetesimals , as has been noted also by some previous works ( e.g. , stepinski & valageas 1996 ; cuzzi & zahnle 2004 ; weidenschilling 2004 ; cuzzi & weidenschilling 2005 ) . in a quiescent disk",
    "the dust particles will settle toward the disk midplane and form a dust layer in a sufficiently short timescale as we have seen in the previous section . afterwards",
    "the shear between the dust layer and the gas will cause a local turbulent motion near the midplane .",
    "detailed analysis of the evolution of dust particles in such a turbulent dust layer , although it is beyond a scope of this work , is in progress for further understanding of the planetesimal formation process ( e.g. , goldreich & ward 1973 ; cuzzi et al .",
    "1993 ; weidenschilling 1995 ; sekiya 1998 ; ishitsu & sekiya 2003 ; youdin & shu 2002 ; weidenschilling 2003 ; youdin & chiang 2004 ) .",
    "we have investigated the dust size growth and settling toward the disk midplane in a quiescent or turbulent protoplanetary disk by numerically solving coagulation equation for settling dust particles .",
    "our result shows that the dust particles settle toward the disk midplane to form a gravitationally unstable layer at a short timescale ( @xmath0@xmath1yr at @xmath83130 au ) if we assume an ideally quiescent disk .",
    "the radii of the largest dust particles just before the formation of the unstable layer are 201 cm at 130 au . the resulting settling time and evolution of the largest dust radius in our numerical simulation are in good agreement with those obtained by the analytic calculation in nsh86 , although they did not take into account the dust size distribution explicitly .",
    "this is because most dust mass is included in the dust particles with the largest sizes , and these particles control the dust settling time .",
    "also , we have discussed the dust evolution in an opposite extreme case of a globally turbulent disk to find that the dust particles are forced to fluctuate by turbulent motion of the gas , and grow to be large enough ( 326 cm at 130au ) to move inward very rapidly within a short timescale ( @xmath212@xmath2yr at 130 au ) .",
    "thus , our result suggests that the disk should be quiescent or the global turbulent motion should cease before most mass of dust particles accrete onto the central star , in order to form planetesimals in protoplanetary disks .",
    "self - consistent treatment of the evolution of the globally turbulent regions and the dust evolution processes is needed in future work .",
    "in addition , the dust evolution in a locally turbulent motion induced by the shear between the dust layer and the gas near the disk midplane should be investigated for further understanding of the planetesimal formation process .",
    "we would like to thank the referee , dr .",
