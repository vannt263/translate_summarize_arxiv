    "glueballs , predicted by qcd , are so exotic from the point of view of the naive quark model that their existence will be a confirmation of qcd .",
    "extensive numerical studies have been carried out to simulate the glueball spectrum and resulted that the low - lying glueballs are in the mass range 1  3 gev , which suggests that the @xmath1 radiative decays are the ideal hunting ground for glueballs .",
    "there are several possible glueball candidates in the final states of @xmath1 radiative decays , however , more criteria are needed for their unambiguous identifications , one of which might be the partial widths of @xmath1 radiative decays into glueballs . to estimate these partial widths , the vacuum - to - glueball transition matrix elements(tme ) of local gluonic operators",
    "should be derived first .",
    "the techniques of lattice simulations in the glueball sector have been substantially improved in the past decade .",
    "inspired by the success of anisotropic lattice techniques in the simulations of the glueball spectrum  @xcite and as a continuation of former studies  @xcite , this work is devoted to the numerical study of tme on anisotropic lattices with tadpole - improved gauge action .",
    "the tme computed in this work are @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , where @xmath5 refers to the glueball state with the quantum number @xmath6 , and the local operators @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are trace anomaly @xmath10 , the energy - momentum tensor @xmath11 , and the topological charge density @xmath12 , respectively ( @xmath13 is the gauge field strength and @xmath14 the gauge coupling ) .",
    "two types of lattice local gluonic operators ( type - i and type - ii ) are constructed in this work .",
    "type - i operators are linear combinations of a set of small wilson loops according to the irreducible representations of the lattice symmetry group , namely , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18  @xcite . letting @xmath19",
    "be the local operators of specific quantum number @xmath20 , the construction of type - i operators can be expressed as @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the combinational coefficients .",
    "different wilson loops @xmath23 are included with proper factors @xmath24 to improve the operator .    to construct type - ii operators",
    ", we define the lattice gauge field strength @xmath25 as @xmath26 where @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are respectively the plaquette and rectangle at @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath30 means the clover average , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are factors including the tadpole parameter @xmath33 and are chosen in a way that yields @xmath34 ( @xmath35 is the spatial lattice spacing ) .",

    "( , b ) ( or ( , e ) ) means the operator is made up of color - magnetic ( or color - electric ) field , and ( ps ) refers to the pseudoscalar channel .",
    "numerical simulations were carried out on anisotropic lattices with tadpole - improved gauge action  @xcite .",
    "five independent simulations have been done with input parameter listed in table . 1 .    with the tadpole improvement , the local gluonic operators on the lattice are all improved to @xmath37 ( @xmath35 is the spatial lattice spacing ) at the tree level . with applying the variational method to the combinations of smeared wilson loops with different prototypes  @xcite ,",
    "glueball states are obtained through correlators of smeared operators which have large overlaps with glueball states .",
    "six independent runs were carried out , on lattices with spatial lattice spacings in the range 0.1 @xmath0 ",
    "0.22 @xmath0 , to measure the smeared - smeared correlators @xmath38 and smeared - local correlators @xmath39 .",
    "the matrix elements are extracted by fitting @xmath38 and @xmath39 simultaneously using the correlated @xmath40 method .",
    "the fit models are taken as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the amplitude of the glueball operators , @xmath43 is the glueball - to - vacuum matrix element , and @xmath44 is the glueball mass .",
    "the finite volume effects ( fve ) of matrix elements are studied on lattices @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 at @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where each point with a errorbar is the fractional change , @xmath50 , in the matrix elements ( @xmath51 is the average value of the matrix elements of glueball @xmath52 over the three lattice volumes , and @xmath53 is the matrix element of glueball @xmath52 measured on lattice @xmath54 ) .",
