    "the physics of transition metal perovskites with general chemical formula abo@xmath1 ( where a is a large cation , similar in size to o@xmath6 and b is a small transition metal ( tm ) cation ) has attracted and challenged the interest and curiosity of the material science community for many decades , due to huge variety of complex phenomena arising from the subtle coupling between structural , electronic and magnetic degrees of freedom .",
    "the high degree of chemical flexibility and the localized ( i.e. not spatially homogeneous ) character of the dominant tm partially filled @xmath5 states lead to the coexistence of several physical interactions  spin , charge , lattice and orbital  which are all simultaneously active .",
    "the occurrence of strong lattice - electron , electron - spin and spin - orbit couplings causes several fascinating phenomena , including metal - insulator transitions@xcite , superconductivity@xcite , colossal magnetoresistance@xcite , multiferroicity@xcite , bandgaps spanning the visible and ultraviolet@xcite , and surface chemical reactivity from active to inert@xcite .",
    "when the additional degrees of freedom afforded by the combinatorial assemblage of perovskite building blocks in superlattices , heterointerfaces and thin films are introduced the range of properties increases all the more , as demonstrated by the recent several remarkable discoveries in the field of oxide heterostructures@xcite .",
    "tunability and control of these intermingled effects can be further achieved by means of external stimuli such as doping@xcite , pressure@xcite , temperature and magnetic or electric fields@xcite , thereby enhancing the tailoring capability of perovskites for a wide range of functionalities .",
    "this rich array of behaviors uniquely suit perovskites for novel solutions in different sectors of modern technology ( optoelectronics , spintronics , piezoelectric devices and ( photo)catalysis ) , for which conventional semiconductors can not be used@xcite .",
    "theoretical studies of tm perovskites , aiming to describe and understand the underlying physical mechanisms determining their complex electronic structures have been mainly developed within two historically distinct solid state communities , model hamiltonians@xcite and _ first principles_@xcite , which in the recent years have initiated to fruitfully cross - connect each other methodologies towards more general schemes such as dft+dmft ( density functional theory@xcite + dynamical mean field theory@xcite ) , with the aim to overtake the individual limitations and to improve the applicability and predictive power of electronic structure theory@xcite .",
    "model hamiltonians approaches adopt simplified lattice fermion models , typically the celebrated _ hubbard model _ , inspired by the seminal works of anderson@xcite , hubbard@xcite and kanamori@xcite in which the many - body problem is solved using a small number of _ relevant _ bands and short - ranged electron interactions .",
    "these effective models can solve the many - body problem very accurately , also including ordering and quantum fluctuations , but critically depends on an large number of adjustable parameters ( which can be in principle derivable by _ first principles _",
    "schemes@xcite ) , and its applicability is restricted to finite - size systems@xcite . in dft the intractable many - body problem of interacting electrons is mapped into a simplified problem of non - interacting electrons moving in an effective potential throughout the kohn - sahm scheme@xcite , and electron exchange - correlation ( xc ) effects are accounted by the xc potential which is approximated using xc functionals such as the local density approximation ( lda ) , the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) _ et similaria_@xcite .",
    "as the name suggests , in dft the ground state properties are obtained only from the charge density , and this makes dft fundamentally different from wavefunction - based approaches as the hartee - fock method , the simplest approximation to the many - body problem which includes the exact exchange but no correlation@xcite . though dft has been widely and successfully used in the last 40 years in solid - state physics and quantum - chemistry to calculate structural data , energetics and , to a lesser extent , electronic and magnetic properties , it suffers of fundamental difficulties mostly due to the approximate treatment of xc effects .",
    "this drawback is particularly severe when dft is applied to the so called strongly correlated systems ( scss ) , whose prototypical examples are transition metal oxides ( tmos ) .",
    "a systematic improvement of these xc - related deficiencies in dft is essentially impossible , but several beyond - dft approaches have been proposed which deliver much more satisfying results .",
    "the most renewed ones are the dft+u@xcite , sic@xcite , hybrid functionals@xcite , and gw@xcite .",
    "for a recent review on dft and beyond applied to transition metal oxides see .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab:19 ]",
    "it is instructive at this point to compare the set of parameters @xmath7 with the optimum values of @xmath2 obtained throughout the inverse dielectric constant relation @xmath8 introduced in the computational section ( eq . [ eq : alpha ] ) and derived by mapping hybrid dft with gw .",
    "the measured dielectric constant @xmath9@xcite and the corresponding @xmath10 values are also listed in table [ tab:19 ] , along with the pead hse values of @xmath9 obtained for @xmath2=@xmath7 .",
    "remarkably , the agreement between the measured and calculated @xmath9 is very good . the nice correlation between @xmath7 and @xmath11",
    "can be appreciated graphically in fig .",
    "[ fig : gapeps ] .",
    "theses two curves follow a very similar behavior characterized by an initial large value of @xmath2 for the poorly screened d@xmath12 band insulator lasco@xmath1 followed by a plateau of similar values in the range d@xmath13 ( latio@xmath1 ) @xmath14 d@xmath15 ( lafeo@xmath1 ) and finally a sharp decrease towards the more strongly screened metallic compounds characterized by a completely filled @xmath3 manifold . for lanio@xmath1 and lacuo@xmath1",
    "the optimum value of @xmath2 is zero ( not shown ) .",
    "thus , the @xmath16 curve derived from the hse fitting procedure conducted by computing a wide set of structural ( volume , cell shape , jt distortions , atomic positions ) electronic ( band gap and dos ) and magnetic ( spin ordering , magnetic moment ) properties as a function of @xmath2 reflects well the evolution of the screening properties across the la@xmath0o@xmath1 series represented by the dielectric function @xmath17 .    however , from a quantitative point of view the two sets of value differ by about 0.07 , as clarified graphically by the open squares in fig .",
    "[ fig : gapeps ] . in order to achieve a good quantitative match between the @xmath7 and @xmath11",
    "curves it is necessary to shift downwards the latter by about 0.07 .",
    "this behavior is attributable to two main reasons : ( i ) the relation @xmath18 identifies a proportionality between @xmath19 and @xmath10 , not an exact equality ( the factor of proportionality is not exactly 1 , as discussed in refs . ) ; ( ii ) as already mentioned before , eq . [ eq : alpha ] holds for standard _ unscreened _ hybrid functionals such as pbe0 .",
    "hse is a range - separated screened hybrid functional which contains already a certain degree of screening ( controlled by the screening factor @xmath20 ) .",
    "therefore it is expected that the optimum @xmath2 derived for pbe0 ( @xmath21 ) will be smaller than the corresponding @xmath20-dependent hse value ( @xmath7 ) @xcite . needless to say ,",
    "that in absence of a systematic study of the role of @xmath20 it is very difficult to quantify its effect on @xmath7 .",
    "we leave this issue open for future studies .",
    "recently , alkauskas _ et al .",
    "_ has proposed that an optimal mixing coefficient can generally be found for any material using the formula@xcite :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 and @xmath24 indicate the experimental and semilocal ( gga / lda ) band gap , and @xmath25 ( @xmath26(@xmath2 ) represents the variation of the band gap as a function of @xmath2)@xcite .",
    "this practical relation takes advantage of the linear relation between @xmath26 and @xmath2 , which holds true as long as the valence band maxima and conduction band minimum ( and their associated wave functions ) do not change much by changing @xmath2@xcite . in practice ,",
    "if the experimental bang gap is known , it is sufficient to perform only one hybrid functional calculation for an arbitrary value of @xmath2 plus one semilocal calculation to derive the optimum value of @xmath2 .",
    "clearly , this empirical procedure does not guarantee that the so obtained optimum @xmath2 is the best choice for what concerns the other ground state properties .",
    "we have already addressed this issue for latio@xmath1 for which @xmath2=0.1 give the best band gap but leads to the incorrect magnetic ordering .",
    "the changes of the bang gap as a function of @xmath2 for the series lasco@xmath1-lacoo@xmath1 are reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : gap ] .",
    "the linearity is well preserved for most of the materials with the exception of the small band gap compounds latio@xmath1 and lacoo@xmath1 for which a sudden change of @xmath25 is observed for a critical value of @xmath2 . a departure from linearity",
    "is also found for the jt / mh insulator lamno@xmath1 if we adopt the fully relaxed structure ( full line ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the cooperative jt distortions , which contribute to the opening of the band gap , do not change linearly with @xmath2 ( as such , the associated wave function will change with @xmath2 ) . indeed , by keeping the atomic coordinates fixed to the experimental positions the gap grows linearly by increasing @xmath2 ( dashed line ) .",
    "the values of @xmath27 obtained from this set of curves are indicated with empty ( red ) circles and included in table [ tab:19 ] .",
    "for some materials we provide more than one optimum mixing parameter since different experimental gaps are reported in literature ( see previous section ) . not surprisingly , we find that the values of @xmath27 are very similar to the corresponding @xmath7 data , with the exception of latio@xmath1 and to a lesser extent lamno@xmath1 , and correlates well with @xmath11 , as visualized in fig .",

    "[ fig : trend ] is rather complex and in line with the earlier observation of arima@xcite : we observe a general tendency of the mh gap to increase as the tm atomic number increases , whereas the ct gaps follow an opposite behavior .",

    "the gradual filling of this @xmath3 manifold leads to a continuous increase of the band width from @xmath50 ( latio@xmath1 ) to @xmath51 ( lacro@xmath1 ) , connected with a gradual increase of the crystal field splitting . in lamno@xmath1 the fully occupied @xmath3 band is pushed down in energy and the valence band maxima is dominated by the half - filled @xmath52 subbands .",
    "the @xmath53 orbital gets completely filled in lafeo@xmath1 which is the last member of the series having a predominantly mh gap .",
    "the inclusion of one additional electron yields a sudden change of the bandstructure manifested by a high increase of @xmath54-@xmath5 hybridization and bandwidth around e@xmath55 . which finally lead to the onset of a metallic state in lanio@xmath1 and lacuo@xmath1 .",
    "three members of the la@xmath0o@xmath1 family ( latio@xmath1 , lavo@xmath1 , and lamno@xmath1 ) are known to display orbital - ordering ( oo ) associated with the partially filled @xmath3 and @xmath56 orbitals located on top of the valence band ( these states are demarcated by thick lines in fig .",

    "\\(i ) in latio@xmath1 , where the oo originates from the single @xmath3 electron , the lobes have a quasi cigar - like shape with asymmetric contributions along the two main directions , indicating an almost identical occupation of the three @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 @xmath3 shells .",

    "there is a clear connection between this chessboard - like ti @xmath60 ordering and the jt structural instability , which is manifested by the tendency of the occupied @xmath3 state to lie along the longer ti - o bond .",
    "this also explains why the chessboard - like oo in latio@xmath1 is not as much evident as in lamno@xmath1 : in latio@xmath1 the difference between the distinct ti - o bondlengths ti - o@xmath61 ti - o@xmath62 ti - o@xmath63 , quantified by the jt parameters q@xmath42 and q@xmath1 , is about one order of magnitude smaller than in lamno@xmath1 ( see table [ tab:2 ] and table [ tab:5 ] ) .",
    "\\(ii ) the v@xmath64 ions in lavo@xmath1 can accommodate two electrons in the three possible orbital states @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .",
    "the spins are arranged according to the c - type ordering , whereas the oo state is found to be g - type , in accordance with the goodenough - kanamori rules@xcite and in agreement with x - ray diffraction@xcite and previous gga@xcite and hf@xcite calculations .",
    "the distribution of the @xmath3 orbitals in the g - type oo state follows the cooperative jt - induced v - o bond - alternation in the xy plane and along the z axis , i.e. the @xmath3 charge density in one specific v site is rotated by 90@xmath68 with respect to that in the 6 neighboring v sites ( four in - plane and two in the adjacent vertical planes ) . as already observed for latio@xmath1 , the @xmath3 orbitals are preferentially occupied along the long - bond direction .",
