    "a classical problem on the field of interacting particle systems corresponds to the derivation of a scaling limit for the stationary fluctuations of the conserved quantities of the system .",
    "the archetypical example is the _ exclusion process _ , which we describe as follows .",
    "the exclusion process is a system of particles on a given graph , on which each particle performs a continuous - time random walk with the restriction that each site on the graph is allowed to have at most one particle . despite its simplicity",
    ", the richness of this process makes of it one of the favorite models on the realm of interacting particle systems . in these notes",
    ", we consider the exclusion process with _ long jumps _ on the one - dimensional lattice , introduced in @xcite . in this case , the transition rates of the underlying random walk have a polynomial tail of the form @xmath5 for some @xmath6 , where @xmath7 depends on the sign of @xmath2 .",
    "the bernoulli product measures @xmath8 of density @xmath9 $ ] on @xmath10 are invariant under the evolution of this process , reflecting the fact that particles are neither created nor destroyed by the dynamics and the translation invariance of the transition rates . in these notes",
    ", we will study the stationary _ density fluctuations _ of the exclusion process with long jumps starting from @xmath8 . for @xmath11 , we show that the scaling limit of the density fluctuations are given by the infinite - dimensional ornstein - uhlenbeck equation @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a brownian motion , @xmath14 is the generator of an @xmath15-stable skewed lvy process given in , @xmath16 is its adjoint and @xmath17 is the symmetric part of @xmath18 . in the case @xmath19 we prove that the density fluctuation field is tight and any limit point is an energy solution of the _ fractional burgers equation _",
    "@xmath20 where @xmath21 is the mean of the underlying transition rate .",
    "the notion of energy solution of the previous equation was introduced in @xcite in the context of the kpz equation @xmath22 the fractional burgers equation was introduced in @xcite in finite volume and the notion of energy solutions was used to prove existence of solutions of this equation . recently in @xcite , uniqueness of such solutions has been proved in the stationary case .",
    "this result , combined with the results in @xcite complete the proof of the weak kpz universality conjecture in the stationary case .",
    "however , the methods of @xcite do not generalize to the fractional burgers equation . in the past few years , a great deal of research around the kpz / burgers equation and",
    "its universality class has been done ; see @xcite for a review .",
    "a fundamental breakthrough on the mathematical understanding of the wellposedness of the kpz equation has been given in @xcite , settling on firm grounds questions about existence and uniqueness of solutions of the kpz equation .",
    "at least heuristically , the theory of regularity structures gives uniqueness of solutions for the fractional burgers equation in the regime @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "however , the theory of regularity structures , in its current formulation , breaks down exactly at @xmath19 , which is the parameter where our fractional burgers equation appears .",
    "+ the main motivation for these notes comes from the _ strong kpz universality conjecture _ , which , roughly speaking , states that there is a universal object ( the kpz fixed point ) that governs the fluctuations of stationary , non - equilibrium , conservative , one - dimensional stochastic models .",
    "starting from various physical considerations , one important property of this universal object is its scale invariance with respect to the kpz space - time scaling @xmath24 .",
    "the fractional burgers equation is invariant under this scaling , and therefore it provides a candidate for , at least , the equation satisfied by the kpz fixed point . as far as we know , this is the first example of a non - linear equation with a meaningful notion of solution , obtained as a scaling limit of a stochastic , conservative system , which is invariant under the kpz scaling . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors propose another candidate for the kpz fixed point .",
    "however , it seems that even the existence of the object defined in @xcite is not proved rigorously .",
    "+ our method of proof is an improvement over the proof carried out in @xcite , where the finite - range case is treated .",
    "the main technical novelty is the treatment of the non - local part of the drift , which requires a multiscale analysis which is different from the one introduced in @xcite and similar to the one introduced in @xcite .",
    "the idea taken from @xcite is the following .",
    "consider for simplicity a local observable of the dynamics , it could be , for example , the occupation number at the origin . due to the conservation of the number of particles and the ergodicity of the dynamics",
    ", the local density of particles is the observable of the dynamics which takes more time to equilibrate .",
    "therefore , if we look at the evolution on the right space - time scale , any observable of the dynamics should be asymptotically equivalent to a function of the density of particles on a block of , a macroscopical , small size around the support of the observable .",
    "the boltzmann - gibbs principle introduced in @xcite states that , at first order , this function is _ linear _ on the density of particles ; a claim supported by the equivalence of ensembles .",
    "the second - order boltzmann - gibbs principle introduced in @xcite , states that the second - order correction term is a _",
    "quadratic _ function of the local density of particles .",
    "this allows to replace any _ local _ function of the dynamics by the corresponding function of the local density of particles . in these notes , the drift is a non - local function , and the multiscale analysis introduced in @xcite is not enough to handle this non - local function , so we introduce a second multiscale which , combined with the original one , allows to replace the drift by a quadratic function of the local density of particles . for @xmath25 , this sophisticated method is not needed and the fluctuations can be obtained by means of classical methods . for @xmath26 , one step of the multiscale analysis of @xcite",
    "is needed , so the proof is not very different from the case @xmath25 . for @xmath27",
    ", the multiscale analysis shows that the drift term vanishes in the limit , which is the reason why the ornstein - uhlenbeck equation is the limit in those cases .",
    "the division between the cases @xmath28 and @xmath29 is rather artificial , and it is done just to emphasize that in order to obtain our result in full generality , it is necessary to introduce new ideas , which come , in these notes , in the form of a refined multiscale analysis . for @xmath4",
    "the drift makes its way up to the limit , in the form of a quadratic functional of the limiting field .",
    "this quadratic functional is extremely singular , and it is the source of trouble for the stochastic burgers equation . only after @xcite we have been able to understand how to set up correctly a well - posed cauchy problem for the ( local ) stochastic burgers equation .",
    "the theory of regularity structures works thanks to the following heuristic observation : the scaling of the nonlinearity of the equation is subcritical , with respect to the scaling of the linear part .",
    "therefore , the theory of regularity structures makes possible to set up a picard iteration scheme to solve it .",
    "this observation is no longer true for the fractional burgers equation : the equation is _ critical _ , in the sense that , the nonlinear part and the linear part scale in the same way .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that we are not able to obtain a full convergence result for @xmath4 .",
    "notice , however , that we have enough information about limit points to show that they are well defined as stochastic processes , that the nonlinearity is well defined in a strong sense , and that they solve a martingale formulation of the fractional burgers equation .",
    "+ these notes are organized as follows . in section [ s1 ]",
    "we define the exclusion process with long jumps and we make precise formulations of the main results of the article .",
    "these formulations require a great deal of previous definitions , which are carried out along the section .",
    "in particular we need to define what do we understand by stationary solutions of the fractional ornstein - uhlenbeck equation and by stationary energy solutions of the fractional burgers equation .",
    "a great deal of care is needed at this point .",
    "it is natural to consider the density fluctuation field as a distribution - valued stochastic process .",
    "therefore , its action is well defined for test functions in the schwartz space @xmath30 . but @xmath30 is not left invariant by @xmath18 . recall that the operator @xmath18 is given in .",
    "in fact , for most functions @xmath31 , @xmath32 does not belong to @xmath30 .",
    "this fact is easy to verify in fourier space .",
    "but stationary processes are stochastically continuous in @xmath33 , which allows to define their action over functions in @xmath33 through suitable approximations .",
    "+ the general strategy of proof of the main results of these notes is not difficult to describe .",
    "our definitions of solutions use martingale characterizations .",
    "therefore , we will verify that the density fluctuations satisfy an approximate martingale problem , which , in the limit , becomes the martingale problem associated to the corresponding limiting processes .",
    "the passage to the limit is allowed by tightness arguments , complemented by some uniform estimates on the errors of the approximation .",
    "+ in section [ s2 ] we define and compute various martingales associated to the density fluctuation fields , which will be used to show that the density fluctuation fields satisfy an approximated version of the martingale problem defined for the limiting processes .",
    "+ in sections [ sec : tight_ini_field ] , [ sec : tight_mart ] and [ sec : tight_integral ] we prove tightness of some terms in the martingale decomposition of the density fluctuation field , which work out for any @xmath34 . the crucial part is to deal with the drift term @xmath35 . in section [ s3.1 ] we prove tightness of @xmath35 in the case @xmath25 .",
    "this case is a good warm - up to what follows next , since the standard proof found , for example , in chapter 11 of @xcite works well . + in section [ s3.2 ] we prove tightness of @xmath35 in the case @xmath36 . in this section we also state an estimate on the variance of additive functionals of the processes of kipnis - varadhan s type and we use the spectral gap inequality , stated in appendix [ ap : a ] , in order to transform it into an effective estimate , stated as proposition [ p2.3.4 ] .",
    "we point out that once we have established proposition [ p2.3.4 ] , the text is completely independent of the kipnis - varadhan s inequality or of the spectral gap inequality . in particular ,",
    "if , by some other means , we were able to prove proposition [ p2.3.4 ] , the results of these notes follow without needing these inequalities .",
    "we also state the form of the equivalence of ensembles that will be needed in the proofs and we show how to use proposition [ p2.3.4 ] in order to get estimates on the variance of the drift term .",
    "we only have at our disposal a brute - force cauchy - schwarz estimate to deal with the tail part of the drift term . in this way we can show the asymptotic negligibility of jumps of size bigger than @xmath37 , see lemma [ lem_1 ] .",
    "this jump size corresponds to macroscopical small jumps .",
    "the smaller jumps can be handled with proposition [ p2.3.4 ] .",
    "a single use of this proposition is enough to fill the gap up to @xmath37 , only for @xmath38 , so a more refined argument is needed for the general case . + in section [ s3.3 ]",
    "we prove tightness for @xmath39 . in this case",
    "we need to introduce a multiscale analysis in order to use in an effective way proposition [ p2.3.4 ] .",
    "the idea is the following .",
    "proposition [ p2.3.4 ] allows to estimate the variance of space - time additive functionals of the dynamics by their spatial variance , paying as a price the inverse of the spectral gap over the support of the spatial functions in consideration .",
    "therefore , the largest the support of the functions we consider , the less effective proposition [ p2.3.4 ] is .",
    "the current associated to big jumps has a very big support , but its variance decays with the distance as a power law .",
    "therefore , there is a trade - off between the support and the intensity of a big jump .",
    "the right way to exploit this trade - off is through a multiscale analysis . + in section [ s3.4 ] we prove tightness for @xmath4 .",
    "although the multiscale analysis of section [ s3.3 ] still makes big jumps negligible , very small jumps are no longer negligible and a new argument is needed .",
    "the multiscale analysis of section [ s3.3 ] stops at size @xmath40 for some small @xmath41 and it shows that the drift term is asymptotically equivalent to the square of the density on a box of size @xmath40 .",
    "this is what is called the _ one - block estimate _ in the literature of interacting particle systems . using the renormalization scheme introduced in @xcite",
    ", we show the _ two - blocks estimate _ , which states that the drift term is asymptotically equivalent to the square of the density on a box of size @xmath42 .",
    "this method shows a uniform @xmath43-bound for the difference between the drift term and the square of the density , which is good enough to prove tightness by means of the kolmogorov - centsov s criterion stated in proposition [ kcc ] .",
    "+ in section [ s3.5 ] we show theorem [ t1.5.1 ] , that is the convergence of the density fluctuation field to the stationary solution of the fractional ornstein - uhlenbeck equation . once tightness is proved , the proof is standard and relies on the martingale characterization of such solutions . in section [ s3.6 ]",
    "we show theorem [ t1.6.2 ] , which is also not very difficult to prove once the uniform bound is obtained .",
    "+ section [ s6.1 ] contains a discussion about how the main result of this article is related to the so - called _ kpz universality _ conjecture .",
    "it turns out that energy solutions of are invariant under the kpz scaling exponents @xmath24 .",
    "it can be checked that , at a formal level , modulo space - time rescalings , stationary solutions of equation form a two - parameter family of self - similar processes , each of them invariant under the kpz scaling .",
    "it has been conjectured ( see @xcite for example ) that fluctuations of one - dimensional growth interfaces converge to a universal process , dubbed the _ kpz fixed point_. this object should also be invariant with respect to the kpz scaling .",
    "another universality class that also has the kpz scaling exponents is the scaling limit of energy fluctuations of one - dimensional stochastic models of heat conduction in the so - called _ zero pressure point_. in that case , the limiting process is the ornstein - uhlenbeck process associated to the fractional laplacian @xmath18 , which corresponds to with @xmath44 see @xcite .",
    "the stability index @xmath45 appears naturally in the solution of a two - dimensional poisson equation involving local operators .",
    "the skewness parameter depends on the details of the model and it can have any admissible value .",
    "we conjecture that the family of solutions of converges , as @xmath46 and after a proper time scaling , to the kpz fixed point .",
    "we say in that case that between the gaussian case @xmath44 and the kpz fixed point . in @xcite",
    ", it is proved that the kpz equation can be understood a _",
    "crossover _ between the ornstein - uhlenbeck process associated to the usual laplacian and the kpz fixed point .",
    "these two universality classes have different scaling exponents , and in particular the kpz equation is not scale invariant .",
    "therefore , our conjecture is conceptually different , since all the interpolating processes have the same scaling exponents .",
    "+ section [ s6.2 ] explains how to obtain the fractional burgers equation associated to the fractional laplacian @xmath47 as a scaling limit of a family of asymmetric exclusion processes .",
    "since the limiting equation is not scale invariant for @xmath48 , one has to tune the strength of the asymmetry with respect to the scaling . for @xmath49 ,",
    "the strength of the asymmetry decreases with @xmath50 ( we say that the system is _ weakly asymmetric _ ) , and for @xmath51 the strength of the asymmetry increases with @xmath50",
    ". + section [ s6.3 ] explains how to extend the results of this paper to the case on which the jump rates belong to the domain of em normal attraction of an @xmath15-stable law .",
    "+ finally , section [ s6.4 ] gives some examples of particle systems with long - range interactions for which the methods of this article allow to prove the results stated in this article .",
    "in this section we describe what it is known in the literature as the _ exclusion process _ on the one - dimensional lattice @xmath52 .",
    "we say that a function @xmath53 is a _ transition rate _ if @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",

    "we say that there is a particle at the site @xmath62 if @xmath63 ; otherwise we say that the site @xmath62 is _",
    "empty_. let us consider the following dynamics .",
    "each particle waits an exponential time of rate @xmath64 ( for this reason we ask @xmath64 to be finite ) , at the end of which it chooses a site @xmath65 with probability @xmath66 , where @xmath62 is the current position of the particle .",
    "if the chosen site is empty , the particle jumps into it .",
    "otherwise it stays at its current position . in any case , a new exponential time starts afresh and the particle repeats the steps above .",
    "the dynamics described above corresponds to a markov process @xmath67 defined on @xmath58 .",

    "notice that we are not assuming anything about @xmath56 aside from @xmath70 .",
    "in particular , we can assume that particles perform arbitrarily long jumps with positive probability , which is the case we are interested in on these notes .",
