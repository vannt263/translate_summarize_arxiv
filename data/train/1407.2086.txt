    "a nonlocal quantum field theory and quantum gravity theory has been formulated that leads to a finite , unitary and locally gauge invariant theory  @xcite . for quantum gravity",

    "an important feature of the field theory is _ that only the quantum loop graphs have nonlocal properties _ ; the classical tree graph theory retains full causal and local behavior .",
    "consider first the 4-dimensional spacetime to be approximately flat minkowski spacetime .",
    "let us denote by @xmath2 a generic local field and write the standard local lagrangian as @xmath3={\\cal l}_f[f]+{\\cal l}_i[f],\\ ] ] where @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the free part and the interaction part of the action , respectively , and @xmath6=\\frac{1}{2}f_i{\\cal k}_{ij}f_j.\\ ] ] in a gauge theory the action would be the becchi , rouet , stora , tyutin ( brst ) gauge - fixed action including ghost fields in the invariant action required to fix the gauge  @xcite .",

    "amplitudes the first such term cancels the contribution from the corresponding lower order channel , while the second term is just the usual local field theory result for that channel .",
    "the action is then invariant under an extended nonlocal gauge transformation .",
    "the precise results for qed were described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the regularized action is found by expanding @xmath18 in an infinite series of interaction terms . since @xmath12 and @xmath15 are entire function of @xmath7 the higher interactions are also entire functions of @xmath7 .",
    "this is important for preserving the cutkosky rules and unitarity , for an entire function does not possess any singularities in the finite complex momentum plane .",
    "the feynman rules are obtained as follows : every leg of a diagram is connected to a local propagator , @xmath19 and every vertex has a form factor @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the momentum attached to the propagator @xmath22 , which has the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the particle nature of the external leg in the vertex .",
    "the formalism is set up in minkowski spacetime and loop integrals are formally defined in euclidean space by performing a wick rotation .",
    "this facilitates the analytic continuation ; the whole formalism could from the outset be developed in euclidean space .",
    "we will demonstrate how the nonlocal transcendental entire function in momentum space that generates the finite and unitary standard model ( sm ) and quantum gravity ( qg ) loops to all orders of perturbation theory , produces an exponential suppression of the estimated very large vacuum density and cosmological constant in local quantum field theory .",
    "this can solve the severe fine - tuning cosmological constant problem , avoiding a naturalness problem and the need for an anthropic and multiverse solution .",
    "we expand the metric around a smooth fixed background spacetime : @xmath25 by restricting ourselves to perturbation theory and a fixed geometrical background , we lose general covariance ( diffeomorphism invariance ) .",

    "although we lose general covariance in our perturbation calculations of gravitational scattering amplitudes , the basic physical properties such as finiteness of loop amplitudes , gauge invariance and unitarity will be expected to lead to correct and reliable physical conclusions . for the sake of simplicity",
