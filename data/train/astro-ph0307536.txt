    "since their discovery in 1967 @xcite , radio pulsars have provided insights into physics on length scales covering the range from 1 m ( giant pulses from the crab pulsar @xcite ) to 10 km ( neutron star ) to kpc ( galactic ) to hundreds of mpc ( cosmological ) .",
    "pulsars present an extreme stellar environment , with matter at nuclear densities , magnetic fields of 10@xmath0 g to nearly 10@xmath1 g , and spin periods ranging from 1.5ms to 8.5s .",
    "the regular pulses received from a pulsar each correspond to a single rotation of the neutron star .",
    "it is by measuring the deviations from perfect observed regularity that information can be derived about the neutron star itself , the interstellar medium between it and the earth , and effects due to gravitational interaction with binary companion stars .",
    "in particular , pulsars have proved to be remarkably successful laboratories for tests of the predictions of general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "the tests of gr that are possible through pulsar timing fall into two broad categories : setting limits on the magnitudes of parameters that describe violation of equivalence principles , often using an ensemble of pulsars , and verifying that the measured post - keplerian timing parameters of a given binary system match the predictions of strong - field gr better than those of other theories .",
    "long - term millisecond pulsar timing can also be used to set limits on the stochastic gravitational - wave background ( e.g. , @xcite ) , as can limits on orbital variability in binary pulsars for even lower wave frequencies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however these are not tests of the same type of precise prediction of gr and will not be discussed here .",
    "this review will present a brief overview of the properties of pulsars and the mechanics of deriving timing models , and will then proceed to describe the various types of tests of gr made possible by both single and binary pulsars .",
    "the properties and demographics of pulsars , as well as pulsar search and timing techniques , are thoroughly covered in the article by lorimer in this series @xcite .",
    "this section will present only an overview of the topics most important to understanding the application of pulsar observations to tests of gr .",
    "radio pulsars were firmly established as being neutron stars with the discovery of the pulsar in the crab nebula @xcite ; its 33-ms period was too fast to permit a pulsating or rotating white dwarf , leaving a rotating neutron star as the only surviving model @xcite .",
    "the 1982 discovery of a 1.5-ms pulsar , psr  b1937 + 21 @xcite , led to the realization that , in addition to the `` young '' crab - like pulsars born in recent supernovae , there exists a separate class of older `` millisecond '' or `` recycled '' pulsars , which have been spun up to faster periods by accretion of matter and angular momentum from an evolving companion star .",
    "see , for example , @xcite and @xcite for reviews of the evolution of such binary systems .",
    "it is precisely these recycled pulsars that form the most valuable resource for tests of gr .    #",
    "1#20.4#1    the exact mechanism by which a pulsar radiates the energy observed as radio pulses is still a subject of vigorous debate .",
    "the basic picture of a misaligned magnetic dipole , with coherent radiation from charged particles accelerated along the open field lines above the polar cap @xcite , will serve adequately for the purposes of this article , in which pulsars are treated as a tool to probe other physics . while individual pulses fluctuate severely in both intensity and shape ( see fig .",
    "[ figure : indiv ] ) , a profile `` integrated '' over several hundred or thousand pulses ( i.e. , a few minutes ) yields a shape  a `` standard profile ''  that is reproducible for a given pulsar at a given frequency .",
    "( there is generally some evolution of pulse profiles with frequency , but this can usually be taken into account . )",
    "it is the reproducibility of time - averaged profiles that permits high - precision timing .    of some importance later in this article will be models of the pulse beam _ shape _ , the envelope function which forms the standard profile .",
    "the collection of pulse profile shapes and polarization properties have been used to formulate phenomenological descriptions of the pulse emission regions . at the simplest level ( e.g. , reference  @xcite and other papers in that series )",
    ", the classifications can be broken down into gaussian - shaped `` core '' regions with little linear polarization and some circular polarization , and double - peaked `` cone '' regions with stronger linear polarization and s - shaped position angle swings in accordance with the `` rotating vector model '' ( rvm ; see @xcite ) .",
    "while these models prove helpful for evaluating observed changes in the profiles of pulsars undergoing geodetic precession , there are ongoing disputes in the literature as to whether the core / cone split is physically meaningful , or whether both types of emission are simply due to patchy strength of a single emission region ( e.g. , @xcite ) .      # 1#20.4#1    a short description of pulsar observing techniques is in order .",
    "as pulsars have quite steep radio spectra ( e.g.,@xcite ) , they are strongest at frequencies @xmath2 of a few hundred mhz . at these frequencies ,",
    "the propagation of the radio wave through the ionized interstellar medium ( ism ) can have quite serious effects on the observed pulse .",
    "multipath scattering will cause the profile to be convolved with an exponential tail , blurring the sharp profile edges needed for the best timing .",
    "figure  [ figure:1740scatt ] shows an example of scattering ; the effect decreases with sky frequency as roughly @xmath3 ( e.g. , @xcite ) and thus affects timing precision less at higher observing frequencies .",
    "a related effect is scintillation : interference between the rays traveling along the different paths causes time- and frequency - dependent peaks and valleys in the pulsar s signal strength .",
    "the decorrelation bandwidth , across which the signal is observed to have roughly equal strength , is related to the scattering time and scales as @xmath4 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there is little any instrument can do to compensate for these effects ; wide observing bandwidths at relatively high frequencies and generous observing time allocations are the only ways to combat these problems .    #",
    "1#20.4#1    another important effect induced by the ism is the dispersion of the traveling pulses .",
    "acting as a tenuous electron plasma , the ism causes the wavenumber of a propagating wave to become frequency - dependent . by calculating the group velocity of each frequency component ,",
    "it is easy to show ( e.g.,@xcite ) that lower frequencies will arrive at the telescope later in time than the higher - frequency components , following a @xmath5 law .",
    "the magnitude of the delay is completely characterized by the dispersion measure ( dm ) , the integrated electron content along the line of sight between the pulsar and the earth . all low - frequency pulsar observing instrumentation is required to address this dispersion problem if the goal is to obtain profiles suitable for timing .",
    "one standard approach is to split the observing bandpass into a multichannel `` filterbank , '' to detect the signal in each channel , and then to realign the channels following the @xmath5 law when integrating the pulse .",
    "this method is certainly adequate for slow pulsars and often for nearby millisecond pulsars .",
    "however , when the ratio of the pulse period to its dm becomes small , much sharper profiles can be obtained by sampling the voltage signals from the telescope prior to detection , and convolving the resulting time series with the inverse of the easily calculated frequency - dependent filter imposed by the ism . as a result",
    ", the pulse profile is perfectly aligned in frequency , without any residual dispersive smearing caused by finite channel bandwidths .",
    "as well , full - stokes information can be obtained without significant increase in analysis time , allowing accurate polarization plots to be easily derived",
    ". this `` coherent dedispersion '' technique @xcite is now in widespread use across normal observing bandwidths of several tens of mhz , thanks to the availability of inexpensive fast computing power ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "some of the highest - precision experiments described below have used this approach to collect their data .",
    "figure  [ figure : cdedisp ] illustrates the advantages of this technique .      once dispersion has been removed , the resultant time series is typically folded modulo the expected pulse period , in order to build up the signal strength over several minutes and to obtain a stable time - averaged profile",
    ". the pulse period may not be very easily predicted from the discovery period , especially if the pulsar happens to be in a binary system .",
    "the goal of pulsar timing is to develop a model of the pulse phase as a function of time , so that all future pulse arrival times can be predicted with a good degree of accuracy .",
    "the profile accumulated over several minutes is compared by cross - correlation with the `` standard profile '' for the pulsar at that observing frequency .",
    "a particularly efficient version of the cross - correlation algorithm compares the two profiles in the frequency domain @xcite .",
    "once the phase shift of the observed profile relative to the standard profile is known , that offset is added to the start time of the observation in order to yield a `` time of arrival '' ( toa ) that is representative of that few - minute integration . in practice",
    ", observers frequently use a time- and phase - stamp near the middle of the integration in order to minimize systematic errors due to a poorly known pulse period . as a rule ,",
    "pulse timing precision is best for bright pulsars with short spin periods , narrow profiles with steep edges , and little if any profile corruption due to interstellar scattering .    with a collection of toas in hand , it becomes possible to fit a model of the pulsar s timing behaviour , accounting for every rotation of the neutron star .",
    "based on the magnetic dipole model @xcite , the pulsar is expected to lose rotational energy and thus `` spin down '' .",
    "the primary component of the timing model is therefore a taylor expansion of the pulse phase @xmath6 with time @xmath7 : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are a reference phase and time , respectively , and the pulse frequency @xmath11 is the time derivative of the pulse phase .",
    "note that the fitted parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 and the magnetic dipole model can be used to derive an estimate of the surface magnetic field @xmath13 : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the inclination angle between the pulsar spin axis and the magnetic dipole axis , @xmath16 is the radius of the neutron star , about 10@xmath17 cm , and the moment of inertia is @xmath18g@xmath19 . in turn , integration of the energy loss , along with the assumption that the pulsar was born with infinite spin frequency , yields a `` characteristic age '' @xmath20 for the pulsar : @xmath21      equation  [ equation : phase ] refers to pulse frequencies and times in a reference frame that is inertial relative to the pulsar .",
    "toas derived in the rest frame of a telescope on the earth must therefore be translated to such a reference frame before equation  [ equation : phase ] can be applied .",
    "the best approximation available for an inertial reference frame is that of the solar system barycentre ( ssb ) .",
    "even this is not perfect ; many of the tests of gr described below require correcting for the small relative accelerations of the ssb and the centre - of - mass frames of binary pulsar systems .",
    "but certainly for the majority of pulsars it is adequate .",
    "the required transformation between a toa at the telescope , @xmath22 , and the emission time @xmath7 from the pulsar is : @xmath23 here @xmath24 accounts for the dispersive delay in seconds of the observed pulse relative to infinite frequency ; the parameter @xmath25 is derived from the pulsar s dispersion measure by @xmath26 hz , with dm in units of pc@xmath27 and the observing frequency @xmath28 in mhz .",
    "the roemer term , @xmath29 , takes out the travel time across the solar system based on the relative positions of the pulsar and the telescope , including , if needed , the proper motion and parallax of the pulsar .",
    "the einstein delay , @xmath30 , accounts for the time dilation and gravitational redshift due to the sun and other masses in the solar system , while the shapiro delay , @xmath31 , expresses the excess delay to the pulsar signal as it travels through the gravitational well of the sun  a maximum delay of about 120@xmath32s at the limb of the sun ; see @xcite for a fuller discussion of these terms .",
    "the terms @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 in equation  [ equation : orbit ] account for similar `` roemer '' , `` einstein '' and `` shapiro '' delays within the pulsar binary system , if needed , and will be discussed in section  [ section : binary ] below .",
    "most observers accomplish the model fitting , accounting for these delay terms , using the program tempo @xcite .",
    "the correction of toas to the reference frame of the ssb requires an accurate ephemeris for the solar system .",
    "the most commonly used ephemeris is the `` de200 '' standard from the jet propulsion laboratory @xcite .",
    "it is also clear that accurate time - keeping is of primary importance in pulsar modeling .",
    "general practice is to derive the time - stamp on each observation from the observatory s local time standard  typically a hydrogen maser  and to apply , retroactively , corrections to well - maintained time standards such as utc(bipm ) , universal coordinated time as maintained by the bureau international des poids et mesures in paris .",
    "the terms @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 in equation  [ equation : orbit ] describe the `` roemer '' , `` einstein '' and `` shapiro '' delays within a pulsar binary system .",
    "the majority of binary pulsar orbits are adequately described by five keplerian parameters : the orbital period @xmath36 , the projected semi - major axis @xmath37 , the eccentricity @xmath38 , and the longitude @xmath39 and epoch @xmath40 of periastron .",
    "the angle @xmath39 is measured from the line of nodes , @xmath41 , where the pulsar orbit intersects the plane of the sky . in many cases , one or more relativistic corrections to the keplerian parameters",
    "must also be fit .",
    "early relativistic timing models , developed in the first years after the discovery of psr  b1913 + 16 , either did not provide a full description of the orbit ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or else did not define the timing parameters in a way that allowed deviations from gr to be easily identified ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the best modern timing model @xcite ) incorporates a number of `` post - keplerian '' timing parameters which are included in the description of the three delay terms , and which can be fit in a completely phenomenological manner .",
    "the delays are defined primarily in terms of the phase of the orbit , defined by the eccentric anomaly @xmath42 and true anomaly @xmath43 , as well as @xmath39 , @xmath36 and their possible time derivatives .",
    "these are related by : @xmath44 , \\label{eqn : eccen_anom}\\ ] ] @xmath45 , \\label{eqn : true_anom}\\ ] ] @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the reference value of @xmath39 at time @xmath40 .",
    "the delay terms then become : @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 \\right\\}.\\ , \\label{equation : deltas}\\ ] ] here @xmath51 represents the combined time dilation and gravitational redshift due to the pulsar s orbit , and @xmath52 and @xmath53 are , respectively , the range and shape of the shapiro delay . together with the orbital period derivative @xmath54 and the advance of periastron @xmath55 , they make up the post - keplerian timing parameters that can be fit for various pulsar binaries . a fuller description of the timing model also includes the aberration parameters @xmath56 and @xmath57 , but these parameters are not in general separately measurable .",
    "the interpretation of the measured post - keplerian timing parameters will be discussed in the context of double - neutron - star tests of gr in section  [ section : strong_field ] .",
    "equivalence principles are fundamental to gravitational theory ; for full descriptions see e.g. , @xcite or @xcite .",
    "newton formulated what may be considered the earliest such principle , now called the `` weak equivalence principle '' ( wep ) .",
    "it states that in an external gravitational field , objects of different compositions and masses will experience the same acceleration .",
    "the einstein equivalence principle ( eep ) includes this concept as well as those of lorentz invariance ( non - existence of preferred reference frames ) and positional invariance ( non - existence of preferred locations ) for non - gravitational experiments .",
    "this principle leads directly to the conclusion that non - gravitational experiments will have the same outcomes in inertial and in freely - falling reference frames .",
    "the strong equivalence principle ( sep ) adds lorentz and positional invariance for gravitational experiments , thus including experiments on objects with strong self - gravitation .",
    "as gr incorporates the sep , and other theories of gravity may violate all or parts of it , it is useful to define a formalism which allows immediate identifications of such violations .",
    "the parametrized post - newtonian ( ppn ) formalism was developed @xcite to provide a uniform description of the weak - gravitational - field limit , and to facilitate comparisons of rival theories in this limit .",
    "this formalism requires 10 parameters ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60,@xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) which are fully described in the article by will in this series @xcite and whose physical meanings are nicely summarized in table  2 of that article .",
    "( note that @xmath58 is not the same as the post - keplerian pulsar timing parameter @xmath51 . )",
    "damour and esposito - farse @xcite extended this formalism to include strong - field effects for generalized tensor - multiscalar gravitational theories .",
    "this allows a better understanding of limits imposed by systems including pulsars and white dwarfs , for which the amounts of self - gravitation are very different . here",
    ", for instance , @xmath61 becomes @xmath68 , where @xmath69 describes the `` compactness '' of mass @xmath70 .",
    "the compactness can be written @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is newton s constant and @xmath73 is the gravitational self - energy of mass @xmath70 , about @xmath74 for a neutron star ( ns ) and @xmath75 for a white dwarf ( wd ) .",
    "pulsar timing has the ability to set limits on @xmath76 , which tests for the existence of preferred - frame effects ( violations of lorentz invariance ) ; @xmath77 , which , in addition to testing for preferred - frame effects , also implies non - conservation of momentum if non - zero ; and @xmath65 , which is also a non - conservative parameter .",
    "pulsars can also be used to set limits on other sep - violation effects which constrain combinations of the ppn parameters : the nordtvedt ( `` gravitational stark '' ) effect , dipolar gravitational radiation , and variation of newton s constant .",
    "the next sections will discuss the current pulsar timing limits on each of these effects .",

    "this would result in a `` polarization '' of the orbit in the direction of the sun .",
    "llr tests have set a limit of @xmath101 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , where @xmath91 is a combination of ppn parameters : @xmath102    the strong - field formalism instead uses the parameter @xmath103 @xcite , which for object `` _ i _ '' may be written as : @xmath104 pulsar  white dwarf systems then constrain @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "if the sep is violated , the equations of motion for such a system will contain an extra acceleration @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the gravitational field of the galaxy . as the pulsar and the white dwarf fall differently in this field , this @xmath108 term will influence the evolution of the orbit of the system . for low - eccentricity orbits , by far the largest effect will be a long - term forcing of the eccentricity toward alignment with the projection of @xmath109 onto the orbital plane of the system .",
    "thus the time evolution of the eccentricity vector will not only depend on the usual gr - predicted relativistic advance of periastron ( @xmath110 ) but will also include a constant term .",
    "damour and schfer @xcite write the time - dependent eccentricity vector as : @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the @xmath110-induced rotating eccentricity vector , and @xmath113 is the forced component . in terms of @xmath92 , the magnitude of @xmath113",
    "may be written as @xcite : @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the projection of the gravitational field onto the orbital plane , and @xmath116 is the semi - major axis of the orbit . for small - eccentricity systems , this reduces to : @xmath117 where m is the total mass of the system , and , in gr , @xmath118 and @xmath72 is newton s constant .",
    "clearly , the primary criterion for selecting pulsars to test the sep is for the orbital system to have a large value of @xmath119 , greater than or equal to @xmath120 days@xmath121 @xcite .",

    "first of all , the pulsar must be sufficiently old that the @xmath122-induced rotation of @xmath123 has completed many turns and @xmath112 can be assumed to be randomly oriented .",
    "this requires that the characteristic age @xmath124 and thus young pulsars can not be used .",
    "secondly , @xmath122 itself must be larger than the rate of galactic rotation , so that the projection of @xmath107 onto the orbit can be assumed to be constant . according to wex @xcite ,",
    "this holds true for pulsars with orbital periods of less than about 1000 days .",
    "# 1#20.4#1    converting equation  [ equation : ef2 ] to a limit on @xmath125 requires some statistical arguments to deal with the unknowns in the problem .",

    "@xmath127 is assumed to have a uniform probability distribution between 0 and @xmath132 .",
    "next comes the task of estimating the projection of @xmath109 onto the orbital plane .",
    "the projection can be written as : @xmath133^{1/2 } , \\label{equation : gperp}\\ ] ] where @xmath134 in the inclination angle of the orbital plane relative to the line of sight , @xmath135 is the line of nodes and @xmath136 is the angle between the line of sight to the pulsar and @xmath109 @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath136 and @xmath137 can be determined from models of the galactic potential ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the inclination angle @xmath134 can be estimated if even crude estimates of the neutron star and companion masses are available , from statistics of ns masses ( e.g. , @xcite ) and/or a relation between the size of the orbit and the wd companion mass ( e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "however , the angle @xmath135 is also usually unknown and must also be assumed to be uniformly distributed between 0 and @xmath132 .",
    "damour and schfer @xcite use the psr  b1953 + 29 system and integrate over the angles @xmath127 and @xmath135 to determine a 90% confidence upper limit of @xmath138 .",

    "he derives @xmath139 at 95% confidence .",
    "however , this method may be vulnerable to selection effects : perhaps the observed systems are not representative of the true population .",
    "wex @xcite later overcomes this problem by inverting the question .",
    "given a value of @xmath92 , an upper limit on @xmath140 is obtained from equation  [ equation : xi1 ] .",
    "a monte carlo simulation of the expected pulsar population ( assuming a range of masses based on evolutionary models and a random orientation of @xmath135 ) then yields a certain fraction of the population that agree with this limit on @xmath140 .",
    "the collection of pulsars ultimately gives a limit of @xmath141 at 95% confidence .",
    "this is slightly weaker than wex s previous limit but derived in a more rigorous manner .",
    "prospects for improving the limits come from the discovery of new suitable pulsars , and from better limits on eccentricity from long - term timing of the current set of pulsars . in principle , measurement of the full orbital orientation ( i.e. , @xmath135 and @xmath134 ) for certain systems could reduce the dependence on statistical arguments .",
    "however , the possibility of cancellation between @xmath142 and @xmath143 will always remain .",
    "thus , even though the required angles have in fact been measured for the millisecond pulsar j0437@xmath1444715 @xcite , its comparatively large observed eccentricity of @xmath145 means it will not significantly affect the current limits .",
    "a non - zero @xmath76 implies that the velocity @xmath146 of a binary pulsar system ( relative to a `` universal '' background reference frame given by the cosmic microwave background , or cmb ) will affect its orbital evolution . in a manner similar to the effects of a non - zero @xmath92 ,",
    "the time evolution of the eccentricity will depend on both @xmath110 and a term which tries to force the semi - major axis of the orbit to align with the projection of the system velocity onto the orbital plane .",

    "examples of suitable systems are psr  j2317 + 1439 @xcite with a last published value of @xmath150 in 1996 @xcite , and psr  j1012 + 5307 , with @xmath151 @xcite .",
    "this latter system is especially valuable because observations of its white - dwarf component yield a radial velocity measurement @xcite , eliminating the need to find a lower limit on an unknown quantity .",
    "the analysis of wex @xcite yields a limit of @xmath152 .",
    "this is comparable in magnitude to the weak - field results from lunar laser ranging , but incorporates strong field effects as well .",
    "tests of @xmath77 can be derived from both binary and single pulsars , using slightly different techniques .",
    "a non - zero @xmath153 , which implies both a violation of local lorentz invariance and non - conservation of momentum , will cause a rotating body to experience a self - acceleration @xmath154 in a direction orthogonal to both its spin @xmath155 and its absolute velocity @xmath146 @xcite : @xmath156 thus the self - acceleration depends strongly on the compactness of the object , as discussed in section  [ section : sep ] above .",
    "an ensemble of single ( isolated ) pulsars can be used to set a limit on @xmath77 in the following manner . for any given pulsar ,",
    "it is likely that some fraction of the self - acceleration will be directed along the line of sight to the earth .",

    "they are best tested by combining results from psrs  b1913 + 16 , b1534 + 12 ( which contributes little to this test ) , b0655 + 64 ( limits on dipolar gravitational radiation ) and solar - system experiments ( lunar laser ranging , shapiro delay measured by viking @xcite , and the perihelion advance of mercury @xcite ) .",
    "the allowed parameter space from the combined tests is shown graphically in figure  [ figure : de98 ] @xcite .",
    "currently , for most neutron - star equations of state , the solar system tests set a limit on @xmath198 ( @xmath255 ) that is a few times more stringent than those set by psrs b1913 + 16 and b0655 + 64 , although the pulsar observations do eliminate large negative values of @xmath253 . with the limits from the pulsar observations improving only very slowly with time",
    ", it appears that solar - system tests will continue to set the strongest limits on @xmath198 in this class of theories , unless a pulsar  black hole system is discovered .",
    "if such a system were found with a @xmath256-@xmath257 black hole and an orbital period similar to that of psr  b1913 + 16 ( @xmath258 hours ) , the limit on @xmath198 derived from this system would be about 50 times tighter than that set by current solar - system tests , and 10 times better than is likely to be achieved by the gravity probe b experiment @xcite .      # 1#20.4#1    a different and complementary test of gr has recently been permitted by the millisecond pulsar psr  j0437@xmath1444715 @xcite . at a distance of only 140pc ,",
    "it is the closest millisecond pulsar to the earth @xcite , and is also extremely bright , allowing root - mean - square timing residuals of 35ns with the 64-m parkes @xcite telescope , comparable to or better than the best millisecond pulsars observed with current instruments at the 300-m arecibo telescope @xcite .",
    "the proximity of this system means that the orbital motion of the _ earth _ changes the apparent inclination angle @xmath134 of the pulsar orbit on the sky , an effect known as the annual - orbital parallax @xcite .",
    "this results in a periodic change of the projected semi - major axis @xmath37 of the pulsar s orbit , written as : @xmath259,\\ ] ] where @xmath260 is the time - dependent vector from the centre of the earth to the ssb , and @xmath261 is a vector on the plane of the sky perpendicular to the line of nodes .",
    "a second contribution to the observed @xmath134 and hence @xmath37 comes from the pulsar system s transverse motion in the plane of the sky @xcite : @xmath262 where @xmath263 is the proper motion vector . by including both these effects in the model of the pulse arrival times , both the inclination angle @xmath134 and the longitude of the ascending node @xmath135",
    "can be determined @xcite . as @xmath264 is equivalent to the shape of the shapiro delay in gr ( pk parameter @xmath53 ) , the effect of the shapiro delay on the timing residuals",
    "can then easily be computed for a range of possible companion masses ( equivalent to the pk parameter @xmath52 in gr ) .",
    "the variations in the timing residuals are well explained by a companion mass of @xmath265 ( figure  [ figure : vbb0437 ] ) .",
    "the measured value of @xmath110 , together with @xmath134 , also provides an estimate of the companion mass , @xmath266 , which is consistent with the shapiro - delay value .    while this result does not include a true self - consistency check in the manner of the double - neutron - star tests , it is nevertheless important , as it represents the only case in which an independent , purely geometric determination of the inclination angle of a binary orbit predicts the shape of the shapiro delay .",
    "it can thus be considered to provide an independent test of the predictions of gr .",
    "# 1#20.4#1    a complete discussion of gr effects in pulsar observations must mention geodetic precession , though these results are somewhat qualitative and do not ( yet ) provide a model - free test of gr . in standard evolutionary scenarios for double - neutron - star binaries ( e.g. , @xcite ) ,",
    "both stellar spins are expected to be aligned with the orbital angular momentum just before the second supernova explosion .",
    "after this event , however , the observed pulsar s spin is likely to be misaligned with the orbital angular momentum , by an angle of the order of @xmath267 @xcite .",
    "a similar misalignment may be expected when the observed pulsar is the second - formed degenerate object , as in psr  j1141@xmath1446545 . as a result , both vectors will precess about the total angular momentum of the system ( in practice the total angular momentum is completely dominated by the orbital angular momentum ) .",
    "the evolution of the pulsar spin axis @xmath268 can be written as @xcite : @xmath269 where the vector @xmath270 is aligned with the orbital angular momentum .",
    "its magnitude is given by : @xmath271 where @xmath272s , as in section  [ section : pkparms ] .",
    "this predicted rate of precession is small ; the three systems with the highest @xmath273 values are : psr  j1141@xmath1446545 at @xmath274yr@xmath99 , psr  b1913 + 16 at @xmath275yr@xmath99 and psr  b1534 + 12 at @xmath276yr@xmath99 . the primary manifestation of this precession is expected to be a slow change in the shape of the pulse profile , as different regions of the pulse emission beam move into the observable region .    # 1#20.4#1    # 1#20.4#1    # 1#20.4#1    evidence for long - term profile shape changes is in fact seen in psrs  b1913 + 16 and b1534 + 12 . for psr  b1913 + 16 ,",
    "profile shape changes were first reported in the 1980s @xcite , with a clear change in the relative heights of the two profile peaks over several years ( figure  [ figure : tw89 ] ) .",
    "no similar changes were found in the polarization of the pulsar @xcite .",
    "interestingly , although a simple picture of a cone - shaped beam might lead to an expectation of a change in the _ separation _ of the peaks with time , no evidence for this was seen until the late 1990s , at the effelsberg 100-m telescope @xcite , by which point the two peaks had begun to move closer together at a rather fast rate .",
    "kramer @xcite used this changing peak separation , along with the predicted precession rate and a simple conal model of the pulse beam , to estimate a spin - orbit misalignment angle of about @xmath277 and to predict that the pulsar will disappear from view in about 2025 ( see figure  [ figure : kra98 ] ) , in good agreement with an earlier prediction by istomin @xcite made before the peak separation began to change .",
    "recent results from arecibo @xcite confirm the gist of kramer s results , with a misalignment angle of about @xmath278 .",
    "both sets of authors find there are four degenerate solutions that can fit the profile separation data ; two can be discarded as they predict an unreasonably large misalignment angle of @xmath279 @xcite , and a third is eliminated because it predicts the wrong direction of the position angle swing under the rotating vector model @xcite .",
    "the main area of dispute is the actual shape of the emission region ; while weisberg and taylor find an hourglass - shaped beam ( see figure  [ figure : wt02 ] ) , kramer maintains that a nearly circular cone plus an offset core is adequate ( see figure  [ figure : kra_1913 ] ) . in any event , it is clear that the interpretation of the profile changes requires some kind of model of the beam shape .",
    "kramer @xcite lets the rate of precession vary as another free parameter in the pulse - shape fit , and finds a value of @xmath280 .",
    "this is consistent with the gr prediction but still depends on the beam - shape model and is therefore not a true test of the precession rate .    #",
    "1#20.4#1    psr  b1534 + 12 , despite the disadvantages of a more recent discovery and a much longer precession period , also provides clear evidence of long - term profile shape changes .",
    "these were first noticed at 1400mhz by arzoumanian @xcite and have become more obvious at this frequency and at 430mhz in the post - upgrade period at arecibo @xcite .",
    "the principal effect is a change in the low - level emission near to the main pulse ( figure  [ figure:1534evol ] ) , though related changes in polarization are now also seen . as this pulsar shows polarized emission through most of its pulse period , it should be possible to form a better picture of the overall geometry than for psr  b1913 + 16",
    "; this may make it easier to derive an accurate model of the pulse beam shape .    as for other tests of gr , the pulsar  white - dwarf binary psr  j1141@xmath1446545 promises interesting results . as noted by the discoverers @xcite ,",
    "the region of sky containing this pulsar had been observed at the same frequency in an earlier survey @xcite , but the pulsar was not seen , even though it is now very strong .",
    "it is possible that interference corrupted that original survey pointing , or that a software error prevented its detection , but it is also plausible that the observed pulsar beam is evolving so rapidly that the visible beam precessed into view during the 1990s .",
    "clearly , careful monitoring of this pulsar s profile is in order .",
    "the tremendous success to date of pulsars in testing different aspects of gravitational theory leads naturally to the question of what can be expected in the future .",
    "improvements to the equivalence - principle violation tests will come from both refining the timing parameters of known pulsars ( in particular , limits on eccentricities and orbital period derivatives ) and the discovery of further pulsar  white - dwarf systems . potentially coalescing pulsar",
    " white - dwarf binaries , such as psrs  j1141@xmath1446545 , j0751 + 1807 @xcite and 1757@xmath1445322 @xcite , bear watching from the point of view of limits on dipolar gravitational radiation .",
    "another worthy , though difficult , goal is to attempt to derive the full orbital geometry for ultra - low - eccentricity systems , as has been done for psr  j0437@xmath1444715 @xcite ; this would quickly lead to significant improvements in the eccentricity - dependent tests .",
    "the orbital - period - derivative measurements of double - neutron - star binaries are already limited more by systematics ( galactic acceleration models for psr  b1913 + 16 , poorly known distance for psr  b1534 + 12 ) than by pulsar timing precision . however , with improved galactic modeling and a realistic expectation of an interferometric ( vlbi ) parallax for psr  b1534 + 12 , there is still hope for testing more carefully the prediction of quadrupolar gravitational radiation from these systems .",
    "the other timing parameters , equally important for tests of the quasi - static regime , can be expected to improve with time and better instrumentation , such as the wider - bandwidth coherent dedispersion systems now being installed at many observatories ( e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "especially exciting would be a measurement of the elusive shapiro delay in psr  b1913 + 16 ; the longitude of periastron is now precessing into an angular range where it may facilitate such a measurement @xcite .    in the last few years , surveys of the galactic plane and flanking regions , using the 64-m parkes telescope in australia @xcite , have discovered several hundred new pulsars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , including several new circular - orbit pulsar  white - dwarf systems @xcite and the eccentric pulsar  white - dwarf binary psr  j1141@xmath1446545 @xcite .",
    "a complete reprocessing of the galactic plane survey with improved interference filtering is in progress ; thus there is still hope that a truly new system such as a pulsar  black - hole binary may emerge from this large survey .",
    "several ongoing smaller surveys of small regions and globular clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) are also finding a number of new and exotic binaries , some of which may eventually turn out to be useful for tests of gr .",
    "the possible recent appearance of psr  j1141@xmath1446545 and the predicted disappearance of psr  b1913 + 16 due to geodetic precession make it worthwhile to periodically revisit previously surveyed parts of the sky in order to check for newly - visible exotic binaries . over the next several years",
    ", large - scale surveys are planned at arecibo @xcite and the new 100-m green bank telescope @xcite , offering the promise of over 1000 new pulsars including interesting binary systems .",
    "the sensitivity of these surveys will of course be dwarfed by the potential of the proposed square kilometre array radio telescope @xcite , which will be sensitive to pulsars clear through our galaxy and into neighbouring galaxies such as m31 . the next decade or two promise to be exciting times for pulsar searchers and for those looking to set ever - more - stringent limits on deviations from general relativity .",
    "the author holds an nserc university faculty award and is supported by a discovery grant .",
    "she thanks michael kramer , george hobbs and zaven arzoumanian for careful readings of the manuscript , duncan lorimer for generously sharing his keyworded reference list , and gilles esposito - farse , michael kramer , joe taylor , steve thorsett , willem van straten and joel weisberg for allowing reproduction of figures from their work .",
