    "<S> we present the results of global analyses of short - baseline neutrino oscillation data in 3 + 1 , 3 + 2 and 3 + 1 + 1 neutrino mixing schemes . </S>",

    "<S> we present the allowed region in the 3 + 1 parameter space , which is located at @xmath0 between @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xmath3 at @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the case of no oscillations is disfavored by about @xmath5 , which decreases dramatically to about @xmath6 if the lsnd data are not considered . </S>",
    "<S> hence , new high - precision experiments are needed to check the lsnd signal .    </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of short - baseline neutrino oscillations due to the existence of one or more sterile neutrinos at the ev scale is a hot topic in current neutrino physics ( see @xcite ) . besides the intrinsic interest in determining the existence of new phenomena and particles , the existence and properties of sterile neutrinos and active - sterile mixing could shed light on the physics beyond the standard model ( see @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of light sterile neutrinos is also very important for astrophysics ( see @xcite ) and cosmology ( see @xcite ) , and the recent first planck results @xcite have generated interesting studies on the implications of cosmological data for light sterile neutrinos @xcite .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we extend the analysis of short - baseline electron neutrino and antineutrino disappearance data presented in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite by taking into account also the more controversial indication of the lsnd @xcite experiment in favor of short - baseline @xmath7 transitions and the recent ambiguous results of the miniboone @xcite experiment . </S>",
    "<S> we consider 3 + 1 and 3 + 2 extensions of the standard model in which there are , respectively , one or two sterile neutrinos at the ev scale which generate short - baseline oscillations @xcite . in the 3 + 1 </S>",
    "<S> scheme electron and muon neutrino and antineutrino appearance and disappearance in short - baseline experiments depend on :    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> one neutrino squared - mass difference , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the mass of the massive neutrino @xmath10 and @xmath11 in order to accommodate the observed oscillations of solar , reactor , atmospheric and accelerator neutrinos in the standard framework of three - neutrino mixing ( see @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the probability of @xmath12 transitions has the two - neutrino - like form @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the mixing matrix , @xmath15 is the source - detector distance , and @xmath16 is the neutrino energy . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .   @xmath17 and @xmath18 , which determine the amplitude @xmath19 of @xmath20 transitions , the amplitude @xmath21 of @xmath22 disappearance , and the amplitude @xmath23 of @xmath24 disappearance .    </S>",
    "<S> since the oscillation probabilities of neutrinos and antineutrinos are related by a complex conjugation of the elements of the mixing matrix ( see @xcite ) , the probabilities of short - baseline @xmath25 and @xmath7 transitions are equal . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the 3 + 1 scheme can not explain a possible cp - violating difference of @xmath25 and @xmath7 transitions in short - baseline experiments . in order to allow this possibility </S>",
    "<S> , one must consider a 3 + 2 scheme , in which , there are four additional effective mixing parameters in short - baseline experiments :    1 .   </S>",

    "<S> since this complex phase appears with different signs in @xmath25 and @xmath7 transitions , it can generate measurable cp violations .        in the analysis of short - baseline data , we consider the following three groups of experiments :    1 .   the @xmath20 appearance data of the lsnd @xcite , miniboone @xcite , bnl - e776 @xcite , karmen @xcite , nomad @xcite , icarus @xcite and opera @xcite experiments . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .   the @xmath22 disappearance data described in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which take into account the reactor @xcite and gallium @xcite anomalies . </S>",
    "<S> 3 .   the constraints on @xmath24 disappearance obtained from the data of the cdhsw experiment @xcite , from the analysis @xcite of the data of atmospheric neutrino oscillation experiments , from the analysis @xcite of the minos neutral - current data @xcite and from the analysis of the sciboone - miniboone neutrino @xcite and antineutrino @xcite data .    with respect to the analysis presented in ref .  @xcite , we have added the new constraints on @xmath25 transitions obtained in the icarus @xcite and opera @xcite experiments . </S>",
    "<S> following ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we also added the constraints on @xmath25 and @xmath7 appearance obtained in the old bnl - e776 @xcite experiment , which give a small contribution at @xmath31 s larger than about @xmath32 , and the subleading effect of background disappearance in the analysis of miniboone @xcite data .    . </S>",
    "<S> [ tab:3p1 ] results of the fit of short - baseline data taking into account all miniboone data ( low ) , only the miniboone data above 475 mev ( hig ) , without miniboone data ( nomb ) and without lsnd data ( nolsnd ) . </S>",
    "<S> the results of the fit without neutrino oscillations are given in the first three lines , whereas the other lines refer to the 3 + 1 fit . </S>",
    "<S> we list the @xmath33 , the number of degrees of freedom ( ndf ) , the goodness - of - fit ( gof ) , the best - fit values of the 3 + 1 oscillation parameters and the quantities relevant for the appearance - disappearance ( app - dis ) parameter goodness - of - fit ( pg ) @xcite . in the last three lines we give the p - value ( @xmath34 ) and </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding number of excluding @xmath35 s ( @xmath36 ) of the no - oscillation case . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     let us consider now the fit of short - baseline data in the framework of 3 + 2 mixing , which was considered to be interesting in 2010 when the miniboone neutrino @xcite and antineutrino @xcite data showed a cp - violating tension . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , this tension reduced considerably in the final miniboone data @xcite and from tab .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tab:3p2 ] one can see that there is little improvement of the 3 + 2 fit with respect to the 3 + 1 case , in spite of the four additional parameters and the additional possibility of cp violation . </S>",
    "<S> first , from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mb ] one can see that the 3 + 2-low fit is as bad as the 3 + 1-low fit in fitting the three anomalous miniboone low - energy bins . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , comparing tabs .  [ tab:3p1 ] and [ tab:3p2 ] </S>",
    "<S> one can see that the appearance - disappearance tension in the 3 + 2-low fit is even worse than that in the 3 + 1-low fit , since the @xmath37 is so much larger that it can not be compensated by the additional degrees of freedom ( this behavior has been explained in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . hence , as in the 3 + 1 case it is wise to neglect the three low - energy miniboone anomalous bins and consider as more reliable the 3 + 2-hig fit , which has an acceptable appearance - disappearance parameter goodness - of - fit . </S>",
    "<S> however , one must ask if considering the larger complexity of the 3 + 2 scheme is justified by the data . </S>",
    "<S> the answer is negative because , as one can see from tab .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tab:3p2 ] , the value of the p - value obtained by restricting the 3 + 2 scheme to 3 + 1 disfavors the 3 + 1 scheme only at @xmath38 in the 3 + 2-hig fit .    </S>",
    "<S> a puzzling feature of the 3 + 2 scheme is that it needs the existence of two sterile neutrinos with masses at the ev scale . </S>",
    "<S> we think that it may be considered as more plausible that sterile neutrinos have a hierarchy of masses . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we considered also the 3 + 1 + 1 scheme @xcite in which @xmath39 is much heavier than 1 ev and the oscillations due to @xmath26 are averaged . </S>",
    "<S> hence , in the analysis of short - baseline data the 3 + 1 + 1 scheme has one effective parameter less than the 3 + 2 scheme . </S>",
    "<S> the results of the 3 + 1 + 1-low and 3 + 1 + 1-hig fits presented in tab .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tab:3p2 ] show that the 3 + 1 + 1-low is as bad as the 3 + 1-low and 3 + 2-low fits ( see also the bad fit of the three low - energy miniboone anomalous bins in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mb ] ) . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the 3 + 1 + 1-hig appearance - disappearance parameter goodness - of - fit is remarkably good , with a @xmath37 that is smaller than those in the 3 + 1-hig and 3 + 2-hig fits . </S>",
    "<S> however , the @xmath40 in the 3 + 1 + 1-hig is only slightly smaller than that in the 3 + 1-hig fit and the high p - value of the 3 + 1 scheme does not allow us to prefer the more complex 3 + 1 + 1 .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have presented the results of the global analysis of all the available data of short - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments in the framework of 3 + 1 , 3 + 2 and 3 + 1 + 1 neutrino mixing schemes . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the data do not allow us to reject the simplest 3 + 1 scheme in favor of the more complex 3 + 2 and 3 + 1 + 1 schemes . </S>",
    "<S> we have also shown that the low - energy miniboone anomaly can not be explained by neutrino oscillations in any of these schemes . considering the preferred 3 + 1 scheme </S>",
    "<S> , we have updated the constraints on the oscillation parameters and we have shown that there is only one allowed region in the parameter space around @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> we have also shown that the crucial indication in favor of short - baseline @xmath7 appearance is still given by the old lsnd data and the miniboone experiment has been inconclusive . hence new </S>",
    "<S> better experiments are needed in order to check this signal @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> let us finally emphasize that , besides the direct observation of short - baseline @xmath20 transitions , it is crucial to observe also short - baseline @xmath22 and @xmath24 disappearance . since the reactor and gallium anomalies indicate that @xmath22 indeed disappear , it is important to search also for the disappearance of @xmath24 @xcite . </S>"
