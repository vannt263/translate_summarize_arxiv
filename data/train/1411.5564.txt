    "it is generally thought that the carbon - silicate cycle acts as a stabilizing feedback and a powerful thermostat for the earth climate , guaranteeing surface liquid water conditions . above freezing temperatures",
    ", rock weathering occurs faster at higher temperatures , which reduces the @xmath0 atmospheric partial pressure , @xmath1 , and cools down the climate .",
    "conversely , on a frozen planet that temporarily lacks weathering , atmospheric @xmath0 builds up from continued volcanic outgassing , which warms up the climate until surface liquid water and weathering conditions are restored @xcite .",
    "such @xmath1 build up is in fact the leading scenario for the deglaciation of earth following a snowball event @xcite .",
    "generalizations of these concepts to earth - like planets around other stars are central to the definition of their liquid water habitable zone @xcite .",
    "in particular , planets subject to modest levels of insolation are expected to achieve temperate conditions with liquid water at the surface by building up massive enough @xmath0 atmospheres @xcite .",
    "experimental data , theoretical arguments and paleoclimate modeling suggest that the rate of @xmath0 intake via rock weathering by a planet lacking land vascular plants increases with the atmospheric @xmath0 content , @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this feature of lifeless planets or planets with only primitive forms of life is important because it will limit the buildup of @xmath0 at high values . as a result",
    ", the climate thermostat due to the carbon - silicate cycle should become less efficient on weakly - insolated earth - like planets located in the outer regions of the habitable zone .",
    "to address this issue quantitatively , we model earth - like climates with a zero - dimensional , energy balance model that equates the net insolation and thermal radiation fluxes , @xmath2= olr(t_{\\rm surf},pco_2),\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the insolation flux , @xmath4 is the planetary bond albedo and @xmath5 is the outgoing longwave radiation flux emitted by the planet . @xmath5 and @xmath4 are functions of the surface temperature , @xmath6 , and @xmath1 , derived from radiative - convective climate models @xcite ( see appendix  a for details ) .    while we assume that the climate reaches thermal equilibrium rapidly , by virtue of equation  ( 1 ) , the slower co@xmath7 compositional equilibrium is not imposed a priori in our models .",
    "rather , @xmath1 is evolved on the relevant geological timescales according to @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the global @xmath0 volcanic outgassing rate ( estimated as @xmath10  bars / gyr for earth @xcite ) and @xmath11 is the rate of @xmath0 intake by the solid planet via rock weathering . the functional form of @xmath11 is adapted from earth studies for pre - vascular plant conditions @xcite : @xmath12 } \\times \\left [ 1 +    k_{\\rm run } ( t_{\\rm surf } -288)\\right]^{0.65},\\ ] ] where @xmath13bar is the pre - industrial @xmath1 level , @xmath14 for @xmath15k , @xmath16 is related to an activation energy and @xmath17 is a runoff efficiency factor .",
    "varying @xcite @xmath18 in the range @xmath19@xmath20 and @xmath21 in the range @xmath22@xmath23 has only a minor quantitative impact on our results .",
    "values of @xmath24@xmath25 have been considered in the literature @xcite for the dependence of weathering on @xmath1 in the absence of land vascular plants .",
    "we use @xmath26 ( default ) and @xmath27 in this work . note that equations  ( 1 ) and  ( 2 ) are coupled through @xmath28 and @xmath6 .",
    "steady - state climate solutions , satisfying both radiative ( equation  ( 1 ) ) and weathering equilibrium ( @xmath29 in equation  ( 2 ) ) are represented in figure  1 by intersecting cooling and heating curves .",
    "solid red lines in figure  1 show the albedo - corrected insolation flux ( lhs of equation  ( 1 ) ) received by a planet located at 1 , 1.25 and 1.6 au from a sun - like star as a function of surface temperature . in equation ( 1 )",
    "depends on @xmath1 , we find that this dependence is quantitatively negligible for @xmath30  bar . for simplicity",
    ", we plot heating ( red ) curves in this low @xmath1 limit in figure  1 , which is indeed satisfied by all the cooling ( blue ) curves shown .",
    "all our other results fully account for the @xmath4@xmath1 dependence . ]",
    "net insolation drops precipitously from 273k to 263k as the planetary surface freezes and the albedo reaches @xmath31 .",
    "the various blue lines in figure  1 represent the @xmath5 cooling flux ( rhs of equation  ( 1 ) ) according to various scenarios for the atmospheric @xmath0 content .    a standard model with @xmath1 arbitrarily fixed at @xmath32bar ( i.e. not constrained by equation  ( 2 ) )",
    "is represented by the slanted solid blue line . as is well known @xcite , three steady - state climate solutions exist in such a model for an earth - like planet at 1au , as indicated by diamonds where the red and blue curves intersect .",
    "earth s current climate ( @xmath33  k ) and a globally - frozen state ( @xmath34  k ) are both stable , while the intermediate state ( @xmath35  k ) is thermally unstable .",
    "however , when @xmath1 is also required to satisfy weathering equilibrium ( equation  ( 2 ) ) , steady - state climate+weathering solutions only exist above freezing temperatures since weathering stops operating on a frozen planet . a model including weathering without any @xmath1 dependence@xcite ( @xmath36 in equation  ( 3 ) ) is represented by the vertical solid blue line in figure  1 . in such a model ,",
    "weathering equilibrium enforces a unique surface temperature , set by requiring that weathering balances volcanic outgassing in equation  ( 2 ) , and @xmath1 is only indirectly constrained by the constant @xmath6 requirement .    on the other hand ,",
    "when the weathering rate depends on both @xmath1 and @xmath6 , noticeable bends appear in the blue cooling curves shown in figure  1 .",
    "indeed , in this class of models , the reduced efficiency of weathering at low temperatures must be balanced by large @xmath1 values to match the volcanic outgassing rate @xmath9",
    ". the weaker the weathering @xmath1 dependence , the stronger is the @xmath1 build - up at low surface temperatures ( compare @xmath26 and @xmath27 models represented by the dashed and dash - dotted lines in figure  1 , respectively ) .",
    "a planet with a larger volcanic @xmath0 outgassing rate @xcite achieves a warmer stable climate ( @xmath37  k for @xmath38 and adopting our default weathering parameters , which is the case shown as a dotted line in figure  1 ) .",
    "interestingly , stable climate+weathering solutions can cease to exist at low insolation levels , such as the 1.25 and 1.6 au cases shown in figure  1 , for a strong enough dependence of the weathering rate on @xmath1 .",
    "for example , we find that blue curves no longer intersect with heating ( insolation ) lines beyond 1.077 au if @xmath39 and beyond 1.25 au if @xmath40 .",
    "conversely , a very weak weathering dependence on @xmath1 ( @xmath41 ) , including the singular case @xmath36 ( vertical solid blue line in figure  1 ) , do permit stable climate+weathering solutions at almost arbitrarily low insolation levels @xcite .",
    "low @xmath42 values may be the relevant limit for planets where land vascular plants are widespread @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , for values of @xmath43@xmath44 appropriate for planets lacking land vascular plants @xcite , the bending of cooling curves seen in figure  1 also implies that at fixed volcanism rate , @xmath9 , less insolated planets achieve climate+weathering equilibrium at gradually lower @xmath6 values .",
    "for example ,",
    "in the case @xmath45 , equilibrium is only marginally achieved above freezing temperatures at 1.25 au , as shown in figure  1 . at low enough insolation levels ( far enough away from the star ) ,",
    "climate+weathering equilibrium is no longer possible above freezing temperatures , which implies that weathering equilibrium is unattainable .    on planets lacking weathering equilibrium",
    ", the climate must repeatedly cycle through a succession of radiative equilibria as illustrated in figure  1 : rapid transition from marginal to full glaciation ( a@xmath46b , at fixed @xmath1 ) , slow build - up of @xmath1 caused by volcanic outgassing in the absence of weathering ( b@xmath46c ) , rapid transition to a deglaciated state ( c@xmath46d , at fixed @xmath1 ) and gradual @xmath1 decay under the action of weathering ( d@xmath46a ) , until the cycle repeats again with full glaciation .",
    "the general properties of the four critical points a - b - c - d of this climate cycle , which are independent of details of the weathering model , are quantified in figure  2 as a function of orbital distance from a sun - like star .",
    "blue curves correspond to the coldest cycle point with the lowest @xmath1 value , b , while the red curves correspond to the hottest point with the highest @xmath1 value , d.    figure  2 shows that earth - like planets at larger orbital distances glaciate and deglaciate at larger @xmath1 values .",
    "a deglaciation with @xmath47  bar at @xmath25  au is consistent with values reported for snowball earth deglaciation @xcite .",
    "planets beyond @xmath48  au support massive ( @xmath49  bar ) @xmath0 atmospheres throughout their climate cycle .",
    "planets in the frozen state have albedos @xmath50 , while the albedo of unfrozen planets rises from @xmath51 to @xmath52 in the range @xmath25-@xmath53  au , from an increasing atmospheric scattering contribution .",
    "the extremes of surface temperature along the cycle vary modestly with insolation level , with @xmath54-@xmath55  k at the coldest point and @xmath56-@xmath57  k at the hottest point .",
    "explicit time - dependent integrations of the system of equations  ( 1)-(3 ) reveal details of the climate cycle illustrated in figure  1 .",
    "we initiated these integrations at the hot , high @xmath1 ( weathering - independent ) point d and confirmed that earth - like planets receiving sufficiently large insolation fluxes settle to a steady - state warm climate solution after relaxation to weathering equilibrium .",
    "by contrast , planets at large enough orbital distances ( low enough insolation levels ) experience large amplitude climate cycles , as anticipated from our discussion of equilibrium solutions in relation to figure  1 .",
    "figure  3 shows six illustrative examples ( a - f ) of such climate cycles , shown in terms of variable @xmath6 and @xmath1 curves .",
    "most of the cycle time is spent in the frozen state , during which @xmath1 build - up is slow compared to the fast weathering that occurs at above - freezing temperatures . in model 1 , 4.6% of the 70 myr cycle is spent in a warm state with surface liquid water .",
    "the corresponding numbers are 0.8% of 477 myr in model 2 , 7.5% of 76 myr in model 3 , 3.9% of 139 myr in model 4 , 28% of 312 myr in model 5 and 17% of 517 myr in model 6 .",
    "faster weathering at higher @xmath6 also implies that most of the time in the unfrozen state is spent just above freezing temperatures , near the lowest @xmath1 levels covered during the cycle . for a fixed volcanic outgassing rate , @xmath9 ,",
    "the climate cycle duration increases with decreasing insolation because larger absolute @xmath1 values must be reached for climate transitions to occur ( figure  2 ) .",
    "decreasing insolation also reduces the fraction of cycle time spent with surface liquid water by the planet , although this can be compensated for by stronger volcanic outgassing .",
    "a weaker @xmath1 weathering dependence ( lower @xmath42 ) lengthens the duration of the unfrozen state since the decline in @xmath1 with time has less of an effect on the weathering rate .    to summarize , a temperature - only dependence of the weathering rate ( @xmath36 ) uniquely ties the surface temperature to the volcanic outgassing rate @xmath9 via equation  ( 2 ) .",
    "a more general dependence on @xmath1 ( @xmath58 ) leads to a richer set of climate solutions , including unstable climate cycles at low enough insolation levels , when weathering equilibrium ceases to exist .",
    "these results are not specific to the weathering functional form adopted in equation  ( 3 ) , in the sense that other weathering laws with a positive dependence on @xmath1 and @xmath6 would lead to qualitatively similar climate behaviors .",
    "the key new feature of our analysis is the lack of stable climates on earth - like planets lacking land vascular plants , at low enough insolation levels .",
    "this suggests that a subset of earth - like planets located in the outer regions of habitable zones may be preferentially found in a frozen , rather than deglaciated , state .",
    "a globally frozen state might be observationally inferred from the very high albedo and the correspondingly low water content of the planet s atmosphere . according to these results , some earth - like planets in the outer habitable zone",
    "would also be caught in a transiently warm state with surface liquid water present only infrequently .",
    "the link between unstable climate cycles and the emergence and evolution of life on weakly - insolated earth - like planets is unclear but possibly important .",
    "a reduced amount of time with surface liquid water on planets experiencing climate cycles could in principle slow down the emergence and/or evolution of life . on the other hand , life itself",
    "could strongly impact the weathering process on weakly - insolated earth - like planets , as it seems to have done on early earth @xcite .",
    "in particular , the ability of land vascular plants to regulate the soil @xmath1 level that is relevant to the weathering process , well above atmospheric @xmath1 levels , is consistent with these plants effectively decoupling the weathering rate from the atmospheric @xmath1 level @xcite , leading to @xmath59 in equation  ( 3 ) . as a result ( figure  1 , vertical line )",
    ", the climate of weakly - insolated earth - like planets could be stabilized against transient cycles once the presence of land vascular plants becomes widespread .",
    "this would constitute a strong example of life exerting a feedback on its environment .",
    "it is worth noting that earth s geological record is qualitatively consistent with the evolutionary path one may envision for a habitable planet orbiting a star that is gradually brightening over time .",
    "repeated snowball events should be restricted to early times , when insolation is weak and land vascular plants are absent .",
    "they should disappear at late times once insolation is strong enough and/or land vascular plants become widespread .",

    "in addition to the simplified , zero - dimensional treatment of climate described above , which suggests the possibility of richer behaviors in higher complexity , three - dimensional climate models , our treatment of weathering processes is intentionally simple , in order to isolate they key factors that determine climate stability .",

    "the absolute calibration of weathering rates in the absence of land vascular plants is unknown , but it is thought to be less than in their presence @xcite . for concreteness , we have chosen to calibrate weathering fluxes in our models using current earth @xcite ( equation  ( 3 ) ) .",
    "we note that in a model admitting steady - state solutions , a factor three decrease in the weathering rate is equivalent to a factor three increase in the volcanic outgassing rate ( see equation  ( 2 ) ) , which is one of the cases shown in figure  1 ( dotted blue line ) .",
    "such a model retains the main qualitative feature highlighted in this work , which is the disappearance of stable climates solutions at low enough insolation levels ( beyond @xmath67au for the dotted blue line shown in figure  1 ) .",
    "different calibrations in weathering rates and/or volcanic outgassing rates will thus affect our results quantitatively , but our main conclusions should remain valid .    more generally , a planet is likely to change its weathering regime gradually over time , as different forms of life emerge and spread over its surface @xcite .",
