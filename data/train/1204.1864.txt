    "in the last decade , the analysis and interpretation of observational data are strongly indicating that the present universe is accelerating and that its geometry is spatially flat @xcite .",
    "these observations gave rise to a resurgence of interest in a non - zero cosmological constant @xmath0 that dominates the current composition of the universe @xcite .",
    "the main motivation behind this idea is that a very small value for @xmath0 ( @xmath1 of the cosmic composition ) , not only would explain the observed late - time acceleration of the universe ( as indicated by type ia supernovae observations but would also reconcile the inflationary flatness prediction , corroborated by cosmic microwave background data , ( @xmath2 ) with the current clustering estimates that point systematically to @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "although flat models with a very small cosmological term are in good agreement with almost all sets of observational data , the value of @xmath4 inferred from observations ( @xmath5 ) is between 50 - 120 orders of magnitude below estimates given by quantum field theory ( @xmath6 @xmath7 ) .",
    "this extreme discrepancy originates an extreme fine - tuning problem , the so - called cosmological constant problem , and requires a complete cancellation from an unknown physical mechanism @xcite .",
    "another problem with the cosmological term is that , although a very small ( but non - zero ) value for @xmath0 could conceivably be explained by some unknown physical symmetry being broken by a small amount , one should be able to explain not only why it is so small but also why it is exactly the right value that is just beginning to dominate the energy density of the universe now . since both components ( dark matter and cosmological term ) are usually assumed to be independent and , therefore , scale in different ways , this would require an unbelievable co - occurrence , usually referred to as the coincidence problem ( cp ) .",
    "many phenomenological models with variable cosmological term ( decaying vacuum ) have been proposed in literature as an attempt to alleviate the cosmological constant problem @xcite and more recently the coincidence problem @xcite . in the context of the general relativity theory a cosmological term that varies in space or time",
    "requires a coupling with some other cosmic component , so that the total energy - momentum tensor is conserved .",
    "thus , @xmath8 models provide either a process of a particle production or a time - varying mass of the dark matter particles increases @xcite .    in this paper , we focus our attention on the theoretical and observational aspects of a @xmath9cdm model in which the cosmological term evolves as a truncated power series of the hubble parameter .",
    "the decaying vacuum component is assumed to be coupled only with the dark matter ( interacting dark sector ) thereby producing dark matter particles . the work is structured as follows . in section",
    "ii , we discuss the general aspects and solve the basic equations of the decaying vacuum model . the observational constraints on parameters of the model",
    "are discussed in section iii . in section iv , by following an approach proposed by maia and lima @xcite , we also derive a coupled scalar field version for this vacuum decay scenario . finally , the basic results are summarized in the conclusion section v.",
    "let us first consider a homogeneous , isotropic and spatially flat universe described by the friedmann - robertson - walker line element .",
    "in such a background , the einstein field equations are given by @xmath10 and @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are , respectively , the energy density and pressure of the cosmic fluid ( radiation , baryons and dark matter ) and the dot denotes the derivative with respect to time .",
    "in this paper , we will work with the @xmath9 function written as a power series of the hubble parameter up to the second order , i.e. , @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are constants with dimensions of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively , while @xmath19 is a dimensionless constant .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath17 was proposed long ago by carvalho , lima and waga @xcite based on dimensional arguments .",
    "later on , it was also justified by using techniques from the renormalization group approach @xcite .",
    "the linear term was first discussed by carneiro and collaborators @xcite .",
    "the interest in the extended model represented by the above truncated power series was also suggested in the appendix c of a paper by basilakos , plionis and sol @xcite . as remarked",
    "before , here we discuss the observational potentialities of this model , and , for completeness , we also derive the associated scalar field description .",
    "now by combining the above equations and considering that @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the adiabatic index , we find @xmath22 the integration of above equation leads the following @xmath18 parameter @xmath23\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the cosmic scale factor . in",
    "what follows , we will restrict our analysis to case in which @xmath26 .",
    "the practical reason for this choice is that the linear term in eq .",
    "( [ evo ] ) causes a transition decelerating / accelerating phase .",
