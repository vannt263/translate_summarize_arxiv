    "a basic calculation ( @xcite proposition 4.70 ) shows that @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the exterior derivative acting on the ricci tensor treated as a one - form with values in the cotangent bundle , and @xmath8 is the adjoint of @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , @xmath9 for purposes of this paper , we say that a metric is _ critical _ if @xmath10 for some @xmath11 . in general gradient flows of riemannian functionals",

    "following the prior discussion , we may define the one - parameter family of diffeomorphisms @xmath100 where here @xmath101 denotes the vector field dual to @xmath102 with respect to the metric @xmath60 . by the estimates for @xmath60 which we have shown",

    "this flow differs from ( [ conformalflow ] ) by a rescaling in space and a reparameterization of time , and these scales are determined by the volume of the solution to ( [ conformalflow ] ) , which is easily seen to grow at worst linearly . in particular , it is easy to see that the corresponding solution to ( [ vnflow2 ] ) exists for all time",
    ". furthermore , one can show using an argument akin to lemma [ surfaceslemma1 ] that @xmath111 dv .",
    "\\end{split}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    first we want to show subsequential convergence to a metric of constant curvature .",
    "consider now some sequence of times @xmath112 .",
    "the metrics @xmath113 have bounded calabi energy and unit volume . by theorem [ chen ] , we either have bubbling or smooth convergence . in the case of smooth convergence ,",
    "the limiting metric is necessarily extremal hermitian by ( [ vngradient ] ) , and hence constant curvature .",
    "this was first observed by calabi @xcite , and can be seen by pairing the critical equation equation against @xmath114 and integrating by parts .",
    "so , let us assume that the sequence bubbles in the sense of theorem [ chen ] .",
    "at this point we break into two cases .",
    "first assume @xmath115 .",
    "by theorem [ chen ] , either one gets a well - defined limit metric @xmath95 on @xmath116 or the sequence experiences collapse and the volume of @xmath117 is zero in the limit .",
    "first we rule out the collapsing possibility . in the terminology of @xcite , if this occurs then @xmath117 is a `` ghost vertex '' in the tree decomposition of the limit of @xmath118 .",
    "every vertex which is not a ghost vertex ( and one must exist since the area is fixed ) corresponds to a finite - area metric which is critical by ( [ vngradient ] ) .",
    "this is necessarily the rotationally symmetric `` teardrop metric '' of chen ( @xcite section 8) .",
    "one can show that this metric still has strictly positive curvature integral , in particular , the contribution to the euler characteristic of the limiting tree is positive .",
    "it follows that the euler characteristic of @xmath117 must be strictly negative .",
    "we conclude that @xmath119 but the area approaches zero and the calabi energy remains finite , so this is a contradiction .",
    "therefore the collapse possiblity does not occur , and hence we conclude weak convergence to a critical bubbled metric .",
    "the schematic picture of the limit is in figure [ fig : figure1 ] .",
    "it remains to compute the energy of this metric to derive a contradiction .",
    "since there exists at least one bubble point , the euler characteristic of @xmath117 is strictly negative .",
    "specifically , @xmath120 since @xmath95 is an extremal metric on a surface of negative euler characteristic , it follows from ( @xcite theorem a ) that in fact @xmath121 .",
    "we conclude by the gauss - bonnet theorem that @xmath122 therefore since @xmath123 , we directly estimate @xmath124 ^ 2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the volume was fixed to be @xmath110 along the flow , we have by hypothesis that the initial energy is below @xmath125 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "certainly then the limit should have energy below this value as well , contradicting the above .",
    "thus this bubbling possiblity does not occur and the flow converges to a constant scalar curvature metric , as claimed .",
    "now we address the case of the sphere .",
    "first let us rule out the collapsing case . by following the proof in the negative euler characteristic case",
    "we see that the only case which is not immediately ruled out is when the euler characteristic of @xmath117 ( using the notation above ) is zero , which can theoretically happen in the case of two bubbling points .",
    "the simplest example of this behavior is shown in figure [ fig : figure2 ] .    in this case",
    ", there must be at least two `` deepest bubbles '' @xmath126 which by the arguments above must correspond to teardrop metrics .",
    "one can explicitly compute the energy contained in a teardrop bubble in terms of its area .",
    "in particular ( see @xcite section 8) , one has @xmath127 since @xmath128 , one can use the inequality @xmath129 for @xmath130 to conclude that @xmath131 contradicting our low - energy hypothesis .",
    "therefore we must get a noncollapsed limit at infinity , and it remains to rule out bubbling in this case .",
    "we know that in this noncollapsed case that the limiting metric must be a critical metric with cusp ends",
    ". in particular , there must be at least three bubble points and the limiting metric has constant negative curvature .",
    "what is more , there are three deepest bubbles which must correspond to teardrop metrics , and hence precisely as above one obtains ( [ sphereenergy ] ) .",
    "in fact one gets an even better bound , but certainly at least we have proved that in the general case ( [ sphereenergy ] ) holds , contradicting our initial energy hypothesis .",
    "to finish the proof we need to exhibit exponential convergence , which we only sketch here since these details are the same as the case of calabi flow which appear in ( @xcite proposition 6.1 ) .",
    "the main estimate to show is exponential decay of the calabi energy . by the above arguments , any sequence of times",
    "@xmath132 must be bounded in @xmath86 , therefore there is a uniform bound for @xmath133 in @xmath86 which holds for all times . by the sobolev embedding",
    "we conclude a uniform @xmath87 bound for @xmath133 , and hence a uniform bound for the sobolev constants of the time - varying metrics .",
    "moreover , the calabi energy converges subsequentially to zero . at any large time",
    "where @xmath134 , using the sobolev constant estimate of the time - varying metrics , one can obtain the estimate @xmath135 in the case of nonpositive euler characteristic one immediately concludes exponential convergence . in the case of the sphere one has to exploit the kazdan - warner identity to show that @xmath136 is nearly orthogonal to the first eigenspace of @xmath137 , after which exponential convergence follows . with this exponential decay in place",
    "we can get exponential convergence in stronger norms .",
    "first , since we know the sobolev constant is uniformly bounded for all time , by repeating the blowup argument of theorem [ surfaces ] we obtain a uniform curvature bound .",
    "now we can apply ( @xcite theorem 5.4 ) to conclude that all @xmath138 norms of curvature decay exponentially as well . with the exponential convergence in hand ,",
    "standard calculations show that once we pull back the conformal flow to give a solution of ( [ flow ] ) , we still have exponential convergence , and the result follows .",
    "naturally , one expects that the flow should converge to a constant scalar curvature metric with arbitrary initial data .",
    "the reason one can obtain this for calabi flow is that one has monotone quantities which are constant only at constant scalar curvature metrics .",
    "indeed , the existence of such a quantity for ( [ flow ] ) would immediately imply convergence with arbitrary initial data , via arguments that appear in ( @xcite ) ."
