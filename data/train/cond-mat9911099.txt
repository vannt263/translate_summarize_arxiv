    "a somewhat related approach was also employed by sarker@xcite using the slave - fermion approach to the @xmath0 model@xcite , where he proposed that d - wave superconductivity arises in the hole - driven quantum disordered phase of antiferromagnets as a result of formation of spin resonant - valence - bonds ( rvb ) and spin - charge recombination .",
    "another completely different approach was proposed by zhang _",
    "et.al._@xcite where they proposed that antiferromagnetism and d - wave superconductivity are related by an hidden so(5 ) symmetry in the system@xcite .",
    "all these proposals have met criticisms of one form or other and there is no universally accepted theory at present .    in this paper",
    "we shall propose a duality relation between antiferromagnetism and d - wave superconductivity in the @xmath0 model .",
    "in existing treatments of @xmath0 model , antiferromagnetism and ( d - wave ) superconductivity appear separately in very different ways of treating the problem .",
    "the antiferromagnetic ( or spiral ) state is best described by the slave - fermion mean - field theory ( sfmft)@xcite where the spins are represented by bosons and holes by fermions , whereas d - wave superconductivity is described by the slave - boson mean - field theory ( sbmft)@xcite where spins are represented by fermions and holes by bosons .",

    "we shall call the topological spin and charge excitations spinons and holons , respectively to distinguish them from corresponding elementary excitations in mean - field theories .",

    "the effect of bose condensation will be addressed at the end of the section .    to look for topological excitations in sfmft ,",
    "we notice that the structure of the mean - field theory resembles very much the bcs theory for superconductivity , except that spin - pairs of bosons replace the electron ( fermion ) cooper pairs in bcs theory .",
    "the resemblance of the two theories leads us to study _ vortex _ excitations in sfmft , since vortices are stable topological excitations in bcs theory at two dimensions .",
    "in bcs theory , a vortex located at @xmath27 is a solution of the bcs mean - field equation , where the order parameter @xmath28 has a form @xmath29 in a polar coordinate , where @xmath30 is real and positive . to minimize energy , a magnetix flux of @xmath31-flux quanta",

    "the relative phases between the spin singlets are fixed by the marshall sign rule , and the total wavefunction represents a bose - condensate of spin singlet pairs , just like a bcs superconducting state can be viewed as a bose - condensed state of cooper pairs .",
    "the coherent phase structure of the ground state wavefunction allows us to construct topological excitations ( vortices ) in this condensate where the phases of the spin singlets change by @xmath37 when going around the center of a vortex@xcite .",
    "notice that although sfmft does not enforce the requirement of no double occupancy in the @xmath0 model rigorously , the correct phase structure of the wavefunction ( marshall sign rule ) is kept .",
    "therefore we expect that the qualitative properties of vortex excitations are correct in sfmft . in the spiral",
    "states the consideration is similar , except that the two spins in a spin - singlet pair may occupy the _ same _ sublattice in the spiral states@xcite and the phases are not given by marshall sign rule but are nevertheless fixed@xcite .",

    "the location of dispersion minimum for spinons in sbmft can not be determined with certainty without further understanding of their microscopic dynamics . nevertheless , if we assume that the dispersion minimum is located at the same @xmath230-point as spinwaves in sfmft , then the only difference between spinons in sbmft and spinwaves in sfmft is that there is a finite energy gap in the spinon spectrum at @xmath168 .",
    "similar correspondence also exists between holons in sbmft and elementary hole excitations in sfmft . in the spiral states of sfmft the holes form fermi sea pockets around @xmath231@xcite in our choosen gauge , which can be interpreted phenomenologically as two dirac fermion pockets centered at the same momenta points and with finite chemical potential @xmath232 such that particle - hole symmetry is broken and there exists nonzero density of ( fermionic ) holes in the ground state .",
    "the interpretation is valid at low energy @xmath233 . on the other hand , @xmath234 for holons in sbmft , implying that the ground state holon density is zero and there exists a nonzero energy gap for holon excitations in sbmft .",
    "in the previous two sections we demonstrate that topological spin and charge excitations exist as well defined excitations in the disordered phases @xmath26 , @xmath199 of slave - fermion and slave - boson mean - field theories of the @xmath0 model , respectively . moreover ,",
    "the topological spin and charge excitations in one mean - field ground state behave as `` gapped '' elementary excitations of the other mean - field state . in this section",
    "we shall explore this relation further by showing that a consistent phase diagram of the @xmath0 model can be obtained if we assume that the ground state in one mean - field theory is a quantum - disordered state of the other mean - field theory .",
    "the disordering effect is coming from `` condensation '' of topological excitations .",
    "we shall divide our discussions in two parts . in part",
    "i we shall study the effective actions of the topological excitations in the two mean - field theories and argue that quantum phase transitions to disordered states are natural outcomes of the effective actions when concentration of hole @xmath38 changes . based on this result and the requirement that the phase diagram derived from the quantum - disordering picture of sfmft and sbmft must be consistent with each other we shall construct in part ii a plausible phase diagram of @xmath0 model .",
    "first we consider the case of sfmft . to show that quantum - disordered state of topological excitations is a natural outcome of our theory we start with the phase action  ( [ glgauge ] ) which describes the ( uniform ) phase fluctuations of the order parameter @xmath14 in sfmft .",
    "a quantum - disordered phase is found if the phase @xmath98 is disordered in the ground state .",
    "the action  ( [ spsf ] ) is in fact a 3d @xmath235 model ( coupled to gauge field ) and is known to go through a transition to a disordered phase when the coupling constant @xmath236 is less than certain critical value @xmath237@xcite .",
    "the mass gap of vortices go to zero as the system approaches the transition point from the ordered phase@xcite , showing that the quantum phase transition is driven by condensation of vortex loops .",
    "( notice that we assume here that the gauge field @xmath34 is not in the confining phase@xcite ) .",
    "it is easy to see from eq .",
    "( [ xis ] ) that @xmath238 is a decreasing function of @xmath38 in sfmft , as least for small @xmath38 .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to assume that there exists a critical value of hole concentration @xmath239 at which the ground state described by sfmft goes through a quantum phase transition to a disordered phase when @xmath240 .",
    "the main difference between the quantum - disordered state in sfmft and usual 3d @xmath235 model is that we assume a bound state of spin or hole exists in the vortex core in sfmft .",
    "thus there exists two kinds of vortices ( spinons and holons ) in sfmft which possess different statistics and dynamics .",
    "in particular , since we assume spin - charge separation and the mass gap for holons @xmath241 should be smaller than the mass gap for spinons @xmath242 in general , the condensation of ( bosonic ) holons and ( fermionic ) spinons should occur at two different critical hole concentrations @xmath243 and @xmath244 , respectively with @xmath245 .",
    "therefore two different quantum - disordered states corresponding to condensation of holons and holons @xmath246 spinons are expected to exist in our theory .",
    "unfortunately we can not deduce the properties of the quantum - disordered states unambigously based on our simple phenomenological treatment of spinon and holon dynamics . in particular , the nature of the quantum - disordered state coming from condensation of _ fermionic _ vortex loops has never been investigated theoretically .",
    "the nature of the quantum disordered states will be deduced phenomenologically in the next subsection .",
    "another special feature of sfmft which is absent in usual 3d @xmath235 model is the presence of long - ranged spiral magnetic order @xmath24 at zero temperature , at least when hole concentration is small .",
    "we shall assume that the long - ranged order exists at small value of @xmath38 and vanishes ( @xmath247 ) at exactly @xmath244 , for reasons we shall see in the following . to summarize we show in fig.2a schematically the expected behavior of @xmath241 , @xmath242 and @xmath248 as functions of @xmath38 in sfmft .",
    "next we consider the case of sbmft .",
    "we start with the phase action  ( [ sbss ] ) describing the phase dynamics of the d - wave spin - pairing order parameter @xmath14 in sbmft .",
    "the phase action  ( [ sbss ] ) is also a 3d @xmath235 model as in the case of sfmft and the system is expected to go through a transition to a disordered phase when the coupling constant @xmath249 is less than certain critical value @xmath237 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath250 is an increasing function of @xmath38 in sbmft , at least for small @xmath38 and goes to zero as @xmath251 .",
    "therefore , it seems reasonable to assume that there exists a critical value of hole concentration @xmath239 below which the system is in a quantum - disordered phase of sbmft .    as in sfmft ,",
    "the main difference between the quantum - disordered state of sbmft and usual 3d @xmath235 model ( in the context of a d - wave superconductor@xcite ) is that we assume bound state of spin or hole exists in the vortex core and there are two kinds of vortices ( spinons and holons ) in sbmft . unlike sfmft",
    ", we expect that the mass gap for holons @xmath252 is _ larger _ than mass gap for spinons @xmath253 in sbmft and therefore , the condensation of ( fermionic ) holons and ( bosonic ) spinons should occur at different critical hole concentrations @xmath254 and @xmath255 , respectively with @xmath256 .",
    "notice that we are not able to deduce the properties of the quantum - disordered states of sbmft with certainty as in the case of sfmft .",
    "note that because of spin - charge seperation , the holes in sbmft may exist in a quantum disordered ( insulator ) phase with @xmath199 by themselves , independent of the disordering effect on spin - pairing order parameter @xmath14@xcite . in particular , it is expected that a zero temperature disordered phase of bosonic holes can be formed at small enough @xmath257 because of disordering effect associated with ( @xmath37 flux ) vortex - loop condensation in the boson field@xcite .",
    "the different disordering effects in sbmft are summarized in fig.2b , where we show schematically the expected behaviours of mass gap @xmath252 , @xmath253 and hole - condensation amplitude @xmath258 as functions of @xmath38 .",
    "notice that we have assumed that @xmath259 in drawing the figure .",
    "we shall explain why we make this assumption in the following subsection .",
    "in this subsection we shall construct a phase - diagram of @xmath0 model , based on what we have obtained in previous sections .",
    "our main assumption is that the quantum - disordering effect associated with condensation of topological excitations in sfmft ( sbmft ) of @xmath0 model gives rise to the ground state described by sbmft ( sfmft ) , with the roles of topological excitations and elementary excitations being interchanged at the quantum - disordering transition .",
    "this assumption is consistent with the `` dual '' relations we obtained in sections ii and iii between the elementary excitations in one mean - field phase and topological excitations in the other .",
    "notice that this statement has to be understood with care because the quantum phase transitions associated with condensation of spinons and holons occur in general at different dopping concentration @xmath38s(see figure 2 ) .",
    "as a result there exists at least three different regions in the zero - temperature phase diagram of @xmath0 model in the duality picture .    for our assumption to be valid , the quantum - disordering transition of holons and spinons from sfmft to sbmft and from sbmft to sfmft must occur at consistent value of doping , i.e. we must have @xmath260 and @xmath261 .",
    "the zero - temperature phase diagram has therefore at least three different regions : ( i)@xmath262 , in this region the low energy physics is described by sfmft , fermionic spinons and bosonic holons are high - energy topological excitations , ( ii)@xmath263 , in this region we expect that both low energy spin and charge excitations are bosonic .",
    "the precise nature of this state will be discussed below , and ( iii)@xmath264 , in this region the low energy physics is described by sbmft , bosonic spinons and fermionic holons are high - energy topological excitations .",
    "next we consider the transition regions @xmath265 and @xmath266 more carefully .",
    "first we consider @xmath265 .",
    "the change in the hole spectrum around this region can be described phenomenologically by a band picture with two branches of hole spectrum .",
    "the first one is the dirac fermion spectrum  ( [ lsbh ] ) with dirac pockets centered at @xmath267 and the second one is the boson spectrum  ( [ leffh ] ) with dispersion minimum around @xmath163 . in the regime @xmath262 , we have @xmath268 such that at zero temperature , the dirac fermion pockets are occupied and the bosonic hole band is empty .",
    "the ground state of the system is described by sfmft . as @xmath269 , @xmath270 and",
    "the bosonic hole excitations become gapless . as @xmath38 increases ,",
    "@xmath271 and decreases further , until all the fermionic holes become bosonic and the dirac pocket becomes empty .",
    "notice that this band picture describes only the transformation of fermionic holes to bosonic ones at @xmath265 but the nature of the ground state of the bosonic hole system is not addressed .",
    "we shall argue below that the bosonic holes must exist in an insulating phase and @xmath272 is a critical point where the system undergoes a metal - insulator transition in the absence of potential disorder ( anderson localization ) .",
    "notice that this is consistent with the existence of a nonzero critical hole density @xmath273 below which the bosonic holes are in a quantum - disordered phase@xcite .",
    "next we consider the region @xmath266 . the transition can be described by a picture with two branches of spin excitations .",
    "the first one is the dirac fermion spectrum  ( [ lspinon ] ) and the second one is the spinwave like spectrum  ( [ lefsbs ] ) . in the regime @xmath274 , @xmath253 is zero whereas @xmath242 is finite , the presence of gapless spinwave excitation indicates that the system is magnetically ordered and the dirac fermions are high energy spin excitations",
    ". therefore we expect @xmath24 at @xmath275 , as we have assumed in previous subsection ( see fig.2a ) .",
    "the opposite is true for @xmath276 , where @xmath253 becomes nonzero and @xmath242 is zero . in this region",
    "the elementary spin excitations are described by gapless dirac fermion pockets .",
    "the spinwave excitations are gapped and the system has no long - ranged magnetic order .",
    "notice that the system may be in a spin - gap state or d - wave superconducting state , depending on whether @xmath258 is equal to zero@xcite .    to complete our discussion",
    "we shall now consider the regime @xmath263 and ask what is the ground state of the system at this regime .",
    "following our previous discussions this is a regime where the spin dynamics are described by sfmft and hole dynamics by sbmft with both @xmath24 and @xmath198 in a naive mean - field picture . however , as pointed out in last section , this state can not exists because @xmath198 implies that the ( bosonic ) topological spin excitations are confined and as a result we can not have both @xmath24 and @xmath199 in the ground state .",
    "therefore , we must have @xmath199 in order to have a consistent phase diagram , i.e. we expect that the bosonic holes are in a disordered ( insulator ) state at this regime of the phase diagram . as a result",
    "we expect @xmath277 , as is assumed in the previous subsection ( fig.(2b ) ) .",
    "the general @xmath2 phase diagram based on our duality picture is shown in fig.3 .",
    "we note that there are four different low temperature regions in the phase diagram .",
    "region i is the renormalized classical regime of sfmft . in this regime the ( topological )",
    "fermionic spin and bosonic charge excitations are gapped and confined . in the absence of potential disorder ,",
    "long - ranged ( spiral ) magnetic ordering is expected to exist in this regime when interlayer coupling is included .",
    "region ii is a new regime coming from the duality picture .",
    "in this regime the holes are in the mott insulator state but long - ranged magnetic ordering still exists .",
    "notice that the nature of the magnetic ordering is unclear in this regime . in sfmft",
    ", spiral ordering comes as a result of formation of fermionic hole pockets@xcite at momentum points @xmath278 .",
    "however , the hole pockets are gradually destroyed at this region of the phase diagram and we expect that long - range spiral ordering should also be destroyed . it is known experimentally that the effect of potential disorder is very important in the antiferromagnetic and spin - glass regime of high-@xmath1 cuprates@xcite . in particular , it seems that the holes in the antiferromagnetic phase are always localized by disorder and long - range spiral ordering never appears@xcite .",
    "it is expected that the potential disorder will also affect the magnetic behaviour at region ii strongly and the precise nature of the ground state is unclear . in particular , a spin - glass like phase may appear if the localized holes are mobile enough at short distance scale so that random long - ranged spin - distortions are set up in the system@xcite .",
    "region iii is the spin - gap phase described by sbmft where the low energy spin excitations are described by pockets of dirac fermions and the antiferromagnetic ( spiral ) spinwaves are gapped .",
    "the holes are still in the mott insulator state . as a result",
    "the ( topological ) bosonic spin and fermionic charge excitations in this regime are gapped but _",
    "deconfined_. region iv is the @xmath198 state .",
    "the ground state is a d - wave superconductor described by sbmft .",
    "the topological excitations are _ confined _ since @xmath198 .",
    "corresponding to the zero - temperature quantum phase transitions between these four phases are three different quantum critical regimes ( a - c ) indicated on the phase - diagram .",
    "note that region iii and the corresponding quantum critical regime may vanish if @xmath279 which is allowed in the duality picture .",
    "when comparing with the experiments on monolayer copper oxides@xcite we find that the gross features of the phase diagrams can be produced in the duality picture .",
    "moreover , new branches of excitations not present in mean - field theories are predicted in the duality picture .",
    "a few experimental consequences from the duality picture will be discussed in the next section where our theory will be critically examined .",
    "there are several new results obtained in this paper . in sections",
    "ii and iii , we showed that topological spin and hole excitations exist in general in the disorder states of sfmft and sbmft , and the dynamics of these excitations can be derived under some very general assumptions .",
    "we found that the topological spin and charge excitations in one mean - field theory have same dynamics as elementary excitations in the other mean - field theory , except the appearance of energy gaps . based on this result ,",
    "we propose in section iv a duality relation between the ground states described by the two mean - field theories , namely that the ground state described by one mean - field theory can be viewed as a quantum - disordered state of the other mean - field theory .",
    "a phase diagram of @xmath0 model is constructed phenomenologically based on this assumption . in particular we find that the self - consistent requirement between the quantum - disordering effects from sfmft and sbmft implys that an intermediate insulator phase between the antiferromagnetic ( spiral ) and d - wave superconducting phases has to exist . in the following subsections",
    "we shall discuss some theoretical questions and experimental consequences of our theory .",
    "we first consider the theoretical questions .      to have some qualitative understanding on the meaning of the duality relation we shall now give a wavefunction interpretation of the relation .",
    "first we consider the spin part of the ground state wavefunction described by sfmft .",
    "as pointed out in section ii , the wavefunction corresponding to sfmft is a rvb state , where the wavefunction is a superposition of spin - singlet pairs .",
    "the relative phases between the singlet pairs are fixed in sfmft .",
    "the spin part of the ground state wavefunction described by sbmft has a similar interpretation .",
    "the wavefunction is also made up of superposition of spin - singlet pairs , and the relative phases between the singlet pairs are fixed by sbmft . the difference between sfmft and sbmft is that because of the different particle statistics used in representing the spins , the phase relations between singlet pairs are very different in the two mean - field theories@xcite .",
    "the differences in phase relations between spin - singlet pairs result in the very different physical properties represented by the two rvb wavefunctions .",
    "our duality relation suggests a connection between the two very different rvb wavefunctions , namely , the phase relation between spin singlets in one wavefunction can be obtained from quantum - disordering the phases of the other wavefunction through condensation of spinons and holons .",
    "notice that a natural consequence of this picture is that there should be no clear distinction between a high temperature short - ranged antiferromagnetic state and preformed cooper pair state in @xmath0 model when the phases between the rvb singlets pairs are randomized .",
    "differences between the two phases show up only as temperature is lowered and phase coherences between rvb pairs are built up gradually .",
    "notice that the effects of holes is not mentioned in the above picture . in our derivation of the duality relation ,",
    "we have assumed a picture of spin - charge separation where spins and holes can be considered as independent quantum liquids .",
    "this is also a major assumption we made in deriving our phase diagram .",
    "although it is believed that the picture of spin - charge separation should be correct at an intermediate temperature region above @xmath1 , it is also believed that a proper treatment of the effect of ( fictitous ) gauge fields may lead to confinement of spin and charge at low enough temperature in @xmath0 model@xcite and may modify strongly our theoretical predictions .",
    "in particular , region iii of our phase diagram may be washed away completely if spin and charge are confined by fictitious gauge fields at low energy .",
    "the effects of gauge fields are ignored in our present theory which treats the dynamics of topological spin and charge excitations only in a semi - phenomenological level . to include the effects of gauge fields properly a more microscopic understanding of topological excitations is needed and will be a direction of our future work@xcite .",
    "next we consider a few experimental consequences of the duality relations .",
    "first we consider regions i and iv where the ground states are described by sfmft and sbmft , respectively .",
    "the new features we predict in these two regimes are the existence of topological spin and charge excitations which are absent in mean - field theories .",
    "notice that as discussed in sections ii and iii , the topological excitations are _ confined _ in these regimes and are difficult to be observed in correlation functions with momentum transfer @xmath280 .",
    "nevertheless , the behavior of spin correlation functions at momentum @xmath281 is determined by the short - distance behaviours of spin _ pairs _ and should not be affected strongly by confinement . as a result , we expect that topological spin excitations may be observable in the dynamic structure factor @xmath282 at momenta @xmath281@xcite . a more detailed analysis of the effects of topological spin excitations in the @xmath49 limit ( heisenberg model ) was given in ref.@xcite ( see also ref.@xcite ) .",
    "notice that gapped incommensurate spinwave excitations with momentum @xmath283 and @xmath284 have been observed experimentally in the underdoped regime of high-@xmath1 cuprates@xcite which we believe , can be identified with the bosonic topological spin excitations in the d - wave superconductor phase .",
    "notice that the topological excitations can be observed more easily in the underdoped regime at @xmath285 or at the spin - gap phase ( region iii ) where confinement effect is absent .",
    "the spin - gap phase has low - energy spin dynamics of d - wave superconductors but is insulating otherwise .",
    "it would be interesting to see whether this phase can be observed in cuprates .",
    "lastly we discuss region ii .",
    "this is a regime where our understanding is poorest .",
    "based on our analysis we expect that the system is in an insulator phase where charge excitations are gapped , and the spins are in some kind of long - ranged order state . however , the nature of the spin - ordering is unclear , especially in the presence of impurities .",
    "we expect that this phase may corresponds to the spin - glass phase@xcite observed experimentally .",
    "theoretical understanding of spin dynamics at this regime is still very limited@xcite .",
    "notice that it is found experimentally that the in - plane resistance of the cuprates at the spin - glass regime goes as @xmath286 at high enough temperature , before the systems become insulating@xcite . within our duality picture ,",
    "a plausible explanation is that the low energy hole excitations are already slave - boson - like in the spin - glass phase .",
    "the transport behaviours of the systems at high enough temperature should be described by sbmft , which predicts @xmath286 at high enough temperature because of gauge field fluctuations .",
