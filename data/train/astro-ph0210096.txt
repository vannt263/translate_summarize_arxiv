    "the incoming radiation is split into two , ideally orthogonal , components , @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( using , for example an ortho - mode transducer or omt ) .",
    "these components are possibly amplified and coupled into a detector that measures the polarization either by differencing or by correlation .",
    "ideally the transfer matrix of the components that split and couple the radiation into the detector is proportional to the identity matrix : @xmath41 . in reality",
    "it contains systematic errors so that @xmath42 .",
    "let us parameterize these errors as @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 are fluctuations in the gains ( or , more generally , coupling efficiencies ) of the two lines , @xmath45 is the phase difference between the lines , @xmath46 express the non - orthogonality or cross - coupling between the lines , and @xmath47 are the phases of these couplings .",

    "bolometer systems can be modeled with this set up , although the means of separating the two polarization states and the exact meaning of the parameters ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) may differ ( see @xcite for polarization sensitive bolometers ) . under the assumption that @xmath44 , @xmath46 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 so common - mode gain fluctuations act as a normalization error @xmath53 on @xmath13 , the cross - couplings act as a rotation @xmath54 and differential gain fluctuations leak temperature into polarization @xmath55 .",
    "now consider a simple correlation polarimeter where the signal in the two lines are correlated as @xmath56 which forms an estimate of @xmath14 in the instrument basis ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "then the errors in the determination become @xmath57 so again @xmath58 , @xmath59 but leakage from @xmath12 into @xmath14 is given by @xmath60 . instead of differential gain fluctuations",
    ", the cross - coupling between the lines is responsible for the monopole leakage in a correlation system .",
    "notice that under the assumption of @xmath51 and vanishing intrinsic @xmath15 , the phase error @xmath45 does not appear to first order .",
    "it is instructive to consider the case where @xmath45 is large , say @xmath61 . in this case",
    "the correlation polarimeter actually measures @xmath15 not @xmath14 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : block ] ) . in general , the phase error @xmath45 rotates @xmath14 into @xmath15 .",
    "a complex correlation polarimeter actually takes advantage of the ( @xmath14,@xmath15 ) rotation to measure ( @xmath13,@xmath14 ) simultaneously ( e.g. @xcite ) . here ,",

    "errors in the polarization sensitivity of the detector system that vary with time will translate into errors in the polarization sky maps that vary with position .",

    "@xmath79 is the pointing matrix and in its simplest incarnation just encodes the sky pixel at which the instrument is pointed at the given time .",
    "more generally the pointing matrix also encodes the beam and the chopping strategy where different pointings are differenced to remove systematic offsets .",
    "the additional complication for polarization is that the pointing matrix also has to encode the orientation of the instrument to transform @xmath80 in the instrument basis to the fixed sky .",
    "this is an advantage since systematic errors like the monopole leakage @xmath37 are fixed to the instrument basis and not the sky .",

    ", the weighting simply averages the @xmath78 separate pointings for each pixel .",
    "if the systematic fields , e.g. the calibration error @xmath83 were uncorrelated in time , they would remain so in the map but with a variance that is reduced by @xmath84 .",
    "low frequency temporal correlations in the systematics will produce correlated noise in the map .",

    "we truncate the local coupling at the dipole level for the polarization and the quadrupole level for the temperature .",
    "these terms have a direct correspondence to known systematics as we shall see .",
    "more generally , the form of these couplings is dictated by the properties of the polarization field under rotation and can be generalized to higher order in a straightforward manner .",
    "local couplings are primarily due to imperfections in the beams . even a perfectly on - axis",
    ", azimuthally symmetric telescope will not in general produce a completely azimuthally symmetric and perfectly polarized beam . in general",
    "the beam has a finite ellipticity along the axis of polarization , and there is a",
    " cross - polar \" beam which couples to the ",

    "both these imperfections arise because the surface normal to the optics has different orientations with respect to polarization axis depending on where the incident radiation strikes the telescope @xcite .    as an illustrative model of these effects , consider the case where the receiver on the telescope is a simple differencing polarimeter . here",

    "a pointing offset in both beams becomes a gradient coupling in polarization and a differential beam ellipticity or `` squash '' becomes a coupling to the temperature quadrupole .",
    "these have a clear correspondence to the local contamination model of eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : localmodel ] ) . a differential pointing offset , or `` squint '' translates into coupling to the temperature dipole .",

    "( [ eqn : localmodel ] ) with @xmath73 referenced to the sky ( not the instrument ) does transform as polarization and so should be viewed as the residual dipole sensitivity after correction .",
    "the quadrupolar coupling is particularly dangerous since it behaves precisely as a polarization and can not be removed through rotation of the instrument .",
    "for example , even a circularly symmetric temperature hot spot becomes a radial pattern of polarization through its local quadrupole moment .",
    "these leakage terms also appear if the receiver is a correlation polarimeter . in this case",
    ", the leakage from temperature to polarization is due to the amplitude and shape of the cross - polar beam instead of asymmetries in the main beam @xcite .",
    "however , because both of these imperfections have a common origin in the variations in the boundary conditions at optical surfaces , it turns out that a differencing system or a correlation polarimeter will obtain similar leakage terms due to the local effects ( after accounting for the orientation of the receiver with respect to the optics ) @xcite .",
    "interferometric polarimeters have related effects on the scale of the primary beam although some of the implications for @xmath0-modes will differ since the measured modes are below the beam scale @xcite .",
    "if stable , these effects can be removed given a beam measurement and the true temperature field on the sky using the formalism of anisotropic polarized beams @xcite .",

    "these errors are associated with calibration , rotation , pointing ( 2 ) , spin flip ( 2 ) , monopole leakage ( 2 ) , dipole leakage ( 2 ) and quadrupole leakage .",
    "the three temperature leakage effects are named for the type of temperature fluctuation across the beam scale that they respond to and are especially dangerous due to the extremely low level of polarization expected in the @xmath0-modes .",
    "monopole leakage generally arises in the receiver ; dipole and quadrupole leakage are associated with asymmetries in the beam .",
    "we have illustrated these problems by modelling the fluctuations in these contamination fields with an rms amplitude and coherence .",
    "in general , it is _ not _ sufficient to control the fluctuations in the field on the degree scales of interest for gravitational wave @xmath0-modes . because all of these effects transfer power from the cmb fluctuations themselves , the most dangerous fluctuations are those that are on the same scale as most of the power in the cmb fields . for all but the monopole leakage effect , which can draw power out of the first acoustic peak ,",
    "the underlying power lies at the diffusion damping scale of @xmath190 or @xmath166 .",
    "unless the beam resolves this scale , even uncorrelated white noise fluctuations in the fields can substantially contaminate low multipoles in @xmath0 .",
    "the interplay between the beam scale and @xmath162 coherence scale of the cmb fields plays an especially important role in pointing , dipole leakage and quadrupole leakage .",
    "these problems couple local derivatives of the cmb fields into false polarization signals .",
    "they can largely be eliminated if the beam is sufficiently small so that the cmb fields are smooth across the beam scale .",
    "small beams are also desirable for constructing weak lensing mass maps from the @xmath0-mode polarization @xcite .    based on the systematic errors of the current generation of experiments , these problems",
    "should be challenging but not insurmountable .",
    "the dasi instrument had percent level monopole leakage which was stable at the fractional percent level and quadrupole leakage also at the percent level which was highly stable .",
    "it also had rotational uncertainties at the percent level @xcite .",
    "the pique instrument had a monople leakage at under the percent level and a dipole leakage at less than 2.5% @xcite .",
    "the polarization sensitive bolometers for the upcoming boomerang experiment @xcite and planned for planck have monopole leakage at the percent level but are claimed to be very stable .",
    "this exploratory study of polarization effects should help to provide some rough guidance on the long road ahead toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves from inflation .",
