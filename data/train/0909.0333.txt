    "nuclei at finite temperature are usually studied microscopically using the finite temperature hartree - fock ( hf ) or hartree - fock bogoliubov ( hfb ) approximations ( ref .",
    "[ 1],[2 ] ) , at least at first level of approximation .",
    "the basic quantity is the grand canonical partition function or equivalently the grand potential .",
    "such a quantity contains an average of all possible contributions from different conserved quantum numbers such as angular momentum , parity and particle number .",
    "it is of course of great physical interest to study the partition function and related thermal averages using the partition function projected to the exact quantum numbers .",
    "this is especially true if the projection to good angular momentum is carried out without any assumption about axial symmetry , that is , if the full three dimensional angular momentum projector is used . as the temperature increases",
    ", we expect triaxial shapes to play a role and it is interesting to see how shape transitions are obtained at different excitation energies .    sometimes the full projector is replaced by a partial projector to good z - component of the angular momentum @xmath0 .",
    "the partition function for a specified value of the angular momentum @xmath1 is then obtained by subtraction between the partition function at a @xmath0 and the partition function at @xmath2 .",
    "this recipe , however , has a basic limitation that requires the exact evaluation of the partition function .",
    "this limitation is of course a problem when using even accurate approximations such as the hfb .",
    "moreover , in the limit of @xmath3 temperature , the hfb ground state for a specified value of @xmath0 is not as accurate as the ground state obtained with a specified value of @xmath1 .",
    "also , the above recipe would pose severe problems for odd and odd - odd nuclei .",
    "therefore , the use of the exact angular momentum projector is highly desirable .    in the case of the the temperature dependent hfb approximation ,",
    "a standard result for the trace of the statistical density operator ( the exponential of a quadratic form in the quasi - particle operators ) states that it can be recast as a square root of a determinant ( ref.[3 ] ) .",
    "this is a problem if the projected partition function is required , since an improper sign can lead to erroneous results . in the past the cure for this problem has been given with the so - called continuity argument .",
    "this argument states that the proper sign can be determined by constructing the statistical density operator from unity and then by determining the appropriate sign by imposing the continuity of the phase of the trace as we progressively rebuild the statistical density operator .",
    "this has been the recipe followed in ref . [ 3 ] .",
    "recently this problem has been considered anew using the grassmann algebra ( ref.[4 ] ) for the determination of the sign for both overlaps of hfb wave functions and the trace of the statistical density operator ( ref.[5 ] ) . although the results obtained were not previously reported in the literature , in the case of the trace of the statistical density operator , the sign ambiguity was not fully resolved since the vacuum contribution was still left as the square root of a determinant .",
    "the purpose of this work is to show how all possible ambiguities can be resolved without referring to a numerical continuity argument , which may not be easy to implement . in the next section",
    "we shall derive the construction of the proper sign for the trace of the statistical density operator in rather general terms starting from the properties of the lie algebra of the generators of the statistical density operators as described in ref . [ 6 ] .",
    "therefore the hfb approximation is only a special case of the recipe described below .",
    "_ @xmath4 symbols , definitions and basic properties .",
    "_    as mentioned in the introduction we shall keep the discussion as general as possible .",
    "let @xmath5 be the total number of the single particle states ( that is neutrons plus protons ) .",
    "let us consider an arbitrary antisymmetric complex @xmath6 matrix @xmath7 and let us define the row vector @xmath8 , the collection of all annihilation and of all creation operators .",
    "in order to use consistently the matrix notations let us denote the column vector @xmath9 .",
    "a general statistical density operator ( sdo for short ) is written as @xmath10 no other limitations are imposed on this operator , except for the antisymmetry of the matrix @xmath7 .",
    "also let us define the @xmath11 matrix @xmath12 and the vectors @xmath13 eq .",
    "( 1 ) can be recast as @xmath14 this is the form of the sdo we shall use in the following . in the case of the hfb approximation",
    "@xmath15 is hermitian . to any operator of the form of eq.(4 ) one can associate the matrix ( without the caret ) @xmath16 following ref . [",
    "6 ] , the exponents of operators as in eq.(4 ) form a lie algebra , and therefore the product of any two exponential operators of this form is an operator of the same form , moreover the product preserves the association of eq.(5 ) that is , if @xmath17 also @xmath18 for example , @xmath19 is the rotation operator in terms of the euler angles .",
    "in general , an arbitrary sdo is constructed as a product of several operators of the class of eq.(4 ) , and for each one of them we know unambiguously the matrix @xmath15 of eq.(4 ) .",
    "( 6 ) tells us that the matrix @xmath15 corresponding to the product @xmath20 exists , but we can not reconstruct this matrix from eq.(7 ) because of the @xmath21 ambiguity of the logarithm of the eigenvalues of @xmath22 .",
    "this is the source of the sign ambiguity is the evaluation of the traces . from ref .",
    "[ 6 ] , the operators of the class ( 4 ) transform the vectors @xmath23 in the following way @xmath24 where @xmath25 denote the transpose of the matrix @xmath22",
    ". moreover the following relation holds ( cf . ref .",
    "[ 6 ] ) @xmath26 it ensures that the transformed operators in eq .",
    "( 8) obey the anticommutation relations .",
    "_ @xmath27 the trace in the case the matrix @xmath15 is known . _",
    "if the matrix @xmath15 in eq.(5 ) is known , the grand canonical trace of @xmath20 can easily be evaluated without ambiguities .",
    "let us prove it in the most general case , assuming @xmath15 is known .",
    "consider a sdo @xmath28 , then @xmath29 where eq.(8 ) has been used .",
    "we shall prove that the matrix @xmath30 that diagonalizes @xmath15 satisfies eq.(9 ) .",
    "it is easy to see that the eigenvalues of @xmath15 come in opposite pairs .",
    "in fact , the eigenvalue problem for @xmath31 written in the form ( @xmath30 is the matrix of the eigenvectors and the @xmath32 s are the eigenvalues written in block form for convenience ) @xmath33    can be rewritten as @xmath34 but @xmath35 hence @xmath36 .",
    "the trace can now be trivially evaluated and the result is @xmath37 provided one can show that @xmath28 is an element of the class of eq.(4 ) , that is , provided its associated matrix @xmath30 satisfies eq.(9 ) ( which guarantees the legitimacy of the chain of steps in eq.(10 ) ) . in order to see this , consider the eigenvalue problem for @xmath22 written as @xmath38 by applying at the left and at the right the matrix @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) and taking into account eq.(9 ) one has @xmath41 taking the inverse and the transpose of the above we obtain @xmath42 therefore @xmath43 and @xmath44 coincide apart a normalization constant @xmath45 .",
    "if @xmath46 is the diagonal matrix of elements @xmath47 then @xmath48 evaluating the above product one can show that @xmath46 has the doublet structure @xmath49 .",
    "therefore @xmath50 and from this it follows that if @xmath30 does not satisfy eq .",
    "( 9 ) the matrix @xmath51 does .",
    "( 12 ) for the trace does not have any sign ambiguity since we had access to the eigenvalues of @xmath15 . if we do not have access to the matrix s , from eq .",
    "( 12 ) taking the square , we have @xmath52 since we always have access to eigenvalues of @xmath22 .",
    "this is where the sign ambiguity comes from .",
    "if we work with @xmath22 obtained from eq.(7 ) , we never have access to the matrix @xmath15 although we know it exists .    _ @xmath53 the contribution of the vacuum .",
    "_    consider now the fugacity dependent trace @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 is the particle number operator .",
    "for @xmath57 we isolate the contribution of the vacuum .",
    "let us define the operator of the class ( 4 ) @xmath58 and its associated matrix @xmath59 let us set @xmath60 .",
    "this operator has an associated matrix @xmath61 .",
    "explicitly @xmath62 then @xmath63 this expression can be recast as @xmath64 where @xmath65 since @xmath66 is a polynomial in @xmath67 the eigenvalues of @xmath68 must come in degenerate pairs @xmath69 .",
    "this argument is the similar to the one used in ref .",
    "[ 7].therefore @xmath70 it follows that , if we know the matrix @xmath15 ( the log of @xmath22 ) then , using eq.(12 ) , @xmath71 where we have set @xmath72 .",
    "there are no sign ambiguities in @xmath73 since its sign must be a continuous function of @xmath67 . the only ambiguity is the @xmath74 and it is removed by eq.(12 ) .",
    "eq.(26 ) is the basic equation that allows us to remove the sign ambiguity also in the general case when we do not know the matrix @xmath15 and its eigenvalues unambiguously , as shown in the next subsection . before leaving this section",
    "let us note that for @xmath57 we obtain the vacuum contribution to the grand canoncal trace of @xmath20 @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the particle vacuum .",
    "_ @xmath77 the trace in the general case .",
    "_    consider the sdo of the type @xmath78 where @xmath79 are of the type of eq.(4 ) , and let us assume we know explicitly the matrices @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "as previously mentioned , we do not know unambiguously the matrix @xmath15 associated with @xmath20 , although we know the matrix @xmath22 associated with @xmath20 , since @xmath82 . in what follows",
    "we shall need the following matrices @xmath83 using eq.(25 ) ( with @xmath72 ) we have @xmath84_{22})^{1/2 } \\prod_{k=1}^{n_s}(1 + \\mu_k ) \\eqno(30)\\ ] ] the square root of the determinant can be evaluated in the following way .",
    "consider the vacuum expectation value @xmath85 .",
    "then ( cf .",
    "eq.(27 ) ) @xmath86_{22})^{1/2 } \\eqno(31)\\ ] ] direct evaluation of the matrix product gives @xmath87)^{1/2 } \\eqno(32)\\ ] ] or @xmath88 since this vacuum contribution must be a polynomial in @xmath67 , the eigenvalues of @xmath89 must come in degenerate pairs @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , considering only one eigenvalue for each degenerate pair , @xmath91    finally setting @xmath72 , we obtain for the grand - canonical trace @xmath92 the only sign ambiguity in eq.(35 ) comes from the contributions of the two square roots . from eq.(34 ) ( for @xmath57 ) , one can see that each square root is again the vacuum contribution from @xmath93 and @xmath94 , but we know already as to remove this ambiguity using eq .",
    "( 26 ) for each @xmath95 , since we know the matrices @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "these considerations can easily be extended to a product of several sdo s .    as a final remark",
    ", it is possible ( using eq .",
    "( 9 ) ) to prove that the matrices @xmath96 and @xmath97 are antisymmetric and therefore these arguments amount to a quantum mechanical proof of the statement that the product of two antisymmetric matrices has eigenvalues in degenerate pairs ( even @xmath5 ) or the odd one is zero ( odd @xmath5 ) .    _",
    "@xmath98 a numerical test .",
    "_    essentially our method to fix the sign of the square root in the general case is based on an analytical continuity argument , supplemented by the fact that we know the contribution of the vacua of the factors @xmath99 , because of eqs.(12 ) and ( 26 ) .",
    "we performed extensive numerical tests of eq.(35 ) , by considering an ensemble of @xmath100 antisymmetric random matrices with matrix elements uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath101 and @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "this random set generates the matrices @xmath104 and @xmath105 and from eq.(4 ) the matrices @xmath80 and @xmath81 . to test the above method we consider the matrices @xmath106 and @xmath107 with @xmath108 varying from @xmath3 to @xmath109 in sufficiently small steps , so that a numerical continuity argument can be tested .",
    "we also have used the conventional way of evaluating the grand canonical trace , by taking the square of eq.(35 ) and then numerically evaluating the square root and then following the phase of this square root as @xmath108 is varied from @xmath3 to @xmath109 .",
    "more precisely , we evaluate the phase of the grand canonical trace and , if the phase changes between consecutive values of @xmath108 by an amount larger than some value @xmath110 we change the phase by @xmath111 . in many cases",
    "the numerical continuity argument agrees with eq.(35 ) but in some case we found a sign disagreement .",
    "it is instructive to analyze these latter cases . in fig.(1 ) we show the phase of eq.(35 ) as a function of @xmath108 for one of these instances , and in fig .",
    "( 2 ) we show the phase for the same trace evaluated with the numerical continuity argument with two different step sizes . for a relatively small number of steps ( @xmath112",
    ", the phase shows a discontinuity , while for a much larger number of steps ( @xmath113 ) , the continuity of the phase as a function of @xmath108 is restored . the maximum phase change from one step to the next",
    "has been kept fixed for both cases to @xmath114 . from fig.(2 ) we see that the source of the discontinuity is the rather large change in the phase for small variations of @xmath108 , which is associated with a vertical slope of the phase . in this instance",
    "even @xmath115 steps fail to reproduce the continuity of the phase .",
    "this rather surprising result , was obtained because of the disagreement with eq.(35 ) , otherwise it would have gone undetected . if we have to check the continuity of the phase for hundreds of cases ( as it is in the case of the angular momentum projection ) , we can hardly check every single instance to insure the proper phase .",
    "if we consider smaller values of @xmath110 we may need several thousands steps to restore continuity .",
    "this pathological behavior of the numerical continuity argument was found in presence of a vertical slope .    ]    , obtained with the numerical continuity method . ]",
    "this example does show the limitations of the numerical continuity method .",
    "in this work we have shown that the sign ambiguity in the evaluation of the trace of statistical density operator written as a product of elementary statistical density operators ( this is usually the case in physical applications ) can be effectively removed by considering all factors separately , evaluating the vacuum contributions using eq.(12 ) , then reconstructing the vacuum contribution of the full statistical density operator without taking any square root of determinant using eqs .",
    "quite surprisingly , a numerical continuity argument , computationally more involved , can fail to reproduce the proper sign in some numerical test cases , unless we use a large number of steps .",
    "the recipe presented in this work opens the possibility to perform calculations of grand canonical partition functions within the hfb formalism with projectors to good quantum numbers .",
