    "the chain @xmath10 rationally bounds a positive immersed surface in @xmath1 .",
    "but an immersion between hyperbolic surfaces with geodesic boundary is necessarily @xmath119-injective .",
    "theorem  c unfortunately does not settle the question of whether @xmath20 is rational in closed ( orientable ) surface groups . a positive immersed surface @xmath58 with rational boundary a chain @xmath323 is extremal in its relative homology class , but the set of relative homology classes with boundary @xmath10 is a torsor for the group @xmath324 , which is infinite when @xmath1 is closed and orientable .",
    "one can translate this into an absolute statement about @xmath20 at slight cost .",
    "let @xmath1 be a closed hyperbolic surface , and let @xmath325 be the unit tangent bundle of @xmath1 .",
    "the euler class of @xmath325 , thought of as an oriented circle bundle over @xmath1 , is an element of @xmath326 whose evaluation on the fundamental class of @xmath1 is @xmath327 .",
    "the fundamental group of @xmath325 is a central extension @xmath328 corresponding to the euler class in @xmath326 .",

    "the next corollary is a purely group - theoretic statement about homologically trivial elements in closed surface groups .",
    "[ bounds_in_free_subgroup ] let @xmath12 be a closed , orientable surface group with negative euler characteristic , and @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "then there is a free subgroup @xmath6 of @xmath12 and elements @xmath101 which are conjugates of positive powers of @xmath14 such that every @xmath334 , and the product of the @xmath101 is in @xmath335 $ ] .",
    "corollary  [ bounds_in_free_subgroup ] can be thought of as saying that a homologically trivial loop in a closed surface is covered by a homologically trivial @xmath9-manifold in some surface of infinite index .",
    "one can ask to make this result sharper :    let @xmath12 be a closed , orientable surface group with negative euler characteristic , and @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "is there a free subgroup @xmath6 of @xmath12 such that @xmath56 $ ] ?",
    "one can ask an analogous question for any group @xmath12 .",
    "this question is especially interesting when @xmath336 where @xmath325 is a closed @xmath45-manifold .",
    "finally , we can use theorem  c to construct injective closed surface groups representing homology classes in certain graphs of groups .",
    "the following is the analogue of the main theorem from @xcite .",
    "let @xmath12 be a graph of free and closed orientable surface groups with @xmath337 amalgamated along cyclic subgroups , and let @xmath70 be a homology class in @xmath338 .",
    "let @xmath339 be the closed surface vertex subgroups , and @xmath340 any rational numbers with all @xmath341 sufficiently large .",
    "then the class @xmath342 is rationally represented by a closed surface subgroup of @xmath12 .",
    "this follows immediately by the argument of thm .  3.4 from @xcite , and theorem  c.    it is natural to wonder whether every rational chain in @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a free group , is projectively contained in the interior of a face of the @xmath20 norm of finite codimension , but in fact this is not the case , as the following example shows .",
    "[ infinite_codimension ] by bavard duality , the codimension of the face whose interior contains the projective class of a rational chain @xmath10 is one less than the dimension of the space of extremal quasimorphisms for @xmath10 ( mod @xmath48 ) .",
    "hence to exhibit a rational chain ( in fact , an element of @xmath335 $ ] ) which is in the interior of a face of infinite codimension , it suffices to exhibit a chain which admits an infinite dimensional space of extremal quasimorphisms .",
    "let @xmath343 where @xmath344 and @xmath293 are both free of rank at least @xmath22 , and let @xmath345 $ ] be nontrivial .",
    "let @xmath346 be extremal for @xmath14 , and let @xmath347 be arbitrary with @xmath348 . by the hahn - banach theorem",
    ", there exists @xmath349 which agrees with @xmath350 on @xmath351 , and satisfies @xmath352 .    another ( more direct ) way to see",
    "that @xmath14 is contained in a face of infinite codimension is as follows .",
    "let @xmath353 be a nontrivial element of @xmath354 $ ] .",
    "let @xmath355 be a @xmath356 ( e.g. a wedge of two circles ) for @xmath357 .",
    "let @xmath17 be a @xmath358 obtained by joining @xmath359 to @xmath360 by an edge @xmath361 .",
    "let @xmath77 be extremal for the chain @xmath362 .",
    "if @xmath1 maps over @xmath361 , we can compress @xmath1 along the preimage of a generic point on @xmath361 , reducing @xmath363 , which is absurd since @xmath1 is extremal .",
    "hence @xmath1 consists of two surfaces @xmath364 one of which is extremal for @xmath365 in @xmath359 , and one of which is extremal for @xmath353 in @xmath360 .",
    "hence @xmath366 so @xmath14 is not in the interior of a top face of the @xmath20 norm restricted to the vector subspace of @xmath5 spanned by @xmath14 and @xmath353 .",
