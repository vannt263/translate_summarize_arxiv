    "there are currently intense efforts to confirm and extend the evidence for neutrino oscillations in the atmospheric and solar sectors .",
    "in particular the disappearance of muon neutrinos originating from cosmic ray interactions  @xcite provides a strong hint in favour of @xmath7 oscillations .",
    "this indication will be tested in a conclusive manner at the next generation of long baseline experiments . in a simple two - flavour mixing scheme",
    "the atmospheric neutrino experiments constrain the mixing parameter in the region around ( @xmath8 , @xmath9)=(@xmath10 , 1 ) .",
    "recently , the sno experiment gave an unambiguous signature of the solar neutrino oscillations , excluding the sterile neutrino hypothesis  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the dominant @xmath7 component , sub - dominant oscillations involving also @xmath11 could be observed . in this three - flavour scenario",
    "the gauge eigenstates @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) are related to the mass eigenstates @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) through the leptonic mixing matrix @xmath16 .",
    "this matrix can be parametrized as :    @xmath17    with @xmath18 and @xmath19 .    here",
    "the leading @xmath7 transitions are driven by the angle @xmath20 and the squared mass difference @xmath21 .",
    "sub - dominant @xmath22 oscillations at the atmospheric scale ( @xmath23 ) are driven by the mixing angle @xmath1 .",
    "this angle is constrained by the chooz experiment to be small ( @xmath24 )  @xcite .",
    "the next generation of long baseline experiments  minos  @xcite , icarus  @xcite and opera  @xcite  will search for a conclusive evidence of the oscillation mechanism at the atmospheric scale .",
    "in particular , the cngs beam  @xcite will directly confirm the indication for neutrino oscillations through tau appearance .",
    "although the precision that will be achieved on the parameters driving the dominant @xmath25 after this first generation of long baseline experiments is well established  @xcite , the sensitivity to the sub - dominant @xmath22 channel deserves further investigation , in particular for what concerns cngs .",
    "this is due to the fact that only recently the baseline configuration of the cngs detectors ( icarus  @xcite and opera  @xcite ) has been established .",
    "moreover , a full @xmath22 analysis with the opera experiment has not been carried out yet .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the sensitivity of the icarus and opera experiments in searching for @xmath1 by using the present cngs neutrino beam .",
    "the sensitivity of icarus to @xmath1 has been evaluated in  @xcite . for opera ,",
    "whose primary aim is the direct detection of @xmath2 appearance , a preliminary estimate of the sensitivity to @xmath22 oscillations has been given in the 1999 letter of intent  @xcite and is evaluated here in more details .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section  [ cngs - program ] we briefly describe the present cngs neutrino beam , the icarus and opera experimental setups and their features ; in section  [ sensi ] we discuss the icarus and opera sensitivity to @xmath1 ; finally in section  [ conclu ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "in november 2000 a new version of the cngs beam design was released  @xcite . in tables  [ tab : results1 ] and  [ tab : results2 ] , the performance of the beam are given .",
    "+    .nominal performance of the cngs reference beam  @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : limits ]",
    "the opera experiment was designed and optimised for the direct observation of the @xmath26 decay topology and to search for @xmath2 appearance at the @xmath8 atmospheric scale .",
    "nevertheless , given the good electron identification , it turned out to be sensitive to the sub - dominant @xmath22 oscillations in the region indicated by atmospheric results . exploring the region of @xmath3 is particularly interesting in connection with the discovery of cp violation in the leptonic sector  @xcite .",
    "hence , an observation of @xmath27 in the region of @xmath28 would place future cp violation searches like jhf phase 2 and the neutrino factories on firmer ground .",
    "we showed that by using the present cngs beam and combining the icarus and opera experiments a sensitivity in @xmath27 down to 0.03 ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) can be achieved .",
    "it can be further improved if a higher intensity ( @xmath31  pot / year ) will be reached .",
