    "the overall divergence is polynomial in the nonrelativistic energy @xmath62 of the top quarks , but contributes to the cross section if @xmath63 , since the correlation function is evaluated at complex values @xmath64 .",

    "[ fig3 ] ) reproduces eq .",
    "( [ eq : tree ] ) when @xmath11 is treated as an insertion .",

    "using dimensional regularization these subleading contributions can lead to @xmath81 singularities if the high energy behaviour of the eft phase space integration is logarithmic . the lesson from this",
    "is that the pure resonant result alone that is usually shown in the literature is inconsistent theoretically and must be supplemented with additional short - distance information from the systematic calculation of the @xmath23 process .",
    "since the full - theory calculation is finite , the uv divergence in the nnlo resonant part must cancel with an infrared divergence that appears in the non - resonant term in unstable - particle effective theory from diagrams corresponding to off - shell top - quark decay , as discussed in @xcite .",

    "r0.4        divergences in the non - resonant part arise when the top ( or antitop ) propagators go on - shell  @xcite .",
    "this is a consequence of the hard momentum region expansion , which sets @xmath86 in the top - antitop propagators and forces to retain the leading order term of the upper kinematic limit in @xmath87 : @xmath88 .",

    "[ fig : h1cor ] yields non - zero contributions with @xmath98 , and one can check that the resulting divergences cancel those in the resonant part of the full - theory diagram .",
    "clearly , the complexity associated with the evaluation of the full nnlo set of non - resonant corrections calls for a numerical implementation using monte carlo methods for the phase space integration .",
    "such an implementation requires that the end - point divergences occurring in the diagrams are identified and subtracted from the amplitude , together with the soft - collinear divergences that show up at nnlo due to gluon radiation .",
    "the complete set of nnlo non - resonant singularities shall be available soon  @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that the leading term of the expansion in @xmath99 of the nnlo non - resonant contribution to the total cross section has been given in ref .",
    "the accuracy of such an approximation , though , can not be estimated reliably without further knowledge of the size of subleading terms in the @xmath44-expansion .",
    "an alternative approach to account for non - resonant effects has been developed in parallel  @xcite that includes the effects of invariant - mass cuts on the @xmath25 pairs entirely through calculations in an extended version of nrqcd which accounts for unstable particle effects systematically  @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the uv - divergences from the resonant matrix elements are compensated by imaginary counter - terms associated with the @xmath100 forward - scattering operators , which thus acquire an imaginary anomalous dimension and sum large logarithms of the top velocity . in ref .",
    "@xcite we demonstrate that for moderate top invariant mass cuts of the form ( [ eq : invarmasscuts ] ) with @xmath101  gev , the matching conditions of the @xmath100 forward scattering operators are dominated by the nrqcd phase space contributions , i.e.  they can be computed from the difference between the ( potentially ) divergent nrqcd phase space integrations without any cuts and the ones with the cuts in eq .",

    "this is because using the @xmath102 scheme in nrqcd diagrams involving the unstable top propagator of eq .",
    "( [ unstableprop ] ) largely overestimates the contributions from unphysical phase space regions that are parametrically away from the potential , soft and ultrasoft regions that can be described by nrqcd .",
    "thus the main numerical effect of the `` phase space matching '' procedure is obtained by removing these unphysical contributions and can be carried out within nrqcd itself .    an important conceptual aspect of the invariant mass cuts defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : invarmasscuts ] ) is that already for moderate cuts @xmath103  gev the cut @xmath104 on the nonrelativistic ( anti)top three - momentum @xmath105 is @xmath106  gev , and thus represents a hard scale of the order @xmath107 .",
    "this justifies the implementation of the phase space effects into the matching conditions of the wilson coefficients . since @xmath108 is parametrically of order @xmath107 we use for our bookkeeping the counting @xmath109 . in this counting scheme",

    "forward scattering operators do not contribute , and the resulting expressions are just the nonrelativistic expansions of full theory squared matrix elements containing the square of the double resonant diagram @xmath119 ( see fig .  [",

    "this is partly due to the fact that the phase space cutoff @xmath110 is sufficiently smaller than the convergence radius of the nonrelativistic expansion .",

    "[ fig : finalqrip35gevcutnu02 ] the size of the four different types of electroweak corrections is shown for predictions of the total inclusive cross section for @xmath138  gev .",
    "we again see that the phase space matching contributions exceed by far the other electroweak corrections .",
    "the phase space matching contributions are between @xmath144 and @xmath147  fb for invariant mass cuts @xmath148 between @xmath149 and @xmath150  gev and are essential for realistic theoretical predictions . in the peak and the continuum region ( @xmath155 )",
    "they amount to @xmath156 to @xmath157% .",
    "they are particularly important in the region below the peak ( @xmath158 ) where the cross section decreases and the unphysical off - shell contributions of the nrqcd @xmath24 phase space become dominant . here the phase space matching contributions can amount to more than @xmath159% , and they ensure that the cross section has the correct physical behavior .",
    "i would like to thank the organizers for the excellent workshop and hospitality .",
    "i also thank b.  jantzen for comments on the manuscript .",
