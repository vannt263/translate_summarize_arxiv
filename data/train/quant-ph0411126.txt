    "the possibility of doing quantum computation with neutral atoms is becoming more realistic with the advances in techniques relating to the trapping of few atoms which could even be addressed individually@xcite . however",
    "a number of experiments so far have been done with flying qubits@xcite and a number of proposals exist on implementing quantum logic operations using cavity qed@xcite .",
    "we note that the realization of a gate between two qubits requires some form of interaction between the qubits .",
    "there are thus realizations which depend on the interaction between the center of mass degrees and the electronic degrees of freedom as in the case of ions@xcite , the interaction between the photonic qubit and the atom as in case of cavity qed @xcite .",
    "thus for doing logic operations with neutral atoms one would require an effective interaction between them . note that we have to keep the distance between atoms such that selective addressing is possible for one qubit operations . on the other hand if atoms are far apart then the electrostatic interaction between them is very weak .",
    "these problems can be overcome by using a high quality dispersive cavity .",
    "it has been shown earlier that the interaction of trapped atoms with a single mode of the radiation field produces an effective interaction which can be utilized for doing quantum logic@xcite .",
    "though we shall work in the framework of this physical system , it is notable that the considered hamiltonian is a special case of the lipkin model@xcite , and similar hamiltonians can be associated with the dynamics of ion traps@xcite and fe@xmath0 ions of a large magnetic molecule@xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "we shall introduce our system and qubits in section [ sec : system ] , present a brief summary of some key mathematical tools used during our calculations in section [ sec : eng2qubit ] , then in section [ sec : n2 ] and [ sec : n3 ] we shall give specific constructions of gates for @xmath1 and @xmath2 atoms , respectively .",
    "we discuss realizations of toffoli gates in section [ sec : toffoli ] , and section [ sec : conclusions ] is dedicated to our conclusions .",
    "we note that we work strictly with qubits and do not use any additional levels for the logic operation@xcite .",
    "the use of additional levels@xcite may lead to additional sources of decoherence either due to local environment or due to the fields which are used to address such levels .",
    "we consider @xmath3 two - level atoms trapped in a cavity , with the atomic transition frequency @xmath4 detuned from the cavity resonance frequency @xmath5 by some value @xmath6 , and denote the dipole coupling between an atom and the cavity by @xmath7 .",
    "the cavity losses are characterized by a constant @xmath8 that describes the coupling to an external reservoir .",
    "we do not consider atomic spontaneous decay explicitly , but we note that for large enough detuning @xmath6 , the modification of the decay rate due to the purcell effect becomes negligible .",
    "further , in order to facilitate individual addressing of the atoms , we require that the atoms are well separated , i.e.  their spatial wave functions are non - overlapping .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that if the cavity is in a thermal state with mean photon number @xmath9 , tracing out for this cavity mode in the limit @xmath10 results in a time evolution of the atoms that can well be approximated by a unitary process",
    ". the effective hamiltonian corresponding to this evolution may be written most conveniently in terms of the @xmath11 collective spin-@xmath12 and @xmath13 total angular momentum square operators defined through @xmath14 where the @xmath15 operators are the pauli-@xmath16 operators ( @xmath17 or @xmath18 ) defined on the computational basis as usual .",
    "we define the computational basis states @xmath19 and @xmath20 as the ground ( @xmath21 ) and excited ( @xmath22 ) states of the @xmath23th atom , respectively .",
    "the number of qubits is therefore equal to the number of atoms @xmath3 trapped within the cavity .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for @xmath3 atoms reads    [ eq : hs ] @xmath24 , \\label{eq : hs2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the coupling factor is @xmath25 .",
    "the main theme of this paper shall be to prove the universality of this interaction hamiltonian .",
    "for simplicity we assume that 1-qubit operations can be carried out much faster than the characteristic time of the collective interaction . to prove universality",
    "we show that this way it is possible to generate all gates .",
    "we note that the terms linear in @xmath26 in hamiltonians ( [ eq : hs ] ) correspond to 1-qubit operations .",
    "let @xmath27 denote to standard su(2 ) rotations .",
    "since @xmath26 commutes with the rest of the hamiltonian , it follows that the linear terms in hamiltonians ( [ eq : hspsm ] ) and ( [ eq : hs2 ] ) may be effectively cancelled from the time - evolution by applying @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively , to every qubit .",
    "it is important that the angle of rotation depends on the actual mean photon number ( i.e.  temperature ) of the cavity .",
    "it also depends on the time @xmath30 for which @xmath31 is to be applied , however , as it shall be shown , in the course of quantum logic gate operation , this @xmath30 is known  priori . also , because of the mentioned commutation properties this rotation can be carried out any time within the time - window prescribed by @xmath30 . later in this paper",
    "we shall work with hamiltonians ( [ eq : hs ] ) without the linear terms , and assume that the linear terms are always compensated with these 1-qubit rotations .",
    "for construction of desired two - qubit gates we have used a technique introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . for conciseness we briefly summarize this technique .",
    "we consider two two - qubit gates @xmath32 and @xmath33 , with unit determinants for now .",
    "we term them equivalent if they can be transformed into each other using only one - qubit operations @xmath34 and @xmath35 as @xmath36 here we used the tensorial product notation @xmath37 to distinguish operators acting on different subsystems .",
    "a very important result of @xcite is that this equivalence is perfectly characterized by two numbers : let @xmath38 ( @xmath39 similarly ) with @xmath40 being the unitary transformation to a specific entangled basis related to the standard bell - states , and @xmath41 ( @xmath42 similarly ) where @xmath43 denotes real transpose .",
    "then the pairs ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) and ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) coincide if and only if @xmath33 and @xmath32 are equivalent in the sense of eq .",
    "( [ eq : equivalence ] ) .",
    "an interesting side - effect is that these matrices @xmath48 and @xmath42 can be used to find the one - qubit operators @xmath49 and @xmath50 connecting two equivalent @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the recipe is as follows : first find the diagonal basis of @xmath48 ( @xmath42 ) , i.e.   write @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a diagonal matrix .",
    "then the solution can be written as    [ eq:1qb - eq ] @xmath53    these results can also be applied to matrices with non - unit determinants , and to cover that case also we associate the numbers @xmath54 \\label{eq : invariants}\\ ] ] with a matrix @xmath32 .",
    "this pair of numbers can be viewed as invariants under one - qubit operations .    the equations ( [ eq:1qb - eq ] ) can be used to construct @xmath33 using @xmath32 only if @xmath33 and @xmath32 are equivalent .",
    "however , the invariants ( [ eq : invariants ] ) can also be used to construct @xmath33 from a given matrix @xmath55 not belonging to the same equivalence class .",
    "the method relies on splitting the problem into two , by first searching for a matrix equivalent to our target @xmath33 in the form of @xmath56 , and then using ( [ eq:1qb - eq ] ) to obtain @xmath33 .",
    "solving the invariant equations is generally less involved than the solution of matrix equations .",
    "unfortunately the first step on the course is not guaranteed to work for all @xmath33 and @xmath55 .",
    "for example , a gate ( or any equivalent ) may never be constructed from gates and 1-qubit operations . for some other @xmath55 ,",
    "the construction may be possible , but only by using @xmath55 more than twice , e.g.  @xmath57 .",
    "as the simplest case we consider two atoms in the cavity .",
    "the collective spin operators now describe a spin-1 system , and a number of simplifications apply to this case . for example",
    ", the dicke states @xcite span the complete hilbert space of the two atoms and @xmath58/2 $ ] is a projector operator . considering ( [ eq : hspsm ] ) without the linear terms we have @xmath59 , and the time - evolution operator is @xmath60 in the computational basis this corresponds to the matrix @xmath61 with @xmath62 .",
    "the invariants ( [ eq : invariants ] ) of this matrix are @xmath63,\\ ] ] while for a gate we would require @xmath64 $ ] . we see that this requirement is not met by any real @xmath65 .",
    "after some algebra , however , we obtain that with @xmath66 , the sequence @xmath67 is equivalent to a gate if @xmath68 .",
    "in particular , using this equivalent gate @xmath69 a with first bit as control and second as target bit can be produced as @xmath70 the one - qubit operations of this formula being @xmath71 \\otimes    \\left [ r_x(\\pi/2 ) r_z(\\pi/4 ) \\right ] \\\\",
    "o_c   & = &   \\left [ r_z(\\pi/4 ) r_y(-\\pi/2 ) \\right ] \\otimes r_z(5\\pi/4).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the phase factor is in principle irrelevant and is written there for didactical reasons only .",
    "the construction is depicted as a quantum circuit diagram on fig .",
    "[ fig : cnot2 ] .",
    "we note here , that assuming two - qubit gates @xmath72 with equal @xmath30 , this construction is optimal in terms of operation time for the complete gate .",
    "to build quantum logic for three atoms using the hamiltonian in ( [ eq : hs ] ) we first show how to construct gates between any two atoms .",
    "the reason for constructing first a two - qubit gate from the three - atom collective interaction , rather than directly constructing a universal three - qubit gate ( e.g.  toffoli or fredkin gate ) is the lack of convenient characterization of higher qubit gates .",
    "up to date , invariants such as ( [ eq : invariants ] ) have been discovered only for two - qubit gates .    in this section",
    "we shall consider @xmath73 of ( [ eq : hs2 ] ) without the linear terms , and using this we first construct a two - qubit gate that connects only two atoms and leaves the third atom unchanged , i.e.   @xmath74 following the scheme similar to the spin - echo technique , we search for operators fulfilling ( [ eq : only - one ] ) in the form @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the time - evolution generated by the chosen hamiltonian , and @xmath77 which is essentially a gate .",
    "we pose the condition ( [ eq : only - one ] ) on ( [ eq : spin - echo ] ) to find the appropriate @xmath30 and @xmath78 .",
    "the time evolution operator @xmath79 is diagonal in the dicke - state basis . to develop further insight into the problem",
    ", we apply the theory of angular momentum addition , and separate our spin-@xmath80 system into a product of a spin-@xmath81 and a spin-@xmath82 subsystem .",
    "transformation matrix to the product basis is given by the relevant clebsch - gordan coefficients .",
    "we require that ( [ eq : spin - echo ] ) acts on the spin-1/2 subsystem as the identity , and this condition translates to @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "this gives three distinct solutions for @xmath85 for each @xmath86 via @xmath87 @xmath88 .",
    "out of these three , @xmath89 corresponds to the identity operator and is therefore irrelevant .",
    "the solutions for @xmath90 and @xmath91 are essentially the same ( adjoint of one another ) and they both have invariants @xmath92 $ ] . in the following we work out the gate explicitly for @xmath91 , because its implementation requires less time .",
    "this operation is represented by @xmath93 in the computational basis .",
    "we note that ( [ eq : u23 ] ) may be written as @xmath94 resembling the heisenberg spin - spin interaction that has found many applications in quantum information processing , most notably nmr quantum computing@xcite .",
    "however , in this case the interaction time is fixed by the conditions on @xmath30 and @xmath78 of ( [ eq : spin - echo ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , it will be seen that it is possible to express gates using this operator and 1-qubit gates .    having a well - defined two - qubit gate in hand we can again follow the recipe of sec .",
    "[ sec : eng2qubit ] . after some algebra we find that using the one - qubit operators acting on the subspace of qubits 2 and 3 , @xmath95   \\\\",
    "o_c ' & = & [ r_z(-\\pi/2 ) r_y(-\\pi ) ] \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\otimes [ r_z(\\varphi_c ' )",

    "we note here that while this implementation of gates is exact , it is not necessarily optimal , and the may be realized on this system more efficiently .",
    ") ]    universality of gates implies that having them in all configurations for three qubits allows the construction of any three - qubit quantum gate , i.e.  any su(@xmath100 ) operator . as an example we consider another important building block for systematic construction of complex quantum circuits , the toffoli gate@xcite .",
    "we also discuss a simplified version of the toffoli gate ( fig .",
    "[ fig : toffoli ] ) that differs from the toffoli gate only in one conditional phase shift whereas requiring only half the gates . in some circumstances",
    "toffoli gates may be replaced by the simplified versions .    using the expressions for gates in our three - atom system",
    ", it is straight - forward to implement both of these important quantum gates .",
    "simple arithmetic counting the number of applications of @xmath101 operations shows that the gate times for the toffoli and its simplified version add up to @xmath102 and @xmath103 , respectively .",
    "following divincenzo s criteria@xcite , for efficient error - free quantum computation these gate times should be much shorter than the coherence time of the complete system .",
    "in this paper we have shown the computational universality upto three qubits of a cavity assisted interaction between two - level atoms trapped in a dissipative cavity .",
    "in addition to the collective interaction we only needed single - qubit operations to implement multi - qubit gates . this required that the atoms are separately addressable , and we also assumed that single - atom operations can be performed on much shorter time scales than the collective interaction .",
    "the formalism used is not specific to two or three atom systems and therefore allows for further generalizations to more qubits .    in comparison with earlier proposals ,",
    "our scheme is not only robust to cavity decay , but also allows dealing with thermal cavity states in a straight - forward manner .",
    "we believe therefore that this scheme may find useful applications in situations where good localization of atoms had been achieved but the possibility of constructing good cavities is limited .",
