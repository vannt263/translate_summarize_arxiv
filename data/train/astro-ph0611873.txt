    "clusters of galaxies may provide the database needed for a coherent theory of galaxy evolution , in the same way that clusters of stars meet this need for stellar evolution .",
    "environmental effects such as tidal interactions and mergers , ram pressure stripping , and confinement of gas by the intra - cluster medium ( to name a few ) , make galaxy clusters more complex than their stellar counterparts .",
    "however the great luminosities of galaxy clusters ( and galaxies ) compensate for such complications by making it possible to directly observe their evolution to large lookback times ( for instance , stanford , eisenhardt & dickinson 1995 , 1998 , @xcite ) a luxury impractical at present for stars .",
    "this hope has already been somewhat realized in a surprisingly straightforward fashion , using the familiar color - magnitude ( c - m ) diagram .",
    "a well defined  main sequence \" of luminous early - type galaxies is evident in nearby clusters and appears to have the same slope and scatter in all systems ( @xcite , bower , lucey & ellis 1992 , terlevich , caldwell & bower 2001 , lopez - cruz , barkhouse & yee 2004 , @xcite ) and can be observed , essentially unchanged , at least to the highest redshifts studied @xcite .",
    "the color - magnitude relation appears to be mainly due to a relation between mass and metal abundance @xcite .",
    "its existence , and low scatter , may provide a stringent test of theories of galaxy formation @xcite .",
    "the observations imply a remarkably synchronized star formation history for early - type galaxies across a wide range of environments , and straightforwardly modelled by an initial burst of formation at high redshift followed by passive evolution of the stellar population , similar to the early monolithic collapse scenario of eggen , lynden - bell & sandage ( 1962 ) .",
    "measuring such changes with lookback time requires reference to color - magnitude data at the same rest wavelengths at redshift zero .",
    "the standard of reference used in @xcite , as well as many other similar studies , was the coma cluster .",
    "rich in early type galaxies and with a lookback time of only about 300 myr , multiband ( _ ubvrizjhk _ ) observations of the coma cluster were compared to observations of clusters with large lookback times using _ interpolated _ k - corrections .",
    "selecting galaxies by their near - infrared luminosity is desirable because this is representative of stellar mass ( gavazzi , pierini & boselli 1996 , bell & de jong 2001 ) and is relatively insensitive to dust and minor starbursts .",
    "the typical size of the fields observed by @xcite , and of the hst field of view at the redshifts of the clusters , is about 1 mpc . for the coma cluster",
    ", 1 mpc corresponds to @xmath12 ( h@xmath13 ) . hence obtaining and reducing the reference data , particularly in the near - infrared ,",
    "was a challenging project .",
    "because we expect that other workers will find an infrared - selected catalog of _ ubvrizjhk _ coma cluster photometry useful , we are publishing these data as a separate paper , with minimal analysis .",
    "several studies in the literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) have used this database prior to publication and we believe that this dataset will be useful for the general community .",
    "we have previously presented a study of the infrared luminosity function of coma galaxies @xcite .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : section 2 presents our observations and data reduction ; section 3 presents the photometric catalog ; and section 4 provides an analysis of color - magnitude relations and their intrinsic scatter , and a brief discussion of the implications for galaxy formation models .",
    "all photometry is on the vega system . for consistency with our previous work @xcite",
    ", we adopt a cosmology with @xmath14 km s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 . adopting a redshift of 0.023 ,",
    "this gives a luminosity distance of 104 mpc , and an angular scale of 0.482 arcseconds per kpc .",
    "for the commonly used @xmath18 km s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 cosmology , the corresponding values are 100.2 and 0.464 respectively .",
    "infrared imaging at @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 was obtained using the irim camera , with a @xmath24 nicmos3 hgcdte array at the kpno 2.1  m telescope on the night of 7 april 1993 .",
    "the pixels subtended @xmath25 , with the scale being slightly different in each band .",
    "a @xmath26 frame mosaic with @xmath27 steps ( i.e. @xmath28 overlap ) between frames in both axes was obtained in each band , spanning 29.2(ra ) @xmath29(dec ) centered on approximately 12:59:52.8 + 27:55:00 ( 2000 ) .",
    "the specific area was chosen to include the highest density region in dressler s ( 1980 ) tabulation , including dressler s numbers 82 , 91 , and 168 ( corresponding to numbers 6 , 26 , and 16 respectively in the present catalog ) near the edges of the region .",
    "two frames were omitted from the mosaic : the h frame centered near 12:59:57.4 + 28:01:39 had an anomalous sky level in one quadrant , and the k frame centered near 12:59:18.1 + 27:57:13 was lost in the data transfer process .",
    "the exposure time per frame was 15 seconds for @xmath21 and @xmath23 and 10 seconds for @xmath22 .",
    "the mosaic corners were only sampled once , other positions along the edge were sampled twice , and positions more than @xmath27 from the edge of the mosaic were sampled four times , resulting in a nominal total exposure time over most of the field of 60 s , 40 s and 60 s in @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively .",
    "figure 1 shows a @xmath30 mosaic of the entire survey region produced from our data .    the images , which were taken using double correlated sampling ,",
    "were linearized using an empirical correction developed for each pixel , and then flat fielded",
    ". a @xmath31 grid of observations of m67 was used to determine the type of flat field exposure which minimized the photometric dispersion in measurements of the same stars at many locations across the array . for @xmath21 and @xmath22",
    "median sky flats worked best , while for @xmath23 an average of dome flats with ambient illumination ( i.e. lights off ) minimized the dispersion , which was @xmath32 for all three bands .",
    "next the dimsum package within iraf was used to carry out sky subtraction and masking of bad pixels and cosmic ray hits . for each frame , dimsum calculates a median sky frame from preceding and following frames , masking pixels associated with detectable objects . in the @xmath21 band",
    "a median of 10 surrounding frames while rejecting the 2 highest and 2 lowest values at each pixel was found to produce the most uniform appearance across the final mosaicked image . for @xmath22 a median of 14 frames with rejection of the 3 highest and",
    "3 lowest pixels worked best . for @xmath23",
    "an 8 frame median and rejecting 2 high and 2 low pixels was used for the top and bottom third of the mosaic .",
    "because of the large extent of the two dominant central galaxies ( ngc 4874 and 4889 ) , in the center three rows of the mosaic dimsum tended to oversubtract the sky , and using a median which rejected a larger number of frames substantially alleviated this problem .",
    "nevertheless the extended emission near these two galaxies has probably been suppressed to some extent .",
    "registration of each sky - subtracted frame to the nearest half pixel was accomplished using offsets measured from objects which overlapped with those in frames to the south or east .",
    "the resulting three ir mosaics were registered to one another and rebinned to a common pixel size of @xmath33 using astrometry for 78 _ hst _ guide star catalog objects within the field . in the process",
    "the pixel scale for irim on the kpno 2.1  m was determined to be 1.0996 , 1.0964 , and 1.0922 @xmath34 arcseconds per pixel in @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively",
    ".    multiple observations of five ukirt standards transformed to the cit system @xcite , established that the ir data were photometric , and that the extinction coefficients were 0.17 , 0.07 , and 0.09 magnitudes per airmass in @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively .",
    "the coma mosaic data were all obtained at airmass @xmath35 .",
    "comparison with the infrared photometry of persson , frogel & aaronson ( 1979 ) ( see below ) showed no convincing evidence for a color term , but did reveal the need for a correction of @xmath36 for light lost in the small ( @xmath37 diameter ) apertures used in measuring the relatively faint ukirt standard stars .",
    "this aperture correction was determined empirically from an average of over 50 brighter stars in the standard star images .",
    "the zeropoints are judged to be accurate to @xmath38 magnitudes .",
    "optical data were obtained during service observations by george jacoby at the kpno 0.9  m telescope on 15 and 16 march 1994 using a 2048@xmath39 ccd with @xmath40 pixels .",
    "exposures in @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 were obtained in two positions to cover the infrared mosaic , whereas three positions were used for @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",

    "the @xmath45 band images from kitt peak were calibrated by matching photometry in large apertures on galaxies whose @xmath45 photometry was published by @xcite .",

    "we used focas @xcite on the @xmath21 and @xmath22 images to produce two independent catalogs .",
    "the detection limit was chosen to be 3.5@xmath51 above the sky level in an area equal to the psf disk .",
    "the two catalogs were position matched to eliminate false detections .",
    "only objects present in both catalogs were accepted in the final catalog ( under the assumption that coma galaxies have similar infrared colors so that the @xmath21 and @xmath22 images reach similar depths ) .",
    "astrometry for catalogued objects was determined using bright galaxies to establish an initial solution using the iraf task ccmap .",
    "this solution was then used to identify @xmath52 objects in the catalog with @xmath53 which were classified as stars by @xcite .",
    "these stars were then used to determine the final astrometric solution , which had residual errors of 0.4 arcsec .",
    "catalogued objects were identified with objects in existing catalogs if their positions agreed to within 3 arcseconds , using ned and @xcite    the angular size of galaxies in the catalog varies widely , requiring the use of an adaptive aperture size for photometry .",
    "simple single aperture photometry would introduce excessive noise for faint objects if the aperture used is too large , or omit substantial light from larger galaxies in the opposite case .",
    "an additional problem is deciding which light should be associated with which galaxy , particularly in the central regions where galaxies are clearly overlapping .",

    "similarly , for the iiia - j emulsion and ug-2 filter used by @xcite in the @xmath45 , we predict a difference of 0.188 magnitudes , which compares well with the 0.156 magnitudes found . applying these corrections ,",
    "our data lie within a few percent of all previous photometry .",
    "when we compare with @xcite we also find a difference of 0.08 magnitudes in the @xmath42 band : however , the different photometric methods employed ( isophotal apertures vs. circular ones ) are at least as important as differences in filter bandpasses and detectors .    to facilitate comparisons to our photometry",
    ", we provide the response functions for our bands in tables 13 through 21 , including the effects of filter and atmospheric transmission , and quantum efficiency .",
    "as an example application of this dataset we study the color - magnitude relation of early - type ( e or s0 ) galaxies and its intrinsic scatter , for the 8 colors shown in table 9 , using the 111 galaxies brighter than @xmath77 where we have a complete sample of cluster members .",
    "morphologies for these galaxies are taken from the compilation of @xcite or @xcite in order of preference",
    ". only 7 of these 111 galaxies do not have a morphological classification from these sources and we accordingly do not use them for computation of color - magnitude relations and scatter .",
    "@xcite has suggested that the actual slope of the color magnitude relation is much flatter than measured here ( and elsewhere ) and that this is due to the use of a fixed aperture for all galaxies rather than an adaptive aperture based on the structural parameters of each galaxy ( e.g. , using the half - light radius ) . because galaxies have internal color gradients , a fixed aperture samples more metal poor populations for the fainter galaxies , thus steepening the color - magnitude trend ( which is largely a mass - metallicity trend ",
    "@xcite ) .    to examine the effect of color gradients within galaxies on the derived cmr s , we measured and fit the @xmath6 vs.  @xmath42 cmr using a series of fixed circular apertures with radii ranging from @xmath78 to @xmath79 .",
    "we also used apertures with radii @xmath54 and @xmath80 where @xmath54 is the first moment of the light profile @xcite and is calculated for each galaxy .",
    "the @xmath54 and @xmath81 apertures should not be affected by the @xmath50 fwhm seeing , as they are generally considerably larger .",
    "the intercept of the cmr is redder for smaller apertures , as expected given the general sense of color gradients that are observed within elliptical galaxies .",
    "the slope , however , changes only slightly with aperture size , from @xmath760.128 for the smallest aperture to @xmath760.085 for @xmath82 .",
    "by contrast @xcite finds an essentially flat relation when measured within @xmath83 in @xmath6 vs @xmath42 .",
    "however , our findings are consistent with the mild color gradients observed for e / s0 galaxies in nearby clusters by @xcite .",
    "although it is important to remember that any derived cmr does depend on the apertures used for the photometry , particularly in its intercept , our basic results concerning the slope and scatter of the cmr are insensitive to the aperture size used , and we therefore restrict our attention to the fixed @xmath70 radius apertures for the remainder of this paper .",
    "figure 3 shows the color - magnitude relations and best linear regression fits for the colors listed in table 9 , vs total @xmath22 band magnitude .",
    "( for reference , @xmath84 in the @xmath22 band is 11.13 @xcite ) . in figure 4",
    "we show one of these color - magnitude relations using different symbols for members and non - members ( the plots in figure 3 are too compressed to show these clearly ) .",
    "the slope and intercepts of these fits are shown in table 12 .",
    "the intrinsic scatter , also tabulated in table 12 , is calculated using the bootstrap method of @xcite .",
    "one can see that the slope flattens for colors redder than @xmath42 and that the intrinsic scatter is approximately constant for colors which are equally spaced in ( logarithmic ) wavelength , suggesting that the relation is indeed driven primarily by metal abundance and that the majority of the stellar populations were formed at early epochs ( this is due to the fact that for old stellar populations the only age and metallicity sensitive index lies in the region of the 4000   break and the magnesium complex ",
    "see @xcite ) .",
    "it is also interesting to calculate how the intrinsic scatter varies with galaxy @xmath22 band luminosity ( i.e. , stellar mass ) : figure 5 shows the variation of the intrinsic scatter in 0.5 mag .",
    "bins for four colors .",
    "we see no evidence that the intrinsic scatter varies with galaxy luminosity ( this may also be appreciated from figure 3 , where the cmr does not appear to spread at faint luminosities ) .",
    "the existence of a color - magnitude relation is ascribed to a relation between galaxy mass and metallicity , which is suitably explained by models of monolithic collapse followed by fast winds .",
    "the small scatter about the relation implies that most of the stellar populations must be quite old and that the timescale for galaxy formation is relatively short , while few mergers may have occurred since early epochs @xcite .",
    "our observations confirm the small scatter seen by bower , but also show that the small scatter extends to fainter ellipticals ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "this suggests that the stellar populations of all cluster early - type galaxies , irrespective of mass , may have formed rapidly and at high redshift , and that the color - magnitude relation was formed at an early epoch .",
    "indeed , a mature relation is already observed in the @xmath86 cluster ms1054 - 0321 @xcite .",
    "a similar conclusion was also reached by @xcite on the basis of their thin color - magnitude relation in abell 1185 .",
    "the fact that the intrinsic scatter of the cmr is small for both bright and faint galaxies implies that all red sequence galaxies , irrespective of mass , have undergone a rapid star formation history , in contrast with evidence for ` downsizing ' among the faint field ( and high redshift ) galaxy population @xcite or for a truncated sequence at higher redshifts @xcite .",
