    "the effect on confinement on simple fluids has been vastly investigated in the past .",
    "most of studies are related to the effect of the confinement on the vapor - liquid transition , the so - called capillary transition . in the case of symmetric walls , where both walls attract or repel the molecules with the same strength ,",
    "the capillary transition in large pores is governed by the well - known kelvin law @xcite .",
    "in addition , it may appear surface phenomenology that can affect the global phase diagram . often this surface phenomenology is related to wetting states found in the single wall cases .",
    "the latter phenomenon is related to the spreading of drops of vapor ( liquid ) on the surface in coexistence with the bulk liquid ( vapor ) .",
    "the presence of these surface states can be considered in the description of the phase behavior in the confined system .",
    "the generalized kelvin law for small pores ( where surface phenomenology is more dominant ) takes into account these effects so it is still possible to determine the vapor - liquid transition for small pores @xcite .",
    "however , the predictions of the generalized kelvin law reveal that the wetting phenomena does not affect essentially the phase diagram of the confined problem so they are often discarded .",
    "an interesting system is the _ hybrid _ cell ( also known as asymmetric cell ) where one substrate or wall is repulsive and the other attractive ( competing walls ) . in this case",
    ", the wetting properties present in the single wall cases play a crucial role in the determination of the critical point in the confined problem . here , given a pore width , the coexistence of two phases can only occur for temperatures below @xmath0 , which corresponds to the total wetting temperature of the single wall cases @xcite .",
    "these studies have elucidated which mechanisms are involved in the surface transitions and how the properties of the substrate can determine the phase behavior within the pore . with respect to complex fluids like liquid crystal ( lc )",
    "there is an increasing interest in the understanding of the surface phenomena due to its crucial role in the advance of the lc technology . for the case of a single wall ( semi - infinite problem ) and symmetric pores favoring an specific orientation on the molecules , theoretical approaches @xcite as well as computer simulations @xcite reveal that the interaction wall - fluid particle can affect strongly the ordering not only close to the surface but also far from it .",
    "additionally to finite size effects , novel phenomena often appear due to the combined presence of anchoring and orientational wetting transitions .",
    "the interplay between both surface phenomena and its dependence on wall properties have been recently studied by us employing a microscopic density functional theory ( dft ) approach for a simple model of liquid crystal @xcite .",
    "the effect of confinement by symmetric walls on these surface transitions was also studied @xcite .",
    "our findings revealed that as in the case of simple fluids , the finite - size effects for not very narrow pores on the phase diagram are not of qualitative significant importance and only the location of the capillary transitions are affected by the confinement .",
    "however , recent theoretical @xcite and simulation results @xcite for hard - spherocylinder models show that for very narrow symmetrical pores the ni capillary transition may end up in a critical point .    in a recent paper @xcite",
    ", we extended the study to the case with an hybrid cell where the surfaces favor antagonist orientations .",
    "this geometry has in lcs a particular interest due to the possible technological applications .",
    "this fact has stimulated an increasing interest by experimentalists and theoreticians @xcite .",
    "in particular , different nematic - like states with homogeneous and linearly distorted director fields were found to coexist under confinement . in the present paper ,",
    "our goal is to complete this study with the investigation of the nematic - isotropic ( ni ) transition within the hybrid cell .",
    "et al _ investigated a similar problem employing a landau - type theory @xcite .",
    "they claimed that the ni transition either appears unaffected and its temperature @xmath1 remains unchanged or the transition disappears .",
    "basically what determined the existence of the transition was the value of fluid - wall interaction strength with respect to the value for the first - order wetting transition for the semi - infinite systems . for strength values below this threshold",
    "the transition occurs for all wall separations .",
    "in contrast , above the threshold , the transition disappears for large pore widths , where interfacial - like states appear .",
    "these states are related to the wetting states by isotropic and nematic phase that each wall present in the semi - infinite geometry , respectively .    in this paper",
    "we address the same problem of the behavior of the ni capillary transition and its possible disappearance from a more microscopic point of view by using a dft approach .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we briefly present our liquid crystal model in section ii . in section iii",
    "we revisit and complete the study of a substrate which favors either planar or homeotropic anchoring in contact with a nematogen fluid at its isotropic or nematic phase .",
    "in particular , the different wetting regimes are found .",
    "this phenomenology will be a crucial guide to understand the behavior of the fluid under confinement .",
    "section iv is devoted to the study of the fluid adsorbed in a hybrid cell , paying special attention to the disappearance of the ni capillary transitions and the mechanisms involved in it .",
    "finally we end up with our conclusions .",
    "the theoretical model is a standard generalized van der waals theory based on a perturbative expansion , using a hard - sphere ( hs ) fluid as reference system @xcite .",

    "anisotropy _ in the orientational configuration of the nematic molecules is essential to understand the phenomenology in the problem with the walls .",
    "the walls are modelled via the following potentials : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the angle between the molecule axis and the @xmath32-axis normal to the substrate . for @xmath33 ,",
    "this potential favors the molecules to align perpendicularly to the surface ( homeotropic anchoring ) .",
    "the potential corresponding to the other substrate is : @xmath34 which favors the molecules to align in a plane parallel to the surface for @xmath35 .",
    "however , this preferred alignment corresponds to a random planar anchoring , since there is not a preferred direction at the @xmath36 orientation plane .",
    "the parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 measure the substrate - fluid interaction strength of each substrate .    in our study",
    ", we will assume that the nematic director orientation is embedded in the @xmath39 plane .",
    "the formalism permits to define the orientation distribution of the molecules referred to a laboratory reference system , described by three order parameters , @xmath40 the order also can be referred to an intrinsic reference system by three quantities : @xmath41 the _ tilt _ angle defined like the angle formed by the director with the @xmath32 axis , @xmath42 ( uniaxial order parameter ) the amount of order along the director and @xmath43 ( biaxial order parameter ) which measures the amount of order along the perpendicular directions of the director .",
    "the nematic ordering is essentially uniaxial ( @xmath44 ) far from the substrate .",

    "numerical values for the potential parameters were taken as @xmath50 ( which sets the temperature scale ) , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the range parameters @xmath53 are set , in units of @xmath28 ( throughout we choose this unit to set the length scale ) , to @xmath54 , @xmath55 respectively , and @xmath56 . in our calculations the temperature is fixed at the value @xmath57 , that corresponds to a typical situation in which vapor , isotropic and nematic phases can be observed . at this temperature ,",
    "the isotropic - nematic coexistence occurs for a reduced chemical potential @xmath58 .",
    "in order to better understanding the behavior of the fluid inside the pore , we have first considered the semi - infinite cases of the fluid in presence of a single substrate that either favors homeotropic or planar alignment , i.e. the substrate - fluid interaction potentials are given by eq .",
    "( [ homeotropic ] ) with @xmath33 or @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "we are interested in the wetting behavior , so the system will be at bulk nematic - isotropic coexistence , unless stated otherwise .",
    "we have considered both situations in which the bulk fluid is either isotropic or nematic .",
    "first we consider the case of a nematic bulk phase in presence of the substrate .",
    "this situation was studied for substrates that favor homeotropic anchoring in ref . .",
    "we extend this analysis to substrates which favor planar alignment . for both negative and small positive values of @xmath37",
    "the fluid far from the substrate orientates parallel to the substrate . for the case in which @xmath59 , biaxiality is developed in a microscopic layer close to the substrate , leading to the decay of the orientational order in that area .",
    "if the substrate favors a homeotropic alignment , we observe a microscopic isotropic - like layer close to the substrate , corresponding to a partial wetting situation of the substrate - nematic interface by the isotropic phase .",
    "as @xmath37 is increased , the isotropic layer close to the substrate becomes macroscopic as the isotropic phase completely wets the nematic - substrate interface at @xmath60 .",
    "our calculations showed that the wetting transition is continuous .",
    "the orientation far from the substrate remains planar in the complete wetting case . by further increasing @xmath37 ,",
    "an anchoring transition occurs for @xmath61 , as the nematic orientation changes from planar to homeotropic far from the substrate , and the wetting becomes partial again since the isotropic - nematic interface favors a planar anchoring in our model .",
    "the anchoring transition is first order and continues in the single nematic phase region .",
    "however , the complete wetting with planar orientation state remains metastable up to @xmath62 .",
    "this fact will be important for the discussion of the confined cases .",
    "for the model parameters considered in this paper , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "we turn to the case in which there is an isotropic phase in bulk . for small values of @xmath66 , the inhomogeneities of the density and order parameter profiles are restricted to a microscopic layer close to the substrate .",
    "although the fluid is isotropic far from the substrate , the anisotropic character of the substrate - fluid potential induces a random planar ordering near the substrate , i.e. the particles orientate parallel to the substrate but without any preferred direction in that orientation plane ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 ) .",
    "such a condition can be seen as an extreme biaxial case , where @xmath69 , i.e. the highest eigenvalue of the orientational order parameter tensor is twofold degenerate .",
    "the layer width remains microscopically finite as the ni coexistence is approached , corresponding to a partial wetting situation . for large enough values of @xmath66",
    ", we observe complete wetting situations . for negative values of @xmath37 and at the ni coexistence , there is a sudden change at @xmath70 from the previous surface state to a complete wetting state of the isotropic - substrate interface by the nematic phase .",
    "this corresponds to a first order wetting transition . for our model parameters , @xmath71 .",
    "due to its first order character , there is a prewetting first - order transition for @xmath72 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . at this transition the particles at the first layer orientates along some direction parallel to the substrate , breaking the rotational symmetry of the state ( see insets of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for the order parameter profiles ) .",
    "consequently , the prewetting transition can be seen as a two - dimensional isotropic to nematic transition at the fluid layer close to the substrate .",
    "we will denote @xmath73 and @xmath74 to the surface states with the random planar and nematic layer close to the wall , respectively . for the @xmath74 state",
    ", there is also biaxiality near the substrate , as occurred when there was a nematic fluid in bulk .",
    "a similar behavior was found for the zwanzig model and hard spherocylinder fluids @xcite , although their `` prewetting '' transition is continuous ( second order for the zwanzig model and it is expected to be kosterlitz - thouless - like for the spherocylinder system ) . the prewetting surface nematization transition shifts towards lower chemical potentials as @xmath75 is increased , and eventually disappears at a critical point . for large positive values of @xmath37 , i.e. @xmath76 , we also found that the nematic phase completely wets the isotropic - substrate interface .",
    "we have checked indirectly this by studying the numerically obtained profiles that minimize our free energy functional .",
    "the order parameter profiles that we obtain in our numerical minimization are inhomogeneous along the wetting layer ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this fact is due to the mismatch of anchoring conditions at the interfaces .",
    "we first note that the _ intrinsic _ order parameters are homogeneous along the wetting layer except close to the interfaces ( see inset in fig . [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "so the origin of the inhomogeneity of the _ extrinsic _ order parameters is the change of the orientation of the nematic director field along the wetting layer .",
    "as previously mentioned , the molecules align parallel to the interface between a nematic and isotropic phase . on the other hand , the molecules anchor homeotropically close to the substrate due to the strong anchoring coupling between the substrate and the fluid . as the nematic layer width diverges",
    ", it is possible to fulfill both anchoring conditions by slowly varying the nematic director from homeotropic to planar anchoring .",
    "however , any numerical calculation requires minimization in a finite range @xmath77 for the @xmath32 coordinate , imposing bulk isotropic conditions for @xmath78 .",
    "in this situation , the nematic director profile that corresponds to the minimum of the grand - canonical free energy is expected to be linear , as it is indeed observed by numerical minimization ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this fact induces a @xmath79 dependence of the apparent equilibrium excess grand - canonical free energy ( or surface tension @xmath80 ) due to the elastic deformation .",
    "such decay is much slower than the usual exponential correction when elastic deformations are not involved , and we have to consider much larger values of @xmath77 to obtain reliable values of the true equilibrium free energies . as @xmath77 increases , the apparent surface tension decreases and it is always larger than the complete wetting state excess free energy , that it is the sum of the surface tension @xmath81 corresponding to the interface between substrate and a nematic phase oriented homeotropically far away , and the surface tension @xmath82 between corresponding to the nematic - isotropic interface where the nematic phase is planar - anchored with respect to the interface .",
    "the latter surface tension is independent of the fluid - substrate interactions , and its value is @xmath83 for the ni coexistence at @xmath84 . fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] summarizes the results of this section .",
    "we represent the cosine of the contact angle @xmath31 of a droplet of isotropic phase in coexistence with bulk the nematic phase on a planar substrate as a function of @xmath75 .",
    "the young equation states that : @xmath85 where @xmath81 , @xmath86 and @xmath82 are the surface tensions corresponding to the substrate - nematic , substrate - isotropic and nematic - isotropic interfaces , respectively . for @xmath87 ( including negative values ) , the nematic director is parallel to the substrate far from the substrate .",
    "otherwise , the nematic director is homeotropically anchored .",
    "the complete wetting region corresponds to @xmath88 .",
    "the curve meets the @xmath89 line at @xmath90 with no change in slope .",
    "this fact is a signature of the second - order character of the wetting transition . on the contrary",
    ", the curve departs from the @xmath89 line at @xmath91 with non - zero slope , indicating the first - order character of the dewetting transition .",
    "[ fig3 ] also gives information about the wetting properties when there is an isotropic phase in bulk . by reversing the roles of the nematic and isotropic phases in eq .",
    "( [ young ] ) , it is straightforward to see that the contact angle @xmath92 of a nematic droplet on a planar substrate is related to @xmath31 via @xmath93 . consequently , when @xmath94 we observe complete wetting by nematic phase of the isotropic - substrate interface .",
    "this fact is clear for @xmath95 .",
    "however , for @xmath96 the apparent values of @xmath97 are less than @xmath98 .",
    "as previously discussed , this is a finite - size effect of our numerical calculations and the predicted value is @xmath94 . nevertheless , since the nematic layer remains finite as @xmath99 from below , the localization of the wetting transition is quite accurate . for both wetting transitions at @xmath100 and @xmath101 there is a change of slope of the @xmath97 curve , that it is in agreement with their first - order character .",
    "we turn to the case of the fluid confined in a hybrid slit pore , where each substrate favors an antagonist anchoring , i.e. homeotropic and planar , respectively . under confinement",
    ", it is well known that the bulk transitions have lower - dimensional counterparts that are known as capillary transitions .",
    "the thermodynamic conditions ( temperature , pressure , chemical potential ) for such transitions are usually shifted with respect to the bulk coexistence values . before considering our dft results , we consider the predictions of the kelvin equation , which gives the leading order for the shift on chemical potential @xmath102 of the capillary nematic - isotropic transition @xmath103 with respect to the bulk value @xmath104 at large pore widths @xmath12 .",
    "thermodynamic considerations @xcite show that the chemical potential shift @xmath105 of a capillary transition with respect to the bulk one between the @xmath106 and @xmath107 phases at a given temperature obeys asymptotically : @xmath108 in this expression , @xmath109 is the surface tension for an @xmath110 interface , and @xmath111 and @xmath112 are the bulk densities of the @xmath106 and @xmath107 phases , respectively .",
    "finally , @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the contact angles corresponding to the droplets of @xmath106 phase that nucleate on each substrate when the fluid is in bulk in the @xmath107 phase , respectively . in our case",
    ", we can identify @xmath106 as the isotropic phase and @xmath107 as the nematic phase .",
    "it is implicitely assumed in eq .",
    "( [ kelvin ] ) that there is a partial wetting situation for both substrates in semi - infinite geometries .",
    "however , if either there is complete wetting only at one substrate or in both but by the same phase ( @xmath115 or @xmath116 ) , the effective pore width in eq .",
    "( [ kelvin ] ) is reduced to @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is a constant that depends on the range of the wall - fluid interactions and @xmath119 is the sum of the widths of the adsorbed wetting layers .",
    "nevertheless , this modification does not change qualitatively the results .",
    "its only effect is to observe the behavior predicted by the kelvin equation at larger values of the pore width @xmath12 than for a partial wetting situation .",
    "a different situation arises when both substrates are completely wet by _ different _ phases at coexistence , i.e. @xmath120 . studies for symmetrically opposing surface fields ising systems @xcite and landau - de gennes models of liquid crystals @xcite show that in this situation there is _ no _ capillary transition",
    ". instead , an interface - like state appears , where half the pore is filled with an @xmath106-like layer , and the rest by @xmath107-like phase .",
    "the position of the interface between both layers is controlled by the deviation of chemical potential with respect to the coexistence value , being possible to go from an @xmath106-like capillary pure phase to a @xmath107-like one without undergoing any phase transition .",
    "the phase transition is only recovered in the bulk limit @xmath121 .",
    "when the opposing surface fields are not symmetrical ( at least for near - symmetrical ) , it is expected to observe a similar behavior @xcite .",
    "this analysis allows us to envisage different scenarios for the confined case and large @xmath12 . for simplicity",
    ", we will only consider the case @xmath122 in eqs .",
    "( [ homeotropic ] ) and ( [ planar ] ) .",
    "we must note that this choice _ does not _ correspond to the symmetrical opposing fields , since the effect of each substrate is qualitatively different . for large",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath123 and @xmath124 we expect to have a nematic - isotropic capillary transition .",
    "the transition point will shifted towards lower or higher chemical potentials than the corresponding to the bulk transition if @xmath125 is negative or positive , respectively .",
    "this state - dependent capillary transition shift , which does not occur for simple fluids , has been observed in our model under confinement between symmetrical substrates that favor homeotropic anchoring @xcite , and also in confined spherocylinder model with the onsager approximation for a symmetrical slit pore @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath126 , no capillary transition is expected to be obtained for _ any _ pore width .",
    "we present now our dft calculations . for the sake of clarity",
    ", we separate the results obtained for @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "we performed our first dft calculations for @xmath129 , which correspond to partial wetting situation in the semi - infinite geometry for both substrates .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows the behavior of the averaged intrinsic order parameter @xmath130 as the chemical potential is varied .",

    "examination of the order parameter profiles show that the director field in the nematic - like state is oriented parallel throughout the pore to the substrate with an intrinsic order parameter similar to the bulk value , except in thin layers around the substrates , where the density and order parameter profiles are similar to the ones corresponding to the semi - infinite cases .",
    "in particular a very thin layer close to the @xmath10 substrate is homeotropically anchored .",
    "this state corresponds to the @xmath131 state in ref . and we will denote it by @xmath132 . on the other hand ,",
    "the isotropic - like state ( which we will denote as @xmath73 ) develops microscopic homeotropically and random - planar layers close to the @xmath10 and @xmath11 substrates , respectively , and the orientational ordering decays to zero in the middle region of the pore .",
    "we have also compared our dft calculations with the kelvin law prediction eq .",
    "( [ kelvin ] ) ( see inset in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "although the transition value departs from this prediction for small pore widths , for @xmath133 the agreement between our numerical estimations and the kelvin predicted value is quite reasonable .",
    "note that the capillary ni transition is shifted to larger chemical potentials than the bulk ni transition value .",
    "however , as @xmath75 increases , this trend is reversed ( the kelvin law predicts the turning point to occur at @xmath134 ) .",
    "as @xmath75 exceeds @xmath100 , wetting in the @xmath11 wall begins to affect the pore adsorption . for small values of @xmath12",
    "a single transition between an isotropic - like @xmath73 state to a nematic - like state occurs as for @xmath72 .",
    "however , as @xmath12 increases the order of the `` nematic - like '' state decreases and the chemical potential for which this transition occurs converges to the @xmath135 transition value for the @xmath11 wall .",
    "the order - parameter profiles make clear that the `` nematic - like '' state corresponds to the formation of a nematic layer close to the @xmath11 substrate followed by an isotropic ordering along the pore . by analogy with the semi - infinite situation ,",
    "we call @xmath74 to the confined state after this transition , which we can see as a reminiscence of the @xmath135 transition in the semi - infinite phenomenology . as @xmath12 increases , in addition to the @xmath135 transition , a new phase transition between the @xmath74 to a proper nematic - like state @xmath132 ( i.e. planar - anchored along the pore ) is observed .",
    "this transition can be regarded as the true capillary ni transition .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows our dft calculations for @xmath136 and different values of @xmath75 .",
    "it becomes clear that the difference between the @xmath74 and the @xmath132 states at the transition decreases as @xmath75 increases , and eventually the ni capillary transition disappears in a critical point ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath75 at which the ni capillary transition disappears is _ lower _ than @xmath137 , i.e. the confinement _ distabilizes _ the two - phase region with respect to the one - phase region .",

    "we set @xmath138 , slightly below @xmath137 .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows that the capillary ni transition does not exist for the smallest values of @xmath12 and reappears for @xmath139 .",
    "the disappearance of the ni capillar transition shown by our model is not related to the critical points observed for _ small _ values of @xmath12 in other models @xcite .",
    "actually , those cases correspond to symmetrical slit - pores and consequently their phenomenology is not related to wetting properties of the substrates . in our model",
    "the ni capillary transition occurs at least for @xmath140 when the substrates at @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the same @xcite .",
    "however we can not rule out the possibility of critical points for very small @xmath12 , but we will not consider them since the predictions of our model are not reliable in that regime .",
    "our dft results about the existence of the ni capillary transition show the opposite trend to the one predicted by a landau - de gennes model in ref . , which predicted that the confinement _ stabilized _ the two - phase region with respect to the one - phase region .",
    "moreover for large values of @xmath12 the boundary for the non - existence region of the capillary transition was a triple point rather than a critical point .",
    "actually the scenario shown by our dft calculations is consistent with the phenomenology that presents a confined ising model with opposing surface fields when the wetting transition is critical @xcite .",
    "this analogy can be explained heuristically . for large @xmath12 and @xmath75 close to @xmath137 , the typical configuration close to bulk coexistence corresponds to an interfacial state formed by an isotropic layer around the @xmath10 and a nematic layer around the @xmath11 wall . in first approximation",
    "the ni interface position is given by the minimum binding potential which is the superposition of the contributions from the two semi - infinite systems @xcite .",
    "as there is a complete wetting situation at the @xmath11 substrate , we can consider its binding potential as a exponentially decreasing function of the interfacial position with respect to the @xmath11 wall @xmath141 $ ] , where @xmath142 and @xmath143 is the nematic phase correlation length at bulk ni coexistence .",
    "note that the local minimum corresponding to the bounded state , if any , plays no role in our argument as soon as we are far enough from the first - order wetting transition corresponding to the semi - infinite case with the @xmath11 wall . on the other hand ,",
    "the binding potential corresponding to the @xmath10 substrate takes the usual form @xmath144 , where @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 is the isotropic phase correlation length at bulk ni coexistence .",
    "so , the complete binding potential for the ni interfase , up to irrelevant constants , is : @xmath148 where @xmath149 .",
    "a critical point must verify : @xmath150 instead of solving simultaneously eqs .",
    "( [ m1 ] ) and ( [ m2 ] ) , we will study the spinodal line , which is the solution of eq .",
    "( [ m2 ] ) .",
    "we consider solutions of the form @xmath151 , where @xmath152 and @xmath153 . substituting this ansatz in eq .",
    "( [ m2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath154 in order to have two solutions for the eq .",
    "( [ m2 - 2 ] ) , we need all the factors in brackets in eq .",
    "( [ m2 - 2 ] ) to be of the same order .",
    "consequently we obtain that @xmath155 and @xmath156 $ ] , where @xmath157 .",
    "the value of @xmath158 for which the critical point occurs corresponds to the case where the rescaled equation : @xmath159 has an unique real solution . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume that @xmath160 , but similar results are found when both correlation lengths are different .",
    "we refrain to give explicit solutions and we just mention that indeed @xmath161 and the value of @xmath162 at the critical point is @xmath163 for reasonable values of @xmath164 and @xmath165 . consequently , the interfacial position at the critical point @xmath166 and the ni capillary transition shift @xmath167 and from eq .",
    "( [ m1 ] ) @xmath168 .",
    "a numerical comparison of these predictions with our dft calculations , although it would be very interesting , is extremely difficult due to the limitations of our numerical procedure and it will not be carried out in this work . however , at least qualitatively these predictions have been confirmed by the dft calculations even for not so large values of @xmath12 .",
    "now we turn to study the confined system for @xmath128 .",
    "we first considered the case @xmath169 and @xmath136 .",
    "different confined states are obtained as the chemical potential increases ( see fig . [ fig7 ] ) . the first cases figs . [ fig7](a ) and [ fig7](b ) clearly correspond to a vapor - like and isotropic - like states , and we will denote them as @xmath170 and @xmath73 , respectively . there is in both cases a homeotropically - anchored nematic layer close to the substrate at @xmath10 and a random planar layer close to the substrate at @xmath11 . as the chemical potential increases , the random planar layer at @xmath11 undergoes a transition to a planar biaxial state .",
    "again this first - order transition is a reminiscence of the @xmath135 surface transition corresponding to the substrate at @xmath11 , and we will denote both confined states @xmath73 and @xmath74 by analogy with the semi - infinite phenomenology . as the chemical potential is further increased , the nematic layer increases and a state in which an isotropic and a nematic layer coexist is obtained ( fig . [",
    "fig7](c ) ) .",
    "there is no phase transition between the isotropic - like @xmath74 and the nematic - like @xmath132 states , but a smooth transformation similar to the expected one when both substrates are completely wet by different bulk phases at coexistence .",
    "finally , there is a transition to a new nematic - like state ( the _ l state _ in ref .",
    ", that we will denote as @xmath171 ) , characterized by an almost linear distorsion from homeotropic to planar configuration on the tilt angle through the pore , although the _ intrinsic _ order parameter takes essentially the bulk value except close to the substrates ( see fig .",
    "[ fig7](d ) ) .",
    "this transition between the @xmath171 and @xmath132 state is first order and converges to the anchoring transition that is observed in the semi - infinite case with a substrate that favors a homeotropic anchoring as @xmath172 @xcite .",
    "a more detailed discussion about this transition can be found in ref . .",
    "for larger values of @xmath12 , the capillary ni transition appears as a transition between an @xmath74 state and a @xmath171 state for chemical potentials smaller than the bulk ni transition value .",
    "as @xmath75 approaches @xmath173 , the range of values of @xmath12 for which capillary transition does not exist is wider . for @xmath174 ( close to the dewetting transition point ) the capillary ni transition does not appear until @xmath175 .",
    "[ fig8 ] shows the continuous change of the nematic layer as the chemical potential increases for @xmath136 , which is analogous to the behavior observed for @xmath169 .",
    "[ fig9 ] shows how the curves of the averaged intrinsic order parameter as a function of the chemical potential change for increasing pore widths . for the narrowest pore ( @xmath176 )",
    ", a single transition is observed between an isotropic state to an state with some nematic ordering .",
    "however , as @xmath12 is increased , it becomes clear that this transition is again a reminiscence of the @xmath135 transition in the semi - infinite case .",
    "the localization of this transition depends weakly on the pore width @xmath12 .",
    "for @xmath177 , the @xmath178 transition appears at chemical potentials larger than the bulk ni coexistence value .",
    "this transition does not appear for @xmath176 , which is a clear indication of the existence of a critical point for the @xmath178 transition at small values of @xmath12 .",
    "as @xmath12 increases , the chemical potential value for @xmath178 transition shifts to lower values . finally , we observe that the @xmath130 curve becomes increasingly steep at the bulk ni transition as @xmath172 .",
    "this fact is a consequence of the formation of interfacial - like states ( as fig . [ fig7](c ) ) in the proximities of the bulk ni coexistence chemical potential .",
    "the non - existence of a capillary ni transition in the situation described above is unexpected .",
    "first , the finite - width effects are much more pronounced for @xmath128 than below @xmath137 . as a consequence ,",
    "we observe significant departures from the bulk behavior for wider pores and in a larger range of @xmath75 than when we approach the complete wetting situation from below ( i.e. @xmath127 ) .",
    "this fact suggests the emergence of a new length scale in the system . on the other hand ,",
    "as the dewetting transition is first order , we could naively expect that under confinement and large enough @xmath12 the capillary transition disappearance point is shifted to _",
    "lower _ values of @xmath75 @xcite ( recall that the role of @xmath75 or the temperature is reversed in the dewetting transition with respect to the wetting transition ) .",
    "to understand this situation we recall that the confinement in a hybrid cell distabilizes the @xmath171 with respect to the @xmath132 .",
    "a simple phenomenological argument can be used to explain this fact @xcite . for large enough values of @xmath12 , the excess free - energy per surface area of a @xmath132 state",
    "is given by the sum of the surface free energies between each substrate and a nematic fluid which is planar - anchored with respect to them .",
    "the finite - width corrections are expected to decay exponentially . on the other hand , the large @xmath12 behavior free energy of the @xmath171 state",
    "is the sum of the surface tensions of the interface between the @xmath10 substrate and a homeotropically - anchored nematic fluid and the corresponding between the planar - anchored nematic fluid and the @xmath11 substrate . for this state",
    "the finite - width correction is dominated by the elastic deformations contribution and decays as @xmath179 as @xmath172 , where @xmath180 is a frank - oseen elastic constant @xcite .",
    "so , for a given temperature , the @xmath181 transition is always shifted towards higher chemical potentials than the anchoring transition , and the convergence to it for large values of @xmath12 is quite slow .",
    "although this argument implicitely assumes that the inhomogeneities are restricted to microscopic regions around each substrate , it is also valid if we allow the @xmath132 state to develop an isotropic layer close to the @xmath10 substrate ( as occurs close to the bulk ni coexistence ) .",
    "consequently , for @xmath182 and moderate values of @xmath12 , the most stable nematic - like state close to the bulk ni coexistence is @xmath132 , and therefore there is no capillary transition . as @xmath12 increases",
    ", the @xmath171 state becomes more stable than the @xmath132 state near the @xmath183 bulk transition , and eventually the capillary transition between a @xmath74 state and a @xmath171 occurs .",
    "an interesting feature of the ni capillary transition in this regime is that it is linked to the _ purely surface transition _ @xmath181 .",
    "as explained before , for small values of @xmath12 there is no ni capillary transition but if @xmath12 is not too small there is a @xmath181 transition . as @xmath12 increases , the chemical potential corresponding to the @xmath181 transition shifts to smaller values , and eventually crosses the value corresponding to the bulk ni transition ( see fig . [ fig10 ] ) .",
    "when this happens , the transition is between a isotropic - like @xmath74 state to the nematic - like @xmath171 state : the capillary ni transition is recovered . finally , the kelvin relationship eq .",
    "( [ kelvin ] ) predicts that the capillary transition value of @xmath184 approaches the bulk ni value from _ below_. the dft results for large @xmath12 support this prediction .",
    "so , at fixed temperature and chemical potential , and changing @xmath12 , reentrance of the isotropic - like state is observed ( see fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) .",
    "in this paper we have reported a dft study of the ni capillary transition under confinement in a slit - pore where each substrate favors a different anchoring condition .",
    "we found that there is an interplay between the phenomenology found in the semi - infinite problems with the phenomenology which appeared in the confined problem .",
    "we have focussed in the non - existence of the ni capillary transition as a result of both substrates to be wet by different phases .",
    "if we approach this region from below , we observe a distabilization of the two - phase region with respect to the one - phase region .",
    "moreover , the capillary ni transition finishes in a critical point .",
    "these findings are different from the ones reported by quintana _",
    "et al _ @xcite and this discrepancy can be traced to the different order of the wetting transition .",
    "when we approach the non - existence range for the ni capillary transition from above , a different mechanism is involved in the finite - size effects of the capillary ni transition .",
    "although the wetting transition which drives the disappearance of the capillary transition is first - order , the two - phase region is still distabilized with respect to the one - phase region .",
    "the explanation for this is the existence of two nematic - like locally stable phases with a relative stability dependent on the pore width .",
    "one of them corresponds to a complete wetting situation , so links with the isotropic - like states without undergoing a phase transition .",
    "so , as @xmath12 increases , the phase transition between two nematic - like states transforms continuously to the ni capillary transition . as a consequence , a reentrant behavior for the isotropic - like state",
    "is observed by varying the pore width and keeping the temperature and chemical potential constant .",
    "although we have restricted our study to an isotherm case , we anticipate that we would find a similar behavior if the temperature is changed instead of the value of @xmath75 . on the other hand ,",
    "the condition @xmath185 is not so restrictive as soon as the wetting transition of the @xmath11 wall precedes the complete wetting at the @xmath10 wall .",
    "if such a condition is not fulfilled , our conclusions may change .",
