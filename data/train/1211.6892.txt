    "during the formation and assembly of massive galaxies merging is a natural process in modern hierarchical cosmological models .",
    "it is expected to play a significant role for the structural and morphological evolution ( e.g. @xcite ) . in the light of these theoretical expectations and direct observations of dry mergers of gas",
    "poor elliptical galaxies up to high redshift @xcite simulations of idealized collisionless mergers have again received attention and new studies were triggered .",
    "merger simulations of already existing spheroidal galaxies have focused in detail on the evolution of abundance gradients , shapes and kinematics , scaling relations , sizes and dark matter fractions . if the progenitors were two disk galaxies ( which then can include a gaseous component ) the aim was to investigate the morphological transformation , i.e. the formation of new dynamically hot spheroidal elliptical galaxies from two dynamically cold progenitor spiral galaxies .",
    "apart from studies of the effect of the merger mass - ratio the tidal torquing of gas , its inflow to the central regions , the impact on the stellar orbits @xcite , subsequent starbursts and the potential growth of black holes @xcite was investigated in numerous studies together with influential studies on the origin of early - type galaxy scaling relations @xcite . however , despite the detailed insights on the stellar and gas dynamical processes in simulated galaxy mergers , the binary merger approach is limited in scope and seems not to be able to naturally explain all properties of present day massive elliptical galaxies @xcite .    the most massive elliptical galaxies ( or their progenitors ) are considered to start forming their stars at high redshift ( @xmath0 , or higher ) in a dissipative environment , rapidly become very massive ( @xmath1 ) by @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "a significant fraction of this high redshift population is observed to be already quiescent at @xmath3 , on average 4 - 5 times more compact ( part of this apparent evolution might driven by selection effects , see e.g. @xcite ) , and typically a factor of two less massive than their low redshift descendants .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the high - redshift population forms the cores of at least some , if not all , present day massive ellipticals .",
    "this rapid structural evolution is supposed to happen in an inside - out fashion , mainly by adding stellar mass to the outer parts of the galaxies over time , however , without the formation of a significant fraction of new stars @xcite . in this respect",
    "the growth of massive quiescent high - redshift galaxies is markedly different to the star formation driven inside - out growth of disk galaxies    the implications of these observational findings for the formation and evolution of massive elliptical galaxies are many - fold .",
    "they are unlikely to have formed by an initial monolithic collapse followed by passive evolution as their present day counterparts would be too small and too red @xcite .",
    "in addition the evolution of these system can not be explained by just a single binary merger of disk galaxies. the compact high - redshift systems might have formed in such a process @xcite , if it were gas - rich , but the subsequent structural evolution requires additional processes which are not driven by the formation of new stars .",
    "observational results that almost none of these massive compact galaxies were able to survive to the present day @xcite indicate that a general and common physical mechanism must be at work .",
    "spectacular events alone , like major early - type galaxy mergers , might be too rare .",
    "minor merges , however , are expected to happen frequently in the lifetime of a massive galaxy and have received particular attention as they provide a natural way to increase the size of a galaxy . with only a few assumptions the virial theorem provides a simple estimate of how a one - component system evolves during major and minor mergers @xcite .",
    "following @xcite we assume that a compact initial stellar system has formed ( e.g. involving gas dissipation ) with a total energy @xmath4 , a mass @xmath5 , a gravitational radius @xmath6 , and the mean square speed of the stars is @xmath7 . according to the virial theorem @xcite",
    "the total energy of the system is    @xmath8    this system then merges ( on zero energy orbits ) with other systems of a total energy @xmath9 , total mass @xmath10 , gravitational radii @xmath11 and mean square speeds averaging @xmath12 .",
    "the fractional mass increase from all the merged galaxies is @xmath13 and the total kinetic energy of the material is @xmath14 , further defining @xmath15 . under the assumption of energy conservation ( results from",
    "indicate that most halos merge on parabolic orbits ) the ratio of initial to final mean square speeds , gravitational radii and densities can be then written as @xcite    @xmath16    for mergers of two identical systems , @xmath17 , the mean square speed would remain unchanged , the size increases by a factor of two and the densities drop by a factor of four . in the limit that the mass is accreted in the form of very weakly bound stellar systems with @xmath18 or @xmath19 , the mean square speed is reduced by a factor two , the size increases by a factor four and the density drops by a factor of 32 .",
    "these estimates are , however , idealized assuming one - component systems , no violent relaxation and zero - energy orbits with fixed angular momentum .    ,",
    "title=\"fig:\",width=249 ] , title=\"fig:\",width=249 ]    @xcite have recently re - investigated in detail the collisionless dynamics of major and minor mergers of systems including concentrated stellar spheroidal components embedded in extended dark matter halos .",
    "they present more accurate versions of the above equations including the effect of escapers and the interaction of the stellar baryonic with dark matter and describe in detail how the presence of a massive dark matter halos alter the evolution of the merging systems .",
    "one result of this study was that both minor and major mergers lead to size growth and an increase of the dark matter fraction .",
    "the physical processes are , however , different .",
    "violent relaxation in major mergers mixes dark matter to the central regions .",
    "escaping , unbound , particles limit the expected size growth to values below the ones expected from the idealized equations above . in minor mergers ( mass - ratios of 1:5 and 1:10 ) ,",
    "the stellar satellites are stripped at large radii where the host galaxies dominated by dark matter and the stellar effective radii and the dark matter fractions grow more rapidly than expected from the simple virial equations ( see also @xcite ) . due to the addition of stellar satellite material at large radii @xcite , the stellar mass distribution changes significantly resulting in a significant increase of the sersic index ( see fig . [ fig1 ] and @xcite ) .",
    "the general results on size evolution are in agreement with similar studies by e.g. @xcite .",
    "however , there is an ongoing debate of whether the size growth by minor mergers is sufficient to explain the observed cosmological size evolution of elliptical galaxies .",
    "whereas @xcite argue that the size growth by minor mergers alone might be sufficient , studies by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have combined idealized numerical simulations embedded in a cosmological context and new observational constraints .",
    "they come to the conclusion that minor mergers might be able to explain the observed size growth from redshift @xmath20 to the present",

    "the assembly histories of massive galaxies in currently favored hierarchical cosmological models are significantly more complex than a single binary merger .",
    "they grow - in particular at high redshift - by smooth accretion of gas , major mergers but also numerous minor mergers covering a large range of mass - ratios which can dominate the amount of assembled stars .",
    "the picture that is emerging from from semi - analytical models and high - resolution cosmological simulations of massive galaxies bears a two - phase characteristic @xcite .    at high redshifts",
    "the formation is dominated by dissipative processes ( i.e. significant radiative energy losses ) and in - situ star formation leading compact progenitors with high phase space densities . in a second phase",
    "massive galaxies are growing by the addition of stars at large radii that have formed early outside the main galaxies in other galaxies that were accreted later - on .",
    "this assembly phase is dominated by collisionless dynamics and radiative energy losses are of minor importance ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "independent studies using cosmological simulations based on different numerical methods come to similar conclusions that -on average - the mass assembly of massive galaxies is dominated by minor mergers with mass - ratios @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the relative importance of accreted versus in - situ formed stars increases with galaxy mass , a result that was already predicted by semi - analytical models @xcite and has been confirmed by independent estimates from abundance matching techniques @xcite .",
    "the absolute fractions are model dependent and can vary e.g. by @xmath25 50% for different feedback models ( see fig . [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "studies based on cosmological zoom simulations make a plausible point that the present day scaling relations might be set by the stellar accretion history of massive galaxies , i.e. the above mentioned fraction of in - situ to accreted stars @xcite . in addition ,",
    "based on still small samples , high - resolution cosmological simulations the evolution of the scaling relations appears to be in accordance with observations @xcite .",
    "however , in general the cosmological simulations of massive galaxies still fail to reproduce all observational constraints at the same time and are still limited with respect to either resolution and statistics as well as the algorithmic implementation of relevant feedback processes . in particular feedback from super - massive black holes might help to finally meet observational constraints for massive ellipticals @xcite .                      ,",
