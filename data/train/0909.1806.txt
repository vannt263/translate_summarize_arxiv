    "an accurate measurement of this is of fundamental importance , however , not only for the early stages of galaxy formation , but also for the understanding of the epoch of reionization and the role of galaxies therein .    for sources of such early cosmic times the inter - galactic medium absorbs most of the light blueward of ly@xmath24 , which is redshifted into the near infrared ( nir ) , where the sensitivities and fields of view of the detectors have lagged behind the optical ccd cameras .",
    "extremely deep nir imaging is needed to detect these galaxies . moreover ,",
    "due to limited spatial resolution of earlier ir cameras , it has not been possible so far to measure other basic quantities of @xmath0 galaxies such as sizes .    with the installation of the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) in service mission 4 of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) a new era of high redshift galaxy surveys has begun . with its large area , high sensitivity and small pixel size it allows us to probe faint objects much more efficiently than hst s previous nir camera nicmos ( near infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ) .",

    "<S> our data allow a first determination of the faint end slope of the @xmath0 luminosity function , reaching down to @xmath15 , a full magnitude fainter than previous measurements . when fixing @xmath16 mpc@xmath17mag@xmath18 to the value previously measured at @xmath19 , we find a best - fit value of @xmath20 , with a characteristic luminosity of @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> this steep slope is similar to what is seen at @xmath22 and indicates that low luminosity galaxies could potentially provide adequate flux to reionize the universe . </S>",
    "<S> the remarkable depth and resolution of these new images provide insights into the coming power of jwst . </S>"
