    "@xcite ) , and combinations of both ( combes @xcite ) .",
    "therefore statistics of bulges are needed to test the proposed dynamical processes of bulge formation .",
    "statistics of b / p bulges are of particular interest to demonstrate the importance of these structures for disk galaxies and to point out the relevant evolution scenarios of bulges in general . from the frequency of b / p bulges the likeliness of their formation process can be estimated .",
    "external cylindrically symmetric torques ( may et al .",
    "@xcite ) or mergers of two disk galaxies ( binney & petrou @xcite , rowley @xcite ) as origins of b / p bulges require very special conditions ( bureau @xcite ) .",
    "therefore such evolutionary scenarios can explain only a very low frequency of b / p bulges .",
    "accretion of satellite galaxies is a formation process of b / p bulges ( binney & petrou @xcite , whitmore & bell @xcite ) , which could produce a higher frequency of b / p bulges .",
    "however , an oblique impact angle of the satellite is needed for the formation of a b / p bulge and a massive accretion event would disrupt the stellar disk ( barnes @xcite , hernquist @xcite ) . the origin of b / p bulges by bars was first noticed by combes & sanders ( @xcite ) .",
    "combes et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and raha et al .",
    "( @xcite ) substantially revived this idea .",
    "comparisons between the frequency of barred galaxies and galaxies with a b / p bulge can test the probability of evolutionary scenarios of b / p bulges based on bars .",
    "the estimated frequency of galaxies with a b / p bulge has steadily increased in former statistics from 1.2% ( jarvis @xcite ) , over 13% ( de souza & dos anjos @xcite , hereafter sa87 ) and 20% ( shaw @xcite ) , up to 45% ( dettmar & barteldrees @xcite ) .",
    "this rise results from differences in sample selection , sample size , detection method , and criteria to identify b / p bulges .",
    "however , the later three statistical studies have shown that b / p bulges are not really as peculiar as they were supposed to be in the past .",
    "therefore very common processes are required to explain their high frequency .",
    "no complete statistics and list of galaxies with b / p bulges , based on observations , have been published in the last ten years .",
    "however , the knowledge about galactic evolution would greatly benefit from a reliable value for the frequency of b / p bulges by the determination of the most likely scenario for the formation of b / p bulges and subsequent conclusions on the evolution of bulges in general .",
    "a complete list of b / p bulges is a base for a detailed analysis of these structures .    in _ sect .",
    "2 _ we present our investigated sample of edge - on disk galaxies , and our classification of the bulge shape is explained in _ sect . 3_. the results of our statistics and of additional follow - up ccd observations in the optical and in the nir are given in _ sect .",
    "4_. _ sect . 5 _ compares our findings to former statistics . in _ sect .",
    "6 _ we discuss our results and finally , in _ sect . 7",
    "_ we give the conclusions from our statistical analysis of the sample .",
    "the first search for b / p bulges was conducted by jarvis ( @xcite ) . by visual inspection of all fields of the eso / serc @xmath2 sky survey he found therein 30 b / p bulges and listed additionally 11 galaxies with b / p bulges from the literature .",
    "together with a control sample he estimated that about 1.2% of all disk galaxies possess b / p bulges .",
    "shaw ( @xcite ) inspected visually the eso / serc @xmath2 and palomar observatory / national geographical survey ( poss ) @xmath3- or @xmath4-band scanned survey plates .",
    "he derived a frequency of b / p bulges of 20(@xmath5)% as a lower limit detecting 23 b / p bulges in a sample of 117 disk galaxies .",
    "the sample was mainly selected from the rc2 ( _ second reference catalogue of bright galaxies _ , de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "@xcite ) and included disk galaxies with a diameter @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) at the 25 ( @xmath3 ) mag arcsec@xmath8 isophotal level and a `` sufficiently '' edge - on aspect .    until today",
    "the largest investigated sample of 555 galaxies was presented by sa87 .",
    "their list was extracted from several catalogues and contained all disk galaxies with restricted total @xmath3 magnitude ( @xmath9 mag ) and axis ratio ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the galaxies were inspected on film copies of the eso quick blue survey or the poss prints by means of a microscope . a `` substantial number '' of candidates were scanned using the pds microdensitometer at eso and checked with an image processing system ( ihap ) . in this way sa87 found 74 b / p galaxies as a lower limit .",
    "this is 13% of their total sample .",
    "a much larger frequency of b / p bulges was proposed after the investigation of 73 galaxies obtained with ccd surface photometry ( dettmar & barteldrees @xcite , dettmar @xcite ) .",
    "that sample gave a frequency of @xmath11)% and dettmar ( @xcite ) concluded from this sample a lower limit of the total frequency of b / p bulges of 35% .",
    "however , only 15 objects with b / p bulge from this sample were listed by name in a paper of shaw et al .",
    "( @xcite ) together with other known b / p bulges from the literature .",
    "the former statistics in mind a new one should contain a large number of galaxies , be complete , and based on a detection method for the b / p bulges with reasonable accuracy . in the new statistics presented here the completeness with regard to the size of a galaxy is reached by the selection of all disk galaxies ( @xmath12 ) out of an electronic version of the rc3 with diameters larger than 2@xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) . for disk galaxies without known @xmath15 parameter it is determined separately ( see notes to table [ listrc3 ] )",
    ". extracting the sample from one catalogue is preferable to the method of sa87 since the parameters differ among the catalogues and an exact selection criterion is impossible .",
    "similar to shaw ( @xcite ) the selected sample is diameter limited , but compared to his sample the limit is nearly 2 times smaller .",
    "additionally , the use of the newer catalogue ( rc3 instead of rc2 ) leads to a much larger number of investigated galaxies . restricting the sample in diameter and not in @xmath16 magnitude",
    "is preferred because the rc3 attempts to be complete for galaxies with an apparent diameter larger than 1@xmath13 at the @xmath17 isophotal level and in addition , the @xmath16 magnitude is not even listed for all galaxies larger than 2@xmath13 .",
    "therefore a magnitude limit would not result in a complete sample .",
    "furthermore , a magnitude limit would prefer the selection of early type galaxies .",
    "since b / p bulges can only be observed at inclinations down to @xmath1875@xmath19 ( shaw et al .",
    "@xcite ) , in a first step all face - on galaxies are excluded using the axis ratio according to sa87 .",
    "s0 galaxies ( @xmath20 ) with @xmath21 and other disk galaxies with @xmath22 are included ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "these different limits are used since the transformation of the axis ratio into the inclination angle depends on the morphological type ( bottinelli et al .",
    "@xcite , guthrie @xcite ) . with different formulae (",
    "the simplest is cos @xmath24 ; see references in guthrie @xcite ) this restriction results for disk galaxies in a limit for the inclination angle @xmath25 between 60@xmath19 and 70@xmath19 degree .",
    "this limit ensures most likely a detection of all observable b / p bulges . the final sample meeting these selection criteria contains 1343 galaxies .",
    "the preferable method to classify a b / p bulge is the use of ccd images , but for the whole sample the amount of observing time would be unreasonably large . therefore",
    "all galaxies are inspected using the digitized sky survey ( dss ) .",
    "this survey is complete over the whole sky and an investigation of the images of the galaxies with data analysis software is possible .",
    "the dss is based on photographic surveys of the northern poss @xmath26 plates ( @xmath4-band , m@xmath27 20.0 mag ) , the southern serc @xmath2 plates ( equivalent to @xmath3-band , m@xmath27 23.0 mag ) , and the southern galactic plane serc @xmath28 plates ( @xmath28-band , m@xmath27 14.0 mag ) ( mclean @xcite ) and has a scale of @xmath29 .",
    "galaxies which are saturated in their central regions are checked ( if possible ) with the eso lauberts - valentijn archive ( lauberts & valentijn @xcite ) kindly made available by eso .",
    "while the images within the eso lauberts - valentijn archive are not saturated and have a better scale ( @xmath30 pixel@xmath31 ) , they have a lower signal - to - noise ratio compared to the images of the dss .",
    "shaw ( @xcite ) and ltticke ( @xcite ) derive objective parameters to characterize quantitatively b / p structures by the measurement of the excess luminosity and the total or maximal fraction of the b / p distortion ( depending on the radial distance from the center ) in relation to the observed bulge luminosity . however , the application of such a classification method is unpractical for a large sample of galaxies and strongly depends on the modelled luminosity distribution for the disk and the elliptical part of the bulge .",
    "the @xmath32 isophote shape parameter is used by combes et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , shaw ( @xcite ) , ltticke ( @xcite ) , and merrifield & kuijken ( @xcite ) to quantify the degree of boxiness of bulges by measuring the deviations from perfect ellipses ( e.g. bender & mllenhoff @xcite ) . however , it is problematic that the determination of the extreme value of @xmath32 depends on the fitted region of the bulge . fitting only the inner parts of bulges",
    "results in some galaxies in the undetection of the boxiness of the bulge which is most prominent in the outer parts .",
    "for instance the clear boxy bulge of ngc 1055 ( shaw @xcite , ltticke et al .",
    "@xcite , hereafter paper iii ) is undetected by merrifield & kuijken ( @xcite ) using the @xmath32 parameter .",
    "an additional disadvantage of the determination of this parameter is the influence of the masked stars in the foreground , dust , bars , and the extreme nature of b / p isophotal distortions for the ellipse fitting .",
    "therefore the region of the galaxy which is used for the fitting is important .",
    "shaw ( @xcite ) uses the whole galaxy , ltticke ( @xcite ) the disk subtracted galaxy , and merrifield & kuijken ( @xcite ) mask out a wedge - shaped region of each image within 12 degrees of the disk major axis and only fit `` on the side of the galaxy where the disk projects behind the bulge '' .",
    "these disadvantages lead to the fact that the @xmath32 parameter is not suitable for uniform classification of a large sample of bulges .",
    "additionally , the resolution of the dss images is too low to determine the @xmath32 parameter for the whole sample . therefore the bulges of the investigated sample are classified by their degree of b / p shape derived by visual inspection from contour plots of the galaxy images .",
    "reshetnikov & combes ( @xcite ) use similar arguments to choose a `` straightforward procedure of eyeball estimation '' with isophotal maps from the dss instead of objective criteria for the detection and classification of warped disks .",
    "the bulges are divided in three types of b / p bulges ( * 1 - 3 * ) , elliptical bulges , and unclassifiable bulges .",
    "peanut - shaped bulge    box - shaped bulge    bulge is close to box - shaped , not elliptical    elliptical bulge    unclassifiable bulge    type * 1 * bulges are described by a depression along the minor axis on both sides of the main axis . in this way",
    "the bulge looks like a peanut ( fig .",
    "[ dss ] , top ) .",
    "the depth of the depression can be used as a characteristic parameter for these peanut - shaped bulges ( ltticke @xcite ) .",
    "the box - shaped bulges ( type * 2 * ) are defined by isophotes parallel to the major axis",
    ". therefore the bulge appears like a box ( fig .",
    "[ dss ] , second image ) .",
    "some bulges of this class have a very prominent box form ( fig . [ n1886 ] , top )",
    ". they could be type * 1 * , but due to low resolution of the images it is not possible to see the eventual depression along the minor axis .",
    "these bulges are called * 2+*. the same class is used for bulges , which are on one side boxy and on the other peanut - shaped .",
    "type * 3 * ( fig .",
    "[ dss ] , third image ) is less well defined .",
    "these bulges possess a general flattening of the isophotes parallel to the major axis which is less pronounced as the flattening of type * 2*. however , this flattening differentiates these bulges from the purely elliptical bulges of type * 4 * ( fig .",
    "[ dss ] , bottom ) .",
    "the limits between the classes are not sharp : obvious between * 1 * and * 2 * , clear between * 2 * and * 3 * , but sometimes indistinct between * 3 * and * 4*. the classification of bulges can therefore in some cases be ambiguous , but a check of the whole sample ( two independent classifications by the author and one of the co - authors ) shows that more than 90% of the bulges are well defined by one of the different bulge types",
    ".    several reasons are differentiated why bulges are not classifiable :    inclination is too far away from edge - on .",
    "stars in the foreground projected onto the bulge .",
    "galaxy is strongly perturbed .",
    "dust conceals the shape of the bulge .",
    "bulge is too small .",
    "signal - to - noise ratio of the image is too low .    for galaxies which meet more than one of the above reasons only the most important one",
    "is listed ( table [ listrc3 ] and [ listf ] ) .",
    "the classification for all galaxies in the sample with some minor changes after inspection of ccd images ( sect .",
    "4.2 ) are given in table [ listrc3 ] .",
    "about 3/4 of the sdm and sm galaxies are not at all classifiable and the rest is highly uncertain , because the bulges of these galaxies  if they have any  are very small and faint and the influence of dust is very strong .",
    "other structures like bars or star forming regions are more dominant .",
    "therefore the selected sample is reduced to disk galaxies ranging from s0-sd ( @xmath33 ) resulting in 1224 galaxies which will be investigated in the following .",
    "40.0% of these bulges are unclassifiable , almost 3/4 of them due to an inclination which is too far from edge - on .",
    "this is an expected effect since the selection criterion of our sample for the inclination is a lower limit ( see above ) .",
    "only a few galaxies with a classifiable bulge in the sample have an axis ratio which is near to the sample limit of @xmath34 ( s0 ) and @xmath35 ( sa - sd ) , respectively .",
    "this shows that the limits are well chosen .",
    "there are only two peculiar edge - on galaxies known ( with @xmath36 ) which have classifiable bulges and are not in our sample due to their low axis ratio ( ic 2560 and ngc 7123 ) .",
    "therefore our list of galaxies with b / p bulges and a diameter larger than 2@xmath13 is almost complete and the number of non - included b / p bulges is small .",
    "stars in the foreground ( type 5.2 ) are responsible for 13% of unclassifiable bulges",
    ". these stars can influence the projected light from the galaxy in a way that the shape of the bulge can not be identified .",
    "dust lanes ( 5.4 ) prevent classifications in the same way , but only for a few galaxies , in which the dust lane has a large extension in comparison with the bulge size ( see also sect .",
    "their fraction decreases from late types and is equal to zero for galaxies earlier than sbc .",
    "scd and sd galaxies have too small bulges ( 5.5 ) for classification , if their diameter is around the limit of 2@xmath13 and their inclination is near to @xmath37 . at this orientation",
    "the measured diameter ( @xmath17 ) and therefore the ratio of disk to bulge length is maximal due to optical depth effects ( xilouris et al .",
    "the result is that galaxies of the same morphological type and diameter ( @xmath17 ) have bulges of different sizes which depend on the inclination angle .",
    "however , the fraction of galaxies in the sample having such small bulges is negligible ( table [ uncla ] ) . in a few cases galaxies",
    "are in the southern galactic plane ( 5.6 ) , where the dss has a higher surface brightness limit due to the use of the serc @xmath28 plates ( see above ) .",
    "therefore the images of the galaxies in this region have frequently a very small signal - to - noise ratio and the bulges appear to be too faint for classification .",
    "perturbations ( 5.3 ) by interactions are only in a very few cases the reason for bulges being not classifiable",
