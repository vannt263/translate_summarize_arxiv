    "the search for possible candidates of a quantum spin liquid state has been one of the central issues in condensed matter physics since it was proposed several decades ago  @xcite . in the last years",
    "@xmath0-(et)@xmath1cu@xmath1(cn)@xmath2 has attracted much attention due to its unique realization of a pressure - induced mott transition from a spin liquid state  @xcite to a metallic or even superconducting state at low temperatures .",
    "a large amount of theoretical investigations on the one - band half - filled hubbard model on the anisotropic triangular lattice have been carried out in order to understand the mechanism of the phase transition .",
    "irrespective of the current debate on the phase diagram , such as presence or absence of spin - liquid or superconducting state , derived from this simplified model by various methods , like , path integral renormalization group approach  @xcite , variational monte carlo method  @xcite , cluster extension of dynamical mean - field theory  @xcite , or exact diagonalization  @xcite a question of fundamental importance is whether the existing model parameters obtained from extended hckel molecular orbital calculations  @xcite are reliable or not , as they are the basis of all the mentioned theoretical work .",
    "recently we showed by full potential ab initio density functional theory ( dft ) calculations that the model parameters for @xmath0-(et)@xmath1cu@xmath1(cn)@xmath2 have to be qualitatively revised from @xmath3=1.06  @xcite to @xmath3=0.83@xmath40.08  @xcite , which casts doubts on the validity of the description of the system as coupled quasi - one - dimensional chains .",
    "similar results were obtained by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we discuss the importance of including in the results for @xmath3 the effects of considering different wavefunction bases as well as exchange correlation functionals within dft .",
    "furthermore , we show that alternative fitting procedures provide slightly different @xmath3 ratios .",
    "all these considerations lead to a statement of the @xmath3 ratios within a benchmark .",
    "finally we also discuss the effects of longer ranged hoppings .",
    "these considerations are important for all @xmath0-(et)@xmath1x charge transfer salts and we present here also details of the bandstructure calculations and parameter determination for x = cu(scn)@xmath1 .",
    "the crystal structure of @xmath0-(et)@xmath1cu@xmath1(cn)@xmath2 consists of alternate stackings of pairs of et = bedt - ttf molecule donors ( see fig .",

    "a common feature of @xmath0-(et)@xmath1cu@xmath1(cn)@xmath2 and other related bedt - ttf based salts is the presence of conformational disorder .",
    "the two terminal ethylene groups in the bedt - ttf molecule are twisted out of the molecular plane , and therefore this molecule has either an eclipsed or staggered conformation",
    ". the salt exhibits disorder at room temperature due to the random occurence of both conformations .",
    "the @xmath0-(et)@xmath1cu@xmath1(cn)@xmath2 salt crystallizes in the monoclinic space group @xmath7 .",
    "the inversion centre symmetry in @xmath7 is guaranteed by the equal occupation of the two conformations . at low temperatures the staggered conformation dominates over the eclipsed conformation ,",
    "therefore the staggered conformation was used in the calculations .",
    "the symmetry is then reduced to @xmath8 with 120 atoms in the unit cell .    moreover , since the hydrogen positions were not available from experiment  @xcite we introduced them in the structure and relaxed their positions by performing car - parrinello projector - augmented wave molecular dynamics ( cpmd ) calculations  @xcite . for these calculations we considered a ( 4 @xmath9 4 @xmath9 4 ) * k*-mesh in the brillouin zone and plane wave cutoffs of 60 and 240 ry for the wave function and the charge density , respectively .",
    "the electronic structure was analyzed by considering two different all - electron codes , namely the the full potential local orbital method ( fplo version 8.50 - 32 )  @xcite and the full potential linearized augmented plane wave ( fplapw ) method as implemented in wien2k  @xcite .",
    "we also performed comparative calculations with different exchange correlation functionals , the local density approximation ( lda ) in the parameterization of perdew and wang  @xcite and the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) in the perdew - burke - ernzerhof parameterization  @xcite .",
    "the convergency of the band structure with respect to the brillouin zone integrations was checked with a series of calculations with up to 350 * k*-points in the full brillouin zone . in the fplapw calculations",
    "a plane wave cut - off @xmath10 was used and the muffin - tin - radii for cu , n , c , h , and s were chosen as 2.37 , 1.06 , 1.16/1.06 , 0.92 , and 2.00 a.u .",

    "those bands are derived almost entirely from s 3p and c 2p states of the bedt - ttf molecule and well separated from the remaining lower occupied and higher unoccupied bands .",
    "about 0.3 to 0.6 ev below the fermi energy two further bedt - ttf derived bands with mainly s 3p and c 2p character are visible .",
    "this is in an overall good agreement with the results of extended hckel calculations  @xcite , which find two anti - bonding bands of the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) of the bedt - ttf molecule intersecting the fermi energy and place the corresponding bonding bands about 0.4 ev below the fermi energy .",
    "the cu 3d states form a narrow band complex about 0.4 to 2.1 ev below the fermi energy . the cu 3d shell is completely filled , in agreement with the experimental reports  @xcite that the cu atoms are in the cu@xmath13 state with 10 d electrons .",
    "a comparison of the band structure of @xmath0-(et)@xmath1cu@xmath1(cn)@xmath2 near the fermi surface between the gga and lda functional is shown in fig .  [ fig : ggavslda ] .",
    "the two highest cu 3d bands intersect the two bonding bedt - ttf derived bands in gga , whereas the lda calculations place the cu 3d bands further below the fermi energy , so that the four bedt - ttf derived bands near the fermi energy are separated from the remaining bands within lda .",
    "the difference in the position of the cu 3d level between lda and gga amounts to about 0.2 ev , resulting in a rigid band shift with only a minute effect on the shape of the bedt - ttf bands near the fermi energy and the model parameters derived from them ( see below ) . a similar difference between lda and gga derived band structures",

    "there are also minor differences in the band structures calculated with the two different electronic structure codes ( fig .",

    "while the two bedt - ttf derived bands crossing the fermi energy are almost exactly on top of each other , the lower occupied bands are shifted by about 50 mev between the fplo and fplapw calculations . a possible reason for this difference could be the size of the basis set used in the calculations .",
    "however , we could not analyze the origin of these smaller differences in more detail , since the complexity of the crystal structure does not allow for extensive numerical checks .",
    "in addition to the cu 3d bands there are further bedt - ttf derived bands in the energy region between -2.5 and -0.75 ev giving rise to the complex band structure shown in fig .  [ fig : bsdos ] .",
    "seperated by a pseudo gap of about 0.5 ev a complex manifold of bedt - ttf and anion layer derived bands is visible starting from 3 ev below the fermi energy .",
