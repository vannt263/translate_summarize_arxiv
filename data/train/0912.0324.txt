    "single particle quantum devices work essentially in a quantum mechanical way by using the whole features of quantum states , especially the phases of quantum states .",
    "a typical example is the single electron transistor ( set ) @xcite and its photon analogue @xcite , which plays a central role in quantum manipulation and quantum measurement .",
    "a set is a mesoscopic system that allows confined electrons to tunnel to the metallic leads .",

    ", we will pay attention to another single particle quantum device , which can be understood as the quantum analogue of the conventional diode device . in practice ,",
    "diode devices are indispensable for building various electronic circuits in the traditional electronics .",
    "accordingly , once a coherent diode device has been implemented , a single - particle quantum circuit may be further realized in the level of single quantum state by using of the two basic elements , single particle transistor and diode .",
    "compared with the traditional electrocircuits based on the density distribution of electrons , the new quantum circuit makes full use of the quantum properties including quantum phases in information processing . in this sense",
    ", we can also regard it as a necessary element in quantum information science and technology .",
    "a major research effort in recent years is to seek a simplest single particle system with diode features @xcite , which is characterized by the asymmetric performance of transmission coefficients along the opposite directions . in the present investigation",
    ", we find that a three - site tight - binding ring system threaded by an aharonov - bohm ( ab ) magnetic flux has analogy to a perfect diode in a wide range of parameters .",
    "in addition , our studies are not restricted to the charged particle case . for a neutral particle system ,",
    "an effective magnetic flux is induced by applying a globe rotation @xcite , which can also break the time reversal symmetry and lead to the asymmetric transmissions .",
    "it is shown that the difference of the two output currents is linearly proportional to the rotational angular velocity approximately , which behaves as a new kind of extended sagnac gyroscope @xcite .",

    "et al . _ have found that the conductance of a multi - terminal sample is asymmetric in the presence of an ab flux buttiker86,azbel81,buttiker85 .",
    "realization of such mechanism in quantum device requires its size being smaller than the phase - breaking length . thus seeking a minimized system with asymmetric feature is attractive in practice .",
    "a discrete system may be a good candidate to accomplish such a task .",
    "it is of both theoretical and practical importance to study this theory in a discrete system .",
    "moreover , we show practical applications of the quantum interference effect as single electron diode and single particle gyroscope . in the general discussion part",
