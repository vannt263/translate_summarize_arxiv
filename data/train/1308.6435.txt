    "superconducting qubits are a class of two - level systems based on the superconducting josephson junctions  @xcite . when interacting with a microwave field stalled in a stripline resonator , they act like artificial atoms in optical cavities with coherent exchange of photon energy modeled on the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "this combination gives rise to circuit quantum electrodynamics ( qed )  @xcite , an emulation of cavity qed .",
    "circuit qed systems with superconducting qubits can therefore emulates , in many aspects , quantum optical effects similar to those originally discovered on real atoms or atomic media  @xcite and can be regarded as a type of quantum simulators  @xcite .",
    "so far , studies of circuit qed only concerns with circuits of a few superconducting qubits and each qubit is considered acting separately with the stripline resonator . to understand their collective behavior ,",
    "a many - qubit theory is wanted . however , traditional many - atom theories such as the frenkel model for excitons can not not be applied because circuit qed systems contain only a finite number of artificial atoms , i.e. , large-@xmath0 limit is not taken .",
    "neither do models for finite @xmath0 , such as the tavis - cummings ( tc ) model  @xcite apply because the mesoscopic sizes of the qubits and of the spacings between the qubits in a circuit make their dipole - field interaction to the stripline resonator inhomogeneous . to remedy the inapplicability ,",
    "we have proposed a projection - deformation model that generalizes the tc - model to work on inhomogeneous coupling scenarios  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is that while real atoms form a lattice , the superconducting qubits form a quasi - lattice , whose `` quasi - ness '' is measured by the degree of deformation it departs from a normal lattice .",
    "this deformation is related to a deformed su(2 ) algebra  @xcite obeyed by the collective spin operators of the quasi - lattice and is quantified by a c - number deformation factor .",
    "this factor is parametrized by the ratio of the uniform lattice spacing @xmath1 to the wavelength @xmath2 of the interacting photon .",
    "we call this ratio the relative spacing @xmath3 of the qubits . the analytical excitation spectrum of the quasi - lattice can then be computed by diagonalizing the deformation - dependent interaction hamiltonian .      the excited states of the quasi - lattice ought to spontaneously radiate microwave photons into the circuit waveguide .",
    "but in a circuit qed system , the excitation mode of the quasi - lattice is coherently coupled to a stripline resonator mode , where the mixed mode of the two forms a cavity polariton .",
    "therefore , unlike the conventional radiation problems treated in atomic physics , such as the dicke radiation  @xcite , the radiation in the mesoscopic circuit cavity is associated with the dynamics of the polariton , i.e. a _ dressed _ quasi - lattice excitation mode , instead of a bare lattice excitation mode .",
    "it is known that , in a dielectric , the polariton mode is generated by the recombination of the collective atomic excitations with the radiated photons  @xcite .",
    "the polariton mode we treat here , on the other hand , is generated by the dressing through the cavity photon .",
    "the definition is similar to that given in semiconductor cavity qed systems  @xcite .",
    "the radiated photon modes are designated in a separate hilbert space from that of the cavity photon mode .",
    "therefore , even though the radiation processes are both polariton - mediated , the case for a quasi - lattice of qubits is vastly different from the case of a dielectric .    besides",
    ", the energies and the eigenstates of the quasi - lattice excitation modes are modified by the deformation described above .",
    "the composition of the fock number states of the polariton depends thus not only on the eigenenergy of the qubits , but also on the deformation of the quasi - lattice .",
    "it was shown that the structure of the underlying medium has a large influence on the pattern and form of the radiation .",
    "for example , the spontaneous emission is found directionally dependent on the incident photon  @xcite in an extended medium ; uneven decay rates is found in a spherical symmetric medium by including virtual photon processes  @xcite ; and nonlocal effect arises for single - photon cooperative emission  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate how the structural change introduced by the deformation of the quasi - lattice affects the radiation spectrum and the polariton decay .",
    "we find that the cavity polariton has an acutely _ selective _ distribution of its radiated microwave photon based on the deformation .",
    "this is shown by the varying amplitude of the interaction coefficient between the polariton and the continuum of photon modes in the momentum space .",
    "this amplitude depends on the relative spacing and has a quasi - periodicity that matches this relative spacing with the wavelength of the cavity photon , demonstrating the selectiveness of the quasi - lattice about its radiation .",
    "specifically , at the exact periodic positions where the radiated photon resonates with the cavity , the magnitude of the interaction will obtain its maximum value .",
    "moreover , we find that the polariton decay is also deformation - dependent on the relative spacing .",
    "in fact , as predicted by dicke , the decay rate of an @xmath0-atom lattice would increase to @xmath4 when the spin moment of the lattice is at the maximum cooperation number of @xmath5 , giving rise to superradiance  @xcite and superfluorescence  @xcite .",
    "for the quasi - lattice of qubits , it is found that the maximum decay rate is obtained when the relative spacing is set to one half , where only every other qubit couples to the cavity photon .",
    "this alternate pattern of coupling excites half of the qubits while leaving the other half unaffected , giving an effective spin moment of @xmath5 to the quasi - lattice and having the decay rate match with the dicke model of cooperated radiation .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "the formation of cavity polariton in a quasi - lattice is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : polaritons ] , where the transition matrices for the quasi - lattice as deformed su(2 ) spin is derived in the polariton basis . by writing the qubit operators terms of these matrices using a discrete fourier transform , we derive the expression of the quasi - periodic interaction coefficient for radiation in sec .",

    "each qubit can be modeled as a two - level system @xmath7 in the diagonalized basis of the josephson and charge energies of the junctions that it contains .",
    "depending on the type of the qubit , the diagonalized eigenenergy is tunable through magnetic flux , gate charge , phase , etc .",

    "however , when the qubits are all tuned resonant with the fundamental mode , the cavity field can be effectively regarded as a single - mode field  @xcite .",
    "we describe this fundamental mode ( the red curve in the figure ) by the annihilation operator @xmath9 and denote its frequency and wavelength by @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "note that even though the dimensions of a qubit are negligible compared to the wavelength @xmath11 , the spacings between the qubits are non - negligible and the coupling of each qubit to the cavity field depends on the relative spacing @xmath12 described above through a sinusoidal factor @xmath13 .",
    "the variable @xmath14 consequently can be regarded as a relative coordinate for the qubits along the one - dimensional chain of qubits .",
    "this chain of qubits can be regarded as a quasi - lattice , which resembles an atomic lattice but has an inhomogeneous coupling due to its mesoscopic nature .",
    "this quasi - lattice of qubits is also environmentally coupled to a reservoir , represented by a continuum of quantum oscillators @xmath15 with frequency spectrum @xmath16 , which gives rise to spontaneous radiation in and out of the waveguide .",

    "note that , unlike the treatments for radiation in atomic media where confinements in pencil - shape geometries are usually assumed  @xcite , the waveguide in superconducting circuits are strictly one - dimensional and thus @xmath17 is regarded as a wave number , not a wave vector .",

    "( [ eq : sys_ham])-([eq : int_ham ] ) assumes a strong coupling operation regime for the qubits , where each qubit has a maximal coupling strengh @xmath22 much greater than the linewidth of the circuit cavity , to ensure coherent exchange of photons with the circuit cavity while the non - rotating wave terms for the virtual photons can be ignored  @xcite .",
    "further , based on the current experiment setups  @xcite , the magnitude of @xmath22 is much smaller than @xmath8 such that the quasi - lattice system on the other hand does not enter into the ultra - strong coupling ( usc ) regime .",
    "when @xmath22 is comparable to @xmath8 , usc operation will dominate and squeezing terms of @xmath23 and @xmath24 have to be taken into considerations  @xcite .",
    "these terms entail complex implications to dicke phase transitions on circuit qed systems  @xcite .",

    "@xmath25 _ where each @xmath26 is the internal energy eigenspace for a qubit , @xmath27 is the fock eigenspace for the cavity photon , and each @xmath28 is the fock eigenspace for spontaneous emitted photon of wave number @xmath17 . a specific system state vector , for example , in this tripartite hilbert space can be written as @xmath29 where the first subvector denotes the configuration of the quasi - lattice of qubits , the second that of cavity photon number , and the third that of the photon momentum radiated by each qubit in the quasi - lattice .",
