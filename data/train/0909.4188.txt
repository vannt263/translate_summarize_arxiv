    "uru@xmath0si@xmath0 is a heavy fermion compound with a body centered tetragonal crystal structure in its paramagnetic phase . at ambient pressure , on lowering the temperature below @xmath1k a transition occurs into a hidden order phase which can not be a conventional magnetic phase . over the last decade ,",
    "the picture was that of small moment antiferromagnetism ( as all neutron scattering experiments point out a tiny ordered moment @xmath11 with the propagation vector @xmath12 @xcite ) associated with an electronic instability corresponding to a loss of electronic carriers at @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the departure from the conventional af picture is clearly demonstrated by the fact that the entropy loss at @xmath13 , @xmath14 , is too high to be accounted for exclusively by the formation of localized tiny ordered moments .",
    "nmr and @xmath15sr spectroscopy rule out an intrinsic origin of the tiny sublattice magnetization @xcite ; the small moment seems generated by lattice defaults .",
    "this high sensitivity to lattice imperfections is clearly related with the observation that at a rather weak pressure @xmath16gpa @xcite the ground state switches from ho to af ground state with a substantional sublattice magnetization @xmath17 at @xmath18 with the same @xmath19 . here",
    "we tune from ho to af under pressure to clarify the main properties of each phase and in particular noting their inelastic neutron scattering spectra .",
    "+ at the opposite to the elastic af neutron scattering response at ambient pressure , the inelastic neutron scattering signals are very robust @xcite : excellent agreement exists between results .",
    "below @xmath13 , inelastic neutron scattering experiments indicate two sharp and intense excitations , one with a symmetric shape in the energy spectrum at the incommensurate position @xmath20 with a gap @xmath21 mev and another one with an asymmetric shape at the wavevector @xmath22 = ( 1 , 0 , 0 ) with a gap @xmath23mev .",
    "note that the wavevector @xmath24 is in another brillouin zone equivalent to the ordering wavevector @xmath12 .",
    "on warming above @xmath13 , both excitations respond differently .",
    "the signal at @xmath22 is quasielastic and strongly damped , whereas at @xmath25 it remains inelastic but so strongly damped that the spectrum is not fully gapped any more .",
    "the @xmath26-evolution of the excitation at @xmath25 and equivalent positions can explain the specific heat anomaly at @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to recognize that if no phase transition occured at @xmath13 , uru@xmath0si@xmath0would be a classical intermediate valence compound ; it is the feedback between spin dynamics and band structure reconstruction which leads to the fact that below @xmath13 sharp excitations at @xmath22 and @xmath25 emerge @xcite .",

    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the ( @xmath26,@xmath2 ) phase diagram of uru@xmath0si@xmath0as recently determined by resistivity and microcalorimetry experiments @xcite .",
    "special attention was given in the determination of the three lines : @xmath13(@xmath2 ) of the transition from pm to ho , @xmath27(@xmath2 ) from ho to af and @xmath28(@xmath2 ) from pm to af .",

    "both excitations exist at 0.87gpa but disappear simultaneously at 1.86gpa .",
    "taking into account progress in the determination of the ( @xmath2,@xmath26 ) phase diagram and also our recent ability to measure simultaneously neutron scattering and thermal expansion via a strain gauge in the same pressure cell , we decided to study at a selected pressure @xmath2 between @xmath7 and @xmath32 ( vertical green line in figure [ fig1 ] ) the evolution of the inelastic neutron scattering spectrum in the three phases pm , ho and af for both @xmath22 and @xmath25 using the high performance of the respective triple axis spectrometers in12 and in22 at the institut laue langevin ( ill ) @xcite .",

    "the lines are guides to the eye.@xcite , title=\"fig : \" ]    of the ho phase as it disappears below @xmath33k while the signal at @xmath20 remains but shifts in energy .",
    "considering the fact that the @xmath4 excitation is characteristic of strong longitudinal fluctuations at the wavevector @xmath19 and that no drastic difference is detected in the carrier number between both sides of @xmath7 @xcite , the proposal is that the fermi surface reconstruction at @xmath13 and @xmath28 are identical .",
    "this statement is supported by our recent study of shubnikov - de haas oscillations through @xmath7 [ hassinger _ et al . _ to be published ] , where it was observed that the three observed frequencies ( @xmath34 ) are @xmath2 invariant . in the af",
    "phase the two uranium sites are inequivalent and the symmetry changes . in excellent agreement with band structure calculations",
    "@xcite , a drop of carrier density is associated with this change . in the ho phase ,",
    "our measurements strongly suggest that @xmath19 will also be the wavevector of the ho state .",

    "+ a recent complementary experiment was to continue the inelastic neutron scattering studies with the addition of a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the experiments were performed on the in14 spectrometer at the ill and    scattering intensity at the magnetic bragg peak position as a function of temperature at a fixed pressure of 0.72gpa in zero field ( black dots , left scale ) compared to the same signal in reference @xcite(red dots+line ) at 0.67gpa .",

    "restricted to the field evolution of the @xmath22 excitations .",
    "the reduction of signal by the combined use of a pressure cell in a cryomagnet device ( high magnetic field up to 14.5 t ) led us to prepare a large crystal of 6 mm diameter and 11 mm length oriented with the easy c magnetization axis along the magnetic field h ; the selected transmitted medium was a mixture of fluorinert fc 84/fc 87 .",
    "as before , the selected pressure @xmath37gpa was verified via the detection of the phase transitions pm - ho - af via the thermal expansion measured by strain gauge .",
    "figure [ n+t ] shows the temperature dependence of the magnetic bragg peak intensity ( measurement of the intensity at the @xmath24 position ) at zero field at 0.72gpa ( black dots ) . by comparison",
    ", the signal obtained with the previous pressure experiments is drawn as well as the relative variation of the thermal expansion coefficient .",
    "it is obvious that pressure inhomogeneities exist in the present set up and that furthermore the deviation from hydrostatics is larger than the previous set up . from the @xmath6 and @xmath26 evolution of the bragg reflection",
    ", we can estimate that 10% of `` parasitic ho '' phase remains even at @xmath38 and @xmath36gpa while ideal conditions will lead to the complete disappearence of the ho component as in the previous measurement ( see figure [ fig2 ] , left panel ) .",
    "however , following the field evolution of the intensity of the bragg reflection at different temperatures ( figure [ n+p]a ) , a complete disappearence of af occurs above @xmath8(@xmath39 0 ) = 11 t .",
    "the figure [ n+p]b represents the temperature evolution of the field @xmath40 where af disappears .",

    "inelastic neutron scattering experiments lead to the interesting result that a nice excitation reemerges above @xmath8 for @xmath24 ( shown in figure [ fig2 ] ) , the weak contribution detected at @xmath41 being a consequence of the 10 % parasitic ho survivance . taking into account our previous @xmath2 study , our proposal is that the disappearance of af is associated with the field reentrance of the ho phase .",
    "increasing further the magnetic field , the ho will be destroyed above @xmath9 t ( the field to suppress the ho at zero pressure is @xmath9 t and increases with pressure @xcite ) . in this high field domain , the original higher carrier number of the pm phase will be recovered and different phases occur@xcite .",
    "neutron scattering experiments are crucial to point out the nature of the ( @xmath2 , @xmath6 ) induced phases , however it is very arduous to realize a systematic pressure study .",
    "this was achieved by detecting the ( @xmath2,@xmath6 ) evolution of the transition temperatures by thermal expansion via a strain gauge as represented in figure [ 3d ] .    at @xmath7",
    "bulk superconductivity collapses as well as the excitation at @xmath24 .",
    "surprisingly , no inelastic neutron scattering experiment at this wavevector has been reported in the sc phase . that led us to conduct an accurate inelastic scattering experiment with a high quality crystal ( @xmath42k from the measurement of its diamagnetic shielding ) down to 0.4k on in12 spectrometer at ill @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence of the inelastic spectrum for both @xmath22 and @xmath25 excitations were recorded .",
    "figure [ excitations ] shows the intensity of the inelastic response at @xmath22 for @xmath43k ( @xmath44 ) and @xmath45k ( @xmath46 ) . at 2k",
    ", no quasielastic contribution can be detected at    energy spectra at the position @xmath24 above the superconducting transition at 2k and below it at 0.4k at ambient pressure .",
    "the lines are guides to the eye . ]",
    "low energy ; the same lack of quasielastic component was observed for the energy response at @xmath25 . at a first glance",
    ", no drastic change occurs below @xmath47 at @xmath45k for both wavevectors @xmath22 and @xmath25 : no emergence of a low energy resonance characteristic of the superconducting pairing as observed for the heavy fermion superconductors upd@xmath0al@xmath48 , cecu@xmath0si@xmath0 and cecoin@xmath49 @xcite . looking more closely , the excitation at @xmath22 shifts by @xmath50@xmath15ev , while the excitation at @xmath25 remains unchanged .",
    "the shift in energy of the excitation at @xmath22 through @xmath47 as well as the collapse of the inelastic response above @xmath7 may suggest that the origin of the sc pairing can be magnetic excitations as proposed for upd@xmath0al@xmath48 .",
    "the absence of detectable , low energy quasielastic ( @xmath51 ) or resonant ( @xmath52 ) contributions at q@xmath53 by comparison to upd@xmath0al@xmath48 , cecu@xmath0si@xmath0 and cecoin@xmath49 can be explained partly by the weakness of its sommerfeld coefficient @xmath54 ( @xmath55mjmol@xmath56k@xmath57 in uru@xmath0si@xmath0 , 140mjmol@xmath56k@xmath57 in upd@xmath0al@xmath48 , about 1000mjmol@xmath56k@xmath57 in cecu@xmath0si@xmath0 and cecoin@xmath49@xcite ) .",
    "indeed a weak @xmath54 corresponds to a large relaxation rate for the normal state fluctuations ( @xmath51 ) and therefore the excitation spectrum is spread out in energy space .",
    "it is also possible that this magnetic response in uru@xmath0si@xmath0is not strongly structured in momentum space as well contrarily to the three previous cases where the quasielastic response is concentrated along the antiferromagnetic hot spot .",
    "the case of uru@xmath0si@xmath0appears rather similar to that of the skutterudite system pros@xmath58sb@xmath59 where despite a rather large @xmath54-term ( @xmath60mjmol@xmath56k@xmath57 ) no quasielastic contribution has been detected around any wavevector@xcite . for the case of pros@xmath58sb@xmath59 , it was recently stressed that the mass enhancement may originate from the aspherical coulomb scattering of conductions electrons from the very low energy singlet - triplet crystalline electric field excitation @xcite .",
    "this mechanism is related to the dominant quadrupolar degrees of freedom at play in this compound .",
    "multipolar degreees of freedom may be involved in the formation of complex hidden order phase in uru@xmath0si@xmath0 .    on entering under pressure above @xmath7 in the af phase , it was observed from resistivity measurements that the gap energy jumps to a higher value at @xmath7@xcite . according to @xmath2 studies realized on 1 - 1 - 5 heavy fermion systems such as cerhin@xmath49 on the duality between af and sc",
    ", this jump can explain the collapse of sc in the af phase@xcite .",
    "thus the proof that the @xmath4 excitation may be the source of the sc pairing deserves more theoretical treatment .",
    "new neutron scattering experiments show clearly that the excitation at @xmath24 is characteristic of the hidden order state .",
    "it disappears under pressure at @xmath7 where the ground state switches from ho to af and is restored above @xmath8 where the groundstate switches from af to ho .",
    "there are strong indications from spin dynamics , but also from transport measurements that the wavevector of the ho phase is @xmath12 .",
    "it is also demonstrated that the @xmath22 excitation is directly coupled with superconductivity ( @xmath2 and @xmath26 variation ) .",
    "experimentally , uru@xmath0si@xmath0is a beautiful case where the main effect at the first order transition at @xmath7 occurs on the sublattice magnetization , on the inelastic neutron scattering response and on the thermal expansion , while other probes like the bulk magnetization , the resistivity , the shubnikov - de haas oscillations have only minor changes @xcite . for neutron scattering ,",
    "the next targets are to determine the relation between the sharp excitations at @xmath22 and @xmath25 and the fermi surface reconstruction",
    ". theoretical work on the absence of quasielastic response , on the source of sc pairing and on the ( @xmath2-@xmath6 ) instability of ho and af phases is strongly needed .",
