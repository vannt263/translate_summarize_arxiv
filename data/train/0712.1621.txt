    "this paper is about an integer sequence that appears in two very different places .",
    "the sequence in question is sequence a000570 in the online encyclopedia of integer sequences ( oeis ) , where it is described as : `` number of tournaments on n nodes determined by their score vectors . ''",
    "it is interesting to note that i generated this sequence while playing with rules for radar tracking .",
    "the material in this paper loosely follows the order in which i discovered the facts about this sequence .",
    "radars or sonar detectors detect and track targets in a series of observations . the result of an observation can be described as detection or no detection .",
    "there are rules for a series of detections to produce a track on a target .",
    "one of the most commonly used rules is called `` 3 out of 5 with 2 loss '' @xcite .",
    "the rule means that to get a track , the radar must have at least 3 detections in a series of 5 or fewer observations and there should nt be two non - detections in a row between two consecutive detections . in other words , if you have two consecutive non - detections you have lost your track and you must start again .    if we represent a detection as 1 and a non - detection as 0 , the result of series of @xmath2 observations is a binary string of length @xmath2 . for every binary string we can say whether the detections and non - detections described by this string establish a track or not .",
    "if we count the number of track - producing strings of length @xmath2 , we get an integer sequence that we call a tracking sequence . correspondingly",
    ", we can count the number of non - track producing strings of length @xmath2 and get a non - tracking sequence .",
    "obviously , we can define tracking and non - tracking sequences for any tracking rule . in this paper",
    "we only discuss the particular rule `` 3 out of 5 with loss 2 . ''",
    "let me introduce some notations .",
    "i denote by @xmath3 the tracking sequence  the number of binary strings of length @xmath2 that produce a track .",
    "the non - tracking sequence @xmath4 is the number of binary strings of length @xmath2 that do not allow tracking .",
    "obviously , @xmath5 .",
    "that means to calculate these two sequences , it is enough to calculate one of them .",
    "non - tracking sequences are usually easier to calculate .",
    "so , let s calculate @xmath4",
    ".    here is the list of non - tracking strings for @xmath6 .    1 .   for @xmath7",
    "any string is a non - tracking string .",
    "the list of non - tracking strings is : 0 , 1 .",
    "the total is 2 . 2 .",
    "the same thing happens for @xmath8 .",
    "the list of non - tracking strings is : 00 , 01 , 10 , 11 .",
    "the total is 4 .",
    "3 .   for @xmath9 ,",
    "the only tracking string is the string with 3 ones . hence the non - tracking strings are : 000 , 001 , 010 , 011 , 100 , 101 , 110 .",
    "the total is 7 .",
    "4 .   for @xmath10",
    "a non - tracking string is any string of length 4 that does nt contain 3 ones : 0000 , 0001 , 0010 , 0011 , 0100 , 0101 , 0110 , 1000 , 1001 , 1010 , 1100 .",
    "the total is 11 .",
    "5 .   for @xmath11",
    "a non - tracking string is any string of length 5 that does nt contain 3 ones , plus the strings that contain 3 ones but have two zeroes in between .",
    "namely : 00000 , 00001 , 00010 , 00011 , 00100 , 00101 , 00110 , 01000 , 01001 , 01010 , 01100 , 10000 , 10001 , 10010 , 10011 , 10100 , 11000 , 11001 .",
    "the total is 18 .",
    "we see that @xmath4 starts as : 2 , 4 , 7 , 11 , 18 , @xmath12 .",
    "i will not bore you by describing the java program i wrote to calculate this sequence .",
    "the result was : 2 , 4 , 7 , 11 , 18 , 31 , 53 , 89 , 149 , 251 , 424 , 715 , 1204 , 2028 , @xmath12 .",
    "i plugged the numbers into the online encyclopedia of integer sequences ( oeis ) @xcite and i got : a000570  number of tournaments on n nodes determined by their score vectors .",
    "in mathematics a tournament describes the results of a bunch of people who gather together to play a game of tennis in a round - robin or all - play - all style .",
    "you can replace tennis by any other game where every two people play with each other once and draws are not allowed .",
    "so , a mathematical tournament is a competition in which there is a winner for every pair of competitors . or to put it more formally , a tournament is a complete oriented graph .",
    "the score vector is the list of total wins for every participant , where the order of participants does not matter . in other words , the score vector can be defined as a non - decreasing array of outdegrees of the vertices of the tournament graph .",
    "a tournament is called unique if it is uniquely defined by its score vector .",
    "i will denote by @xmath13 the number of unique tournaments with @xmath2 people ( vertices ) .",
    "let us take a look at the unique tournaments sequence :    1 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 7 , 11 , 18 , 31 , 53 , 89 , 149 , 251 , 424 , 715 , 1204 , 2028 , 3418 , @xmath12 .",
    "here the first element has index 1 .",
    "there is only one tournament with only 1 participant : no games were played and the score vector is @xmath14 . with two participants there exists only one tournament : one person wins and the other person loses .",
    "the score vector of this tournament is @xmath15 . with 3 participants there",
    "can be 2 different tournaments .",
    "the first tournament with a score vector @xmath16 has one champion who won every game and one loser who lost every game .",
    "the second tournament with a score vector @xmath17 does nt have a champion .",
    "see figure  [ small ] for the graphs of very small tournaments of up to three people .",
    "tournaments up to 4 people are always unique .",
    "non - unique tournaments appear when there are 5 competitors or more . for tournaments with 5 people",
    "there are two score vectors , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , that define several non - isomorphic tournaments .",
    "figure  [ nonunique ] shows 3 non - isomorphic tournaments defined by the score vector @xmath18 .",
    "the indexing of the unique tournament sequence is slightly different from the tracking sequence .",
    "namely , @xmath20 .",
    "we will return to this shift later .",
    "if we check the entry in the oeis about the unique tournaments sequence we can find a recurrence relation for it : @xmath21    i have shown that the non - tracking sequences and the unique tournament sequences have the same start . to prove that these sequences are truly the same , it is enough to prove the recurrence relation [ e : rec ] for the non - tracking sequence .",
    "[ l : rec ] the non - tracking sequence @xmath4 satisfies the recurrence : @xmath22    let us assume that @xmath2 is more than 5 and count the number of non - tracking strings of length @xmath2 .",
    "every non - tracking string of length @xmath2 can be one of the following : ends with 0 , ends with 01 or ends with 11 .",
    "the number of non - tracking strings of length @xmath2 that end with 0 is exactly the same as the number of all non - tracking strings of length @xmath23 .",
    "if a non - tracking string ends in 11 it has to have two zeroes before 11 , that is , it has to actually end in 0011 .",
    "the number of non - tracking strings of length @xmath2 that end in 0011 is obviously @xmath24 .",
    "the non - tracking strings that end in 01 can be of two types : end in 001 and end in 101 .",
    "if a string ends in 001 , that means the track is just lost and before that there can be any non - tracking string .",
    "that is , the number of non - tracking strings ending in 001 is @xmath25 .",
    "if the non - tracking string ends in 101 it has to have two zeroes before that .",
    "that means it really ends in 00101 .",
    "two zeroes signify the loss of the track and the string can have anything before that .",
    "that means the number of non - tracking strings ending in 101 is @xmath26 . by summing over all the endings",
    "we get the proof .",
    "we proved that @xmath20 .",
    "the sequences are the same , but can we match a specific tournament to a non - tracking binary string ?",
    "prasad tetali @xcite shows us that there are four basic unique tournaments .",
    "their score vectors are : @xmath14 , @xmath17 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 . see figure  [ basic ] for the pictures of unique tournaments .",
    "we can build other tournaments from basic tournaments using the composition operation .",
    "suppose we have two tournaments @xmath29 and @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath0 nodes correspondingly .",
    "we can create a new tournament @xmath32 on @xmath33 nodes in the following manner : the first group of @xmath31 people played with each other according to the tournament @xmath29 .",
    "the second group of @xmath0 people played with each other according to the tournament @xmath30 .",
    "and every person from the second group won every match with a person from the first group .",
    "according to @xcite any unique tournament can be decomposed into basic unique tournaments .",
    "as we are trying to draw a parallel between tournaments and non - tracking strings , we have candidates for building blocks in non - tracking strings .",
    "namely , there are 4 basic strings that we add to an existing non - tracking string to create a new one : 0 , 001 , 0011 , 00101 .",
    "if these strings correspond to basic unique tournaments then we can suppose that one character in a binary string should correspond to one person ( vertex ) in a tournament .",
    "but something is not quite right here .",
    "actually two things are off :    1 .",
    "the index is off  tournaments with @xmath34 people correspond to non - tracking strings of length @xmath2 .",
    "the initial non - tracking sequences ca nt be decomposed into basic strings .",
    "for example , a non - tracking sequence `` 1 '' of length 1 is not a concatenation of basic non - tracking sequences .",
    "now is time for some magic .",
    "let us create a new sequence .",
    "this sequence will be denoted as @xmath35  the sequence of initial - loss non - tracking strings of length @xmath2 .",
    "initial - loss non - tracking strings are non - tracking strings that ca nt have ones in the first and second place . in other words ,",
    "the initial radar observations start by losing the track .",
    "so , we have only one initial - loss non - tracking string of length 1 : 0 .",
    "we also have only one such string of length 2 : 00 .",
    "the number of initial - loss non - tracking strings of length @xmath36 is equal to the number of non - tracking strings of length @xmath37 .",
    "indeed , we can get an initial - loss non - tracking string of length @xmath36 by adding two zeroes to any non - tracking string of length @xmath37 .",
    "any initial - loss non - tracking binary string is a concatenation of strings of 4 basic types : 0 , 001 , 0011 , 00101 .",
    "an initial - loss non - tracking string is a valid non - tracking string . by the proof of lemma [ l : rec ]",
    "if our initial - loss non - tracking string has a length more than 5 , it has to end in a string of one of the basic types .",
    "thus , we can remove all the strings of the basic type from the right of our string until this string has a length not more than 5 .",
    "for the strings of small length we can manually check each one . before starting manual labor let me simplify my life a little bit more .",
    "namely , zeroes at the end of the string are concatenations of the first basic type : 0 .",
    "so , i can only manually check initial - loss non - tracking strings of length not more than 5 ending in 1 .",
    "here is the table providing the decomposition :    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in particular , if the string corresponding to the tournament ends with 0 , we know that there is a champion who won all the matches . on the other hand if the binary string starts with three zeroes we know that there is an absolute loser .",
    "there are several questions for future research :    1 .   what happens if we generalize the sequence to other tracking rules ? 2",
    "can the matching of binary strings to unique tournaments be extended to include other tournaments or other score vectors ?",
    "3 .   can some properties of binary strings be easily described in terms of the corresponding unique tournaments , for example the number of ones in an initial - loss non - tracking binary string ? 4 .",
    "can some properties of unique tournaments be easily described in terms of the corresponding binary strings ?",
