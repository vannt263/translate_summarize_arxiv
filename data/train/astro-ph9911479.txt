    "following paczynski s 1986 proposal , several groups ( eros , macho , ogle ) started systematic photometric surveys in the beginning of the 90s to search for microlensing events due compact objects ( stars , brown dwarfs ) present in the galactic disk , and possibly in the halo .    since the first discoveries @xcite , hundreds of events have been detected in the galactic bulge direction , while only a few events ( @xmath1 ) have been observed toward the magellanic clouds .",
    "the event rates observed toward the magellanic clouds ( lmc , smc ) are significantly smaller than the expected rate from a standard halo , made of brown dwarves ( macho s ) . on the contrary , the large number of events seen in the direction of the bulge @xcite have led to the hypothesis of a barred structure for the galaxy .",
    "this possibility , suggested by de vaucouleurs in 1964 , is now supported by different observations : bulge micro - lensing rate , photometric measurements @xcite , gas and star kinematics @xcite and star counting @xcite .    in order to disentangle contributions from different galactic components ( disk , bar , halo ) ,",
    "eros decided to design and build a second generation apparatus in 1994 .",
    "we briefly describe this setup and our scientific program in the next section .",
    "the marly telescope ( d=1 m , f/5 ) has been specially refurbished and fully automated for the eros-2 survey ( bauer et al .",
    "the telescope optics allows simultaneous imaging in two wide pass - bands @xmath2 ( @xmath3 560 nm ) , @xmath4 ( @xmath3 760 nm ) over a one - square - degree field of vue .",
    "the two focal planes are equipped with ccd cameras , each made of a mosaic of 8 @xmath5 loral @xmath6 thick ccd s , covering a total field of @xmath7 ( right ascension ) @xmath8 @xmath9 ( declination ) .",
    "the pixel size is 0.6 arcsec , with a typical global seeing of 2 arcsec fwhm .",
    "this telescope - camera system has been in operation at the european southern observatory in la silla , chile , since june 1996 .",
    "the observations are carried out for three main scientific programs .",
    "type i supernovae are being used as standard candles to probe the universe geometry .",
    "eros participate in this effort through a powerful automated supernovae search ( @xmath10 ) . around 60 sn",
    "have been discovered in the period 1997 - 1999 .",
    "we were able to determine the type for @xmath11 25 sn , of which 20 have been identified as type ia supernovae .",
    "the mean discovery rate is around 1 sn / 2 hours observing time ( @xmath12 ) .    a small fraction of the eros telescope time is used to search for red dwarves through proper motion detection , while most of the telescope time is devoted to photometric surveys for microlensing searches .",
    "systematic photometric surveys are being carried out in several directions , with typical sampling times of a few days . around 80 fields",
    "are being monitored toward the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) and 10 fields toward the smc . a large area in direction of the bulge is also included in our survey ( cg , @xmath11 150 fields ) as well as 29 fields in the galactic plane , away from the bulge .",
    "the 29 galactic plane fields ( gsa ) are grouped in four directions @xmath13 , @xmath14 and cover a wide range of longitude .",
    "the three year data set discussed here contains 9 million light curves : 2.1 towards @xmath15 , 1.8 towards @xmath16 , 3.0 towards @xmath17 and 2.1 towards @xmath18 . the observation period for these fields span",
    "july 1996 - november 1998 , except for @xmath18 which has been monitored since january 1997 .",
    "the first steps of the event selection criteria require the presence of a single bump , simultaneous in two colors . to reject variable stars",
    ", we require stability of the light curve outside the bump and compatibility with the expected microlensing shape ( cuts on @xmath19 from microlensing fit ) .    detailed description of eros gsa data set and event selection can be found in @xcite .",
    "seven light curves satisfy all the selection criteria and are labeled gsa1 to 7 .",
    "the characteristics for these seven ( 7 ) microlensing events can be found in table [ caract ] .",
    "gsa1 is a large magnification event , while gsa2 exhibit periodic luminosity modulation during amplification .",
    "figure 1a shows the gsa2 light curve which is interpreted as a microlensing effect on a binary source system .",

    "we find an estimated optical depth averaged over the four directions @xmath49 in agreement with expectations .",
    "however , as shown on figure 1 , optical depths or limits computed for each direction indicates a small excess of events toward @xmath16 direction , compared to other directions .",
    "provided that this is not due to a statistical fluctuation , the shorter event time scale toward @xmath16 favors an explanation based on an increased contribution from the bar .",
    "a significant difference in the source stars distance between different targets is another plausible explanation for the observed excess , @xmath16 stars may be located at a larger distance , compared to other directions .",
