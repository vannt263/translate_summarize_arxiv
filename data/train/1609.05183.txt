    "recently there has been much activity in re - examining the role of the cosmological constant , @xmath0 , in gravitational lensing . in 1983 islam , @xcite , suggested that the trajectory of light in schwarzschild - de sitter , henceforth sds , space is independent of @xmath0 .",
    "following his publication , until recently it was generally believed that @xmath0 does not contribute to gravitational deflection of light . in 2007",
    "rindler and ishak , @xcite , considered the role of local angles in a simple setup of gravitational deflection of light in sds space .",
    "they argued that although @xmath0 may not contribute to the orbit of a light ray , it does contribute to its total deflection angle .",
    "rindler and ishak s conclusions immediately led to both enthusiasm and scepticism . among the many responses to their original paper , some authors searched for other ways in which the contribution of @xmath0 emerges , in support of rindler and ishak s conclusions ,",
    "see for example @xcite .",
    "others tried to find errors in rindler and ishak s work and explain the invalidity of their conclusions , @xcite .",
    "up until now there seems to be no clear consensus as to whether or not @xmath0 indeed plays a role in gravitational lensing .",
    "however , the papers that followed @xcite amount to an interesting investigation of the subject , to which we intend to contribute .    inspired by rindler and ishak s work ,",
    "we take a closer look at local ( observable ) angles . specifically , the influence of @xmath0 on observable angles between intersecting null geodesics in sds space .",
    "complementary to rindler and ishak s investigation , we incorporate the general motion of observers into the analysis , and explain in full detail that while @xmath0 may have no direct affect on orbits of light , it can still affect measurements made on them .",
    "we point out some subtle issues that may be a source of disagreement in recent literature .",
    "along the course of our presentation we employ a general formula for expressing observable intersection angles .",
    "this formula is essential in the topic at hand , but quite surprisingly is missing from recent literature .",
    "we also involve the effects of relativistic aberration of light in our discussion , and demonstrate that the general angle formula encompasses this phenomenon .",
    "in fact , the formula can be used to derive an invariant aberration equation , applicable to any background geometry and orientation .",
    "this general equation reduces to the well - known aberration equation as a special case .    employing kottler coordinates ,",
    "we begin by fully examining the dependence of null geodesics and light ray orbits on @xmath0 .",
    "we discuss the role that initial conditions play and how it may influence the conclusions made .",
    "we then digress to derive some general results to help us analyze local angles in the current context of light rays in sds space . throughout our presentation of the topic",
    ", we try to shed light on possible areas of confusion and ambiguity , especially in the use of parameters such as the  impact parameter \" and the  bending angle \" .",
    "we present some expressions of measurable angles in sds space for some specific observers . finally , putting together the concepts of local and global angles we derive the single source gravitational lens equation in sds background .",
    "we compare our work to numerous results from recent publications and discuss the state of the topic so far .",
    "see @xcite for detailed discussions on some of the issues addressed here .",
    "in this paper , we study the role of @xmath0 in the simplest case of lensing phenomenon",
    ". it will serve as a demonstration of the effect of @xmath0 , and as a starting point for further investigation .",
    "consider the spherically symmetric and static metric , with a corresponding line element of the form @xmath1 in the region where @xmath2 . in this manifold ,",
    "the euler - lagrange equations give the following system for the geodesics : @xmath3 where the dot represents differentiation with respect to the affine parameter @xmath4 , and the prime represents differentiation with respect to @xmath5 .",
    "consider a light ray with initial conditions @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "it is important to note that not all of the parameters @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 can be considered independent .",
    "the null geodesic is subject to the condition @xmath12 which means that only three of the @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 can be freely set .",
    "let us concentrate on the case where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the free parameters , and the given set of initial conditions is @xmath13 .",
    "these initial conditions set an event in the manifold and a spacelike direction at the event",
    ". we will refer to them as ` standard ' initial conditions .",
    "furthermore , due to spherical symmetry , without loss of generality we can set @xmath14 and @xmath15 . for such initial conditions we immediately find that @xmath16 , which means that @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , the ray of light is confined to the subspace @xmath18 and the system then reduces to : @xmath19 from , and we obtain the first integral for @xmath5 : @xmath20 our goal is to analyze the influence of the cosmological constant , @xmath0 , on light rays .",
    "we set attention to schwarzschild - de sitter spacetime and make use of the kottler metric , @xcite .",
    "the metric has the form with @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a mass parameter , the effective gravitational mass being @xmath23 , @xcite . with this @xmath24",
    ", we find that @xmath0 gets cancelled out in the differential equations for @xmath5 , leaving @xmath22 as the only metric parameter present . from equation",
    "it follows that the evolution of @xmath25 depends on both @xmath22 and @xmath0 , while from and with , the evolutions of @xmath5 and @xmath26 depend only on @xmath22 and the initial conditions .",
    "we conclude as follows : in schwarzschild - de sitter spacetime , described by the kottler metric , the evolutions of the spatial coordinates of a light ray with standard initial conditions do not depend on @xmath0",
    ". it should be clear that it is a coordinate dependent result , true in kottler coordinates , for rays with standard initial conditions .",
    "we can obtain a first order differential equation in @xmath5 and @xmath26 by using equations and , @xmath27 this equation and its solution ( the spatial orbit ) do not include @xmath0 explicitly .",
    "therefore , we completely agree with islam s remarks on the absence of @xmath0 in @xcite , and with rindler and ishak s position on the issue in @xcite . however , it must be pointed out that islam merely reports of the absence of @xmath0 from the second order differential equation in @xmath28 and @xmath26 .",
    "this absence in the second order relationship is simply not enough to firmly conclude the non - influence of @xmath0 on the orbit .",
    "indeed , we can differentiate in such a way that will eliminate @xmath22 , leaving it absent from the resulting second order equation .",
    ", by setting @xmath28 and differentiating .",
    "notice that by setting @xmath29 instead , we get @xmath30 . ] but this does nt mean that @xmath22 has no influence on the orbit .",
    "it will make its way back to the solution once integration is done and initial ( or boundary ) conditions are applied .",
    "thus , the claim that @xmath0 has no influence on orbits of light entirely based on islam s findings is justly subject to scepticism ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the invalidity of islam s argument was stated explicitly in @xcite . to make this issue finally clear ,",
    "we arrive at the above result from first principles and explicitly state under what conditions it holds .",
    "it is worth noting that for @xmath24 given by , in the combination @xmath31 we have a complete cancellation of @xmath0 .",
    "using approximations that tamper with this combination may affect the cancellation , @xcite .    in the literature on the subject",
    "it is common to make use of the parameter @xmath32 instead of the initial conditions @xmath33 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 in .",
    "@xmath32 is defined as the ratio between the conserved angular momentum and energy of the photon . in terms of our parameters",
    "it can be written as @xmath34 or with @xmath35 treating @xmath32 as an independent parameter in the resulting differential equation leads to the explicit dependence of orbits on @xmath0 .",
    "it is equivalent to treating @xmath8 and @xmath10 instead of @xmath9 and @xmath10 as the independent parameters , as is clear from .",
    "we see that putting @xmath32 in leads to the absorption of @xmath36 , leaving the @xmath0 present in @xmath37 without cancellation .",
    "we note again the importance of specifying the independent parameters of the orbit before making conclusions regarding the influence of @xmath0 on it .",
    "another commonly used parameter is the ` impact parameter ' @xmath38 .",
    "it is related to @xmath32 through @xmath39 and if used in it completely absorbs the explicit appearance of @xmath0 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath0 is not involved in the relationship between @xmath38 and the standard initial conditions either .",
    "if @xmath38 is treated as an independent parameter in the differential equation , the resulting orbits do not depend on @xmath0 explicitly .",
    "again , the dependence of the orbits on @xmath0 is entirely associated with the choice of initial conditions or the parameters used .",
    "we have summarised some sensitive aspects regarding the effect of @xmath0 on light rays in spherical symmetry which were not discussed in recent papers on the topic .",
    "some of the disagreements in papers that followed rindler and ishak s @xcite are related to these aspects .",
    "we present a much more detailed discussion on this in @xcite .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the two traditional definitions of the ` impact parameter ' in schwarzschild space do not coincide in sds space , see @xcite .",
    "this term has been used to refer to both @xmath32 and @xmath38 by different authors ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , which are clearly different quantities for @xmath40 .",
    "we adhere to the geometrical definition , in which the impact parameter is the geometrical distance of an asymptote of the orbit to the origin .",
    "this is found to be @xmath38 with @xmath40 , not @xmath32 , see @xcite .",
    "rindler and ishak , in agreement with islam s claim , have acknowledged that @xmath0 has no influence on the orbit itself .",
    "however , they argued that since @xmath0 affects the global geometry of the space in which the orbit exists , it must have an effect on the orbit s overall bending .",
    "they proposed and demonstrated the use of a new definition for the bending angle of the orbit , which is affected by @xmath0 .",
    "more on this in section [ s4a ] .",
    "other attempts in extending the concept of bending angle to the @xmath40 case were made since .",
    "there is still disagreement between authors on the exact definition .",
    "here we adopt a different approach and make a clear distinction between global and local angles .",
    "we review the purpose of the bending angle defined in the absence of @xmath0 , before attempting its generalization for @xmath40 . keeping in mind that the basic question of theoretical interest here is whether or not @xmath0 affects directly observable angles , and",
    "if so , can its value be determined from such measurements ? in addressing these questions ,",
    "we proceed with a method that allows us to account for the motion of observers making local measurements and , in particular , to study the combined effects of @xmath0 and relativistic aberration on observable angles .",
    "consider a spacetime with a metric @xmath41 of signature @xmath42 , and two null geodesics @xmath43 and @xmath44 that intersect at an event @xmath45 .",
    "in general , for an indefinite metric the angle between two arbitrary vectors is not defined , nor is the intersection angle between our @xmath43 and @xmath44 . however , if we consider a timelike observer at the intersection event @xmath45 , then the measurable intersection angle that takes place in the local frame of the observer has a clear definition .",
    "let @xmath46 and @xmath47 be 4-vectors at @xmath45 tangent to @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively , and @xmath48 be the 4-velocity of an observer at @xmath45 .",
    "the intersection angle , @xmath49 , between the light rays measured by the observer is given by @xmath50 the derivation of this formula is trivial and its importance to the field of gravitational lensing is clear , yet it is not utilized in any of the recent literature on the topic . the formula is known to be used by the gaia team .",
    "we found an explicit appearance of it in @xcite and an implicit form in @xcite .",
    "we were not able to find the formula in books on differential geometry , except for very special cases appearing in @xcite .",
    "also see @xcite .    a simple derivation follows . for a spacetime with a metric @xmath41 of signature @xmath42 , let @xmath46 and @xmath47 be any two 4-vectors at an event @xmath45 ,",
    "each may represent the tangent of an arbitrary curve through @xmath45 .",
    "let @xmath48 be the 4-velocity of a timelike observer at @xmath45 , and @xmath51 and @xmath52 be the projections of @xmath46 and @xmath47 onto the local space of the observer , such that @xmath51 and @xmath52 are spacelike and perpendicular to @xmath48 with respect to the metric @xmath41 .",
    "we easily find that @xmath53 projecting the metric @xmath41 onto the spatial frame of the observer at @xmath45 will give the positive definite ( local ) metric of that space , which must be equivalent to the confinement of @xmath41 to 4-vectors tangent to that spatial frame .",
    "the angle , @xmath49 , between the vectors @xmath51 and @xmath52 that takes place in the observers space is clearly given by @xmath54 using the expressions for @xmath51 and @xmath52 we get @xmath55 this formula gives the measurable intersection angle between any curves with corresponding tangent 4-vectors @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "in the special case where the curves are null geodesics , the formula simplifies to . for more details",
    "see @xcite .    turning back attention to light rays in sds space , we see that although @xmath0 may not affect the orbit in the @xmath56 coordinate plane , the local ( observable ) angles have a clear dependence on both the metric @xmath41 and the motion of the observer @xmath57 , either of which may carry @xmath0 explicitly .    before ending this section",
    ", we consider the connection between formula and relativistic aberration of light .",
    "as it is well known from special relativity , and clearly suggested by , two observers in relative motion will generally measure different angles between two intersecting light rays at an event . for a particular orientation of the motions of the rays and observers ,",
    "the relationship between the two measurable angles , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , is given by the relativistic aberration equation : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the relative speed between the observers .",
    "the derivation of this formula can be found in most texts on special relativity .",
    "the assumed orientation is such that in the rest frame of one observer the direction of travel of the other coincides with the direction of travel of a light ray .",
    "it is advantageous to have a fully general relationship between the measurable angles for any orientation in terms of the four 4-vectors involved .",
    "we can easily obtain such a relationship from .",
    "if @xmath46 and @xmath47 are 4-vectors tangent to the intersecting light rays , and @xmath48 and @xmath62 are the 4-velocities of two observers that measure the intersection angles @xmath49 and @xmath63 respectively , then we have @xmath64 the above is a fully general formula for relativistic aberration that can be used with any metric and any orientation of motion . to see that is a special case of we",
    "can restrict ourselves to the situation where the directions of travel of one the observers and one of the light rays coincide in the local frame of the other observer . in a more technical language",
    ", this special case is summarized by the condition that the 4-vectors @xmath48 , @xmath62 and one of the light rays , say @xmath46 , are not linearly independent .",
    "explicitly , @xmath65 where the constants @xmath66 and @xmath67 are determined from the inner products of the vectors involved . under the conditions @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the special relativistic factor , we find the ratio @xmath72 evaluating the inner products in by using and yields , as required .",
    "this is a coordinate free derivation of the aberration equation .",
    "equations and have a particularly simple form in the small angle limit . notice the effect of the signature of the metric in the derivation and outcome of equation , but not in .",
    "in this section we will begin by clearing up some ambiguity regarding the bending angle parameter and settle on a suitable definition of it . in doing so",
    ", we will consider that the main purpose of this angle in sds will be the same as it is in schwarzschild space , which is to be used in the derivation of the single source gravitational lens equation .",
    "we will proceed by collecting some expressions for local angles and combine the results to produce a single source lens equation in a sds background .",
    "we start by reviewing the concept of ` bending angle ' in asymptotically flat schwarzschild space and proceed to discuss its generalization to sds space .",
    "the bending angle for a symmetric orbit of a light ray in schwarzschild space is defined and calculated in various ways throughout the literature , @xcite . within the different definitions ,",
    "the expressions for the bending angle all coincide . with reference to figure [ fig1 ] , the bending angle is most commonly defined as the angle between the asymptotes of the orbit , @xmath73 , @xcite . for",
    "an orbit with smallest @xmath5 coordinate @xmath74 and impact parameter @xmath32 ( = @xmath38 for @xmath75 ) , the bending angle in schwarzschild space is found to be @xmath76    a natural method to find this expression is to take the limits of @xmath77 in the orbit solution , a method which comes under scrutiny when extending the concept to sds space , @xcite .",
    "although @xmath0 may not affect the orbit itself , with its presence in the metric there is no asymptotic flatness , and the region of interest is bounded by an outer horizon .    in the pioneering attempt to modify the definition of the bending angle for the @xmath40 case in @xcite , the authors pointed out the problem with taking the limit and proposed a definition that involves a local angle .",
    "by using the appropriate metric to express this local angle , they found that @xmath0 appears explicitly in the expression of the bending angle , see equation ( 17 ) in @xcite .",
    "this modified expression reduces to the known bending angle in schwarzschild for @xmath75 and can be viewed as a generalization . in this new definition ,",
    "the observers that could in principle measure the local angle are static , although this is not explicitly stated by the authors .",
    "this definition has been criticized for different reasons , @xcite .",
    "see ishak s et al .",
    "follow - up papers on the topic , @xcite , and further discussion in @xcite .",
    "other authors have proposed adjustments to the bending angle that also result in the explicit appearance of @xmath0 in its expression , e.g. @xcite , most are modifications of the definition in @xcite .",
    "consensus should be reached on an exact definition of the bending angle in sds background .",
    "we recall that a key purpose of the bending angle is in deriving the gravitational lens equation , which is of most practical use .",
    "this is the equation where the explicit appearance of @xmath0 is of most significance .",
    "while the orbital equation , , holds no information about the outer horizon , it properly describe orbits within the horizon on the @xmath56 coordinate plane .",
    "the geometric angle between the asymptotes of a light orbit is the required quantity in the ray trace derivation of the lens equation .",
    "for this reason , we propose that the bending angle will be defined as the geometric angle between the asymptotes of an orbit , in both schwarzschild and sds backgrounds .",
    "the bending angle need not be directly measurable , it is a parameter of the orbit . in particular , with this definition , a symmetric orbit of light on the @xmath56 coordinate plane , will have three related parameters : the closest approach @xmath74 , the impact parameter @xmath38 ( or @xmath32 for @xmath75 ) , and the bending angle @xmath73 . in sds space ,",
    "the angle between the asymptotes of an orbit of light is @xmath78 in summary , the influence of varying @xmath22 and @xmath0 in the situation of interest is depicted in figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] .",
    "the role of @xmath0 in gravitational lensing will be attributed to its influence on the local angles involved in the lens equation .",
    "we base our discussion of gravitational lensing and the assumptions involved mainly on @xcite , but also see @xcite .",
    "the standard setup of source , lens , and observer is depicted in figure [ lensing ] . in principle",
    ", one could use equation to get an exact relationship between the geometric angles @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "but if the source and observer are located in the asymptotic region of the orbit , and all the associated angles are small , then the ` ray - trace ' derivation can be used , @xcite . in this procedure , with reference to the parameters appearing in figure [ lensing ] , we find @xmath81 where @xmath73 is explained in figure [ fig1 ] . for an orbit with large impact parameter @xmath38 , to first order in @xmath82 and the angles , we get @xmath83    we now replace the geometric parameters with measurable ones by using angular diameter distances and equation .",
    "let @xmath48 be the 4-velocity of the observer making the measurements , @xmath46 and @xmath47 be the 4-vectors of the intersecting rays in equation .",
    "then , to first order in angles , the measurable angle @xmath49 is found to be @xmath84 with reference to the small geometric angle @xmath79 on the diagram .",
    "the non - radial velocity components of @xmath48 enter the above through @xmath85 .",
    "exact expressions for @xmath49 and without reference to the geometric @xmath79 are given in appendix [ app : exact ] .",
    "let @xmath86_{m=0}. \\label{lensh}\\ ] ] in the absence of the lens , the position angle @xmath87 , where the observer would have seen the source , is found to be @xmath88 in the cosmological context , the geometric ` distances ' @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 should be replaced with available angular diameter distances .",
    "let @xmath92 and @xmath93 be the measurable angular diameter distances to the lens and source , respectively . adopting the usual definition ,",
    "see for example section 3.5 in @xcite , to the current situation , we find @xmath94 and @xmath95 to first order in the angles .",
    "using , , , and with in , we find to first order in the angles and mass @xmath96 the above is the single source gravitational lens equation for the sds background .",
    "we emphasise that this result can be derived without the use of bending angle at all , or any reference to geometric quantities in figure [ lensing ] ; this alternative procedure is sketched in the appendix [ app : lens ] .",
    "once an observer is set , the remaining @xmath89 , which comes through @xmath97 in , must be replaced with @xmath92 to get the final result .",
    "this is done by solving ( i ) for @xmath89 .",
    "it should be noted that although approximations on angles and @xmath22 have been made , the above result is exact in @xmath0 and the components of @xmath48 .",
    "two specific observers are of interest here .",
    "first , the static observer with @xmath98 , for which we get @xmath99 next , in the cosmological setting , a comoving observer far away from the mass has 4-velocity @xmath100 . in this case , with @xmath101 , we find @xmath102 the above result can be interpreted as the single source cosmological lens equation for sds background , where all the parameters are measurable by a comoving observer .",
    "it is in agreement with the main result in @xcite , see equation ( 29 ) there , which was derived through a different approach .",
    "interestingly , the authors of @xcite conclude that low orders of @xmath0 do not appear in the lens equation , but again we encounter a situation where the choice of parameters strongly affect such conclusions .",
    "the authors of @xcite make use of the angular diameter distance @xmath103 , found to be related to the distances @xmath92 and @xmath93 through ( compare to ( 30 ) in @xcite ) @xmath104 in principle @xmath103 could be measured by a second ( distant ) observer , but in practice it may not be available directly .",
    "if all observations are assumed to be taken at a single point , as in the cosmological setting , then the angular diameter distance @xmath103 must be determined indirectly , from other measurements .",
    "we find a complete cancelling of @xmath0 containing terms from equation when using the angular diameter distance @xmath103 .",
    "but if only @xmath92 and @xmath93 are directly available , then the value of @xmath103 can be established only with knowledge of @xmath0 .",
    "see @xcite for further discussion of @xcite .",
    "we conclude that when expressing the cosmological lens equation in terms of directly measurable parameters , @xmath0 makes an explicit appearance .",
    "an advantage in using kottler coordinates is due to the fact that the problem is largely reduced to the orbital equation , . in this setting , the bending angle and",
    "other geometrical parameters come in handy .",
    "however , a disadvantage is apparent when trying to express angles measured by cosmological observers away from the origin ; an obstacle easily overcame by utilizing formula .",
    "the authors of @xcite dealt with this problem by adopting to coordinates centred at the observer , introducing various complexities to the analysis .",
    "this illustrates the flexibility that the formula adds to the topic .",
    "furthermore , using the kottler metric allows us to closely follow the traditional analysis of lensing by a single source , as in @xcite , and can be extended to produce a multi - source lens equation that models a more realistic situation .",
    "see section 2.2 of @xcite .",
    "other approaches may present a much higher mathematical difficulty .",
    "we leave the derivation of multi - source lens equations for @xmath40 background to future work .",
    "it was a long time ago that the question of what exact role @xmath0 plays in gravitational lensing was asked .",
    "but even in the simplest special case of the problem , until this day , the topic seems to be suffering from ambiguities and disagreements .",
    "in the course of the ongoing investigation it became clear that in order to properly address the problem one must consider the contributions of the metric elements on local measurements , on top of the geodesic equations and the shape of a light orbit , @xcite .    building up on previous work , in this paper we investigated the effects of @xmath0 as well as the motion of observers on local measurements .",
    "it was definitively concluded that @xmath0 does not appear in the orbital equation when considering ` standard ' initial conditions .",
    "we made use of the angle formula to account for observer motion in this topic , demonstrated its connection with aberration , and employed it in the context of gravitational lensing .",
    "the formula allows more flexibility in the analysis and is a needed complement to the orbital equation when using kottler coordinates .",
    "the complexities that arise in defining the bending angle and the impact parameter when @xmath40 were discussed . finally , by combining the concepts we showed that @xmath0 appears explicitly in the single source lens equation for sds background .",
    "the importance of the choice of parameters used in the lens equation and the orbital equation were addressed as well .",
    "in addition to the papers mentioned thus far , see @xcite and some references therein for more on this topic . a more detailed discussion of some of the most cited works on the topic , including @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite can be found in @xcite . beyond extending the analysis to multi - source lens equations , in follow up work we will address magnification effects , red - shift and luminosity distances , time delay effects , other contributing cosmological factors , and discuss how in practice @xmath0 can be measured through gravitational lensing phenomena @xcite .",
