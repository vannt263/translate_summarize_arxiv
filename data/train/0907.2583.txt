    "alternatively , one can apply these limiters inside the root search algorithm . in this case the limiters are applied simultaneously with solving for the lrf densities and the velocity . in every iteration of the velocity root search",
    "the shear and bulk viscous pressure are compared to the values of @xmath238 and @xmath36 at the current time level .",
    "this guarantees that the conditions are always fulfilled , but the drawback is that this is computationally more expensive . in situations where we expect fluid dynamics to give a reasonable description these conditions",
    "need not be enforced .",
    "however , if they are violated only in small regions of space - time , i.e. , few cells or few time steps , enforcing the inequalities can prevent these regions to invalidate the whole calculation .",

    "they all give comparable results and can reproduce the analytic results with sufficiently good numerical resolution .",
    "this gives confidence that any of the schemes forms a good basis to extend the calculation to multidimensional problems as well as to non - zero viscosity . in this work",
    "these extensions are made by using the shasta .",
    "second , the numerical solutions for the ( 1 + 1)dimensional riemann problem with non - zero shear viscosity are shown .",
    "we compare results from the ( 2 + 1)dimensional code to the results from the ( 1 + 1)dimensional code and show that both codes yield , to good accuracy , the same results .",

    "we compare the results from the ( 1 + 1)dimensional azimuthally symmetric code to the results from the ( 2 + 1)dimensional code .",

    "after the membrane is removed , in thermodynamically normal matter  @xcite there is a shock wave traveling into the region with lower pressure , and a rarefaction fan into the region with larger pressure .",
    "the interface between the two regions moves at a constant velocity and is called the shock plateau . in dissipative fluids due to",
    "non - zero viscosity the initial sharp discontinuity will be smeared out and the quantities will change smoothly rather than discontinuously .    in numerical calculations , unless stated otherwise , we have fixed the parameters as follows : the local courant number is @xmath242 , and the comparison is made at @xmath243 fm .",

    "all algorithms reproduce the analytic solution with nearly the same accuracy and numerical artefacts .",
    "in particular , all methods show long - wavelength oscillations which are best visible in the expansion rate , in the region between the rarefaction tail and the shock wave .",
    "the hrcs calculations show a somewhat larger overshoot for the velocity at the contact discontinuity as well as a more diffused shock front compared to shasta with @xmath258 .",
    "we also compared the above shasta result with a calculation with a reduced mask coefficient @xmath259 , shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_01 ] .",
    "this reduction strongly suppressed the unphysical oscillations in the numerical solution , but leads also to more diffusive profiles .",
    "furthermore , with the standard mask coefficient we have used the viscous shasta ( vshasta ) solver with a small physical viscosity @xmath260 and @xmath258 .",
    "this very closely reproduces the @xmath259 results with @xmath261 , especially at the smooth parts of the solution .",
    "therefore , albeit small discrepancies exist at the shock font , we can conclude that our numerical solutions with the reduced antidiffusion mask coefficient have an additional numerical viscosity corresponding to @xmath262 compared to the @xmath263 case .",
    "since all numerical calculations only approximate the exact solution , there is always some residual numerical viscosity in the solution .",
    "in fact , some amount of numerical viscosity is required to stabilize the solution .",

    "any of the non - vanishing shear stress components in the two - dimensional calculations can be used to extract @xmath111 .",
    "the simplest possibility is to use @xmath276 , because @xmath150 is independent of the orientation of the initial state in the @xmath277-plane .",

    "we solved the ( 1 + 1)dimensional riemann problem in the perfect - fluid limit .",
    "this problem has an analytic solution which allowed us to make a definite comparison of performance and accuracy of the different numerical algorithms . for this problem",
    "all the algorithms considered here , i.e. , the nt , kt , and shasta methods , gave very similar results .",
    "all of them could reproduce the analytic solution with a very high precision with sufficiently high numerical resolution .",
    "moreover , with the same resolution the accuracy of the methods was found to be similar , i.e. , none of them showed significantly faster convergence to the analytic solution when the grid spacing was decreased . for this reason we have chosen shasta for all the other geometries as well as for all calculations with non - zero viscosity .",
    "we further studied the effect of the mask coefficient @xmath266 in the shasta .",
    "this numerical parameter controls the amount of numerical diffusion in the algorithm .",
    "it was found that a reduction of the coefficient by 20% from the default value smoothens unphysical sharp structures in the solution , especially in the expansion rate , and at the same time only increases the numerical viscosity by a small amount .    in the case of non - zero viscosity",
    ", the analytic solution to the riemann problem is not known .",
    "however , we have demonstrated earlier that our ( 1 + 1)dimensional code is in good agreement with kinetic - theory calculations  @xcite . in this work",
    "we have first applied both ( 1 + 1) and ( 2 + 1)dimensional cartesian implementations of the code to the same ( 1 + 1)dimensional riemann problem . in this case",
    "we have chosen a non - zero shear viscosity , @xmath272 . if the discontinuity in the initial energy - density profile was chosen to be along one of the coordinate axes , perfect agreement between the one- and the two - dimensional codes was found . in the case where the initial discontinuity was chosen to be along the @xmath269 plane , a slight difference between the two codes near the shock front was found .",
    "the results were shown for a rather large grid spacing @xmath271 fm ; the agreement was found to improve significantly for smaller grid spacing . a similar comparison between the ( 1 + 1)dimensional solution in cylindrical coordinates versus the ( 2 + 1)dimensional solution in cartesian coordinates with cylindrically symmetric initial condition confirmed that our method works well also for problems in more than one spatial dimension .",
    "in this work , we have demonstrated the applicability of fct - shasta to solve the conservation equations of causal relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics simultaneously with relaxation transport equations . in the future",
