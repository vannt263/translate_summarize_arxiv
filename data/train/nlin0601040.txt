    "we consider the _ standard nontwist map _ ( snm ) @xmath3 as introduced in , @xmath4 where @xmath5 are phase space coordinates and @xmath6 are parameters .",
    "this map is area - preserving and violates the _ twist condition _ , @xmath7 , along a curve in phase space .",
    "although the snm is not generic due to its symmetries , it captures the essential features of nontwist systems with a local , approximately quadratic extremum of the winding number profile .",
    "nontwist maps are low - dimensional models of many physical systems , as described in",
    ". of particular interest from a physics perspective is the breakup of invariant tori ( which we alternatively call invariant curves ) , consisting of quasiperiodic orbits with irrational winding number ( see appendix ) , that often correspond to transport barriers in the physical system .",
    "one important characteristic of nontwist maps is the existence of multiple orbit chains of the same winding number . for the snm , in particular , the symmetry @xmath8 guarantees that whenever an orbit chain of a certain winding number exists",
    ", a second chain with the same winding number can be found .    changing the map parameters @xmath9 and",
    "@xmath10 causes bifurcations of periodic orbit chains with the same winding number .",
    "orbits can undergo stochastic layer reconnection ( `` separatrix '' reconnection ) , or they can collide and annihilate . the simplest reconnection - collision scenarios , which involve sequences of collisions between elliptic and hyperbolic orbits of a single pair of periodic orbit chains with the same winding number , have been known since early study of nontwist systems.@xcite in the snm , two _ standard _ scenarios can be distinguished that describe , respectively , the reconnection - collision sequence for a pair of either even or odd - period orbit chains .",
    "a detailed review of these scenarios , as well as a discussion of earlier studies of reconnection - collision phenomena in theory and experiments , can be found in .",
    "as recently reported,@xcite even the simple , non - generic snm can have more than two orbit chains of the same winding number , and thus reconnection - collision scenarios are more intricate than previously expected . to illustrate this , two stages of the odd - period standard scenario",
    "are shown in  .",
    "each of the winding number profiles exhibits two peaks at or somewhat below the winding number of the colliding odd - period orbit , which is marked by the dashed vertical line . between the peaks",
    "lies a recess , i.e. , for any winding number between the lowest value of the recess and the peak values , e.g. , the value marked by dotted verticals , four ( or more ) orbits of that winding number traverse the @xmath11 symmetry line .",
    "similar observations can be made for other symmetry lines .",
    "therefore , whenever a periodic orbit is studied with winding number inside the recess associated with a major odd - period orbit collision , complicated reconnection - collision scenarios are possible , which were called _ non - standard scenarios _ in .",
    "( right ) of two stages of odd - period standard scenario .",
    "the @xmath12-ranges of all plots are identical .",
    "parameters were chosen ( a ) slightly before collision and ( b ) slightly after collision of two major odd - period orbit chains ( winding number marked by dashed lines).,width=288 ]    when two quasiperiodic orbits collide , the winding number profile shows a local extremum and the orbit at collision is referred to as the _ shearless curve_. in previous studies of the snm only the shearless curves invariant under the full symmetry group @xmath13 of the snm ( composed of the symmetry @xmath14 as well as the involutions @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) have been considered . however , as seen in ( b ) , in addition to the central extremum ( here a minimum ) in the winding number profile , other shearless curves ( here marked by the two outer peaks ) may exist .",
    "figure  [ fig : odd](a ) also exhibits peaks , but since the plateau and spike are associated with an elliptic point and the invariant manifolds of hyperbolic points , respectively , rather than quasiperiodic orbits , they do not qualify as shearless _",
    "curves_. from now on , we will refer to the @xmath13-invariant curve as the `` central shearless curve '' and to others as `` outer shearless curves . ''",
    "since the breakup of outer shearless curves has not been studied so far , this will be the focus of our investigation in  .",
    "another consequence of the violation of the twist condition is the occurrence of _ meanders _ , quasiperiodic orbits that are `` folded over '' , i.e. , not graphs @xmath17 . whereas birkhoff s theorem states that such curves can not exist in twist maps",
    ", they can occur in nontwist maps . in the snm , meanders appear between ( in parameter space ) the reconnection and collision of odd - period orbits.@xcite figure  [ fig : odd](a ) shows an example , whereas in fig .",
    "[ fig : odd](b ) , the meander has changed to a graph again . as seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : odd](a ) , the region in which meanders are found corresponds to a recess in the winding number profile .",
    "however , the converse is not true : fig .  [",
    "fig : odd](b ) shows an example where meanders are absent , but still a recess in the winding number profile is observed . to our knowledge",
    ", the breakup of meanders has not been studied previously .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in",
    "we review previous results about the snm relevant to this investigation .",
    "section  [ ssec : nt - ovw ] contains a brief discussion of the parameter space of the snm , in particular the details of where the scenarios studied in this paper occur .",
    "section  [ ssec : breakup ] contains an account of how greene s residue criterion is used for detecting the breakup of critical invariant tori .",
    "in we discuss the results for the breakup of the central shearless meander of winding number @xmath0 $ ] ( in continued fraction representation ) , while in we consider the breakup of the outer shearless tori of the same winding number .",
    "questions of regularity of these critical tori and a comparison with previous results are addressed in . finally , contains our conclusion and a discussion of open questions .",
    "basic definitions are given in the appendix .",
    "in order to identify the parameter regions where the bifurcations described in occur , various parameter space curves can be computed ( usually numerically ) .",
    "collisions of periodic orbits are described by the _ bifurcation curves _ introduced in and generalized in .",
    "reconnections do not occur precisely on parameter space curves ( see , e.g. , ) , but within a finite range of parameters ; however , the range is usually small enough that the method of ( implemented in ) yields curves that represent a good approximation of the _ reconnection thresholds _ for odd - period orbits . for even - period orbits , reconnection coincides with the collision of hyperbolic orbits .    by numerically computing the _ branching points _ at which bifurcation curves for various higher periodic orbits split up into several branches below a major odd - period orbit collision , one obtains a good estimate of the parameter region for which multiple orbit chains exist . for an extensive discussion of these curves and their computation see .",
    "an overview of parameter space with thresholds for several examples of low - period orbits is shown in .",
    "higher orbit branching points , bifurcation curves , and approximate reconnection thresholds are shown for the odd - period orbits 2/3 and 1/1 .",
    "meanders occur between reconnection and collision ; a recess in winding number profile is encountered in the region limited by branching points and bifurcation curve . for even - period orbits with winding number 1/2 , 5/6 , and 11/12 ,",
    "only bifurcation curves are shown , since even - period orbits do not induce branching and reconnections coincide with collisions . of the corresponding winding numbers ,",
    "no orbits exist above the highest ( in @xmath10 ) bifurcation curve and two orbit chains are found below the lowest one ; in between various numbers of orbits exist on each symmetry line .",
    "in addition , the figure also contains the ragged breakup boundary , introduced in , above which the central shearless orbits have become chaotic .",
    "that `` converged '' without assuming a global maximum or minimum within the sequence ( @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , and @xmath20 ) .",
    "] we further indicate points ( by triangles ) for which the breakup of the central shearless curve has been studied in detail in the past ( see ) as well as the two points investigated in this paper : the central meander from is shown as a solid circle ( @xmath21 ) , the outer shearless curves from as an empty circle ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "note that all breakup points for central shearless tori are located on the breakup boundary , whereas the outer shearless curves break up at smaller parameter values .",
    "the winding number investigated here was chosen such that the central shearless curve is a meander , i.e. , the point @xmath21 is located between the 1/1 reconnection and collision thresholds , and that multiple orbit chains and hence multiple shearless curves can occur , i.e. , the point @xmath22 is located to the right of the 1/1 branching threshold .",
    "this can be ensured by picking a winding number close to a periodic orbit , here @xmath23 , whose bifurcation curve both branches due to a nearby major odd - period orbit , and has one branch crossing a collision threshold of this major odd - period orbit before crossing the breakup boundary .      whereas the breakup boundary in provides a rough estimate of the parameter values at which central shearless tori break , a significantly more precise tool for studying the breakup of a particular torus with given winding number",
    "is provided by greene s residue criterion , originally introduced in the context of twist maps.@xcite this method relies on the numerical observation that the breakup of an invariant torus with irrational winding number @xmath24 is determined by the stability of nearby periodic orbits .",
    "some aspects of the validity of this criterion have been proved for nontwist maps.@xcite    to study the breakup , one considers a sequence of periodic orbits with winding numbers @xmath25 converging to @xmath24 , @xmath26 .",
    "the sequence converging the fastest , and hence the most commonly used one , consists of the convergents of the continued fraction expansion of @xmath24 , i.e. , @xmath27 $ ] , where @xmath28 =    a_0 + \\cfrac{1}{a_1 + \\cfrac{1}{a_2 + \\ldots}}.\\ ] ] the stability of the corresponding orbits can be expressed through their residues , @xmath29/4 $ ] , where @xmath30 is the trace and @xmath31 is the linearization of the @xmath32 times iterated map about the periodic orbit : an orbit is elliptic for @xmath33 , parabolic for @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and hyperbolic otherwise .",
    "the convergence or divergence of the residue sequence associated with the chosen periodic orbit sequence then determines whether the torus exists or not , respectively :    * @xmath36 if the torus of winding number @xmath24 exists .",
    "* @xmath37 if the torus of winding number @xmath24 is destroyed .    at the breakup itself ,",
    "various scenarios can be encountered , depending on the class of maps and invariant torus under consideration .    for twist systems ,",
    "this criterion has been used to study the breakup of noble invariant tori in the standard ( twist ) map , i.e. , orbits with winding numbers that have a continued fraction expansion tail of 1 s ( see , e.g. , ) .",
    "it was found that at the point of breakup the sequence of residues converges to either @xmath38 or a three - cycle containing @xmath39 as one of its elements .    in the standard nontwist map ,",
    "the residue criterion was first used in to study the breakup of the central shearless torus of inverse golden mean @xmath40 $ ] winding number .",
    "there it was discovered that the residue sequence converges to a six - cycle .",
    "similar studies were conducted for noble central shearless tori of winding numbers @xmath41 ( ) and @xmath42 $ ] ( ) , and the same six - cycle was found .",
    "the parameter values at which these shearless tori break , i.e. , at which six - cycles of residues are encountered , are marked by triangles in . in this paper , we study the noble winding number @xmath43 $ ] , where the large number 11 in the second convergent had to be chosen to ensure that the breakup occurs in a region in parameter space where both meanders and multiple shearless tori are possible , as described in .",
    "in addition to nontrivial residue convergence behavior , invariant tori at breakup exhibit scale invariance under specific phase space re - scalings .",
    "all these results suggest that certain characteristics of the breakup of noble invariant tori are universal , i.e. , the same within a large class of area - preserving maps . to interpret the results ,",
    "a renormalization group framework based on the residue criterion has been developed ( see , e.g. , ) .",
    "in order to study a shearless irrational orbit , one needs to locate parameter values on its bifurcation curve .",
    "this can be achieved numerically by approximating them by parameter values on the bifurcation curves of nearby periodic orbits , usually of orbits with winding numbers that are the continued fraction convergents of @xmath24 . for @xmath0\\approx 0.920748351059159504 $ ] , the convergents up to the highest numerically accessible one in our studies are shown in  .",

    "[ cols=\">,<,>,<,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : reg ]    this agrees very well with the regularity of other shearless noble tori studied in .",
    "in this paper we presented the breakup of two types of shearless invariant tori with noble winding number that had not been studied previously : a central meander and an outer torus .",
    "the breakup of the central meander showed within numerical accuracy the same critical residues , scaling parameters , and eigenvalues of the renormalization group operator as the central shearless invariant tori previously studied . from a renormalization group point of view",
    "this was to be expected : all nontwist maps with a critical shearless torus of noble winding number are expected to be equivalent under renormalization to the map with the critical shearless golden mean torus , independent of being a meander or not .    in this light ,",
    "the result of the outer torus breakup is surprising .",
    "although the winding number is noble , no critical residue pattern could be established within the numerically accessible range .",
    "this suggests that the number theoretic properties of the winding number might not be enough for the classification of different breakup scenarios . in the case of nontwist maps",
    "the symmetry properties of the shearless torus ( here : @xmath14-invariant vs. not @xmath14-invariant ) seem to affect the breakup .",
    "it is possible that after an appropriate coordinate change , that will make the outer torus symmetric in those coordinates , the snm with critical outer torus is equivalent under renormalization to the fixed point with critical shearless golden mean torus .",
    "alternatively , this could be the first indication of a new fixed point of the renormalization group operator for area - preserving maps .",
