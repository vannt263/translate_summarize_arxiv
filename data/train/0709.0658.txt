    "negative metallicity radial gradients in the stellar populations are a common feature in spheroids ( either elliptical and bulges , e.g. carollo et al .",

    "2000 , respectively ) .",
    "moreover bulges remarkably follow many other fundamental constraints for ellipticals such as the mass - metallicity and the mass-[@xmath0/fe ] relations , the only difference being that they might be rejuvenated systems ( thomas & davies , 2006 ) . to date , only a handful of observational works inferred the gradients in the [ @xmath1 ratios both elliptical galaxies ( melhert et al .",
    "2003 , annibali et al .",
    "2006 , sanchez - blazquez et al .",
    "2007 ) and galaxy bulges ( jablonka et al . 2007 ) .",
    "these papers show that the slope in the [ @xmath1 gradient can be either negative or positive , with a mean value close to zero , and that it does not correlate with galactic properties ( e.g. stellar mass for elliptical and hubble type of the host spiral for bulges ) .",
    "to date such facts have not been properly addressed by any model of galaxy formation .",
    "we adopted a one - dimensional hydrodynamical model which follows the time evolution of the density of mass , momentum and internal energy of a galaxy , under the assumption of spherical symmetry .",
    "our main novelty is that we follow the chemical evolution of several elements , namely h , he , o and fe .",
    "this set of elements is good enough to characterize our simulated elliptical galaxy from the chemical evolution point of view .",
    "we refer the reader to pipino , dercole & matteucci ( 2007 , pdm ) for a comprehensive discussion of the adopted code and for the description of the models for massive spheroids . concerning the galaxy bulges , instead",
    ", we assume that they are stellar systems with mass @xmath2 embedded in a @xmath3 times more massive dark matter halo .",
    "we neglect the presence of a disc , which requires a much longer timescale to be built .",
    "several initial gas temperatures and density profiles have been tested . in this paper",
    "we show the results for _ fiducial _ model ; this is the one , among all the models we ran , which gives the best match of the milky way bulge .",
    "all the models undergo an outside - in formation as suggested by pipino , matteucci & chiappini ( 2006 , pmc ) , in the sense that star formation stops earlier in the outermost than in the innermost regions , owing to the onset of a galactic wind which proceeds from large radii ( where the potential well is shallower ) to the galactic core .    the mass - metallicity relation is satisfied , since our massive objects have an average metallicity in the stars which is supersolar ( see pdm for details ) , whereas the simulated bulges have solar metallicity at most . at the same time",
    "we also satisfy the relation between [ @xmath0/fe ] and mass ( see e.g. thomas & davies , 2006 ) , being the central region of our massive spheroids more @xmath0-enhanced that those of the bulges .",
    "these relations are in place after 0.5 - 1 gyr since the beginning of the star formation .",
    "it is importan to underline that our findings regarding the build - up of both the mass - metallicity and the [ @xmath0/fe]-mass relations are _ real predictions _ and can be checked by on - coming observational campaigns .",
    "we find [ fe / h ] gradient slope in the range -0.5  -0.2 dex per decade in radius and -0.3 dex per decade in radius for [ z / h ] , in agreement with the observations ( e.g. annibali et al .",
    "once transformed into predictions on the line - strenght indices , these gradients in the abundances lead to @xmath4 mag per decade in radius , again in agreement with the typical mean values measured for ellipticals by several authors and confirming the pmc best model predictions .",
    "the remarkable exception of some model with a steeper gradient seems to go in the direction of a few massive objects in the ogando et al .",
    "( 2005 ) sample .    by analysing typical massive ellipticals",
    ", we find that all the models that show values for their chemical properties , including the [ fe / h ] and the total metallicity gradients , within the observed ranges , show a variety of gradient in the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratio , either positive or negative , and one as no gradient at all .",
    "we find that the predicted variety of the gradients in the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratio can be explained by physical processes , generally not taken into account in simple chemical evolution models , such as metal  enhanced radial flows coupled with different initial conditions .",

    "investigation of a possible dependence between slope and mass will be the subject of a forthcoming paper .",
    "therefore our models suggest the gradient in the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratio to be related to the interplay between the velocity of the @xmath0-enhanced radial flows , moving from the outer to the inner galactic regions , and the intensity and therefore duration of the sf formation process at any radius . in other words , if the flow velocity is fast relative to the star formation , the stars still forming at inner radii have time to form out of @xmath0-enhanced gas coming from the outermost regions , thus flattening and even reversing the sign of the [ @xmath0/fe ] gradient ( fig .",
    "[ fig_esplicativa ] , left panel ) .",
    "moreover , the classical bulges allow us a further tool to calibrate our models .",

    "[ fig_esplicativa ] ( right panel ) we plot the distribution of stars formed out of gas with a given chemical pattern ( i.e. a given [ @xmath6 and [ @xmath7 ) as contours in the [ @xmath7-[@xmath6 plane .",
    "in particular , the contours connect regions of the plane with the same mass fraction of stars .",
    "the dotted - dashed line is the average trend ( which reflects the mean composition of the gas ) , while the symbols are a compilation of observations ( see ballero et al .",
    "we consider the stars born in different points of the grid , which may have undergone different chemical evolution histories .",
    "this explains why the lowest probability contour ( i.e. the outermost ) is quite broad .",
    "in the single degenerate scenario , the minimum timescale for having a snia is 30 myr , therefore we can have stars forming in a cell in which [ o / fe ] @xmath8 even at [ fe / h]=-1.5 , but this is very unlikely .",
    "in fact , remarkably , the majority of the observed data points lie within the highest probability contour . in practice our model",
    "can explain not only the average trend , but also the intrinsic scatter .",
    "_ the minimum time is in general different for the timescale for snia to be effective _ which is tipically inferred from the position of the knee in the [ o / fe ] vs [ fe / h ] curve ( dashed line in fig .",

    "if the exponent x=0.33 is kept constant over the whole mass range predicts too a narrow and peaked stellar metallicity distribution .",
