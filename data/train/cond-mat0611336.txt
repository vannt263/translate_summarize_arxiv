    "polarized transport in spin - dependent nanostructures is a subject of intense study in the emerging field of spintronics,@xcite due to its relevance to the development of novel spin - based devices.@xcite in addition , transport through qds provides information about fundamental physical phenomena in spin - dependent and strongly correlated systems , such as the kondo effect,@xcite the coulomb- and spin - blockade effects,@xcite spin valve effect and tunnelling magnetoresistance ( tmr),@xcite etc .",
    "novel spin filters and pumps have also been proposed using qds coupled to normal metal leads.@xcite a system of particular interest in this context comprises a quantum dot or a metallic grain coupled to ferromagnetic leads .",
    "the ferromagnetism of the leads introduces spin - dependent tunneling rates between the leads and the central region .",
    "this results in a nonzero net spin in the central region for asymmetric magnetization geometries .",
    "this effect is called spin accumulation or spin imbalance.@xcite it has been shown that spin accumulation affects several transport properties , such as magnetoresistance,@xcite ( negative ) differential resistance@xcite and the zero - bias anomaly.@xcite in addition it provides a way to generate and control the current spin polarization via gates or bias voltages,@xcite which is one of the main goals within spintronics .",
    "systems composed of a nonmagnetic lead and a ferromagnetic lead with a quantum dot or a quantum wire as spacer have been analyzed recently .",
    "it was pointed out that if the spacer is a dot and the ferromagnetic lead is half - metallic , a novel mesoscopic current - diode effect arises.@xcite spin - current rectification was also predicted in an asymmetric system composed of a ferromagnetic ( fe or ni ) and nonmagnetic ( au or pd ) contacts coupled to each other via a molecular wire.@xcite additionally , it was pointed out that a nm - qd - fm system can operate as a spin - filter and as a spin - diode.@xcite in ref .",
    "[ ] the authors use the bias voltage to change the resonance position of the dot level with respect to the spin - split density of states of the ferromagnetic lead .",
    "this gives rise to spin - dependent currents .",
    "here we study spin - resolved currents in a single - level quantum dot attached to a nonmagnetic lead (  left lead \" ) and to a ferromagnetic lead (  right lead \" ) , fig .",
    "1 . as we shall show , the magnetic asymmetry between the left and right terminals results in a rectification of the current polarization for a particular bias range for which the single electron channel @xmath2 is on - resonance , and the double - occupancy channel @xmath3 is off - resonance .",
    "more precisely , when the nonmagnetic lead operates as an emitter and the ferromagnetic lead as a collector , defined as the positive bias ( @xmath4 ) , the current is unpolarized .",
    "in contrast , when the ferromagnetic lead is the emitter and the nonmagnetic lead is the collector ( negative bias ) a spin - polarized current arises .",
    "importantly , this rectification occurs only in this particular bias range , as we shall demonstrate both analytically and numerically .",
    "this is attributed to an interplay between nonequilibrium spin accumulation and coulomb interaction within the dot . for high enough bias voltages ,",
    "the current polarization is essentially symmetric with respect to the bias , and no rectification is found .    in the main body of the text",
    "we employ the master - equation approach of glazman and matveev@xcite to describe the spin - dependent transport through the nm - qd - fm junction in the sequential tunneling regime ( @xmath5,@xcite where @xmath6 is a characteristic tunneling rate ) . an alternative description in terms of nonequilibrium green functions",
    "is also presented in the appendix , that corroborates our results obtained via master equation .",
    "the nm - qd - fm system we study is schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "an external bias voltage @xmath7 drives the system away from equilibrium thus imposing a chemical potential imbalance between the left ( l ) and the right ( r ) leads : @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the chemical potential of the lead @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the absolute value of the electron charge ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the system hamiltonian is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the free - electron energy with wave vector @xmath15 and spin @xmath16 in lead @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) , @xmath2 is the spin - degenerate dot level , @xmath19 is the on - site coulomb repulsion and the operators @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) and @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) destroy ( create ) an electron with spin @xmath16 in the lead @xmath17 and in the dot , respectively .",
    "the matrix element @xmath24 gives the lead - dot coupling .",
    "we do not consider any spin - flip processes .    to calculate the current we use rate equations,@xcite which yield @xmath25\\nonumber\\\\ & & + e[\\widetilde{\\g}_{01\\s}^\\eta(n_{\\overline{\\s}}-n_{\\uparrow \\downarrow } ) - \\widetilde{\\g}_{10\\s}^\\eta n_{\\uparrow \\downarrow}],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have assumed @xmath26 .",
    "the parameter @xmath27 corresponds to the rate of adding one electron to the dot coming from lead @xmath17 , and @xmath28 is the rate of moving one electron from the dot to lead @xmath17 .",

    "we approximate @xmath57 , and @xmath58 , @xmath59 for @xmath4 and @xmath60 , @xmath61 for @xmath62 . using this into the occupation and current equations , eqs .",
    "( [ nsfinal ] ) and ( [ ifinal ] ) , we find analytical expressions for the first plateau that appears in the current and its polarization for both positive and negative bias voltage .",

    "the right side current is simply given by @xmath71 for a spin - conserving stationary regime .",
    "equation ( [ closedi ] ) gives the ( bias - independent ) current in the regime addressed here .",
    "for the particular case of spin - independent tunneling rates , i.e. , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , we obtain @xmath74 in accordance with results already known in the literature.@xcite    using eq .",
    "( [ closedi ] ) into the definition @xmath75 , we obtain the current polarization plateau @xmath76 where @xmath64 for @xmath4 and @xmath66 for @xmath62 .",

    "therefore the nm - qd - fm junction functions as a _ current - polarization diode_.",
    "we assume that the dot level depends on the bias voltage according to @xmath82 , where @xmath83 accounts for asymmetric voltage drops along the left and right tunnel barriers.@xcite @xmath84 can be controlled via gate voltages . for the numerics",
    "we take @xmath85 mev , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 @xmath89ev , @xmath90 mev and @xmath91ev.@xcite in secs .",
    "b , c and d we assume a symmetric potential drop across the system with @xmath92 . in sec .",
    "e we briefly discuss the asymmetric case with @xmath93 .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the current polarization as a function of the external bias @xmath94 .",
    "we observe that for positive bias the current polarization decreases for increasing bias , reaching zero around @xmath954 mev .",
    "conversely , for the negative biases we obtain a maximum polarization @xmath96 around @xmath97 mev , confirming the analytical result found in sec .",
    "( [ polresults ] ) .",
    "the voltage range for this behavior scales with the parameter @xmath19 . for high enough bias voltages ( @xmath98 7 mev ) the polarization reaches the same nonzero plateaus for both positive and negative voltages .",
    "both the suppression ( @xmath4 ) and the enhancement ( @xmath62 ) of the current polarization are due to the interplay of coulomb interaction and spin accumulation in the quantum dot .",
    "quite interestingly this interplay affects @xmath1 differently with the bias sign , namely , for direct bias it suppresses @xmath1 while for reverse bias it enhances @xmath1.@xcite the suppression of @xmath1 for positive bias results in the zero polarization seen for all @xmath96 values except @xmath99 . in the half - metallic case ( @xmath99 ) ,",
    "there is only spin up current flowing in the system ( @xmath100 , @xmath101 ) , so the polarization becomes simply @xmath102 . on the other hand , for negative bias , the maximum polarization plateau changes as @xmath96 varies .",
    "in particular , @xmath1 attains a plateau equal to the polarization degree of the ferromagnetic lead , according to eq .",
    "( [ polresults ] ) .",
    "to gain a more detailed understanding of the spin - diode effect we investigate next the spin accumulation @xmath103 and the spin - resolved @xmath104 curves as a function of the bias .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the spin accumulation @xmath105 as a function of the bias voltage , for distinct polarization parameters @xmath96 .",
    "for all the @xmath96 values considered here we note that @xmath106 for positive bias and @xmath107 for negative bias .",
    "this spin - imbalance can be understood in terms of the tunneling rates @xmath37 between dot and leads . due to the ferromagnetism of the right lead ,",
    "the rates @xmath108 and @xmath109 become asymmetric .",
    "for example , for @xmath110 the rates are @xmath111 @xmath89ev , @xmath112 @xmath89ev and @xmath113 @xmath89ev . for positive bias ,",
    "@xmath108 becomes the ingoing tunneling rate for electrons with spin @xmath16 and @xmath109 the outgoing tunneling rate .",
    "due to the inequality @xmath114 , the spin up electrons can tunnel out the dot faster than they come into it .",
    "on the other hand , since @xmath115 , the spin down electrons leave the dot slower than they come into it .",
    "so on average the spin down electrons spend more time in the dot than the spin up ones for @xmath4 , thus @xmath116 .",
    "a similar reasoning applies to the other @xmath96 values , except for @xmath117 for which there is no accumulation . for negative bias ,",
    "@xmath118 and @xmath119 are the outgoing tunneling rates while @xmath120 and @xmath121 become the ingoing tunneling rates . as a consequence of this interchange ,",
    "the spin accumulation inverts its sign @xmath122 . for small @xmath96 values",
    "the spin accumulation is essentially an odd function of the bias , fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .    when @xmath96 increases , though , the imbalance becomes stronger for positive bias .",
    "in particular for @xmath99 , @xmath123 reaches @xmath124 in the positive bias range corresponding to single occupancy ( @xmath125 ) , and a constant plateau for all negative bias .",
    "this happens because no spin - down states are available in the right lead for @xmath99 , so a spin - down electron that enters the dot , coming from the left side ( @xmath4 ) , can not leave the dot to the right side .",
    "hence a spin - up electron can not hop into the dot when @xmath125 , so the accumulation becomes completely spin - down polarized for positive bias . for high enough bias voltages an additional electron with opposite spin can jump into the dot ( for both positive and negative bias ) , thus resulting in a suppression ( in modulus ) of @xmath123 .      in figure [ fig4 ]",
    "we show the spin resolved currents @xmath126 and @xmath127 as a function of the bias voltage for differing polarization parameters @xmath96 .",
    "we observe that for positive bias the spin up and spin down currents coincide in the plateaus indicated by arrows for any @xmath96 value .",
    "this results in the zero current - polarization seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . in the second plateau ,",
    "though , @xmath126 attains higher values compared to @xmath127 , which enhances @xmath1 .",
    "the strong suppression of @xmath126 in the first plateau ( @xmath4 ) is attributed to the spin imbalance @xmath106 observed for the corresponding bias range ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "more specifically , since the dot is predominantly spin - down occupied for positive bias , the spin - up electrons tend to be more blocked than the spin - down ones , thus reducing further @xmath126 and interestingly locking it on top of @xmath127 . in contrast , for negative bias we have the population inversion @xmath107 .",
    "this gives a stronger suppression of @xmath127 as compared to @xmath126 , which enhances the difference between @xmath126 and @xmath127 , and consequently @xmath1 .",
    "when the channel @xmath3 reaches resonance ( @xmath128 mev ) both the @xmath126 and @xmath127 plateaus attain values somewhat closer to each other , thus reducing the current polarization ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .    in particular for @xmath99 the @xmath127 is zero for any bias voltage since there are no spin - down states available in the right lead .",
    "the @xmath126 increases slightly ( for positive bias ) while the dot is becoming populated .",
    "when the population is high enough the coulomb interaction plays a role and the spin up current goes down to zero.@xcite this gives rise to a negative differential conductance at the beginning of the first plateau for @xmath4 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] with @xmath99].@xcite for negative bias ( and @xmath99 ) @xmath126 attains one plateau instead of two steps as for the other @xmath96 values .",
    "this is expected because the spin - down electrons do not participate in the transport in this case , so no coulomb interaction effect arises .",
    "note that for @xmath99 the system can operate as a mesoscopic current diode.@xcite      here we consider the effects of an asymmetric bias drop , i.e. , @xmath130 . as fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows , the asymmetry in the bias drop gives rise to quantitative , but not qualitative changes .",
    "for @xmath131 the current polarization @xmath1 goes to zero much slower with the bias than it does for @xmath92 .",
    "this is so because the resonance condition @xmath132 ( @xmath4 ) , which is necessary to have @xmath133 [ see sec.([analytical ] ) ] , happens for higher bias when @xmath83 decreases . for negative bias the resonance @xmath134",
    "is reached faster ( i.e. , at lower biases as compared with the @xmath92 case ) for decreasing @xmath83 .",
    "this , in turn , translates into a steeper enhancement of @xmath1 which then attains a plateau at @xmath135 [ see eq .",
    "( [ polresults ] ) ] .",
    "in addition , for @xmath131 the zero current - polarization plateau ( @xmath4 ) enlarges while the maximum plateau ( @xmath62 ) shrinks compared to the respective @xmath92 widths . for @xmath136",
    "the resonance @xmath132 ( @xmath4 ) takes place faster with the bias when compared to the @xmath131 and @xmath92 cases .",
    "this results in the steeper suppression of @xmath1 and the shrinkage of the zero current - polarization bias range . for negative biases",
    "the resonance condition @xmath134 for @xmath136 is more slowly attained with the bias as compared to the @xmath131 and @xmath92 cases .",
    "consequently , the polarization @xmath1 reaches the plateau at @xmath135 for higher bias voltages ( in modulus ) .",
    "we propose a nm - qd - fm system which operates as a diode for the current polarization .",
    "more specifically , when double - occupancy is forbidden in the system , i.e. , the channel @xmath3 is far above the chemical potential of the emitter lead , the system carries an unpolarized current for positive bias and a spin - polarized current for negative bias .",
    "this effect is a result of the interplay between spin accumulation in the dot and the coulomb interaction .",
    "interestingly , for positive biases the spin - resolved currents @xmath126 and @xmath127 lock onto the same plateau for a particular bias range , thus resulting in @xmath133 .",
