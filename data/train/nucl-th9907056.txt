    "our knowledge about the nucleon s ground state and its electroexcitation spectrum is largely due to experiments with electromagnetic probes .",
    "the response of the internal degrees of freedom of the nucleon to an external electromagnetic field can be described in terms of structure - dependent polarizabilities . for real photons , these ground - state properties and polarizabilities",
    "can be related to integrals over photoabsorption cross sections by sum rules , which are based on general principles of physics such as relativity , causality and unitarity .",
    "one of the most prominent examples is the gerasimov - drell - hearn ( gdh ) sum rule  @xcite , which provides an astounding relationship between the anomalous magnetic moment @xmath3 of the nucleon and the difference between photoabsorption cross sections for parallel and antiparallel alignments of the photon and nucleon helicities , @xmath4 . closely related to this sum rule",
    "is the forward spin polarizability  @xmath2 , which involves an integral over the same combination of cross sections , but weighted by an additional factor of @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "another example is baldin s sum rule  @xcite , which expresses the sum of the electric and magnetic polarizabilities , @xmath6 , by an integral over the total photoabsorption cross section , @xmath7/2 $ ] .",
    "the use of virtual photons from electron scattering processes provides us with even more detailed information on the structure of the nucleon .",
    "in particular , as we increase the four - momentum of the virtual photon @xmath0 from the real - photon point ( @xmath8 ) to large values of @xmath0 , we can investigate the transition from the nonperturbative to the perturbative regime of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "therefore , the generalizations of real - photon sum rules to virtual photons provide an interesting possibility to study this transition and the varying role of the relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "the general sum rules may be defined in terms of electroproduction cross sections as    ( q^2 ) & = & ^__th d,[sigq2 ] + ( q^2 ) & = & ^__th d  , [ gamq2 ] where @xmath9 is the threshold energy in the @xmath10 frame , @xmath11 the transverse cross section of unpolarized electroexcitation , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the cross sections for the scattering of polarized electrons on polarized nucleons with parallel and antiparallel alignments of the electron and nucleon helicities . in a recent contribution ,",
    "edelmann , kaiser , piller and weise ( ekpw )  @xcite have evaluated such generalized sum rules in the framework of the one - loop approximation to ( relativistic ) chiral perturbation theory ( chpt )  @xcite , supplemented by tree graphs for the excitation of the @xmath14 resonance in the relativistic rarita - schwinger formalism .",
    "unfortunately , a direct measurement of the generalized polarizabilities for @xmath15 is extremely difficult if not impossible , because it requires the extraction of the two - photon exchange contribution to elastic electron - proton scattering  @xcite , the so - called `` dispersion correction '' . on the other hand ,",
    "the polarizabilities of the nucleon at @xmath8 can be directly measured by compton scattering .",
    "they appear as the leading structure - dependent effect in an expansion of the six independent compton amplitudes for small photon energies @xmath16",
    ". however , also real compton scattering is not at all an easy experiment , and therefore the sum rule value of @xmath17 provides a useful constraint to determine the electric ( @xmath18 and magnetic @xmath19 polarizabilities . at present",
    "we have only scarce experimental information on the 4 spin polarizabilities @xmath20 to @xmath21 , except for the sum rule prediction of the `` forward spin polarizability '' @xmath22 , while a complete determination of these observables will require the scattering of polarized photons off polarized protons .",
    "recently , there have been extensive experimental and theoretical investigations of virtual compton scattering ( vcs ) by means of the reaction @xmath23 .",
    "this process involves the absorption of a virtual photon and the emission of a real one . in the limit of long - wave real photons",
    ", this process can also be parametrized in terms of 6 generalized polarizabilities @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "however , the reader should note that vcs is characterized by a transition from a virtual @xmath25 to a real @xmath26 photon , while in the context of our present investigation a generalized polarizability refers to the scattering of a virtual photon with the same 4-momentum transfer @xmath0 in the initial and final states .",
    "the generalized polarizabilities of eqs .",
    "( [ sigq2 ] ) and  ( [ gamq2 ] ) are , of course , constrained by real compton scattering at @xmath8 .",
    "their evolution with increasing values of @xmath0 is of considerable interest for our understanding of the underlying dynamics , because these polarizabilities provide severe constraints to models of the nucleon at low and moderate momentum transfer .",
    "with such a perspective , we shall apply the recently developed unitary isobar model ( uim ) for electroproduction  @xcite to investigate these sum rules in the resonance region .",
    "the uim is based on an effective phenomenological lagrangian for born terms and vector meson exchange in the t channel ( `` background '' ) and the dominant resonances up to the third resonance region . for each partial wave",
    "the multipoles satisfy the constraints of gauge invariance and unitarity , and in the real photon case the results agree well with the predictions of dispersion theory  @xcite .",
    "the model is able to describe the correct energy dependence of the multipoles for photon energies up to @xmath27  gev , and it provides a good description of all experimentally measured differential cross sections and polarization observables .    the uim was used to calculate the spin structure functions @xmath28 and @xmath29 in the resonance region for small and intermediate momentum transfer  @xcite .",
    "the results agree well with the asymmetries and the spin structure functions recently measured at slac  @xcite . moreover , the first moments of the calculated spin structure functions @xmath28 and @xmath29 fulfill the gerasimov - drell - hearn and burkhardt - cottingham  @xcite sum rules within 5 to 10% .",
    "one of the striking features of the generalized gdh integral is its rapid fluctuation with @xmath0 and in particular a change of sign at @xmath30  ( gev)@xmath31 , which imposes severe constraints on any model for the nucleon structure .",
    "this zero - crossing separates the region dominated by resonance - driven coherent processes from a region of essentially incoherent scattering off the nucleon s constituents .",
    "a similar zero - crossing is predicted by chpt for the generalized spin polarizability , @xmath32  @xcite , while we shall show that the uim excludes such a cross - over for @xmath33(1 gev)@xmath31 .    in the next section we review the basic elements of the uim ,",
    "set the notation and definitions for cross sections and generalized polarizabilities .",
    "our results are compared with chpt in section  [ sec3 ] , and our conclusions are presented in section  [ sec4 ] . finally , some details of the formalism are given in the appendix .",
    "in this section we set the notation and summarize the main ingredients of the uim  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath34 and @xmath35 denote the energies of the electron in the initial and final states in the _ lab _ frame and @xmath36 the four - momentum of the virtual photon .",
    "the polarization vector of the target nucleon has the components @xmath37 ( in the direction of the three - momentum of the virtual photon @xmath38 ) and @xmath39 ( perpendicular to @xmath38 , in the scattering plane of the electron and in the half - plane of the outgoing electron ) .",
    "the differential cross section for exclusive electroproduction is then expressed in terms of the 4 virtual photoabsorption cross sections @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 by  @xcite = ( , q^2 ) , [ eq1 ] where = _ t + _ l + hp_x   _lt + hp_z_tt , [ eq2 ] with =   , [ eq3 ] the flux of the virtual photon field , @xmath44 the transverse photon polarization , and @xmath45 the @xmath10 energy of the virtual photon . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the flux is defined by the `` photon equivalent energy '' @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the total c.m .",
    "energy and @xmath48 the mass of the target nucleon .",
    "we caution the reader that this definition due to hand  @xcite is not unique .",
    "in particular many authors use the definition @xmath49 , which has been originally proposed by gilman  @xcite . while both definitions agree at the real photon point , where they describe the @xmath10 momentum of the real photon , they differ in the case of electron scattering .",
    "since the differential cross section should be independent of the choice of @xmath50 or @xmath51 , a change of definition leads to an additional @xmath0-dependent factor @xmath52 for the virtual photon absorption cross sections of eq .",

    "the dominant contributions to the @xmath53 and @xmath54 cross sections , related to the single pion electroproduction , can be obtained by numerical integration of the corresponding differential cross sections , which are expressed in terms of the standard cgln amplitudes @xmath63  @xcite . in the uim",

    "part of the deviations might be attributed to the contribution of the deep inelastic domain , which is included in the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite but not in our result .",
    "we also found a discrepancy of about @xmath78 in the numerical calculation of the dispersion integral in the threshold region ( @xmath79 gev ) .",
    "using the same set of pion photoproduction multipoles of ref .",
    "@xcite , we obtained @xmath80 and @xmath81 instead of @xmath82 and @xmath83 as quoted in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as may be seen from table  i , the born terms are by far the major contributor to @xmath73 , followed by the @xmath14 resonance and multipion production .",

    "in particular in the case of the proton , our background contribution is 50  % larger than the pion - loop contribution of ref .",
    "@xcite , and our @xmath71 contribution is only 25  % of the value of that reference .",
    "in fact we also find a large value for the @xmath14 alone , @xmath86 @xmath77 ( see fig .",
    "however , the interference with the background reduces this value to 2.04@xmath87 @xmath77 ( see table  i ) .    in the case of the spin polarizability @xmath2 , there also occurs a big cancellation between the `` background '' ( essentially s - wave pion production near threshold ) and the @xmath14 , while all other contributions are found to be extremely small , because of the damping factor @xmath88 in the integrand of eq .",
    "( [ gamq2 ] ) . in the neutron channel , this cancellation is almost complete and @xmath89 is practically zero . due to the @xmath88 damping factor",
    "we expect the contributions of the deep inelastic region to be small as well .    as in the case of the gdh sum rule ,",
    "the spin polarizability @xmath2 is very sensitive to an exact treatment of the @xmath90 photoproduction multipole in the threshold region  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the value of @xmath2 is almost entirely given by the contributions of the multipoles @xmath90 and @xmath91 , which contribute with opposite signs .",
    "the predicted values of the uim , ^p & & -0.6 10 ^ -4 ^4 , + ^n & & 0 10 ^ -4 ^4 , are much smaller ( in absolute value ) than the ones obtained from the said multipoles  @xcite , and relativistic chiral perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that the results of relativistic chpt  @xcite are not based on a systematic expansion in @xmath92 .",
    "we also point out that our value for @xmath93 carries a sign opposite to the prediction of heavy baryon chpt  @xcite .",
    "this is a rather intriguing result , since this theory does indeed provide a systematic expansion in @xmath92 .",
    "similarly as in the case of @xmath73 , for which the theory obtains a much too large value , the reason for this shortcoming might be due to large loop corrections in fourth order @xmath94 , which have been neglected in the @xmath95 approximation of ref .  @xcite .",
    "we further record that a recent calculation based on the chiral soliton model  @xcite predicted @xmath96  fm  @xmath97 .",
    "the values for the spin polarizabilities predicted from the uim are in good agreement with the results of refs .",
    "@xcite , obtained on the basis of the hdt multipoles  @xcite .",
    "these multipoles are generated by dispersion relations at fixed @xmath98 , and they provide an excellent description of the photoproduction data for @xmath99  mev  @xcite . in particular , these multipoles are also in agreement with the low energy theorems  @xcite .",
    "next , we present our results for the generalized polarizabilities . in fig .  1 , we show the evolution of @xmath100 for ( a ) the proton and ( b ) the neutron . clearly seen in the figure",
    "are the large individual contributions of the born terms and of the @xmath14 .",
    "it should also be noted that the contribution of multipion production can not be neglected .",
    "2 shows our predictions for @xmath32 for ( a ) the proton and ( b ) the neutron . as in the case of real photons ,",
    "the main contributions are from the born terms and the @xmath14 , and there occur large cancellations between these two contributions .",
    "the higher resonances as well as @xmath62 and multipion production are quite negligible due to the weighting factor @xmath101 in the integrand .    in fig .",
    "3 we compare the predictions of the uim ( solid lines ) and relativistic chpt ( dashed lines ) for the generalized polarizabilities . as can be seen ,",
    "there are significant , qualitative and quantitative , differences between the uim and chpt predictions .",
    "the most striking difference refers to the slope of the @xmath32 close to the real photon point . with increasing values of @xmath0 , the uim prediction for",
    "the background drops much faster than the @xmath14 contribution , and as a result a steep slope develops for @xmath102  ( gev)@xmath31 .",
    "relativistic chpt on the other hand , predicts a rather flat behavior in this region .",
    "the pronounced slope in @xmath32 observed in the uim is due to the interference between background and @xmath14 terms , as we shall explain later .    in fig .  4",
    ", we show the individual contributions of the background ( dotted lines ) , the @xmath14 _ only _ ( dashed lines ) , and the interference between background and @xmath14 ( dash - dotted lines ) . the sum of these three contributions is given by the solid line .",
    "the big destructive interference between background and @xmath14 contributions to @xmath100 and @xmath32 is now immediately visible , and the pronounced slope of @xmath32 near the origin is seen to result from the interference term .",
    "it is interesting that we do not find a zero - crossing for @xmath103 and @xmath104 in the range of @xmath105  ( gev)@xmath31 , while ref .",
    "@xcite predicts such a crossing at @xmath106  ( gev)@xmath31 . in our previous work",
    "@xcite , we found that the uim gives a zero - crossing at @xmath107  ( gev)@xmath31 for the gdh integral @xmath108 which is similar to @xmath2 but with a weighting factor @xmath109 in the integrand and an extra term proportional to @xmath42 ( whose contribution is small for @xmath110  ( gev)@xmath31 ) .",
    "the origin of this phenomenon is the cancellation between the ( negative ) contribution from the @xmath71 resonance and the ( positive ) contributions from the higher resonances and @xmath62 plus multipion channels .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath62 plus multipion channels becomes more and more important with increasing @xmath0 , with the eventual result of a positive value for the gdh integral .",
    "however , as we have pointed out before , the @xmath62 plus multipion channels are more strongly suppressed in the case of @xmath2 than for the gdh integral .",
    "therefore , the zero crossing of @xmath2 does not appear at low values of @xmath0 .",
    "numerically we find that @xmath93 changes sign at @xmath111  1.4 ( gev)@xmath31 , and @xmath112 at @xmath111 2  ( gev)@xmath31 .",
    "as a final remark , we mention that the discussed interference between background and @xmath14 terms originates from the _ dynamical _ dressing of the @xmath113 vertex , which is pictorially shown in fig",
    ".  5 . the main mechanism to renormalize the @xmath113 vertex is diagram  5(b ) , because this diagram has a strong imaginary part .",
    "as is obvious from the optical theorem , this imaginary part individually leads to a strong interference term . in our calculation of pion production",
    "such contributions appear naturally in the expressions for the differential cross sections .",
    "we evaluated the generalized baldin sum rule @xmath100 and the spin polarizability @xmath32 for small and moderate values of @xmath0 using the unitary isobar model ( uim )  @xcite .",
    "both @xmath100 and @xmath32 are dominated by background and @xmath14 resonance contributions .",
    "in addition @xmath100 also receives sizable contributions from multipion processes .",
    "our predictions were compared with a recent calculation in the framework of relativistic chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) . while the total value of @xmath57 agrees well with the result of chpt and other phenomenological calculations , we differ from chpt in the case of @xmath114 .",
    "although one has to recognize that the predictions of relativistic chpt are not based on a consistent @xmath92 expansion , the agreement with the phenomenological result based on the said multipoles sp97k , has been taken as some assurance of the convergence of the expansion .",
    "however , as was remarked earlier  @xcite , these said multipoles did not describe the threshold dependence of the @xmath90 photoproduction multipole but were at variance with the low energy theorems .",
    "we repeat that the correct threshold behavior of the multipole @xmath90 is extremely important for both @xmath2 and the closely related gdh sum rule .",
    "we also found significant , qualitative and quantitative , differences between the uim and chpt predictions for the evolution of @xmath57 and @xmath2 with momentum transfer .",
    "the most important qualitative difference concerns the absence of the interference between background and @xmath14 resonance in ref .  @xcite .",
    "while this interference does not lead to big effects for the net value of @xmath100 , it has a dramatic effect for @xmath32 , in particular for @xmath102  ( gev)@xmath31 .",
    "the physical origin for the interference is the dynamical dressing of the @xmath113 vertex  @xcite .",
    "we are looking forward to experimental tests of our predictions by polarized electroproduction cross sections , which will become available in the near future .",
    "there are indeed quite a few proposals in several laboratories throughout the world to perform such experiments , e.g. at jefferson lab , elsa and mami .",
    "the experimental data presently available do not allow a very precise determination of many ingredients of the uim . among the most important ones ,",
    "is the relative contribution of background and resonances to the multipoles .",
    "while the pseudovector born terms are well described , additional background contributions are model dependent , such as loop effects , pion rescattering or u - channel resonances .",
    "the common feature of such effects is that they are weakly energy dependent and visible mostly in s waves .",
    "as far as the existing data are concerned , they are well described by the uim , which is constrained by unitarity and gauge invariance .",
    "therefore , the uim should provide a reasonable first estimate for the sum rules . of course",
    ", it is only with the availability of new experimental data in the near future that models like the uim can be firmly tested .",
    "such data will certainly enhance our knowledge on various aspects of nonperturbative qcd in general and , in particular , on the low energy spin structure of the nucleon .        in this appendix",
    "we give the expressions of the single - pion electroproduction cross sections @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath42 in terms of the standard cgln amplitudes @xmath115 .",
    "the definition of these amplitudes is the same as in ref.@xcite . within the uim",
