    "galaxies formed a significant fraction of their stars during violent interactions and mergers , as probed by observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and numerical models ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the strongest bursts of star formation are produced by major mergers of equal - mass galaxies @xcite , while the star formation ( sf ) activity rapidly decreases with increasing mass ratio @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the overall contribution of mergers to the sf budget of galaxies remains uncertain and quiescent star formation in isolated systems could dominate @xcite . in general ,",
    "merger - induced sf is assumed to be centrally - concentrated , and to fuel the formation of bulges and compact spheroids rather than extended disks @xcite .",
    "the mechanism usually invoked to explain merger - induced starbursts is that the interaction with a companion induces an asymetry in the gas response , such as strong spiral arms and extended tidal tails , and the gas subsequently undergoes gravity torques .",
    "inside the corotation radius , usually a few kpc , these torques are negative and the gas flows inwards : the density rapidly increases in the central regions , and so does the star formation rate .",
    "the mechanism was first detailed by @xcite , and the resulting sfr were quantified in simulations by , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite : the sfr in a merging pair can increase by a factor of a few tens compared to the same galaxies in isolation , but the increase is generally much more modest  typically a factor of a few units compared to isolated disks @xcite .",
    "a fundamental and general observational fact about interacting galaxies is that their star formation proceeds in giant molecular clouds and star clusters , which can be 10 - 100 times more massive than in normal spiral galaxies , leading in particular to the formation of super star clusters ( sscs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a theoretical explanation is proposed to be an increased gas turbulence @xcite , so that the jeans mass , which sets the typical mass of gas clouds , becomes larger while the free - fall time of these gas clouds decreases .",
    "this mechanism of massive gas clouds formation could trigger the sf activity of interacting galaxies , independently of the traditional central inflow mechanism .",
    "however , most existing models of galaxy mergers , in particular those studying the sf activity , do not resolve clustered star formation in dense cold gas clouds : star formation is instead treated as a relatively smooth process ( at least at scales of 100 - 1000  pc ) , taking place in a relatively homogeneous ism supported by thermal pressure instead of a cloudy ism supported by turbulent motions .",
    "star cluster formation is then only indirectly modeled using sub - grid recipes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is caused by a limited spatial and mass resolution , and/or the absence of model for gas cooling below @xmath4  k in many cases .",
    "only a few models of galaxy mergers can directly resolve cold gas clouds and clustered sf ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but the properties of merger - induced sf were not studied .    in this paper , we present adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) hydrodynamic simulations of a major galaxy merger .",
    "our models have a maximal spatial resolution of 12  pc , and a refinement strategy ensuring that gas can cool down to a few 100  k. gas fragmentation into dense clouds and star formation therein can thus be directly captured , at least down to masses of @xmath5 m@xmath6 .",

    "a realistic multiphase ism with dense clouds embedded in a warmer phase naturally arises in similar models of disk galaxies @xcite .    using this model for a merger of two galaxies with the interaction orbit of the antennae galaxies , we study the interaction - induced sf properties and compare to lower - resolution simulations with a smoother , warmer ism .",
    "we show that the process of gas fragmentation into massive clouds and rapid star formation therein dominates the merger - induced activity , while gas inflows become less efficient when a clumpy multiphase ism is modelled .",
    "these results suggest that merger - driven sf does not follow the processes revealed in lower resolution simulations .",
    "consequences include a potentially stronger starburst , but also a more extended distribution of gas and sf . with these new properties of merger - induced sf",
    ", our model can explain the properties of the antennae galaxies .",
    "we also propose an interpretation for the different sf efficiencies observed in quiescent disks and active mergers @xcite .",
    "we use the amr code ramses to evolve the dark matter and the stellar component using a particle mesh solver , and the gas component using a second - order godunov scheme @xcite . throughout our study",
    ", we model star formation with a schmidt law : the local star formation rate is @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the free - fall time computed at the gas density @xmath9 .",
    "the efficiency of star formation is controlled by the parameter @xmath10  % .",
    "star formation occurs only in dense enough regions ( molecular clouds ) , defined by the gas density @xmath11 being greater than some threshold value @xmath12 .",
    "these two main parameters are usually calibrated using observations of nearby galaxies and the so  called kennicutt - schmidt ( ks ) law .",
    "the real efficiency is high with a high threshold , but models with a limited resolution have to use a low threshold combined with a low efficiency @xcite , which globally reproduces the same ks law @xcite .",
    "+     the global sfr in our model ( like most others ) can be computed directly by integrating the schmidt law over the gas density pdf above the threshold @xmath12 .",
    "the problem therefore boils down to predict the pdf evolution during the merger process .",
    "as shown by several authors @xcite , the multiphase structure of the ism is built up from complicated processes , involving radiative losses ( ultraviolet and infrared line cooling , molecular and dust cooling ) as well as various heating mechanisms ( cosmic rays and uv heating , supernovae and stellar feedback ) and of course self - gravity .",
    "surprisingly , numerical experiments have shown universal properties for the gas density pdf in isolated galaxies , with log - normal or power law distribution shapes .",
    "this was explained as a fundamental property of isothermal ( or dissipative ) self - gravitating turbulence . in this paper ,",
    "our goal is to resolve this supersonic turbulence to compute self - consistently the density pdf and the resulting sfr in the course of a galaxy collision .",
    "we use for that purpose a simple thermodynamical model mimicking gas cooling due to a detailed balance between atomic and fine structure cooling and uv radiation heating from a standard cosmic radiation background @xcite . assuming solar metallicity , we have computed the equilibrium temperature as a function of gas density to define our polytropic equation of state ( eos ) @xmath13 . for densities between @xmath14",
    "h / cc and @xmath15  h / cc , our model has @xmath16  k , while above @xmath15  h / cc , we have @xmath17  k. in this derivation , we neglected self - shielding of the radiation by the gas : gas cooling at very high density may have been underestimated , but we have also neglected the effect of local radiation sources such as ob stars as additional heating sources . although our thermal model appears rather uncertain , it provides a reasonable route of gas dissipation , maintaining the gas temperature to a realistic average value at a given density .",
    "this eos - based model produced a log - normal gas density pdf in isolated galaxies similar to the results of complete cooling / heating calculations ( see section  [ sec : results ] ) and a realistic density power spectrum of ism substructures @xcite .",
    "another important ingredient is the thermal support added at small scales to avoid artificial fragmentation @xcite . to ensure that the jeans length is always sampled by at least 4 cells , we add an artificial pressure defined as @xmath18 .",

    "although the pre - merger isolated disks have similar sfrs , the global sfe during the mergers is totally different depending on the resolution , i.e. depending on whether we model a smooth and warm ism or a cloudy multiphase ism at high resolution .",
    "sfrs are discrepant by a factor of @xmath5310 after the first pericenter and @xmath535 in the final merger stages .",

    "an @xmath54 mode excited by tidal torquing is still visible , but the clumpy gas builds a much more modest central density peak than the low - resolution model : star formation is now spread over 2  kpc ( fig .",

    "the gas response to the interaction is actually dominated by fragmentation in many dense clouds scattered along the spiral arms , with a classical `` beads on a string '' morphology ( see fig .  [",

    "these high clump masses result from the gas turbulent motions , which are increased by the interaction , as already studied in @xcite .",

    ", the gas density pdf strongly evolves towards very high densities in the high - resolution model ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : pdf ] ) , and this evolution if achieved rapidly after first pericenter passage , and with little changes in the later stages : the star formation rate follows this evolution driven by ism fragmentation in massive and dense clouds .",
    "the low resolution model produces an artifically stable ism and does not resolve this process .",
    "the gas response is dominated by the gradual inflow of gas towards the nuclear region with a timescale of a few @xmath62  yr ( while dense gas clumps formed in a few @xmath63  yr ) .",
    "the associated density pdf increases slowly and continuously towards higher and higher densities as a result of the increasing gas concentration .",
    "this is why this model produces slower and more centrally - concentrated star formation than the high - resolution model .",
    "note that our high resolution model do not resolve the clumpy ism in the pre - merger isolated discs .",
    "this could affect our global sfr calibration in the initial conditions , but the initial gas density pdf would look very similar , except for the highest density tail .",
    "although merger - induced star formation in our model is not primarily driven by an inflow of gas , and less concentrated than in earlier models , it remains relatively concentrated near the center of the merging systems ( fig .",
    "3 ) : there is still a tidally - induced inflow , and the central regions are denser and more prone to star - forming instabilities .",
    "this is consistent with star formation in ulirgs being in general centrally concentrated ( assuming ulirgs are mergers ) .",
    "nevertheless , our model also explains that the interaction - induced star formation can also be , for a part , radially extended ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sfrprof ] ) .",
    "this can explain why a number of interacting galaxies actually show extended star formation with sscs forming at several kpc from their center , such as arp  140 @xcite and the antennae @xcite .    as for the antennae , the orbit of which is matched by our simulation , there is a general consensus that we are witnessing the merger close to the second pericenter passage , when the two disks are still well separated @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to an epoch close to 450  myr in our simulation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : antennae ] ) .",

    "( 2010 ) and with the observed sfr ( zhang et al .",
    "karl et al .",
    "( 2010 ) then proposed that this high sfr and the extended sf in the antennae results from the system being observed just at the particular instant of overlap between the two disks .",
    "our high resolution model , however , shows that high sfr around 20  m@xmath1  yr@xmath56 and relatively extended sf can be produced during a longer period ( 300  myr ) and does not require the system to be observed at a particular and brief instant .",
    "observations suggest a dual law for star formation , where the integrated gas consumption timescale ( @xmath64 ) is relatively low for quiescent star - forming disks , and higher for starbursting ulirgs and smgs ( likely major mergers ) , as pointed out independently by @xcite and @xcite . to compare our models with these observations",
    ", we retrieved integrated properties such as half - light radii , total gas mass and total sfr at several instants .",
    "the low - resolution model , where the starburst is driven only by the central gas inflow , does not show the observed change in @xmath64 : the sfr increases during the merger , but only in proportion corresponding to the increase in the global gas density @xmath65 , and this model remains close to the standard relation for isolated disks ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ks ] ) .",
    "the high - resolution model has its starburst driven mostly by increased gas turbulence and fragmentation .",
    "the gas density increases mostly on small scales in dense clumps throughout the system : this process does not affect the total effective size of the gas component , so the observable global density @xmath65 has only a modest increase .",
    "at the same time , the starburst is even stronger than in the low - resolution model .",
    "this processes brings our model in agreement with the `` starburst vs. quiescent ks law '' pointed out by observations , throughout the duration of the merging process . clustered star formation in high - resolution merger models",
    "can also affect the final structure of the resulting early - type galaxies ( bois et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "we thus propose that these recent observations unveiled a `` starburst regime '' where the efficiency of star formation on small scales and at high densities is unchanged , but exacerbated gas turbulence and fragmentation into massive clouds result in faster gas consumption and higher integrated sf efficiency .",
    "the adopted sf law inside the clouds is not the key ingredient in the interpretation , the main effect being the rapid evolution of the density pdf .",
    "different star formation models can indeed lead to different quantitative predictions , but the main qualitative change comes from resolving the high density tail of the pdf @xcite .",
    "previous models of galaxy mergers did not resolve ism turbulence and clouds , and could not unveil the physical processes driving this starburst mode .",
    "the actual process of star formation in starbursting mergers can not be captured with sub - grid models on scales larger than 100  pc , and requires clustered star formation in a multiphase ism to be directly resolved .",
