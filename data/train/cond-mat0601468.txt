    ", other magnetic materials such as fe@xmath9o@xmath10  @xcite and cro@xmath11  @xcite were also found to be half - metals .",
    "half - metallic materials are characterized by the coexistence of metallic behaviour for one electron spin and insulating behaviour for the other .",
    "their electronic density of states is completely spin polarized at the fermi level , and the conductivity is dominated by these metallic single - spin charge carriers . therefore , half - metallic materials offer potential technological applications such as a single - spin electron source , and high - efficiency magnetic sensors  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we search for another kind of hm materials with first - principles calculations . in a hm material ,",
    "the spin magnetic moment per unit cell is quantized , i.e. , an integer number times bohr magneton ( @xmath12 ) .  @xcite it may occur that this integer for some hm materials is zero",
    "this situation has been called half - matellic antiferromagnetism .  @xcite most properties such as full spin - polarized conduction electrons , zero spin susceptibility , and no stoner continuum , of these hm antiferromagnts ( afm ) are the same as those of the hm - fms discussed above  @xcite",
    ". however , there is one important difference : a hm - afm produces no macroscopic magnetic field .",
    "therefore , a hm - af could support 100% spin polarized charge transport without any net magnetization .",
    "furthermore , since there is no symmetry operation ( translation plus spin flip ) that connects its spin - up and spin - down bands , a hm - afm is qualitatively different from a conventional afm such as bcc cr . because of their unique properties mentioned above , hm - afms",
    "have recently attracted considerable attention .",
    "furthermore , they could be used as , e.g. , a probe of the spin - polarized scanning tunneling microscope without perturbing the spin character of samples .",
    "the hm - afms are expected to play a vital role in the future spintronic devices which utilize the spin polarization of the carriers .",
    "the first hm - afm was proposed by van leuken and de groot  @xcite on the basis of the heusler compound v@xmath13mnfe@xmath14sb@xmath13 in . due to the complexity of this material",
    ", considerable effort has been spent to come up with other candidate materials , which may be easier to synthesize . in particular ,",
    "based on extensive first - principles band structure calculations for double - perovskite - structutre oxides la@xmath15o@xmath1 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are transition metal ions , pickett  @xcite proposed the cubic double perovskite la@xmath11vmno@xmath1 to be a promising candidate for a hm - afm . in this case ,",
    "v and mn have antiferromagnetically aligned magnetic moments and they exactly cancel each other .",
    "this finding was borned out by the assumption that both mn and v ions are trivalent and more importantly , all mn@xmath16 ions are in a low spin state of @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "more recently , park , _ et al . _",
    "@xcite suggested thiospinel systems mn(crv)s@xmath10 and fe@xmath19cu@xmath19(v@xmath19ti@xmath20)s@xmath10 as possible hm - afms , based on their electronic structure studies . in ref .",
    ", the mixed - cation double perovskites la@xmath21vruo@xmath1 ( @xmath21 = ca , sr , and ba ) were suggested to be candidates for hm - afs .",
    "androulakis , _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have synthesized la@xmath11vmno@xmath1 samples which , however , has cubic , partially ordered double perovskite structure .",
    "furthermore , it exhibits ferrimagnetic ( fim ) behavior rather than antiferromagnetic one , with mn and v being trivalent and with mn being in high spin state .",
    "therefore , to date , there has been no successful experimental realization of the hm - afm , though it has been speculated in refs .   that ordered mixed - cation double perovskites @xmath22o@xmath1 would be promising candidates for the hm - afm .    motivated by the theoretical and experimental works mentioned above , we have taken a rather thorough search for hm - afms among the mixed - cation double perovskites la@xmath2o@xmath1 . unlike the previous theoretical effort  @xcite",
    ", we have not only performed electronic structure calculations for a fixed crystal structure but also carried out full structural optimizations including lattice constants and atomic position relaxations .",
    "we believe that the structural optimizations would be important .",
    "in particular , though la@xmath11vmno@xmath1 was predicted to be a hm - afm in ref .",
    ", it was found to be ferrimagnetic in a partly ordered double perovskite structure  @xcite .",
    "we have explored a variety of pairs @xmath6 with @xmath3 and @xmath4 from 3@xmath5 ( v , cr , co , ni ) , 4@xmath5 ( mo , tc , ru , rh ) and 5@xmath5 ( w , re , os , ir ) transition metals .",
    "fortunately , we find double perovskites la@xmath0voso@xmath1 and la@xmath0mo@xmath23o@xmath1 ( @xmath23 = tc , re ) to be robust hm - afms .",
    "our _ ab initio _ theoretical search was based on first - principles calculations within density - functional theory ( dft )  @xcite with the local density approximation ( lda ) plus the generalized gradient corrections ( gga )  @xcite .",
    "we used the highly accurate all - electron full - potential linearized augmented plane wave ( flapw ) method  @xcite as implemented in the wien2k package  @xcite , to calculate the total energy , electronic band structure and magnetic properties for the materials with fixed structural parameters .",
    "the flapw method makes no shape approximations to the electron density or potential and retains high variational freedom in all regions , and hence it is well suited to open crystal structures with low site - symmetries such as those considered here .",
    "the wave function , charge density , and potential were expanded in term of the spherical harmonics inside the muffin - tin spheres .",
    "the cut off angular momentum ( @xmath24 ) of 10 used for the wave function and of 6 used for the charge density and potential are sufficient for accurate total - energy calculations  @xcite .",
    "the wave function outside the muffin - tin spheres was expanded in terms of the augmented plane waves .",
    "a large number of augmented plane waves ( about 115 per atom ) ( i.e. , @xmath25 ) were included in the present calculations .",
    "the set of basis functions was supplemented with local orbitals for additional flexibility in representing the valence v 3@xmath5 states , ru 4@xmath5 states , os 5@xmath5 states and la 4@xmath26 states , as well as the semicore ca ( or sr , ba ) 3@xmath27 , 3@xmath28 , la 5@xmath27 , 5@xmath28 , o 2@xmath27 states .",
    "the muffin - tin sphere radii used are 2.5 a.u . for la and ca ( or sr , ba ) , and 2.0 a.u . for v , ru , os , mo , cr , tc and re , 1.4 a.u . for o.",
    "the improved tetrahedron method is used for the brillouin - zone integration  @xcite .",
    "we used 140 @xmath29-points in the irreducible brillouin zone wedge , which correspond to 1500 @xmath29-points in the first brillouin - zone .",
    "for the structural optimization calculations to determine theoretical lattice constants and atomic positions , we used the faster frozen - core full - potential projector augmented wave method ( paw )  @xcite as implemented in the vasp package  @xcite .",
    "a cutoff energy of 450 ev for plane waves is used .",
    "a 8@xmath308@xmath306 monkhorst - pack @xmath29-point grid in the brillouin zone was used , which correspond to 30 @xmath29-points in the irreducible brillouin - zone wedge .",
    "their atomic positions and lattice constants were fully relaxed by a conjugate gradient technique .",
    "theoretical equilibrium structures were obtained when the forces acting on all the atoms and the stresses were less than 0.05 ev / @xmath31 and 1.5 kbar , respectively .",
    "we consider la@xmath2o@xmath1 ( @xmath0 = ca , sr , ba ) in an ordered double perovskite structure [ space group p4/nmm ( no . 129 ) ] , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "this structure can be regarded as a combination of cubic la@xmath3o@xmath9 and @xmath32o@xmath9 perovskites in a superlattice having @xmath3 and @xmath4 layers stacked along the [ 111 ] direction , as in la@xmath11crfeo@xmath1 .",
    "transition metal ions @xmath3 and @xmath4 can couple to each other either ferromagnetically or antiferromagnetically in the [ 111 ] directions .",
    "each @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) ion has six @xmath4 ( @xmath3 ) neighbors . la@xmath3o@xmath9 and",
    "@xmath32o@xmath9 perovskites can also be stacked along the [ 001 ] direction , resulting in a double perovskite structure with the space group p4 mm ( no .",
    "99 ) , as has been considered by park , _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite . in this case , each @xmath3 ion has four @xmath3 ion and two @xmath4 ion neighbors , while each @xmath4 ion has four @xmath4 ion and two @xmath3 ion neighbors . we have performed electronic structure calculations for la@xmath0vruo@xmath1 and la@xmath0voso@xmath1 in both p4/nmm and p4 mm structures .",
    "we find , however , that la@xmath0vruo@xmath1 and la@xmath0voso@xmath1 in the [ 001 ] stacked structure are nonmagnetic and ferrimagnetic , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the calculated total energy for the [ 001 ] stacked structure is about 0.25@xmath330.35 ev / f.u .",
    "higher than that of the [ 111 ] stacked structure .",
    "this shows that the [ 111 ] stacked structure is more stable and thus we will not consider the [ 001 ] stacked structure further .",
    "the [ 111 ] stacked structure ( p4/nmm ) contains twenty atoms per unit cell , i.e. , two chemical formula units ( f.u . ) .",
    "it has a tetragonal symmetry with lattice constants @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the atomic positions of two la and two @xmath0 atoms are ( @xmath36 ) , ( @xmath37 ) and ( @xmath38 ) , ( @xmath39 ) , respectively",
    ". the atomic positions of two @xmath3 and two @xmath4 atoms are ( @xmath40 ) , ( @xmath41 ) and ( @xmath42 ) , ( @xmath43 ) , respectively .",
    "the o atoms are divided into three different types .",
    "the atomic positions of two type one and two type two o atoms are o@xmath44 : ( @xmath45 ) , ( @xmath46 ) and o@xmath11 : ( @xmath47 ) , ( @xmath48 ) , respectively , while the atomic positions of eight type three o atoms are o@xmath9 : ( @xmath49 ) , ( @xmath50 ) , ( @xmath51 ) , ( @xmath52 ) , ( @xmath53 ) , ( @xmath54 ) , ( @xmath55 ) , ( @xmath56 ) . therefore , in this structure , apart from lattice constants @xmath34 and @xmath35 , there are six more parameters to optimize , namely , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",

    "therefore , although we have settled down on the ordered double perovskite structure , there are still 3@xmath63 possible compounds to consider .",
    "this is an impossible task . nevertheless , our preliminary calculations and also the existing literature tell us that ti , cu , zr , nb , pd , ag , hf , ta , pt and au in the double perovskite structure are usually not magnetic and thus , they can be excluded from our further consideration",
    "furthermore , we note that in the double perovskite structure , mn and fe are almost always in a high spin state ( see , e.g. , refs . ) .",
    "consequantly , it is not possible to find a high spin state element from the remaining twelve elements to match mn and fe , and hence mn and fe are excluded from further consideration too .",
    "therefore , in our first stage of search for hm - afs , we consider all the possible @xmath6 pairs from only the twelve transition metal elements as denoted by bold italic characters in fig .",
    "2 . furthermore",
    ", we initially confine ourselves to @xmath64 ca .",
    "therefore , in our first stage of search , we have performed self - consistent electronic structure calculations only for sixty - six ( @xmath65 ) laca@xmath6o@xmath1 compounds in the ordered double perovskite structure with fixed lattice constants @xmath66  , @xmath67 taken from ref . .",
    "when we find any laca@xmath6o@xmath1 to be a hm - afm , we replace ca with sr and ba and perform further self - consistent electronic structure calculations .",
    "fortunately , we find from our electronic structure calculations for sixty - six laca@xmath6o@xmath1 compounds , that six @xmath3 and @xmath4 pairs , namely , vru , vos , motc , more , nitc , nire , would give rise to hm - af laca@xmath6o@xmath1 compounds .",
    "we note that previously , park , _ et al . _",

    "this perhaps explains why the attempt to synthesize the hm - afm la@xmath0vruo@xmath1 by liu , _ et al._,@xcite was unsuccessful .",
    "therefore , in our second stage of search , we carried out full lattice constant and atomic position relaxation calculations for all the possible hm - afm la@xmath2o@xmath1 compounds found in the first stage of search .",
    "we find fortunately that among the possible hm - afm la@xmath2o@xmath1 compounds , la@xmath0voso@xmath1 , la@xmath0motco@xmath1 and la@xmath0moreo@xmath1 stay as the stable hm - afms .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in our first round of search for the hm - afms , we also found la@xmath0crtco@xmath1 and la@xmath0crreo@xmath1 be antiferromagnets .",
    "however , la@xmath0crtco@xmath1 and la@xmath0crreo@xmath1 are insulators .",
    "nonetheless , we may regard these materials as unconventional afm insulators because they have several subtle differences in the electronic structure from archetypical afm insulators such as mno and nio in the cubic rocksalt structure .",
    "the calculated electronic and magnetic properties of these materials are listed in table viii .",
    "the total and orbital - decomposed dos spectra of lasrcrtco@xmath1 are displayed in fig .",
    "8 , as an example .",
    "these results are obtained from selfconsistent electronic structure calculations for the fully theoretically optimized crystal structures .",
    "compared with the hm - afms , these compounds have a stronger spin splitting of the @xmath69 @xmath7 band and a larger local magnetic moment on the @xmath3 and @xmath4 sites ( see fig . 8 and table viii ) .",
    "for instance , the spin splitting of the cr @xmath7 band in lasrcrtco@xmath1 is about 2.5 ev , significantly larger than that of the v @xmath7 band of less than 1.5 ev in lasrvoso@xmath1 .",
    "the local magnetic moment on the cr site in la@xmath0crtc(re)o@xmath1 is twice as large as that on the v site in la@xmath0voso@xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , the spin - down cr @xmath7 band in la@xmath0crtc(re)o@xmath1 is aligned with the spin - up tc(re ) @xmath7 band , rather than with the spin - down tc(re ) @xmath7 band as is the case in the hm - afm compounds discussed in the previous subsec .",
    "consequently , in la@xmath0tc(re)o@xmath1 , the generalized double exchange mechanism is ineffective and the antiferromagnetic coupling is due solely to the traditional superexchange mechanism .",
    "this gives rise to the afm insulating behavior in these compounds .",
    "total and orbital - decomposed density of states of lasrcrtco@xmath1 in the theoretical determined p4/nmm structure.,width=302 ]    in the conventional afm insulators , the two antiferromagnetic coupled ions are made of the same atomic species , e.g. , ni in nio .",
    "the two spin - decomposed total dos spectra are identical and the insulating gaps for spin up and spin down channels are the same .",
    "the novel features of the present afm insulators include that the two spin - decomposed total dos spectra are no longer the same and the spin up insulating gap may have a size different from that of the spin down insulating gap , as shown in table viii and fig .",
    "8 , and that the antiferromagnetic coupled ions consist of two different atomic species , e.g. , cr and tc in la@xmath0crtco@xmath1 .",
    "in conclusion , in order to search for the fascinating half - metallic antiferromagnetic materials , we have carried out a systematic _ ab initio _ study of the ordered double perovskites la@xmath2o@xmath1 with the possible @xmath3 and @xmath4 pairs from all the 3@xmath5 , 4@xmath5 and 5@xmath5 transtion metal elements being considered .",
    "electronic structure calculations based on first - principles density - functional theory with gga for more than sixty double perovskites laca@xmath6o@xmath1 have been performed using the all - electron flapw method . as a result",
    ", we find three families of the hm - afms , namely , la@xmath0voso@xmath1 , la@xmath0motco@xmath1 and la@xmath0moreo@xmath1 ( @xmath0 = ca , sr , ba ) .",
    "the found hm - afm state in these materials subsequently survives the full _ ab initio _ lattice constant and atomic position optimizations which were carried out using frozen - core full potential paw method .",
    "we attribute the afm to both the superexchange mechanism and the generalized double exchange mechanism via the @xmath3 ( @xmath7 ) - o ( 2@xmath8 ) - @xmath4 ( @xmath7 ) coupling and also believe the latter to be the origin of the hm .",
    "we also find that the hm - afm properties predicted previously in some of the double perovskites would disappear after the full structural optimizations , thereby providing an explanation why the previous experimental attempts to synthesize the hm - afm double perovskites did not succeed . finally , in our search for the hm - afms , we find la@xmath0crtco@xmath1 and la@xmath0crreo@xmath1 to be afm insulators of an unconventional type in the sense that the two antiferromagnetic coupled ions consist of two different elements and that the two spin - resolved densities of states are no longer the same .",
    "stimulated by previous theoretical predictions of the hm - afm in la@xmath11mnvo@xmath1@xcite and also in la@xmath0vruo@xmath1@xcite , experimental effort to synthesize the hm - afms has been reported by androulakis , _",
    "et al,_@xcite , and attempted by liu , _ et al,_@xcite , respectively , which were , however , unsuccessful .",
    "it is hoped that our predictions of robust hm - afms would encourage further experimental searches for the hm - afms .",
