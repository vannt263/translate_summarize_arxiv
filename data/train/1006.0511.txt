    "the rr  lyrae stars have been known for a long time to be an old population with diverse metallicity ( from near solar to [ fe / h]@xmath3 ) .",
    "they are present in most globular clusters but in widely different numbers ranging from zero to about 200 ( clement et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the general properties of rr  lyrae stars can be found in detail in the book by smith ( 1995 ) .",
    "most rr  lyrae stars in the field and in clusters are readily divided into two major categories : the rrc - type with periods from approximately 0.20 d to 0.45 d , and the rrab type with periods from about 0.4 to 1.0 days . there is a statistical correlation between metallicities and periods of rr  lyrae stars that the stars with longer periods are generally more metal - poor .",
    "very few rr  lyrae stars are known with periods longer than 0.75 days . in his classic paper on the metallicity of rr  lyrae stars preston ( 1959 ) included a few long period stars that he found to be relatively metal - rich .",
    "however he subsequently noted that the data of some of those stars , mostly their periods , were in error . among the recently discovered rr  lyrae stars in the northern sky variability survey ( nsvs ) , kinemuchi et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have found 21 variables with periods between 0.74 and 0.86 days whose metallicities range from [ fe / h]@xmath4 to @xmath5 dex , similar to the rr  lyrae stars with periods of 0.60 to 0.75 days .    the general picture of the long - period rr  lyrae stars having low metallicity has not been strongly challenged until the discovery of some long - period rr  lyrae stars in the two globulars , ngc  6388 and 6441 ( pritzl et al . 2000 ) .",
    "these two massive clusters have unusual color - magnitude diagrams .",
    "their red giant branches are relatively faint indicating that they are relatively metal - rich for globular clusters .",
    "a spectroscopic analysis of red giants in ngc 6388 showed that [ fe / h ] = @xmath6 ( wallerstein , kovtyukh , and andrievsky 2007 ) .",
    "for ngc 6441 , gratton et al .",
    "( 2007 ) found a metallicity of [ fe / h ] = @xmath7 .",
    "in addition , for ngc 6441 , clementini et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found a metallicity of @xmath6 from a sample of its rr lyrae stars .",
    "both horizontal branches consist of a well populated red clump accompanied by a significant number of blue stars including a blue tail in ngc 6441 . from preston s correlation of period and metallicity such high metallicties",
    "indicate that the rr lyrae stars should have short periods .",
    "however pritzl et al . found a wide range of periods in these clusters including numerous variables with periods larger than 0.75 days .    in an attempt to find field rr  lyrae stars that are similar to those with long periods in ngc  6388 and 6441 ,",
    "we have observed a few rr  lyraes with periods greater than 0.75 days . among them , kp  cyg appears to be the most unusual .",
    "first noted by vogt ( 1970 ) and subsequently confirmed by others ( loomis et al .",
    "1988 , schmidt 2002 ) , kp  cyg has a period of about 0.856 days , quite long for an rr  lyrae star .",
    "preston ( 1959 ) found its @xmath8 value to be around 0 , implying that kp  cyg is a metal - rich object .",
    "other than this information , we know little about the star . in this paper",
    "we present the results of an analysis of the chemical composition in this star s atmosphere .",
    "spectra of kp  cyg were obtained using the echelle spectrograph on the 3.5-m telescope , at the apache point observatory ( apo ) .",
    "the usable wavelength coverage , limited by the red - sensitive @xmath9 ccd chip , runs from 4000    to 9000  .",
    "the resolving power is about 35000 .",
    "the integration time of each exposure was set to 20@xmath1030 minutes to reach good s / n ratios , and to avoid heavy contamination from cosmic ray events .",
    "we then combined the spectra that were taken sequentially within one hour , and measured the s / n ratio at the continuum level per pixel in the very clean region between 7550 and 7600  of the combined spectra .",
    "table 1 lists the dates ( jd ) , phases , the heliocentric radial velocities ( @xmath11 ) , the derived values of t@xmath12 and @xmath13 for each phase , and signal - to - noise ratio of each spectrum .",
    "our @xmath11 measurements confirm that the period of kp cyg is around 0.9 days .",
    "we also note the presence of anomalous structures in h@xmath14 such as line doubling and emission .",
    "a comparison of the abundances derived from the spectra having anomalous h@xmath14 profiles with those derived from the spectra showing normal h@xmath14 profiles demonstrates that there is no very significant difference among the derived [ fe / h ] values .",
    "we suspect that the anomalous features in the h@xmath14 line profile originate from the layers far above the line forming region that is relevant to our abundance analysis ."
