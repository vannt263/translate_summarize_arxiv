    "` minor ' mergers of galaxies with total mass ratios greater than 3:1 @xmath6 4:1 are more common than ` major ' mergers with mass ratios closer to 1:1 . cosmological - scale simulations and semi - analytic models suggest that minor mergers play a significant role in triggering star - formation in the early universe ( e.g. somerville , primack , & faber 2001 ) , accreting mass onto galaxies ( e.g. guo & white 2008 ; genel et al .",
    "2009 ; stewart et al . 2009 ) , and growing the stellar haloes of massive galaxies ( e.g. johnston , hernquist , & bolte 1996 ; bell et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "however , there exist few observational constraints on the minor merger rate and its evolution with time .",
    "galaxy mergers may be identified either by searching for pre - merger systems of galaxies close in projected separation and relative velocity , or for galaxies with disturbed morphologies .",
    "minor merger studies with close pairs are hampered by the high contrast ratio between the primary and satellite galaxies .",
    "it is challenging to obtain spectroscopic velocities or reliable photometric redshifts for the satellite galaxies with masses and luminosities @xmath5 a tenth of the primary galaxies .",
    "additionally , the contamination rate from background galaxies increases dramatically as the luminosity difference between the primary and satellite galaxies increases .",
    "it has generally been assumed that the morphological effects of minor mergers are subtle .",
    "high resolution n - body simulations of gas - rich minor mergers find that such events may thicken but not destroy the discs of the primary galaxies ( moster et al .",
    "2009 ; purcell , kanzantzidis , & bullock 2009 ; robertson et al . 2006 ; abadi et al .",
    "2003 ) , as may minor mergers on retrograde or circular orbits ( e.g. velazquesz & white 1999 ; hopkins et al .",
    "similarly , minor mergers may deposit material onto the outer regions of high redshift compact spheroids , but do not significantly change their inner density structure ( naab et al . 2009 ; hopkins et al .",
    "a study of a 5:1 pure n - body galaxy merger simulation found that the merger never showed asymmetries strong enough to meet the standard merger criterion ( conselice 2006 ) .",
    "however , recent studies of the visual classification of galaxy mergers suggests that @xmath5 50% of visually disturbed galaxies may result from minor mergers ( jogee et al 2009 ; darg et al .",
    "minor mergers and interactions may also produce lopsided discs ( e.g. rudnick & rix 1998 ; bournaud et al .",
    "2005 ; reichard et al .",
    "therefore the morphological effects of minor mergers during the merger event may be more significant than previously thought .    with a better physical understanding of why and",
    "when merging galaxies appear morphologically disturbed , we can constrain the observed galaxy minor and major merger rate .",
    "most previous theoretical studies of minor mergers have focused on the structures of the merger remnants ( e.g. hopkins et al . 2009 ; naab et al .",
    "2009 ; robertson et al 2006 ; bournaud , jog , & combes et al .",

    "( 2005 ) performed a detailed study of the lopsidedness of disc galaxy mergers , and found that gas - rich minor mergers could appear strongly lopsided . in this work",
    ", we explore the strong morphological signatures predicted by simulations of disc mergers with a range of mass ratios and orbital parameters .",
    "translating the number of observed merger candidates into a merger rate requires the assumption of an observability time - scale  the time during which one would have identified the system as merging . until now ,",
    "the time - scales for detected disturbed morphologies have been poorly constrained .",
    "the observability time - scale for a particular merger may depend on ( 1 ) the method used to identify the merger ; ( 2 ) the merger parameters ( mass ratio , gas properties , bulge / disc ratio , orbits , dust content ) ; and ( 3 ) the observational selection ( observed wavelength , viewing angle , spatial resolution ) .",
    "cosmological - scale numerical simulations currently do not have the spatial resolution to directly determine the cosmologically - averaged observability time - scale for each method .",
    "therefore , one is required to use a suite of galaxy - scale numerical simulations which span a large range of input merger parameters to constrain the observability time - scales for the different input parameters . given a sufficiently broad range of merger parameters ,",
    "the observability time - scales for each parameter set may then be weighted by the probability distribution of the mass ratios , gas fraction , etc . which can be computed from current cosmological - scale simulations .",
    "an additional complication is that galaxy - scale numerical simulations typically track the distribution of ` particles ' ( star , gas , and dark matter ) , as opposed to the projected light distribution at a particular wavelength ( which is what is observed ) .",
    "we continue the work first presented in lotz et al . 2008b , hereafter paper 1 . in paper 1 ,",
    "we used gadget n - body / sph simulations processed through the radiative transfer code sunrise to obtain the rest - frame @xmath0 morphologies of equal - mass gas - rich disc mergers .",
    "we found that the time - scales for identifying a particular galaxy merger could be quite different depending on the gas - fraction of the merging galaxies and the method used to find the merger .",
    "for a given method , the time - scales associated with strong morphological disturbances are not a strong function of orbit , orientation , total mass , or supernovae feedback .",
    "the effects of numerical resolution , dust , viewing angle , and spatial resolution are also presented in paper 1 .    in this paper , we focus on the effect of mass ratio on the quantitative morphologies and projected separations of simulated mergers of disc galaxies with gas fractions , bulge - to - disc ratios , and masses tuned to match local galaxies . in  2 , we describe the simulations , the properties of the initial galaxies , and the range of merger parameters . in  3 , we briefly describe the analysis of the resulting simulated @xmath0-band images and the criteria for identification as a merger by morphology and projected separation . in  4 , we discuss the resulting observability time - scales and their dependence on the merger mass ratios , orbits , and relative orientation .",

    "<S> the majority of galaxy mergers are expected to be minor mergers . </S>",
    "<S> the observational signatures of minor mergers are not well understood , thus there exist few constraints on the minor merger rate . </S>",
    "<S> this paper seeks to address this gap in our understanding by determining if and when minor mergers exhibit disturbed morphologies and how they differ from the morphology of major mergers . </S>",
    "<S> we simulate a series of unequal - mass moderate gas - fraction disc galaxy mergers . with the resulting @xmath0-band images , </S>",
    "<S> we determine how the time - scale for identifying galaxy mergers via projected separation and quantitative morphology ( the gini coefficient @xmath1 , asymmetry @xmath2 , and the second - order moment of the brightest 20% of the light @xmath3 ) depends on the merger mass ratio , relative orientations and orbital parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath4 is as sensitive to 9:1 baryonic mass ratio mergers as 1:1 mergers , with observability time - scales @xmath5 0.2@xmath60.4 gyr . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , asymmetry finds mergers with baryonic mass ratios between 4:1 and 1:1 ( assuming local disc galaxy gas - fractions ) . </S>",
    "<S> asymmetry time - scales for moderate gas - fraction major disc mergers are @xmath5 0.2@xmath60.4 gyr , and less than 0.06 gyr for moderate gas - fraction minor mergers . </S>",
    "<S> the relative orientations and orbits have little effect on the time - scales for morphological disturbances . </S>",
    "<S> observational studies of close pairs often select major mergers by choosing paired galaxies with similar luminosities and/or stellar masses . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the various ways of finding galaxy mergers ( @xmath4 , @xmath2 , close pairs ) are sensitive to galaxy mergers of different mass ratios . by comparing the frequency of mergers selected by different techniques , </S>",
    "<S> one may place empirical constraints on the major and minor galaxy merger rates .    </S>",
