    "the notion of _ random rooted graph _ ( as described by d.  aldous and r.  lyons in  @xcite ) arises in substance from the paper @xcite of r.  lyons , r.  pemantle , and y.  peres on galton - watson trees .",
    "bernoulli bond percolation on a cayley graph @xmath0 provides the basic example of random rooted graph , which is obtained by keeping each edge with constant probability @xmath1 independently to other edges , see figure  [ fig : cluster ] .",
    "this kind of random graphs ( and other obtained by bond percolation on cayley graphs or unimodular transitive graphs ) enjoy the important property of _ insertion - tolerance _ introduced by r. lyons and o. schramm in definition 3.2 of @xcite : the measure of a nonnull borel set after adding an edge is nonnull .",
    "however , this property does not hold for other examples of random graphs arising as orbit closures of repetitive subgraphs of @xmath0 in the gromov - hausdorff space ( described in @xcite ; see also @xcite and @xcite ) , see figure  [ fig : kenyontree ] .",

    ". then the orbit closure of any proper repetitive subgraph @xmath69 of @xmath0 is @xmath104-null .",

    "however , the cluster indistinguishability theorem also holds for some @xmath47-invariant percolation processes with @xmath110 , like the _ percolation process with scenery _ introduced in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark 3.4 ) ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 6 ) ) .",
