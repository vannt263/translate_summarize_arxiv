    "the interaction of quantum systems with its immediate environment leads to decoherence or a decay of quantum phase coherences that destroys the delicate interference effects among its quantum states . as a consequence , macroscopic quantum superpositions",
    "are strongly suppressed and classical behavior emerges from the quantum regime @xcite .",
    "the physics at this borderline between the classical and quantum regime is not well understood yet and continues to attract research attention @xcite .",
    "the quantum systems coupled to the environment lose their coherence exponentially fast @xcite and this is modelled by the decoherence factor of the form @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the coherence time that generally depends on the system parameters including the strength of coupling to the environment . in many applications ,",
    "it is necessary to sustain the quantum coherences for as long as possible and this might be possible by tuning @xmath1 .",
    "one exciting area of application is to perform experimental quantum computation which requires quantum registers to maintain coherences and entanglements .    in the last two decades , it has become possible to engineer suitable quantum reservoirs ( environments ) in experiments with desired control over the coupling to the system of interest @xcite .",
    "this has allowed direct observation of decoherence dynamics in a mesoscopic system of harmonically trapped single atom coupled to a reservoir of random electric fields @xcite as also in an atom - optics based kicked rotor system @xcite . within the framework of exponential decoherence factors , these experiments tune the coherence time @xmath1 by controlling a system parameter or the coupling to the environment .",
    "even so , exponential decay of coherences leads to classical regime too quickly .",
    "however , recently it was shown that in principle it should be possible to introduce power law type decoherence factors to achieve relatively slow and controlled decoherence @xcite .",
    "an unusual feature of the non - exponential decoherence factor is that it encompasses a regime in which the system might not complete its transition to the classical regime .",
    "exploring the consequences of non - exponential decoherence might also lead to greater degree of control over decoherence .",

    "classically it is a chaotic system and displays diffusive growth of mean energy whereas its quantized version suppresses the energy growth .",
    "this is termed dynamical localization ( dl ) in analogy with the anderson localization in condensed matter physics @xcite .",

    "in contrast with these earlier studies , in this work , we induce decoherence in aokr by introducing a noisy scenario in which kicks do not act at certain time instants and the waiting time in between successive kicks taken from lvy distribution @xmath2 . as we show below , both through theory and experiments , this scenario leads to non - exponential decoherence rates and quantum sub - diffusive energy growth .",

    "an atom - optics kicked rotor which is periodically kicked displays dynamical localization in the momentum basis and entirely suppresses the energy growth . in general ,",

    "[ fig2 ] shows that in the presence of uniformly distributed timing noise , the quantum mean energy growth coincides with that of the corresponding classical system .",
    "however , if the waiting times between kicks are lvy distributed , then the resulting random kick sequence does not lead to exponentially fast decoherence .",
    "hence the quantum mean energy growth is partially inhibited . as pointed out earlier , the aokr system can clearly distinguish between lvy distribution and uniform distribution of waiting times in few tens of kicks , which makes this experiment feasible .    in the regime where @xmath99 , the mean waiting time diverges and the decoherence factor is in general non - exponential . in this case , the quantum evolution of an arbitrary initial wavepacket is sub - diffusive and carries the signature of the lvy exponent .",
