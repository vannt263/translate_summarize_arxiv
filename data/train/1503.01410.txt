    "soft - gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) are strongly - magnetized neutron stars with magnetic fields of @xmath5 g that produce frequent , short - duration bursts ( @xmath6 s ) of @xmath7 ergs in hard x - ray and soft gamma - rays .",
    "sgrs occasionally produce giant flares that last @xmath8 s ; the first giant flare to be detected occurred in sgr 0526 - 66 on 5 march , 1979 @xcite , releasing @xmath9 erg @xcite .",
    "the august 27th 1998 giant flare from sgr 1900 + 14 liberated @xmath10 erg , with a rise time of @xmath11 ms @xcite .",
    "the duration of the initial peak was @xmath12 s @xcite . on december 27 , 2004 ,",
    "sgr 1806 - 20 produced the largest flare yet recorded , with a total energy yield of @xmath13 ergs . in both short bursts and in giant flares , the peak luminosity is reached in under 10 ms . measured spin down parameters imply surface dipole fields of @xmath14 g for sgr 0526 - 66 @xcite , @xmath15 g for sgr 1900 + 14 @xcite , and @xmath16 g for sgr 1806 - 20 @xcite , establishing these objects as magnetars .",
    "the giant flares in sgr 1806 - 20 ( hereafter sgr 1806 ) and sgr 1900 + 14 ( hereafter sgr 1900 ) showed rotationally phase - dependent , quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) .",
    "qpos in sgr 1806 were detected at 18 hz , 26 hz , 30 hz , 93 hz , 150 hz , 626 hz , and 1837 hz @xcite .",
    "qpos in the giant flare of sgr 1900 were detected at 28 hz , 53 hz , 84 hz , and 155 hz @xcite .",
    "recently , oscillations at 57 hz were identified in the short bursts of sgr 1806 @xcite , and at 93 hz , 127 hz , and possibly 260 hz in sgr j1550 - 5418 @xcite .",
    "overall , the data show that sgrs 1806 and 1900 support oscillations with spectra that begin at about 20 hz , with a spacing of some tens of hz below 160 hz .",
    "the relative dearth of high - frequency qpos could indicate a sparse spectrum above 160 hz , or highly - preferential mode excitation .",
    "given that we do not understand how surface oscillations affect magnetospheric emission , it could be that some modes are not seen because they do not create large changes in the x - ray emissivity for our viewing angle .",
    "@xcite predicted that the most energetic magnetar flares would excite observable seismic modes of the neutron star crust .",
    "the easiest modes to excite , duncan argued , would be torsional oscillations which , for the assumed composition , begin at about 30 hz .",
    "the fundamental torsional mode consists of periodic twisting of two hemispheres in opposite directions .",
    "crust rigidity provides the restoring force , and the star oscillates as a torsion pendulum .    initial theoretical study of the observed qpos treated the crust and core as uncoupled for simplicity @xcite . as pointed out by @xcite , however , the strong magnetic field of a magnetar introduces an essential complication ; the charged component of the fluid core , primarily protons and electrons , supports alfvn waves that couple to the highly - conductive crust and affect the mode spectrum .",
    "a neutron star therefore can not be regarded as possessing crust modes that are separate from the core , rather , we must consider _ global _ oscillations of the crust - core system @xcite .",
    "it has become clear that the nature of the alfvn wave spectrum of the core plays a crucial role in the global magneto - elastic problem . for smooth magnetic field geometries , such as uniform magnetization or a dipole field , the core fluid",
    "can be regarded as supporting an _ alfvn continuum _ of frequencies ; each frequency corresponds to a natural frequency of a magnetic field line .",
    "since there is a continuous distribution of line lengths through some range , the spectrum is continuous .",
    "dipolar field geometries and their extensions generally give a core spectrum with continuous _ bands _ separated by _",
    "gaps _ , and a low - frequency cut - off or _ edge _",
    ", much like electronic band structure in solids .",
    "the crust , by contrast , supports only a discrete spectrum of torsional modes if isolated from the core .",
    "when the crust is included and coupled to the core fluid through magnetic stresses , the structure of the core spectrum leads to very rich dynamics as shown by @xcite for a simple model with a thin crust and a core of constant magnetization .",
    "if energy is deposited in the crust at one of the natural frequencies of the crust , and this frequency lies within a portion of the core continuum , the energy is lost to the core continuum in less than 0.1 s as the entire core continuum is excited .",
    "the crust excitation is effectively damped through _ resonant absorption _",
    ", a familiar process in mhd ; see , @xcite .",
    "the turning points and edges in the alfvn continuum play a special role in the dynamics ; power rests at these points and gives qpos .",
    "subsequent work on purely fluid stars in general - relativistic mhd with more realistic field geometries also showed oscillations near the continuum edges @xcite . @xcite",
    "have shown that if a natural frequency of the free crust happens to fall within a gap , there is little loss of the crust s oscillation energy to the core by resonant absorption ; see also work by @xcite .",
    "frequency drift , due to the effects of the continuum , generally occurs @xcite .",
    "this basic picture has been further developed and refined @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite find that all observed qpos in sgrs 1806 and 1900 can be accommodated with a particular arrangement of continuum gaps .",
    "@xcite find in a spherical model with a magnetic field with both poloidal and toroidal components that peaks below about 100 hz can persist in the power spectrum , though these peaks are far broader than observed .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite find a small number of low - frequency qpos that exist in the continuum gaps and at turning points for their assumed field geometries that agree qualitatively with observations .",
    "superfluidity widen the gaps in the alfvn continuum @xcite .",
    "most of the work on the global oscillation problem described above relies on tuning the locations of the gaps and turning points in the alfvn continuum to accommodate the observed qpos .",
    "here we take a rather different view than in previous work , and assert that the alfvn continuum that has been so problematic is unlikely to exist at all . the alfvn continuum results from assuming",
    "_ smooth _ , poloidal field configurations",
    ". given the convective dynamo that is expected to operate in a proto - magnetar , and subsequent evolution of the initial field , we expect the field to have high - order evolving multipoles .",
    "we conjecture that the field is complex and tangled over length scales small compared to the stellar radius , and smooth only on average .",
    "high - order multipoles ( the tangle ) , could be long lived in the core where the electrical conductivity is high . @xcite",
    "have argued that a highly - tangled field is likely to reduce or eliminate the importance of the alfvn continuum and to give an effective shear modulus to the core fluid ; they demonstrated that the continuum is broken for a `` box '' neutron star .",
    "much work on the qpo problem has included realistic neutron structure , specific magnetic field geometries , and the effects of general relativity .",
    "given that the interior field geometry will likely remain unknown , we take a step back in sophistication and propose a minimal , illustrative model of the low - frequency magnetar qpos ( @xmath17 hz ) .",
    "the star is essentially a self - gravitating , constant - density , magnetized fluid whose oscillation frequencies are determined by the anisotropic magnetic stresses from the large - scale organized field ( primarily the dipole component ) and the approximately isotropic magnetic stresses introduced by the tangled field ; we show that density stratification and the crust typically change the oscillation frequencies by only @xmath1% ( though 30 - 50% for some fundamental modes ) , so this simple model is an adequate first approximation for developing a quantitative understanding of torsional modes , while elucidating the essential physics .",
    "general relativity is included only as a redshift factor that reduces the oscillation frequencies observed at infinity by about 20% .",
    "we show that if the energy density in the tangled field is comparable to that in the large - scale field , a discrete normal mode spectrum beginning at around 20 hz with a spacing of 10 hz appears naturally for axial modes , generally consistent with observations of qpos below 160 hz , and that all qpos observed in sgrs 1806 and 1900 in this frequency range can be accounted for to within 3 hz .",
    "we do not address the character of high - frequency modes due to limitations to our model that we describe . to illustrate the key features of the model ,",
    "the normal - mode analysis will be restricted entirely to axial modes .",

    "the energy can not be released deep inside the star , as the impedance mismatch between the stellar interior and the magnetosphere is so great that the energy in alfvn waves would take seconds or longer to reach the magnetosphere due to multiple reflections , in conflict with observed rise times of @xmath100 ms @xcite .",

    "the sum of the total energy in all modes can be approximated with an integral @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the lowest - frequency normal mode in the spectrum .",
    "we see that the conversion of magnetospheric energy to mechanical motion in the star an inefficient process ; about 0.1% of the flare energy goes into normal modes .",
    "the total energy in the modes in our model is well within the energy budget of a giant flare .    for a small flare , with @xmath116 erg , the amplitude from eq .",
    "[ u ] is smaller by @xmath117 than if @xmath118 is liberated .",
    "these estimates hold not just for our model , but generally for any global - oscillation model of qpos .",
    "we propose a new physical scenario for magnetar oscillations wherein the alfvn continuum supported by the organized field is broken by nearly isotropic stresses arising from components of the field that form a complex tangle over scales much smaller than the stellar radius . in a simple model of constant density ,",
    "an organized field of strength @xmath0 g , and a tangled field of comparable strength , a fundamental frequency appears near 20 hz for @xmath119 and @xmath120 , with a with a mode spacing of @xmath1 hz ( we use @xmath88 from the solutions of the isotropic problem to label the modes of the anisotropic problem ) .",
    "the model is consistent with qpos observed in sgrs 1806 and 1900 below about 160 hz .",
    "magnetic stresses dominate material stresses almost everywhere in the crust , so crust elasticity is unimportant when a strong , tangled field is present . we find that the combined effects of realistic stellar structure and crust stress give a modest change in the eigenfrequencies of @xmath1% for most modes ( but up to 50% for low-@xmath88 fundamentals ) so our simple model with constant density is a good first approximation to studying tangled fields that elucidates the essential physics . the strength of the organized field , which should be approximately dipolar , is determined observationally .",
    "once stellar mass and radius are fixed , the model has only one important free parameter : the ratio of the energy densities in tangled and organized fields .",
    "our results are insensitive to whether or not the protons are superconducting .",
    "the upper critical field for type ii superconductivity is @xmath121 g , comparable to average fields we find to be consistent with the qpos observed in sgrs 1806 and 1900 ; the magnetic stress is nearly the same if the protons are superconducting , though we have assumed for definiteness that they are normal .",
    "also , if the protons are superconducting , the neutrons are only slightly entrained by the protons throughout most of the core , and the dynamical mass density is nearly equal to the proton mass density in this case as well .    while our constant - density model is mostly illustrative ,",
    "it is nevertheless sufficiently accurate to study torsional oscillations semi - quantitatively within our approximations ; the model is able to account for _ every _ qpo observed in sgrs 1806 and 1900 to within 3 hz .",
    "no other published model has given such quantitative agreement , though we acknowledge that the success of the model is due in large part to the rather dense spectrum we predict with a frequency spacing of about 10 hz .",
    "we find the data are best explained if there is approximate equipartition of the energy in the smooth and tangled fields .",
    "such modes have high enough wavenumbers to probe the field structure over scales below @xmath122 , at which point the averaging procedure we introduced to treat the tangled field might become inappropriate .    why have most of the predicted frequencies not been observed ?",
    "one possibility is that the modes have been excited , but are not visible . given that we do not understand how surface oscillations affect magnetospheric emission , it could be that some modes are not seen because they do not produce sufficiently large changes in the x - ray emissivity to be visible from our viewing angle .",
    "another possibility is that the instability that drives the flare creates highly - preferential excitation of axial modes .",
    "we note that preferential excitation of low - frequency free oscillations occurs in the earth @xcite , the so - called `` hum '' .",
    "the question of how preferential excitation of stellar modes might occur is an interesting question .",
    "while our focus has been on sgrs 1806 and 1900 , which have dipole fields of @xmath0 g , qpos have been reported for sgr j1550 - 5418 @xcite in association with burst storms .",
    "sgr j1550 - 5418 has an inferred dipole field of @xmath123 g @xcite . in this object , as in sgr 1900 , the observed qpos can be accounted for if most of the magnetic energy is in the tangled field , so that the average magnetic field is @xmath0 g.    a crucial ingredient in the interpretation of qpos as stellar oscillations is to understand how crust movement can produce the large observed modulations of the x - ray emission by 10 - 20% .",
    "@xcite propose that twisting of the crust , associated with a stellar mode , modulates the charge density in the magnetosphere , creating variations in the optical depth for resonant compton scattering of the hard x - rays that accompany the flare . in that model",
    ", the shear amplitude at the stellar surface must be as large as 1% of the stellar radius .",
    "@xcite accounted for geometrical effects of the beamed emission , and find that the amplitude of the qpo emission is increased by a factor of typically several over the estimate of @xcite for a given amplitude of the surface displacement .",
    "based on the analysis of @xcite of mode excitation by a sudden change in magnetospheric equilibrium , we find that the predicted , low - frequency qpo spectrum could contain up to @xmath124 erg in mechanical energy .",
    "this number is well within the energy budget of giant flares but the surface amplitude is only @xmath125 , smaller than required by @xcite , especially for the qpos near 160 hz .",
    "this small amplitude could spell trouble for the global - oscillation interpretation of qpos , unless a more efficient mechanism than that of @xcite can be identified .",
    "explaining qpos in small bursts ( @xmath126 erg ) appears particularly difficult with a global oscillation model .",
    "the mode amplitude scales as the flare energy ( eq . [ u ] ) , giving a surface amplitude that is @xmath127 times smaller than for a giant flare .",
    "the 626 hz qpo reported in sgr 1806 also seems problematic to excite in a giant flare , with a surface amplitude of @xmath128 in the most optimistic case .",
    "these numbers show that energetics should be given serious consideration in qpo models , and that other excitation mechanisms than that of @xcite should be considered .",
    "the simple model presented in this paper can be improved by including a crust and introducing realistic stellar structure .",
    "we have shown that the effects typically @xmath1 for most modes for a star in which the magnetic energy density is dominated by that in the tangled field ; the effects of stellar structure and the crust will become more important as the effective shear modulus from the tangled field is reduced , and we have not quantified these effects .",
    "other modes than axial modes , such as polar modes , should be considered as well .",
    "an explanation for why the observed frequencies are quasi - periodic is well beyond the scope of our model .",
