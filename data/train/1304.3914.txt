    "entanglement is the specific feature of quantum systems which reveals that complete information about parts of a composite system does not include complete information of the whole system @xcite .",
    "however , this is not the only weird character of a quantum system .",
    "for instance , the collapse of one part of a non - entangled bipartite quantum system after a measurement on the other part is another feature unique to quantum systems .",
    "the quantity that captures this feature is the quantum discord @xcite .",
    "the key idea of the concept of quantum discord is the superposition principle and the vanishing of discord shown to be a criterion for quantum to classical transition @xcite .",
    "furthermore , quantum discord has a simple interpretation in thermodynamics and has been used in analyzing the power of a quantum maxwell s demon @xcite .",
    "it has also been employed in the study of pure quantum states as a resource and performance of deterministic quantum computation with one pure qubit @xcite .",
    "the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite showed that non - classical correlations other than entanglement can be responsible for the quantum computational efficiency of deterministic quantum computation with one pure qubit @xcite and brought this obscured correlation measure to the spot light zone .",
    "after this discovery , quantum discord becomes one of the most frequent topics of researches in the field of quantum information theory .",
    "indeed , quantum discord is the difference between two classically equivalent definitions of mutual information in the quantum mechanics language . in mathematical sense",
    ", discord could be obtained by eliminating the whole of classical correlation from the total correlation measured by mutual information , by means of the most destructive measurement on the one party of the system .",
    "mutual information of a bipartite system can be written as @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 refer to the reduced density matrices of the subsystems @xmath5 and @xmath1 , respectively , @xmath6 is the density matrix of the system as the whole , and @xmath7 is the von neumann entropy . the classical correlation between the parts of a bipartite system can be obtained by use of the measurement - base conditional density operator and can be written as @xcite @xmath8 here the maximum is taken over all projective measurement @xmath9 on the subsystem @xmath1 @xcite , and @xmath10 is the conditional entropy of the subsystem @xmath5 , with @xmath11 as the post - measurement state of the subsystem @xmath5 and @xmath12 being the probability of the @xmath13-th outcome .",

    "we only consider @xmath16 and hence ignore the subscript @xmath1 in the following .    the optimization procedure involved in the calculation of quantum discord",
    "prevents one to write an analytical expression for quantum discord even for simple two - qubit systems .",
    "quantum discord is analytically computed only for a few families of states including the bell - diagonal states @xcite , two - qubit @xmath17 states @xcite , two - qubit rank-2 states @xcite , a class of rank-2 states of @xmath18 systems @xcite , and gaussian states of the continuous variable systems @xcite . moreover ,",
    "based on the optimization of the conditional entropy , an algorithm to calculate the quantum discord of the two - qubit states is presented in @xcite .",
    "it is also important to have some computable bounds on the quantum discord and some authors have obtained such bounds @xcite .    in this paper , we consider two - qubit states and obtain a simple relation for the quantum conditional entropy @xmath0 as the difference of two shannon entropies .",
    "this form of the conditional entropy enables one to calculate its minimum for some classes of two - qubit states , without any minimization procedure .",
    "an analytical progress in the minimization of the conditional entropy of a general two - qubit state is also presented .",
    "moreover , we obtain a tight upper bound on the quantum discord of an arbitrary two - qubit state and show that such obtained upper bound satisfy the stationary conditions of the conditional entropy , when we restrict the measurement direction to a special subspace of @xmath19 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we consider a general two - qubit system and present a simple relation for the quantum conditional entropy . in this section",
    ", we also evaluate the quantum discord for some classes of states , and present a tight upper bound on the discord of a general two - qubit state .",
    "section iii is devoted to the optimization procedure .",
    "an analytical conditions under which the conditional entropy is stationary is presented in this section .",
    "the paper is concluded in section iv with a brief discussion .",
    "a general two - qubit state can be written in the hilbert - schmidt representation as @xmath20 here @xmath21 stands for the identity operator , @xmath22 are the standard pauli matrices , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are coherence vectors of the subsystems @xmath5 and @xmath1 , respectively , and @xmath25 is the correlation matrix .",
    "therefore , to each state @xmath6 we associate the triple @xmath26 .",
    "since quantum correlations are invariant under local unitary transformation , i.e. under transformations of the form @xmath27 with @xmath28 , we can , without loss of generality , restrict our considerations to some representative class of the states described by less number of parameters @xcite . under such transformations ,",
    "the triple @xmath26 transforms as @xmath29 where @xmath30 s corresponds to @xmath31 s via @xmath32 @xcite . in view of this",
    ", any state of the two - qubit system can be written as @xmath27 , where @xmath6 belongs to the representative class . in the following",
    "we will consider a representative class such that @xmath33 is diagonal , namely @xmath34 .",
    "concerning this representative class , a general state of two - qubit system can be parameterized by nine real parameters @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath34 , where @xmath37 denotes transposition . accordingly , in the computational basis @xmath38 , a general state @xmath6 of this representative class takes the following form @xmath39 where @xmath40 now let us turn our attention on the von neumann measurement on the subsystem b. a general such measurement can be written as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the von neumann projection operators in the standard basis of the subsystem @xmath1 , and @xmath43 .",
    "an arbitrary element of @xmath44 can be factorized as @xcite @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 defined by @xmath48 for @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",

    "this implies that if we find @xmath93 as the optimal measurement for a given state @xmath6 of the representative class , one can obtain the optimal one for any state @xmath94 , just by the transformation @xmath95 .",

    "before we give a general procedure for optimization , we give below some special classes of states for which the quantum discord can be evaluated without the need for any optimization .",

    "<S> calculation of the quantum discord requires to find the minimum of the quantum conditional entropy @xmath0 over all measurements on the subsystem @xmath1 . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we provide a simple relation for the conditional entropy as the difference of two shannon entropies . </S>",
    "<S> the relation is suitable for calculation of the quantum discord in the sense that it can by used to obtain the quantum discord for some classes of two - qubit states , without the need for minimization . </S>",
    "<S> we also present an analytical procedure of optimization and obtain conditions under which the quantum conditional entropy of a general two - qubit state is stationary . </S>",
    "<S> the presented relation is also used to find a tight upper bound on the quantum discord . </S>"
