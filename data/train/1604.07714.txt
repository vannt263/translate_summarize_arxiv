    "the hamiltonian of the system can be written as : @xmath17 where @xmath18 are the hamiltonians of the left ( l)/right ( r ) reservoirs respectively , @xmath19 describes the two central chains ( i and ii ) , @xmath20 represents the interaction between them and @xmath21 represents the contact between the two central chains and the reservoirs .",

    "the index @xmath37 labels the atom of a segement that is in contact with a reservoir    the reservoir hamiltonians corresponding to the semi - infinity chains are @xmath38 with @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) number of particles .",

    "the energy current that flows to and out a given elementary volume should cancel each other when the system reaches the steady state and in the case there is not local power injection , since there are not temporal variations of the mean local density of energy . as our hamiltonians involve only nearest - neighbors terms , the minimum volume that we consider is one that encloses nearest - neighbors sites . from the continuity equation and energy conservation , the local time - dependent heat current for the incoming energy current from connecting site @xmath52 of the central chain towards each reservoir @xmath53 gives :    @xmath54    with @xmath55 .",

    "the dc heat current corresponds to the quasi - steady state current established after a transient that is established earlier as long the on - site pinning potential is stronger @xcite .    on the other hand the heat transmission",
    "is mainly mediated by low frequency modes , the main responsible for heat conduction .",
    "the on - site potential produce a shift in the minimum cutoff frequency of the phonon bands from zero to @xmath111 , so the transmission function takes appreciable values if @xmath112 @xcite . when the strength of the pinning potential is increased , the device has a behavior closer to a thermal insulator . for higher values of the potential ,",
    "large current oscillations can be suppressed , even for high temperatures . in fig.[fig : tlandauer ] it is exemplified how the transmission function depends on the pinning potential . the transmission for @xmath113 is independent of the value of the local coupling between segments , as it is expected for non localized modes .",
    "the system becomes a good thermal conductor .",
    "the effect of @xmath114 is to increase the contribution of the localized modes to the transmission along the interface .",
    "that is the contact acts as a scatter point for high frequency phonons but not for low frequency ones .",
    "these soft phonon modes ( including zero - mode ) play a fundamental role in the heat conduction .    in a similar way we can define from eq.([fullj ] ) the @xmath115 component of the transmission function for the perturbed system    @xmath116    in fig.[fig : shift ]",

    "the transmission function shows that the system presents a multiresonant energy transport @xcite . therefore with a suitable modulation ,",
    "the allowed phonon band can be changed or shifted and so the phonons involved in the transport .",
    "consequently heat transfer along the device can be enhanced or restrict controlling and tuning _ dynamically _ the phononic thermal channels . and in turn the contact acts as a scatter point or interface where phonons can gain or lose a phonon of frequency @xmath118 .    from now on and without loss of generality , we take @xmath16 the reference temperature , being @xmath15 the variable one .",

    "[ power ] .",
    "although the currents have different absolute values , the power injected is low enough so the direction of the heat current is determined by @xmath129 .",
    "the system works as a heat conductor .",
    "regime @xmath5 : @xmath134 , @xmath138 this is a regime mainly governed by the injected power that is dissipated into both reservoirs .",
    "the onset of this regime is given by a current reversal in one of the segments .",
    "when @xmath126 or @xmath127 are equal to zero the device can operate as a local insulator , thus heat is inhibited to flow in one part of the system .",

    "heat flows from the cold reservoir to the hot one .",
    "regime @xmath142 : @xmath143 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 heat flows from hot to cold but in the reverse direction than regime @xmath4 .",
    "transport is again mainly ruled by the temperature gradient .",
    "depending on the driving frequency the system may display all or some of these regimes .",
    "thus , adjusting temperature gradients and ac - frequencies it is possible to tune changeovers between them .",
    "the transmission function of the system is strongly dependent on the structural parameters such as @xmath114 , who plays an important role on the potential regimes and transitions between them . in fig.[fig : conturs ] we show the contour phase diagram versus @xmath130 and @xmath114 for @xmath144 and @xmath145 . in both cases the weak coupling condition is fulfilled and @xmath146 takes non zero values .",

    "for @xmath144 the refrigeration regime extends over a considerable region of the parameter space .",
    "however for @xmath147 this regime is absent .",
    "as it was mentioned above , one possible reason is related to the differences between the transmission functions . in fig.[fig : shift ] we compare @xmath148 for both cases finding that high frequency channels associated to localized modes are not available for @xmath144 .    .",

    "the microscopic realization of a phonon refrigeration mechanism we are proposing is based on a _ dynamical _ cycle given by the periodic modulation of @xmath114 that produce the activation ( or deactivation ) of phonon modes or thermal channels .    since the structure of the leads is asymmetric they produce different phonon speed in each segment . additionally as they are finite ,",
    "the system has only limited time before the reflected or transmitted phonons from the reservoirs begin to arrive and interfere with other phonons moving through the contact or propagate along it . therefore for certain driving frequencies and @xmath129 intervals , the system can block the usual heat flowing in the direction of the temperature gradient , enabling the pumping of phonons against it .    unlike other works based on a time - dependent on - site potential @xcite , our mechanism is based on an periodical contact interaction . therefore our model can describe composite systems on substrates that can be realized by linear lattices with static pinning potentials .",
    "examples of such systems are polymeric polar chains where the opening or locking of phonon channels can be adjusted under the action of electric fields and composed short alkane chains o molecular junctions that can be stretched or pulled under some defined protocol@xcite .",
    "as the underlying mechanism is the shift and changes in the width of the phonon bands , the system size @xmath151 is one of the structural parameters that plays a relevant role affecting the number of available phonon modes , and therefore the cooling ability of the device .",
    "we calculate the ratio of cooling to energy consumption or cooling coefficient of performance @xmath154 as :    @xmath155    where @xmath156 is the heat extracted from the cold reservoir and @xmath157 is the heat injected on the hot one .",

    "however , the efficiency presents an upper and lower bound for the heat that can be extracted . the maximun and minimun heat extracted for an @xmath118 correspond to a @xmath159 going from zero to the maximun value respectively obtained from the phase diagram .",
    "in addition , the @xmath154 presents a monotonic behaviour , decreasing faster as long the heat is lower .     and @xmath145 with @xmath160 . ]",
    "the multiresonant feature of the transport is also reflected in the cooling performance of the system as it is shown in fig.[fig : cop ] where @xmath154 is plotted versus the size of the system .",
