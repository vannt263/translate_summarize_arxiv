    "the electric field of the ase light at the position of the trapped ion can be represented by the sum of two components with orthogonal polarizations ( @xmath15 ) : @xmath16 e^{-i\\omega_\\mathrm{ase } t } + \\text{c.c.},\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the center frequency of the field and @xmath18 stands for complex conjugate .",
    "if the light is unpolarized , the components @xmath19 and @xmath20 are completely uncorrelated stochastic variables and their intensities are equal @xcite .",
    "we use ornstein - uhlenbeck ( ou ) processes @xcite to model the stochastic variables , which is convenient as there are exact updating formulas for both the ou process and its time integral @xcite .",
    "the ou process @xmath21 obeys the langevin equation @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are positive constants , traditionally referred to as the relaxation time and diffusion constant , respectively , and @xmath25 is delta - correlated gaussian white noise fulfilling @xmath26 .",
    "the correlation function for @xmath21 is given by @xmath27    two common types of stochastic fields are the phase - diffusion ( pd ) field and the chaotic field @xcite .",
    "the phase - diffusion field , @xmath28 has a constant amplitude and a fluctuating phase and is typically used to describe a single - mode laser of finite bandwidth @xcite . in this model , the time derivatives of the phases , i.e. , the frequency fluctuations , fulfill the correlation function ( [ eq : oucorr ] ) , @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the delta function indicates that the two polarization components are uncorrelated .",
    "the ( normalized ) first - order correlation function of the phase - diffusion field is @xcite @xmath32}\\rangle \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\exp \\left\\{-\\frac{b}{2 } \\left[|\\tau|-\\frac{1}{\\beta}\\left(1-e^{-\\beta|\\tau|}\\right)\\right]\\right\\ } \\delta_{ij}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this corresponds to a lineshape that is essentially lorentzian within @xmath33 from line center and falls off as a gaussian outside this region . in the limit @xmath34 ,",

    "this gives the first - order correlation function @xmath42 , identical to that of the pd model in the @xmath34 limit .",
    "thus also the spectrum of the chaotic field is a lorentzian with a fwhm of @xmath36 . for a real gaussian process",
    ", the first - order correlation function contains all the information about the higher - order correlation functions [ see , e.g. , eq .  ( 2.18 ) in ref .",

    "the second - order correlation properties of the polarized ase from a superluminescent light - emitting diode ( sled ) have recently been studied @xcite .",
    "it was shown that @xmath44 depends on the pump current of the sled : at low currents the sled emits pure chaotic light , @xmath45 , but as the current increases , the value of @xmath46 decreases , being @xmath47 at the highest current .",
    "we expect other ase sources to show a similar dependence on the pump and have therefore constructed a field model with adjustable intensity correlations . expressing the chaotic field as @xmath48 ^ 2 + [ \\mathcal{e}_j^\\mathrm{i}(t)]^2\\}^{1/2 } e^{i \\arg{[\\mathcal{e}_j^\\mathrm{r}(t ) + i \\mathcal{e}_j^\\mathrm{i}(t ) ] } } \\equiv |\\mathcal{e}_{\\text{ch},j}(t)| e^{i\\arg{\\mathcal{e}_{\\text{ch},j}(t)}}$ ] , we write the ase field as @xmath49^{1/2 } e^{i\\arg{\\mathcal{e}_{\\text{ch},j}(t)}}.\\ ] ] we have numerically verified that the first - order correlation function of also this field is @xmath50 . the second - order correlation function can be evaluated in closed form and is @xmath51 .",

    "it should rather be interpreted as a chaotic field with suppressed intensity correlations .",
    "this is not considered a problem , as the ase source will never fully exhibit a single - mode - laser  like behavior .",

    "a sufficient psd at the sr@xmath4 repumping wavelength of 1092 nm can be obtained from the ase of a laser - pumped ytterbium - doped fiber @xcite .",
    "this ase source consists of a pump diode laser and standard fiber optic components .",
    "the fact that it requires no frequency stabilization or external polarization modulation not only provides greater simplicity and reliability in operation , but also makes it a cost - effective alternative to , e.g. , a custom - ordered distributed feedback ( dfb ) laser .",
    "the emitted light is unpolarized and its transversal coherence is similar to that of a laser , so it can be focused to the spot size required for an ion trap .",
    "current sleds can deliver a few hundred @xmath193 at 1092 nm .",
    "as these typically emit nearly fully polarized light , two sleds have to be combined with orthogonal polarizations .",
    "taking into account losses and the need for filtering ( see below ) , this psd is at the lower limit of efficient ase repumping .",
    "more powerful sleds are expected to become available in the future .    one important question that needs to be addressed is whether there are any drawbacks related to the high total intensity of the ase field .",
    "if one uses a bandpass filter at the cooling - laser wavelength for fluorescence detection and ion imaging , these will not be affected by the repumper light .",
    "the ase spectrum might have a broad pedestal around the peak at 1092 nm .",
    "if this is the case , light at the clearout wavelength 1033 nm ( @xmath13-@xmath14 transition ) has to be filtered out , otherwise the repumper interferes with the detection of clock transitions .    due to the high total intensity of the ase light ,",
    "the light shift of the reference transition is large . if we assume an ase spectral width of 2 nm ( fwhm ) , corresponding to @xmath194 , and require @xmath195 , the light shift is @xmath196khz .",
    "the ase repumper light must therefore be carefully blocked during the clock pulse .",
    "the ase source can be switched off electronically by turning off the pump ( laser ) current in order to further increase the extinction ratio of the mechanical shutter or acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) used for switching .",
    "for the ase source parameters above , the light shifts of the cooling and clearout transitions are @xmath197 and 36khz , respectively , and can be neglected compared to the natural linewidth of these electric dipole transitions .    the transition strength of the clearout transition ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : energy - levels ] ) is similar to that of the repumping transition , and an ase source could be used also to replace the clearout laser that is used to return the ion to the cooling cycle after a quadrupole transition has occurred . in this case",
    ", the main advantage is that no frequency stabilization is required .",
    "if we first consider ions without hyperfine structure , the scheme described for @xmath2 in sec .",
    "[ sec : introduction ] applies also to the commonly used alkaline - earth - metal ions @xmath198 @xcite ( repumper wavelength 866 nm ) and @xmath199 @xcite ( 650 nm ) , as well as to other less abundant even isotopes of these elements .",
    "also in these ions , the clock transition is the @xmath10-@xmath12 quadrupole transition .",
    "the @xmath200 ion has a similar energy level scheme , except that its lowest excited state is the extremely metastable @xmath201 state . for @xmath200 ,",
    "the upper state of the repumping transition is usually the @xmath202_{1/2}$ ] state @xcite ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : energy - levels ] ) and an ase repumper at 935 nm could be used for @xmath203 both for the @xmath10-@xmath12 quadrupole clock transition @xcite and the @xmath10-@xmath204 octupole clock transition @xcite .",
    "odd isotopes with nuclear spin @xmath205 , thus featuring hyperfine structure , also have dark states within the @xmath0 state . in @xmath206 with @xmath207 , there are dark states in the @xmath208 and @xmath209 hyperfine levels that require polarization modulation @xcite . in addition , due to the hyperfine structure , there are three repumping transitions that need to be driven",
    ". this has been solved by frequency modulating the repumping laser over the few hundred mhz range of the hyperfine structure @xcite .",
    "in addition to destabilizing the dark states , a broadband ase repumper would solve this problem by driving all allowed @xmath0-@xmath11 hyperfine transitions .    of the odd isotopes , @xmath210 is particularly promising for optical clocks , as it has a minimal hyperfine structure due to its nuclear spin of @xmath211 and , in addition , has three possible clock transitions . here",
    ", an ase repumper could be used with the @xmath10-@xmath12 quadrupole and @xmath10-@xmath204 octupole @xcite clock transitions . at the national physical laboratory ( npl ) , a magnetic field around @xmath212 t",
    "is used to destabilize dark states in the @xmath0 manifold and two separate repumper lasers are used to empty its two hyperfine levels @xmath213 and @xmath214 @xcite . at physikalisch - technische bundesanstalt ( ptb ) ,",
    "a high laser intensity is used in order to deplete both the hyperfine levels and a 1 mt magnetic field , applied during the cooling period , destabilizes dark states in both the @xmath0 manifold and the @xmath215 state @xcite .",
    "again , a broadband ase repumper could drive all the allowed repumping transitions without creating dark states in arbitrarily low magnetic fields .",
    "an ase repumper can not be directly utilized with the third clock transition , @xmath216-@xmath217 , as the repumper in this case must be able to selectively address the @xmath218 level in order for the electron shelving technique to work @xcite .",
    "the oscillator strengths of the repumping transitions in @xmath219 @xcite and @xmath220 @xcite are comparable to that in sr@xmath4 @xcite , so the required psds are also similar .",
    "the oscillator strength of the @xmath0-@xmath221_{1/2}$ ] transition in @xmath200 is one order of magnitude lower @xcite , and thus the required psd is an order of magnitude higher .",
    "naturally , the availability of suitable ase sources has to be investigated for each wavelength .",
    "we have proposed using unpolarized , incoherent amplified spontaneous emission ( ase ) to drive the repumping transition in a trapped and laser - cooled single ion .",
    "we have constructed a theoretical model for the ase radiation and analyzed its performance compared to a single - mode laser repumper by solving the eight - level density - matrix equations for a sr@xmath4 ion .",
    "the performance of the ase repumper depends mainly on its power spectral density at the repumping wavelength and it works even if the field is partly polarized .",
    "we have also derived a reduced three - level system that can be solved exactly , enabling rapid comparison with experiments and optimization of experimental parameters .",
    "the required ase power spectral density can be obtained with current technology and the idea can be applied also to the clearout transition and to several other commonly used ions .",
    "an ase repumper prevents dark states from forming without external polarization modulation even in zero magnetic field .",
    "in addition , it requires no frequency stabilization due to the broad bandwidth .",
    "this makes it robust and compact , which is particularly important for transportable ion clocks .",
