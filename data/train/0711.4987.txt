    "the large @xmath3 and small @xmath4 branching ratios measured by the @xmath8 factories are still not completely understood @xcite : @xmath9 the predictions for @xmath10 from both the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) @xcite and qcd - improved factorization ( qcdf ) @xcite approaches in the feldmann - kroll - stech ( fks ) scheme @xcite for the @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing are smaller than the data .",
    "several resolutions to this puzzle have been proposed : a significant flavor - singlet contribution @xcite , a large @xmath11 transition form factor @xcite , a high chiral scale @xmath12 @xcite associated with the @xmath2 meson which is composed of the @xmath13 and @xmath14 content in the quark - flavor basis @xcite , an enhanced hadronic matrix element @xmath15 @xcite of the strange - quark pseudoscalar density due to axial @xmath5 anomaly @xcite , the long - distance charming penguin and gluonic charming penguin @xcite in the soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite , and inelastic final - state interaction ( fsi ) @xcite .",
    "the motivation of @xcite is to fix fsi effects using the data in eq .",
    "( [ data ] ) , and then to predict cp asymmetries in the @xmath16 decays .",
    "a sizable gluonic content in the @xmath1 meson was indicated from a phenomenological analysis of the relevant data @xcite , and also by the recent kloe measurement @xcite ( but see an opposite observation in @xcite ) .",
    "the flavor - singlet contributions to the @xmath17 branching ratios , containing those from the @xmath18 transition @xcite , from the spectator scattering @xcite , and from the weak annihilation , have been taken into account in qcdf @xcite .",
    "however , the gluonic contribution to the @xmath11 transition form factor was parameterized and increased arbitrarily up to 40% @xcite in order to explain eq .",
    "( [ data ] ) .",
    "this piece was also included in the parametrization for two - body nonleptonic @xmath8 meson decay amplitudes based on scet , but found to be destructive to the quark contribution from data fitting @xcite . to settle down this issue ,",
    "we have examined the gluonic contribution in the pqcd approach @xcite with the associated parameters being experimentally constrained , and observed that it is constructive and negligible ( of few percents at most ) in the @xmath19 transitions @xcite .",
    "our conclusion has been confirmed by the sum - rule analysis in @xcite .",
    "if so , one has to clarify what mechanism is responsible for the increase of the @xmath11 form factor postulated in @xcite .",
    "the chiral scale for the @xmath2 meson is defined by @xmath20 with the light quark mass @xmath21 under the exact isospin symmetry .",
    "the mass @xmath22 was increased from its generally accepted value 0.11 gev , close to the pion mass , to @xmath23 gev in @xcite .",
    "this enhancement then gives a larger @xmath24 decay amplitude , a more destructive ( constructive ) interference with the @xmath25 amplitude @xcite , where the @xmath26 meson is composed of the @xmath27 content in the quark - flavor basis , and thus a smaller @xmath4 ( larger @xmath28 ) branching ratio .",
    "it has been found that the pqcd results for the @xmath16 branching ratios corresponding to @xmath29 gev agree with the data @xcite .",
    "note that the pqcd results for the @xmath30 branching ratios are also consistent with the data , which show a tendency opposite to eq .",
    "( [ data ] ) : @xmath31 are smaller than @xmath32 by about a factor 4 @xcite .",
    "whether there is any mechanism to achieve the enhancement of @xmath22 is not clear .",
    "we shall argue that a tiny effect violating the okubo - zweig - iizuka ( ozi ) rule @xcite , which was neglected in the fks scheme , could be the responsible mechanism .",
    "the ozi - rule violation has been studied in , for example , exclusive @xmath33 productions from @xmath34 and @xmath35 scattering in a wide range of energy scales @xcite .",
    "most of the observed ratios of the cross sections , @xmath36 , are in agreement with or slightly larger than the expectation around 1.5 from the fks scheme , considering experimental uncertainties .",
    "the exceptions with significant ozi - rule violation appear in the @xmath33 productions at thresholds : the ratio @xmath37 was measured to be @xmath38 and @xmath39 with the proton energy being 2.9 mev and 4.1 mev , respectively @xcite .",
    "the above tendency hints the possibility of small ozi - rule violation in @xmath8 and @xmath40 meson decays into light final states , whose energy release is of order few gev .",
    "the proposal in @xcite relies on the large matrix element @xmath41 , which strengthens its difference from @xmath42 , and the difference between the @xmath43 and @xmath4 branching ratios through penguin contributions .",
    "it will be pointed out that this proposal demands larger ozi - rule violation , which is not obviously signaled in the @xmath44 data .    in sec .",
    "ii we show that few - percent ozi violating effects enhance the mass @xmath22 sufficiently , which accommodates the data of the @xmath16 branching ratios in the pqcd approach . in sec .",
    "iii we make a critical review on other proposals for this subject from both theoretical and experimental points of view .",
    "section  iv contains a summary , in which experimental discrimination for all the proposed mechanisms is suggested .",
    "we consider the following ozi - rule violating matrix elements in the quark - flavor basis , @xmath45 for the light quark @xmath46 or @xmath47 , where the decay constants @xmath48 and @xmath49 are expected to be small and have been neglected in the fks scheme .",
    "we also define the decay constants for the @xmath50 mesons and for the @xmath33 mesons : @xmath51 the physical states @xmath0 and @xmath1 are related to the flavor states @xmath2 and @xmath26 through @xmath52 with the unitary matrix @xmath53 the above decay constants are transformed into each other via @xmath54    we repeat the derivation of eq .",

    "( [ qsp ] ) , @xmath71 could reach 0.22 gev without the ozi violating effect .",

    "the consistency of the pqcd results @xcite with the data of the @xmath30 branching ratios is also improved by increasing @xmath22 .",

    "the pqcd results in eq .",

    "furthermore , the ratio of the observed @xmath44 branching ratios @xcite , @xmath128 does not reveal the same signal : under a monopole parametrization , it corresponds to the ratio of the @xmath129 form factors at the maximal recoil @xcite , @xmath130 in agreement with the expectation from the fks scheme .",
    "the gluonic contribution to the @xmath19 transitions also plays an essential role in the proposal of @xcite .",
    "it is destructive to the quark contribution from the data fitting based on scet , so that the @xmath19 form factors have small values of @xmath131 .",
