    "various cosmological observations , including the type ia supernova ( sne ia ) @xcite,@xcite , the cosmic microwave background radiation @xcite,@xcite and the large scale structure @xcite,@xcite , have revealed that the universe is in accelerating state . the most appealing candidate to explain this phenomenon is dark energy ( de ) that in a simplest form as the vacuum energy ( i.e. cosmological constant , @xmath0 ) inherits a constant equation of state ( eos ) parameter , @xmath1 .",
    "further , the de models with time dependent eos parameter have also been the subject of extensive investigation for nearly one decade .",
    "for example , cosmological models with quintessence @xcite , phantom @xcite , k - essence @xcite , tachyon @xcite,@xcite and quintom fields @xcite,@xcite ; as well as the chaplygin gas @xcite , the generalized chaplygin gas @xcite , holographic de ( hde)@xcite,@xcite , old and new agegraphic de @xcite,@xcite , and the ricci de @xcite are among the most promising models to reveal the physical phenomena in the universe dynamics .    from the above candidates for de the hde model is an attempt to apply the nature of de within the framework of quantum gravity @xcite that its energy density is given by , @xmath2 in ( [ rol ] ) , @xmath3 is planck mass , @xmath4 is a free dimensionless parameter with a constraint given by @xmath5 @xcite and coefficient three is for convenience . from @xcite",
    "we find that @xmath6 should be the future event horizon , @xmath7 with @xmath8 representing scale factor of the universe @xcite .",
    "the interacting hde model ( ihde ) , is a hde model which includes an interaction between dark sectors .",
    "it has been argued that with the interaction between dark energy and dark matter the old astrophysical structures can be formed naturally @xcite and the coincidence problem can be alleviated @xcite@xcite .",
    "also , among scalar field theories , both non - minimal coupling of the field to matter and tachyon model have been widely investigated in last few years @xcite@xcite and relevant works in the holographic tachyon models in both interacting and non interacting cases can be found in @xcite@xcite .    on the other hand , the relations between thermodynamics of space time and the nature of gravity is one of the most intriguing topics in theoretical physics .",
    "the thermodynamics laws of black hole were first derived from the classical einstein equation @xcite and followed by discovery of hawking radiation of black holes @xcite , @xcite .",
    "separately it has been shown that from the proportionality of entropy and horizon area together with the first law of thermodynamics one can derive the einstein equation @xcite .",
    "this implies a close relation between thermodynamics of space time and the einstein equation @xcite , @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors , by applying the first law of thermodynamics to the apparent horizon and assuming the geometric entropy is given by a quarter of the apparent horizon area , study the frw cosmology .    also , the thermodynamical properties of several cosmological models have been investigated recently and the authors have probed the first and second laws of thermodynamics in them . in @xcite",
    "the validity of thermodynamical laws in a dark energy filled universe has been discussed and in @xcite@xcite the laws of thermodynamics in modified gravity theories have been investigated . in @xcite",
    "the author deals with the second law of thermodynamics in the presence of interacting tachyonic field and another scalar field .",
    "also , in some hde and ihde models the authors have tried to discuss the laws of thermodynamics in flat and non - flat universes @xcite@xcite . in here , extending the previous works , we would like to study the thermodynamics properties of an ihde , by considering a tachyon cosmological model non - minimally coupled to matter lagrangian .",
    "we start with the action [ action ] s= where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are ricci scalar and matter lagrangian respectively , @xmath11 is a scalar tachyon field and @xmath12 represents its potential and @xmath13 is a scalar function where indicates the non - minimal coupling between matter and tachyon field . in a spatially flat frw cosmology ,",
    "the friedmann equation is given by @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "considering a hde and an interaction between de and cold dark matter ( cdm ) , the dynamical equation for de is given by [ omega_tac ] = -(1+z)^-1_tac[(1-_tac)(1+)- ] , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the eos parameter of the matter in the universe .",
    "also , from @xcite we have the evolution of tachyon field and hubble parameter as [ phiprime ] = , @xmath19 where the eos parameter for tachyon field representing de is given by [ omega_tac ] w_tac =--- from the above equations one can easily obtain the total eos and deceleration parameters @xmath20 for the model as @xmath21 in the following , we assume an exponential form of @xmath22 where the interacting parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 together with @xmath25 and @xmath26 for cdm determine the dynamics of the system .",
    "obviously , from interacting term @xmath27 , the @xmath28 or @xmath29 leads to the absence of the interaction . also , considering @xmath30 for radiation leads to @xmath31 and again we will not have any interaction .",
    "but in general because of the smallness of the interacting term @xmath27 , different values of @xmath18 does not affect the following results .    next , we find the constraints on the model parameters using @xmath32 method by utilizing recent observational data , including the observational hubble data ( ohd ) , the baryonic acoustic oscillation ( bao ) distance ratio and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation . by solving the equations ( [ omega_tac])-([hz3 ] ) for the dynamical variables @xmath33 , @xmath11 and @xmath34 and the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath23 , the constraints from a combination of ohd , bao and cmb can be obtained by minimizing @xmath35 .",
    "the results have been shown in table [ table:1 ] .",
    "for comparison , we also constrained the parameters @xmath34 and @xmath36 for @xmath0cdm model .",
    "table [ table:1 ] shows that , for ohd data , the @xmath0cdm model fits the observational data better than ihde model .",
    "however , considering the combination of ohd + bao + cmb , our model better fits the data in comparison to @xmath0cdm model .",
    "this can be justified by the fact that the contribution of bao and cmb data to the model are from earlier stage of universe whereas @xmath0cdm model describes only the recent behavior of the universe .",
    ".constraints on model parameters and initial conditions in our model and @xmath0cdm model [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table:1 ]    for example , the contour plots have been presented in fig.[conf ] show the confidence regions for the best fitted @xmath37 and @xmath4 in our model using ohd and combined ohd + bao + cmb data , respectively .",
    "we learn from this figure and also table [ table:1 ] that the combination of observational data make stronger constraints on this model parameters .     and @xmath4 using left ) ohd data , right ) combined ohd + bao + cmb data .",
    "the red , green and blue regions show 68.3% , 95.4% and 99.7% confidence regions , respectively.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=30.0% ]   and @xmath4 using left ) ohd data , right ) combined ohd + bao + cmb data .",
    "the red , green and blue regions show 68.3% , 95.4% and 99.7% confidence regions , respectively.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=30.0% ]",
    "by ascribing hde to the tachyon field in the model , @xmath38 , the event horizon becomes @xmath39 . with the apparent horizon given by @xmath40 ,",
    "the ratio between apparent and event horizon becomes @xmath41 .",
    "so , one easily find that the apparent horizon is in general smaller than the event horizon .",
    "as the thermodynamic laws are applicable in equilibrium , we first investigate whether these distances change dominantly over one hubble time and then we study the validity of the thermodynamic laws .",
    "so , let us calculate how much the horizons change over one hubble scale . for the apparent horizon , we have [ th ] t_h = so using ( [ hz3 ] ) , we obtain [ thfinal ] t_h&=&--- on the other hand , for the event horizon , we have [ th2 ] t_h=+similar to the case of apparent horizon , using differential equation for de , ( [ omega_tac ] ) and with attention to ( [ hz3 ] ) , we find [ th2final ] t_h&=&1- from numerical calculation and utilizing the best fitted model parameters , in fig.([thth ] )",
    ", we see that neither the apparent horizon nor the event horizon significantly change over one hubble scale .",
    "thus , the equilibrium thermodynamics can be applied here . resembling the black hole case",
    ", we have @xmath42 where @xmath43 stands for apparent ( @xmath44 ) or event ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "to investigate the first law of thermodynamics on apparent horizons , we have the total amount of energy crossing the apparent horizon during @xmath46 as -de=4r_a^2_tot(1+w_tot)dt=3(1+w_tot)/2dt . where @xmath47 .",
    "then using ( [ w ] ) , we get -de=(---)dt.[energy ] on the other hand , with the temperature and holographic entropy on the apparent horizon we obtain [ temp - entro ] t_ads_a&=&(---)dt . thus , we see that the first law of thermodynamics is satisfied on the apparent horizon , i.e. , @xmath48 .",
    "a similar argument can be applied to the case of event horizon .",
    "the energy flow through the event horizon reads -de&=&4r_e^2_tot(1+w_tot)dt=12 c^2_tac^-1(1+w_tot)dt + & = & 12 c^2_tac^-1(1 - --)dt . to write the first thermodynamics law on event horizon",
    ", we need to compute @xmath49 where [ redot ] & = & ( -1 ) . from the above relations it is obvious that @xmath50 which means the first law of thermodynamics is violated on the event horizon .",
    "we next study the second thermodynamics law and entropy for the model . from gibbs relation ,",
    "the entropy of the universe inside the horizon can be related to its energy and pressure in the horizon by t_xds_i , x = de+p_totdv . where @xmath51 .    for the apparent horizon , considering the volume @xmath52 , energy @xmath53 and pressure @xmath54",
    ", we have t_ads_i , a = dr_a/2+(3/2 ) w_totdr_a . using temperature relation @xmath55 ,",
    "we then find [ ds ] ds_i , a=(1 + 3 w_tot)r_adr_a . by variation of the internal entropy ( [ ds ] ) with respect to redshift , and using the relation @xmath56 , we obtain a differential equation for the entropy enveloped by the apparent horizon given by [ dsdtin ] & = & -(1 + 3 w_tot)h^-3 + & = & -(1-_tac--)h^-3 + & = & -2qh^-3 . on the other hand ,",
    "the evolution of the geometric entropy on the apparent horizon reads [ dsdton ] = -2 h^-3from equations ( [ dsdtin ] ) and ( [ dsdton ] ) , a relation between entropy inside and on the apparent horizon can be found as [ ration ] = q the above relation shows that for an accelerating universe , @xmath57 , the variation of internal and apparent entropy differs by a minus sign .",
    "also , for decelerating universe with @xmath58 , their variation with respect to redshift is the same .",
    "finally , one can obtain a differential equation for total entropy as [ aptoen ] = , and test the generalized second law ( gsl ) in the model .",
    "the gsl implies that the total entropy is an increasing function of time , @xmath59 , or equivalently @xmath60 .",
    "[ entropy]-left ) shows that independent of the dynamics of @xmath61 and @xmath62 , variation of total entropy is always negative .",
    "the graph also illustrates that at about @xmath63 in the past where universe acceleration begins , @xmath64 while @xmath65 .",
    "similarly , one can obtain the entropy inside an event horizon from : [ dsdtin2 ] = ( -2qh^-3-(1+q)_tac^-1h^-2 ) .",
    "also , geometric entropy on the event horizon can be read from [ dsdton2 ] = ( -2 h^-3-_tac^-1h^-2 ) . from equations ( [ dsdtin2 ] ) and",
    "( [ dsdton2 ] ) , a relation between entropy inside and on the event horizon can be found as @xmath66.\\ ] ] we therefore derive total entropy variation as [ evtoen ] = with numerical calculation fig .",

    "the first and generalized second thermodynamics laws are discussed for interacting holographic dark energy model of tachyon cosmology .",
    "the interaction term in the formalism is represented by coupling the tachyon scalar field to the matter lagrangian in the action .",
    "the theoretical ground of the cosmological model is tested by observational data . in comparison to @xmath0cdm model and for only ohd data our model is not in goof fit . however , when including bao and cmb data to the dataset , then our model better fits the observational data . by assuming apparent horizon for the universe , the verified model with the observational data",
    "does satisfy the first and generalized second thermodynamics laws and also predict recent cosmic acceleration .",
    "note that in our formalism we assume that the scalar field interact only with the matter field .",
    "however , one may also consider a geometric coupling of the field same as in brans - dicke cosmology or other cosmological models and obtain different results .",
