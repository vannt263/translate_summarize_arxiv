    "it is an experimental fact that the magnetic scattering of thermal neutrons from a magnetic material can be detected only over a fraction of the accessible range of the scattering vector and , unlike the nuclear scattering , vanishes out as this gets large .",
    "ascribed to the spatial distribution of the magnetic densities , which is modulated at the atomic scale and thus at the scale of the wavelength of the thermal neutrons , the underlying variation in the scattering amplitudes is extracted out through form factors associated to ions .",
    "a concrete advantage is that these depend on radial integrals that can be computed at once and tabulated for each ion and valence state . within the so - called dipole approximation",
    "the only unknowns then are the proportions of the spin and orbital magnetic moments attached to the ions .",
    "a further interest is that the expression of the differential scattering cross section is considerably simplified and adapted for the quantitative analysis of the static and dynamic correlation functions of magnetic moments .",
    "a number of magnetic phenomena thus can be investigated with more ease , for instance the long range or short range magnetic orders with the associated magnetic transitions or crossovers and the magnon excitations emerging from these orders , the configurations and dynamics of magnetic moments in spin glasses or in spin fluids , the excitation spectrum of low dimensional magnets or of arrays of molecular nanomagnets , et cetera .    with polarized neutrons , measurements can be performed at precisions which , interestingly , allow probing the actual spatial distribution of the magnetic densities .",
    "a wholly new set of features associated to these then become available to analysis , for instance the quantum states of the concerned ions , which requires the exact computation of the associated form factors , but also the degree of covalency with neighboring ions or of hybridization with conduction electrons or else the itinerant nature of the magnetic densities , which all might question about the use itself of form factors associated to single ions , the spin delocalization and polarization effects , which might inform about the exchange paths and mechanisms in magnets , et cetera .",
    "we qualitatively examine in the following the concept of form factor , then describe the method used for its precise measurement by polarized neutron in collinear magnets and finally provide with a survey of the algebra involved for their computation by the spherical tensor operator formalism .",
    "the aim of the lecture was to refresh our mind with concepts and methodologies that are not new but unfamiliar because they are not of frequent use .",
    "accordingly , there is nothing in this manuscript that can not be found elsewhere .",

    "a pure spatial state is insensitive to pure spin operators , therefore , because of the matrix element @xmath148 , the closure relation @xmath146 gets limited to the ionic states @xmath149 with the same spatial component as the @xmath115 .",

    "@xmath153 defines the so called _ extracted scalar form factor_. it is tempting to generalize this to non degenerate spatial states as @xmath154 which presupposes that the intra - atomic magnetic density @xmath83 is collinear .",
    "this often is a good approximation widely used in practice , in particular when the physical interest is rather focussed at the inter - atomic magnetic correlation , but should be considered with some caution .",
    "non collinear magnetic densities are naturally expected in the presence of an antiferromagnetic order or any non collinear magnetic order , for there is no reason to believe that the magnetic orientation would abruptly change at well - defined inter - atomic boundaries .",
    "the non collinear character of the intra - atomic magnetic densities even come out in collinear ferromagnets or in paramagnets under magnetic field owing to the relativistic spin - orbit interaction which couples the magnetic densities to the local environments .",
    "clear experimental evidences are revealed in precise measurements @xcite .",
    "strictly speaking , the concept of scalar form factors is limited .",
    "according to the exact computations detailed in the last section , the spherical components of the quantity @xmath155 in the eq .  , for ionic states @xmath115 belonging to the same electronic configuration @xmath138 , can be put in the global form @xmath156 where @xmath157 are spherical harmonics over the spherical angles @xmath158 of the scattering vector and @xmath159 gather matrix elements between angular momentum states and geometrical factors . at a first sight",
    "these appear algebraically complicated , involving coefficients of fractional parentage and summations over wigner symbols , but in fact are formally not difficult to evaluate whatever the ionic states @xmath115 .",
    "@xmath160 are index k radial integrals : @xmath161 where @xmath143 is the radial wavefunction associated with the electronic configuration",
    ". these can be calculated at once and tabulated for each ion and valence by numerically solving the hartree - fock problem for the electrons interacting with the nucleus and between them in the one - electron central potential approximation . with the heavy ions the experimental measurements are enough precise to evidence significant deviation due to relativistic effects , for instance in the lanthanide or actinide series the f electrons are radially",
    "more expanded .",
    "accordingly , the radial integrals for these ions are numerically calculated from the relativistic dirac - fock hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "this , in addition to the dirac one - electron hamiltonian and the electron - electron coulomb interaction , includes the breit interaction , which is treated as a first order perturbation , in order to partially take into account the relativistic character of the interaction between the electrons : the coulomb interaction is not lorentz covariant but emerges as the leading term in an expansion of the interaction energy in powers of the fine structure constant obtained by the methods of quantum electrodynamics .",
    "as to be consistent the scattering amplitude also should be calculated on relativistic states from the relativistic expression of the current density operator @xmath162 , where @xmath163 is the dirac vector operator for the @xmath101electron ( notice that in the non relativistic limit this split back into the sum of a spin and a convection current density operators ) @xcite .",
    "we shall not get into the details of the formulation , which is too weighty to be account for in these notes but can be found elsewhere .",
    "an effective operator approach is considered in these works which allows expressing the matrix elements of relativistic operators over relativistic states as matrix elements of effective operators over non relativistic states .",
    "it has been argued that weak corrections might occur in addition to the radial one , answerable primarily to the relativistic mass - correction term , which decreases the convection current density in the high - kinetic - energy region near the nucleus thus producing a more spatially extended current density , and secondarily to the relativistic spin - orbit term , which slightly changes the effective electronic @xmath164 factor . in practice , these effects are ignored and the relativistic scattering amplitude is obtained from the non relativistic one by merely replacing the radial integrals by their relativistic counterpart .    when the inverse modulus @xmath165 of the scattering vector @xmath66 is much larger than the mean radius of the radial wavefunction of the unpaired electrons giving rise to the magnetic scattering the magnetic vector form factor can be approximated by the very simplified expression @xmath166 \\vec{\\mathbf{l } } ~ \\right \\vert \\lambda_{i}^{\\mathrm p } \\right",

    "as discussed in the last section , this is inferred from the behavior of the spherical bessel functions for small arguments and defines the _ dipole approximation _ to the scattering amplitude .",
    "notice that the form factor then is isotropic in the reciprocal space , that is it depends solely on the modulus of the scattering vector and not on its spherical angles . if the unpaired electrons are in an orbital singlet state then @xmath169 , which gives a scalar form factor @xmath170 at small scattering angle .",
    "this often applies to the d electrons of the 3d transition metal ions , which , owing to their spatial extension , often experience strong crystalline electric field in the materials .",
    "generally , the quenching is partially raised by the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "this acts as a perturbation weakly coupling the ground orbital state with excited orbital states , thus inducing a small orbital moment .",
    "the total magnetic moment of the ion then differs slightly from that of the spin contribution and comes out through a value of the electron gyromagnetic ratio @xmath171 different from that of the naked electron @xmath164 . in order to keep the spin operator as the basic variable it is convenient so set @xmath172 , which determines @xmath171 , in which case @xmath173 \\vec{\\mathbf{l } } \\}$ ]",
    "is expressed in the form @xmath174 where @xmath175 notice that we systematically set @xmath176 .",
    "unlike the d electrons of the 3d transition metal ions the f electrons of the lanthanide ions are much less extended , thus are subject to weaker crystalline electric field in the materials , whereas their spin - orbit interaction is strongly increased , becoming dominant .",
    "accordingly , the total spin @xmath167 and total orbital @xmath168 moments are first coupled to form the angular moment @xmath177 and the energy spectrum gets structured in terms of the multiplets @xmath178 on which the crystalline electric field potential will act as a perturbation . within each multiplet",
    "the wigner - eckart theorem allows writing @xmath179 , @xmath180 and @xmath181 , where @xmath182 , @xmath183 and @xmath184 are geometrically determined from @xmath185 and @xmath186 , using the identity @xmath187 : @xmath188 thus , if the initial @xmath189 and final @xmath190 states belong to the same multiplet @xmath191 then @xmath192 where @xmath193 if the initial @xmath194 and final @xmath195 states belong to different multiplets @xmath196 then @xmath197 so that @xmath198 .",
    "it in this case follows that @xmath199 where @xmath200 so far the unpaired electrons giving rise to the magnetic scattering were assumed kinematically independent from atomic center to atomic center , but this , in the real magnetic materials , is more the exception than the rule : the states of neighboring centers get mixed by the inter - atomic exchange interactions , there may be covalent transfer from ligand ions surrounding the magnetic ions , modifying the states of these and creating spin polarization on the ligand ions , the electrons under concern may tend to participate to metallic bonding , et cetera .",
    "the magnetic scattering then contains multi - center matrix elements and its computation become more difficult .",
    "we shall not get into the details of the different instances , for these are quite varied , and shall only emphasize that the robustness of the one - center states is such that the use of the ionic - like form factors is often a good approximation .",
    "thus , in most instances the intra - atomic exchange interactions are much larger than the inter - atomic exchange interactions , freezing out atomic or ionic angular momentum states on which these act as a perturbation , and the overlap mechanisms giving rise to these generally modify the spatial wavefunctions at large radial distance .",
    "accordingly , the electrons preserve an atomic or ionic character and can be analyzed as if they were kinematically independent , at least at not too small modulus @xmath201 of the scattering vector .",
    "actually , even when more significant effects on the scattering amplitude might be expected , for instance in the presence of strong ion - ligand covalent transfer , the single ion analysis is worth performing for it might allow assessing the relevance of the multi - center contributions .",
    "the case of itinerant electrons must be treated separately , using wannier functions .",
    "these show strong atomic - like character in the case of 3d transition metals and 3d - 4f ( or 5f ) intermetallics and , ignoring the s electrons , spread essentially over the @xmath202 nearest neighbors . labeling these with vectors @xmath203",
    ", the magnetic scalar form factor @xmath204 can be assigned to each atomic center , where w is a wannier expansion coefficient and @xmath205 an ionic scalar form factor .",
    "the interesting point is that if @xmath66 is a reciprocal vector @xmath206 then @xmath207 , that is the itinerant nature will not be seen by elastic scattering . in the case of 4d , 5d and 6d itinerant electrons , strong deviations from any ionic scalar form factor",
    "are generally found out even in the elastic scattering , signaling that the atomic integrity of these electrons then gets destroyed .",
    "neutron experiments give access to the differential scattering cross section .",
    "this is given by the square modulus of the scattering amplitude @xmath208 $ ] , statistically averaged over the initial states of the sample and spin states of the incoming neutron and summed over all the final states of the sample and spin states of the outgoing neutron , @xmath209 \\right \\vert^{2 } \\delta \\left [ \\frac{\\hbar^{2 } ( k_{i}^{2}-k_{f}^{2})}{2m_{\\mathrm n } } + e_{i}-e_{f } \\right]\\ ] ] where the dirac delta generalized function expresses the constraint of energy conservation .",
